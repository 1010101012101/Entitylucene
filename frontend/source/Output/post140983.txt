Battery Life on MBPr (2014 model) with*out* dedicated GPU <body> I am considering to try MBPr (late 2014 models) coming from Windows environment, which means that I would still need to use Windows about 50% of the time.br One of the strong points in favour of MBPr is the battery life, but it seems to be not so great when running Windows.  From what I learned from various discussions, short battery life and overheating are heavily influenced by constant usage of codeNVIDIA GeForce GT 750M/code while Apple does not provide a possibility to use codeIris/code.  What I fail to find in the internet is the following: if one were to buy MBPr without a dedicated graphic card (only on-board codeIris/code), how does running Windows via Bootcamp behave in this case?
