Examine a .DS_Store file? <body> My understanding of a .DS_Store file is that is contains details that describe a folder and the files within that folder. Based on that description, I can think of a few uses from being able to read a .DS_Store file.  My question: Is there any form of a tool or program that would allow for the reading/examination of a .DS_Store file?  Follow up question: If there's not a tool, can anyone explain to me the syntax of the file?  <answer249264> You can use codehexdump/code or codexxd/code to inspect the file contents directly - it is a binary file.   I would start with a perl or Python package rather than reinvent the wheel.   ul lihttp://search.cpan.org/~wiml/Mac-Finder-DSStore/DSStoreFormat.pod/li lihttps://pypi.python.org/pypi/ds_store/li /ul  <comment294840> Did you have a look at the [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/.DS_Store) page? Especially the sentence "Its internal structure is proprietary"? And there are links to some pages with reverse-engineered format at the bottom of the article too.
