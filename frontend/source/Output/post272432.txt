(SheepSaver error) Sorry, the desktop folder on the startup disk could not be created. Try unlocking the disk <body> I've been having problems with a SheepSaver installation (see my other question Unusual problem with Swoop on Mac OS 9.0.4 under SheepSaver) so decided to start from scratch and create a second SheepSaver installation. But instead this time I followed the instructions from here http://www.columbia.edu/~em36/sheepshaverwrapper.html  All was going well, but when I get to step 3b I get this error  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KFB1x.png" alt="enter image description here" If I click OK, SHeepSaver just starts again and gives the same error.  The startup disk is a disk image created in Disk Utility and it has to be locked to work with sheepsaver, so its not like i can unlock it. Plus it's an image of the Mac OS 8.5.1 install CD.  I searched the various mac OS 9 / Sheepsaver forums, but this error message doesn't seem to be discussed anywhere.  What gives?  How do I fix it?  Any ideas welcome. :)  <answer272637> I had a look at the SheepSaver Wrapper page you're using and think they've essentially been too clever by half. I followed it a few times and ran into various problems I then had to resolve myself.  If I was you, I would stick to the setup at emaculation instead.  However, if you're going through all this effort to try and play Swoop (as per your other question) I suggest it's just not worth the effort. Just my two cents worth.  <comment342415> Are you sure it's Step 3a? Your question states _The startup disk is a disk image created in Disk Utility_, but I had a look at the link and you should be using Step 3b (not Step 3a). <comment342430> Thank you sir! I have corrected my question. But the issue persists as I mistakenly had 3a in the question but was actually doing 3b.
