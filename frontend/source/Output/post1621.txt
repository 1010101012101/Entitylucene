How can I make Safari cmd+number shortcut switch tabs instead of opening the bookmark associated with that number? <body> I'm used to switching tabs with cmd+x where x is a number and takes me to tab x in firefox and pretty much every other browser I've ever used. I like safari's speed and would like to try it a bit, but the cmd+x shortcut is burned in my brain and every time I use safari I end up screwing up. I'd like to know if its possible to change this behavior, because this simple thing is a stopper for me.  <answer1622> What about setting bookmarks 0-9 to be bookmarklets that change window tabs?  <answer17221> Check SafariTabSwitching.  <answer108670> Easy!  kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdTab/kbd and kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbdTab/kbd  <answer108719> In case you are coming from Chrome and want to use   kbdcmd/kbd+kbd[0-9]/kbd for switching tabs (instead of cycling through your preset top sites) take a look at:  github.com/rs/SafariTabSwitching     Safari Tab Switching is a Safari SIMBL plugin which allow switching between tabs using Cmd+1-9.   strongUpdate:/strong  Safari Version 9.0.2 (El Capitan) has native support for this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eZp4V.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer132089> In most native OS X applications, the key presses kbdCmd/kbd-kbdShift/kbd-kbd[/kbd and kbdCmd/kbd-kbdShift/kbd-kbd]/kbd will cycle left and right through tabs, respectively. Safari understands these.  If you use something like BetterTouchTool, then you can assign gestures (such as a three-finger swipe left or right) to these key presses, and get tab cycling across most of OS X.  <answer132952> ul liTo go to the previous tab, press kbd⌘ Command/kbd kbd⇧ Shift/kbd kbd← Left/kbd /li liTo go to the next tab, press kbd⌘ Command/kbd kbd⇧ Shift/kbd kbd→ Right/kbd /li /ul  emTraveller’s note :/em These keyboards equivalents may be reversed in a right-to-left environment.   <answer141232> Yes ctrl + (0-9) by using this shortcut you can navigate across multiple tabs in windows  <answer159808> kbdcontrol/kbd-kbdtab/kbd the simplest way  <answer192396> To go to the next tab br /kbd⎇ Control/kbd+kbdTab/kbd or br / kbd⇧ Shift/kbd+kbd⌘ Command/kbd+kbd]/kbd or br /kbd⇧ Shift/kbd+kbd⌘ Command/kbd+kbd→ Right/kbd  To go to the previous tab br /kbd⎇ Control/kbd+kbd⇧ Shift/kbd+kbdTab/kbd or br /kbd⇧ Shift/kbd+kbd⌘ Command/kbd+kbd[/kbd or br /kbd⇧ Shift/kbd+kbd⌘ Command/kbd+kbd← Left/kbd  <answer196918> I personally like the keyboard shortcut used in Chrome and Opera: Option+Cmd+(left/right arrow keys). This can be assigned in System Preferences--Keyboard--Shortcuts--App Shortcuts. Press the plus button and add a pair for Safari with the command names "Show [Previous/Next] Tab" and then type the key sequences you want to use. Pretty handy. Good luck!  <answer201259> In El Capitan, OSX 10.11, this has been included as a new feature of Safari Version 9.0 (11601.1.50).   Go to Preferences  Tabs  Use ⌘-1 through ⌘-9 to switch tabs  <answer208513> Safari 9.0, released today for 10.9 Mavericks and 10.10 Yosemite, along side with the 10.11 El Capitan release, has introduced this natively.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iUF2I.png" alt="enter image description here"  There are two options. If checked, ⌘-1 through ⌘-9 will switch to tab 1 through 9, respectfully. This will change the original behavior of mapping to the favorites bar bookmark 1 through 9. Those will be changed to Command-Option-1 through Command-Option-9.  strongIf unchecked, while it does not say it/strong, the behavior is reversed. Command-Number will still be the favorites bar bookmark, while Command-Option-Number will be the tab. This flipping of behavior matches the Command-Click and Command-Option click behavior for opening a link.  It's undocumented.  <comment1946> Looks like my only option, so far... I'll try that. <comment4524> how can this be done? <comment4539> @yanis - if there's something specific you want to know, your best bet is to open a new question. <comment58113> This works perfectly for me. Safari 5.1.2/Lion. <comment102484> In addition, the current (6.0.3) behaviour of replacing whatever one had on the browser window is highly annoying. I often press cmd-1/2/3 in accident (i.e. while taking screen shots using shift-cmd-3/4). These keys REALLY should be reassigned by Apple. Bad feature. (I'm not the only one: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3464021?start=0&tstart=0) <comment102485> Works for Safari 6.0.3/Mountain Lion :D <comment127239> Works great in Safari 7/Mavericks too. <comment157278> Updated for Safari 8 (10538.35.8) / Yosemite (10.10, 14A238x) too. <comment161096> I go with these because they stack nicely with history.back and history.forward (Cmd-[ and Cmd-] respectively). Cursor keys often get stuck on input fields when attempting to navigate history. <comment161103> One more thing: the fact that "Show Previous Tab" and "Show Next Tab" are present in the Safari menu means that you can assign _any_ shortcuts for changing tabs in System Preferences (Keyboard-Shortcuts) <comment166455> Could you explain how control + 0 is different than command + 0 ? <comment168538> This is much nicer than Ctrl+Tab! <comment168624> By "in windows" venu means "in Windows" -- It is, in this context, an entirely pointless and unhelpful suggestion. Ctrl for Windows, Cmd for OSX. <comment178746> This is exactly what I was looking for. I just updated to Yosemite and I was hoping to replace Chrome with Safari and cmd + 0-9 was one of the shortcuts I was missing. Thanks! <comment182045> This suggestion is incorrect on OS X. Control-digits do nothing in Safari, and Command-digits open items in the Favorites bar. <comment214076> This did not work for me. I run safari 8.0.4 and Even though installation was successful, the `cmd` + `[0-9]` shortcut does not work <comment214182> @gprasant I'm running Version 8.0.4 too. Perhaps have a look at the issue tracker on github? <comment214216> UPDATE: Looking at this issue - https://github.com/rs/SafariTabSwitching/issues/27 - helped me fix the problem. It now works for me on Safari 8.0.4 <comment235356> It seems you have answered your own question. That's a good way to share your knowledge, as said in Stack Exchange FAQs. <comment240815> this answer is the most complete <comment243481> OMG! FINALLY!

This should be upvoted more! <comment253669> As of OS X El Capitan, this feature is now enabled by default in Safari. <comment255921> That's what I need. <comment262370> Now I wish Finder tab can use the same shortcut!
