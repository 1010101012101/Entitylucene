Is there a Mac screen capture tool that will export to animated gif? <body> I'm looking for a screen capture tool working on MacOSX that will export the capture to animated gif.  <answer46039> h2Semi-automated process:/h2  If you need to capture video and convert it to GIF, or a very long involved sequence of steps, then you'll need to combine two separate programs.  A video screen capture tool, and a movie to gif conversion tool.  Look at these two questions for possible solutions:  Screen video capture application  How can I convert a .mov into a .gif (or a .apng)?  There don't seem to be that many apps that do the movie -- gif conversion on OS X, though.  A lot of people use VLC to capture frames and imagemagick to collect them back together into an animated gif.  This is probably why the only answer to the conversion question above used an online service.  h2Manual process:/h2  There is a way to do it in OS X without an additional tool, and this works well if, for instance, you just want to show someone the sequence of steps to disable a particular system preference.  The basic process is this:  ol liUse Cmd-shift-4-spacebar to capture a screenshot of the window for each frame./li liConvert the images to gif (or set your screenshot preferences to gif prior to capturing the screenshots)/li liOpen the last screenshot in preview./li liOpen the sidebar in preview/li liShow the screenshots in finder, ordered by date/li liSelect the remainder to the screenshots, drag and drop them directly on top of the icon in the sidebar of preview for the file already opened.  If you drop them elsewhere it won't add them properly./li liPreview the animation by selecting the top icon in the sidebar, then using the down arrow.  Rearrange any that are out of order using the sidebar to drag and drop./li liSave the document as gif, and then preview using a browser, or another app that shows animated gifs./li /ol  This technique is somewhat limited in that you can't easily capture video frames without pausing the video before each capture (for that you should get a video screencapture program and then convert the resulting mov or avi to animated gif), and you can't readily adjust the frame time for each frame.

I don't like it as it would be much too tedious. Thanks for the answer though. <comment52526> That's a good point. Animated gifs are great because they are widely supported and don't require a plugin. <comment52527> Impossibly tedious for anything other than a super simple animation. The "typing text in a TextEdit" window example that accompanies this approach on all the web pages that talk about it is about as complicated as you'd want to get with this. <comment52537> Ok @Adam, thank you for expanding on your answer. The semi-automated seems to be a lot better than the manual process, however, I'm still surprised it's not already in existence as a feature in some of the larger screen capture tools. <comment52552> @KyleHayes Camtasia for PC captures and can export as an animated gif, but Camtasia for Mac doesn't export to gif (yet?).  It's probably worthwhile calling them and finding out if they have plans to release that feature in the future. <comment52589> That's a good lead. Thanks <comment59457> I just used that site to convert a ScreenFlow capture to an animated .gif for my IT how-to wiki, worked great - thanks. <comment93621> Tutorial link is dead. <comment109312> and just in time for me, hurray ! <comment109313> Works absolutely brilliant and simple on 10.6. Kyle, reconsider this to be your accepted answer ! <comment110522> Reconsidered and gave it a trial run...this is perfect! Works great on my Mac but now would like to see it on RedHat ;-) It's always something. <comment114014> This question is basically a shopping request. If you could explain a bit about your situation and why one app you use or have found doesn't work, that would enable people to add longer answers other than one line links to potential products.  <comment146339> Awesome! thank you! <comment207158> Greetings from the future.  Awesome tool. <comment346339> Try this open source GifCapture, which is written in Swift https://github.com/onmyway133/GifCapture <comment346509> Thanks @onmyway133. I tried this tool this morning and it also works as a nice option.
