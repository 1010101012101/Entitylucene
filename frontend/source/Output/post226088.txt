Cannot use Disk Utility to create partition from free space on external USB drive <body> I have a 3 TB Western Digital red disk in a USB hard drive dock.  The drive is GPT, and I have two volumes on it (one volume is "Microsoft Reserved", other volume is NTFS).  The other part of my drive is 1.5 TB of free space. I verified this on my Windows machine:  precodeDISKPART&gt; list disk    Disk ###  Status         Size     Free     Dyn  Gpt   --------  -------------  -------  -------  ---  ---   Disk 0    Online          167 GB    20 GB   Disk 1    Online          465 GB      0 B        *   Disk 2    Online         2794 GB  1526 GB        *  DISKPART&gt; select disk 2  Disk 2 is now the selected disk.  DISKPART&gt; list part    Partition ###  Type              Size     Offset   -------------  ----------------  -------  -------   Partition 1    Reserved           128 MB    17 KB   Partition 2    Primary           1267 GB   129 MB /code/pre  DiskPart shows 2 partitions - one 128 MB, and the other 1267 GB with 1526 MB of free space.  I took this drive over to my MacBook Pro running OS X El Capitan 10.11.3 and fired up Disk Utility, but for some reason it doesn't look like Disk Utility is seeing the free space, so I can't create a new volume.  Here are some screenshots:  … of the physical disk in Disk Utility (notice how there doesn't appear to be any unallocated space on the disk to create another volume:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yelyH.png" alt="Disk Utility Drive Overview"  … of the two volumes in Disk Utility. Notice how the plus sign is greyed out so that I cannot create another partition with the free space.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8YBHo.png" alt="enter image description here"  I want to put encrypted Time Machine backups on the second partition that I create from the free space. Does that mean that I need to create the new partition from a Mac?  <answer226123> I think Disk Utility misses a proper EFI partition at the beginning of the disk.  If you don't want to completely erase the drive you should be successful following the steps below:  ul liOpen Terminal and enter the following to get an overview:  precodediskutil list /code/pre  The 3 TB disk is your external disk. In the next steps I assume the disk identifier of your external disk is disk1/li liGet the block size of the external disk:  precodediskutil info disk1 | grep "Device Block Size" /code/pre  In the next steps I assume that the Device Block Size is 512 bytes. If you get another block size (i.e. 4096 bytes) leave a comment./li liGet the partition table of the external disk:  precodesudo gpt -r show /dev/disk1 /code/pre  The result is similar to the output below (your sizes are different though):  precode       start        size  index  contents            0           1         PMBR            1           1         Pri GPT header            2          32         Pri GPT table           34      262144      1  GPT part - E3C9E316-0B5C-4DB8-817D-F92DF00215AE       262178        2014                264192  2244603904      2  GPT part - EBD0A0A2-B9E5-4433-87C0-68B6B72699C7   2244868096  2048002015            4292870111          32         Sec GPT table   4292870143           1         Sec GPT header /code/pre/li liUnmount the external disk:  precodediskutil umountDisk /dev/disk1 /code/pre/li liNow add a third partition with   precodesudo gpt add -b 2244870110 -i 3 -s 1000000000 -t 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC disk1 /code/pre  I left some unallocated space (2014 blocks) between partition 2 and 3.   The resulting partition table looks like this then:  precode       start        size  index  contents            0           1         PMBR            1           1         Pri GPT header            2          32         Pri GPT table           34      262144      1  GPT part - E3C9E316-0B5C-4DB8-817D-F92DF00215AE       262178        2014                264192  2244603904      2  GPT part - EBD0A0A2-B9E5-4433-87C0-68B6B72699C7   2244868096        2014            2244870110  1000000000      3  GPT part - 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC   3244870110  1048000001            4292870111          32         Sec GPT table   4292870143           1         Sec GPT header /code/pre  You should choose a bigger size than 1000000000 blocks. The number of blocks has to be dividable through 8. The max size in my case would have been 2048000000 (1000000000 + 1048000001)./li liNow format the new partition with a file system and name the volume (in the example below emBackup/em):  precodesudo newfs_hfs -J -v "Backup" /dev/disk1s3 /code/pre/li liMount the volume and verify it:  precodediskutil mount /dev/disk1s3 diskutil verifyVolume /dev/disk1s3 /code/pre/li /ul  <comment274494> You might have better luck with a command-line tool - `diskutil list` on OS X would show you exactly the same information as DISKPART. My guess is OS X is declining to mess with a drive it didn't set up since write support for NTFS and other filesystems is not part of OS X. Why not use the PC tool to make a FAT filesystem that OS X can then rework if that's your end game? <comment274515> Thanks grgarside. I want to put encrypted Time Machine backups on the second partition that I create from the free space. Does that mean that I need to create the new partition from a Mac?
