3rd Gen iPad photostream <body> I just bought an iPad for my mother and now I would like to turn on Photostream so she can see them.  Is there a setting I can change to make this possible?  <answer57269> In codeSettings/code, login to iCloud (under the codeiCloud/code tab) and there you will get the option for Photo stream.  You can also go to the codePhotos/code tab in codeSettings/code and enable Photostream there. If you haven't logged into your iCloud account yet, the switch either won't be there or will prompt for login information.  If you are talking about sharing Journals in iPhoto through iCloud, start by creating a Journal, then tap the Share icon in the upper right corner, tap codeiCloud/code and follow the prompts.  <comment65777> If you're looking for general information - you can't do better than the [FAQ Apple has prepared for the service](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4486). Feel free to ask another more specific question or edit this one if you need more help.
