Updated Operating System Lightroom Problem <body> I updated the operating system on my iMac so I had to back up my applications to external hard drive.  My problem now is, I have lightroom back on the iMac but it hasn't got any of my presets i made?  I also had to put the serial number thingy back in before it would open? I really need my presets, it took me months to make them all!  <comment340598> "Updated" alone wouldn't alter anything. You mean you wiped it & installed a fresh new OS? or...?
