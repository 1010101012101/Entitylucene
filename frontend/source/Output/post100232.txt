Weird graphics issues after waking MacBook up <body> After locking my Mac and waking it up a few hours later this is how it looks:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qR96f.jpg" alt="Some weird stuff going on"  Also, some of the icons look weird after restarting the system (for example not fully rendered time machine icon: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/p746R.png" alt="" )  strongHardware:/strong mid 2013 MacBook Air - i5 1,5GHz 128SSD, 8GB RAM.  I suspect one thing, however this is my first mac and I prefer not to mess around anymore: The problem started ocurring after I have disabled the swap.  Earlier I did research how much memory I use (&lt;4GB RAM and ~2GB swap) and decided to remove the swap to force RAM usage.  What could be causing this behaviour?
