Is it possible to have more than one remote Mac open in Remote Desktop at a time? <body> Is it possible to have more than one remote Mac open in Apple's Remote Desktop software at a time ?   Some tasks take a while on some computers so I'd like to be able to dip in and out of multiple machines whilst its working. Is that possible?  <answer267451> Yes, but you have to select the machines one at a time and click the "control" button.  <comment335585> You can have a window-full of observed machines. I've never tested it [cos I don't have enough machines here] but can you observe, then swap to control on a new machine, then another... all from that window  ? <comment335631> From my, admittedly very limited experience, it works similarly to Microsoft RDP. Each window is a separate remote connection and you don't swap the contents of one window (Mac #1) for another (Mac #2) you swap the window itself. Simple and easy though.
