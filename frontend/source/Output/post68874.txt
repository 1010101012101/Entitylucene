Can I make the caps-lock setting stick, for external USB keyboard in Mountain Lion? <body> I have a Macbook Pro running Mountain Lion, and I frequently use an (external) Apple USB keyboard with it.  In the Keyboard sys prefs, I set the "caps lock" key to be "^ Control", for both "Apple Internal Keyboard / Trackpad" and "Apple Keyboard" (i.e., external).  When I unplug the external keyboard, and plug it in again, though, the "caps lock" key once again is a caps lock key.  I can set it back in the sys prefs, but it only lasts until I unplug it next.  I have a different Mac running 10.7, with the same caps lock setting, and when I unplug the external USB keyboard, the caps lock setting stays set.  Is this by design?  Is it a bug?  Is there a workaround?  Can I make Mountain Lion remember my caps lock setting somehow?  <answer68878> It should stick even on Mountain Lion.  Two suggestions.  First, you might use Onyx to validate your preferences.    Second, try deleting ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.systempreferences.plist and logging out and logging in again.    In either case, the pref file might be messed up and that could prevent it from being saved.
