Terminal command that is the same as copy paste in Finder? <body> I'm curious. As far as codecp/code and codersync/code I see all these different options. Correct me if I'm wrong, but if you copy + paste in Finder, lets say from one hard drive to another, it should preserve:  ul liAll file attributes (access time, modified time etc.)/li liAll Symbolic Links/li liRecurse through the directory structure/li li(Can't think of anything else to preserve)?/li /ul  So in the end, when you copy paste in Finder, everything will be strongan exact copy/strong, just located in a different parent directory.  What I'm looking for is a command that mimics exactly what Finder does when you copy + paste. That will answer this question...  If it turns out Finder doesn't do what I think it does please explain, and show the command line equivalents for what Finder emactually/em does... it must be calling a command when you use the GUI - right?  <answer274601> If you want to preserve file attributes, symbolic links, and recursive structure, codersync/code should suffice:  precodersync -a ~/somefolder /Volumes/SomeUSB/ /code/pre  The code-a/code (archive) flag is a shortcut for the following codersync/code options:     code--recursive/code recurse into directoriesbr /   code--links/code copy symlinks as symlinksbr /   code--perms/code preserve permissionsbr /   code--times/code preserve timesbr /   code--group/code sets the group of the destination file to be the same as the source filebr /   code--owner/code sets the owner of the destination file to be the same as the source file (if you're copying to a remote system, the remote SSH user will need to have superuser status for this)br /   code--devices/code rsync will transfer character and block device files to the remote system.   <comment345201> What you need is the ditto command that does exactly the same as copy files in Finder. See man ditto for additional information.
