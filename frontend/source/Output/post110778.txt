open new tab in iTerm and execute command there <body> I have found way to open new tab in codeiTerm/code:  precodenewtabi() {     osascript -e 'tell application "iTerm" to activate' -e 'tell application "System Events" to tell process "iTerm" to keystroke "t" using command down' } /code/pre  And I want to execute some commands in new tab. Let it be simple command codepwd/code. How to do it?   If I run ...  precodenewtabi &amp;&amp; pwd /code/pre  The new tab is opened as expected, but codepwd/code command is executed not in new tab but in old one, where I typed codenewtabi &amp;&amp; pwd/code  I use codezsh/code. My os is codeOS X 10.8.5/code  <answer110788> Use codetell session -1 of current terminal to write text "pwd"/code:  precodeactivate application "iTerm" tell application "System Events" to keystroke "t" using command down tell application "iTerm" to tell session -1 of current terminal to write text "pwd" /code/pre  <answer149099> precodeosascript \ -e 'tell application "iTerm" to activate' \ -e 'tell application "System Events" to tell process "iTerm" to keystroke "t" using command down' \ -e 'tell application "System Events" to tell process "iTerm" to keystroke "ls"' \ -e 'tell application "System Events" to tell process "iTerm" to key code 52' /code/pre  <comment131600> if opened more than one `iTerms`, it opens new tab in correct `iTerm` instance, but writes `pwd` in last tab of first instance of iTerm <comment131601> @efr You're right. I edited the answer to change `terminal 1` to `current terminal`. Now it should run the command in the current window instead of the window that was opened first.
