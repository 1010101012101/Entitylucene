mac screen sharing issue <body> I have an issue using screen sharing between 2 macs, it won't connect and it just gives me an error. It worked fine with my old tp link router but I had to change that router with a new one from the isp because they use a new PON cable now as opposed to regular ethernet, so screen sharing just gives me an error now. Is there any specific setting that needs to be enabled in the router settings so screen sharing can work ?
