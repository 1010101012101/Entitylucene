Piping into printf <body> In Terminal, I'm trying to replace strongMY_SUBJECT/strong and strongBODY_OF_EMAIL/strong from the command below:  precodeprintf "From: Sender Name &lt;sender@domain.com&gt;\nTo: recipient@domain.com\nSubject: MY_SUBJECT\n\nBODY_OF_EMAIL\n" | /usr/sbin/sendmail -F "Sender Name" -f "sender@domain.com" "recipient@domain.com" /code/pre  with the piping of  precodels * /code/pre  I just can't figure out how to do it, any kind soul to help me with this please?  <answer142260> Figured it out.  It was as simple as replacing both words with code$(ls *)/code  So final command is:  precodeprintf "From: Sender Name &lt;sender@domain.com&gt;\nTo: recipient@domain.com\nSubject: $(ls *)\n\n$(ls *)\n" | /usr/sbin/sendmail -F "Sender Name" -f "sender@domain.com" "recipient@domain.com" /code/pre  <comment167624> You can use `\`ls *\`` or `$(ls *)`
