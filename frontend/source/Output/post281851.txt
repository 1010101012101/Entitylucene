iPhone Internet connection problem analysis on phone network <body> I have a similar "Internet unreachable" problem with 3 different versions of iOS: 8, 9 &amp; 10. Unfortunately I can't reproduce it. The same problem occurs with 2 different mobile phone operators.  Here are the common facts I was able to register on an iPhone 6 running iOS 9.3.1.  ol liMobile phone network is OK: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hXbXi.jpg" alt="no_Internet settings"/li liAll other possible Network connecions are off (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi)./li liAny web browser give an error message clearly stating the Internet is unreachable: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qE66g.jpg" alt="Safari_no_Internet"img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GsSXo.jpg" alt="Firefox_no_Internet"/li liAll other application using the Internet are endlessly looping without any clear error message./li /ol  It is clear that the iPhone either doesn't have a valid IP address or doesn't have a correct routing information to reach the Internet.  hr  In such a case how to diagnose clearly if the problem is a software failure coming from iOS or a failure coming from the mobile phone network?  <comment354787> Are you using a Global Proxy (usually setup though Apple Configurator or an MDM) or do you have a VPN? <comment354873> Not on this mobile phone network connection at the time of this problem. But I use a VPN at some other times. I will check if the problem might be caused by an abnormal exit from my VPN and add this information to my question.
