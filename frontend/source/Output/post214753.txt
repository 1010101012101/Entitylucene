El-Cap Mail app intermittent IMAP connection issues <body> The issues started occurring after upgrade to 10.11 but not sure if related or not.  I have 2 gmail accounts defined on my Mail app. Most of the time (around 70% or so) all is healthy.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zv074.png" alt="enter image description here"  But every few minutes, the alert signs show up next to both of the accounts. The connection doctor points the blame at IMAP  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Js2nS.png" alt="enter image description here"  This lasts for a while, usually a few minutes. I immediately check my internet connection by pinging various public IPs - all is rock solid. After a while this goes away.  Any idea why this may happen and how I can troubleshoot? I'm tending to not suspect an account setup issue as all works well most of the time. BTW - both of the accounts were set up very basic - just selected Gmail as the account type and added user and password. Did not mock around with anything else more advanced.  Thank you.  <answer238668> This problem is reported so often that it is likely there are multiple causes.  But after many months of putting up with emthis exact issue,/em here is what worked for me:  strongMail = Preferences = General = Check for new messages/strong  The default setting is strongAutomatically/strong  Change this to strongEvery 5 minutes/strong  I imagine anything will work except "Automatically".  My guess is that the Automatic option leaves a connection open to the imap server, and this is what gets screwed up.  I have not tested but it also possible the problem occurs because I click the manual download button while Mac Mail is set to Automatic download.  All I know is that this has been a continuing annoyance for a long time and with this change, it works.  <answer270849> After years of IMAP timeouts and related headaches, this solved it for me: a NVRAM / PRAM reset.
