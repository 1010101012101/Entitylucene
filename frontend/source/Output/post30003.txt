Where will the incident with the sudo command be reported to? <body> If a non-admin types a sudo command in Terminal, this will appear after they enter their password:  codeUser is not in the sudoers file. This incident will be reported./code  Where is this reported to?  <answer30004> The event will be logged in code/var/log/secure.log/code and a mail will be sent to root (which by default goes to code/dev/null/code which is Unix speak for it is discarded).  <answer111676>    In older versions of OS X (through 10.6 or maybe 10.7), the disallowed sudo attempt would be logged in code/var/log/secure.log/code; in more recent versions it's recorded in the ASL (Apple System Log) database, in code/var/log/asl/*/code. You can read this with the codeConsole.app/code utility (select codeALL MESSAGES/code in the sidebar, then if you can't find them use the search field in the upper right to search for codesudo/code). You can also use the command-line codesyslog/code command to query the database (codesyslog -k Facility authpriv -k Sender sudo/code should do it). Note that with either Console.app or codesyslog/code, the entries will only be visible if you are running as an admin or root.

It is possible to have it sent to a different user, but the chances of that modification are about the same as someone reading root's mail. <comment34417> +1 I've wondered this too! <comment34418> I had a look at the log file in the mean time, mail to root goes to /dev/null. <comment34459> Mandatory xkcd reference: http://xkcd.com/838/ <comment35185> It's always irritated me to no end that sudo is so crabby in responding to almost always perfectly innocent errors. <comment84368> /var/spool/mail/USERNAME  source: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13546933/where-are-sudo-incidents-reported <comment146737> While technically (probably) correct, this site focuses on OSX and iOS :-) <comment171257> *Who's* AppleID? There could be many AppleIDs associated with many users on one OS X machine. <comment171258> to the POLICE! hahahaha ;-) <comment171259> @patrix Maybe it's a Debain GNU/OS X ;-) <comment190303> @ Michael I do have Debian on my Mac Mini PPC! ;) <comment370147> "Note that with either Console.app or syslog, the entries will only be visible if you are running as an admin or root." @Braiam does that mean I could run the above command with `sudo` if I'm in the sudoers file? Like: `sudo syslog -k Facility authpriv -k Sender sudo` <comment370158> @AlexIxeras well, sudo makes you effectively root.
