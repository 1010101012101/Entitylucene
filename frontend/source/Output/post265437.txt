keyboard and trackpad stutter when waking from standby <body> When my MacBook wakes from standby the keyboard and trackpad start to stutter. This is a problem when entering a password, since some characters don't get typed and it becomes difficult to login.  After logging in the keyboard and trackpad work fine again. Another option is to shut down the MacBook and start it after that.  I am using macOS Sierra with FileVault enabled on a 2015 MacBook which I just reinstalled.
