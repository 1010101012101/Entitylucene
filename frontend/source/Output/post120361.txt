How to turn on Hardware Virtualization on Late 2013 MacBook Pro (for Windows 8.1 using Boot Camp)? <body> I am trying to turn on Hardware Virtualization for my new MacBook Pro for Windows 8.1 setup using Boot Camp.  I have searched online and I know that we can not just go to the BIOS like windows and change settings. Unfortunately, most of the solution I have come across are for Parallels or VMs.  Can anyone kindly let me know how to enable Hardware Virtualization on MBP for Windows 8.1 installed using Boot Camp?  <answer120379> There is no hardware virtualization to turn on or off like on Wintel PCs.  That switch and many other BIOS switches are there because (at least in part) the hardware manufacturers don't make the hardware AND software, like Apple does.  It is always on in any Mac that has a processor that supports virtualization. Pretty much any Mac in the last several years does so you are good to go with this one.  <answer122071> It sounds like you're running into the same issue I did, where after booting into Windows the VT-x shows as 'Disabled' in Task Manager.   Not sure how or why, but after going into   ul liOS X /li liSystem Preferences /li liTarget Disk /li liSelect the strongBOOTCAMP/strong disk as the startup disk/li /ul  Everything was well after that and I could happily use Hyper-V, even from a cold boot.   If I cold booted using the kbdOptions/kbd-key, and then selecting strongWindows/strong, VT-x was disabled in Task Manager.  Go figure. Could some Mac genius out there explain this one?  <answer163789> It seems that if you boot directly to Windows it doesn't work, but if you boot to OS X and switch to Windows, it works. Or you can boot to Windows, change to OS X and go back to Windows again.  <answer170848> I tried with and without holding alt key down, from Mac OS to Windows and the other way.  The Hyper-V installation begins and asks for a reboot, and during starting up of windows then 2nd step of the installation failed and rolled back.  Today I bought thunderbolt to Ethernet adapter, plugged it, installed Hyper-V and after reboot I could use it. Even when I unplug the adapter.  So it seams Hyper-V need some sort of Ethernet Adapter installed.  <answer226332> After I installed rEFInd to triple boot my MF839 Macbook (Win10, Ubuntu, OSX), to enable Virtualization on Windows 10, first I boot to OSX, then when it's login screen appear, I hit the restart button so the mac restart again then I choose Windows 10 from rEFInd.  <answer227177> I had tried all the various boot / reboot combinations and nothing worked until I added the Thunderbolt to Ethernet adaptor. The next time I started up the Windows Boot Camp partition I could enable Hyper V.   <answer234819> EDIT: I found a better way to get this working instead of the boot dance originally suggested (it's below for reference). Basically set codeenable_and_lock_vmx true/code in rEFInd and that's it. Details below ...  h1Suggested method/h1  ol liDisable macOS System Integrity Protection/SIP (Reboot Mac, hold down Command + R keys, at "OS X Utilities Utilities" pick "Terminal" menu item - type in terminal codecsrutil disable; reboot/code)/li liBack inside macOS after the reboot, get rEFInd and extract it anywhere (desktop, downloads etc)/li liOpen a terminal window, cd to where you extracted it and edit via codesudo nano refind/refind.conf-sample/code/li liUncomment codeenable_and_lock_vmx/code and set to codetrue/code i.e. the whole line should read codeenable_and_lock_vmx true/code. strong&lt;= This is what really fixes the issue!/strong/li listrong[optional]/strong While here, change the timeout to something quick, like 4 or 5 i.e. codetimeout 4/code/li liInstall rEFInd by running code./refind-install/code from terminal. The sample config you edited is used as the installed config./li listrong[optional]/strong Enable SIP again. Follow #1 above but run codecsrutil enable; reboot/code instead/li /ol  This method is very smooth - it works on normal as well as encrypted disks (FileVault2, VeraCrypt or BitLocker) and really takes a few minutes to install. Best of all, it works in every reboot.  h1Old method/h1  None of the other methods worked for me, especially since my Windows 10 was Bitlocker encrypted i.e. it doesn't show up in codeStartup Disks/code to chose to reboot to. The steps below work though  ol liPower off  Not just a hard reboot; strongfully powered off/strong; as in 'emcount to 10 when off/em' off/li liPower on and Boot to OS X desktop  This process loads virtualization properly. In my case, I had to hold codeoption/code and select OS X, enter my FileVault password (my OS X is encrypted) and then wait to boot into OS X desktop./li liReboot to Windows  Soft reboot via the Apple menu i.e. top left Apple icon = restart. During bootup select Windows/Bootcamp (via the option key). My Windows was Bitlocker encrypted, so I entered the disk password, booted to Windows, entered Windows password, landed on Windows 10 desktop. This time Hyper-V was present and functional!/li /ol  I'm putting this here for future reference but I hope Apple actually fixes their Bootcamp boot process. It's been broken for 8 years now and the above hackery is ridiculous for a $3000 machine and when Bootcamp is an officially supported Mac feature.  <comment140414> Oh ok. Thanks. My only concern was that Visual Studio told me that the hardware virtualization was off. <comment140447> Under task manager,  there should be an field telling you if virtualization is enabled. It's in full task manager,  under processor tab... <comment187421> do you meant Startup or Target Disk mode in the startup panel <comment192406> Mac "genius" will tell you you're using an unintended software with their hardware. Honest (something Apple should search for definition) answer would be - firmware bug which apple can't properly fix since 2008 (http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=821551). <comment251307> Or perhaps you have Hyper-V installed :( see here: http://superuser.com/questions/866962/why-does-virtualbox-only-have-32-bit-option-no-64-bit-option-on-windows-7 <comment287117> Wrong answer. `There is no hardware virtualization to turn on or off like on Wintel PCs.` is flat out wrong. Silicon features can be disabled via BIOS or UEFI - which is what's happening in Apple's broken bootcamp mode. <comment301981> The 'thunderbolt to ethernet adapter' trick for getting hyper-v to work does NOT work with an 2015 iMac + Windows 10. <comment301982> Which mac were you using? <comment310827> It was the Startup Disk for me. <comment315601> This worked for me.  1. boot into OS X and I ran ```docker run hello-world``` to ensure docker was working correctly. It was 2. Restart and hold the option key to bring up the option to book into Windows 3. Select Windows. I ran ```docker run hello-world``` to ensure docker was working correctly. It was. <comment316997> Thanks for your answer, I wasted nearly two hours before I found your answer. <comment319460> This is what worked for me.  It seems that the MacBook Pro needs to boot into OSX to enable virtualization.  After that, a soft restart into Windows will have virtualization enabled.  I have a mid-2015 15" MacBook Pro with i7 and Windows 10 Pro with Anniversary Update. <comment333555> This thread explains that you have to boot using the CSM-BIOS layer. https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6720461?tstart=0 ; In addition it also provides a command line to permanently fix this problem. First use `diskutil list` to work out Windows partition, then `sudo /usr/sbin/bless --device /dev/disk0s4 --setBoot --legacy --legacydrivehint /dev/disk0` <comment334003> I only know of cold-booting into WIN on my MAC by using the Options-key. When I instead boot to MAC first, how do I then switch to WIN on a BootCamp? <comment334004> On preferences, there is a boot disk section that allows you to choose a partition to boot <comment349990> This answer is 100% incorrect.  Macbook Bootcamp is broken and sometimes turns it off. <comment364706> PERFECT SOLUTION. Congrats 4 that. <comment371629> Chui Tey comment worked howewer It was needed to disable system integrity protection as described here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32932961/osx-10-11-el-capitan-setting-boot-device-property-not-working
