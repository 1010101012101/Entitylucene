Remap SHIFT + SPACE to underscore? <body> I'd like to remap the shift key (⇧) + space (␣) to underscore (code_/code)  I'd prefer to not have to install any third party tools if possible.  Similar question for windows  <answer220448> If you don't want to use a third party tool, you will face a similar problem as the OP in this question (DefaultKeyBinding.dict: Syntax error near unexpected token) that only applications which use the Cocoa text system will support this.   Additionally it appears that the kbdshift ⇧/kbd key can't be properly used as modifier key if kbdshift ⇧/kbd+kbdsome key/kbd doesn't have another representation than an unmodified kbdsome key/kbd - and kbdshift ⇧/kbd+kbdspace/kbd doesn't have one.  You may either create a emDefaultKeyBinding.dict/em or install emKarabiner/em and configure a custom keycode.  strongDefaultKeyBinding.dict/strong (only applications which use the Cocoa text system will support this)  Open Terminal and enter:  precodemkdir ~/Library/KeyBindings touch ~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict  /code/pre  Use codenano ~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict/code to add (using another shortcut like kbdcmd ⌘/kbdkbdctrl ^/kbdkbdspace/kbd here):  precode{     "@^ " = ("insertText:", "_"); } /code/pre  to output an underscore.  strongKarabiner/strong (all apps should support this)  ol liDownload, install and open Karabiner/li liOpen in the menulet Karabiner - Preferences/li liOpen the tab emMisc &amp; Uninstall/em/li liHit the button kbdOpen private.xml/kbd/li liOpen the file private.xml with an appropriate editor/li liEnter the customized keycode  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;     &lt;item&gt;         &lt;name&gt;Shift Space to Underscore&lt;/name&gt;         &lt;appendix&gt;(Change Shift-space to _)&lt;/appendix&gt;         &lt;identifier&gt;remap.shiftspace2underscore&lt;/identifier&gt;         &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::SPACE, MODIFIERFLAG_EITHER_LEFT_OR_RIGHT_SHIFT, KeyCode::MINUS, MODIFIERFLAG_EITHER_LEFT_OR_RIGHT_SHIFT,&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre/li liSave the file/li liOpen in the menulet Karabiner - Preferences the tab emChange Key/em/li liHit the ReloadXML button/li liEnable the remapping.
