Sharing and permission <body> How can I set sharing and permission on Mac os x to be -rwx for all? When I create file or folder it is emread and write/em for me but for all others it is emRead only/em. If there is more files just copied from USB to some unlocked folder, automatical it is emread only/em for all other users. Because we share files it is annoying. So please help.   <answer135091> Set your umask to 000 and reboot, then all files will save with full permissions for everyone. Here is the documentation http://support.apple.com/kb/ht2202  <comment114204> Please clarify. Do you mean other users on same computer? <comment114248> Assuming local shares try `chmod ugo+rwx name of file`. chmod can effect multiple files with options, check `man chmod` for more information.
