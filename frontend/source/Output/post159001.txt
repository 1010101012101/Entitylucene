Cannon iR C3380i Scanning Issue <body> We have a Canon iR C3380i Printer/Scanner/Fax/Copier machine in the office. I could install the Printer and Fax driver successfully on my MacBook Pro Retina 13" running on Yosemite.br but I'm having issues using the Scanner (Network scanner).br  On windows there was a software known as PaperPort which I could use for scanning but on Mac I'm totally lost (I'm totally new to Mac).br Could anyone help me how to use the scanner again on Mac? I have tried the canon website but I could only find the updated drivers for the printer.br  And I had no luck with googling...  <comment186899> Try using the Image Capture .app in your Application folder. <comment186901> It won't work I have tried that as it cannot find the device. the device is network based so I don't know how to install it. <comment186910> That is why is it important to disclose what have you tried, so we do not waist time.
