Making macOS Installer On an External LACIE Thunderbolt SSD <body> I have an emamazingly/em fast LACIE Rugged 1TB External Thunderbolt SSD and I want to create a small partition on that drive to use as an external installer for Mac OS Sierra instead of using a USB thumb drive which seems to be very slow.  strongOf course I know how to make a USB Installer - but I want to make an installer on an external thunderbolt drive./strong  I followed these instructions (but use the macOS Sierra installer instead) but when I booted my Retina 5K, 27-inch, Late 2015 iMac holding the option key, the only drive that appears in the startup disk list is the internal fusion drive of the iMac.  diskutil list returns:  precode   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                         24.0 GB    disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     314.6 MB   disk0s1    2:          Apple_CoreStorage Macintosh HD            23.6 GB    disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Boot OS X               134.2 MB   disk0s3  /dev/disk1 (internal, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk1    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk1s1    2:          Apple_CoreStorage Macintosh HD            999.3 GB   disk1s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk1s3  /dev/disk2 (internal, virtual):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD           +1.0 TB     disk2                                  Logical Volume on disk0s2, disk1s2                                  8FE6BC97-A4B2-4F86-BD58-7E491B4A0CF3                                  Unencrypted Fusion Drive  /dev/disk3 (external, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk3    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk3s1    2:                  Apple_HFS OS X Install ESD        999.9 GB   disk3s2 /code/pre  Can anyone help me determine how I can make this work?  <comment358546> The link to the instructions seems to have gotten lost somehow, can you add it? While you are doing that, can you please also add the output of `diskutil list`? <comment358550> Done just as requested. <comment358564> Sigh - not a duplicate - <comment358570> My question is specifically about WHY my THUNDERBOLT drive isn't being detected as a startup disk after restoring the installESD image onto the Thunderbolt drive's partition (Attempted with a single partition as above AND with a seperate 8GB partition). Drive also has USB3 support and the drive isn't detected with USB3 either! All the instructions on the supposed linked question do not seem to work on a Thunderbolt drive (it installs the installer without error, but the drive cannot be used as a startup disk when holding the opt key on startup and I cant figure out why or how to solve it!? <comment358573> I tried both of those. I will attempt 'createinstallmedia' again however, since the first time was part of a script. <comment358574> Grrrr s.o.b. Tried again using the 'createinstallmedia' method (manually) seems to be working properly. Aaaaggghhhh so frustrated but happy now. I guess if you want something done right you just have to do it yourself.  I sincerely apologise for my frustration and rudeness @klanomath <comment358575> @Ash I didn't want to insinuate that you don't know how to create a USB Installer. The linked question (and all similar questions) all contain *USB|thumb drive installer* though.  But the *createinstallmedia* method isn't restricted to USB/thumb drives. It should work for all kind of media and links (e.g Thunderbolt, FireWire, SD-Cards etc). You'd have to post the script and your command to launch it to get this secondary problem solved. <comment359107> Yeah I see that now, I thought it was restricted to the USB media.  Thank bro.
