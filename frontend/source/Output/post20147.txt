Alternative to musikcube on Mac OS X Lion <body> I like music to be played on the background and changing tracks by keyboard shortcut like in musikcube: http://www.musikcube.com/wiki/Preferences. Is there an alternative for musikcube on Mac OS X Lion ?  <answer20151> SizzlingKeys may be of help here.  <answer20152> I use CoverSutra - not free, but pretty cheap, and I like the ability to have the album cover displayed on the desktop.  <comment22357> There are so many apps to control iTunes via keyboard, it's almost an embarrassment of riches. Quicksilver, Launchbar, Butler .. to name but a few. This is nice and cheap though.
