3rd Monitor stopped working under Windows 7 Bootcamp <body> I used to be able to use all three (3) monitors for almost a whole year on my Mac Pro Mid 2012 tower model (that's before the Cylinder model came out).  Here's the configuration that was working before:  ul liWindows 7 Ultimate 64-bit (strongBootCamped/strong, not Virtualized/VM Ware/Parallel)/li liThe same Video Card that came with the system: strongATI Radeon HD 5700 Series/strong  ul liHas 1 DVI port, 2 Mini DisplayPorts./li /ul/li liThe displays are connected as follows:  ul listrongDisplay 1 (oriented normal/landscape):/strong Dell 1704FPT via DVI-to-DVI./li listrongDisplay 2 (oriented vertically/portrait flipped):/strong ASUS VS228 via DVI-Mini DP (active) adapter./li listrongDisplay 3 (oriented vertically/portrait flipped):/strong ASUS VS228 via DVI-Mini DP (active) adapter./li /ul/li /ul  But recently, one of the two ASUS VS228 monitors stays on standby (says "DVI NO SIGNAL"). In fact, the emweird/em thing is, I can plug the blank-monitor in the other Mini DP port (taking the working-monitor out temporarily) and the monitor is fine.  And the emeven weirder/em thing is, I verified the ports: If I restart with only the DVI monitor plugged into one of the Mini DP ports (either one), the monitor and the ports work.  Now I can't even get both ASUS monitors to get recognized on the system.  h2It displays "Generic Non-PnP Monitor" in the list:/h2  h2img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/T982s.png" alt="enter image description here"/h2  h2Here's the full view of the displays arrangement:/h2  h2img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Cy52N.png" alt="enter image description here"/h2  h2But even if I try to enable and pick "Extend desktop to this display" - a couple seconds after I apply my changes, I get this error:/h2  h2img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LijWl.png" alt="enter image description here"/h2  So I'm not sure if it's a driver issue, or if there's tiny "fuse boxes" on the Video Card that kicks off whenever it wants (just kidding), it just seems a bit sporadic that one morning it just decides that it can't run 3 monitors anymore.
