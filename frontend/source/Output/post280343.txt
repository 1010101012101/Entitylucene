Apple activation lock appeared randomly and iCloud password is forgotten <body> Asking this for a relative, but basically something very strange happened to her while on vacation. She had just arrived in the Cayman Islands off the plane and had no signal on her Verizon iPhone (4 I believe). In attempting to get online she tried to connect to one of those free wifi's that are in coffee shops and such. The phone warned that it was an unsecured connection but she had it connect anyway and it apparently went blackscreen and booted back up with the activation lock screen. This seems really weird to me but I did see someone else have something similar happen here: Activation lock when I&#39;m the only owner that my iPhone ever had, asking for my AppleID  Unfortunately, it appears she didn't write down her iCloud/iTunes password anywhere except for on the phone itself, which is now of course locked. She also tried resetting those passwords but of course that also requires access to the phone to do.   Next she apparently did the alternate way of resetting the password where you call and talk to apple and they told her they need purchase history.. The phone was bought 4 years ago at Target and while I'm sure they could find the credit card statement for the purchase, it likely says nothing about the iphone or the serial. I doubt they can find the actual receipt of purchase.  So I guess my question here is, is there any way out of this mess for her? She has had this phone for 4 years without any issue and now it seems to be a brick.. Additionally, all of her data appears to be lost as well. Not sure if it matters but on her PC at home the iTunes program is logged in and working too. I was hoping some type of identification like passport, ID, and credit card that is on the itunes account would suffice but reading online I'm not sure that will do it either.
