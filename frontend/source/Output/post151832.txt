Can't install matlab 2011a on Yosemite <body> I cannot install matlab 2011a student on yosemite. I click on the OSX installer, a matlab screen pops up then goes away.   Has anyone install 2011a on OSX Yosemite ?  <answer152034> No, you can't. MALAB R2014b is the only version that strongofficially/strong supports Yosemite. That said, I do have seen several workarounds that enable you to temporarily use the older-version MATLAB.  <answer154555> I post Gigon Bae recommendation from Mac website!
