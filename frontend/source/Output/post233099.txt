Fix horizon line in Photos (as in iPhotos) <body> I recall that it was possible with iPhoto to rotate an image by a small amount, just a few degrees, to rectify the orientation of an image. This is useful to make sure that pictures taken at, say, the seashore have a truly horizontal horizon.  This feature seems to have disappeared in Photos. Is it available within any other tool on El Capitan? Is it hiding somewhere within Photos?  <answer233170> The edit tools are a little bit hidden, but actually easy to get to, once you know how.    Choose your photo, double click to see it in single view, then just hit kbd Return ‚èé /kbd &amp; it will switch to edit mode. It's also in the Image Menu.  Rotate is unexpectedly strongnot/strong where to find the control, instead it's under Crop, highlighted on the right in this picture...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z04Z5.png" alt="enter image description here"
