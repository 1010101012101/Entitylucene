bash autocompletion scripts in OS X <body> Here is what I learned so far:  precode# settings on mac if [[ $(uname) == "Darwin" ]]; then     # enable bash completion     if [ -f `brew --prefix`/etc/bash_completion ]; then             . `brew --prefix`/etc/bash_completion     fi     # enable git completion     if [ -f `brew --prefix`/etc/bash_completion.d/git-completion.bash ]; then     . `brew --prefix`/etc/bash_completion.d/git-completion.bash     fi fi /code/pre  What if I have multiple scripts in  code`brew --prefix`/etc/bash_completion.d//code? How can I enable all of them?  Or, is there a folder in OS X equivalent to code/etc/bash_completion.d//code in linux?  <comment209527> The file, `bash_completion` that you're sourcing handles the sourcing of the individual files from the `bash_completion.d` directory.
