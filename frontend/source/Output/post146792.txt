Freeze after "VM Swap Subsystem is ON" <body> My Macbook pro 15" (early 2012) froze and I had to force restart it. But it freezes in startup too.  I noticed that it stops after "VM Swap Subsystem is ON" line in verbose mode.  Is there any solutions for this?  How can I recover my OS X?  I didn't install or modified anything in the last few days.    <answer149136> Just to say what was the issue.  Logic board was dead and needed to be replaced. (hopefully I had 10 days of warranty left hehe)
