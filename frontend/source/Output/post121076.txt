OS X: is there any (area selection) screenshot tool that can upload to Imgur? <body> On Windows, I was spoilt by the fantastic Greenshot, a superb (and free) screenshot tool that had among its many features, uploading to Imgur.com.  I currently use CloudApp but I've reached my 'limit' for uploads and I don't feel like paying for their Pro service when there's myriad of free (and better) image hosting services like Imgur etc.  So are there any screenshot apps which can plug into Imgur?  <answer121078> I've done a bit of searching in the past for the same thing and didn't really find anything. Although this doesn't upload directly to Imgur, it's not very time consuming.   hr  strongStep One:/strong Take a screenshot of an area with the keyboard shortcut strongCommand (âŒ˜)-Shift-4/strong img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Jn3PW.png" alt="Example of screen shot with shortcut."  emEnd result should be something like this./em  hr  strongStep Two:/strong Just upload it to Imgur. http://imgur.com  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uXJlO.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  List of other keyboard screenshot shortcuts.  <comment141105> I really am looking for an app that does it in one hotkey, as indicated in the question. I'm currently trying out Captured though, a low-priced app in the Mac App Store. Also Slingshot might do the job but I'm not sure if it can do area selection or not. Captured seems to have a (del-breaking) bug for me right now so I'm very disappointed in it. <comment141106> I made the switch to LightShot a while back. Although it doesn't upload to Imgur it does the job for me. It seems like exactly what your looking for except the Imgur part. http://app.prntscr.com
