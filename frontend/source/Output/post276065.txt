iPhone has no drivers in Windows 10 <body> I can't browse my iphone 5 (10.2.1) in windows 10 explorer, it doesn't show up as a volume.   ul liThe iphone is listed in the device manager, with a warning that it has no installed drivers./li liWindows cannot find any drivers online ("iPhone has no driver"), nor in Apple's common program files (codeC:\Program Files\Common Files\Apple\Mobile Device Support/code). /li liI've uninstalled and reinstalled itunes, and the Apple mobile device USB drivers, as a precaution. Iphone is still listed as driverless in device manager./li liI've installed the stand-alone Windows update (KB3099229_x64) containing media features that were excluded in my version of Windows 10 Pro N./li liI've unlocked my device./li liI've trusted the computer./li liI've rebooted the device./li liI've used three different USB ports./li liWindows and iphone is updated./li liItunes can interface with the device with no problems./li listrongUpdate:/strong There are no hardware problems. Everything works on a Windows 7 computer. /li /ul  So, why don't there exist any drivers for iphone 5 for Windows 10? Seems like a rather huge oversight.  <answer276075> You should try iExplorer for macOS and Windows. At $40 it is a bit pricy, but it is a virtual Swiss Army knife of an app for iOS devices. Worth every penny.  (Disclaimer: I'm a very satisfied user of iExplorer for macOS. No financial ties between me and Macroplant LLC.)  <comment347384> Why do you need this? <comment347387> @Mark To access photos as a USB camera <comment347395> What OS is on the iPhone 5? (+1 for the detailed list of things you have tried. Hopefully there's a solution other than use iCloud or another sync method. Even if it's an open source library and bash/unix support on Windows) <comment347419> @bmike I updated the question (iOS 10.2.1). I have a hard time even figuring out if it's the cable's fault; iTunes can play back music from the phone and list all contents on it, Ubuntu can mount it (but lists no content â€” not sure if that is a definite sign of hardware error), it charges the battery ok, and the device is visible to Windows device manager... <comment347458> $40 sounds like current market value for my phone <comment347490> Macroplant has a free demo trial, I believe. Download it and see if it does what you need. <comment347664> Thanks. I might check it out if I need a workaround, but the same moment I accept not having drivers for the iPhone is the moment I no longer use iPhone :-) <comment347667> Take a look at [this page](https://www.copytrans.net/blog/solved-computer-and-itunes-not-recognizing-iphone-all-you-need-to-know-to-get-it-fixed/) I found in the Google universe. :-) Perhaps there is something you haven't tried yet. The site has an available app that downloads just the Windows  iOS drivers. <comment350119> Thanks. I tried it all -- no luck.
