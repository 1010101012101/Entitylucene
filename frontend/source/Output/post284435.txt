Air Drop not working <body> Yesterday I wanted to share some photos with my friend so I decided to use Air Drop instead of bluetooth. After some attempts I couldn't find his device, I tried to restart my Iphone and I made me visible for everyone not only my phone contacts but nothing works. Do you know what is happening? Do I have to send my phone to Apple assistance?  <comment358678> Did you follow _all_ of the directions [in this Apple Support Document](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204144)? Please edit your answer to indicate what you tried to do, but failed, to get this working. You only state that is is not working: that's not enough to go by. <comment358679> Thanks a lot i discovered that i hadn't Wi-Fi turned on so obviusly i couldn't share my photo. Sorry for wasting your time, thanks <comment358681> I wasted none of my time, Matteo Mian. Just trying to help. :-) <comment358687> Please add this as an answer to your question so you can accept it.
