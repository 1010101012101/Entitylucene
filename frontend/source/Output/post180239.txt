How to set a screen resolution other than what is displayed in the scaled list? <body> I need to set my screen resolution 1280x720 (this is a requirement for a screencast I need to create).  When I go into the Display - Scaled menu this is no longer available as an option on Yosemite, even though it was available on previous versions of the OS on the same laptop.  Is there a way in Yosemite to access or force different screen resolutions for this?  <answer180253> You can install John Ford's screenresolution utility via codebrew install screenresolution/code. Alternatively you can download and compile the source here.  Once the utility is installed you can see emall/em available resolutions via codescreenresolution list/code. Assuming the appropriate resolution is listed you can set you display with something like codescreenresolution set 1280x720x32/code.  <comment214043> Q-This is a tool that can be used to determine current resolution, list available resolutions and set resolutions for active displays on Mac OS 10.6, and possibly above.  I have only tested 10.6.
