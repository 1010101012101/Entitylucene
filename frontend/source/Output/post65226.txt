Improve VLC quality on WMV, AVI etc? <body> OKay I've noticed that when I play an WMV on my Mac using VLC player the quality is terrible in comparison when i play it on Windows  I have tried "unchecking skip frames" on VLC, but no change at all  Anyone have any idea how to fix this on VLC?   Thanks  <answer65236> More a sidestep than a workaround but have you considering using Flip4Mac to play WMV's in Quicktime rather than use VLC?  if you can lose the extra functionality you get from VLC, the playback is much better.
