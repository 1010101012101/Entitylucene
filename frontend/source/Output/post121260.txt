"Updates are ready to install" but I couldn't install <body> My company had given me an iMac to use and apps like iMovie, iPhoto had been installed by a former employee who had been using this iMac before me. Now the problem is; Updates are available for those apps, but I could not install updates of those apps because OS asks for password of that person's Apple ID. OS daily prompts me about updates but i can't install updates as well as stop notifications to prompt.   I seriously don't like these notifications and can't find a way to stop them.  I need either of the following possible solutions:  ul liNo more "update" notifications./li liChange Apple ID of those apps./li /ul  Is there a way to achieve any??   BTW I m using OS X Mavericks 10.9.1  <answer121271> See this answers to your questions:  Also to take full ownership of the computer:  Make a user account with administrative privileges, and disable the other account (the previous owner)  <comment141335> I don't think that changing the settings in the iTunes store (your second option) will change the behaviour of the Mac App Store.
