iPhone 5 Contacts Underline <body> I've recently had all the info in my Contacts underlined (not the name but phone numbers, addresses, etc.). I hate the look (makes it look busy and it's unnecessary), but have no idea how this occurred. I'm still using the older OS (not 8). Anybody know what I should do to get rid of the underlining? Thanks.  <answer222037> To disable Button Shapes, which may be the reason you are seeing lines under certain text, tap Settings  General  Accessibility, and turn off Button Shapes if it is on.  <comment200380> Can you post a screenshot?
