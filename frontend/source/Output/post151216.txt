Can't answer my phone call with yosemite <body> Whenever a phone call comes in I can answer it on my iPad but not on my macbook(2008) running yosemite.  I also can't call my contacts from my contact list.  Any thoughts on this?  <answer151230> I haven't found a definitive list of compatible machines yet, but based on reviews I would say your Macbook is too old to support it.    Several sites are claiming that it works on a 2012 model but not 2011.  <answer151231> Handoff only works with fairly recent Macs that support Bluetooth 4.0.  You can check whether Handoff is supported in About this Mac - System Report...  My 2011 Macbook Pro doesn't have Bluetooth 4.0, so no Handoff for me either.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SnAU8.png" alt="Screenshot of relevant Bluetooth values for Handoff"
