Is there any reason to NOT use a disk image for a new MacBookPro with TouchBar? <body> I just got a new MacBookPro with the Touch Bar (15" model) that is running macOS 10.12.1  I am currently using a 15" MacBook Pro 11,3 running macOS 10.12.1 with FileVault running.  Typically I would   ol liCreate a SuperDuper! clone of my current hard drive on an external usb drive/li liBoot the new laptop to the external USB Drive/li liUse SuperDuper! to clone the external USB drive to the new laptop's hard drive/li liRestart the new laptop without the USB drive.../li /ol  That process has always duplicated my laptop nicely.  I'm never liked Migration Assistant and I've got lots of things installed via HomeBrew, etc that this saves me from having to reinstall.  With the new laptop there is the TouchBar and the fingerprint scanner that my old machine didn't have.  Is there any reason not to do my typical process to move to this new laptop?  <comment329431> Check the product build version on both system with `grep ProductBuildVersion -A 1 /System/Library/CoreServices/SystemVersion.plist`. If they are identical it shouldn't be a problem. But sometimes - though the product versions are identical (i.e 10.12.1) - the build versions differ which may indicate a special version for the newly released Mac containing additional drivers/fixes not included in the older build version.
