Problems with localhost after Sierra update <body> I have followed these instructions to set up a web server with a sites folder on my macbook. This always worked well but now I have two problems:  ol listrongLocalhost forbidden/strong  If I go to localhost, I get the message '403 Forbidden'. This used to display the 'It Works!' page./li listrongSites folder redirects to localhost/strong  If a file in the code~user/sites/code folder does not exist, for example: codehttp://localhost/~user/mysite/favicon.ico/code then the browser is redirected to codehttp://localhost/favicon.ico/code  This file is not found and again I get the error:  strong403 permission denied/strong/li /ol  What setting causes the redirect from codelocalhost/~user/sites/code to codelocalhost/code?   Why is localhost forbidden? I used to get the 'It Works!' page.  hr  The steps I followed are:  precodesudo apachectl start /code/pre  This should display the 'it works' page from /Library/Webserver/Documents, but instead it displays 'Forbidden'.  I added a 'username.conf' file in /etc/apache2/users/. This file contains:  precode&lt;Directory "/Users/username/Sites/"&gt; AllowOverride All Options Indexes MultiViews FollowSymLinks Require all granted &lt;/Directory&gt; /code/pre  I fixed the permissions of username.conf with:  precodesudo chmod 644 username.conf /code/pre  Then I opened /etc/apache2/httpd.conf and uncommented the lines:  precodeLoadModule authz_core_module libexec/apache2/mod_authz_core.so LoadModule authz_host_module libexec/apache2/mod_authz_host.so LoadModule userdir_module libexec/apache2/mod_userdir.so LoadModule include_module libexec/apache2/mod_include.so LoadModule rewrite_module libexec/apache2/mod_rewrite.so LoadModule php5_module libexec/apache2/libphp5.so Include /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-userdir.conf /code/pre  And finally I opened /etc/apache2/extra/httpd-userdir.conf and uncommented:  precodeInclude /private/etc/apache2/users/*.conf /code/pre  After restarting apache with  precodesudo apachectl restart /code/pre  I get the errors as described above.  <comment337365> OK, I have edited the question with all the steps I have taken. <comment337378> What happens when you ping localhost? <comment337440> That seems to work: 64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.043 ms <comment337445> That means localhost is OK.  Now, did you change the username within /etc/apache2/users/username.conf file to match your actual Mac username? Looks like Directory "/Users/username/Sites/" line is not changed according to your actual username. <comment337557> I did add my actual username. The 'user/sites' folder works. Only the generic localhost is not allowed. <comment337899> OK, I found the error after lots of headaches. I edited the files in Library/WebServer/Documents as myself, this changed the owner of the files. That made the files inaccessible! Using chown root on the files and folders fixed the problem.
