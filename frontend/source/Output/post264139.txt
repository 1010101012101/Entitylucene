"System" is taking up the majority of my Drive <body> Earlier I moved some folders (~5 gb of stuff) around.  From Dropbox into Google Drive.  Then I moved some stuff from Google Drive to my Desktop with Icloud Drive enabled.    Anyway, this set off 100% cpu processes for like 6 hours.  So I decided to turn iCloud Drive off, and just keep the folders in Google Drive (which now says its done syncing).  Well, somehow this whole ordeal has finished and now I'm in a situation where my "System" has ~85 GB of stuff.  Now, it has routinely had &lt; 30Gb.  Somehow all these cloud systems have messed with my computer and now its in this state.  I have no idea how to approach this.  I've seen deleted the dropbox app.    What is going on?img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/85ElR.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment330987> Those are cache files. Use a disk inventory program to find out exactly what those data hogs are and then Google whether or not you can delete them safely. <comment331075> The "System" category isn't addressed by this dic inventory programs.  I used "Disc Inventory X" and it only shows things like applications, documents, etc..  This is like 25-35gb thats fine.  But I have 80 GB!! in system and its totally opaque to me.
