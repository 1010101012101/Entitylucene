Moving server Share Points to a new drive in Mac OS X Server 10.8 <body> How do I move a Share Point under Mac OS X 10.8 so that it points to a folder on a different volume?  I have currently have 8 Share Points located on an old external RAID. I am upgrading to a new RAID. I have copied my files over to the new RAID. Now I need to tell Mac OS X Server that the Share Points should use folders found on the new RAID. I don't see any way of re-targeting the Share Points.   I seem to remember that older versions of OS X Server, allowed you to so re-target the Share Point to a different folder. Clients would be disconnected and have to reconnect to the server, but would not notice any change.   <answer188541> Its still possible, see OS X Server: Changing the service data storage location :     In OS X Server (Mountain Lion) and Lion Server v10.7.2 or later, you can store service data in a location other than your startup volume.      To change the service data storage volume:      ul   liOpen Server app, and connect to the desired server./li   liSelect the name of the server in the column on the left under the heading Server (on OS X Mountain Lion) or Hardware (on OS X Lion)./li   liClick the Settings tab./li   liClick the Editâ€¦ button on the "Service Data" line./li   liSelect a volume./li   /ul
