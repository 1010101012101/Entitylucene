Trackpad and Keyboard work on login screen, but sometimes don't after login <body> For some time (I'm on macOS Sierra right now, but I've got the problem at least since Yosemite), my MacBook Pro Mid 2010 acts weird. Even though keyboard/trackpad emalways/em work up until the login screen, sometimes they (always both) stop working emafter/em login. Luckily, the on/off switch still works, and a cold reboot usually solves the problem (sometimes it takes several reboots).  What causes this? If it's a "hardware" issue, how come the keyboard always works until the login screen, and how come that it only appears sometimes, and can be solved via (a sufficient number of) reboots?  P.S.: I've tried resetting the PRAM and the SMC, but that doesn't seem to help one bit.   <comment372250> Have you tried using an external mouse/keyboard, and seeing if it does the same thing? That will help you determine if this is a hardware issue or not. <comment372389> Also try a different account and check if FileVault is on as it uses a special EFI login rather than macOS <comment372635> If I plugin a USB mouse or keyboard, it will always work even if the internal won't work. I do have FileVault enabled on it, but this issue was there even before I enabled it. I will try logging into the guest account and see whether I can reproduce the error with it.
