How can I open a URL on connecting to a specific wifi network in OS X? <body> Some wifi networks require logging in through a browser after connecting, in order to gain internet access. In many cases it is possible to log in by opening a specific URL without having to click through the login page. Can I make this happen automatically when I connect to a specific wifi network?  <comment130329> Do you know the "direct" URL for this specific network? <comment130330> Yes. E.g. for Starbucks I want to open https://www.btopenzone.com:8443/freeToEndUserLogon <comment130331> Bookmark it and just click on the bookmark?
