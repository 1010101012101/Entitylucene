Use numkeypad to move caret <body> I'm really used to move editors caret with numpad. From it I can move to the end-beginning of a line, I can go page up &amp; page down and of course move the caret in text editor up,down, left and right. Is there anyway to accomplish this on mac? Using the arrow keys to move is hell slow for me.  Cheers.  <comment195829> You know you can add modifiers to jump faster, Opt/right=one word, Cmd/right=end of line; Opt/up=one line up, Cmd/up=beginning... etc. <comment195830> Yes I know. But As I commented I'm used to use the numpad as I stated before. I have been using it this way for more than 20 years. It is really difficult to change mind now :). When I said it is slow it is not because there aren't other ways to move to end of lines, etc... but my brain always want to do it as it is used to so, I ended pressing 3 keys, the old key my brain knows, delete key, the correct key on mac :). I'm trying ukele but don't really know how to make the layout of keymap change if numpad is on and off. <comment195831> Mac doesn't have a NumLock switch on full-sized keyboards, like Windows. You can make them into 'mouse-keys' but not cursor keys <comment195859> So, It is not possible to do what I want with osx :(. What a pity.
