iMac Target display mode displays nothing with Mac Mini <body> I have an iMac (Late 2013) and a Mac Mini (Late 2014) both running macOS 10.12.1. I connected the Mac Mini to the iMac and pressed command+F2 on the iMac keyboard. The iMac detected the Mac Mini and go into target display mode. But no image is displayed on the screen. Remote Desktop from the iMac and the Mini do work just fine.   I tried this with another cable and different port, still the same. Rebooting the Mac Mini and the iMac also does not help. I plugged the Mac Mini to both Mini-DisplayPort and HDMI display, the display lights up with image so it definitely not a faulty port. What should I do next?  P.S. I did manage to share files between the iMac and the Mac Mini with the Thunderbolt cable just fine.
