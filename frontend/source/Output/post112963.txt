How do I deactivate my microphone and iSight for security reasons? <body> In OS X 10.8 it is possible to log in via SSH and get access to hardware input devices like microphone and iSight camera. Thus it is possible to remotely record audio and video of other users sitting in front of the machine. I consider this a strongsevere security issue/strong!  h3How to exploit this issue/h3  Luckily, I didn't have to face a microphone exploit yet, but this question on Stack Overflow shows a little python script which enables you to capture pictures using the iSight camera from the command line. I don't think it is much harder to capture video.  h3Question/h3  One can disable the microphone using  precodesudo kextunload /System/Library/Extensions/AppleHDA.kext /code/pre  …unfortunately this also disables all audio output.  The same applies for the iSight camera by unloading codeIOUSB.kext/code, which most certainly might break all devices connected via USB, if not even causes a kernel panic.  How can I disable the microphone and iSight camera in an iMac (late-2012) under OS X 10.8.5 without breaking other system services?  <answer112975> I think you can specifically target your iSight camera by (re)moving code/System/Library/QuickTime/QuickTimeUSBVDCDigitizer.component/code  According to this: http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20070323094959262  The link does mention that it is 10.4 specific and I haven't tried it under 10.8/10.9 but it's a good place to start.  <answer112981> To disable iSight and other cameras, use:  precodesudo kextunload /System/Library/Extensions/AppleCameraInterface.kext /code/pre  (tested on 10.9)  I'm not aware of a way to disable audio input without affecting output. It's the same hardware so unloading/removing the kext probably won't work. One step you can take is to turn the input volume down to zero in your sound preferences, but of course anyone who's able to log in will be able to turn it back up.  <answer235199> Unfortunately removing the Digitizer component only disables Quicktime access to the camera. Command line utilities can still gain access. Your best move is to paint over the camera lens. That is what I did.  I also painted over the microphone holes.  <answer247603> You want to check out isight-cli, which basically changes the permissions on the necessary drivers as suggested here and here.  isight-cli is based on original applescript isight-disabler.  <answer250109> h1An update for OSX 10.11.6/h1  h2Enable/disable the camera/h2  ol liFirst of all, you need to disable SIP by rebooting your mac in recovery mode (hold "Alt" key while rebooting then open the term.app and run codecsrutil disable/code and finally reboot)./li liI'm not a huge fan of file deletion in sytem folder.

To be continued...  <comment132605> I think "severe security issue" is an overreaction. If someone is logged into the computer, it's generally assumed that they're allowed to access the computer. I know Linux can be configured to deny remote users access to some hardware but it's uncommon and I'm not sure if it even extends to webcams. <comment137680> Is it possible to reenable the camera when it´s deactivated once? Tried it by using "kextload", doesn´t work. <comment315816> Does this work with macOS Sierra?
