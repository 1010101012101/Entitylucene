Disable Waiting for Activation Popup <body> After my phone reboots a popup appears "Waiting for Activation This may take some time." How can I disable this? I'm using a deactivated SIM card. I would like the card to remain deactivated. This is on an iPhone 5S and iPhone6.  <answer205050> Take out the SIM card, this should fix it. If it's not activated, you shouldn't need it anyways ;) I've often used iPhones without an activated SIM card, and after taking these out, the pop ups stopped ;)  <answer212672> I faced this problem before. You can try to use this trick:  ol liGo to Settings ~ Message and Turn Off iMessage + Facetime./li liTurn on the Airplane Mode./li liTurn on Wi-Fi./li liTurn on iMessage like the first step. The system will ask you for your Apple ID If it is not added yet./li liTurn Off the Air Plane Mode./li liiMessage should work properly now./li /ol  Source.  <answer294674> Just take out the SIM card.  I have an iPhone 5c and it got really annoying having the "Your iPhone is not activated" message every 10 minutes. I took out my SIM card with a needle (because the iPhone 5c is different than other phones).  I haven't seen the message since.
