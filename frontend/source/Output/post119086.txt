Universal path in Terminal <body> I'm writing an AppleScript that will allow me to copy the Time Machine folder from an external drive and paste it onto the user's desktop of their Mac. The reason I'm doing this is because when a time machine backup isn't working as it should, we have to manually move it. Well, I'd like to make this process easier for people and just create a script to do it.  tl;dr problem: How do I make a variable location?  Ex: /Volumes/Time\ Machine/Backups.backupdb///Users    The X and Y are going to be different for everyone's Mac. People have different names for their macs and Hard Drives. How could I make a universal location? Thanks!  <answer119112> You can use the code~/code shortcut or code$HOME/code variable, both of which refer to the User's home directory. You can try this out in Terminal by running codecd ~/code or codecd $HOME/code, which will take you to your home directory. You can verify by running codepwd/code, which should output code/Users//code followed by your username.  For the Desktop, you would use code~/Desktop/code or code$HOME/Desktop/code.  <answer119127> You can get the machine name with codescutil --get ComputerName/code and the name of the boot volume with   precodebasename "`find -x /Volumes/ -type l`" /code/pre  Note that both of these may well return a string containing spaces. So you want to do this  precodeCOMPUTER="`scutil --get ComputerName`" VOLUME="`basename \"\`find -x /Volumes/ -type l\`\"" /code/pre  then  precodeTIMEPATH="/Volumes/Time Machine/Backups.backupdb/$COMPUTER/$VOLUME/Users" /code/pre
