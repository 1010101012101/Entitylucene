I cannot find my backup on my TimeMachine <body> My time machine is set up by connecting an external harddisk to a AirPort Extreme.  I am trying the 'Internet Recovery' option to restore my iMac from my time machine backup. When the 'OS X Utitlies' appear I picked the 'Restore Your System' option. It prompted me for my login and password of the TimeMachine.   I provided the details. The app show me an icon of 'Seagate Time Machine'. I selected it and I can only find an old MacBookPro backup.  However I connect to the Airport Extreme in Finder, I can actually see this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BGj8i.png" alt="enter image description here"  My imac's backup is apparently in the 'imac' folder.  I think it is because the internet recovery is of version 10.7 (Lion) and my TimeMachine is made after my iMac is upgraded to 10.9.  How can I get the 'Restore Your System' app to look into the 'imac' folder instead of 'Seagate Time Machine'?
