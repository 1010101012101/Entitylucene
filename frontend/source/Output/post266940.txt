I have rEFInd installed, but it's not working <body> I've followed the directions to the KEY. I've done it both manual, and using the script by disabling, and re-enabling SIP. It said success. I used the The rEFInd Boot Manager: Installing rEFInd help guide to do both of the techniques. This is on my macOS btw, and I have Windows 10 on Boot Camp already. I'm looking to triple boot it with Kali Linux on my MacBook Pro.  So, when I restart my computer I can tell something is happening because instead of being brought to an OS immediately, it just shows a blank black screen. Nothing happens until I shut it out, and restart it again and hold down the Option key - or if push "Command + Option + P + R". The later disables rEFInd it looks like?  I've tried to look it up somewhere to see if I can get a fix, but I wasn't able to find anything that helped me after trying a few things.
