How to simulate 2-finger tap with keyboard modifier? <body> Chrome has introduced a new feature requiring a weird 2-finger tap gesture on a particular button. It's an awkward gesture and difficult to time it right.  Is there any way to make ctrl-tap act as if two fingers had been pressed on the trackpad? Or some other solution that would avoid the need to use 2-finger tap for this.  <answer197101> BetterTouchTool is a great app that can help you with this.  You can install this by going into their website and download or by installing it with codehomebrew cask/code here  Now just for an example, I've posted an image of something you could do with it img src="https://puu.sh/j9McA/ed36aea079.png" alt="better touch tool"  <comment235909> Good tool - thanks. Only downside is it doesn't support ctrl-click anywhere. The gesture dropdown requires a specific position like top-left. So the best choice was just to use a corner with no modifier (ie no ctrl, just tap the corner).
