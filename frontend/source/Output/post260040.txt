Apple Watch Updated Time Zone Settings <body> Recently time zone was changed in Turkey. It was UTC + 2, now opting out of DST, time zone is permanently UTC + 3. All iOS devices updated correctly.   However, on my Apple Watch, it asked for 'There is an updated Time Zone Settings, click OK to apply' or similar and I accidentally said no. Now it shows the wrong time.   How can apply the updated time zone settings?  I have tried restarting, updating to watchOS 3.0.1, airplane mode on/off, nothing seems to be working.  Any ideas?  <answer260172> On your iPhone, go to settings, general, date/time. Disable auto time zone and switch to another time zone. Then switch back to your own time zone (maybe wait a bit for the watch to pick up the change?). It will ask you again.  <comment325506> On your iPhone, go to settings, general, date/time.
