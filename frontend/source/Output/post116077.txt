Where are ssh login attempts logged to on jailbroken iPhone with OpenSSH? <body> I know in Ubuntu they are in /var/log/auth.log but I can't find where they are logged on the iPhone. Ive made sure logging is enabled and have looked in /var/log and /var/logs as well as pretty much everywhere. Still cant find where the attempts are being logged.  <answer129367> I just found the answer to this  you have to manually edit code/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.openssh.sshd.plist/code  change this part:  precode&lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt; &lt;array&gt;     &lt;string&gt;/usr/sbin/sshd&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;string&gt;-i&lt;/string&gt; &lt;/array&gt; /code/pre  to this:  precode&lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt; &lt;array&gt;     &lt;string&gt;/usr/sbin/sshd&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;string&gt;-E /var/log/auth.log -i&lt;/string&gt; &lt;/array&gt; /code/pre  then reboot or restart sshd  <comment135974> I've looked everywhere, and I can't find any log file for `sshd`. <comment135987> Same here. It seems as if maybe there isn't a log... <comment151423> Nice! I sold my iPhone so I chalked it up as a lost cause, but still this is very useful.
