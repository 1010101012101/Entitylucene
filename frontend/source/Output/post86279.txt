Configuration, Mac-Mini, OSX 10.7.4 + Xcode v.4.5 + iOS 6.0   <comment99601> Are you using any Source Control? <comment99603> No, I am not using! <comment99605> How big is your project? <comment99606> Its around 46MB <comment99607> Um, How many actual source code files? <comment99612> I've ten of view controllers + some custom classes <comment99666> That looks like a Git identifier. Did you check "Automatically create git repository" when creating the project? <comment99758> @Linuxios, Manually I've not checked that, but if its checked by default.
