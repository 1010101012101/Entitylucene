Can’t install scikit-learn for python on Mac - wrong directory <body> I’m tearing my hair out! (Not much left!) When I run easy_install -U scikit-learn as admin I get the following error:  Admin$ easy_install -U scikit-learn  strongerror: can't create or remove files in install directory The following error occurred while trying to add or remove files in the installation directory:     [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/test-easy-install-42472.pth' The installation directory you specified (via --install-dir, --prefix, or the distutils default setting) was:     /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/ Perhaps your account does not have write access to this directory?  If the installation directory is a system-owned directory, you may need to sign in as the administrator or "root" account.  If you do not have administrative access to this machine, you may wish to choose a different installation directory, preferably one that is listed in your PYTHONPATH environment variable./strong  here is my system info:   Running Yosemite 10.10.5 Python 2.7 “which python” yields /usr/bin/python  “which easy_install” yields /usr/bin/easy_install  I’ve tried everything and haven’t seen any good answers to this on various forums. If anyone can help, I’d really appreciate it!!!  <answer226021> You can check and see who owns the codesite-packages/code directory by using   precodels -l /Library/Python/2.7/ /code/pre  You'll get results similar to this:  precodetotal 0 drwxr-xr-x  3 root  wheel  102 Jan 13 17:58 site-packages /code/pre  The third column (that shows coderoot/code above), shows the directory owner. In the above example, this directory is owned by root. I've seen similar errors related to this. I know that you stated you are running these commands as Admin, but prepending these install commands with sudo has worked for me, however, it will install the package globally:  precodesudo easy_install -U scikit-learn /code/pre  <comment274383> Wow! That was too simple! Using sudo command above as you suggested fixed the install problem. I did get about 36 warnings, but so far its working.  Thanks Chaz!
