Unable to add folders to Dock <body> Strangely, all folders (only codeDownloads/code in my case) have vanished form my dock. A reboot did not help. I can still drag apps onto it, but not directories.  How can I find out what the problem is and maybe fix it? Is there some configuration code.plist/code to which I could manually add stuff?  The system is 10.12.3 on an MBP 9,2.  <answer273903> I restored code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dock.plist/code and code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dock.extra.plist/code from Time Machine and codekillall/codeed codeDock/code and now it works. I suspect the first file is the only relevant one since it contains an entry for the directory.
