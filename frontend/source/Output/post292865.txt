Accessibility: how to bring up the Item Chooser? <body> Apple has a help page that documents the Item Chooser; an accessibility utility that lets you navigate a webpage on a Mac in Safari (and apps too, I think) by choosing a web page's interactable items from a menu instead of clicking with the mouse:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vc9nJ.png" alt="enter image description here"  I can't seem to get this Item Chooser panel to appear. I have Voice Over enabled and am seemingly triggering the Item Chooser successfully by clicking VO-I on the keyboard (as is described on the help page). I get a message indicating that I'm doing things correctly…  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iOWN1.png" alt="enter image description here"  …but no Item Chooser ever appears. What am I doing wrong here?  To add some context: I'm a web developer exploring options for improving the accessibility of some of my websites. I watched an accessibility demo where the presenter was using Voice Over on Safari to navigate a page. He brought up the Item Chooser panel that highlighted all of the items on screen (like aria landmarks, links, H1, H2, H3, etc).
