Data detector for Safari similar to Mail.app? <body> Does Safari have a similar data detector system like Mail.app? I don't think it has this because I am trying to add an event based on date and it doesn't occur. Is the data detector system limited on Safari compared to the Mail app?  <answer271828> Safari only supports the telephone data detector.  It's currently not possible to enable the other data detectors in Safari. (Is there a Safari Extension for adding Mail-style Data Detectors to Web Pages?)
