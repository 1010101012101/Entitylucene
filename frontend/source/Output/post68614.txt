Downloading preorders from iTunes in iOS6 <body> I preordered some music last night via iTunes on my computer at home. I have an iPad at work that is bound to the same iTunes account. I go to the "Purchased" section in iTunes on the iPad and my preorder isn't there. The preorder has been released and i received my confirmation from Apple this morning that it in fact has.  How can I download my preorder?  <comment79701> Has the preorder been released? Can you tell exactly what you preordered? <comment79703> @duci9y - updated. <comment79706> Although I have never preordered tracks before here’s my take. Search for the track in the store on your iPad and download it from there. <comment79708> im afraid that its going to charge me again. <comment79711> What does the button say? Does it say “Buy” or “Download”? <comment79716> it shows the price.
