Can not download el Capitan <body> I have an older Mac computer.  Apple tells me it will run OS thru El Capitan.  It is currently running snow leopard 10.6.8.    When I open "http://iTunes.apple.com/app/os-x-el-capitan/id1147835433?mt=12" I go to the Apple App Store and it says this is the El Capitan download.  There is a blue button on the left side of screen under the large X that says "Get".  If I click on this blue button, the button changes shade of blue as long as I hold the mouse button down, but nothing happens.  If I click on the down arrow on the right side of the blue button, I get two options, "copy link" and "tell a friend".    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BWzKm.png" alt="enter image description here"  How do I download El Capitan?  I called Apple tech support (tier 2) and spend several hours downloading to 10.6.8, but Apple can not tell me why I can not download El Capitan from the App Store.  Any help appreciated!  <answer282861> If neither of the "direct" App Store links (1. El Capitan 2.

Also, this may be trivial, but have you signed into the App Store with your Apple ID?  You need one to download El Cap. <comment356413> How much ram is installed? minimum amount is 4GB. (Take a screenshot of your "About my Mac" section) please, as well as a shot of the download screen. <comment356438> Hello, I can share screen shots, but need to know how to attach.  Yes, I do have an iTunes account.  However, between  tier 2 tech support and trying to download the upgrade myself, I have never been asked to sign in.  I did try after signing in, but am not able to open the page in iTunes, must be done in browser.  My computer has 2 GB of memory, but tier 2 Apple tech support tells me that is enough to get to el Capitan and Apple (https://support.apple.com/kb/sp728?locale=en_US)says 2 GB is enough.  I did download el Capitan on another older computer that had 2GB. <comment356448> [Install OS X El Capitan on Mac - Direct Download](https://7labs.heypub.com/tips-tricks/el-capitan-direct-download.html). This is a hack but it should work. <comment356449> Another direct App Store link: [El Capitan](https://itunes.apple.com/app/os-x-el-capitan/id1147835434?mt=12)! Please check the different id! id1147835434 instead of id1147835433! <comment356465> I wish they still did isos so it was easier to create bootable thumb drives <comment356501> I am sorry, I did not copy/paste, I typed in the address.  The last number is a 4, not a 3.  The address I was using to download el Capitan was: http://iTunes.apple.com/app/os-x-el-capitan/id1147835434?mt=12.
