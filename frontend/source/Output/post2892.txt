OS X - AppleScript Question about moving files daily to another folder (folders vary) <body> I am currently using this ( http://lifehacker.com/193778/download-of-the-day--auto+applescript-tickler-file ) for a tickler file system and have it setup in my Dropbox (so it works across systems). There are just a couple of things from making it perfect. If anyone can help me out that would be superb.  What I'm after is a script or workflow that will take the folders contents for the previous day (they change each day and are numbered) and move them to the current day. So then I can set it in as an alarm to perform in the morning every day.  Thanks very much.  <answer3912> If I understand your requirements correctly, then this script should do what you want. Make sure to change the username on the first line to your username.  precodeset username to "lizzan"  set cy to (year of (current date)) as integer set cm to (month of (current date)) as integer set cd to (day of (current date)) as integer  set yd to yesterday(cy, cm, cd)  set yy to item 1 of yd set ym to item 2 of yd set yd to item 3 of yd   set yFolder to "Macintosh HD:Users:" &amp; username &amp; ":Documents:To Do:" &amp; yy &amp; ":" &amp; ym &amp; ":" &amp; yd set cFolder to "Macintosh HD:Users:" &amp; username &amp; ":Documents:To Do:" &amp; cy &amp; ":" &amp; cm &amp; ":" &amp; cd  tell application "Finder"     move every file of folder yFolder to cFolder end tell  on yesterday(y, m, d)     set d to d - 1      if d ≤ 0 then         set m to m - 1         if m ≤ 0 then             set y to y - 1             set m to 12         end if         set thirtyones to {1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12}         set thirties to {4, 6, 9, 11}         if m is in thirtyones then             set d to 31         else if m is in thirties then             set d to 30         else if leapyear(y) then             set d to 29         else             set d to 28         end if      end if      set yd to {y, m, d}     return yd  end yesterday  on leapyear(y)     if y mod 4 is 0 then         if y mod 100 is 0 then             if y mod 400 is 0 then                 return true             end if             return false         end if         return true     end if      return false  end leapyear /code/pre  Caveat: The script will fail (and have moved possibly only some of your files) if there is already a file with the same name in the folder it is moving to. If you want to replace the files in that case, and avoid failing, add codewith replacing/code at the end of line 18 (codemove every ... to cFolder with replacing/code).  strongEdit to add:/strong Oh, just saw that you had it set up in your Dropbox instead of in the Documents folder. Just change the paths on lines 14 and 15 to reflect the path you're using, and it should be fine.   <answer3977> A very simple solution is an strongAutomator Application/strong (workflow that runs independently).  Took about 15 seconds (literally) to set this workflow up: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/P3d2k.png" alt="alt text"  <comment3754> Superb! It worked! I needed to make a couple of changes, but yes! You are superb - Thank you!!! Yeah I changed the location to the Dropbox and I also changed Macintosh HD to Main HD and it was all good. <comment3758> @Sulcalibur Thanks, it was my pleasure to help - wouldn't have done it if I didn't think it would be fun...=) <comment3780> While certainly useful in its own right, I don't think this does what the OP wanted it to do. This workflow will move files created in the last day, but from what I understand of the tickler file system you place files in folders for the day you're supposed to deal with them. If not dealt with on that day, they should be moved to the current day to prevent them being forgotten. So, the files to move could have been created at any time, really.
