Macbook Pro Always print in grey scale <body> Whenever I print something from my macbook the printout is always in color.  On my windows machine, I could go to my printer preferences and set it to always print in grayscale. Then, no matter what application is printing, they always printed in black &amp; white.  I have searched and I have not found a setting on my Mac which allows me to say "color prints are expensive so dont use color when printing".  In other words, "always use grayscale or black and white" when printing.  Where can I change my printing preferences to always use grayscale?  <answer258792> You can set Print prefs &amp; defaults from any print dialogue - kbd Cmd âŒ˜ /kbd kbd P /kbd  - though specific options change with each printer type..  An example -   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DMIEO.png" alt="enter image description here"  First, in the lower half, look for 'Color' or a similar option. In there you should be able to define how to handle colour printing.  Once you have set that, then at the top where it says "Default Settings, you can save the current setup &amp; then define it as your new default.  Advanced options at the bottom of the dialog will very much be printer-dependant.
