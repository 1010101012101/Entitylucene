Logging out kills the browser and the download./li liDrop the microphone and walk away./li /ol  <comment349775> The implication of sleep is that processes stop. Perhaps there's a more subtle problem you face? If so am edit to your question explaining the situation will cause the hold to be reviewed. <comment349783> Do you just want to turn off the monitor? What is a macbook mini? Logging out will definitely not work because Chrome is a user process. <comment349785> i want to keep in standby by continuing tasks to save power <comment349942> so i have to walk away!! :0)
