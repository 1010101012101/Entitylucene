How to Access Shared Computer Through Terminal? <body> I have Mavericks on my Mac and wish to set up Unison between it and an old PC (vaiolaptop) running Windows XP on my network. How so I specify the path to the remote machine?  It appears like so in finder and I can navigate through it in Finder just fine.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/L1ZBS.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer140806> I first created a  mapped network drive of the folder I wanted access to following this guide. (YES, codesmb://&lt;windows machine network name&gt;/code worked to reference my windows machine without having to do any sort of configuration or installation on that machine.) Then merely specified path to the mounted drive under code/Volumes//code.  <comment164013> If it has SMB You can check Terminal command: `mount_smbfs`
