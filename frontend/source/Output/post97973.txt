How Can I Send Text (and Not a Text File) to My Printer on OS X? <body> I know about this question (How do I send ASCII text to printer (over USB)?).  But I'm working on something different.  I'd like to be able to send text from within a bash script or Perl script to my printer.  Everything I find tells me about sending a text file to my printer.  Is there any way to send text from within a script?  (That way I don't have to generate the text, save it as a file, then print the file, then delete the file.)  <answer97985> You are probably talking about RAW printing.     What is Raw Printing?      "Raw Printing", "DOS Printing", "Line Mode Printing", or generically   any "Page Description Language (PDL)", are all examples of sending a   series of characters directly to the printer in the printer's native   language. This is the recommended approach when using jZebra because   jZebra is able to bypasses the default print behavior of your web   browser and allows you to "program" your own print commands.

Use a filename of "-" to force printing from the standard input.   So if you followed the advice given in the referenced question to install a "raw" printer you should be able to run  precodeecho "whatever text you want to print" | lp -d Generic_usbtb - /code/pre  <comment114978> What printer are you using ?? <comment115016> That works, but with a glitch.  Do you know how I'd specify a line feed or carriage return?  I tried "\n" as well as "\r" and they come through literally. <comment115019> That's some good information, but it's a lot of work, kind of like going around your thumb to get to your elbow. <comment115022> Generically, to any printer.  Most of the time I'm using a Brother HL 1440. <comment115028> Found it.  Use "echo -e" to enable escaped characters and with that "\n" gives me a linefeed and carriage return.
