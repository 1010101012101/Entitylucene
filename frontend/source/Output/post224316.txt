How to get started with MySQL on Mac <body> I'm all very new to mySQL. I've installed it from the Oracle website, and I think I managed to run the server with the command:  precodesudo ./mysqld_safe --console /code/pre  But it's impossible to open the client and have the "mysql" prompt that nobody else seems to have a hard time having. I tried:  ul licode./mysql/code/li licode./mysql -u root -p/code/li licode./mysql -u root -p root/code/li licode./mysql -u myusername/code/li /ul  etc...(I also tried with 'sudo' first)  I always get the same message:  precodeERROR 1045 (28000): Access denied for user 'xxxxx'@'localhost' (using password: XX) /code/pre  As you see, I don't really know what I'm doing. Any tips?  <answer224317> h1Post Install Set-up/h1  Have you been through the post installation set up?  In particular, Securing the Initial MySQL Accounts is important because it sets up the default users and passwords.  h2brew/h2  You may want to try installing MySQL via the homebrew project. With codebrew/code installed, you can install MySQL using the command:  precodebrew install mysql /code/pre  h2MAMP/h2  Alternatively, MAMP offers an application based edition of MySQL. Launching the application starts a preconfigured copy of MySQL for you – and it includes the web-based myphpadmin.  With regard to your comment wanting a free solution, MAMP is free:     Similar to a Linux-Distribution, strongMAMP is a combination of free software and thus it is offered free of charge./strong MAMP is released under the GNU General Public License and may thereby be distributed freely within the boundaries of this license.   <answer264930> See what the path is to MySQL and make sure there isn't another installation conflicting with the one installed by composer. In terminal:  precodenano ~/.bash_profile /code/pre  You might see something like:  precodeexport PATH="/usr/local/mysql/bin:$PATH" /code/pre  You can reset the root password once you know where to call mysql from:  precode/path/to/mysql/bin/mysqladmin -u root password [yourpasswordhere] /code/pre  My path to MySQL is /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqladmin  What Operating system are you running? I used to use MAMP but I didn't care for it. I prefer to set up my own LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQl, PHP) using the details outlined in this tutorial:  https://coolestguidesontheplanet.com/get-apache-mysql-php-phpmyadmin-working-osx-10-10-yosemite/  <comment272040> Ok thanks, I did not see that one. I went through it and tried, as they say, to type "./mysql -u root" but still got the same error msg. Actually it's weird, because it's written that I should type "mysql ..." (without the "./") but that does not work ("command not found") <comment272042> I also tried with brew: After installation, I could run the "mysql -uroot" command, as they suggest, and still got the same error msg... <comment272043> Actually I still got this error msg even if the server is not running. I have no idea what to do... <comment272044> Given this is more about MySQL than Mac, try asking over on http://dba.stackexchange.com/ – they specialise on database set up and administration. Hopefully someone there will be better able to help identify this error message. <comment272045> Have you tried [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/)? <comment272049> I am looking for a free solution <comment272050> MAMP is free. I have updated the answer to include MAMP's free licensing statement.
