Is there a service that allows distributing iOS builds per git branches? <body> All the beta services I've looked into (TestFlight, HockeyApp, Fabric beta, Test, DeloyGate, ...) seem to only allow one "active" build per app, or one per version (the actual x.x.x version and nothing else).  For QA purposes, I would like to be able to publish builds strongper branch/strong of my github repo. Ideally, testers would have an interface where they could install the last build of branch codefeature/money/code or codefeature/coins/code, with everything else that is already offered by regular services (push notifications, UDID handling if not using enterprise certificates, ...)  Does this exist?
