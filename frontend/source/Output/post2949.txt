Will iPhone App Update to new version will remove all the ratings? <body> I plan to update my app with new features. If I publish a new version say V 1.0.1 then will I loose all my ratings from version 1.0.   <answer2950> Apple splits your App's ratings into two sections; strong"Current Version"/strong and strong"All Versions"/strong.  The preference on the App Store is to display the "current version" ratings, however aggregated historical ratings and reviews are also available.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wif1z.png" alt="App Store"  <comment2615> awesome! thanks for the answer.
