Why I can't see the “price” tab in itunes producer <body> I'm submiting my first book to the Ibook store.  Problem : In Itunes Producer, I can't see the "price" tab ? Do you know why ?img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/y1PwR.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer124575> When you create an account on iTunes Connect in order to distribute books, you can either create a strongFree Books Account/strong or a strongPaid Books Account/strong.  Apparently, for the strongPrice/strong tab to appear in strongiTunes Producer/strong, you have to be logged in with a strongPaid Books Account/strong. Make sure you followed the right procedure when you did create your account. If you didn’t, I’m quite sure you can somehow switch from emFree/em to emPaid/em. I don’t know how, though.  <comment145658> I’m not familiar with iTunes producer, but with most apps, you can actually edit the toolbar. Try right-clicking it. <comment145660> Nope... Weirdly, I see image like that on Internet http://selfpublisherbibel.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/itunesproducer3.jpg    and we can see the price tab on the top <comment145688> Still just fishing around: when you created your iTunes connect account, did you make sure you created a *Paid* Books account and not a *Free* Books account? <comment145719> You're right ! It was that !
