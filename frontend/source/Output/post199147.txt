Trust Mac on iPad automatically <body> It is very annoying to "Trust this computer" every time I connect my iPad to Mac.   Is there a way to "trust" my Mac by my iPad automatically?  <comment238574> Weird. I only had to tap "Trust This Computer" on my iPhone and iPad the first time I connected each one. <comment238638> Can you tell me the Version of Mac OS you are running? <comment238641> @bMalum I run Yosemity with all the updates. <comment284005> Same problem here, but with a Windows machine as the host.  Everytime the iPad is connected (or powered up after being off, while still attached) it prompts me to "Trust". <comment288940> Have you called Apple?
