iMac forgets brightness <body> When I set my brightness on a 27'' iMac (2011) next time it boots up, it's dimmed. I switched off the ambient sensor, so this shouldn't be the problem. The connected Cinema Display remembers the brightness correctly.  Had anyone the same problem and found a solution?  <answer27098> I have heard a few people complain of brightness resetting on reboot. Traditionally brightness settings are stored in the PRAM, which you can reset via kbd⌘/kbdkbd⌥/kbdkbdP/kbdkbdR/kbd on booting. I would be interested to see if it gets "stuck" on a brightness setting that you do not wish to have after resetting the PRAM.  <comment31005> Does not changed the behavior. Rebooted and hold down the key combination ( it rebooted again ). Then set my desired brightness, rebooted and the same problem again. <comment31016> What version of OS X are you running, and which brightness level do you have it set on? <comment31022> Snow Leopard with all updates applied. For testing purposes I have tried to set it to maximum, but it returns to three or four ( I must reboot to look for the exact level ) <comment31023> The exact level it reverts to is three. If I remove the two Cinema Displays attached, it reverts to six. The Cinema Displays aren't affected by this behavior. <comment31039> Try setting it one or two levels below maximum and restart. I know that people have said if it's set to the max or min level that can happen. If you still have the same result there's a couple more things you can try. I could make a tiny script that will automatically boost it up where you want it whenever you restart, etc. if you run out of possible possibilities. <comment31150> Tried to set it to a value lower than max and rebooted. Reverted back. I'm going to test that tomorrow with the Cinemadisplays disconnected. <comment31674> Tested with Cinema Displays disconnected. No change in behavior other than the value it's reverting to changed. <comment38266> I am having the same problem. I double checked Energy settings which has options for adjusting brightness, but settings for this have been disabled and it stills dims.
