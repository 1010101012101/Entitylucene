I'm having trouble with my administrator information <body> I don't have administrator access for my MacBook Air and I need the username and password to be able to administer my laptop.  <answer203119> Boot off the recovery partition, open up terminal, and type  codereset password/code  That should bring up a dialog that will allow you to change your password If, for some reason, the default account is not set as admin, you will need to boot into Single User Mode (kbdâŒ˜-S/kbd when starting up) and type:  codemount -uw / rm /var/db/.AppleSetupDone/code  This makes the file system writeable, and then removes the file that tells OS X that you've setup the system. Hit kbdCtrl-D/kbd to continue your boot and you should get the "Welcome to Macintosh" startup and you will be able to setup a NEW account (make sure it is a new account). This account will be an admin account.
