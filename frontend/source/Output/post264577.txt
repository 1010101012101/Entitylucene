MacBook Pro 13" Retina late 2012 <body> This works perfectly until I saw replace battery, didn't mind and I used it for extra long time until I it was powering with a little high noice. After then it went dead. From then the charger wasn't showing any light when connected. Can I replace the battery to have it work again please?
