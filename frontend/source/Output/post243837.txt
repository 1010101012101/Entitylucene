Left Shift not working for combination with [ <body> I have an Apple (wired aluminum) Keyboard (using with Mac mini).  Left codeShift + [/code does not work (to type code{/code). But Right codeShift + [/code works.  Left codeShift/code key is working for all the other keys.  I tried this keyboard with my laptop and the behavior is same.  I assumed it is hardware problem. I tried disconnecting and cleaning from outside and shaking off dust and debris.   What other measures should I take to correct this malfunction? or this keyboard is gonna die?  One of the other strange behavior is on USB connection, the keyboard automatically types code-/code until I presses a key. (only on Mac Mini)   <answer285078> I think it was Keyboard Ghosting problem. You can read more here  The problem was solved after I have tried pressing the key combinations (involving non-working key, in my case code[/code).  There are a lot of combinations and so I don't include it here. In case it disappeared, here is the archive version on the archive.org.  <comment300367> I found the [Keyboard Ghosting Explained](https://www.microsoft.com/appliedsciences/antighostingexplained.mspx) and after testing with some key combination there my key left `shift+[` to type `{` is working again. <comment359031> I am having the same problem. How did you fix it? <comment359480> @gdaniel press the key combinations described in the link. It is too much to include in here.
