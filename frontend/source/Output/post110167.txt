Memory runs out issue with a Mac Air 11.6", Mac OSX 10.9 <body> I use word 2010 a lot, with medium length documents (10-20pages) It sometimes takes 2 gigs of RAM just for word. Why is that? none of the files themselves are over 50mb. The Mac then freezes or various programs stop responding (primarily mail). Also the task kernel_task sometimes takes upwards of 500mb... what can be done about that? is there some memory purge procedure or software for the Mac.. or some other system level solution?   we use the same documents exactly on Word for the PC that has the same amount of RAM, and never had such problems...we made sure Office and the OSX got all available updates.  Thanks for any help.. attached is the Activity monitor process list...

Also, Word doesn't seem to be running on the screenshot. Can you add some details about which specific issues you see in which application, how they relate to Word and how the memory usage is with Word running? <comment129810> Add some other columns to your Activity Monitor e.g. Real Memory, but you don't have memory issues there as your swap memory is 0and memory used very much less than Physical (it will be less but more like 3.9G if all used)
