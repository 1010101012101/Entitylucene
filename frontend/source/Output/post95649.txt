Change name and Application icon when starting via Automator <body> I have a script called gnus:  precode#!/bin/bash open -n -a Emacs --args --name Mail --title Mail --no-desktop --no-splash --funcall gnus /code/pre  which I call via Automator   precodeRun Shell Script - ~/bin/gnus /code/pre  Now I the name next to the icon in the dock, when the program is running, is still Emacs and thew Emacs icon (as when starting Emacs.app directly.  I would like to have the gnus icon and the name as Gnus as I want to pin it to one specific Desktop.  How can I achieve this?  <answer95661> You could make a copy of the application bundle:  precodecp -r /Applications/{Emacs,gnus}.app defaults write /Applications/gnus.app/Contents/Info.plist CFBundleExecutable gnus defaults write /Applications/gnus.app/Contents/Info.plist CFBundleIdentifier my.gnus echo $'#!/bin/bash\n/Applications/gnus.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs --name Mail --title Mail --no-desktop --no-splash --funcall gnus' &gt; /Applications/gnus.app/Contents/MacOS/gnus chmod +x /Applications/gnus.app/Contents/MacOS/gnus /code/pre  I changed the bundle identifier because spaces assignments are per bundle identifier. It also makes the application have a different preferences file.  I don't know how to change the application name.  <comment112229> The issue here is that you are running Emacs.app just with arguments to it <comment112243> To change name normally rename the executable and the App however emacs is a complex build so that might not work
