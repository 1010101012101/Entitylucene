iPad 2 & iPhone 4 - move iPad user account to iPhone account on same PC? <body> We currently have 2 iPhones, and ipad 2 and an iPod Touch 1st Gen. At the moment, each device has it's own "user" on Windows, so if I want ti update the iPad I login to the iPad user when I boot Windows.  What I'd like to do is move the iPad to my own iTunes and manage my iPhone and iPad from the same iTunes as one Windows User.  How can I port my iPad iTunes over to my iPhone iTunes so that if I login to Windows as iPhone, I can connect my iPad and be able to sync and backup the iPad apps etc?  I assume if I just plug the iPad into my iPhone User iTunes without somehow porting it's data over from the other User account, it will just treat the iPad as a fresh device and want to start it again?  <comment87759> Where have you purchased the music/movies/apps? iTunes or somewhere else? If from iTunes, have you used the same Apple ID for all your devices?
