Do any OS X apps ease Search and Replace across multiple files? <body> I'm looking for an OS X tool which allows me to search and replace a search string in multiple files. The requirements are the following:  ul liSearch and Replace/li liSearch by regular expression/li liSearch across multiple files/li liSearch across nested directory structures/li liReplace expression can use values from the search (Regular Expression)/li liThe tool has an easy to use user interface/li liPreferably free/li /ul  I know that some text editors like emBBEdit/em have this functionality, but I would prefer a lightweight tool that doesn't require me to open the files for editing first.  If there aren't any tools to match these requirements, I would also consider a command line alternative. I know that codeperl/code and codesed/code support something like this - a solution that I can define either as a Bash emalias/em or emfunction/em would be welcome in this case.  <answer82774> You don't have to open the files with BBEdit. You just point it to a folder. It's a very powerful tool, one that I've often used with large numbers of HTML files.   <answer82778> I typically use TextMate:    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/swBtT.png" alt="TextMate Search and Replace dialog"  TextMate (1) is/was a buy product, but TextMate 2 is currently under active openSource development on gitHub and free to use.  <answer82904> In addition to the other solutions using a text editor, I have found emFAR - Find and Replace/em, a multi-platform find and replace tool. It's not the prettiest one, but it looks like it does what I'm looking for.  http://findandreplace.sourceforge.net/  <answer83502> Sublime Text is what I use, it's great!  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/deGI6.png" alt="screenshot of find and replace"  Sublime Text:  ul liis free to evaluate (no time limit imposed)/li lican search and replace/li lican search by regular expression/li lican search across multiple files/li lican search across nested directory structures/li lican use values from the search in replace expression/li lihas an easy to use user interface/li /ul  <answer83544> I often use Ruby scripts like this:  precodeDir["**/*.txt"].each { |f|   IO.write(f, IO.read(f).gsub(/search/, "replace")) } /code/pre  Or you can use codegets(nil)/code with code-i/code:  precoderuby -i -e 'print gets(nil).gsub(/search/, "replace")' *.txt /code/pre  If you install Bash 4 and enable globstar, you can use code**/code in shells as well:  precodesed -i '' 's/search/replace/g' **/*.txt /code/pre  <answer83717> This is exactly codesed/code was written and it matches all of your requirements, except the learning curve is a bit steep.   For a more gentle learning curve, try TextWrangler from BareBones. It uses the BBEdit text engine and, I believe, has the full search &amp; replace functionality of its big brother  <answer130893> Take a look at my App Search and Replace. You can use it on multiple files or directories, safe your search/replace strings and you can use regular expressions.  <comment96163> Can you please be a bit more specific and describe how SublimeText solves the problem described in the question? <comment96263> Their website (link provided tells you everything) but...  It is free to evaluate (no time limit imposed) Search and Replace - YES. Search by regular expression - YES. Search across multiple files - YES. Search across nested directory structures - YES. Replace expression can use values from the search (Regular Expression) - YES. The tool has an easy to use user interface - YES. Preferably free - YES (sort of). <comment96425> I'm familiar with some bash programming and scripting, but have never done anything advanced with `sed`. Can you provide an example for how to use `sed` to replace text in a series of files, like in the (currently) above `ruby` answer? <comment153633> How does this work - why is it better than other answers - please provide more than a link <comment153647> Hi and welcome to Ask Different! While we don't mind developers recommending their products when they do solve problems being presented, we do ask you provide clear context for why your product is an answer and how it solves the problem. For more information on how Ask Different and the StackExchange Q&A format works please see our [FAQ](http://apple.stackexchange.com/faq). <comment155689> I guess it has about the same features as the other tools recommended here. The difference is you have a GUI and you can save files containing your search/replace strings. It has all of the functionality nwinkler asked for. It can search and replace (also using regular expressions) across multiple files/nested directory structures and has (at least that's what i think) an easy to use GUI.
