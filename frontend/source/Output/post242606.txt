iMessage log in Problem <body> This is the error I am getting at the moment when I try to log into iMessage. The same error occured when using FaceTime. I can use my appleID for the Appstore.  Do you know what I can do about this?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VHPg3.png" alt="error message"  <answer242643> This is a commmon problem with Hackintosh'ed computers. Is the computer you are using with OSX genuine?  Wether it is a real Mac device or not, the steps to fix this should be very similar. Here is a strongvery/strong long thread describing each step to fix this in great detail.  To start off, I would make sure that your Apple ID is verified. You can check the 'Verified' status of your AppleID by logging into AppleID's online management.  <comment298532> It could be that Apple's servers are bogged down because of the WWDC and release of new OS's to developers. I'm not seeing any system outages, though. I would try again later. https://www.apple.com/support/systemstatus/ <comment298798> thank you for the reply. The Hardware is real mac and the software as well, as far as I know. I have turned off system integrety protection as the only modification to the normal OS X. Where can I find the verified status? I logged in but cant find it.
