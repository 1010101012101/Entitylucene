What SSL VPN client do you recommend for the mac? <body> I am currently using FortiClient. It would be nice to use the native MacOS VPN client (in the Settings) but I don't think it supports strongSSL/strong VPN. I googled but did not find anything. Does anyone have a SSL VPN mac client to recommend? It has to support strongSSL VPN/strong.  <answer202749> At our company we use TunnelBlick, free, customisable and very stable.br It support SSL VPN without any problem.  <comment244580> How can a VPN not be SSL? What specifically are your requirements?
