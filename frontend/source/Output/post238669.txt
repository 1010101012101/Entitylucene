Are there any advantages to using GNU over the default OSX command line utilities? <body> Are there any advantages to using GNU utilities (installed via homebrew) as opposed to the default, BSD based OSX utilities? They seem very similar to me, but I will not pretend to be a master of command line, just an intermediate user.  <comment292759> Minor differences, really. If you're used to GNU, you might want only GNU. <comment292811> Welcome to Ask Different, Kevin. Could you perhaps show a bit of your research or describe what you would consider an advantage. For example - the syntax on [gawk vs awk](http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/29576/difference-between-gawk-vs-awk) varies. If you have a lot of scripts that assume GNU extensions, it would be a disadvantage to not have the GNU versions. On the other hand, if you break a script assuming awk - installing the tools is a disadvantage.
