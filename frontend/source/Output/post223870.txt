MacBook Air stolen - questions <body> My Macbook Air was stolen. I've reported it to police, who can't do anything about it in a multi-unit apartment building. It's been locked since shortly after the theft (I'm hoping because the thief put in too many wrong passwords), but I can see that it's been online from time to time. First, how can the thief go online with my computer without a password? (I'm assuming he/she hasn't wiped it, since Find my Mac is still working.)  Unfortunately, I can't seem to remotely erase it. I'm assuming that's because it's locked?? Any other way to do my best to make sure they don't get access to things I don't want them to? Thanks.  <comment271412> If the hacker is that good then he should be attempting to go to recovery mode were he would use an internet connection.
