How can I tether my VZW iPad 4 over AT&T? <body> I have a VZW iPad 4 connected to my AT&amp;T Family Share plan.  After inserting the AT&amp;T SIM, it provisioned itself nicely to AT&amp;T and even picks up AT&amp;T wifi hotspots.  The only piece missing is LTE, which I can live without.  It is not allowing me to turn the iPad into a Personal Hotspot.  The options is not available under Settings, and when I go to Settings  Cellular Data, I have a blue link for "Set Up Personal Hotspot" which opens a web browser to AT&amp;T's website.  I confirmed with AT&amp;T that the iPad is provisioned for tethering.  What can I do to get iOS to pick up this provisioning and allow me to tether?
