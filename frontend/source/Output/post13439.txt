How can I create a shortcut to switch to a specific keyboard layout? <body> See I installed some chinese input methods, and some of them have already shortcuts, I'd like to add a shortcut for the one I use mainly so I can come back from chinese quickly without grabbing the mouse.br I inspected the pref pane for keyboard shortcuts but couldn't find out how.  PS: Mine is ArgenPinYin, a customized keyboard layout  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/e0GgQ.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer13445> You'll notice that the shortcuts only appear when you're using Chinese input methods. They don't appear otherwise per this article from Apple's knowledgebase.  I can't find any way around this limitation. However, there is a built-in keyboard shortcut for switching between keyboard layouts, if not for switching to a specific keyboard layout. You can find this shortcut in System Preferences - Keyboard - Keyboard &amp; Text Input:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cSCPx.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment14428> Yes I saw that, thanks anyway.
