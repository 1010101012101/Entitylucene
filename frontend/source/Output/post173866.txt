How can I set the display settings using command line <body> I would like to configure the 'Scaled' property of my Macbook Pro display using the command line. How could I do that?  <answer173875> I have an early 2013 MacBook Pro with Retina Display running OS X 10.8.5 and I've tested cscreen command line utility and it works to change resolution via the command line.  You can download the cscreenIntel.dmg from the link provided. In a terminal use codecscreen -h/code to output the internal help information. An example of use: codecscreen -d 32 -x 1680 -y 1050/code  BTW As far as I know Intel based versions of OS X do not include a native executable and why I'm pointing you to a third-party utility.  <answer224928> precode$ git clone https://github.com/jhford/screenresolution.git $ cd screenresolution $ make dmg $ ./screenresolution set 1920x1080x32@60 /code/pre  csreen did not do any thing for me on os x 10.10.5.
