Will this RAM work for me? (Late 2009 iMac) <body> I have a 27-inch iMac late 2009 desktop computer and i'm looking to upgrade my ram. The best RAM I can find is a Kingston 2GB, DDR3-1066, PC3-8500, CL7, DIMM.  What I currently have is 4GB 1067 MHz Ram  Will this be suitable? Or is this the wrong one?   <answer74900> You can find out the memory summary by going to:  ï£¿  About This Mac  More Info  Memory  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JesXr.png" alt="enter image description here"  supScreenshot example/sup  You can also go to Technical Specifications, click "Browse by Product", and enter the serial number of your Mac to see the specs.  It's always a good idea to read the return policy from the vendors, in case the RAM that you bought was not compatible with your computer.  <answer167521> it should work.  i would just make sure you can return it just in case.  when you put the new ram in the mac will beep if the ram is not acceptable.  <comment196404> My Mac doesn't beep if the RAM is wrong, it sets a different pattern of lights on the mobo.
