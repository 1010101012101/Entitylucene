Pre-installed movies and photos on new MBA <body> MBA 13"   I when I got it home for the first time. I switched it on I checked how much disk space I had left. I was surprised to see 45MB of movies and photos 471MB.  I can't find the movies and the photos in the finder window. Where are they and what are they?  Many thanks for any suggestions.  <answer101785> em(Not able to comment, since I don't have enough rep)/em  My understanding is that they are tutorial pictures and videos from pre-installed apps such as keynote, iPhoto or Garageband.   You could use a image file reducer such as JPEGmini to reduce the file size of those images, but there's probably no need.  <answer101807> I just made the following test :   precode sudo find /system -name "*.png" | wc -l /code/pre  returns 4553 on my mac : There are over 4000 images in my code/System//code directory. It's probably your case too.    Using   precodesudo find /system -name "*.png" -print0 | xargs -0 du | awk '{total+=$1} END{print total}' /code/pre  I get 248352K, that 250MB. Not your 450MB but we are getting close. You can assume the files you see are system files (yes your system uses images and video !)   I would definitely strongnot/strong suggest to delete theses files since they are used by the system.   <comment119900> Where did you see you had 471MB of photos ? <comment119905> I went to 'about this mac" and on the storage it gives the details. However, I can't find them in the finder. I think they are just samples that I want to remove as its disk space I want to save. Thanks.
