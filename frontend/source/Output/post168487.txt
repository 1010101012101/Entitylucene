Export iCloud items from Keychain to CSV <body> I want to export all my accounts login/password from Keychain. But you have many categories like : login, iCloud, System... in the Keychain menu. In fact I want to export them to 1Password, so I follow this overflow answer.  But in code~/Library/Keychains//code I have only the codelogin.keychain/code and not the hopefully codeiCloud.keychain/code...  I have 422 accounts in the iCloud category and only 5 on the login category...  So my question is, how can I save/export this iCloud category   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QgLh4.png" alt="enter image description here"  into a keychain or .csv file ?  EDIT :  I have already a login.keychain file. But I don't know how I can make an iCloud.keychain file.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rtGQ8.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer168489> 1Password 4 for Mac now supports importing of CSV format files  iCloud (Apple) Keychain items can be exported to a CSV file using script: Convert OS X Keychain exported entries into logins for 1Password import  Another option is to save new items to 1Password after they've been filled with login details from Safari's AutoFill (which can remain enabled as long as you'd like).  please refer this discussions. You'll probably find particularly helpful posts #20 from AgileBits and #39 from AgileBits.  <answer192018> A late reply, as I found this post while searching for something related.  You have to create a new keychain, and copy your iCloud keychain items to the new local keychain.  Then you can use the security tool to dump them.  Since this is 1Password-related question, for others in the future, you can use MrC's conversion utility to directly convert the keychain dump into a 1Password consumable 1PIF file.  It is much better than CSV importing.  https://discussions.agilebits.com/discussion/30286/mrcs-convert-to-1password-utility/p1  <comment197777> This github script take the login.keychain but I want the iCloud category. So my question is, how can I export the iCloud category into .keychain file for using the git script above or how can I export the iCloud category directly in CSV. <comment197784> (If you have multiple keychains you should repeat this whole process once from step 2 onwards for  each one. You will have to change 'login.keychain' to 'foo.keychain' or somesuch.) <comment197953> So, that's why I am asking for "how to make the iCloud.keychain" file... You can see my edit above.
