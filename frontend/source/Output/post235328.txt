How can I make two cells edit and display the same information in Numbers? <body> I would like two cells to contain the same information, if I modify one the other should modify also.  I was using the Concatenate function to make "slave" cells that pull data from a "source" cell but I have to travel back to the source cell and modify it there. Are there other ways to do this?  <answer235341> You can't make 2 cells which content would be synchronised from each other.  To define b1=$a$1 and a1=$b$1 would create a loop of cross references.  This graph of dependency would be a cycle.  On the other hand you van make 2 cells depend on a common source:  a2=$a$1 and b2=$a$1.  This graph of dependency is a tree.  <comment287843> What is your original problem which solution would require 2 cells to be different and have the same value and at the same time beingâ€¦ different.
