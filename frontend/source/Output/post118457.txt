Changing OSX Mavericks Server to default to personal website rather than welcome page <body> I've looked at every option in OSX Server for Mavericks but I don't see anything that allows me to default to my website rather than the "Welcome to Server" page. I have a DNS set up through Godaddy. I had no issues before I installed OSX server. I tried using an alias but that still requires that the URL I provide people has to include that alias. Not a good solution.   <answer118490> The way to do this within Mavericks Server is to adjust the Server Website Preferences to the folder you are locating your HTML pages.  Here's how to do it:  ol liOpen up the Server application, and select on Websites, underbr Services./li liDouble click on "Server Website" under Websites./li liNext to the option titled "Store Site Files In:", click the text box, select "Other...", navigate to the location where your website is stored, and select its top level folder./li liClick the "OK" button/li /ol  That should be all. If networking/DNS/Port Forwarding are properly set, you should now be able to load your site.   <comment138270> That did it! Thanks a ton
