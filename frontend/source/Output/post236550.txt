Text shortcuts reset to older settings in System Preferences <body> I use the strongText shortcuts replace/strong function provided by Mac OS X's emSystem Preferences' Keyboard/em panel quite often. It helps me type things faster in most applications, such as my phone number, my full address, etc.  Lately, I've noticed that the text fields that I have recently updated got deleted/replaced by older values (maybe it's synchronized with a Cloud backup?). It's not the first time it does that.  This is what I have in strongsituation 1/strong (correct information):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/W8N8n.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  And after a few days when I'll use one of these shortcuts, I'll find that they have been replaced to previous info. strongSituation 2/strong presents old info as such:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WwPqC.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  So I have to go back to Keyboard preferences, and re-type my current information where needed each time.  Where is this old info coming from? Another Cloud-linked device? Since this happens on a computer connected to the internet, why won't the info update on all devices when I edit it?  <answer236572> Yes, they cross-pollinate from other devices. Mine come from my phone.  I'm really not certain why they don't correctly sync both ways. If I add one to the Mac it appears on the phone, but ones deleted from the Mac don't necessarily delete from the phone &amp; may later re-appear on the Mac.  I've found the best solution is to just make sure you've also deleted them from any other device.br Settings  General  Keyboards  Text Replacement
