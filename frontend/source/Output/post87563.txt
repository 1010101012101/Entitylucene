How do I use screencapture for capturing floating windows? <body> I am trying to automate the periodic capture of a floating window. Specifically, of the floating 'Current Call' window which is used by Skype when the main window is off-screen.  By googling, I found out that all I need is a window id to pass to screencapture:  precodescreencapture -l&lt;win_id&gt; &lt;output_file&gt; /code/pre  The problem is that I haven't found a way to get the window id for "Current Call". Here is what I have tried so far:  precode$ osascript -e 'tell app "Skype" to id of first window whose floating is true' 20:61: execution error: Skype got an error: Can’t get window 1 whose floating = true. Invalid index. (-1719) $ osascript -e 'tell app "Skype" to id of first window whose name is "Current Call"' 20:67: execution error: Skype got an error: Can’t get window 1 whose name = "Current Call". Invalid index. (-1719) /code/pre  Does anyone know how to get the window id for the "Current Call" window?  Or, alternatively, does anyone know if I can get this screenshot in some other way? (e.g. run codescreencapture/code with other arguments, or use some other tool for capturing the screenshot)  hr  strongUpdate/strong  I have also tried the following:  precode$ osascript -e 'tell app "Skype" to id of window 0' -1 $ osascript -e 'tell app "Skype" to id of window 1' -1 $ osascript -e 'tell app "Skype" to id of window 2' 84 $ osascript -e 'tell app "Skype" to id of window 3' 20:22: execution error: Skype got an error: Can’t get window 3. Invalid index. (-1719) /code/pre  Window with id 84 is the main skype window. So, I'm a bit puzzled here. What is code-1/code supposed to mean?  <answer87570> Try:  precodetell application "Skype" to id of first window whose name = "" /code/pre  <answer177810> I wrote a command line utility that wraps over codescreencapture/code and the Quartz windowing library.  Grab it here: https://github.com/thismachinechills/pyscreencapture  Use it like this:  precode./screencapture.py Skype -t Current Call -w all_windows above_window /code/pre  <comment102383> Did you try this? It returns some window id but the screen capture for it gives me this image, which I have no idea what is: http://i.imgur.com/3KDh1rA.png <comment102384> I didn't try the screen capture. I just found the new window id. <comment102397> I tried again, with the same skype call running. This time I got `Invalid index. (-1719)`. Weird...
