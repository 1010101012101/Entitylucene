Warning "disk full" while more than 100 GB space free in disk utility <body> Why does the system warn me for "startup disk full" while "disk utility" shows there are still more than 100 GB space free?  The warning is in the form of a pop-up dialog.  Not sure how many partitions it has (Disk utility shows only one single disk); what I am sure is there is no other system like Windows installed in this computer.  Disk utility's "verify disk" says there seems to be no error.  MacBook Mac OS X 10.7.5  <comment163628> Do you have other partitions on your disk ? <comment163636> How does the system warn you (dialog in Finder, log message, something else)? <comment163659> Question edited.
