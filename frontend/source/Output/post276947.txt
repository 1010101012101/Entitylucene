My headphones output on MacBook Air give a bubbly sound after using USB speakers <body> My headphones output on MacBook Air give bubbly sound after using USB Speakers. My external speakers function as normal, there's no red light coming out of the headphone socket, but the sound I do get sounds mixed up with a digital output, but it isn't.  I tried all (hopefully not) the tricks I found so far on the web: sticking a piece of wood, jerking it softly, tried the sound flower app, changed all settings, and even backed up my SSD and did a clean install.   How can I figure out what is up with the poor sound?
