Is there a hidden preference to get Mission Control to show application icons when grouping is turned off? <body> When I turn on grouping in Mission Control to I get the application icon overlaid on the windows that belong to the application. Is there a hidden option to show icons on ungrouped windows?  <answer215458> Apple IconSystem PreferencesMission ControlUnselect "Group windows by applications"  I think it is gonna work.  Edit: I tried, it works.  <comment260258> Welcome to [Apple.SE]! Unfortunately, this doesn't answer the question. I want to know if I can enable icons to show on **ungrouped windows**. <comment315656> Worked for me when I _selected_ that option, instead of unselecting it.
