Some photos aren't displayed when iPhone connected to PC <body> I have an issue where strongwhen I connect my iPhone (6S) to my PC/strong via USB in an attempt to transfer photos, strongonly some photos are displayed/strong in the folders.  This isn't to do with the phone being locked (it isn't) or needing to tap  the em"Trust this computer"/em option on the iPhone when it is connected.  strongSome photos are displayed/strong and I can copy them from the device to my PC, strongbut some, which are clearly displayed in iOS Photos, simply aren't there/strong when I browse the file structure under the em(the phone's name)  Internal Storage  DCIM  100APPLE (etc)/em.  I've tried:  ul liResetting the iPhone/li liRestarting the computer/li liUsing a different USB port/li liConnecting to a different computer/li /ul  I can also see the photos in question on iCloud and I can download them from there, but the reason I want to get them from the iPhone is that I also want the .AAE files.  <answer267843> After much frustration, Googling and trial-and-error, I came to the conclusion that strongthe photos displayed on my phone weren't actually on my phone, but were instead "optimised versions" of photos stored in iCloud/strong and therefore inaccessible through the file structure when connected to my PC.  (It should be noted that the photos did not appear pixelated or blurry in any way in the Photos app on my phone, but the following solution worked which indicates to me that these were "optimised versions"):  ol liNavigate to emSettings  iCloud  Photos/em on the iPhone/li liIf em"Optimise iPhone Storage"/em is selected, you have solved your problem:  this means that some photos appearing on your phone are in fact stored in iCloud/li liSelect the option em"Download and Keep Originals"/em - this will ensure all photos are actually stored on your phone, meaning they will appear when connected to a PC via USB./li /ol  strongNote:/strong You may find that selecting this option results in a message that your phone lacks the necessary capacity to download originals of all your photos. I had to work in stages, allowing my phone to download the originals which I then copied to my PC and deleted from my phone, creating more space for more originals to be downloaded.
