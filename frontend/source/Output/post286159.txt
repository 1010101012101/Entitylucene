PAW: command not found <body> I need to install PAW on my system for some analysis. I am working on a Macintosh system (Sierra), I tried installing it through Homebrew : brew cask install paw . The installation was successful, but when I run the script which calls for using paw to plot some data, I get the following error:  PAW: command not found  Any suggestions how to fix this? Thanks in advance!  <answer286174> PAW may not be in your path. I would first type 'which PAW' and see if it returns with a path to PAW. If it does try using whole path to run PAW or at that directory structure to your path.  Ex. if 'which paw' returns /usr/bin/paw try /usr/bin/paw to run PAW.  Hope this helps.  <comment361016> Thanks for your suggestion. But, when I type "which paw" at the terminal, it dosen't return anything! @john
