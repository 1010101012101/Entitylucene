Clear Clipboard on OS X after 'n' seconds <body> I tab a lot between tasks and would like to make sure that I do not accidentally paste something where it does not belong. Thus, is there a feature or an app that allows me to auto-clear my clipboard after emn/em seconds or after having pasted emn/em times?  <comment302066> You can use an AppleScrip _command_ `set the clipboard to ""` or from the Command Line, `printf "" | pbcopy` used in this manner will copy nothing thus overriding the general pasteboard (clipboard). Either can be used in Automator to make an App or Service, the latter of which could have a keyboard shortcut assigned. Or in an AppleScript App you could put in the Dock to click when you'd like, etc.
