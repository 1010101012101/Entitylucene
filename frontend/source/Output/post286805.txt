Create camera filter/overlay that can be used when taking photos on iphone or ipad <body> At my work, we have field teams that use the ESRI collector app to create survey points, add photos, etc.  We have a set protocol for taking 6 photos, from certain set sites in the survey area, in a set order. When adding the photos, so that we know the order in which Our field team collected them, we ask that we add them in the order in which the took them.  So, photo 1 on the ESRI app is the same as photo 1 in the protocol, and so on.    This used to mean that people would take the 1st photo, and load it, take the 2nd, and load it, and so on.  People have now moved onto to taking all 6 photos, outside of the ESRI Collector app, using the normal camera, and then loading them 1-6 in one go into the ESRI Collector app.    We have a concern here that the exact order might be forgotten sometimes, so we have been trying to figure out if there is a way create a custom filter for the camera (or identify an app that allows custom filters/overlays) where for each photo, we can add text to the upper right hand corner specifying the:  ol lidate/li lisurvey site ID/li lipicture ID number (1-6)/li /ol  Does anyone know of an app or a method easily overlaying this info at the time of taking the photo, using an ipad or iphone?
