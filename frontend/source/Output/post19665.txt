How can I share one Mac's VPN with another mac? <body> I've upgraded my iMac to Lion and that broke my VPN to work (Check Point's Connectra SNX--it's browser-based, so it does not use OS X built-in VPN). Long story short, until there's a fix, I want to share my MacBook Pro's VPN connection (still running Snow Leopard with VPN working) with my iMac.  I have the iMac connected to the MBP via ethernet and can share the MBP's internet connection with no problem. However, the iMac's internet traffic is not funneled into the VPN.  I've tried many hints, but none seem to work for me.  Using ifconfig, I see that the VPN creates and uses en7 for its traffic.  ifconfig before starting the VPN:  precodelo0: flags=8049&lt;UP,LOOPBACK,RUNNING,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 16384 inet6 ::1 prefixlen 128  inet6 fe80::1%lo0 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x1  inet 127.0.0.1 netmask 0xff000000  inet6 fdde:8fdc:2714:603c:217:f2ff:fec5:5844 prefixlen 128   gif0: flags=8010&lt;POINTOPOINT,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1280  stf0: flags=0&lt;&gt; mtu 1280  en0: flags=8863&lt;UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500 ether 00:17:f2:c5:58:44  inet 192.168.2.1 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.2.255 media: autoselect status: inactive  fw0: flags=8863&lt;UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 2030 lladdr 00:17:f2:ff:fe:8d:62:00  media: autoselect &lt;full-duplex&gt; status: inactive  en1: flags=8863&lt;UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500 ether 00:17:f2:e6:e1:df  inet6 fe80::217:f2ff:fee6:e1df%en1 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x6  inet 10.0.1.6 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 10.0.1.255 media: autoselect status: active /code/pre  And after starting the VPN:  precodelo0: flags=8049&lt;UP,LOOPBACK,RUNNING,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 16384 inet6 ::1 prefixlen 128  inet6 fe80::1%lo0 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x1  inet 127.0.0.1 netmask 0xff000000  inet6 fdde:8fdc:2714:603c:217:f2ff:fec5:5844 prefixlen 128   gif0: flags=8010&lt;POINTOPOINT,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1280  stf0: flags=0&lt;&gt; mtu 1280  en0: flags=8863&lt;UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500 ether 00:17:f2:c5:58:44  inet 192.168.2.1 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.2.255 media: autoselect status: inactive  fw0: flags=8863&lt;UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 2030 lladdr 00:17:f2:ff:fe:8d:62:00  media: autoselect &lt;full-duplex&gt; status: inactive  en1: flags=8863&lt;UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500 ether 00:17:f2:e6:e1:df  inet6 fe80::217:f2ff:fee6:e1df%en1 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x6  inet 10.0.1.6 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 10.0.1.255 media: autoselect status: active  en7: flags=8863&lt;UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1350 ether 54:55:43:44:52:00  inet 10.158.60.108 netmask 0xfffffc00 broadcast XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX Check Point Virtual Network Adapter /code/pre  And we see en7 is new.  I then followed an example and attempted the following (all with sudo):  precodenatd -interface en7 ipfw -f flush ipfw add divert natd ip from any to any via en7 ipfw add pass all from any to any /code/pre  I already have IP Forwarding set to 1 in the conf file.  Whenever I issue the natd -interface en7 command (via sudo), I get the following:  precodenatd: Unable to bind divert socket.: Address already in use /code/pre  This occurs with all interfaces.  Does anyone know what I'm doing wrong and would anyone be able to walk me through this?  Any and all help would be greatly appreciated!  Thanks! james  <comment21782> James - is your VPN using L2TP? If so, you can't use level 3 network routing commands to get around a level 2 pipe. Your VPN policy likely prevents what you ask. <comment21824> As far as I know, it is not using L2TP...at least not through OS X' built-in VPN.
