Notification center does not open <body> Ever since upgrading to Yosemite 2 days ago my notifications no longer work. I can't even open the notification center by clicking the icon in the menubar. Nothing happens when i click it.  Anyone know what's going on or where to look to further investigate the issue?  <answer152411> I had the same problem and found an answer on this site. Did you ever use Terminal to disable Notification Center in and earlier OS? I did, and this tip brought it back - How do I re-enable Notification Center in Yosemite or El Capitan post-upgrade?  <comment179198> Perhaps this command : launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.notificationcenterui.plist <comment179769> That did it! perfect, thank you! <comment179863> Thanks to http://apple.stackexchange.com/users/95661/mehmenmike for the original discovery.
