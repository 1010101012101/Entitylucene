Dock Folder Stack - I want ascending order <body> Before I upgraded to OS X Lion, when I click a stack, it would show the very top. Now, it shows the very bottom of the menu meaning you would see the "Open in Finder" option after you click it. Now, I sorted my download folder by "Date Added" and its very annoying that I am seeing the oldest files first rather than the newest ones. I would have to scroll all the way to the top to access the new files. How can I have the newer files be shown first aka ascending order?  <answer20466> My downloads folder is a stack with latest downloads appearing at the top without me having to move the slider. When I 'right' click the downloads folder icon in the dock, a contextual menu appears.  <answer21663> I had mine set to List as well and noticed the problem right away after upgrade (my Downloads folder is huge).   I think this is a bug. The grid view has the correct initial position (at the top of the reverse chronological ordering)  I suspect we'll need to switch to grid view until a patch comes along. :(  <answer21755> In my Downloads stack I don't have this problem. The ordering is correct, i.e. latest download appears at the bottom.  The settings which achieve this are:  Sort by: strongDate Added/strong  Display as: strongStack/strong  View content as: strongFan/strong  I hope these settings work for you too.  <answer69098> Try this in the Terminal:  precodedefaults write com.apple.dock use-new-list-stack -bool YES /code/pre  This gives you another type of List view that always starts at the top of the list with the latest files. You can scroll down for earlier files.  <answer130136> I see this when I have the "list" setting.  A work around is to press control-commnd-up arrow and this will bring you to the top of the list.  <comment22621> You have yours at automatic, but I use list because sometimes the filenames are long and its more convenient for me to see it all in one go. <comment23918> When I switch to List view I have exactly the problem you mention, so this is clearly a Lion bug. Hopefully fixed in 10.7.1. For the short term, Fan is a good work around. <comment25068> I submitted this as a bug - RADAR ID 9982917 <comment25069> I'm also running 10.7.2 and the same issue exists. I'll update (when I hear back) if this is a known issue. <comment34182> Too bad we can't get List to work in descending order. Come on Apple! <comment100397> I think he's looking for the reverse, latest files at the bottom of the list. <comment101931> I reproduced you problem on Mountain Lion 10.8.3, never noticed the problem because I always use fan view. <comment102056> Re http://secrets.blacktree.com/?search=stack if you show the RecentÂ Applications stack as a list, how is it ordered? Consider adding detail to the question. <comment102108> Workaround: Press the Home button when you open it to scroll to the top.
