Why do I sometimes see a downloading 'pie' icon when viewing photostream photos? <body> it normally shows in the bottom corner as a sort of 'pie' that fills up as the picture is downloaded, similar to the 'app downloading' pie when viewing a downloading app on the home page/s  prior to this the picture resolution is terrible  <answer184558> That device has only a thumbnail and is indicating the progress fetching a higher resolution image.  From Apple KB - My Photo Stream FAQ     strongWhat resolution are My Photo Stream photos?/strong        On a Mac or PC, your photos are downloaded and stored in full resolution. On iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, and Apple TV, your photos are delivered in a device-optimized resolution that speeds downloads and saves storage space. Dimensions will vary, but an optimized version of a photo taken by a standard point-and-shoot camera will have a 2048 x 1536 pixel resolution when pushed to your devices. Panoramic photos can be up to 5400 pixels wide.   <comment218858> This is odd as it also happened when I was roaming but I have data roaming turned off and was not connected to wifi at the time <comment218862> I'm not fully au fait with how the new Photos structure works - there is a possibility it had the full image already & was taking its time thinking about fetching it. I'm not really sure if/how it would make that distinction. Perhaps it tried to fetch, found it couldn't, then instead fully fetched its perhaps half-res cached version instead - which wouldn't be noticeable on a phone. [as you can tell, I'm guessing a bit ;) <comment218895> It always shows the pie. Even if you aren't connected to a network. Once it figures out that it doesn't have a network connection, it will just show a ! inside the pie.
