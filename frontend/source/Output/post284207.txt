Making audio calls on iPhone via Automator in macOS Sierra <body> I was using this script by Evan Carmi to make audio calls via my Mac:  precodeon run {input, parameters}   open location "tel://" &amp; input &amp; "?audio=yes"   return input end run /code/pre  This worked great until I recently updated my Mac to macOS Sierra 10.12.5. Now it returns an error (popup window that says "the action run applescript encountered an error"). The script allows any number to be called from any application (see this).   Does anyone know how to update this script so that it works on macOS Sierra 10.12.5?  <answer295785> This works for me on the latest version of Sierra    precodeset input to "0123456789" -- input real phone number     open location "tel://" &amp; input &amp; "?audio=yes"     delay 1     tell application "System Events"         key code 36 end tell /code/pre  <comment358422> What error does it return? Add the error message to your question using the edit link. <comment358429> The error is just a popup window that says "the action run applescript encountered an error".  Won't let me add another link in the question above nor can i attach an image.  link to image :  http://www.real-estate-agent-sunshine-coast.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Untitled.jpeg
