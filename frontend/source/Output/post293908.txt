Minimized windows in one workspace don't disappear when changing to another workspace <body> I know about the solution here: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/101613/89701  But all this does is make it so that when you unminimize a window which belongs to another workspace, it unminimizes in that workspace without also switching you to the workspace it belongs to.  But the appropriate functionality would be for these minimized windows not to appear at all in a different workspace, I want my workspaces to be completely seperate, it doesn't make any sense for a window to stick around taking up dock realestate just because it's been minimized.  <comment371897> (I believe the appropriate word is maximize, by the way.) By workspace, you mean the different desktops in mission control? And I'm not exactly clear on what functionality that question isn't helping with. You click on an active app that's minimized...and what? Where does it open into? <comment371902> @DonielF, yes the different desktops, if you minimize a window into the dock in one desktop, it doesn't disappear when you go to a different desktop.  Try it. <comment371903> I think that’s by design. If you don’t want it taking up dock real estate, as you put it, have the windows minimize into their respective apps. I think you should probably edit to make that point a little clearer - if that’s what you had in mind, the question you link to is completely unrelated.
