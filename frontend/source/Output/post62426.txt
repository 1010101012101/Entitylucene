Is it possible to tame the change notifications each reboot from Mountain Lion Server? <body> I have Server.app installed on 10.8.1. The only service that is configured is file sharing. No DNS, no OD. After every single reboot I get a push notification and email with the following:     Network change notification for computername      The host name of uptown has changed to computername.local. Some services may not work correctly until they have been updated to use the new configuration.   The hostname has not changed. I logged in as an admin and set the hostname with codedscl --set HostName/code and the issue persists. Any ideas?  <comment72881> I don't have a solution, but my MacBook Pro running OS X 10.8.1 Server does exactly the same thing. I went and had lunch earlier, came back and had multiple email messages like this. Annoying, to say the least. <comment72882> I hv tried using changeip to change the hostname, and I thought it would be a permanent change. But the issue still persists. Can you try this to see whether it will fix for u? https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3360452?start=0&tstart=0 <comment72883> Confirmed that using changeip does not resolve the issue. The command runs and returns as expected but the issue persists.
