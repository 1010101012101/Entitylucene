Project folder not visible in Sublime Text 2 after relaunching app <body> When I add a new project folder to Sublime Text 2â€¦  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MsZUV.png" alt="Screenshot"  It works normally. But when I quit and relaunch the application I can't see my project folder on the sidebar?   What should I do?  <answer128146> Adding folders to projects or otherwise changing projects will be retained for as long as the instance of the app is open. Your changes will be lost when the app is quit unless you strongsave the project/strong.  <comment150100> Have you tried saving the project? (Save Project As...) <comment150113> yes. it worked. thanks a lot.
