Global Fn ctrl F2? <body> From the Finder Fn+ctrl+F2 select the Apple Menu icon. Is there a way to make this keyboard kung fu global so that I can use it from within all the apps to get to the Apple icon in the menu bar?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8rQ8k.png" alt="enter image description here"  -------EDIT    Per timothymh's comment, these are the apps in my menu bar: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/taWAt.png" alt="enter image description here"  ul liScreenHero      &lt;--- Launching this seems to be the culprit?/li liPostgres.app/li liBlueTooth/li liGoogleDrive/li liWireless/li liAppleTV/li liKeyboard Input/li liBattery/li liSpotlight/li liDate/Time/li liSiri/li liNotifications/li /ul  <answer268007> Per this answer I might also be hitting Fn+ctrl+F1 img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bSKDE.png" alt="System Preferences &gt; Keyboard :: Shortcuts" I'll try turning off keyboard access... toggling Fn+ctrl+F1 deselects the Fn+ctrl+F2 option. Ta da!  <comment336320> It should be global unless ctrl-F2 is a shortcut in the app you're using. When does it *not* work? <comment336326> @timothymh that's what I thought - seems to only work from the Finder <comment336340> Do you have anything installed that might be capturing your hotkey? Most often this would be a menu bar application of some sort, are you running any of those? <comment336379> If something else is stealing it, ctrl/shift/F2 [+Fn depending on how your f-keys are set] should do the same thing.
