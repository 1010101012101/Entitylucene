TextWrangler always comes to front when switching monitors <body> I have a late 2012 mac mini running OSX 10.9.3 and I'm curious if there is a setting that needs to be changed or if this is some sort of bug. I'm working with two monitors; one plugged into HDMI and the other using the display port with a VGA adapter.   Regardless of which application I am using on my VGA monitor, when I switch to the HDMI monitor by clicking into an application, TextWrangler comes to the front. I've searched through system settings and TextWrangler settings, but I couldn't find anything to fix this problem.  This is incredibly irritating and I'd appreciate any help.   <answer133170> Quitting TextWrangler and re-opening it fixed the problem.  <answer143797> If you are using the command line tools where you open it with  precodeedit yourfile.txt /code/pre  Then there is a flag you can use to open it in the background. You can defualt this via an alias in your .bash_profile or .cshrc  The flag is:  precodeedit -b /code/pre  The .bash_profle alias would look like:  precodealias edit='edit -b' /code/pre  <comment157790> If you quit TextWrangler does it work normally? <comment157791> Yes, this problem seems to only happen with TextWrangler. <comment157792> Well now that I've quit and re-opened the program, it stopped coming to the front. I don't know what could have caused it, but it's back to normal now. <comment157794> So killing the application and re-opening did the trick? You should consider writing this as answer, maybe others have the same issue with an application popping up.
