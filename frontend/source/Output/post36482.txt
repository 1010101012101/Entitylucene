Backup Disk Not Available - Time Capsule <body> After working fine for months, my wifi Time Capsule backups fail, returning a "back-up disk not available" message.  Time Capsule light is green, Airport Utility reveals no problems.  What do I do?  Thanks.  <answer36524> I see this every few months and all other features of the device seem to work fine when it happens. The short answer is a restart has always fixed it for me, either from the Airport Utility or if you must by cycling the power.  <answer36538> Try changing the TC disk name. Worked for me.   <answer57878> Are you connected to the 5ghz wifi or the normal wifi ?  I had the exact same problem you describe, Airport Utility showed nothing wrong, green lights across the board, but when trying to do a Time Machine backup, it wouldn't be able to find the disk.  Additionally, I was also unable to access the Time Capsule's disk through Finder. It shows up alright, but I could not connect.  Manually switching wifi network to the non-5ghz one solved both the backup and Finder problems.
