fs_usage returns a LOT of ioctl lines <body> I've been reading up on interesting Terminal commands (I've used it forever, but there's always more to learn) when I ran across this. I ran codesudo fs_usage/code and got a whole lot of this:  precode... 13:39:09  ioctl                   0.000019   WindowServer 13:39:09  ioctl                   0.000017   WindowServer 13:39:09  ioctl                   0.000020   WindowServer 13:39:09  ioctl                   0.000018   WindowServer ... /code/pre  I figure, if I ever actually need to use this, it would be nice to have a way not only to filter out filesystem activity related to the WindowServer, in particular, but other processes as well. It would also be nice to specify a service or process for which to return information.  Have I misread the usefulness of this function? Is there a way to get rid of those numerous WindowServer calls? Can I specify the processes in which I'm interested?  <answer196602> All that is possible by using fs_usage with several options. You may also pipe it to grep to further restrict the output.  To exclude a process or a pid (and also fs_usage itself) use the -e option:  precodesudo fs_usage -e WindowsServer sudo fs_usage -e 123 /code/pre  Specifying the -f option turns on output filtering based on the mode provided. The possible modes are:    precodenetwork    Network-related events are displayed.   filesys    Filesystem-related events are displayed.   pathname   Pathname-related events are displayed.   exec       Exec and spawn events are displayed.   diskio     Disk I/O events are displayed.   cachehit   In addition, show cache hits.   /code/pre  Example:   precodesudo fs_usage -e WindowsServer -f filesys /code/pre  To just show a special pid/command and exclude all other, use the pid (enter codeps aux/code to get it) or the name of the command or application  Examples:  precodesudo fs_usage -f filesys Terminal sudo fs_usage -f filesys 178 /code/pre  A different possibility is to pipe the output of fs_usage to grep:  precodesudo fs_usage -e -f filesys|grep Terminal sudo fs_usage -e -f filesys|grep -v grep|grep write sudo fs_usage -e|grep -v grep|grep -v WindowsServer|grep ioctl /code/pre  The part codegrep -v grep/code or codegrep -v WindowsServer/code excludes "grep" and/or "WindowsServer" from occurring in the result.
