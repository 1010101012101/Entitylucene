iCloud is full, but no way to delete photos/backups anything <body> i got an email that my iCloud was full. I went into phone settings and noticed that a lot of things i previously disabled were now enabled so i disabled them again ( backups, photos)   it seems that disabling it did not remove anything from iCloud because it's still full.   i logged into iCloud.com and i can see my storage is full but i can't find any way to delete my existing stuff.   <answer273863> this is so confusing! even if i turned off all the services that still didn't do anything.   i finally found it.      settings  icloud  storage  manage storage  start turning **** off and it will actually delete on iCloud.    it was storing all kinds of things i never authorized! like "health data" podcasts, photos.. this really sucks.   <comment344256> Try to delete your iCloud backup. Do a backup via iTunes. Try on your iPhone: Settings - General - Storage- & iCloud usage - Manage storage - See your backup? Choose it. Scroll down. Press delete Backup and confirm. Now move back and delete those data you don't need (Documents & data). The next time you get an iCloud backup you should be all set.
