Using lsof to find which process is connected to a unix file socket <body> I have a server application that binds a unix file socket on code/var/run/appsocket/code.  I have multiple clients which connect to this unix file socket, and I want to be able to determine which PID is connected to this unix file socket.  strongWhat I've tried:/strong  precodesudo lsof /var/run/appsocket /code/pre  Displays the following:     appserver 101 appuser    6u  unix 0x5d3497ad372af941      0t0      /var/run/appsocket      appserver 101 appuser    9u  unix 0x5d3497ad3aa380a9      0t0      /var/run/appsocket   This displays which process created the unix file socket, but not the one who is using it. If I list open files by my app client, I see that it is using the file handle 0x5d3497ad372af941 (from the list above).  I've tried using several solutions from here, but nothing worked.  I'm using lsof 4.89 and code-E/code is not supported for some reason.  How can I make this connection between the file handle and the process which opened it?  strongEDIT/strong  precodesudo lsof /var/run/appsocket | awk '{print $6}' | uniq | xargs -I {} sh -c "sudo lsof -U | grep {}" | awk '{print $1}' | uniq /code/pre  Does the trick, but is not optimal whatsoever...  <comment339229> Try netstat, that does socket connections too
