Standalone Flash player app for swf -files <body> I use nowadays Opera because it just works for these swf -files.  No other browser work.   However, the problem with Opera is that it is big.   strongIs there any tool by which you can just view SWF -files?/strong  <answer162987> Did you already visit Adobe?  Adobe provides a standalone Flash Player: Flash Player Projector 16.0. Additional also debugger versions are available as well as older versions.   Originally it was meant for Flex and Flash developers.
