"File>Open Recent" shows different documents with the app history document (right click menu) <body> While using MPlayerX, I see different documents in "FileOpen Recent" menu with what I see when I right click on the app icon.   The correct list of recent documents is the one that is listed under "File  Open Recent" menu of the app. File listed in the right-click menu on the app icon are from a few weeks ago. Is this a bug in the app or there is something wrong with Finder?
