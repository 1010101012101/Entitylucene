Can't receive ICMP echo replies from outside of local network in El Capitan <body> I'm observing the weirdest thing.  I can't receive any ICMP echo replies from hosts outside of my local network on my MacBook running El Capitan. Pinging hosts within my local network (my router and my Thinkpad running Arch Linux) works fine.  Also pinging hosts in the internet from the Thinkpad and from the iPhone (with mobile data switched off to make sure it has to go through the same wifi router the MacBook uses) works fine.  So on the one hand I can rule out an issue with the MacBook (because it does receive replies from hosts in the same network) and I can rule out an issue with the router because devices using the very same router don't have any problem receiving ICMP echo replies.  That leaves me thoroughly puzzled and I don't have any idea where to look for the cause of this.  Here's some terminal output to illustrate what I'm talking about (the first ping is the router, the second one is the Thinkpad):  precode$ ping 192.168.1.1 PING 192.168.1.1 (192.168.1.1): 56 data bytes 64 bytes from 192.168.1.1: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=2.948 ms 64 bytes from 192.168.1.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=3.577 ms 64 bytes from 192.168.1.1: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=4.635 ms ^C --- 192.168.1.1 ping statistics --- 3 packets transmitted, 3 packets received, 0.0% packet loss round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 2.948/3.720/4.635/0.696 ms $ ping 192.168.1.13 PING 192.168.1.13 (192.168.1.13): 56 data bytes 64 bytes from 192.168.1.13: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=38.395 ms 64 bytes from 192.168.1.13: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=57.454 ms 64 bytes from 192.168.1.13: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=48.238 ms ^C --- 192.168.1.13 ping statistics --- 3 packets transmitted, 3 packets received, 0.0% packet loss round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 38.395/48.029/57.454/7.782 ms $ ping google.com PING google.com (216.58.213.14): 56 data bytes Request timeout for icmp_seq 0 Request timeout for icmp_seq 1 Request timeout for icmp_seq 2 ^C /code/pre  I did try to switch off OS X's firewall. Makes no difference.  Any hints and suggestions on how to get the bottom of this would be greatly appreciated.
