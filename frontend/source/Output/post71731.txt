Where is USB -stick automounted in OSX? Not /media/usb/something like in Ubuntu <body> Ubuntu automounts USB -fs to code/media/usb/something/code. How is this in OSX? I cannot find anything in /media below.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oFNxv.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer71733> All volumes (CDs, USB, harddrives, etc) are mounted into /Volumes.  After inserting a USB stick called strongUSB/strong I see the following:  precodealex@smiley:/Volumes|â‡’  ls -lrt total 8 drwxrwxr-t  30 alex  staff  1088 Aug  4 14:34 USB drwx------   1 root  wheel   568 Aug  4 23:59 Family Backup drwxr-xr-x   6 root  wheel   340 Aug  5 00:00 Time Machine Backups lrwxr-xr-x   1 root  admin     1 Nov 14 20:55 System -&gt; / drwxr-xr-x  39 root  wheel  1394 Nov 14 20:57 SmileyBackup /code/pre  In addition there you can see that my main drive is strongSystem/strong. OS X creates a link to / for it automatically.  Also, strongSmiley Backup/strong is another disk, and strongTime Machine Backups/strong is a TimeMachine volume, and strongFamily Backup/strong is a remote shared drive I've mounted from another system.  <answer71740> As already mentioned, you can view almost all mounted devices in code/Volumes/code.  Although, the newer iOS devices do not show up there.  Alternatively, you can use codediskutil/code (which does not require superuser access.)  precode$ diskutil list /code/pre  If you want more details on a specific mounted device you might try:  precode$ diskutil info [diskname] /code/pre
