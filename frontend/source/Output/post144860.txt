Why can't I install Python-Markdown? <body> I've had some weird issues with my python install recently but I've usually been able to get it working. However I'm running into a really bizarre issue right now where pip is installing things that disappear. Trying to run through this blog post.    In the terminal:  precodepip install markdown  /code/pre  Everything installs correctly.   precodepython -m markdown testing.md &gt; output.html /code/pre  It pops out the following error code/usr/bin/python: No module named markdown/code which seems bizarre, since I'm running exactly what the tutorial is telling me. Then when I write codepython markdown/code   When I go to run the command codepip install/code again it spits out the following:  precode$ pip install markdown Requirement already satisfied (use --upgrade to upgrade): markdown in /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.4/lib/python3.4/site-packages /code/pre  Any tips on how to troubleshoot this?   <answer144862> I think your copy of Python 3 is not using the executable name "python". Try "python3 -m markdown" and see if that works. If it does, you can symlink python to python3, or just execute python3 when tutorials ask you to run python.  <comment170635> !?!?!?! Well, that's bizarre. I'm checking now. <comment170636> It worked. Hallelujah!
