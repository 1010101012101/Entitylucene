How to re-install iOS SDK in Xcode? <body> Xcode gives me an error when looking for iPhoneOS 8.3 SDK. The path exists in my filesystem but contains only one unrelated file. Xcode tells me I have that version already installed inside codePreferences &gt; Components &gt; Simulators/code.     error: There is no SDK with the name or path '/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneOS8.3.sdk'   The question is how to reinstall the SDK to stop having this error?  <comment303210> Did you tried to clean remove it first with apps like AppCleaner ? <comment303213> I can take a look on it now <comment303214> It's a freeware version of appzapper, removes all sources of apps. <comment303215> The only usage of that app would be to wipe out Xcode completely if that's that you meant. It doesn't understand the Xcode folder structure nor allow adding/removing different SDKs individually. <comment303217> Yup, but as reinstalling a beta is always best to avoid problems. <comment303223> After doing a reinstall the iPhone OS SDK 8.3 still appears as installed. AppCleaner did not delete the file that holds the reference... <comment303231> Delete Xcode and reinstall it. The SDK is available inside the Xcode.app bundle.
