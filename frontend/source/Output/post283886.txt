Apple mail with multiple accounts, sender not correct <body> I have multiple accounts set-up on my iMac.  I'm running the latest OS X Sierra.    When I draft an email I select the account and this updates the sender email address, all is good.  However when I send the email, the email is sent not from the sender that was displayed whilst drafting the email but from the first account in my list.  Why?  Can I fix this or is it a bug?  <answer284057> I posted this same question to the Apple community and yesterday I got an answer which has solved the problem.  https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7956716  <comment358284> What idiot marks down a vote and doesn't post a reason, this facility should be disabled, if you don't post a comment then you can't vote.
