How can I disable overscrolling in OSX Lion? <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   Can you disable rubber-band scrolling in OS X Lion?       I'm really frustrated with the way overscrolling works in Lion. It makes working with flexible web applications quite difficult.  Anyway is there a way to disable the over scroll?  <answer29305> This setting perhaps : img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CKpaj.png" alt="enter image description here" Found in System Preferences = Genral  <comment33621> Just out of curiousity: What kind of flexible web applications are you thinking of here? <comment33623> I already tried it but doesn't disables the overscrolling :( <comment33626> like chrome webstore, wikipedia, reddit etc... <comment33627> Server side or client side?
