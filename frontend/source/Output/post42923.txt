Configure center mouse button to open new links <body> I have a simple Logitech mouse with 2 buttons and central wheel button.  The central button opens some accessories (calculator and so on). I would like this button to open new links in chrome (as it does on Windows and Linux). Is there a way to configure that?  I've tried Logitech control center, but it can't find the attached mouse.  <answer42927> This is not a feature provided by OSX.  ul liIf you want to open a link in a new tab you kbd⌘/kbd+emclick/em the link./li liThis also works with the emURL-bar/em and emsearch box/em using kbd⌘/kbd+kbd&#x21A9;/kbd./li /ul  Knowing this, you can assign the kbd⌘/kbd+emclick/em action to the scrolling wheel click using the free software strongBetterTouchTool/strong.  I've successfully done this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/75tJa.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer58788> You emcan/em set the center mouse button or any other button to open links in a new tab in Logitech Control Center.  Just change the Assigned action of the "Switch Application Button" or "Center Mouse" button to "Advanced click." Under the "Configure Advanced Click" tab, select "click" under click type and select the "⌘" modifier.  Screenshot here  Easy Peasy  <comment48809> Works like a charm. How come this isn't implemented in OSX natively? <comment48810> Dunno. Probably because the only apple device that has a middle mouse button is the magic mouse? <comment82967> Button 3 used to function as a Command-Click. <comment285949> Works perfectly, and you don't have to pay for BetterTouchTool
