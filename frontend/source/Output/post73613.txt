Is there a Mac OSX equivalent of zenity? <body> I'm porting some simple X windows/bash scripts to Mac OSX, but I cannot find a build of Zenity (a Gnome app for basic GUI dialogs) for OSX. Is there some other command line driven dialog utility I can use? Basic operations: notification dialog   ul liList item/li li(i.e. basic title, text, icon, OK button)/li lierror notification/li liyes/no or ok/cancel prompts/li liselect 1 or n items from a list/li liinput text string/li /ul  I don't (yet) know AppleScript (but it seems pretty verbose for the file maintenance tasks I'm interested in).  <answer73614> Check out cocoaDialog:     cocoaDialog is an OS X application that allows the use of common GUI controls such as file selectors, text input, progress bars, yes/no confirmations and more with a command-line application. It requires no knowledge of Cocoa, and is ideal for use in shell and Perl scripts (or Ruby, or Python, or... etc).   It's a pretty simple concept — pass arguments to the executable to create a dialog, and it returns a result string. There are some good examples as well as documentation.  <answer73625> Try also Pashua.     Pashua is a tool for creating native Aqua dialog windows from programming languages that have none or only limi­ted support for graphic user inter­faces on Mac OS X. Currently, it supports Apple­Script, Perl, PHP, Python, Groovy, Rexx, Ruby, shell scripts and Tcl—and if your favourite language is not included in this list: writing the glue code for communicating with Pashua is pretty simple.   <answer169578> Homebrew provides the zenity package. It uses the MacOS X11 server (emulation) Xquartz.  Makes it easier to have cross-OS implementations, but it is not native MacOS X gui.  <answer271358> There is a zenity compatible implemention called qarma, written in qt, which can be compiled on mac os   https://github.com/luebking/qarma/issues/15  <comment149437> +1; Pashua is powerful, but the API style is different from Zenity's in that instead of separate command-line arguments (multi-line) configuration strings describing the desired GUI must be passed. Probably takes longer to get started. <comment149438> +1; `cocoaDialog` is Zenity-like, but (as of April 2014) there's a caveat: the latest stable version is from 2006, the latest beta (rough around the edges) from May 2012. <comment177037> Cocoadialog does not have support for --username and --password like zenity does. Just a note! <comment269070> For those who are interested, `zenity` is available on `x11` tap. Run `brew install homebrew/x11/zenity` to install it.
