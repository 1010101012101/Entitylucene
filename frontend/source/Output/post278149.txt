Where did user 'PostgreSQL' come from? <body> Forgive me for being a little undereducated here, but I'm new to databases in general.  I tried to install Postgres with both codebrew/code and with the native desktop app for OS X/macOS from https://postgresapp.com, I can't remember which was first.  After having issues with the port (5432) being in use and not knowing the password for codecreatedb &lt;mydbname&gt;/code I decided the problem might have come from me trying to install from two different sources so I'm simply going to uninstall and try again.  Now my problem is this - I noticed there's a new user named 'PostgreSQL'. Where did this come from? And is it safe to just delete it?  <comment350064> Possible duplicate of [What is postgres and why is it running on my system?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/97953/what-is-postgres-and-why-is-it-running-on-my-system) <comment350065> If you think it's a duplicate then please explain the connection between the user and the existence of Postgres on mac because, as it stands, it's not very clear
