Where to find a list of iTunes Internet Radio Station URI's? <body> Looking for a source of iTunes Internet Radio Station URI's. Any suggestions?  <answer179241> Assuming you want a source of radio stations that will play through iTunes, SHOUTcast is as good a starting point as any. Go for the .M3U streams, these will open and play in iTunes.   <comment212425> URIs? You mean URLs? <comment212571> Yes. Thank you for the correction. <comment212572> Appreciate the reference to SHOUTcast. Unfortunately, I can't seem to find any .M3U streams on this site. <comment212574> Just click on the "download" icon next to the stream you want to listen to, and you will be presented with three stream options - M3U is in the middle. Just click on M3U and it should open in iTunes - Firefox will initially ask you which application to open it with, iTunes should be the default helper app (I've not tried this with Safari...) ;-)
