How can I send a mail message later? <body> Back in the day, I remember having an e-mail program (perhaps it was Eudora?) that could schedule the sending of mail, so when composing a message, you could set some preference for emwhen/em it would be sent. The message would be composed and queued up, but would not send until the computer was connected to the internet at or after the schedule time.  Is there a way to duplicate this feature in Apple Mail? Specifically, I want to compose a message, but rather than clicking "Send", I click "Delayed send" (either from the Services menu, the AppleScript menu, or, ideally, from an icon magically added to the Mail toolbar, but I don't expect that will be easy to pull ofF). When I do this, I'd get a dialog box asking me when I want to send the message. I enter the information, and the message is queued up and will be sent at the soonest time after the scheduled send time/date when the computer is on and connected.  <answer45607> No promises, because some of the scripts break under OS X 10.7 Lion, but you might find your answer by using Andreas Amann's Mail Scripts which includes      strongSchedule Delivery (Mail)/strong      Allows you to send individual messages at predefined times (this   script uses iCal for scheduling message delivery).   Andreas makes the emsource code/em of his compiled scripts available. You can  download the .dmg  <answer45609> It is possible to achieve this effect using Calendar and Automator:  ol liOpen Automator and create a Calendar Alarm./li liUse the tasks "New mail message" and "Send Outgoing Messages" and customize them as required. (Fig. 1)/li liSave and move the event in Calendar to when you want the message to be sent.

It's not ideal, but works in practice when the sending of a message at the exact moment is worth more to me than uninterrupted sleep (or whatever else might be going on in my life).  <answer127369> There is a plugin for Mail app which name is SendLater:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Qqnhv.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment51982> Is a third-party app or service acceptable? <comment51983> If I can invoke it from Mail and it is installed on my computer (i.e. not mailing a message to some custom address where their server sends it later), sure. <comment51984> Seems like most of us had the same idea. ;-) <comment51985> @afragen True that... <comment55681> Mail Scripts plus energy saver scheduling a start/wake event might be a great combination to ensure the Mac gets up to send your most important message (assuming you might have several queued). <comment55684> Out of curiosity, do you think this is a better idea than setting an iCal alarm that automatically sends the message? If one is already depending on iCal, why not let iCal do all the work? <comment55690> Not at all - if you don't mind the formatting of iCal - that is a far superior answer. I just wanted to put an "outside the box" answer up. <comment70946> Unfortunately, Andreas Amann's Mail Scripts is broken in OS X 10.7. I tried it and it did not work. I wish there was another simple solution that works on 10.7 and now 10.8. <comment87177> I don't know if the specific script will still work, but try [Mail Scripts](http://www.andreasamann.com/MacOSX/Mail_Scripts) from Andreas Amann. There is a _Schedule Delivery_ script that used to create an iCal event that would trigger the message being sent. <comment89053> This would be a great feature, as sometimes you want to send email to oversea clients and have it hit their inbox when they will in fact be at their computers, or to send stuff that gets to offices at the start of business and not buried in the overnight mail.... <comment94123> @manuel does the iCal example that makes up the majority of this work for you. Others have up voted this, so it's likely to work. <comment109414> @bmike the iCal example didn't work for me, but because I skipped one step inside the step! I could easily set it up, but the email wasn't sent on scheduled time. It created the email, but didn't send it. Guess why... But no idea why even keep the mention to Andreas script here! <comment109924> @Cawas If someone was on OS  10.7, it could be useful. <comment109928> @timothymh but it's already in the other answer! :)  also, doesn't this work on OS  10.7? <comment132073> Try http://www.chungwasoft.com/sendlater/    (I'd love to give it as answer, but I only have StackOverflow reputation) <comment216846> bought it and it's worth every penny. <comment294423> They changed name and payment model. Now you pay â‚¬6 per month for MailButler.
