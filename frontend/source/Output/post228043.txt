Delete videos on OS X <body> I have videos taken with Photo on my iPhone  How do I delete them on OS X  I followed this question Deleting photos  Imported to Photos.app, highlight them all and chose delete. I then get a prompt saying they will be deleted from all my devices and confirmed. They are deleted from my Mac but they come back every time I attach my iPhone again i.e. they are not deleted from the device even though OS X says they should be.   <answer228424> Relevant section from the manual: https://support.apple.com/kb/PH21294?viewlocale=en_US&amp;locale=en_US  Summary: you can delete photos/videos through Photos/iCloud (https://icloud.com), but they are not removed immediately. They are moved into a strongRecently Deleted/strong album (like the Trash on your Mac) and deleted automatically later. (They are kept for 40 days so it tales a long time for them to disappear)  Note in Photos.app this is not a normal album but accessible by File-Show Recently Deleted.  You can open the strongRecently Deleted/strong album and delete the videos/photos from there to remove them from the device permanently. Make sure that you have a backup, because you can not undo this operation.  <comment279695> So recently deleted is now empty on the Mac - but I still have videos on the iPhone and they show up as import <comment299462> Do you have "iCloud Photo Library" on your phone turned on?
