Mistakenly removed permissions <body> I have a severe permissions' issue. I hope there are some really clever people out there, who might know how to solve this using the Terminal, expert-level hacking or in some really simple way so I at least can backup my data despite the faulty permissions.  h3This is the cause of the issue/h3  Being a curious person, in Finder I right-clicked my User and hard-drive unit and strongremoved "staff"/strong as well as strongchanged permissions for "everyone"/strong under permissions. After this my Mac (Macbook Pro, 13 ", early 2013, latest version of Yosemite) hung and every time I try to start it up, it gets stuck loading before the login screen.  h3This is what I have tried and all have failed/h3  ol liBooting the faulty computer and letting it be to see if it would finish loading./li liRebooting it with cmd+r, entering disk utility, repairing permissions.

Boot into the recovery system by pressing kbdCmd-R/kbd on system startup and the proceed with installing the OS. This will (unless something goes very wrong) not impact your existing data  After that, you will at least have a system which boots again. What still needs to be done (and which may turn out to be a rather cumbersome process) is to fix permissions for all non-standard applications and their support/library files. Again, just reinstalling these applications might be the easiest way.  <comment259203> Maybe a manual `chown -R root:wheel /private/var/db/displaypolicyd` in Single User Mode would suffice? <comment259204> Or maybe a `chmod -R 777 /private/var/db/displaypolicyd` as a quick fix? <comment259207> I just had a look: `drwxr-xr-x  2 244  244  68 Sep 17 03:04 /private/var/db/displaypolicyd`... So it's just correct as @MissTricia has it on her hard drive... <comment259211> `displaypolicyd` is not the problem. According to the question the OP changed the permissions on the whole HD. <comment259216> Yes, but the only hint we have is this folder.
