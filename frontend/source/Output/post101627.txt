How can I run a command that requires user input through oh-my-zsh alias? <body> I'm trying to add Reminder.app items through the command line by invoking an alias. I use the Automator workflow solution from this question: How can I add reminders via the command line?, which invokes a basic workflow containing an empty Reminders item, via the following command line input:  precodeautomator -i remindertext add_reminder.workflow /code/pre  This works perfectly, but is clumsy to type, so I want to set an alias for it. My question is: how do I set an alias in .zshrc that allows for me to set the reminder item text when I invoke the alias? It would basically need to be able to replace 'remindertext' with a variable, like so:  precodealias reminder='automator -i &lt;variable&gt; add_reminder.workflow' /code/pre  Is this possible in zsh/oh-my-zsh?  <answer101675> Aliases are used as a shortcuts - sipmple commands that expand to longer ones. If you need to pass an argument to it, you would need to create a function. Maybe try something like:  precodereminder () { automator -i $1 add_reminder.workflow' } /code/pre  Here $1 will expand to the first argument that you've passed to the function. So you'll to do something like:  precodereminder "Buy potatoes" /code/pre  P.S: I haven't tried it, since I don't have zsh with me right now, so if it breaks, give me a shout.  <comment119798> Thanks! This set me in the right direction, with some minor tinkering. I now have this line in my .zshrc file:  `function reminder () {automator -i $1 add_reminder.workflow}`  Works perfectly. <comment119840> Wanted to add that after playing with the syntax a bit, I realized that it also works without adding the 'function' part at the beginning of the line (i.e., it works precisely like Atanas suggested it would with his code) <comment278550> I am trying to type  `weather() { curl -4 http://wttr.in/$1 }` to enable `weather newyork` alias, the original command is `curl -4 http://wttr.in/newyork` <comment278813> @Wongzigii: (1) You've missed ; between $1 and } (2) It's better to use ${1:-newyork}, in this case if you start `weather`, newyork is used by default, and you can specify additional parameters if you want override it; (3) you don't need -4 anymore, it works even so no; (4) I would suggest use `wttr` instead of `weather` for the function name: it's short and unique and it's obvious what it means <comment278837> @IgorChubin Thanks that made the trick.
