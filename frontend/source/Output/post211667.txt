Seperate traffic on wired and wireless interfaces <body> For a specific situation I have configured my network interfaces as follows:  ul liwireless, DHCP getting an IP address from the DHCP server on my network (192.168.1.x range). I want to use this interface to access my network and the Internet (through a gateway also provided by the DHCP server)./li liwired, fixed IP address 10.0.0.1. I connect this to 1 other device through a crossover cable. The other device is configure to use IP address 10.0.0.2./li /ul  Now, I want to be sure that no traffic from the wired connected device makes it out to my wider network on 192.168.1.x. It should not be repeated, routed, broadcasted etc. All traffic between 10.0.0.1 and 10.0.0.2 should stay there.   Can anyone tell me if that is already the case with above setup or do I need to do anything else?  This is OS X Yosemite.  Many thanks
