iPhone won't FaceTime iPad <body> I have an iPhone 6s Plus and it won't let me FaceTime my son's Gmail account that he uses on his iPad Mini. I checked both of our settings and everything looks good. He is signed in to iCloud/Apple ID; I can text him with my iPhone; I also can FaceTime him through my MacBook but just not through my iPhone.  <comment360595> If you go into FaceTime within the Settings app on his iPad is his Gmail address listed under "YOU CAN BE REACHED BY FACETIME AT"? Also maybe check "Blocked" to make sure your iPhone hasn't accidentally been added there.
