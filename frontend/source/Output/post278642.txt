Idle to Blinking Folder <body> Hello I have a Late 2012 Mac Mini with an i5 and 4gb of RAM. It seems like after random amounts of idle/sleep time it will go to a black screen with a blinking white folder and question mark. This problem occurs regardless if someone is logged in or not. I have tried reinstalling macOS multiple times to no avail. Also doing a scan of the hard drive it gives no indication of failure. Has anyone encountered this before?
