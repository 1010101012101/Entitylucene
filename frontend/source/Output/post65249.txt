What format and encoding does iPhone save video clips in? <body> Using the default Photo/Video application. Tried to find any info regarding this on Apple's web site with no success. Does anyone have the specs on this?  <answer65250> h.264 encoded video, AAC audio. Both standards of MPEG 4.  <comment76635> Thanks Jason. I see that the files are saved in .mov instead of the more common .mp4. Is this configurable in any way? <comment76639> No, you canâ€™t change that. <comment76640> Ok. Thanks for clarifying.
