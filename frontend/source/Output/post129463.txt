How do I clear cookies from the Twitter app internal browser on iPhone? <body> Just to clarify, I've tried cleaning the Safari cookies with no success.  <answer129483> I don't believe there is anything you can do sans uninstalling and reinstalling the Twitter app.   Each application that uses the WebView has its own cookie store.  A developer can programmatically remove cookies.  So the Twitter app would need to give you a way to clear cookies which I don't think it does.  <answer294209> Go to advanced settings under safari.   See twitter weasel's data   Swipe left and delete  <answer294210> In the Twitter app, open strongSettings and privacy/strong. As of August 2017 and version 7.4, it is accessed by tapping your profile picture in the top-left corner.  Now go into strongData usage/strong → strongWeb storage/strong and select codeClear all web storage/code. This will delete your Twitter cache, cookies and logins.  That action does not affect pictures, videos and vines attached to Tweets. Instead those are deleted under strongData usage/strong → strongWeb storage/strong → codeClear media storage/code.  <comment371326> We are talking about clearing the internals of the app, not the web version.
