Can I configure Apple Mail so that it does not cache any mails from Googlemail? <body> I'm using Apple Mail on Yosemite with my Gmail account(s). At the moment I have around 10 GB (!!) of mail database locally. Is there a way to use iMail so that it does not cache anything? It would then basically only work if there is any internet connection.  <answer175022> AFAIK, there is no real possibility to disable the caching on mail.   What you could do is: reduce the IMAP folder size directly in Gmail :     Settings  Forwarding and POP/IMAP  Folder Size Limits  Limit IMAP   folders to contain no more than this many messages = 1000   <comment206255> That is one of the reasons why I don't use Apple Mail any more. It seems to have no regard for disk space.
