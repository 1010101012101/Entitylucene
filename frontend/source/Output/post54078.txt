How many monitors can the new retina MacBook Pro handle and at which pixels resolutions?   <body> How many monitors can the new retina MacBook Pro handle and at which pixels resolutions?    e. g. Does it support three cinema displays?  <answer54099> No, the Macbook Pro Retina can support:      Dual display and video mirroring: Simultaneously supports full native resolution on the built-in display and up to 2560 by 1600 pixels strongon up to two/strong external displays, at millions of colors   (emphasis mine)  Source: http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/specs/  strongupdate/strong: It has been dully noted that using the included HDMI connector one can run a third display using a max resolution of 1920 x 1200.  It is important, however, to note that one cannot daisy chain more than two thunderbolt displays (at least according to Apple so far).  <answer54306> The Other World Computing Blog shows that the new MacBook Pro 15" with Retina Display Can Run 3 External Displays:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lWbsg.jpg" alt="MacBook Pro 15 with Retina Display Can Run 3 External Displays"     image source: http://blog.macsales.com/   These resolutions were used:  ul liRetina on laptop @ “best for Retina”/li liiMac used as a display @ 2560 x 1440 via Thunderbolt/li liiMac used as a display @ 2560 x 1440 via Thunderbolt/DisplayPort/li liLG monitor @ 1920 x 1200  via HDMI/li /ul  Quote from the MacRumors news article on that:     This makes the Retina MacBook Pro the first Mac -- other than a tower-based workstation like the Mac Pro -- to natively power four displays simultaneously.   <answer145451> It would appear that when using 60Hz 4K and display port MST on my late 2013 MBP, the "MST" feature actually consumes emboth/em displayport connectors into a single cable.  So when I enable MST, the second displayport connector goes dead. I have not tried the HDMI connector yet.  <comment66899> for your info, my mac mini is supposed to be able to have 2 thunderbolt displays, but it works once every month. so what it is supposed to do and what it really does.... cf the faulty dual-DVI adapter that apple still sells. it is totally bugged. everyone knows about it. they still sell it like nothing happens... <comment171595> I have now verified with HDMI too; at 60Hz 4K only one *single* display can be connected to my late 2013 15" MBP. The internal retina screen works while the 4K screen is connected. So make your 4K screen large enough :)
