Reduce quality in Netflix for iPhone? <body> My 3G can't seem to handle Netflix streaming; it stops to buffer constantly.   The quality seems to be way too high -- it seems to be trying to do HD, without the connection for it.   Is there a way to lower the quality, down to maybe YouTube-level, so I can actually stream anything?  <answer75795> Yes, Since a lot of providers have bandwidth caps, Netflix has put in a downgrade quality option to manage video quality.  Login to netflix first, then go to https://account.netflix.com/HdToggle  Select from  ul liGood Quality.  up to 0.3 GB per hour. /li liBetter Quality.  Up to 0.7 GB per hour. /li liBest Quality.  Up to 1 GB per hour, or 2.3 GB per hour for HD./li /ul  <comment198791> This works...ish There's no option to select the downgrade just for your phone. It will downgrade ALL your netflix streaming.
