Missing icons in apps menu <body> Today I found out that something strange is happening to my Mac OS apps. For example - Disk Utility.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uOlNF.png" alt="Where are icons?"  The same is with my Finder.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/M2cbb.png" alt=":("  What kind of sorcery is this and what should I do now?  <answer89458> The same thing kept happening to me in an earlier version of 10.8, but it stopped after I reinstalled OS X from the recovery partition.  The UI doesn't make it very clear, but the Reinstall Mac OS X option just does an upgrade install or repairs the current installation. I have done it twice so far and it fixed multiple issues both times. Just upgrading to 10.9 might also have the same effect.  <comment105037> Reinstallation is my only hope? Damn. <comment105143> You might try Disk Utilities/Repair Disk Permissions, in case somehow the permissions on the graphics files are wrong.
