Safari / Keychain - Secure login no longer asking for certificate <body> Running Mountain Lion and Safari.  Usually when I login to Barclays, I click "Login" then select my appropriate certificate.  Now, it just jumps straight to the access denied page and no longer pops up and asks me which certificate I want to us.  Any ideas?  <comment120187> What do you mean by certificate? <comment120188> When clicking on the login link, a popup window would appear - I believe Keychain - listing secure certificates.  I would select the one I needed, click "allow", then login. <comment120191> That seems wrong either way - when I go to https://bank.barclays.co.uk/olb/auth/LoginLink.action I see neither but I do not have a Barclays's account <comment120192> Barclays Bank has *never* asked me for *any* certificate when I log in to my accountâ€¦ <comment120201> There are no certificates with Banking accounts. They mean nothing anyway and do not provide any safety. Better double check where you logging in (the link). And show us the said certificate (without your personal information) <comment120203> Check these instructions https://www.barclays.es/publico/contents/comunes/problemasAccesoBarclaysNet.jsp?lang=en_UK&origen=
