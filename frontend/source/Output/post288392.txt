Big file folder icon at the center of the screen when tried macOS high Sierra public beta <body> Today, the long-waited macOS high Sierra was finally arrived. I  can’t help trying it after downloading it for several hours. But out of my expectation, the updating is stuck during the process of rebooting system. The a big file folder appeared at the center of the dark screen(see attached pictures). It popped out every 2 seconds. Very annoying!  I tried to turn off my MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015) and the problem persisted. How should I do it?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5mP2b.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AIPaW.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment364175> Did you try recovery mode? <comment364176> How to do it?

I tired both <comment364184> Then you need a USB or an external HD/SSD you can boot from, or take it to an Apple Store. Your Time Machine drive ought to be bootable. <comment364187> Oh. Understand. Will bring it to the Apple store
