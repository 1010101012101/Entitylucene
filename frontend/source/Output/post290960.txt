App for simple drawing (like Inkscape) <body> I am looking for an app for drawing in Mac. Not too sophisticated. I want to use it for:  1) Edit PDF/SVG, since I usually export PDFs/SVGs from other software and then do small edits, like joining several pieces and so on. All of this without losing the scalability of the graphics.  2) Simple diagramming, like drawing small networks, arrows, text, etc.  3) Easy to arrange and align content. Sometimes I need to edit the exact coordinates of points.
