How to open .CSV file with Microsoft Excel? <body> I was told that I could open a .CSV file with Excel. However, my Microsoft Excel refuses to recognize the file.  I have tried my different ways to open it in Excel but the program didn't give me a choice to click the file open.  I am using Mac 10.4 and the Excel version is Microsoft Excel X for Mac.  <answer23226> Assuming you have a valid/consistent CSV file, create a new workbook and then choose File - Import.  The first option on the list is "CSV file":  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fctq2.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer63888> Here's a way to force any app to open any document :   ol liMake sure your Dock is visible./li liSelect your .csv file in the Finder/li liGrab it with your mouse and move it over the Excel icon in the Dock. Do not release the mouse button./li liHold the Command and the Alt key on your keyboard/li liRelease the mouse button./li /ol  <comment25921> Since CSV (comma-separated value) files are plain text, it might be worth trying to open it in TextEdit first, to make sure you really are dealing with a CSV file. <comment26230> Thank you for your answer. I appreciate it. However I checked my Excel, there is no Export function anywhere, including the File tab. Please could you advise me again. <comment27789> Sorry, not familiar with the old version of Office for OS X.  Mine is 2008. <comment73885> @FandW - the answer was to use **Import** not export <comment73886> Can you choose the file in Finder and then Open it (and what does Open With..) show? <comment284696> They changed the program so that it requires the file to have a '.csv' extension.
