How to use f11 on a Mac <body> I'm playing a game called fishing planet and I need to use f11 to change the pitch but it's the volume so I can't use it   <answer218581> System Preferences  Keyboard  Shortcuts  Locate "F11" and uncheck it for Show Desktop (or whatever its set as)  <answer218582> Hit the Fn key at the bottom left along with F11. Alternatively, in System Preferences, you can set the F keys to be used as F keys and not as volume etc., so then you won't need to press the Fn key every time.  <answer218586> The function keys on a mac have certain functions like volume, Expose, etc. Instead, you need the kbdFn/kbd key to press. so kbdFn/kbd+kbdF11/kbd. On a windows on the other hand, you would use the function key for the F keys functions.  You can do such thing on a mac too in strongSystem Preferences/strong  strongKeyboard/strong  Use F1, F2, etc. as standard function keys.  Doing the above will make F11 keys function like on windows. If you need to adjust volume, etc. with this option checked, you use the kbdFn/kbd key for that.  <comment345078> Did any of the answers help?
