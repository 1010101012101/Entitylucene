What is the function of "Last import" in Address Book? <body> I just made a synchronization through codeiTunes/code of my iPhone onto my MacBookPro.  From memory I made about ten modifications on my iPhone. Unfortunately they are not in the relevant group, but within codeAll Contacts/code.  I thought it will be natural to find them within the group codeLast Import/code. But they aren't there.  Moreover, on a total number of entries of about 600, more than 500 of them are within this codeLast Import/code group.  This is a huge problem: where I'm expecting 10 entries to place in the right group, I'm facing a list of more than 500.  What is the real usefull function of this codeLast Import/code group? What may I did wrong to get such a huge codeLast Import/code. hr I tried to simplify this huge problem by creating a codeNew Smart Groupâ€¦/code based on rule:  precodeCard was updated after Aug 15th 2013 /code/pre  But this smart group is still abnormal: 73 cards where I'm expecting no more than 10.  <answer103538> codeLast Import/code is a group that is expected to contain contacts acquired when you use the strongFile  Import/strong menu item. Since you modified existing contacts on your iPhone, your MBP does not see these contacts as imported, just modified.  Your smart group creation sounds correct. It will locate any contact that has been modified by you or by another program, since the smart group rule is acting on the stronglast modification date/strong property of the person records. For example, if you use your iPhone to add a phone number to an existing contact, that contact has been modified indirectly (outside of the Contacts apps on OS X or iOS). Or if you send an email to a person, Mail might modify the record to change how the name or email address is displayed. Or when your contacts are synced through iCloud, there may be other non-visible changes to your contacts that force an update to the last modification date. So, unfortunately, a strongcard was updated after (date)/strong smart group does not strictly show you contacts that you edited directly, but instead it shows all modified contacts.  Having said all that, I don't have a better solution for you. I think you will need to use the strongcard was updated after (date)/strong smart group rule, and scan through that list of contacts to find the contacts of interest.
