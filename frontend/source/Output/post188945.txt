Why does iTunes fail to sync my iPhone? <body> For the past month or so, I've been unable to backup my iPhone using iTunes.br Every time I try, I'm told that the phone is "disconnected":  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/i9ADM.png" alt="enter image description here"  What could be causing this?br I've tried different USB cables and different USB ports, but the result is always the same.  hr  I'm using OS X 10.10.3, iTunes 12.1.2.27, and iOS 8.3.br The procedure I'm using is the obvious one: launch iTunes; connect the iPhone; choose the iPhone in iTunes; press "Sync".  <answer188949> If you've tried all physical options, removing hubs, changing cables, ports etc, then the remaining likelihood is that the existing backup is corrupt.  Simplest method would be to find your backups folder &amp; rename/delete the corrupt one, then test again…  ul liDisconnect phone, quit iTunes/li liSwitch to Finder/li likbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd N /kbd for new window/li likbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd Shift ⇧ /kbd kbd G /kbd for Go To…/li liCopy/paste code~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup//code &amp; hit kbd Enter ⌅ /kbd or kbd Return⏎ /kbd /li liChange the name of the folder with the long, complex number - just add .bak or something to the end of it.

I had an iPhone with a curved port so it disconnected almost every slight move. <comment224388> This seems to have done the trick! <comment225184> UPDATE: It doesn't work after all. <comment225207> There's always an outside chance of something in the initial backup. Not sure what else to suggest <comment225214> Yeah, who knows. I've deleted all old backups, but that doesn't fix it. Apple's software is getting buggier in general, so I think this is probably just part of that.
