Is there a way to limit Firefox / Chrome RAM usage? <body> I would like to know if there is any kind of setting to limit the RAM browsers can use.  It's annoying that even if you have 30GB of RAM available eventually it will be all used by the browser.  <comment118040> We have a thread here on chrome. http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/95835/5472 I'm not sure you can easily put these browsers in a box with all the helper apps, plug-ins, threads they start. You might need to run a VM if your browsing goes off the rails and really soaks 26 GB of RAM leaving none for the rest of the system.
