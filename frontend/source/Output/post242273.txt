Boot iOS directly into Airplane Mode <body> My phone is switched off and I want to boot into airplane mode directly, without going online for even a split second (so quickly booting and opening control center and tapping airplane isn't an option as I'll be online for a few seconds).  How do I do this? (and no, I don't have a practical Faraday cage or somewhere with no reception available)  <answer242301> You can't do that. You can, however, make it so your phone does not have internet access when it boots.  ol liRemove your iPhone's Sim Card (you can get a sim card remover on Amazon for maybe $3)./li liScan for wifi and ensure no wifi is reachable in case the device is paired with a network. /li liDisable any hotspots (Bluetooth or wifi-based)/li liBoot up your phone normally, and it will have no method to connect to the internet./li /ol  Note that Bluetooth and gps will still be active since you won't be in full airplane mode, so this probably isn't suitable for a plane flight.  Optional: To ensure no pre-existing wifi or Bluetooth connections, perform a factory reset of your phone via iTunes or Apple Configurator or other tool.   <comment297936> May I ask why you can't go online? <comment297949> @IronCraftMan does it matter? <comment297953> Yes. Possibly an [XY Problem](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/66377/what-is-the-xy-problem) <comment297974> @IronCraftMan not really an XY problem as how I got into "non-Airplane mode" is straightforward and irrelevant. anyway, if it *really* matters, my phone is off for various reasons and the moment I turn it on, some other ends will be getting delivery notifications of some messages, which I don't want. if I can safely boot into airplane mode without going online even for a second, then I'll be avoiding that. I've got some completely offline apps music and games that I want to use on my phone, I want to access them. <comment297993> I think I've solved your problem! See my answer below and let me know if it helps. <comment298014> Yep, that would work. It's a shame there's no standard way of doing this. Anyway, thanks. BTW leaving Bluetooth/GPS doesn't have any effect on flight safety, I always leave it on. <comment298026> I did some more research, and I believe you are right about Bluetooth and GPS (I edited my answer, thanks for that). I really wonder how Apple would make a standard way of doing this. A special button for airplane mode boot-ups? Control iPhone even when completely powered off? Anyway, glad I could help. <comment298056> Maybe pressing home button while booting up? Or keep pressing the power button for some extra seconds until bootup. I can't think of another option. It may be useful. <comment324913> There are faraday bags sized to fit phones, which should do the same thing.
