According to Apple, it can drive:     Dual display and video mirroring: simultaneously supports full native resolution on the built-in display and up to strong3840x2160/strong pixels on up to two external displays, both at millions of colours.   Additionally, the HDMI video output van:     Support for 4096x2160 resolution at 24Hz   Will I be able to drive two of these bad boys at native resolution of 2560x1440?  <answer226324> According to Everymacâ€¦     This model supports a simultaneous maximum resolution up to 3840x2160 on two external displays via Thunderbolt 2.
