Simple deletion of files using text file list won't work <body> I have to delete files specified by remove.txt which looks like this:  precode    img_8138.dng.jpg     img_8140.dng.jpg     img_8141.dng.jpg     img_8143.dng.jpg /code/pre  I've tried several suggestions from the web:  codewhile read file; do rm "$file"; done &lt; remove.txt/code  codexargs -rd '\n' --arg-file=remove.txt rm -i --/code  coderm $(cat /Volumes/space1/remove.txt)/code  codexargs rm &lt;remove.txt/code etc  The files are in the current directory some of which are to be deleted (remove.txt). Deletion works if I use rm on the current directory. But using the list I get the error below every time.  coderm: cannot remove ‘img_8147.dng.jpg’: No such file or directory/code  Any ideas what's going wrong?  <answer135675> That error is expected. There is no full path leading to the directory containing the files within coderemove.txt/code. Thus, when you run coderm $(cat /Volumes/space1/remove.txt)/code outside of the directory these files reside in, you get that error.  Simply run:  precodecd /Volumes/space1; rm `cat remove.txt` /code/pre  Or modify the coderemove.txt/code file to include the full path.   <comment160822> Do the lines in the file contain leading or trailing space characters? <comment160905> @patrix There is no leading or trailing space characters. <comment160907> I neglected to mention in my post I had also tried with absolute paths. I checked patrix's suggestion about extra spaces, no luck. Then I tried your version and others I had used yesterday. All trys resulted in that darn error. <comment160909> Can you run your first command (`while` loop) with `do echo rm "$file"; done` and then just copy/paste one of the printed commands into the shell? <comment160950> "I neglected to mention in my post I had also tried with absolute paths." What method did you use when you attempted this? I suggest modifying the original question to include this information for clarification's sake. Cheers. <comment160970> Got it! It works now. Thanks for help all.
