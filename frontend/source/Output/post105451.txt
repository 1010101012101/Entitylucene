"I" and "(","K" keys on the keyboard respond only after pressing them several times <body> "I" and "(", "K" keys on my Bluetooth keyboard don't work very well sometimes I need to press them several times before the input is print.

I've tried to use strongSafe Mode/strong but it continue to happen... How can I fix it?  strongnote that in my keyboard I have to hold on shift to use one of these keys/strong  <comment123966> @grgarside  'm sorry for the mistake!Thanks! <comment123982> Why do you think it is the fault of software, and not of the keyboard? <comment124000> Try another keyboard, that will tell you immediately whether the current one is simply damaged. <comment124039> @TomG Unfortunatly I have non USB keyboard I've tried to use the Keyboard with my tablet and It works perfectly. <comment124041> @GEdgar now I've try with the tablet but I thought if the button doesn't work why it works without shift pressed and if shift doesn't work why it works with the other keys... <comment124069> @GEdgar now doesn't work with the tablet , you was right are there any way to reset the keyboard?
