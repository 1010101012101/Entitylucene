What's the best text editor for use with large files? <body> What are your recommendation for opening large text files on OS X? I found both BBEdit and Textmate to be struggling in this department.  <answer3438> I found strongMacVim/strong pretty good at opening large files.  There's even a plugin to speed it up, if the file is really large.  (If you don't want to compile it yourself, you can download a DMG to install it pre-built.)  <answer3448> BBEdit is pretty much the standard for opening large text files on a Mac. I've opened some good-sized files with it, and BBEdit didn't even break a sweat.  How large of a file are you talking about? And how much RAM does your Mac have (both installed and free)?  hr  subEdited to add…/sub  Bare Bones released BBEdit 9.6 today, and according to the Release Notessup1/sup (under Changes):     It is now possible to open files significantly larger than before; the ceiling isn't unlimited, but it is no longer limited by the previously extant constraints in the OS.   Sounds to me like it's worth upgrading (free for anyone with BBEdit 9.x) and trying again.  subsup1/sup If you've never read a Bare Bones release notice before, you should. Even if you have no interest in BBEdit. Even if you have no interest in Bare Bones. Even if you have no interest in text editors in general. They're that good. Yes, really. emIä! Iä! Pnoies fhtagn!/em/sub  <answer3484> TextWrangler is a great tool for opening editing and saving large files. I wouldn't recommend if for copying and pasting large amounts of content though. Use it if you don't want to have to deal with the vi interface/commands. Like Loic mentioned, MacVim is a great app if you're more familar with vi.  <answer3489> If you are reading the file only, use the 'less' command.  You can navigate and search through the file like vi, but much faster and without the nasty 'line too long' type problems.  For working with big production logs, this is an invaluable tool.  <answer74736> I'm using HexFiend to work with a 60 GB text file and it works great (apparently it can handle files as large as 118 GB).  <answer74758> Check Sublime Text 2 out. It is one of the best out there.   <answer96135> http://code.google.com/p/macvim/ worked with a 1 gig file searching file took about 1 min  <answer108771> If you are dealing with files over 2 GBs I recommend 010 Editor. It won't load the entire file in memory which means you can use it to open files larger than your available RAM and opening times will be much shorter (took about 20 seconds to open a 7GB file).  <answer162481> For me, where BBEdit choked on 750MB, UltraEdit (not free) worked satisfactorily fast.  <comment3126> The command-line version `vim` is already available in Terminal.app. <comment3127> True, but since he talked about BBEdit and Textmate, I assumed he wanted graphical application and not in command-line. <comment3148> there's a dup of this on stackoverflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/952886/editing-large-files-on-mac-os-x <comment3184> (That SO question should probably be moved to Super User or here :) <comment3187> Given that TextWrangler is BBEdit's little brother, I'd guess that someone who is already using BBEdit won't find anything new there. <comment3189> +1 for recommending BBEdit and "Iä! Iä! Pnoies fhtagn!". My favorite so far is "The ponies' saronite shoes have been reinforced with titanium, and have a buff applied which increases both ground and flight speed by 30%." <comment3190> I reviewed a previous version of BBEdit for *Macworld*, and was sorely disappointed that I wasn't allowed to put "No actual ponies" under the Cons section. <comment11085> vim helped me edit a 512MB+ text file. I wish there was something like EM Editor (http://www.emeditor.com/) for Mac. <comment86823> The 64bit version of Emacs should also be pretty good when opening such big files. <comment86824> How big is the file you are trying to load? Textmate is terrible with large files, especially files with long lines. I've never had any problem with BBedit opening 10s of Mbyte files. <comment86841> There is also `view` for a read-only vi session. <comment105289> And [Sublime Text 3](http://sublimetext.com/3) more faster then previous version. <comment105290> Define "large".    Usually it becomes interesting when the files does not fit in available memory. <comment105292> @lhf less works on a window of the file, vi reads in the whole file in memory. <comment160536> I've been working with a 1.37 GB log file generated by parsing a 13 GB binary file, and both versions of Sublime Text have been unimpressive. They took a minute or more to open the file, and trying to type in search strings resulted in temporary spinning-pizzas-of-death while the program was doing unrequested searches on my partially-typed text. 010 Editor, although it has a clunky interface, is quite fast and stable in comparison. <comment244354> Hex Fiend is _way_ faster than VIM on the command line and blows `less` or `more` away. Especially for multi-gigabyte single-line text files. Recommended. <comment263637> Kill Vim with fire. <comment272294> +1 I just tried hex fiend on the strength of this rec and it snarfed up a 3+gb inbox archive like instantly, and then successfully searched through the whole thing for a word in under 20 seconds. <comment321215> Sublime Text is nice for medium size files but if you try to open a 50GB file (having 12GB RAM) it crashes. <comment362612> this could be the notepad++ or even better but needs some tweeks. It just prints whatever there in the file no matter of new line or not. I will see if I can make some changes on my freetime to make it taking consideration of new lines. <comment366951> I easily did a find and replace on a 1.06GB file with MacVim and LargeFile. brilliant!
