block "GET - On the App Store" link ads in Mobile Safari <body> A lot of mobile optimised web sites display App Store links on the top of the page.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/E6Ejq.png" alt="enter image description here"  How to block this annoying ads? I already run and ad blocker for iOS.  <answer294719> I’m afraid the answer is you can’t block them, at least not through a setting in iOS or a Content Blocker extension for Safari. There are patches available for jailbroken devices though.  These ads are shown through the “Smart App Banners” feature of Safari. As far as I know, there is no setting in iOS to turn them off. Because of the way Safari Content Blocker extensions work, I also don’t think they can block the HTML tag that tells Safari to display the ad.  I might just be wrong, but other sources (see: blog post, reddit thread) also indicate these banners can’t be easily disabled.  At least Safari does seem to remember that you don’t want to see an ad for a particular app (or on a particular site, I’m not sure) if you close the banner using the “⨯” button on the left.
