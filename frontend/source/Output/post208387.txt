Copy to clipboard from Tmux in El Capitan <body> I am quite happy with the Terminal changes in El Capitan (see e.g. this question).  However, i can't figure out how to enable copying to system clipboard from within Tmux. For instance, now that I am able to select text within Tmux properly by mouse, how can i copy selected text to clipboard as well, in addition to Tmux's own buffer?  I have the following in my codetmux.conf/code:  precodesetw -g mode-mouse on set -g mouse-select-pane on set -g mouse-resize-pane on set -g mouse-select-window on  setw -g mode-keys vi bind-key -t vi-copy 'v' begin-selection bind-key -t vi-copy 'y' copy-selection /code/pre  I tried modifying the last line to  precodebind-key -t vi-copy 'y' copy-selection \; copy-pipe "pbcopy" /code/pre  but it didn't really work. Would be grateful for suggestions!  Thanks!  <answer208599> i find only one way  open terminal settings/profiles in terminal info change terminal type from xterm-256 to ansi open new terminal window and enjoy :)  <answer210521> Actually, i was wrong when stating that codecopy-pipe/code does not work. It does, and codecopy-selection/code is then superfluous, as codecopy-pipe/code both copies text to Tmux pasteboard and pipes to an arbitrary shell command. So the following line works:  precodebind-key -t vi-copy 'y' copy-pipe "pbcopy" /code/pre  However, one needs to press codey/code before releasing the mouse button. I've stumbled across this in the documentation for tmux-yank plugin:  "When making a selection using tmux mode-mouse on or mode-mouse copy-mode,   you cannot rely on the default 'release mouse after selection to copy' behavior. Instead, press y before releasing mouse."  So it works, but with somewhat annoying need to press codey/code in order to copy mouse-selected text.  <answer213095> Actually, I just find out very simple solution how to enable copying using Cmd+C again.   In default Terminal application go to View-"Allow mouse reporting" and uncheck it. Thats it.  PS: Obviously, the new nice features like dragging split screen in tmux stop working after unchecking the mouse reporting.  <answer235507> If you hold the function key down you can select and copy to clipboard with apple+c as well.  <answer236942> Using tmux version 2.2 or later add the following to your tmux.conf file:  precodebind-key -t emacs-copy MouseDragEnd1Pane copy-pipe "pbcopy" bind-key -t vi-copy MouseDragEnd1Pane copy-pipe "pbcopy" /code/pre  <answer248828> If you use iTerm2 3.x, you can make copy / paste work by enabling codeApplications in terminal may access clipboard/code:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/C6jqD.png" alt="enter image description here"  Just highlight text with your mouse to copy it into the OS X clipboard!  You can also paste from the OS X clipboard into tmux with the usual kbdCmd/kbd + kbdV/kbd.  <answer253007> Using tmux 2.2, OS X El Capitan, Terminal Version 2.6.1 (the default that ships with El Capitan), the following setup works flawless (so far).  precode$ cat ~/.tmux.conf set -g mouse on bind-key -t emacs-copy MouseDragEnd1Pane copy-pipe "pbcopy" bind-key -t vi-copy MouseDragEnd1Pane copy-pipe "pbcopy" /code/pre  To copy, press the left mouse button, mark the text, and let go. The marked text is then in the clipboard and can be pasted with kbdCmd/kbd + kbdv/kbd as usual.  <answer281533> The answer of @Oplatek take effect     In default Terminal application go to View-"Allow mouse reporting" and uncheck it.    But by this way, we would not be able to scroll the screen by mouse.  Here's another way without disable codeAllow mouse reporting/code: Press codeFn/code and select the text by mouse.  <comment251582> Cmd-C doesn't work? <comment251584> @partix - no, as copied text is auto-deselected after releasing the mouse button (or trackpad). Of course it does work in Terminal, but not from Tmux within terminal. <comment255573> Update to Tmux 2.1 broke mouse scrolling in Tmux panes. <comment257291> PS: I used previously solution from @siphiuel, which works also fine. <comment283932> Thank you!!! This is the simplest way! Only that the history is broken.I can only see part of hitstory <comment288066> We are looking for something more than a single line answer.  Try expanding your answer to give further detail. <comment316747> If you are using Terminal.app: in macOS Sierra this won't work due to regression in the Terminal.app behaviour. You will need to use "reattach-to-user-namespace" hack again. <comment316967> Agree on @m1keil comment. Moreover, for some reason i had to compile reattach-to-user-namespace with additional switches, like this: `brew install reattach-to-user-namespace --with-wrap-pbcopy-and-pbpaste` (i am using Homebrew) <comment340591> Super nice. This works <comment344615> this was the easiest solution for me. <comment347012> and this also works for a remote tmux session; I'm thinking that the `bind-key ... copy-pipe` solution might only work if it's a local tmux session.  Then again, maybe if you do the remote tmux session within a local tmux session, it might work?  Anyway, unchecking "Allow mouse reporting" worked for me, and there's even a shortcut âŒ˜-R (Cmd-R) so that you can quickly toggle it off to make a copy, then back on again.
