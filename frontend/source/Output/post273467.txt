Connect to wifi before opening Safari after reboot? <body> I'm running macOS 10.12.3 on a late 2016 13" MacBook Pro. Whenever I reboot my computer and everything reopens, Safari opens automatically and tries to load all my pages, oftentimes before the wifi has a chance to connect, resulting in a bunch of "Failed to open page" errors and making me quit and reopen Safari to get the pages to load properly.  Is there any way to queue the resume actions such that Safari won't open until after I've connected to the wifi network? Thanks!
