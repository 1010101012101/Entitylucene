What tool exists to identify the RGB value of a pixel? <body> I need to get the RGB for a pixel that is in an image. Under Windows this is easy but is there a way to do this on Mac OS X?  <answer25422> I usually use DigitalColor Meter (in Utilities). As long as it's open, it gives you the RGB values of the pixel below your mouse cursor.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UjwKz.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer25423> Use the built-in app code/Applications/Utilities/DigitalColor Meter/code. Place your mouse pointer over the pixel you want the color of, and DigitalColor Meter will show the RGB values.  <answer30830> I use SpotColor (recently renamed to Hues, more info here)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jcaE1.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xfwpA.png" alt="enter image description here"  and HexPicker (which currently has a slight issue with Lion still)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EVEY4.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer30840> ColorSnapper is the best. $4.99 on the Mac App Store.    Just take a look at the demo video and you'll see what I mean.  <answer30849> I have started relying on the Digital Color Picker plug in to extend the Mac OS X color palette. It's made by Wade from Panic.  <comment28766> The only drawback is that the new Lion Digital Color Meter won't give you hex values. The one in Snow Leopard did. <comment35413> @Wheat you can change it to show hex under `View` → `Show values as` → `hexadecimal` <comment64163> @koiyu Yes, but you can't set that as the default AFAIK. Really bugs me! <comment237020> Anyone know what the difference is between "native" values and "generic" RGB? They are different. I noticed that if I use native colors, they look different on the iOS simulator. Generic seems to be closer. <comment362790> This app is no longer available in the Apple store.
