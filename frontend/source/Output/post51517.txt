How to jailbreak iPad2 3G 4.3.5? <body> I just bought a new (refurbished) iPad2 3G, and it came with 4.3.5.  It seems I can't jailbreak it because:  ul liThere's no jailbreak for 4.3.5/li liThere's no untethered jailbreak yet for 5.1.1/li liI can't change the firmware to any other version because the signing windows have closed and I don't have any SHSH blobs saved/li /ul  Am I right? Thanks.  <answer51524> Yeah, I think you may have missed your window. It seems that a 5.1.1 jailbreak is not too far away (if the jailbreak rumour mill is to be believed), so you might just have to wait it out for that.  <comment59025> Yes, you'll just have to wait.
