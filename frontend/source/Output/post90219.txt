Change default installation location to install xCode <body> I want to install Xcode in my MacBook Air OSX 10.8.3. The issue is my MacBook Harddisk is just 64GB and it's almost full. I have an external HDD (Formatted to MAC partition) and how can I install Xcode to this HDD? Because when I am trying to install Xcode I am getting an error there is no sufficient memory available.  Thanks.  <answer91744> An idea:  ol liMove some of your data to your external HDD to free up some disk space temporarily./li liInstall Xcode (to your internal HDD)./li liMove the Xcode application to your external HDD (I believe it is OK to relocate recent versions of Xcode by dragging it in the Finder, since it is now a self-contained application)./li liMove your data back to your internal HDD again./li /ol  <answer95970> I recently moved my Xcode (4.6.2) from /Applications to /Users/daniel/Applications (I'm getting ready to slim down the main system partition to use an iSCSI target for my home folder, and want as much on it as possible).  The link in the comment by Buscar above isn't valid for new Xcodes that come through App Store. Instead, just move the app using Finder. You'll probably be asked to supply your credentials (due to admin permissions on some of the files inside Xcode.app).  You'll notice at first that Xcode starts up as if nothing happened. All seems to be well, but isn't quite, though â€” your Command Line Tools will be fudged. Other stuff that depend on it, like Homebrew, will fail unless you do this:  In Xcode, open Preferences and go to the "Locations" tab. The dropdown labeled "Command Line Tools" will be blank and there'll be a warning sign next to it.  Simply select the Xcode in that dropdown, and after once again supplying your credentials, all is well :) Even updates will perform as expected (I updated to 4.6.3 with no issues).  <comment107782> how big is your email folder? <comment107783> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6772078/how-do-i-specify-an-installation-location-for-xcode-4-1-from-the-mac-app-store
