Latronix KVM stopped working after last java update <body> I see this error when open jnlp file via javaws manually: codejava.lang.AssertionError: Threading violation: not AppKit thread/code  Is there anything I can do with it?  <answer70068> Once I reverted back to the Apple provided java packages, it fixed my problems.  The article for this download is:  ul liJava for OS X 2012-006: How to re-enable the Apple-provided Java SE 6 applet plug-in and Web Start functionality/li /ul  Update: Note that for some people, the Java 7 update works with Lantronix Spiders. I can confirm that a colleague with the same model Macbook Pro has no problems using the latest Java 7 update. Another with a Macbook Air experiences the same issue, which is also resolved by rolling back.  <answer74996> I found that on Lantronix Spider under Console settings, change "KVM Console Deployment" from "Web Start" to "Applet" and it worked again.    <comment81372> Answers on Ask Different need to be more than just a link. It's okay to include a link, but please summarize or excerpt it in the answer. The idea is to make the answer stand alone. <comment81376> I've had the same problem with other KVM vendors...  Seems they're very picky about the *exact* update of Java that you can have. <comment81501> Super, thank you very much! <comment87096> Remember to demand an update of your Latronix software from Latronix. <comment87152> For me it started worked like magic, without any changes
