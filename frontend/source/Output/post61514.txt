Unable to connect to iMac via Apple Remote Desktop 3 <body> I have an office environment with 2 iMac's. We are using an Windows 2008 R2 server in workgroup mode for simple file sharing, DNS requests, and to run an application that requires Windows. I am trying to use Apple Remote Desktop 3.6 (470.93) from iMac1 to connect to second (iMac2).   When I enter an IP address for the second iMac and leave the DNS Name blank it will save the connection but upon trying to connect via the "control" option ARD fails to find the target system. If I enter just the DNS name (as indicated on target iMac under sharing and not the IP address, ARD save the connection with the DNS but without the IP address and it fails. iMac1 is running OS X 10.7.4 and iMac2 is running OS X 10.6.8 and ARD 3.5.3.:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mACf0.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vzgqB.png" alt="enter image description here"  ul liI have verified that both machines have REMOTE Management enabled under sharing in preferences./li liWe have both forward and reverse lookup zones on the server and I have verified that they are working properly./li liI have determined that our hardware firewall is not an issue as well./li liBoth machines are on LAN and I can ping either machine from Windows server/li liBoth iMac's are physically cabled via ethernet/li liBoth machines are on same subnets/li liEthernet switch has been power cycled/li liBoth iMac's have been rebooted/li /ul  iMac1 was as some point in the past able to connect to iMac2 with no issues according to internal users with this configuration. Looking for suggestions for possible place to continue to trouble shoot. I can also provide additional information as requested.  <answer63129> Try using the "kickstart" command on iMac2:   codesudo /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ARDAgent.app/Contents/Resources/kickstart -configure -users USERNAME -access -on -privs -all -clientopts -setmenuextra -menuextra yes -restart -agent -menu -console/code  (Obviously change USERNAME to whatever local account you wish to use to control via ARD).  Remote Desktop is still a really finicky, crashy beast (even on 3.6).  <answer75341> I got the same error message on a small number of machines that I look after, I was able to SSH onto a machine but not control it via ARD - indicating that the sharing preferences were correctly configured but something else was "broken". I tried the "kickstart" above, sadly with no positive result. My Kit included: Late 2011 MBP, 10.8.2 OS with ARD 3.6.1 Admin and a mix of client versions (3.6 and 3.6.1) Their OS versions being a mix of 10.7.x and 10.8.2.     Here is how I managed to fix it in the end:  ul liOn the client machine that you cannot connect to (obviously you will need to physically be in front of the machine - or if you're good with the CLI and can SSH to the box you could do it that way - these instructions stick with the GUI).

I have tried to connect from both 10.6 (ARD v3.5.3) and 10.8 (ARD v3.6.1) Admin machines - Something "screwy" with the 10.7 and above updates :-) <comment308280> Made your formatting much better, use this kind of line separation for step-by-step processes in the future if you can. <comment336739> I don't mean to drag this out of the past, but I've found that simply unchecking and re-checking the "Remote Management" is usually enough to get a device working in ARD 3.8.5.
