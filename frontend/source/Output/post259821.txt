Restore iOS default settings without user interaction <body> I have some iOS devices in a device farm that I'm trying to automate as much as possible. I'd like to be able to clean them after use (i.e. restore them to a set state) without having to physically interact with the devices.  So far, I've found I can do this:  ol liInstall codeidevicebackup2/code from libimobiledevice/li liRun codeidevicebackup2 backup /tmp/iphonebackup/code/li liRun codeidevicebackup2 restore /tmp/iphonebackup --system --reboot/code/li liWait for reboot/li /ol  After the reboot, "Update Complete", then "Welcome to iPhone" screens are present. These interfere with automated operation of the device (e.g. launching apps). I hoped I could launch an XCUITest to navigate through this pointless wizard but I get codeCould not launch “WebDriverAgent”: Unlock the device “iPhone” and repeat the action/code in Xcode when attempting this.  Is it possible to skip this setup wizard after restoring settings? Or is there another way to reset the phone to a state where I can interact with it from the command line successfully?
