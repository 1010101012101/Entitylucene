Trying to pass images to shell command using automator <body> I am creating this service for Finder that will receive image files and pass to a shell command.  The idea is this:  ol liI select image files on finder./li liI right click and choose the service I am creating/li lithe service receives the files and passes to sips, so it will scale the images to a given size./li /ol  this is how I created it.  sips would run on terminal if I type  precodesips -z 750 1334 *.png   (or any other extension, including *.*) /code/pre  I am hoping that $* would pass a list of arguments to sips, but this is not working.  How do I do that?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ga14t.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer155244> You're looking for code$@/code:  precodesips -z 750 1334 "$@" /code/pre  <answer155248> I found a following solution that works for me:  precodefor f in "$@"; do   sips -z 750 1334 "$f" done /code/pre  <comment182619> not working. I have found an answer. See my answer. <comment182620> nice one, glad you found a solution that works for you. For us who do not understand, what does it do ? (why $f) but you got a + anyway :) <comment182623> good question, but it works! thanks anyway +1 to you too! <comment360836> `$f` comes from the `f` in Line 1: `for f ...`; Line 1 pseudocode: `for {each file} in {input list of files}`
