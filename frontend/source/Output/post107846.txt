How to enable HiDPI mode on external display in OS X 10.9 Mavericks? <body> The usual method of using Quartz Debug doesn't seem to work anymore.   <answer107906> Running  precodesudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.windowserver.plist DisplayResolutionEnabled -bool true /code/pre  nd restarting worked for me:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/O7iod.png" alt=""  I only tested it with the internal display of an iMac though.  <answer152669> actually it works on external displays such as TVs, but the list in System Preferences is limited. you can try two things:  ul lieither hold "alt" when clicking "Scaled" button, or/li liinstall one of the menu utilities such as http://www.resolutiontab.com//li /ul  the first one didn't work for me as it kept only showing "tv friendly" resolutions (720p, 1080p and 1080i). the second did indeed show 960x540 HiDPI i was after for my tv.  <answer248888> It seems to me that OSX is preventing TVs (or the other way around) from using HiDPI on non-scaling mode. For example if your TV is 1080p, the 960 X 540 HiDPI won't work, but 1280 X 720 HiDPI mode will (but it will be blurry because it is really running 2560 X 1440 on a 1920 X 1080 display).  <comment127202> Tried this already, doesn't seem to work for external display. <comment141578> Doesn't work for me either.

Used "Display Menu" from app store to switch to mode. <comment210934> Pressing Alt did the trick for me
