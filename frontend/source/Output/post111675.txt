Windows are not showing when using cmd+tab <body> On some occasions, when I use cmd+tab to switch to a window, the window itself doesnt show- though the menu bar of that window does show. If I want to show the window, I have to the doc and click the icon- and then the window will show.  I thought it has to do with the desktop space of that window, but it isnt- I just can't seem to make the window show on cmd+tab, I have to click it from the doc.  Am I missing something? is there a way to show the window when using cmd+tab?  <answer111689> I was going to add post as comment but i don't have the privilege  When does this happen to you? if it happens in Parallels Desktop Coherence mode, try Alt+Tab  <comment131317> AFAIK it's a bug in Mac OS X.
