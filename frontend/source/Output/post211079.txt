Control characters in Terminal and an international keyboard <body> I have a Linux server with services running inside codesystemd/code containers. To access the shell inside a container, I can use the command codemachinectl login &lt;container&gt;/code. That command will give me the container's login prompt and this message:  codeConnected to container &lt;name&gt;. Press ^] three times within 1s to exit session./code  After I'm done and type codeexit/code or codelogout/code, I'm returned to the container's login prompt. In order to get back to the host's shell, I need to send the control character code^]/code (three times within one second).  I'm using an international (Finnish) keyboard and instead of having its own dedicated key, the code]/code character is kbd⌥/kbd+kbd9/kbd. But when I press kbdctrl/kbd+kbd⌥/kbd+kbd9/kbd, it's not recognized as the control character code^]/code and I'm stuck at the login prompt.  How can I send a proper code^]/code control character with an international keyboard?  <answer211080> There might be a more direct solution, but here's the one I found.  If you go tobr kbdTerminal/kbd → kbdPreferences.../kbd → kbdProfiles/kbd → the profile you're using → kbdKeyboard/kbdbr you'll get a list of mappings between function keys and special keystrokes.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/O5cm2.png" alt="Terminal Preferences"  We want to add the code^]/code to this list, so click on kbd+/kbd, and choose the key, and optionally modifier, you would like use. (I went with kbdctrl/kbd+kbdF12/kbd, and since kbdF12/kbd is also the key for volume up, what I actually need to press is kbdfn/kbd+kbdctrl/kbd+kbdF12/kbd.)  In the text field, we need to enter the correct control character, but the thing is, kbdctrl/kbd+kbd⌥/kbd+kbd9/kbd is not recognized here either. The solution is to directly paste in the correct octal code, which happens to be code\035/code (you can copy&amp;paste it from here).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mQ5Oe.png" alt="Keyboard Mapping"  Now pressing kbdfn/kbd+kbdctrl/kbd+kbdF12/kbd sends the proper code^]/code control character, and I can get back to the host's shell.
