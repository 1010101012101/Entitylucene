Pasting a screenshot into Powerpoint results in truncation: even though in MSWord it is perfect <body> The following is an image representing the source of a clipboard cut and paste operation.  Actually the image shows up embetter/em in MsWord: here it is blurry  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KmZWk.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  However it is emmuch/em worse in PowerPoint when pasted either from (a) the clipboard or (b) first to Word, copy into clipboard again and then paste into Powerpoint: in fact it is truncated  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZNMfM.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  So .. what is the deal with pasting to PowerPoint ?  I am using PP for Mac 2011 v 14.1.  <answer208953> It seems there were a  toolbar at the bottom of the screen that strongonly shows up after you click once on the (messed up) screenshot/strong and has an strongemimpressively unhelpful/em/strong default value set.  Below I show having finally randomly clicked on the correct icon:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/btpws.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Now emwhy the picture would not be/em already emsized properly/em .. well we can (un)-thank the PP designers for that.
