CNET on Mac - page not found <body> I've been having this problem for some time now - first I thought it was some temporary thing with CNET servers, but it doesn't seem so.  I can see the index pages of CNET sites (download.cnet.com, news.cnet.com), but when I delve deeper by clicking some application link on download.cnet.com or get direct link to some news from Twitter, I get error 'page not found' as seen on the image:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/voPts.png" alt="enter image description here"  It seems that all links that point to CNET URLs having strong.html/strong in them yield errors constantly. Other pages (e.g emMac software/em etc) are mostly OK (at least for the first click, but repeatedly refreshing gets me few random errors too)  This happens with all my browsers (Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Opera), whereas it strongdoes not/strong happen with IE 8 running on Win 7 inside a VirtualBox on the emsame/em Mac, so it is not related to my network, but with my Mac borwsers somehow or Mac OS X.  BTW, all other websites are totally OK and this is only related to *.cnet.com sites. I have extensions and add-ons in Safari, Chrome and Firefox, but Opera is vanilla as I only use it for testing purposes, so could not be caused by some extension.  Specs:  ul liMac OS X 10.6.7/li liMacBook Pro 6,2/li liSafari 5.0.5/li liChrome 11.0/li liFirefox 4.0.1/li liOpera 11.10/li /ul  <answer16722> Possible solution: strongchanging first preferred language/strong in browser.  It might fix the problem if you choose strongEnglish/strong as you strongfirst preferred language/strong in browser settings. When requesting a page, browsers sends list of preferred languages for content. (For example, based on these settings Google redirects you to your local Google site.)  Changing preferred language:  ul liFirefox 5: emTools-Options-Content-Languages/em./li liChrome: emwrench-icon-Options-Under the Hood-Web Content-Languages and spell-checker settings/em  (instructions)/li /ul  hr  It might be working on your virtual machine if default Windows (in VM) language was set to English. Then browsers would also choose English as your default content language.  hr  When my default language was set to English or German I had no problems navigating emcnet/em sites. After setting my first preferred language to Lithuanian I was getting same errors as you.  It appears that this is internal emcnet/em bug.  Tested on Windows XP Firefox 5, Chrome.  <comment18451> Testing with Crome it worked. Thank you. I don't visit CNET that often, but now at least I know how to access it when I really need some article. Thanks.
