Power Connector for SSD in 2009 Mac Pro <body> I have a Samsung 840 Pro in my 2009 Mac Pro, and due to the 2009 Mac Pro only being SATA 2 I get about half the read/write speeds. I've been doing some research and I came across a SATA 3 PCI-E card that will work in a 2009 Mac pro.  I'm going to put my SSD in my second optical bay drive and run a SATA cable up to it, but what do I do about power?  <answer156878> I guess you figured this out a year ago now -br but you need a PATA - SATA power adapter [couple of quid/bucks/shekels from Maplin's/Radio Shack etc] &amp; run it from one of the old superdrive power-supplies you'll find ready &amp; waiting in that bay.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NlZc2.jpg" alt="enter image description here"
