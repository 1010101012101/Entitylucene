Weird character after pressing Esc in xcode <body> Ever since I installed osx and xcode on my new macbook (about a year ago) I got this weirdest problem I can't get rid of. Anytime I press Esc key in xcode, one character gets printed. I can't copy paste it here (it won't paste anything), but it looks like upside-down question mark. When I paste it to the Pages app, it looks like ordinary exclamation mark, probably because of different encoding or something.  This is very annoying, how can I get rid of it? I sure hope it is not a desirable feature. Reinstalling xcode or upgrading from 4.2 to 4.3 didn't help, upgrading osx from 1.6 to 1.7 didn't help either. I would prefer to avoid reinstalling of osx if possible  <answer44226> A quick google shows this  Take a look at your key binding setting and make sure that ESC is not binded   <comment50263> Can you paste it into the search of the Character Palette and tell us what comes up? <comment50271> Thanks for pointing that out. I feel like stupid again, because I was googling this many times before and couldn't find any info while you could do that in matter of seconds :/ Weird think is that ESC was not binded but it looks like it should have been. I bound it to "Cancelation" and everything works now. Thanks a lot! <comment50272> I can't paste it there either, looks like it is one hell of a mystery character :) <comment50273> Very weird. What shows up when you display the clipboard in Finder? <comment50274> (I see the problem's been solved, but I still wonder what the character is! :D) <comment50275> It is empty, as if nothing was copied. I never knew I would learn so many new (basic) things about osx through this question (show clipboard and character palette), thanks for that :) <comment50277> same thing for "cut", character dissapears from xcode file, but clipboard is still empty. I can paste it back into the xcode or Pages, but nowhere else. Looks like it is character that only some app recognize
