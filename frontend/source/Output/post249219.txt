"Other storage" taking up most of hard drive <body> I am having an issue on my wife's MacBook Pro running OS X 10.10.5 (late 2012 13-inch retina). The hard drive is only 120 GB, but the "other" category in the About this Mac storage option is taking up over 81 GB. I've tried following a number of turorials online including cleaning up mail cache, downloads, browser cache, etc. to little avail.  My question is, is this expected? I feel like 81 GB for other storage is a bit excessive, but I can't find any files large enough to indicate this should be an issue (including browsing almost her entire user directory and looking at folder sizes).  Anything you could offer would help.  <answer249227> Other storage could refer to anything that OS X doesn't recognize as one of the storage categories (music, videos...) In order to find the source of the files, I would recommend checking the size of folders to determine where large files are. In order to see the size of a folder, right click it and click "get info". You should be able to use this to locate the source of the problem.
