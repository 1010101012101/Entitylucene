Which mail daemon does OS X 10.8.4 run by default? <body> I'm debugging some mail related stuff on my Mac, and not quite sure how my system is even sending mail.  I can run a simple command like codedate | mail -s test myemail@mydomain.com/code and receive an email just fine. Cool. I can also use PHP's codemail()/code function to send mail. PHP's codesendmail_path/code configuration variable is code/usr/sbin/sendmail -t -i/code, looks okay.  But the weird thing is I don't think Postfix is even running...  precode$ postqueue -p postqueue: fatal: Queue report unavailable - mail system is down $ ps -aef | grep -i postfix   501 28403 25525   0  2:10PM ttys042    0:00.00 grep -i postfix $ launchctl list | grep -i mail -   0   com.apple.MailMigratorService 70829   -   0x7fa87941a060.anonymous.Mail $ launchctl list | grep -i postfix -   0   org.postfix.master /code/pre  How is my Mac even sending mail from the codemail/code terminal command if Postfix isn't running? Is there some other mail daemon OS X runs?  <answer235669> It is using postfix. At a high-level, when you execute the codemail/code command, the following is happening:  ul liInvoking codemail/code drops your message as a file in the postfix maildrop directory, i.e.,  code/var/spool/postfix/maildrop/code. This happens because codemail/code calls codesendmail/code which calls codepostdrop/code which puts the file in the maildrop./li liThe postfix main daemon, codemaster/code is configured to startup when the maildrop has files in it. This is specified in the code/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.postfix.master.plist/code file./li liThe codemaster/code daemon starts other needed postfix processes such as codepickup/code, codeqmgr/code and codesmtp/code to deliver the mail./li liAll these process including the master daemon die after being idle for period of time./li /ul  The codepostqueue -p/code command needs the showq daemon which will be started  only when master is running. When that's not the case, you see that error. The codeshowq/code daemon can be configured to always be running so that you can use the codepostqueue -p/code command. If you want to just see the mail queue, you can do this:  precode$ sudo postfix start &amp;&amp; postqueue -p &amp;&amp; sudo postfix stop /code/pre  But note that if you start it this way, you must shut it down too. Otherwise the postfix master daemon will be resident and won't be on-demand anymore.  If you want to know which processes start after you issue codemail/code, you can use the codeexecsnoop/code command to see which process are starting up:  precode$ sudo execsnoop -v STRTIME                UID    PID   PPID ARGS 2016 Apr 20 23:57:52   501   2358   1154 mail 2016 Apr 20 23:57:52   501   2359   2357 date 2016 Apr 20 23:57:52   501   2360      1 sendmail 2016 Apr 20 23:57:52   501   2367   2360 postdrop 2016 Apr 20 23:57:52     0   2369   2343 cleanup 2016 Apr 20 23:58:23     0   2384      1 master 2016 Apr 20 23:58:23     0   2385   2384 pickup 2016 Apr 20 23:58:23     0   2386   2384 qmgr 2016 Apr 20 23:58:24     0   2387   2384 bounce 2016 Apr 20 23:58:24     0   2388   2384 trivial-rewrite 2016 Apr 20 23:58:24     0   2389   2384 local 2016 Apr 20 23:58:24     0   2390   2384 smtp /code/pre  <comment114793> I don't know the details, but Postfix spawns when you use the `mail` command, and shuts down shortly afterward.  Try `mail`ing something and note you can reach Postfix on port 25 for a bit afterward, but not later. <comment114799> Postfix is the default! It comes pre installed with osx. <comment114800> Try disabling it  with sudo /bin/launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.postfix.master.plist
