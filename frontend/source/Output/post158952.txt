Fullscreen a running application from the terminal <body> I'm trying to pull a prank on a friend. I have a shell script that continuously cats a C source code file so make it look like the terminal is "hacking" something. The next thing I would like to do is have the script make the terminal full screen.  Is there anyway in the default terminal app to make a window full screen based off of a PID or some other identifier?  <answer158954> Use applescript to send the kbd⌘/kbdkbd⌃/kbdkbdF/kbd shortcut:  precodetell application "Terminal"     activate     tell application "System Events" to keystroke "F" using {command down, control down} end tell /code/pre  You can use the codeosascript/code command to execute applescripts.  <comment186856> Thanks, I completely forgot about sending fake key strokes. Now off to do something funny. Mwahahah
