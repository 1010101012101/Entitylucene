Changing volume at command line using script/function <body> I found this nifty command which sets volume to 50% (or any level desired):  precodeosascript -e 'set volume output volume 50' /code/pre  I'd love to have a script or function that lets me type codev 50/code or codev 30/code, etc. to easily change the volume levels.  I tried making this bash function:   precodev() { # adjust volume function osascript -e 'set volume output volume $1' } /code/pre  However this gives:   precode25:26: syntax error: Expected expression but found unknown token. (-2741) /code/pre  How can I make this work?  <answer175180> Single quotes ('') suppress parameter expansion so you have to use double quotes:  precodev() {     osascript -e "set volume output $1" } /code/pre  <comment206445> Excellent - that works, thank you. More generally - when should one use double versus single quotes? <comment206446> Single quotes protect everything within, so use double quotes whenever you need to expand variables etc. <comment206484> As a side note: to mute the volume, use `osascript -e 'set volume output muted true'`
