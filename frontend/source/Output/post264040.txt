Delete pictures from a particular date on photo stream on device only <body> I would like to delete pictures from the photo stream on my old device from Thanksgiving to current. I realize this happened when I enabled wi fi, however I'd like to remove those photos from the stream without removing all of the older from the stream. How do I do this?  I realize if I disable this device in the library it will delete them all but I would like to keep all of them from 2014, 2015, and 2016 till Thanksgiving. I do not want to remove these from all devices just this one.
