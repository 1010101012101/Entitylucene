Edit .PSD File on the iPhone <body> I have a .PSD file which needs to edited. It contains just two layers, one an image and the other a text layer. I want to edit the text layer. I read online Photoshop touch doesn't let you edit .psd files.  Is there any way to do this on the iPhone?  <answer132033> You might want to try iDraw for iOS ($8.99 on iTunes).  It's the only app for iOS that I ever came across that claims to be able to import (and export) PSD files. I haven't (yet) tried iDraw myself, so I can't say how well it works, but it looks promising.
