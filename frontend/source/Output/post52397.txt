When do iTunes Connect Stats update? <body> I've read in quite a few places that sales trend reports update anywhere between 3AM - 5AM Cupertino time once a day.  strongBut what about other stats?/strong  ol liWhen do app ratings update?/li liWhen do customer reviews update?/li /ol  <answer80408> Both of those usually update almost instantly. Sometimes it may take a few minutes, but I've experienced instant results from people posting ratings and reviews. Thanks!  <comment59950> btw, it's not official but there is a twitter account, @itcstatus, you can follow which tweets within 15 minutes of the trend reports being updated. <comment59952> @Jonathan. Hmm, okay, I'll check that out too. But I am more interested in when the ratings and reviews update. I would imagine they update more frequently, but I can't find that info anywhere. <comment59954> Sorry i don't know the other parts, which is why i posted a comment not answer, sorry if I got your hopes up :) <comment59955> No, actually, that twitter account had a service, which I like, so although it doesn't answer my question, it's a good comment, thank you.
