What now? 24 inch iMac and 10.7.5 <body> I have a 24 inch iMac late 2006 build.  Lion 10.7.5 (11G63) 2.33GHz Intel Core Duo 2GB 667 MHz DDR2 SDRAM  I use it for my photography and graphic art.  It works perfectly and the screen is calibrated regularly.  Trouble free.  Safari no longer supports it, and my bank, Facebook, etc etc ignore me on this browser now. I cannot update Safari.  Firefox will not support it, now, and in fact will not let me download. (Today)  Chrome (which I tried to download today) says it will no longer support it.  I could not download Chrome.  I have plenty of drive space (most of my stuff is on external HDs and a cloud back up).  This is a very good piece of equipment, and I've never felt the need to update by purchase just to put this one in the trash bin.  What options do I have? Is there a reliable and safe browser still out there that other websites recognize?  Can a new processor be installed (at reasonable cost) to enable latest Safari upgrades?    It seems like a gross waste of good stuff (and environmentally crappy) to send this excellent 24 inch display and computer to the landfill, and to feed money into a new iMac (which could also be made obsolete at the whim of the browser makers)  I know I can use it simply as a work tool, but so much of my work actually can happen remotely via a browser directly from this machine as I work.  I do understand the security implications, although I have active, current, security always running in the background.  What to do?  Tell me something good.    Thanks for reading.
