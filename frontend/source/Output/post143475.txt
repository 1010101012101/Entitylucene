iTunes link not working <body> So there's that app I found from my PC and should like to download: http://www.itunes.apple.com/jp/app/id666206963  When I click the link, my device asks me if I want to open it in the app store, which I confirm. The store opens but where the app is supposed to be displayed, a white rectangle is shown that stays a white rectangle, no matter how long I wait.  How do I resolve this?  <answer143477> That link you have is not correct.  Use this link for your app  https://itunes.apple.com/jp/app/net-ma-que-mjmobairu/id666206963?mt=8  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xcE4k.jpg" alt="web site"  or from the source: http://sega-mj.com/  <comment168981> Right, "httpS" and no "www", thank you. However, that does not solve the issue, I'm still getting a white rectangle, even with your link. <comment168984> see my update, and your iTunes store should ask you to switch to japan, since that app is not available in the USA.
