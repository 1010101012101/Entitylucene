What is the difference between macOS Sierra 10.12.2 Update and macOS Sierra 10.12.2 Combo Update? <body> According to this table, both pump up the version to 10.12.2, both have exactly the same changelog:  ul limacOS Sierra 10.12.2 Update/li limacOS Sierra 10.12.2 Combo Update/li /ul  The only difference I was able to see was the file size (1.94 GB vs. 2.05 GB).  AppStore seems to mention only the "standard" update, not "combo".  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3awRL.png" alt="enter image description here"  Can somebody explain what are the differences? Thank you.  <answer267590> I believe that the "normal" update only has the changes from 10.12.1 to 10.12.2; therefore, you need to have 10.12.1 already installed.  The combo one, OTOH, has all the changes from the last major release (10.12.0).  <comment335795> @calum_b and this is the reason to down vote? <comment335801> I didn't downvote. It was already at -1 when I flagged it as a possible dup.
