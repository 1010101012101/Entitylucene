python2.7 cannot be opened because of a problem <body> Running into an odd issue when my system starts up: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dPw0h.png" alt="python failure"  I have not been able to track the point of failure down yet. I assume that it is some application that is attempting to start at system startup, but I have not yet been able to isolate the application or daemon.  The actual problem report seems to be quite unhelpful in this case:  precodeProcess:               python2.7 [6982] Path:                  /Users/USER/*/python2.7 Identifier:            python2.7 Version:               ???

Any thoughts?  <comment248748> What does /usr/bin/python do? <comment248780> @Mark `/usr/bin/python --version`: `Python 2.7.10` <comment248843> What's the output of `which python`? <comment248844> @Kellen `/usr/local/bin/python` and `/usr/bin/python` <comment248898> I don't use OSX, but on other Unixes I'd use `starce/truss` to see what's going on. I believe the equivalent on OSX is `dtruss` - so from the OSX shell run `dtruss python` and you may get a hint as to your problem.
