This is the card model: codeG.Skill 1x4GB DDR3 1600Mhz SODIMM/code  <answer161828> I would use something like Crucial's online configurator rather than the vague specs in a shop window.  That way you have a guarantee it will work.  Kingston &amp; Corsair have the same kind of thing, but Crucial gives you the option of downloading an app to do all the work for you.
