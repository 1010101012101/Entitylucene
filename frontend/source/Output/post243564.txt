Set language-related environment vars for _all_ processes (not just inside Terminal) <body> On my somewhat creaky MBP running Yosemite, I find that the POSIX environment variables for controlling the locale (codeLANG/code and codeLC_*/code) are properly set inside Terminal windows...  precode$ printenv | grep -E '^(LANG|LC_)' LANG=en_US.UTF-8 $ locale LANG="en_US.UTF-8" LC_COLLATE="en_US.UTF-8" LC_CTYPE="en_US.UTF-8" LC_MESSAGES="en_US.UTF-8" LC_MONETARY="en_US.UTF-8" LC_NUMERIC="en_US.UTF-8" LC_TIME="en_US.UTF-8" LC_ALL= /code/pre  ... but they are emnot/em properly set in the environment provided to GUI applications; for instance, inside an Emacs shell window, the above commands print  precode$ printenv | grep -E '^(LANG|LC_)'  $ locale LANG= LC_COLLATE="C" LC_CTYPE="C" LC_MESSAGES="C" LC_MONETARY="C" LC_NUMERIC="C" LC_TIME="C" LC_ALL= /code/pre  How do I ensure that emevery process running on the computer, regardless of how it was started/em sees the proper LANG= environment setting?  Bonus points for an answer that doesn't need manual action to stay in sync with the language settings in System Preferences.  (Related questions: Where does $LANG variable gets set in Mac OS X? indicates that it is Terminal.app that reflects the language settings from System Preferences to the shell's environment.  Where are system environment variables set in Mountain Lion? suggests that the proper way to make manual global environment settings keeps getting changed with each new version of the operating system, yuck.)  <comment299977> What happens when you start Emacs from the shell? - `open -a Emacs` <comment299979> @fd0 That's interesting, the settings are correct if I do it that way. But I want them to be correct if opened from the Dock or whereever.  Also, Emacs is just an example; this potentially affects several other GUI applications I have. <comment299984> Then you will need to hack the OS with one of the solutions that fits your current operating systems. If you are willing to change your workflow, the solution I proposed has worked for at least seven versions of the OS.
