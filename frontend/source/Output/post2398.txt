Decompressing .sit file <body> I have recently downloaded a code.sit/code archive file.  Is there a way to decompress it at the command line?  <answer2402> I’m sure that Stuffit Deluxe has two command line utilities called emstuff/em and emunstuff/em (they're in code/usr/local/bin/code) as far as I can remember. But you need the Deluxe payware version.   If paying is not your idea, you could technically do the same using the free Stuffit Expander. You have to invoke it from the Terminal with something like:  precodeosascript -e 'tell application "StuffIt Expander" to expand posix file “/path/to/full/file/compressedfile.sit”’ /code/pre  It might not be the best, but it should work.  <answer2418> h2The Unarchiver/h2  Includes a commandline tool. Can unpack some SIT files. I think I have experienced problems with a few SIT files though.  <comment2103> The Unarchiver provides the tool `unar`, that you have to download separately and install yourself. <comment2106> Yep - appears to work well on sit files, and has been recently updated (July 2010). <comment8113> +1, good answer. You should also be able to do `open -a /Applications/Stuffit\ Expander.app /path/to/the/file.sit` <comment35186> The last time I tried the official StuffIt it was spectacular bloatware. I'd avoid it if at all possible.
