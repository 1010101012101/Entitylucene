Some of "Services" menu is in Portuguese <body> I tend to assign keyboard shortcuts to the services I use most often. Occasionally, I need to access one from the toolbar menu. When I dropped the menu down today, I noticed that some of the items were in Spanish. All of the aforementioned items seemed to be the core services - ones I had installed or built myself are still in English.br No idea how this happened. Please see the screenshot below.br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/izfPX.png" alt="Some Spanish, some English."  Running 10.6.8 on a late 08 MBP.  Cheers  <answer54363> Although it seems unclear why did that happen (perhaps you've got some permission issues?), you could delete the Portuguese language package from your System with Monolingual, and that should do the trick.  <answer54366> A common fix for this problem is to go to system preferences/language &amp; text/language and use the Edit button to uncheck the box for the offending language and restart.  <comment62194> FWIW, it looks like the menu items are in Portuguese, not Spanish. Not that that solves your problem or anything. <comment62195> Good call. I noticed right after I posted that some of the words weren't quite right - not that I'm any good in Spanish or Portuguese :) Post title updated, thanks!
