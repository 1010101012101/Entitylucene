How to modify the display sleep and sleep together again? <body> I'm using pmset to set battery-power sleep time independently of display sleep time on my 2014 15" MacBook retina. Before I did that, these values were in lock step when you changed the "turn off display after" setting in the Energy Saver control panel. If I change the control panel setting now, it only affects display sleep.  I'm curious what setting I can use to make the control panel setting affect both display sleep and sleep again?  <comment218662> You could do `pmset resetdefaults` see if that helps. <comment218822> Well I notice that my coworkers who have not messed with their settings have sleep set to 1 in battery mode. Is "1" an undocumented special value which actually means "use the same value as displaysleep"? <comment219305> No, 1 just means sleep in 1 minute as it says in the man page *"sleep - system sleep timer (value in minutes, or 0 to disable)"*. I assume that what you mean is that you can set the value of Display Sleep higher to that of Computer Sleep? Because for me it's in lock only when I try to increase Disp sleep to more than Comp sleep. Here are my [setting](http://hastebin.com/agujayajav.pas) Can you post yours by doing `pmset -g custom` <comment219545> OK I think that explains the default setting then. If sleep=1 and displaysleep1, then the effect is to put sleep in lock-step with displaysleep. I believe that is the default setting, so that jives with the UI which only offers the ability to set displaysleep under battery power. <comment219656> I actually have ability to set display sleep time from Energy Save Pref Pane, for both AC and Battery power. Glad was able to help. :)
