Setting caps lock key to CTRL but still function as caps lock if I press for long enough <body> I just started out using codetmux/code, so I figured I would set my kbdCaps lock/kbd key equal to the kbdCtrl/kbd key.  Though sometimes I do need the kbdCaps lock/kbd key. I don't care if it requires playing with the Terminal or system files, I'm not afraid of that. However it would be nice if I could just run Terminal commands so that I can put it in a script. Also, if possible, it would be nice if it doesn't require extra software, although if it's necessary then there's no problem.  How can I make it so that it's normally a kbdCtrl/kbd key, but if I press it for say 5 seconds it triggers a normal kbdCaps lock/kbd. I was wondering, how can I do this?  <answer76313> Using KeyRemap4MacBook, you could add this to private.xml:  code&lt;autogen&gt;--HoldingKeyToKey-- KeyCode::CONTROL_L, KeyCode::CONTROL_L, KeyCode::VK_NONE, KeyCode::CAPSLOCK, Option::NOREPEAT&lt;/autogen&gt;/code  The threshold for holding a key is 0.2 s by default, but it can be changed in the second tab.  This would change fn+caps lock (control) to caps lock:  code&lt;autogen&gt;--KeyToKey-- KeyCode::CONTROL_L, ModifierFlag::FN, KeyCode::CAPSLOCK&lt;/autogen&gt;/code  <comment88531> That would work. However this old Mac keyboard doesn't have an fn key (it's kind of old). How could I change that to option+capslock? <comment88533> Also, I suppose this requires KR3MB? Yes? If so, is there a way not to use KR4MB? <comment88601> Just change `ModifierFlag::FN` to `ModifierFlag::OPTION`. I don't know any other way to do it. <comment88607> I see, thank you! That works out.
