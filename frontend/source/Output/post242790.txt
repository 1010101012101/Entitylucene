How to uninstall Java SE 6 on OS X 10.11? <body> I found an old copy of Adobe CS4 that I had tucked away. I decided to install on my 2014 MBP as I was interested in running Illustrator for some vector images I was wanting to use. It required that I install legacy Java SE 6 runtime. I did so, but looks like I'm still having issues so I decided to get rid of it. I've uninstalled Adobe, but I'm not sure how to get rid of the deprecated java version as I have no other use for it.  There do seem to be guides on uninstalling Java, but I don't want to do this as I still need the current version for other applications.  <answer242800> If you want to remove Java 6...
