iTerm2: How to change the color used to highlight search results? <body> It seems that iTerm2 is hardcoded to highlight search results using a yellow background color. I tried both the latest release and the nightlies but could not find a way to change that color.  Did I miss something? It seems implausible to me, that a terminal emulator with such a degree of customizability would really hardcode a single color while at the same time making virtually everything else user-configurable.  For clarification, here's a screenshot: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LYrRi.png" alt="enter image description here" As you can see, I searched the screen contents for the word "stack" and all its occurrences are highlighted in yellow (except for the selected one).  <answer162356> Unfortunately, the yellow color is actually hardcoded in the source code and cannot be configured in the preferences.  Here is the corresponding code snippet where the color is applied:  precode if (isMatch &amp;&amp; !bgselected) {      aColor = [NSColor colorWithCalibratedRed:1 green:1 blue:0 alpha:1];  } else ... /code/pre  Source: https://github.com/gnachman/iTerm2/blob/3a99bb0a0e5924e2d515ec9638a4ffa6731a5682/sources/PTYTextView.m#L6274  <answer206531> I was able to change this using the "Selection" color setting under Profiles:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1fX4V.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment189761> Don't know exactly what you meant, could you please add a screenshot? <comment189770> Sure. I've just edited my post. <comment339901> That's only for the current match (i.e. as you cycle through all matches). I believe @raimue is correct below in that the yellow color which applies to all matches is not currently configurable.
