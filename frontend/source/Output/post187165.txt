Deleting a file from Single User mode <body> My macbook's hard disk has 10 MB free space and the login is not possible.  I booted to Single User mode to delete some files but the paths were totally different than the paths I get when I just click on Terminal app from /Applications/Utilities. For instance I've got 'var' and 'root'.  All I need to do is to access the Applications folder through the command line and then to delete some apps.  Can you tell me how can I access the Applications folder?  <answer187166> precodecd /Applications /code/pre  This opens the /Applications folder at root. There's no need to use relative paths.  <answer187167> precodecd /Applications ls -latrsq (shows all files, including their sizes) rm -rf Application.app /code/pre  If the application name contains spaces, use a \ in each space.  Example, Microsoft Word 2011.app would be Microsoft\ Word\ 2011.app  <comment221174> thanks very much but when i try cd /Applications, i can only see safari.app and utilities. i also get a message saying it is "read only" <comment221175> thanks but it didnt worked. can you please read my comment to grgarside and answer again? <comment221176> Thanks, but was a downvote truly necessary? <comment221177> It sounds like you're on the OS X installer volume.   cd /Volumes  cd *volume name of your hard disk*  cd Applications  ls -latrsq (shows all files, including their sizes)  rm -rf Application.app <comment221179> now we are on to something :) a + from me <comment221180> [general note] votes are anonymous. We'll never know whose it was (not mine, btw) <comment221181> thank you. i do cd/Volumes then: ls what i get is: .Trashes and OS X Base System.. what shall i do then? <comment221183> It sounds like it doesn't see your boot volume.  Have you tried booting into recovery mode?  Does it show up in Disk Utility? <comment221185> i've booted from recovery mode :)  of course i havent gave a negative vote to anyone! <comment221186> If you are booted into the recovery/setup environment, do you see the option Disk Utility under the Utilities menu?  If your boot drive doesn't show up under /Volumes in Terminal, I'm curious if it shows up in Disk Util <comment221187> yes i can see the HDD listed on disk utility and i also see the disk 1 (OS X Base System) <comment221188> OS X Base System is the install media <comment221189> Why don't you try performing a fresh installation of OS X and selectively restore some of your content from your latest Time Machine backup? <comment221190> i dont have a time machine. i think the best to do now is to take off the hdd, mount it to another mac as an external drive and remove some files.  if you have a better idea, please let me know, if now, it is ok, you helped a lot and i am thankful!  unfortunately i cant vote your answers cause i have a very low reputation. (it says i need at least 14.) <comment221191> Spend the friggin money on a hard drive, and start backing up your stuff!!!!  There are no excuses for losing a file, none.
