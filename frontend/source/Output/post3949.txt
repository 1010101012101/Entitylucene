How do I find out the system temporary directory? <body> I'm testing an app that uses the System temp Directory. Inside of the app, there is some call to a Cocoa function to query this. Is there a way for me to query for this directory name outside of having to write a Cocoa app of my own? Possibly a command that I can issue in Terminal?  <answer3956> OS X has Python pre-installed, though not necessarily a fresh Python; but this is not cutting-edge stuff.  So:  Open a terminal  precodecat &gt; hack.py import tempfile print tempfile.gettempdir() ^D python hack.py /code/pre  Credit to nosklo  <answer3974> precodeenv /code/pre  Just type this command into Terminal.  With zero arguments it'll print the names and values of variables in the environment.  Alternative with a bit more typing:  precodeecho $TMPDIR /code/pre  <comment3800> Thanks. What a weird path - /var/folders/iz/izqn2b5MF-iz9oL0CURH1U+++TI/-Tmp-/ <comment256141> I found this answer great plus it works on Linux platforms too (probably not a huge concern for you, I realise): http://unix.stackexchange.com/a/84980/68885 <comment285536> This is not a good answer, since this env variable points to different directory every time a different process is invoked. It is made to let each process freely write into a "temp" directory, without worrying that it might overwrite (or read by mistake) something another application wrote.
