Drag and drop items as attachment in Entourage <body> I find it little tedious to drop items in new email and make it an attachment. I need to resize both, source and destination window, so that I can pick and drop the item. This takes time. Yes few seconds more, but it matters.  Is it possible to drag an item from source window and then press command+~ (or command+tab) to chose a destination window and then drop it there? Any other easier solution available?  <answer9582> For most Macintosh applications that accept drag and drop, you can drag and drop files to their Dock icon. So your "flow" might be:  ol liOpen the finder window with the file you want to send/li liDrag it to your dock/li liDrop it on the Entourage icon/li liEntourage will launch and should give you a new message, with that file attached/li /ol  Hope this helps.  <answer9594> You can also begin your drag in the Finder (or your source), trigger Exposé, then drag the file onto the (shrunken) destination window. The window will flash a few times, and then Exposé will close with the destination window frontmost so you can drop your file.  <comment10042> The method you suggest should work fine -- start dragging, switch applications using keyboard, stop dragging.  For Mail.app, there's a built-in service called "New email with attachment", that you can access by right-clicking any file in the Finder. If Entourage supports Automator workflows, you could probably write a similar Service for Entourage using Automator. <comment10126> Although this answer is useful, it does not meet the need completely. This solution will not work when trying to attach while forwarding/replying to an email. Thanks.
