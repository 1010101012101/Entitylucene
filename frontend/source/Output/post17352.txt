live screencasting solution that supports Power PC Macs <body> I have a Power PC and I have been wanting to do a live screencast of a this thing I do, but there doesn't seem to be a single widget out there that would help me out.  It is not just a matter of grabbing the screen, I have Snapz Pro X and it will work, but I want to share it with a bunch of people in real-time. There is no love for the Power PC architecture.  Any ideas?  :(  <answer17353> How about Copernicus?  http://danicsoft.com/software/copernicus/  Or this (More promising, as it is live):   http://b-l-a-c-k-o-p.com/GrabberRaster.html  <answer100471> What about VNC? There is a good server for mac that I used to use named Vine Server. Or you could just use the built in one:  ol liOpen System Preferences/li liGo to Sharing/li liTick the "Screen Sharing" box/li liOpen "Computer Preferences" and make sure the "Allow VNC users to control the screen with a password" box is unticked/li /ol  And then, on the viewing machine:  ol liOpen Safari/li liGo to "vnc://emhostname/em/" where emhostname/em is the ip address/hostname of the server machine/li /ol  <comment18913> Hey, that GrabberRaster seems like a good start! Any ideas about general video conferencing dealios that support PPC? I was having a hard time finding that as well, but I wasn't exclusively looking for it (what with looking for screencasting primarily). Hmmm... :/ <comment18954> You should probably create another question for that. <comment18955> Also, if my answer answered your question, I would appreciate it if you accepted it.
