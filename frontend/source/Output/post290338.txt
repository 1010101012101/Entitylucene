Is it possible, and in case for which iPhone models/iOS versions, to reliably iCloud unlock a locked iOS device? <body> I am not asking for stronghow/strong to do it. It's just that where I live (Zambia), there are often offers on iCloud unlocking floating around on buy&amp;sell FB groups. I am however under the impression that it currently is strongimpossible/strong to iCloud unlock a locked device, as long as it is reasonably modern and has a reasonably up-to-date version of iOS. It is however difficult to find specific and reliable answers to this online, either that or I am asking the wrong way. Is a prerequisite for iCloud unlocking to be able to jailbreak a device? And if so, what is the status of the jailbreak scene?  <comment367221> It's impossible. The only entity who can bypass iCloud activation is Apple. <comment367238> One question per question, please. If you want to focus on one - an edit to the main post will queue this up for review of the close / hold.
