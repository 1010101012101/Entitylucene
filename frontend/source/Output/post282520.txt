Mounting a Network share on login (There was a problem connecting to this server) <body> I have a new piece of software that I've installed that relies on a mounted network share in order to operate. The network share is a hosted MacMini Server, connecting over SMB.  I've added the share to the user's login items, but whenever the computer boots and is logged in, I see the (There was a problem connecting to the server "MacMini") and it doesn't mount.  However, if I simply acknowledge that message, then do Command+K and mount it manually, it will mount without issue.  I've already saved the credentials to KeyChain, I'm just not sure why it wont mount at login.  If anyone has any ideas. Much appreciated.  <comment355939> Take a look a this answer:  https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/268691/how-to-start-a-mysql-server-on-login/268692#268692  It's exactly the same premise, except instead of running the mysql server, you run the mount command.
