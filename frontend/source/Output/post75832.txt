Need application that use FIPS 140-2 encryption libraries <body> I want send email in secure way. Do you have any recommendation?  <answer75843> Lockbin is a web application for sending private email messages and files. It's free! People use it to send things like credit card numbers or confidential information.  Lockbin (lockbin.com) uses FIPS 140-2 encryption libraries, and takes extraordinary precautions to protect and destroy EPHI.  <comment88012> FIPS 140 is a government standard, not a specific implementation. Do you "just" need to be able to send/receive encrypted mail? <comment88024> Yes. I need to send my email secure way. <comment88025> How does it work?
