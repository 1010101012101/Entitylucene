Is there a limit for the attachment size in Messages? <body> I'm trying to send a strong36 MB/strong code.mp4/code video via Messages, but I'm not exactly sure if it's working.  After sending the file, the CPU usage of the processes codeVTDecoderXPCService/code and codeIMTranscoderAgent/code goes up very high (~300%) and then strongonly about 11 MB of data are send/strong.  I doubt that Messages is performing some magical compression that results in &lt;30% of the original video file size for the transfer, instead I assume that the whole file is not send. But I'm not receiving a warning such as:br em"Could not transfer file. Attachment too large..."/em  Is there a limit for the attachment size in Messages?  <answer70646> It seems Apple has not documented this properly. Some articles show that 220MB is over the limit and that it's most likely between 101.4MB and 194MB  In either case, your 36MB file should not be hitting any limits. That means there must be something else going on.  <answer70654> Despite Joost's links, Apple did emofficially/em provide a size limit for Messages attachments.  Extracted from Mountain Lion's Features page:     strongSend large attachments:/strong Send high-quality photos, full HD video, or documents. iMessage allows attachments of up to strong100MB/strong.   Your strong36MB/strong file is, indeed, off the limit.   <comment82027> Thanks for posting information linked to empirical testing. I'll trust TheVerge, but that second source is very vague. ("...limits are reported to be somewhere...") <comment82028> Great, an official source! I'm just surprised that Apple hasn't released a support document yet (http://support.apple.com/). These /osx/whats-new links on apple's homepage change with every release. <comment82030> Nice find! I agree with gentmatt though - they should add these things to support.apple instead
