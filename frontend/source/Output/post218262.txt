Error when running security in Terminal <body> I'm trying to export the keychains in Terminal. This is the code I used   precodesecurity&gt; export -k SystemCACertificates.keychain -t all -f openssl -o goodone.txt /code/pre  And this is the error I got codesecurity: illegal option -- k/code. Can anyone fix it? :)  <answer218273> You probably copied/pasted the example listed in the man page, which actually is supposed to show how codesecurity/code can be run interactively. To fix, you can do one of the following:  ul liRun in interactive mode by executing codesecurity -i/code in Terminal and then just entering codeexport -k SystemCACertificates.keychain -t all -f openssl -o goodone.txt/code when you get the codesecurity&gt;/code prompt/li liRun codesecurity export -k SystemCACertificates.keychain -t all -f openssl -o goodone.txt/code from the shell/li /ul  <comment263864> Now that error went away but a new one came :( This is the new error. **security: SecKeychainItemExport: One or more parameters passed to a function were not valid. export: returned 1** <comment263865> Try without some of the parameters to find the one leading to the problem then :-) <comment263871> OK. Now I tried `security export -k SystemCACertificates.keychain` And got this error  `security: SecKeychainItemExport: One or more parameters passed to a function were not valid. export: returned 1` <comment263884> This just leaves the name of the keychain. It might be easier to export directly from Keychain Utility.
