MacBook Air or MacBook Pro(late 2012) for iOS and web development? <body> I am looking to jump into iOS development and I am planning to purchase my very first Mac. The MacBook Pro Retina 13" is not affordable at the moment but, after going through eBay and some other local stores, I am confused about the differences between the MacBook Pro pre-Retina version and the base MacBook Air 13" model.  The laptop I am going to buy will be my primary machine for the next 2â€“3 years. I plan to run mostly Adobe programs like Photoshop and After effects along with mid to heavy programming.  I also plan to hook up an external 24 inch display to the laptop when at my desk. Which MacBook should I choose? Any other better options?   <answer133132> Here is a new one:  13-inch: 2.6GHz with Retina display Specifications  precode2.6GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 Turbo Boost up to 3.1GHz 8GB 1600MHz memory 512GB PCIe-based flash storage1 Intel Iris Graphics Built-in battery (9 hours)2  $1,799.00  /code/pre  And Apple refurbished (almost the same) but saves $230!  precodeRefurbished 13.3-inch MacBook Pro 2.9GHz  Dual-core Intel Core i7 with Retina Display Originally released October 2012 13.3-inch (diagonal) Retina display; 2560-by-1600 resolution at 227 pixels per inch  8GB of 1600MHz DDR3L SDRAM  512GB Flash Storage 720p FaceTime HD Camera  Intel HD Graphics 4000  $1,569.00 /code/pre  <answer133133> The current MacBook Air, and the prior model MacBook Pro are nearly the same in terms of specs.  One difference is that the Air comes only with an SSD, while the MacBook Pro offers spinning hard drives. The newer Macbook Pro Retina also has only SSD.  Otherwise, the Air and Pro have Core i5 or i7 CPU available, 4 or 8GB memory options, and Intel 4000 GPU. These specs will be fine for development. The Retina Macbook has a newer GPU, the Intel Iris.  The downside of the Air and Retina models is that there are zero upgrade options after purchase. You can not replace or upgrade the SSD or the Memory. If you purchase a 128GB with 4GB of memory, you might regret it later when you are out of storage. (My iTunes folder is 349GB!)  However, with the Macbook Pro model, you can replace the hard drive, upgrade memory, even add another disk or SSD by removing the DVD unit. Much more flexibility with the Macbook Pro model.  <comment157731> Apple sells refurbished with warranty for a decent price. http://store.apple.com/us/mac <comment157732> So MBAir would be the newest model? <comment157733> sorry wrong link browse this one instead http://store.apple.com/us/browse/home/specialdeals/mac <comment157737> I've bought a 4GB 128GB Macbook Pro Retina and it's awesome. <comment157738> If you're going to use an external monitor you should really think about if you want retina or not. If  you don't use it, don't pay for it. <comment157740> $1199 it is . And we don't have apple stores in our country. <comment157741> @dwightk yeah, the $999 or $1199 one. (Refer link) <comment157742> This question appears to be off-topic because it is about a primarily opinion based hardware shopping choice.
