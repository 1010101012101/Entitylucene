Adding invitees to an calendar event after the event has been created <body> I can not find a way to add an invitee after the event has been created and the invite emails sent. Is it possible?  Below is the already created event, where I do not see the field to "add invitees" any more:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qjYlO.png" width="286" alt="This is the already created event, and I do not see anymore 'add invitees'"  Here is an event that has not yet been created, thus possible to add invitees:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/chY4J.png" width="280" alt="This is the event that has not yet been created, thus possible to add invitees"  EDIT: I use Exchange as the backend for the calendar... though had same issues with Google Calendar as backend as well.  Using Calendar Version 9.0 (2155.15)  <answer266537> If you click on the list of invitees, there should be an "Add Invitees" field which appears below the list.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/G5MuO.png" width="330"img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1FeRe.png" width="330"  <comment335081> But for some reason I do not see Add Invitees field, like it is shown for you.
