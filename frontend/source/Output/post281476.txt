youtube stops when i close ipad case <body> I stream youtube meditation video on bluetooth earbuds while going to sleep. I close the case and it stops so I open it and restart. runs all night!!! until a few days ago. now when I reopen the case and restart it goes back to home screen and shuts off the stream. I have not updated recently. I have made no changes nor have I done anything different.How do I resolve this issue?  <answer281477> YouTube prevents you from listening to music in the background unless you pay for YouTube Red.   You can circumvent this issue by using YouTube in Safari at youtube.com instead of in the YouTube app.  <answer281484> You might want to try changing your auto lock/unlock settings especially if you have a smart cover:  Go to Settings - General- iPad Cover Lock / Unlock option.  Sound like you want it turned off :)  <comment354175> You can use an app called Musi it works on my iPhone anyways.
