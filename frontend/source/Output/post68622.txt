How can I encrypt a large external drive? <body> I am using a LaCie 3 TB internal drive in a Sharkoon Quickport. The dock is USB 3 and I'm on a retina MacBook Pro with Mountain Lion. The drive is encrypted with TrueCrypt.  OS X won't format the drive as HFS+ Journaled and encrypted as the block size is not divisible by 512. Block sizes are 4096 for the docking station and 512 bytes for an external case. TrueCrypt gives me similar errors on my system, saying it doesn't support the block size. With Windows on the same machine, I don't have any problem.  How can I reformat the drive as HFS+?  <comment79736> What partition mapping are you using?
