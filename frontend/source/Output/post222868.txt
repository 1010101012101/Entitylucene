How can I get "Do Something When" functionality in Yosemite? <body> I have loved the power of the Do Something When preference pane in the past, to trigger things when certain USB drives were plugged in. But it no longer seems available. Certainly http://www.azarhi.com/Projects/DSW/ is defunct.   Does it still exist for Yosemite, or is there an alternative out there?  <comment270332> Have you tried creating a basic script with Automator? <comment270663> I'm not aware of any automator action to do with mounting volumes (which is what's going on when a USB drive is inserted). Are you? If so, I agree that would be a way to proceed.
