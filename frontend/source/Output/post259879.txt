repairing hard disk in single use mode. 2010 macbook pro, snow leopard <body> Before spending money to replace the Hard Drive (or buy Disk Warrior, related applications, go to apple store...etc.), I would like to explore other options for repairing it.   Having ran fsck in single user mode with the different options available (-fy ...etc) , the same errors : "invalid node structure," "incorrect number of thread records (4, 23745)" persist.   Additionally, I've ran "applejack" in single user mode and successfully repaired permissions, cleaned up cache(s), ran disk utility.  Problem still exists.     Also running bootcamp/windows 7 and am able to successfully boot this OS (selecting the partition from holding down "option" at pwr on).    From current evidence, I do not believe there to be a physical issue with the drive. The windows partition has booted fine for over a year (in spite of not being able to boot Snow Leopard).  Without reinstalling OSX or upgrading to the most recent version, I'm wondering how else I can go about solving the logical issue with current tools at hand.  Thanks!      <comment325210> Using Terminal, execute the following commands:  `diskutil verifyDisk disk0`  then when that's done, execute the command `diskutil info disk0 | grep -i smart`  Then post the output to your question.
