Letters / text that I type shows up in the wrong order <body> I've been having this issue for a while now, very inconsistently. When I type strands of text, sometimes the letters appears in the wrong order (I remember it mostly happening when I type text in Safari). One example:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/faIU8.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongemI typed "Install Canon Printer"./em/strong  I am using an iMac (21.5-inch, Mid 2011) running 10.10.5, with this keyboard:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wTlZ6.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  They keyboard is plugged directly into the iMac (no hub).  subNote: Sometimes I type things wrong, but AFAIK I'm not dyslexic./sub  <comment277895> Are the letters appearing one by one in the wrong order, or is what you are typing being autocorrected by the app or os?  Check Edit  Spelling and Grammar and make sure "correct spelling automatically" is off and see if it still happens.  Though it hardly seems like autocorrect would generate the example you show.... <comment277901> There's actually a lag in them appearing. Like they appear by bulk. I'm thinking it has to do with packs of data being sent to the computer through USB and arriving in the wrong order but I can't explain... Hardware is in excellent condition. "Correct spelling automatically" is OFF. <comment277908> It would be helpfui if you could try another keyboard and see if the same thing occurs with that, either usb or bluetooth. <comment277910> Thanks, I have another bluetooth keyboard, I'll try that for a while and get back here
