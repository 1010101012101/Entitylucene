Is there a Terminal command to get the current front most app's title? <body> I'm using Ãœbersicht and I've created a custom menubar. I want to show the title of the current active app but my search-fu isn't great. I must be searching for it incorrectly so I figured I'd ask here.  Does such a command exist?  <answer283454> Well there is, however if you run it directly in Terminal it's just going to return Terminal, as that's the frontmost application process that's visible.  precodeosascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to get name of application processes whose frontmost is true and visible is true' /code/pre  If you want the second most, use:  precodeosascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to get name of second application process whose visible is true' /code/pre  <comment357363> If you're in Terminal, then Terminal is the frontmost app... <comment357364> Your answer, my comment - seconds apart ;-) I do have an answer here somewhere that finds the 'second frontmost' by Applescript - I'll have to try find it... <comment357365> Yeah, I was going to write it as a comment however if he's calling it in a script that's running in the background then it might have some use. :) <comment357366> Yup, it works perfectly. Awesome!
