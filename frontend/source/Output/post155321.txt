How to disable the menubar form showing when hovering with the mouse <body> It is very annoying that the menubar automatically appears when I hover the upper area of the screen with the mouse.  I do not want the menubar to show Just with the mouse, but rather add another keyboard key for example so that when clicked and the cursor is on the top of the screen the menubar will then appear.  Any suggestion how to disable the menu bar from showing with the mouse placement?  (I'm using Yosemite if that matters!)  <comment182697> By default, the menu bar is not able to be hidden.
