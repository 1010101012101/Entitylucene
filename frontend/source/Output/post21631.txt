What is the best dropbox compatible iPad app for MS office documents? <body> It's pretty simple. I just got an iPad and want to get the best app to edit word documents that I have saved in my dropbox. There are many options: pages, quick office, docs to go, office2.  I am looking to be able to browse documents within DropBox and tap edit to open them in the editor. I'll make a few changes and expect to be able to tap save and have it automatically update DropBox.   <answer21634> My father uses DocsToGo and he´s happy. But he doesn't have a mac. But he said that it works very well for him.  <answer21662> I'm a professional writer, I've tried out a bunch of these apps, and I prefer Dataviz’s Documents to Go Premium, which creates and edits Microsoft Office documents (Word, Excel, PowerPoint). The great thing about the Premium version (and justifies the extra $6 over the basic version) is that it connects with the Dropbox online storage service. Documents to Go does a good job of editing Word documents, including maintaining styles, etc.  <answer100919> Quickoffice is a great app, but it no longer supports Dropbox.   <answer133240> Documents To Go now trumps QuickOffice after QO dropped support for Dropbox. Also has a more friendly and flexible interface.   <comment23816> Dropbox Integration is pretty basic - you either use the default folder, it picks a folder or you can pick a folder. It's just webDAV as well. Do make a stab at editing the criteria for best word editor. Best for me is iA Writer simple - best for another might be a kitchen sing of features. Best is so vague and subjective without context of you and your expectations. <comment23839> For me, "best" is: I can view documents in the dropbox app, tap "edit" to open them in an editing program, make some changes and hitting "save" will automatically update the dropbox. <comment23841> Excellent - I've edited that into the question. Feel free to add more information by editing your question if you don't get the answer you like after a bit. <comment23842> I'll second Documents to Go as an awesome product that makes a lot of people appreciate the premium version. It's a great value. <comment118809> Which means it doesn't answer the question. <comment118817> Are you meaning to tell someone to rule this out as a choice or that it's so good that you should ditch dropbox and use another solution that you propose? (_i.e. at least provide a complete solution when you're going to change a premise of the question_)
