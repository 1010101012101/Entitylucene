I deleted the update file for iOS 9.3. Is it possible to reinstall it? <body> I was having trouble installing the new iOS 9.3 on my iPhone 5 and I got the advice that I should delete the update file and try to reinstall it. The problem is now that I have deleted the file I can't find the update file for iOS 9.3 again. I have restarted the phone but it didn't help, it says I have the latest update (9.2.1). Is it possible to install iOS 9.3 now?  Update: I got the new update today randomly. The installation of 9.3 went successfull.  <answer232693> Several sites host the ipsw file for 9.3.  That's similar to a zip file but it's for ios.  You can do a simple google search for sites but you need to be careful and make sure the file hasn't been messed with.  I often go to OSXDaily.com to get my files.  From there you can download the 9.3 file and install it following the instructions. This will update your iPhone to 9.3.  <answer232696> Apple has pulled the iOS 9.3 update for some (older) devices because of a bug that could prevent using your device. Apple is not signing iOS 9.3 for your iPhone (5s and older), so strongit is not possible to update by official means at this time/strong. According to the link below, 9.3 could potentially brick an older phone under certain conditions.

Not the first report of that this week. <comment284342> I have tried that aswell. Itunes says i have the latest update which is 9.2.1. <comment284343> Golden rule: Don't use any site that hosts it themselves. use one that merely links to the Apple hosted version. OSXDaily is one of the latter & quite safe - example link for the 6s... http://appldnld.apple.com/iOS9.3/031-20814-20160321-50FF38D4-EAA8-11E5-AAA8-C479BD379832/iPhone8,1_9.3_13E234_Restore.ipsw <comment284353> I don't remember having to enter the Apple ID and password used to originally set up the device when i tried to download it so i guess not. It just said something about the update couldn't be installed because i "lost my internet connection" when i know for a fact i there was nothing wrong with my internet connection. Just weird. <comment284409> What device are you using? What iPhone? <comment284411> I have the Iphone 5 <comment284537> http://ipsw.me is the best site for IPSWs.
