How do I delete files open in Preview? <body> I'm having an issue with "Preview" on the Mac. When I open a document with it, I can't find the button to delete it while in preview. What I have to do now is open Launchpad to drag the document to the Trash. Does anyone know how to delete a file while in Preview?  <answer268290> According to this answer, you can't delete the last file that's open in a Preview window:     Preview won't allow you to cmd-delete, or "move to trash", or even drag and drop to trash, the last file it has open.   If there is more than one PDF open in a single Preview window however, you can delete them up until the last one.
