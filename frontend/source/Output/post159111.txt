Network issues since upgrading to Yosemite - Unable to find local systems <body> I am on a Windows corporate network. Since I've upgraded my MacBook Pro (2014) to Yosemite from Mavericks, I am unable to find local machines on our network via DNS.  ul liI can get onto my corporate network./li liI can connect to any machine, webpage, server throughout the world via the DNS name. ( I can connect to Google, Yahoo, etc. with no problems)/li liI can find local systems via the IP address./li /ul  What I cannot do is find our local systems via DNS names. For example, I can codeping 10.1.0.233/code but I cannot codeping flubert.prod.local/code even though that machine's IP address is 10.1.0.233.  This is an issue for many of us Macheads. Many haven't upgraded from Mavericks to Yosemite because of this issue.  <answer159113> I don't have that issue.  Did you try flushing the DNS cache?  Open a terminal and run this code:  precodesudo discoveryutil udnsflushcaches /code/pre  Is your DNS server listed in you network preferences under Advanced  DNS ? If not, add the ip address of your DNS server there.  <answer159127> This is very common problem in split-horizon DNS and heterogenous but Windows-dominated company networks. A lot of Windows sysadmins are used to the .local TLD as a valid private TLD name since at least a decade though it's not RFC-compliant anymore.    When your local area network has been configured with a domain name ending in .local, then all LAN hostname resolutions queried by a Mac will be passed to mDNS first - bypassing unicast DNS!  So hostname resolutions for .local often fail in Mac OS X applications (Safari, Chrome etc and often ping).  In contrary dig and nslookup are unicast DNS utilities, so they will both bypass the system hostname resolution order (files-mDNS-DNS) and query unicast DNS directly.  Some workarounds exist (your mileage will vary):    ul liflush DNS cache frequently/li liadd codeprod.local/code as search domain (to add codelocal/code additionally is sometimes advised as well)/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EKxSg.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  IMHO the only proper and RFC-compliant way to fix this is changing the local domain names to use a TLD other than .local in your Windows corporate network.  <comment187021> Yes, I've tried flushing the caches. The DNS servers listed match the ones on my Windows machine when I run `ipconfig /all`. I was told it had something to do with Bonjour. <comment187023> Ironically, I'm also running a new Windows 7 PC via Parallels on my Mac and sharing my network connection. That PC, even though it isn't on the corporate domain can find the local machines that my Mac cannot. <comment187026> According to [this](https://coderwall.com/p/ylchfq/osx-yosemite-bonjour-mdnsresponder-problems) page, Bonjour was replaced in Yosemite.  How about: sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.discoveryd.plist   and  sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.discoveryd.plist <comment187045> That did it. Amazingly, if I am on the public network, and then use Cisco Anyconnect to connect to my corporate network, I could use DNS for the local machines. In fact, this is what I had to do when I worked with my Mac for the last two weeks. It caused all sorts of problems because Jabber/Messages and my Voip phone via X-Lite caused problems if I had the VPN running. This makes my life so much easier!
