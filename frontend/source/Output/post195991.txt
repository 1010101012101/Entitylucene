Why am I seeing captive portal requests on my home network? <body> I have suddenly started getting prompts on my 2014 Mavericks MBP (10.9.5) every five minutes that bring up a page with HTML like the following:  precode&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;&lt;TITLE&gt;Success&lt;/TITLE&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;&lt;BODY&gt;Success&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt; /code/pre  At the bottom of this modal window is a url:  precodehttp://www.apple.com/library/test/success.html /code/pre  I am on my home network which uses an Airport Extreme running 7.6.4.  I did not make any known configuration changes to either my computer or my network.  Why am I suddenly seeing this page, which other posts suggest is a captive portal test?  I saw another question that demonstrated how to disable the Captive Network Assistant, but as I do take my computer to hotels that use these portals, I'm reluctant to jump straight to that.  Instead, is there something on my Airport that is generating/blocking these all of a sudden and it shouldn't be?  I tried a factory reset of the Airport and I'm still seeing this issue.  How can I configure my network so I stop getting these annoying popups?  <answer196104> The page has now been corrected, which should mean that the popup no longer occurs.  <comment234060> Seems like the only common denominator is Mac OS 10.9.5 - only users in our office with 10.9.5 see it, haven't updated any other software. <comment234070> I noticed this just now too. I think apple broke something, that URL is returning the HTML as entity encoded ie "&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;&lt;TITLE&gt;Success&lt;/TITLE&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;&lt;BODY&gt;Success&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;"  This is broken on my friends' iPhone 4 running iOS 6.something, I got around the problem by turning off "auto-login" <comment234076> I have raised a bug with apple (I have a developer account), with bug number: 21832176.  Hopefully they fix it soon. <comment234082> I have the same issue: OS X 10.9.5 . No update was installed by me. <comment234179> So there was an error on the test page that was causing this? <comment234271> Amazingly enough, that's my conclusion. Have to say, this seems like a rather unstable implementation, but hey, what do I know... I'm only a web dev! <comment238826> Yes, there was an error on the apple page, I finally got a response from Apple Developer Relations and they told me "Can you please verify and see if this issue still happening?  We have changed something server side.".  Obviously they fixed it a long time ago now.
