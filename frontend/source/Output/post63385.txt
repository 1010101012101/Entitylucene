Going from sub/superscript to regular baseline with keyboard shortcut in Keynote <body> I use mathematical notation a lot. Therefore being able to cntrl+cmd+"+" and cntrl+cmd+- to write super- and subscript is a productivity boon. However, to return to the regular font baseline I need to use the mouse and menubar. Is there a keyboard shortcut that lets me return to using the regular font baseline?  Ps. You can copy some regular text before entering sub/superscript mode and then paste it afterwards to return to regular baseline, however that is a slight hassle.  <answer63387> Pressing ⌃⌘+ or ⌃⌘- again seems to remove superscript or subscript in Keynote '09.  Other applications like TextEdit raise or lower the text multiple times though.  You could give custom shortcuts to nested menu items on 10.7, but it stopped working on 10.8.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/y0dJ0.png" alt=""  Another option would be to create ~/Library/KeyBindings/ and save a property list like this as DefaultKeyBinding.dict, but it doesn't seem to work in iWork applications.  precode{     "^@=" = unscript:; } /code/pre  You could also assing a shortcut to a script like this:  precodetry     tell application "System Events" to tell (process 1 where it is frontmost)         click menu item "Use Default" of menu 1 of menu item "Baseline" of menu 1 of menu item "Font" of menu "Format" of menu bar 1     end tell end try /code/pre  <comment73291> Derpaderp.
