open new terminal tab in the same directory with the active tab <body> In GNOME Terminal of Ubuntu when you open a new tab the new shell will automatically start you in the current working directory of the active tab shell.  E.g. if in the active tab shell I am on code~/myproject/code and I open a new tab, the new shell will start on code~/myproject/code too.  As you can guess, this is very convenient when you work deep in the directory hierarchy.  Can I configure the OSX terminal to have this behaviour?   If not, is there any free (cocoa) terminal that does this?  <answer11018> h2Here's my solution from a SuperUser question/h2  hr  Get the current environment in your clipboard:  precodeenv | pbcopy /code/pre  Open up a new Terminal window and export those environment variables  precodefor env in `pbpaste`; do export $env; done /code/pre  And to ease the process, you could always alias it, like so  precodealias get_env="env | pbcopy" alias set_env="for env in `pbpaste`; do export $env; done" /code/pre  So that all you have to do is     get_env kbdâŒ˜/kbd+kbdN/kbd set_env   hr  The accepted solution:  precode#!/bin/sh  osascript &lt;&lt;END  tell app "Terminal" to do script "cd \"`pwd`\""  END /code/pre  Place it in one of the folders in your path, make it executable (codechmod +x filename/code). You can then run the name of this script to open a new terminal window in the same directory.  <answer11021> You may use iTerm2 and just select in preferences to "reuse previous tab's directory"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bCOmV.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer166602> In recent OS X versions (Mavericks and Yosemite, not sure about earlier versions) in the Terminal.app preferences, "General" tab, there are options for "New windows open with" and "New tabs open with":  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iDE0D.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment11536> I also recommend using iTerm2 as a Terminal replacement. I did come from the linux world, and finding a good gnome-terminal replacement for mac was a must. <comment11609> The `osascript` approach is nice. But it opens the shell in a new window instead of a new tab. <comment11611> Looks nice! Thanks! <comment72257> I'd like to add that this behavior can be configured in recent versions of Terminal.app as well.
