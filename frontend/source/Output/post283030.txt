XQuartz Gnuplot Mac Sierra trackpad issue <body> I'm using Mac Sierra and plot with XQuartz Gnuplot version 5.0. I can plot but after that not much else with the plot. I cannot zoom, double click to get coordinates to clipboard etc (and all the other keyboard commands don't work) as it is said in gnuplot bind that it should.  I have a trackpad without any extra buttons on it so I guess this is where the issue arises (I have checked/unchecked "emulate three button mouse" nothing helps). Any suggestions on how to fix this so I can zoom parts of the plot like they do on those d#mn smoothly working linux computers?
