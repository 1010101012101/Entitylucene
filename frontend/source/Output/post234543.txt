Time Capsule hangs during restore since OS X 10.11, El Capitan <body> I have been backing up my iMac to a Time Capsule using Time Machine happily for several years and when needed I have been able to restore items.  However since "upgrade" to OS X 10.11, El Capitan, there is a problem opening backups.  The system still appears to back up normally but when I enter Time Machine to try to restore a file the "Finder" part of the Time Machine operation seems to hang and not open or find the back up files.  Any ideas please ?
