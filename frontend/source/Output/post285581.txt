How do I connect my iMac to a Windows SMB share drive <body> I work in an organization that runs a Windows network of 1000s of computers with Windows 7 installed. We have lots of SMB share drives that store information. My job is a new role for a graphic design area and I've been setup with an iMac.   strongNow the problem:/strong This is the only iMac in the organization and I'm not familiar with share drives. I've been told that I've had my "credentials" set up and should be able to connect to an SMB share drive that contains all our fonts, images, and videos.  strongHow do I connect my iMac to this Windows SMB share drive?/strong  <answer285583> This answer assumes a few things:  ul liyour iMac is already connected to the network (most likely via ethernet)/li lithat your credentials are all setup (based on your question, they are)/li lithat you’ve been given the host address for the share drive/li /ul  To connect to the share drive, you should only have to:  ol liMake sure the Finder is active/li liPress kbdcommand/kbdkbdK/kbd (or, in the top menubar, click on Go and select the strongConnect to Server…/strong option)/li liA emConnect to Server/em window will appear with a Server Address field/li liIn this field enter the host address (it should start with strongsmb:///strong)/li liClick on the kbdConnect/kbd button/li liYou should now be connected and able to access all the files via the Finder/li /ol  strongNote:/strong - If you’re not already connected to the network, or you require different credentials for this share drive, then after Step 5 you may be prompted to enter your username and password.  strong[EDIT]/strong  If you do have to enter your username and password, it's likely you will need to enter the username in the form of "DOMAIN\username" where "DOMAIN" is the name of your Active Directory domain. If you're unsure of this, your IT helpdesk should be able to tell you.  <answer285584> Your IT department shouldn't have just abandoned you at this point. They should have worked through it with you.  We can't really answer this without knowing more detail of the network setup there, but the basic premise would be to start frombr Finder  Go  Connect to Server...br simply type codesmb://[address you should have already been given]/code &amp; hit Enter.  Corporate networking is really beyond the scope of Ask Different &amp; ought to be handled by your own IT team.  <comment360232> Note that you can use the IP address of the server or the name of the server. When it asks for your username and password you will likely need to enter the username in the form of "DOMAIN\username" where "DOMAIN" is the name of your Active Directory domain. Failing to qualify the username like that might lead to the login failing. <comment360269> That's typical of Windows only IT departments.  Don't want to deal with the Mac. <comment360344> @Harper Exactly. I come across this all the time. I often think they're a little _scared_ of Macs! LOL In any case, Tetsujin is 100% correct - they really shouldn't have abandoned the OP. You would think that it being the first Mac in the organisation they'd be a bit more keen to learn about it. Odds are it won't be the last Mac now! :) <comment360345> @SteveChambers Good point! I totally forgot to mention that in my answer, although the OP seems to have sorted it. :)
