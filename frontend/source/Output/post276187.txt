Remote desktop into macOS from Windows <body> I am doing some development on my MacBook and I would like to use my desktop to access it remotely as I have a dual monitor setup. Is there a way to do this? My desktop is Windows and my Mac is a 2015 Retina MacBook Pro.   <answer276191> Download RealVNC Viewer for Windows and move it to the applications folder.  In the macOS open System Preferences  Sharing and enable "Screen Sharing" for either emAll users/em or restrict it to your user.  Open RealVNC Viewer and enter the IP or the host name of the Mac and hit the enter key.  <answer276211> Another option is TeamViewer. You can setup TeamViewer with "unattended access". Be sure to use a really good password, but this should do the trick for you. You can read more about it here: https://www-rc.teamviewer.com/en/use-cases/remote-access/  <comment347569> Does RealVNC allow for multi monitor output through rdp? Or do I have to get a cable?
