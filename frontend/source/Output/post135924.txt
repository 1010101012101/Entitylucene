Apple Mail squeezes photographs from one address <body> Left: How it looked in the email I received. Right: Copied and pasted into a new email  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cKf20.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  This happens with every photo I receive from this one guy, nobody else. The pic will open with a normal aspect in every other app I've tried--Photoshop CC, Preview.  Any ideas?  <comment161154> What email is that one guy using <comment161182> Says he "formats the articles using AOL." I assume that means he just composes an email in AOL and attaches the pics.
