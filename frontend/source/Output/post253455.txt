Iphone 6 Plus lock screen <body> I just got my Iphone 6 plus and there is no option to click on for auto lock. How do I set my time for auto lock?  <answer253458> You can find the Auto-Lock option by following these steps:  ol liSettings/li liDisplay &amp; Brightness/li liAuto-Lock/li /ol  Here you'll have the option to change your phone to Auto-Lock from 30 seconds to 5 minutes. You can also choose Never to stop Auto-Lock from happening. If you use Low Power Mode, Auto-Lock will be automatically set to 30 seconds.
