Is there a way to show total number of "all day" events on BusyCal or Google Cal? <body> Alright so I don't think there's a quick fix for my question... but maybe someone has an answer or alternative solution. I work at a dog training place, and we use BusyCal to schedule our training dogs as well as our daycare dogs. The daycare dogs we mark as "all day" so they are in horizontal rows if you're in the "Day" view of the calendar. And for the dogs who are in training, we make an event for a week or two long so that if you're in the "Day" view, the training dogs are in columns across the bottom.   We take 15 training dogs a day, and 15 daycare dogs each day. we always have customers calling like "do  you have room on this day for my fur baby to come in for daycare??" and we have to go to the day and count the number of dogs scheduled for daycare one by one, which takes FOREVER when you're on the phone and they ask about multiple days and each day you have to count the dogs/events one by one....   MY QUESTION IS: Is there a way to show the total number of "all day" events in a day so I can quickly say "yes we have room" or "no i'll put you on the waiting list"?  Does that make sense? I'm not sure how to easily explain what I'm asking. I also tried to use Google Calendar and I couldn't find the option there either. But any help would be greatly appreciated!!! (P.S. I guess we used to use iCal but it got too overloaded and crashed and lost everything because we had too many events. so ical isn't an option lol)  (let me know if you need clarification on anything lol)
