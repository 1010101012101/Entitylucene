Should I format and upgrade to mavericks or upgrade to mavericks and format? <body> I am planning to upgrade on a Unibody Macbook (2008) to Mavericks. Mountain Lion is already installed and I felt it to be a bit sluggish when I upgraded. I also would like to start anew and clear some files that have been on the machine for a few years. So I am wondering:  ol liWould you advise formatting on Mountain Lion, adding files and apps back then upgrade to Mavericks?/li liWould you advise formatting on Mountain Lion upgrading to Mavericks and adding files and apps back to the Macbook?/li liWould you advise upgrading to Mavericks then formatting and then format then add files back?/li /ol  <answer123188> You could pick this route:  ol liBack-up everything you need/li liFormat your disk (this will format/clean Mountain Lion and all files)/li liInstall a clean version of Mavericks/li liPut back the files you still need/li /ol  strongWhy this way?/strong br/ Easy, you won't have the emold/em Mountain Lion files on your file system. This results in a clean new environment to start with.br / The other methods you described will result in Mavericks on top of Mountain Lion.  <comment146523> Did my answer help you out? <comment163570> It has afraid I haven't done it yet but will say this is the right answer.
