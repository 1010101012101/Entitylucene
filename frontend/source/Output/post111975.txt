Two computers to one new one using time machine <body> I want to transfer both my computers info to the new one.  I did it, but it came out in two different places.  Can I merger the two?  <answer112385> strong(It probably goes without saying, but I haven't actually tried this myself. YMMV. Make backups before you start this. Use at your own risk, etc.)/strong  You probably can, but if there are conflicts between them, one of them will have to be the designated 'winner'.  The easiest way to do this is probably to run code/Applications/Utilities/Migration Assistant.app/code twice. Whichever one you run last will overwrite any of the existing settings from the other one.  A more complicated way to do this would be to use codersync/code to move the files to the same destination, however it should be noted that codersync/code is one of the Un*x tools which is hugely powerful emand/em very easy to misuse to disastrous effect. Be sure that you have a separate backup of these files before you try to use codersync/code on them.  A third option would be to use Transmit which has the ability to move folders and merge them. You'll have to decide which one 'wins' but itâ€™s probably a more granular approach than Migration Assistant without getting into the complexity of codersync/code.
