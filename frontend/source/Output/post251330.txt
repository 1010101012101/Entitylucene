Bluetooth device keeps showing up even after I added it to ignored bluetooth devices <body> My coworker's Macbook Air keeps connecting to my laptop. This interrupts my bluetooth keyboard and magic trackpad. I turned off codeSystem Integrity/code and codechown/codeed code/Library/preferences/com.apple.Bluetooth.plist/code. I then took my coworker's mac address and added it to codeIgnoredDevices/code.  Unfortunately, the Macbook Air keeps connecting. Would it help if I added my mac address to my coworker's codeIgnoredDevices/code? Anyway, it's driving me nuts and I don't know what to do. Any help is appreciated.
