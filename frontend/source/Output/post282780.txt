How do I install a specific release of a Homebrew formula on GitHub? <body> I am trying to install a specific version of Buck using Homebrew. Facebook provide a formula on GitHub.   I have added the tap:   precodebrew tap facebook/fb /code/pre  I can then install Buck using:   precodebrew install --HEAD facebook/fb/buck /code/pre  However, I would like to install a specific release, for example v2017.05.02.01.   What is the syntax for installing a specific release from GitHub?   I am looking for something like:   precode# This does not work!  brew install --v2017.05.02.01 facebook/fb/buck /code/pre  emNote: other questions do not seem to be about releases on GitHub./em  <answer283266> Not sure whether this is a good idea or not, but it does seem like you can install from an older commit.  So for example the following command seems to work to download, build and install version 2017.05.02.01 of buck. Note that it will try to download and compile from source because the binaries have been deleted from the repo.  codebrew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/facebook/homebrew-fb/7511722fd58e999e5d8c3a415d4e8cd1deee8f21/buck.rb/code  I got to this by:  ol liGoing into the commit history of homebrew-fb/li liClicking on the &lt; button for the "Update buck.rb to v2017.05.02.01" commit to take me into the repository as it existed with that commit/li liSelecting the buck.rb file/li liAnd lastly clicking the "Raw" button to get the url directly to that specific version of the buck.rb/li /ol  <comment357096> This is actually the workaround I posted on the Buck issue tracker :)
