Get cpu usage per core on the command line <body> Activity monitor allows users to see the cpu usage on a per-core basis (for multicore machines, e.g. my MacBook Pro).  Is there a way to find the percent usage of each core/processor via the command line?  <answer94914> I've installed htop for this purpose. In order to install on OS X (10.8.4), I used homebrew, which installed the htop package (codebrew install htop/code).  Despite the fact that this is via the command line, it is still a graphical output within the terminal.   <answer226795> To install htop on OS X El Capitan follow these easy steps:  Copy and paste the following commands into a terminal window:  precodecurl -O http://themainframe.ca/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/htop.zip unzip htop.zip sudo mv htop /usr/local/bin rm htop.zip /code/pre  Run htop by entering codehtop/code into Terminal  <comment111289> Thanks!  This program is awesome, it also seems to use about 5 times less CPU than `top`.  For the record MacPorts also has a version of `htop` which works for OS X 10.8 `port install htop` <comment289963> There's no good reason to do that. That fork is 7 years old and fairly glitchy. htop 2 is out with proper OS X support, so just get it through brew. And make sure to install the "htop" package and not "htop-osx" (that's the same outdated fork).
