OS X copy paste into Terminal adds fdbf bfb9 b083 to beginning and end of selection <body> For the life of me, I can't figure this out.  When using a browser (doesnt matter which), if I select text, then paste in Vim or Neovim, I see characters added to the beginning and end of my selection.  For example, I select "answer" from this page, then paste it over in Terminal I get:  ??????answer?????? Saving this pasted data to file with .bin extension and then opening in Vim with this auto command helper:  precodeaugroup Binary    au!    au BufReadPre  *.bin let &amp;bin=1    au BufReadPost *.bin if &amp;bin | %!xxd    au BufReadPost *.bin set ft=xxd | endif    au BufWritePre *.bin if &amp;bin | %!xxd -r    au BufWritePre *.bin endif    au BufWritePost *.bin if &amp;bin | %!xxd    au BufWritePost *.bin set nomod | endif augroup END /code/pre  I get this output:  precode0000000: fdbf bfb9 b083 616e 7377 6572 fdbf bfb9  ......answer.... 0000010: b083 0a                                ... /code/pre  So, you can see that I get  precodefdbf bfb9 b083 /code/pre  added to the beginning, and I get  precodefdbf bfb9 b083 /code/pre  added to the end.  Any ideas on what this is about?  The only recent major change I can remember is upgrading OS X to Yosemite, so sure that's potentially a large update.  I suspect Terminal is the source of the issue. I've been able to use iTerm2 without this problem.  Also, I have tried to select "answer" from this page and then in both iTerm2 and Terminal I run this command:  precodepbpaste|od -x /code/pre  which gives me  precode0000000 6e61 7773 7265 0000006 /code/pre  So, the clipboard has "answer" and pbpasting it in both iTerm2 and Terminal gives the same output, but cmd-V pasting into nano, stock vi (with -u NONE), MacVim (with -u NONE) and Neovim all give me a the ?????? displayed and then on save, encode the fdbf stuff into the file.

Neovim does not support it yet[2]. You get the error above if an application acts like it can support that mode, but fails to support it.  In neovim open a terminal window. With 'always' in the clipboard, run the following:  precodepbpaste | xxd /code/pre  There should be no errors. Now run the following:  precodecat | xxd /code/pre  Enter âŒ˜-v followed by Ctrl-D.  You should expect to see the errors. In the second case, input is being handled by the application, which wraps the input with special bytes. The padded bytes are sent as stdin.  <comment280178> Can you give a summary of the linked site? If the site/link dies, your answer is worth nothing.
