Ubuntu-like bash completion in Mac OS X? <body> I work in the terminal a fair bit, and one thing I really miss from the servers I usually work on is the comprehensive autocompletion bash provides on Ubuntu servers.  Are there any readymade tools that will add a similar level of completion to my Mac; containing at the very least command line arguments for built-in system utilities and developer tools (like git, xcodebuild, etc.)?  <answer27333> The easiest way is to install codebash-completion/code from homebrew and follow the provided instructions.
