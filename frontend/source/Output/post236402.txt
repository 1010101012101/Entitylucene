Open programs at random time with applescript <body> I was wondering how I can make a harmless "fake" virus to prank a friend. I am using Applescript Editor. The prank is going to open Safari at any random time. I know how to open Safari with Applescript but it's the random part i don't know how to do.   If someone knows how I can do it PLEASE tell me.   <answer236548> Use coderandom number from __ to __/code and ifs.  For example:  precoderepeat     if random number from 0 to 100 = 0 then         #do thing     end if     delay 60 end repeat /code/pre  <comment289287> For me, it's easier in a shell.  'sleep' and '$RANDOM' <comment289292> Hopefully you will get a more complete answer.  I cannot be more specific without opening Terminal on the Mac (I am on iPad now).  But those are not Applescript, they are Unix shell.  When I get back to my Mac, if there is not already an answer, I will post. <comment289294> Tank You 3 @WGroleau <comment289628> Looks like an answer, so I can stop feeling guilty about not being able to get on my Mac.  :-) <comment289631> @WGroleau glad to hear it :) <comment289664> Thanx everyone...
