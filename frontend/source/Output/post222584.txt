Setup wifi access on iPhone when out of range <body> I want to setup a wifi connection on an iPhone 6S.  I have the SSID name and WPA password.  But the wifi access point is out of range.  It is not my phone.  I want to set up the wifi name and password so that when the access point is within range in the future, it autoconnects.  When I try to add the connection it complains that it cannot connect, so it is wrong, so it won't save it.  Is there a way?  So far the only way I found is to setup a local wifi hotspot with the same name and password and connect to that.  I am not sure it works.  <answer222610> Perhaps you can set up a temporary access point at your present location with the same SSID and password, then connect to that?  I do not know if the iPhone is going to save some other router-specific identifying information which would prevent connection at the other location, but if you have two routers available to you where you are it would be pretty easy to test.  <comment269807> As I said, that is exactly what I did but I don't know yet if it works.  I created a hotspot on my mac. <comment269818> you won't be able to add an encrypted (WPA) access point that is out of range because the first time connection is different than re-connect, and on a first time connect keys are negotiated and stored,  the password is never actually stored in the form you see it... it becomes and is stored as an encrypted key. <comment269926> Thanks.  I was afraid of something like that.  I am still waiting for the result of my try. <comment270369> OK, regarding my try, the wifi didn't work at all.  So I don't know if it would have connected.  But after Tyson's comment I'd say probably not.
