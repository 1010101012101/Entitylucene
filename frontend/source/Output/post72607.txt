ssh_exchange_identification: Connection closed <body> In university I normally SSH into the computer sciences server. However today I keep getting the following error: codessh_exchange_identification: Connection closed by remote host/code. SSHing with code-v/code flags gives me the following.  precodeOpenSSH_5.9p1, OpenSSL 0.9.8r 8 Feb 2011 debug1: Reading configuration data /etc/ssh_config debug1: /etc/ssh_config line 20: Applying options for * debug2: ssh_connect: needpriv 0 debug1: Connecting to ...

Any suggestions?  <answer72643> This can happen when you have too many different keys to offer. You can easily fix this by adding codeIdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_keyname/code to your code~/.ssh/config/code entry used for this connection and a global codeIdentitiesOnly yes/code. This can look like this:    code~/.ssh/config/code  precodeHost foo     hostname server.example.com     User myUserName     IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_keyname  Host *     IdentitiesOnly yes /code/pre  <answer177540> I ran into this same exact issue. My system log reflected:   precode/var/empty must be owned by root and not group or world-writable /code/pre  Going to codeDisk Utility &gt; Macintosh HD &gt; Repair Disk Permissions/code reset the permissions of code/var/empty/code and solved the problem for me.  <answer248360> Little snitch was the problem for me. codeRules &gt; Incoming connections/code  You must do this from the Little Snitch application's preferences.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BYUAY.jpg" alt="little snitch allow incoming ssh"  <comment323324> I ran into this issue when upgrading from El Capitan to Sierra. After changing the owner of /var/empty to root (`sudo chown root /var/empty/`), ssh works like a charm again. Thx! <comment355277> This description is not helpful. Where in MacOS (what edition of MacOS?) do I go to Rules  Incoming connections ?
