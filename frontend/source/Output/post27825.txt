Can I set the volume on my iPhone lower than the slider goes? <body> I have an iPhone 4S and some V-Moda in-ear headphones. The headphones have great volume and isolation, which is good when I'm listening to something quiet. But it's a problem on my iPhone.  When I play music on my iPhone with the headphones, it is strongvery loud/strong. As in, painfully loud when I put the volume slider in the middle. To  lower the volume, I (of course) dragged the volume slider to the left. The problem is that strongeven when I get all the way to the left, it is still very loud/strong. If I move it any further, the volume abruptly mutes.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1UPIt.png" alt=""  I've tried changing settings, and I've found that enabling Sound Check helps some louder songs. Unfortunately, Sound Check doesn't apply to apps like Spotify, which I use more than the Music app.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LptOD.png" width="300"  So, stronghow can I reduce the volume on my iPhone beyond the slider?/strong  strongNotes:/strong The volume is fine with the stock Apple headphones. Reducing the volume of the music itself (modifying the files) isn't an option because I need to reduce the volume of streaming audio and files I don't have access to (Spotify).  <answer29607> There's a plist you can edit to raise or reduce the amplification of the volume on a jailbroken device, however your question has the iphone-4s tag, so I'm assuming you're using a 4S, which means it won't be possible until a jailbreak is released for it.   iJailbreak has a tutorial of how to do this, but this should be easier:  ol liDownload iFile from Cydia. /li liOpen iFile and keep pressing the back arrow until the title bar says code//code./li liNavigate to code/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Celestial.framework/code (codeMobileToolbox.framework/code on iOS 5)/li liTap codeReigonalVolumeLimits.plist/code, followed by Property List Viewer./li liSet every value on the right to one of the following:  ul licode0,83/code (default)/li licode25/code (125% of the original volume)/li licode0,43/code (43% of the original volume)/li /ul  (Don't use code1/code, as it is known to use more battery life.)/li liSave your changes to the file./li liEither respring or reboot your device and the volume level will change./li /ol  You might not hear a difference through the phone's speaker, but you should when you use an external audio output.  If you don't want to jailbreak, you can also try playing music while changing the equalizer settings to one you like. I'm not sure if this has an effect on apps other than the stock ones, though.  <answer36645> There's a very simple solution for your problem.  Go to 'settings'  'Music'  Volume Limit. There you can limit the maximum volume. How lower the maximum volume, how smaller the increased or decreased volume difference when you click on the volume rocker.  <answer41179> I had the same issue. I went into settings, music, EQ and adjusted the Loudness setting. It is now softer / not as loud sounding.   <answer62942> I tried Volume master app ($0.99)  It says it increases the volume by 0.01dB - 0dB, 0.01dB, 0.02dB, etc while the default iPhone volume control goes from 0dB, 0.06dB, etc. I am not sure 0.01dB is low enough or it works with any app.  It feels a bit comfortable with 0.01dB even though I cannot tell the difference a lot between 0.06dB and 0.01dB.   <answer143200> Ok, so I finally have an answer of sorts! It's a hack, but... basically, you can create a custom EQ that simply lowers all frequencies by the same amount, which is the same as lowering the volume.   Step 1: Make your customer EQ in iTunes: Open up iTunes. Select Window  EQ. Then reduce the preamp volume (on the left hand side) to super low. If you want even more reduction, take each little slider, and reduce it real low, but make sure each one is reduced the exact same amount, or else you'll slightly alter the tone of the songs.  Step 2: Get that custom EQ onto your iPod!: Follow these instructions exactly from a different forum question: http://www.head-fi.org/t/399487/ipod-custom-eq-yes-it-can-be-done  Then when you want to reduce the volume of every song, just go (on your iPod) to Settings  EQ, and select your EQ setting! Boom!  <answer215397> I have active speakers without volume controls and stream via bluetooth.  The only way I have found to reduce the minimum volume is to get the Denon Audio app (free), then purchase the in app equaliser (Â£1.49), set the eq to flat and reduce all frequencies.  This can be saved as a custom setting.  I've tried the volume app and other EQs - they don't work.   <answer234756> There's no easy way to do this by standard means of iOS (current fresh iOS emv.9.3.1/em), without "jailbreaking" and intruding to the inner-workings of iOS.  h3Headsets with wire/h3  If are using strongheadsets with wire/strong, then we can blame higher/lower impedance difference in the headphones. High-impedance headsets would require higher signal levels to produce the same output level of low-impedance headphones.  The easiest solution you can do, would be to buy stronga volume attenuator/strong, which would have a little dial on adapter itself for adjusting the level.  h3Bluetooth headset, wireless/h3  But if you gotten strongBluetooth headset, wireless/strong, it works differently. Headset controls the volume level in "emelectronic/em-way", so it totally dependent on implementation of headsets and is dependent from manufacturer to manufacturer. The minimum volume would vary seriously depending on the model of BT-headset.  I might propose to go the same way, to buy strongexternal Bluetooth adapter/strong, which will get emanalogue signal/em, convert it to digital over BT, and will have different settings for the volume range. I understand, that this approach is not easy to use and has its drawbacks, so I'd not recommend to go this way, unless you are really annoyed.   hr  Theoretically, you may play a bit with codeEQ/code settings in your iPhone (codeSettings/code - codeMusic/code - codePlayback/code section), this might soften a bit the sound, but it barely affects the minimum volume level, it will just create the different perception, a bit milder sound.  I'm not sure, if there are existing Apps for adjusting EQ + master volume control, I think no-one is using them on iPhone/iPod.  <answer237508> If you set the volume to the lowest, then set the volume limit to the lowest possible, you will find the volume bar will be at maximum again. Just drag it all the way down and the volume will be much lower. HTH!  <comment31904> Did you try the Volume Limit option? <comment31907> It's not what you asked for, but you could use an in-line volume control or attenuator on your headphone cord. <comment31918> @Agos Unfortunately, volume limit only lets you restrict the range of volume, out of the full range. It doesn't let you go any lower :( <comment31919> @KevinReid Good point; I'm afraid this is what I'm going to have to do. <comment41667> As mentioned in the comments above, this isn't a solution. This changes the *maximum* volume, not the minimum. The problem I'm having is that the minimum volume is too loud, not the maximum. <comment41671> Didn't see it in the comments there. Sorry. But while limiting the maximum doesn't technically change the minimum, it does change the minimum volume you can set in practice since the volume difference between two volume settings is smaller. I had the same problem as you and by setting the volume limit extremely low my problem was solved. <comment41673> I've tried moving the volume *slider* all the way to the left and it is still loud. So, the problem is not adjusting the volume, but the lower limit if the volume level itself. <comment72646> The app description says that it doesn't actually change the volume range, just splits it into smaller increments. See above, that won't help me :( <comment76415> WHen you limit the volume, i think it scales the range of the volume slider (for example, the slider all the way right is only 50% of the total possible volume). That way, it should allow more accurate increments.
