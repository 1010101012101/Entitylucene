Change default starting page in iTunes <body> After a long time of unending, annoying suggestions to update iTunes (the version I was using worked fine and didn't need to be "fixed") I finally clicked ok just to get it to stop annoying me. Now every time I open iTunes it goes to the iTunes Store. Pisses me off. I want it to open to "my music" like it used to. Please tell me how to fix this.
