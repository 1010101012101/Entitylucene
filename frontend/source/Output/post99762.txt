What software is this in my menubar? <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZXpUY.png" alt="enter image description here"  Right beside the Alfred icon, there's a small up and down arrow indicating bandwidth upload and download speeds.  I remember downloading and installing something for this, and now I can't remember the name of it. I'm trying to enter the settings for it and also add in the RAM tickers.  Any ideas on what software causes the up/down icons next to the black hat icon?  <answer99765> That program is MenuMeters, available at http://www.ragingmenace.com/  <comment117376> I'll be. It looks just like iStat Menus. I need a new prescription. :-) <comment117377> Just FYI on Mac it's called the Menu Bar :)
