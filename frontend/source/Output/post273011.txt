Emoji and symbols input panel weird behavior <body> I am talking about the text input panel codeEmoji and symbols/code that could be opened thorough kbdctrl/kbd+kbd⌘/kbd+kbdSpace/kbd.  It could be opened as a embubble/em:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/j3pto.png" alt="enter image description here"  or as a emwindow/em:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/X1SiR.png" alt="enter image description here"  The problem is only in the embubble/em mode: when I try to select an emoji (or special char), the embubble body/em automatically slides at the top while clicking and so this will emforce/em me select another unwanted emoji.  This happens only at the first click.  I encountered the same problem with Sierra and on two different Macs.  See this video for further details.  strongPlease note that:/strong  • in this video I clicked for three emojis. First and third attempts demonstrate the bug (dog and snow man), the second (cat) doesn't instead,  • this happens in every Apps such as Telegram, TextEdit, Safari, ... .  Probably it's a bug. There's some workaround?  <comment343197> Does this happen in all apps including TextEdit, Notes, Mail,  Safari? <comment343207> Yes, it happens everywhere. Now add this info in the question. Thanks. <comment345065> Only use the windowed version :) Are you using a trackpad or a mouse? <comment345237> Both mouse or trackpad, indifferently.
