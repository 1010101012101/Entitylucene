Is there a keyboard shortcut to immediately focus the search bar in applications (not Spotlight) in Mountain Lion? <body> If keyboard shortcuts are enabled in gmail, pressing kbd//kbd will focus the search bar from anywhere, so that I can simply type code/stuff/code to search for "stuff" no matter what is currently focused.  Is there a similar keyboard shortcut to focus the search bar within applications (not spotlight)?  hr  emNote:/em I'm looking for an alternative to hitting kbdtab/kbd repeatedly.  <answer70907> I don't believe there is a system-wide shortcut for this, as the definition of Search Bar may not be standard across apps. But hitting kbdâŒ˜/kbd+kbdF/kbd focuses the Search Bar in many Mac applications.  <answer70957> As already noted, most applications use kbdCmd/kbd+kbdF/kbd for search. However, in some applications kbdAlt/kbd +kbdCmd/kbd+kbdF/kbd triggers the main search dialog (e.g., iTunes) or a secondary form of search (e.g., Excel, Finder, Safari, Chrome).  <comment82343> Ahhh. Makes perfect sense. Thanks!
