Keeping the menu dropdown open after clicking? <body> Suppose I wanted to open a couple of bookmarks in my browser. To do this, I use the menu bar. I click on «Bookmarks» to reveal the dropdown with all my bookmarks and then select the bookmark. The dropdown closes and the browser opens the bookmark. Now I have to click on «Bookmarks» again and click on another bookmark, the dropdown again closes and the browser opens the bookmark. Is there a way to keep the menu dropdown opened after I clicked on an item? That way I could click multiple items in the dropdown way faster! I remember being able to do this in Windows XP some years ago and it was really handy. I think I had to hold down ALT when clicking on the menu item.  Thanks for any advice!  strongEdit for clarification/strong: I'm only using the bookmark menu as an easy to understand example. I'm looking for a way to do this system-wide!  <answer30916> May depend on the browser but at least in Safari, Firefox and Chrome, kbdCmd/kbd-clicking on a bookmark folder opens a new tab for every bookmark in the folder. May require some bookmark reorganization though.  <answer36344> What I would do is go to the Bookmarks Menu (Bookmarks -- Show all Bookmarks) and then select Bookmarks Menu from the collections tree to drag and drop links on a new tab  <answer39993> subI am aware that this is not a direct answer, but it might help with the problem anyway. This could be an XY problem./sub  If you find yourself using the same menu items repeatedly, use their keyboard shortcuts. If they don't have shortcuts by default, assign your own in emSystem Preferences » Keyboard » Keyboard Shortcuts » Applications/em.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VRT5q.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer43711> control F2 key gets menu bar focus in full screen app mode set F Keys to standard function keys via keyboard prefs keyboard shortcuts "Focus to Menu Bar"  default is Control F2 for menu bar focus control F2 for dock focus  <comment35504> Thanks, but I was just using the bookmark example as an easy example. I am more interested in doing this in other applications and the finder. Ideally, there should be a way to make this work system-wide! <comment35507> I fear there isn't... <comment35521> I don't know of a way either, unless there's a menu haxie out there somewhere that still works these days. (First desktop I remember that let you do this was the Commodore Amiga...)
