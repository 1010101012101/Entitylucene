(Batch) moving iTunes songs to ~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Music/Artist/SongName <body> I have three albums by emJack Singer/em. They are in ~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Music/strongJack Singer/SongName/strong.  I also have one album by emJack Singer and his band/em. Those files are in ~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Music/strongJack Singer and his band/SongName/strong  I choose to ignore the distinction and rename the artist of the latter to become just emJack Singer/em. iTunes does not move the files. They remain where they are. Presumably this is done to avoid unnecessary Time Machine changes. But I would like to move the files to their canonical location before launching my first Time Machine backup after adding the new album.  How do I tell iTunes to move the files to ~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Music/strongJack Singer/SongName/strong, mirroring the name of the artist in the tag?  <answer56610> From the comments: Under Preferences - Advanced, "Keep iTunes media folder organized" must be checked  <comment64977> My iTunes 10.6.3 moves the files instantly, so I don't think there are Time Machine considerations here. In the Preferences - Advanced, is the iTunes Library path correct? Are the 2 next checkboxes checked? <comment64991> This is indeed the answer. Please add it as such. (Under Preferences \ Advanced, "Keep iTunes media folder organized" must be checked).
