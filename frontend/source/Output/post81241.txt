Can I use a mSATA drive to create a Fusion Drive in my iMac? <body> I have a Samsung MZ MPA1280/0D1 128 SSD mSATA drive.   Can I use this to create a Fusion Drive in my 2011 iMac 27" and, if so, what cable will I need in order to connect the mSATA drive properly?  <answer81247> It should be possible to mount the SSD and your regular HD into a single volume and imitate a fusion drive.
