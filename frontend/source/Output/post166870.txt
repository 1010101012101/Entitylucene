Processor affinity on mac. <body> In Linux machines, there is a command called codetaskset/code, which can be used to do the processor affinity.   In mac(from mavericks) are there any commands to the same job like codetaskset/code?  Else how one can achieve processor affinity on mac?  Thanks in advance.  <answer166871> Apple provides a Thread Affinity API, but nothing like taskset.     OS X does not export interfaces that identify processors or control thread placementâ€”explicit thread to processor binding is not supported. Instead, the kernel manages all thread placement.  Applications expect that the scheduler will, under most circumstances, run its threads using a good processor placement with respect to cache affinity.   <comment195652> Thanks. Any examples of how to use them?
