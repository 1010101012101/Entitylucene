iMac 27" Late 2015 - what ram to buy? <body> I'm waiting for my iMac 27" late 2015 4.0ghz i7 to arrive and I'm looking to buy a 32gb kit to upgrade. I've been browsing for an hour and I can't find any specific buyer guides or websites that sell Mac compatible memory (in the EU).  According to Apple's RAM specs, I managed to find this:  PCPartPicker.com  This is what the Apple specs say:  ul liPC3-14900/li liUnbuffered/li liNonparity/li li204-pin/li li1867MHz DDR3 SDRAM/li /ul  Source: Install memory in an iMac  <answer246109> strongYou will need two "16GB Kits"/strong to get the full 32GB.  I have personally done this in my iMac 27"  The memory that I recommend is Crucial 16GB Kit (8GBx2) DDR3L - CT2K8G3S186DM  I recommend Crucial because they are very reliable and they have a lifetime warranty.  There are brands that are cheaper, but (IMO) it's simply not worth the cost savings of giving up a lifetime warranty.    <answer246112> I usually buy any branded memory with the same pins and MHz and it always work. But there are brand names that manufacture for Apple products, like OWC. But Corsair and Crucial etc have memory sets as well, specifically designed for Mac:   Adamanta | ArchMemory | Crucial | Corsair  <comment303370> Did you do that on a mid or late 2015 model? <comment303371> Mine was a 2012.  But the upgrade is exactly the same.  The PN# I provided is specific to the 2015 as it matches the specs you outlined in your question. <comment303372> Looks like exactly what I was looking for.
