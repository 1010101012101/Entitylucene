What Can I Connect To ExpressPort Slot? <body> I have a mid-2010 MacBook Pro.  It has an ExpressPort Slot connection that seems to have no uses without something else to connect in there.  What are the possible things that I could use this port for?  <answer162505> SATA | Firewire | USB3 ports (usually for external HDDs;) Ethernet ports; Media Card readers; Thunderbolt ports; PCI bus extenders. Sonnettech has quite a few options.
