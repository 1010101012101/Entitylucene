Can I detect Facetime screen shots? <body> Can I somehow know if the other caller is taking a photo (screenshot) while we are on FaceTime? I need to know if they are secretly taking photos of me.  <answer226100> No, there's no way to tell...unless, of course, they have their volume cranked and you can hear the camera shutter sound.  <answer248564> Yes, if you hold the volume down button and home button at same time and hold during FaceTime it will tell you if someone if taking a screenshot of you.  edit: sorry, this is wrong. -owlswipe  <answer267966> You can detect if somebody screenshots you during Facetime.   <comment274498> As far as i know, you will never be sure that someone isn't secretly taking photos of you!!! <comment336306> *How* can you?â€‹ <comment336307> This is...literally the best answer I've ever seen. <comment336308> This is like, literally blatantly false. Huh?
