Can't sign in with MS Lync <body> Since I updated OS X to 10.8.5 a week ago, I have issues signing in with Microsoft Lync: the program crashes every time. I never had issues before so I thought the latest OS update caused the issue, however all my colleagues can use Lync as before.  I installed all Microsoft updates as well ...  Lync returns the following error details  Microsoft Error Reporting log version: 2.0  Error Signature:br Exception: EXC_BAD_ACCESSbr Date/Time: 2013-10-22 09:06:43 +0000br Application Name: Microsoft Lyncbr Application Bundle ID: com.microsoft.Lyncbr Application Signature: UCCPbr Application Version: 14.0.0.110823br Crashed Module Name: libsystem_c.dylibbr Crashed Module Version: unknownbr Crashed Module Offset: 0x000026c0br Blame Module Name: Microsoft Lyncbr Blame Module Version: 14.0.0.110823br Blame Module Offset: 0x01f098f7br Application LCID: 1031br Extra app info: Reg=English Loc=0x0407br Crashed thread: 0br  Any ideas? thx!  <answer106221> Solved this today.
