How can I mount an SMB share from the command line? <body> I would like to mount an SMB network share from the command line (terminal); how would I go about that?  I am using Mac OS X 10.6.4.  <answer698> You should take a look at mount’s help:   precodeman mount /code/pre  Upon closer inspection you’ll see that the filesystem’s type is:  precodemount -t smbfs //username:password@MACHINENAME/SHARENAME /SomeLocalFolderOfChoice /code/pre  Password (and theoretically username) are optional.  The result of the above command will be no output (if all went ok), but a codecd /SomeLocalFolderOfChoice/code, should produce the remote results. Please note that emSomeLocalFolderofChoice/em must exist.  You can also use mount_smbfs to replace the mount -t smbfs.   <answer699> You could easily achieve this using codemount_smbfs/code (which is, actually, a wrapper for codemount -t smbfs/code) :   precodemount_smbfs //user@SERVER/folder ./mntpoint /code/pre  Optionally, add the workgroup :  precodemount_smbfs -W workgroup //user@SERVER/folder ./mntpoint /code/pre  You could, of course, change the code./mntpoint/code (for something like code/Volumes/smb/code).  After doing this, simply go to code./mntpoint/code to browse your data.  To unmount, using the following command :   precodeumount ./mntpoint /code/pre  <answer171822> Use the codeopen(1)/code command and a URL:  precodeopen 'smb://username:password@server/share' /code/pre  Pros: Creates the mount point in code/Volumes/code for you.  Cons: Requires the Finder to be running.  <answer247885> What worked for me to make them mount during boot:  precode==&gt; /etc/auto_master &lt;== # # Automounter master map # +auto_master        # Use directory service /net            -hosts      -nobrowse,hidefromfinder,nosuid /home           auto_home   -nobrowse,hidefromfinder /Network/Servers    -fstab /-          -static /-          auto_smb          # add this line &lt;**********  ==&gt; /etc/auto_smb &lt;==         # Create this if it doesn't exist &lt;**** /(not Volumes)/Public   -fstype=smbfs,soft smb://(user):(password)@192.168.140.5/data/Public /(not Volumes)/ WGroleau -fstype=smbfs,soft smb://(user):(password)@192.168.140.5/data/Students/wes_groleau /code/pre  For some reason, neither the short name nor the FQDN of the server worked, so I used 'ping (name) to get the IP.  In other words, DNS would resolve the name, but mount_smbfs could not.  And I could not put the mount point in /Volumes, because boot up would delete it.  One quirk:  After this worked fine for a few days, for two or three days, LibreOffice, Adobe Reader, and Finder could not find ONE of the two shares, but the shell and TextEdit had no problem.  After two or three days of that, it mysteriously started working again.  If you do these edits and don't want to reboot, you can mount them with 'auto mount -vc'  Update: More quirks.  (1) There are two WiFi systems here, and one of them has no access to the Windows servers.  A couple of times a week, one or both of the routers goes down.  If the "good one" goes down and the MacBook automatically connects to the other one, instead of telling me the drive is off-line, the SMB drivers say "Too many users."  (2) A couple of times a week, I get "permission denied" when I try to access my Windows files.  This typically lasts about a half-hour, during which I can go to a windows bar and log in and see files with the same ID and password.  <answer280138> I would add that if you have a username of the form "workgroup\username", you should mount it like this :  precodemount -t smbfs "//WORKGROUP;username:password@MACHINENAME/SHARENAME" /SomeLocalFolderOfChoice /code/pre  Source : adapting an example from here  <comment48143> I get : `mount_smbfs: mount error: path: Input/output error', while it mounts find via Finder-Connect to Server? <comment171030> How do I go about it if my username has a @ char in it? For example when i am using a microsoft account like xyz@microsoft.com ? I tried giving the username in single and double quotes but dint work.. <comment247621> i prefer this version for quick connections in my local network, there all users are known, so this is a simpler command then using mount_smbfs - where i actually had problems concerning non existent paths - whereas if i would need to connect to some new server with special filesystem, or i would need to try another user or wanted different mount point - ok - but how often does this happen... so my thumb goes up for this simpler solution! Well Done! Ok i am a Terminal freak who still has Finder running, but that is like 90% of us, right? <comment258663> I get this error: `mount_smbfs: illegal option -- W` <comment274062> I get this error: `mount_smbfs: could not find mount point /Volumes/Share: No such file or directory` <comment274064> Isn't `Finder` always opened, at least as a process? <comment275477> @Iulian Onofrei: Not unless the user is logged in interactively. I've needed to use the direct `mount` command in `cron` jobs. Using the `open` command, these would fail if the interactive session was gone, e.g., after a power failure. <comment301137> Quote from `man mount` on OS X Yosemite: `Note: You should always use the system mount command and never call mount_smbfs directly.` <comment303591> Also, note that `open` always exits as if it were successful if it passed the command along to Finder, even if the command later failed to connect to the network drive. <comment305865> @Yashvit: Change the '@' to '%40'
