Can I get Music Videos on my iPhone with iTunes Music Library enabled? <body> I made a few music videos and added them to my iTunes library on my Mac, and I would like to transfer them to my iPhone.  I have iTunes Music Library enabled on both devices, so I cannot directly modify my iPhone's music from my Mac, and it appears to not even let me send music videos to my iPhone either.  Is it possible to transfer the music videos without disabling iTunes Music Library?
