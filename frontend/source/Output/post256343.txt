Delete a file locally, but keep it in iCloud <body> I have a file on my desktop that is now synced with iCloud using the new feature of macOS.   I would like to delete it, but keep a copy of it in the iCloud.   I am nervous that if I simply delete it from my Mac, it will also be deleted in iCloud.  Is there a way to keep the iCloud copy, but delete the local copy?  For example, here are two directories on my desktop, one is only in the cloud, the other is both in the cloud and saved locally:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/r3baN.png" alt="enter image description here"  I would like to make the Personal Docs folder become like the Datasets folder  <answer260228> I have done some testing with this in macOS Sierra, but i hit a brick wall. There is the codebrctl/code command line tool. See codeman brctl/code. The option codeevict/code looked promising to me. So i tried it:  precodebrctl evict test2.txt  evicted content of 'test2.txt' /code/pre  Well the problem is... this only works temporarily. At some point iCloud deamon (codebird/code?) decides to re-download the files.  One possibility would be to monitor codebrctl monitor -i/code and/or codesudo brctl log -w/code and re-evict the stuff. I found no other way of stopping the re-download. Of course one could stop the deamon, but that's not really practical.  <answer269295> As Andreas mentioned in his answer, codebrctl evict/code purges the files. But for me, it seems to work permanently. Even purges recursively through folders. Maybe it is because I purged 40GB of data, hard for iCloud to reset in a heartbeat  precode&gt;brctl evict SuperBigNestedFolder evicted content of 'SuperBigNestedFolder/' /code/pre  Nice!  BUT, when iCloud evicts the files it also throws away all metadata. This cripples Spotlight by removing the ability to search for text found inside popular file formats such as word, pdf, pages, keynote, or txt.   <comment319706> Move the file to iCloud drive. Thereâ€™s no selective syncing of `~/Desktop` and `~/Documents` AFAIK
