Zoom in/out keyboard shortcuts for Swedish keyboard? <body> I could not get the keyboard shortcuts for zoom in/out in Aperture 3 on my Swedish Keyboard.  According to the documentation it should be kbdCommand/kbd+kbd=/kbd and kbdCommand/kbd+kbd-/kbd  I have searched the Internet, but it only shows the same as above.  <answer91969> Firstly, I'd check which keyboard shortcuts are documented for zoom in/out in the relevant menu.  My View menu (in Aperture 3.4.4) is as shown below: note the keyboard shortcuts to the right of the menu option.

On my UK keyboard, '=' has a key to itself (pressing kbdshift/kbd-kbd=/kbd produces '-'), so I'd guess that the issue is to do with the kbdshift/kbd key.  So, secondly, a different approach -- if we can't work out how to generate this key combination on a Swedish keyboard, I'd suggest changing the keyboard shortcut.  To do this, go to Apple menu  System Preferences  Keyboard  Keyboard Shortcuts.  Select Application Shortcuts on the left.  Press the '+' button, then select emAperture/em as the application, type emZoom In/em for Menu Title (making sure you get the spellling and capitalisation exactly right), and then type the key combination you'd like to use in the Keyboard Shortcut box.  img src="https://cl.ly/image/3e3y3L0q0p2O/Screen%20Shot%202013-05-22%20at%2019.58.13.png" alt=""  Finally, if you are eligible for software support, I'd suggest calling AppleCare and asking them for help...  <comment108039> Mine does show the same, but the keyboard shortcuts as shown does not work. My guess is because I have a Swedish keyboard where the '=' & '-' are not on the same place as on English keyboards. <comment108090> @JohanKarlsson OK... confusing stuff! I've edited my answer to include a few more suggestions... see what you think.
