App Store showing update to app I have not installed with an Apple ID that is not mine <body> The App Store wants me to update the Twitter app using a different Apple ID that I don't recognize.  I've never installed Twitter.  When I enter my own Apple ID to either update or install that app, I get a window saying "Unknown Error".  Clicking Ok, shows "There was an error in the App Store. Please try again later. (4)"  Is there anything I can do to get rid of this?  Thanks.  <comment131430> same issue here. Try the steps for reinstalling and uninstalling apps people don't have.
