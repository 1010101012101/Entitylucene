Can't update cabal in Mac OS X 10.6 <body> I am trying to install cabal (for Haskell) in Mac OS X 10.6.5 (64-bit kernel). When I try the command "cabal update" I am presented with the following error:  precodecabal: Codec.Compression.Zlib: premature end of compressed stream /code/pre  Does anyone have experience with this and knows how to fix it? Thanks.  <answer4787> Apparently:     This bug disappears if you compile cabal-install with GHC 6.12.1. (here and here)
