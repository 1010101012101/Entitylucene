How do you access network preferences from the Terminal? <body> I can't seem to find how to open the network preferences from the Terminal. What Terminal command will open up the Network preferences window as if having gone by System Preferences  Network ?  <answer65797> Typing  precodeopen /System/Library/PreferencePanes/Network.prefPane/ /code/pre  works for me on Lion. You can substitute codeNetwork.prefPane/code for any of the preference panes in the codePreferencePanes/code folder. This also switches to the correct pane even if System Preferences is already open.
