No Macintosh HD in Volumes folder <body> I am running in recovery mode to save the data from disk( I cant login due to deletion of private/var folder). I opened codeTerminal/code and went to codeVolumes/code. This folder should be populated with the codeMacintosh HD/code subfolder. It isn't. It just lists the codeOS X Base System, the external hard drive I have connected and .Trashes/code. I ran First Aid on Macintosh HD Parent folder called APPLE SSD... in Disk Utility panel. Nothing changed. How can I copy the data if there is no Macintosh HD to navigate to?  This is the output from codediskutil list/code  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yRGK1.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer236221> Your main volume is encrypted with FileVault and still locked – consequently it doesn't show up in /Volumes. Before being able to mount it you'd have to unlock it:  precodediskutil cs unlockVolume lvUUID #replace lvUUID by the one shown in the diskutil listing /code/pre  You will then be asked to enter the passphrase/password. You have to enter a passphrase or a password of a regular user eligible of unlocking FileVault. In your example the lvUUID is shown in codediskutil list/code and starts with 573…. You may also get the lvUUID by entering codediskutil cs list/code.  <comment289033> Can you please open Terminal, run `diskutil list` and add a picture of the output to the question? <comment289052> I added a screenshot <comment289056> Thank you! Just to be sure, I replace the lvUUID with the 573.. and than get a prompt for typing in password? or just type password after 573... <comment289057> @sanjihan You will get a pw prompt <comment289060> I am successfully copying files with cp -r command. Thank you! Is there a way to know when files had finished copying? (except for listening for hard drive spinning sound to stop) <comment289062> @sanjihan You will get a new prompt if no error occurs! Better use `rsync ...`! rsync allows to add an option to show the progress.
