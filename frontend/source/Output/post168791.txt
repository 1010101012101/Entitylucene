What are the valid users that need to exist on Mac OS X <body> For example with CleanMyMac username option I can see users like "Kerberos FAST Account", com.apple.calendarserver and large number of others all with system privileges  with id 260 or below except for Message Bus which is 500 MacPorts also has a user with id 503. Anything below 500 has a "system" in name. All "real" users that I have created are above 500.   so what would be the list for valid users that I should see in the space below 500 in a standard Yosemite installation with OS X Server on it...  <answer168793> There are 87 valid users. 83 from OS X 10.10.1 (Build 14B25) and 4 from Server 4.0.3 (Build 14S350).  You can see them from terminal with the command:  precodedscl . -list /Users /code/pre  The list is as follows:  precode_amavisd _appleevents _appowner _appserver _ard _assetcache _astris _atsserver _avbdeviced _calendar _ces _clamav _coreaudiod _coremediaiod _cvmsroot _cvs _cyrus _devdocs _devicemgr _displaypolicyd _distnote _dovecot _dovenull _dpaudio _eppc _ftp _geod _iconservices _installassistant _installer _jabber _kadmin_admin _kadmin_changepw _krb_anonymous _krb_changepw _krb_kadmin _krb_kerberos _krb_krbtgt _krbfast _krbtgt _launchservicesd _lda _locationd _lp _mailman _mcxalr _mdnsresponder _mysql _netbios _netstatistics _networkd _nsurlsessiond _nsurlstoraged _postfix _postgres _qtss _sandbox _screensaver _scsd _securityagent _serialnumberd _softwareupdate _spotlight _sshd _svn _taskgated _teamsserver _timezone _tokend _trustevaluationagent _unknown _update_sharing _usbmuxd _uucp _warmd _webauthserver _windowserver _www _xcsbuildagent _xcsbuildd _xcscouch _xcscredserver _xcsd com.apple.calendarserver daemon nobody root /code/pre  For completeness, my OS X (non-server app) Mac has 84 users.  It has an additional Guest user (FileVault 2 added that one) and is lacking these server apps.  precode_xcsbuildd _xcscouch _xcsd com.apple.calendarserver /code/pre
