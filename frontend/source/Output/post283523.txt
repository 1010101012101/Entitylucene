How to open PDF files stored in iBooks on iPad in Adobe Reader <body> I have downloaded PDF files and saved them in iBooks on my iPad. I want to open some PDF files in Adobe Reader but there is no option to do so.   I looked up on internet and it asks for a PC (which I don't have). Is there any way to do so?  I am using iPad Air 2.  <answer283527> Unfortunately iBooks on iOS doesn't have the ability to show a share sheet for a document, and therefore can't share to Adobe Reader directly. A workaround is to tap Share â†’ Email, email the PDF to yourself, then use Mail to open the attachment with Adobe Reader.
