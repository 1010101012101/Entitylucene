I have the music logo stuck when I click music, <body> I have turned it on and off, hit the music app and it's still frozen.  What other options do I have to fix this issue?  <answer225766> I perform a restore with iTunes from a previous backup and I was able to get past the screen. After the restore I hit the music App and now I am able to use it .  <comment274098> Is this on iOS or OS X? Make sure you specify, even if you're answering your own question.
