Hide/Fix Macbook Pro Retina Screen Scratch <body> I noticed that I have a small scratch on my Macbook Pro Retina's screen.  When this has happened on my desktop LCDs I've used some Vaseline to hide it.  While I know that doesn't actually fix it I am looking for a technique to make this scratch less noticeable.  <answer153228> Possible methods depending on the scratch depth.  1- Fill it - for deep scratches.  Fill it with toothpaste! or professional glass filler.     Believe it or not, toothpaste can be used to patch some screen   scratches. Actual toothpaste, not gel or paste-mouthwash hybrids, must   be used. Users should gently massage the paste into the scratch with   their fingers using a circular motion. If done properly, the paste   should adhere to the scratch and polish it away. Then, use a soft   cloth to remove excess paste from the screen. Finally, use glass   cleaner or a special screen cleaner to remove any additional residue.      Petroleum jelly can also be applied in a similar manner, although it   may need to be reapplied if a user happens to rub his or her screen   and removes it from the scratch. While toothpaste is an abrasive that   pares down a scratch, petroleum jelly fills the scratch because it   closely matches the optical density of the LCD display.   2- Polish- for shallow scratches  Get the glass polish in any computer or similar store.  Pro..works well on shallow scratches  Con.. you will create a larger portion on your screen with lower transparency due to polishing.
