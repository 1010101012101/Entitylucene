How to install Gnuplot on mac 10.5.8? <body> I use Mac OS 10.5.8 and I want to install Gnuplot. I have found some advice on the net but it is not useful for me. Can anyone give me some clear steps of what is needed? What programs do I need and where can I find them exactly? A step-by-step solution invoking terminal commands would be appreciated.  <answer107993> http://brew.sh/  Install brew. The website lists the requirements, and the step by steps command line instructions. In short, it's:  precoderuby -e "$(curl -fsSL --insecure https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go)" /code/pre  Then:  precodebrew install gnuplot /code/pre  You're on 10.5.8 so installation requires '--insecure' as the older version of curl didn't have the CA secure certs packaged in.  Brew is also very handy for installing software in general. It's a unix package manager in the style of apt.  <comment126653> Did this answer on TeX.sx not help?
