Why does my iPhone not have any audio during phone calls? <body> My iPhone 5 is having a strange problem that affects phone calls only.  (And yes, I've tried rebooting.)  h2Regular Phone Call/h2  When I call someone, or someone calls me (whether via iPhone or non-iPhone), the call seems to connect, but there is strongno audio/strong for either participant.  They can't hear me, and I can't hear them.  The result is the same whether using speakerphone or not.  h2Microphone &amp; Speaker OK?/h2  The microphone works fine -- I can make Facetime calls (either audio or video), I can have it convert my speech into text, etc.  The speaker you hold up to your ear works fine -- I can hear just fine on Facetime calls.  The speaker you use to broadcast sound to everyone nearby works fine, too -- I can play music and watch videos.  h2Network Behavior OK?/h2  The phone's ability to connect to the cellular network seems normal, too.  I can make and receive Facetime calls via the cellular network, connect to the internet, and send/receive texts (for both iPhones and non-iPhones).  hr  What can I do to fix this problem?  (Or at least diagnose it further...)  (After months of trying things, I was unable to fix the phone and simply bought a new one.)  <answer223934> Go into settings on your iPhone then General - Accessibility, scroll down Call Audio Routing and finally tick strongAutomatic/strong. This should solve your problem.  <answer283178> The issue may be caused by bluetooth devices, especially if you have a vehicle that you use to bluetooth to your phone. During your next phone call, press the Bluetooth button and select iPhone.  <comment271533> It's already set on automatic. <comment357005> Hopefully your answer helps someone else.  In my case, I didn't own any bluetooth devices.
