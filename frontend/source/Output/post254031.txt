Upgrade Operating System Snow Leopard to OS Sierra <body> I know I must upgrade first to El Capitan before upgrading to OS Sierra. But my question is will I loose installed Adobe Photoshop CS5 and my Bootcamp where I have 2 other costly programmmes installed.  <answer254046> Doubtful that you'll lose either Photoshop on the Mac partition or the Bootcamp partition itself while upgrading. Of course, backing up before moving forward is always the way to go.  :)  <comment316225> Can you reinstall them after the upgrade? <comment316257> Can't you go directly from SL to Sierra? <comment316258> @fbara does CS5 run under Sierra? Bootcamp should be OK <comment316279> I have no idea but I'm sure Adobe knows and it's probably on their site.
