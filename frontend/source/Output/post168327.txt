Create a line separation for finder in the dock? (osx 10.10) <body> I was wondering if it would be possible to create a line separator for the finder app, just like the one found next to the trash can?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Nh4U6.png" alt="enter image description here"  The only behaviour difference that I'd like is for the line to display to the right of the finder app, not left.  I've done a lot of googling with no luck, I can only find a command to create transparent seperations:  Using:   precodedefaults write com.apple.dock persistent-apps -array-add '{ "tile-type" = "spacer-tile"; }' killall Dock /code/pre  Is anyone aware of how to do this?  <answer168330> The dock doesn't support additional horizontal spacers per se (besides those invisible ones), but there used to be a hacky work-around where you made a code.app/code file with a line as an icon, and could use that as a spacer.    Basically, create a folder, append .app to it, and give it a separator icon by changing the icon. Then drag and drop the separator to the dock. You can find lots of assets for docks online at sites like deviantart or the old macthemes.net (if that still exists...)  Still, the easiest way is to probably just use the codedefaults write/code command to get those invisble spacers. I use them and find it works very nicely:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ssy7j.png" alt="MyDock"  <comment197556> I suppose this cannot be done, because this spacer separates `persistent-apps` from `persistent-others` (can be found in `com.apple.dock` plist).
