How Can I Copy a Video to iPhone and Send It Over iMessage? <body> I'm trying to send to video I made with my previous Windows Phone over iMessage, but after syncing it to my phone with iTunes, it shows up as a movie.  I can't select it from the messaging app, because I can only select items from codePictures &gt; Video/code.  How can I get it to show up in there?

After opening the attachment from the email app, it began to play, but I noticed it had the sharing icon so I was able to send it over iMessage from there.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/x1EoA.png" alt="iOs hare icon"  However, I would still like a general solution for larger files.  <answer110313> I think you'll need to import it into iPhoto in order to sync it to your iPhone's picture folder and be able to share via iMessage. The steps would be:  ol liImport into iPhoto, for example by dragging the video to it's icon in the dock/li liSync the Video to your iPhone with iTunes by selecting the event which was automatically created in/by iPhoto. If there isn't an event created automatically, you'd need to create one or  put that video in an album. Any "folder" in iPhoto which is able to be synced by iTunes should do the job./li liNow it should appear in your pictures app on the iPhone and you should be able to share it via iMessage/li /ol  Hope that helps  <comment129902> What format is the video in? <comment129908> @patrix I've updated the question with technical details.
