How to remove top and bottom lines from a file using sed, awk, etc. in 1 step <body> I want to chop the top 13 and the last 6 lines from a file  There are several answers on unix/linux but they aren't working for me as the sed options used aren't available on osx, tac isn't available, etc.br Si I am posting here for a q&amp;a that is specific to osx  Right now I am using  precode$ cat myfile | tail -n+14 | sed '$d' | sed '$d' | sed '$d' | sed '$d' | sed '$d' | sed '$d' /code/pre  but am looking for a shorter '1 step at the end' way.  <answer200853> Here's my try, not so elegant but works:  precodecat myFile | tail -n+14 | head -n $[ $(wc -l myFile | awk '{ print $1 }') - 19 ] /code/pre  Note: last code19/code is code13/code + code6/code  It's better to embed this into a script:  precode#!/bin/bash                                                                                                                                                                                                          FILE="$1" HEAD_STRIP="$2" TAIL_STRIP="$3"  cat $FILE | tail -n+$[$HEAD_STRIP + 1] | head -n $[ $(wc -l $FILE | awk '{ print $1 }') - $[HEAD_STRIP + TAIL_STRIP] ] /code/pre  <answer200855> You can do it all with codetail/code  precodetail -n+14 FILE | tail -r | tail -n+7 | tail -r /code/pre  ul liThe first codetail/code removes the top 13 lines/li liThe second codetail/code reverses the line order/li liThe third codetail/code removes the top 6 lines of the reversed order/li liThe last codetail/code reverses the line order again/li /ul  or with awk (with inspiration from patrix)  precodeawk -v n="$(wc -l FILE)" 'NR &gt; 13 &amp;&amp; NR &lt; (n-6+1)' FILE /code/pre  <answer200857> Try this way:  precodesed '1,13d' filename | head -n -6 /code/pre  The codesed/code command can be used to delete a range of lines. Here 1 and 13 are min and max line numbers.  <answer208037> This will work with OSX's version of codetail/code:  precodecat file.txt | tail -n +7 | tail -r | tail -n +14 | tail -r     /code/pre  If you have gnu version of codehead/code (installed by: codebrew install coreutils/code) you can do:  precodecat file.txt | tail -n +7 | head -n -13 /code/pre  <answer208058> Just for the fun of it:  precodesed -e '1,13d' -e $(($(wc -l &lt;FILE)-6+1)),\$d FILE /code/pre  Still needs two full passes over the input file though.  <comment250950> Besides the uuoc in both commands, you have the requirements backwards.
