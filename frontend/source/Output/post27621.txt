How can I remove iOS 4.2 from an iPad? <body> I need to remove iOS 4.2 beta from an iPad which I added using iTunes and the option+click Restore button feature.   When I click "Restore" in iTunes I get an error (image attached). I have the iOS SDK &amp; XCode installed.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZHr9c.png" alt="alt text"  <answer27622> strongStep 1:/strong You need to put the iPad into recovery mode.  emPress and hold the home and sleep/wake buttons until the device shuts off.
