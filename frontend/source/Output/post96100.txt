mac server lost network users <body> We are using a mac mini with os x server installed on it. Since 3 days we can't login no more to access the files on it (via Finder  shared). We can share the screen of our server and when we open the server.app it seems like we have lost our network users. This is rather strange since we haven't changed anything. But our 3 network users are gone and we can't add no more users in general. We tried restarting a couple of time, restarting services and we looked at our ip/dns settings but we haven't change anything on our ip/dns so that should still work as before, but it doesn't.  Does someone has a clue on how we lost our network users en why we can't add users?  Our server info: System version: OS X 10.8.4 Server version: Server 2.2.1  <comment112825> Welcome to th site. We have a guide on [ask] that might hemp you edit part of the question. Where it states "we tried everything but nothing is working" could use one specific thing you tried and how exactly it didn't work. <comment112828> Oke, I will try to explain that part better.
