How to make a HTML file as your wall paper <body> Is there any way to use a Web arrive file or a HTML file as your wall paper? I found this interactive website (http://mrdoob.github.io/three.js/examples/css3d_periodictable.html) and want to put it as my wall paper.   <comment169925> Your intention probably is to keep the interactivity even when using the page as a desktop background, right? <comment169926> Yup. That's about it <comment170522> You can replace Finder with Safari. You can not have an interactive background by default. Cause your finder is already broken, try this: (http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/19589/is-there-a-way-to-replace-finder-altogether)
