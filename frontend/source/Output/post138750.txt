How to mirror one folder to another using rsync 3.x? <body> I have compiled rsync 3.0.9 just because the one included in Mavericks is so old.  Anyway, I am trying to mirror a folder in my main HDD in another HDD. I don't think it matters but both are connected via SATA and both are formatted as HFS (case-insentive and journaled).  I ran:  precodersync -ahv --delete --exclude="my-exclude-file.txt" --iconv=utf-8-mac,utf-8 --progress /sources/ /destination/ /code/pre  and it doesn't skip the m4a/mp3 files it has processed already!  Any ideas what I could be doing wrong? Thanks a lot :)  <answer138769> If you add the itemised "-i" or "--itemize-changes" option to your command rsync will tell you why it is transferring the files.  For each file you'll see a strings that looks like "f..t......". The format of the string is "YXcstpoguax". Y is the direction of the transfer. X is the type of object being transferred (for example 'f'ile, 'd'irectory). The rest of the string documents the changes.  ul lic for checksum/li lis for size/li lit for modification time/li lip for permissions/li lio for owner/li lig for group/li liu is currently reserved for future use/li lia for ACL permissions/li lix for extended attributes/li /ul  So in my example above it transferred the file because the modification time was different.  This should help you identify why the files are still being transferred.  <comment163721> thank you so much. that led me to the reason why it keeps on copying over and over again! :) ps. I did use -i but I can never understood what it meant.
