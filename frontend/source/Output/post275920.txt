I would like to use iMac as a display, but without loading an OS <body> I have a late 2009 27" iMac, but recently the internal hard drive completely died. When I try to power it up, the iMac gets stuck on the white Apple loading screen. So instead I would now like to use it just as a display.   Is there a way to do this without replacing the internal hard drive? I have used it as a display before when it was working, so I know it can be used that way.  <answer275928> If your main priority is just not to replace the HDD, why not install macOS onto a USB flash drive and use that purely so you can use the iMac in Target Display Mode?  To do this, follow these steps:  ol liBoot your iMac from the USB flash drive /li liEnsure the other Mac is also booted up and logged into a user account /li liConnect the two Macs with a Mini DisplayPort or Thunderbolt cable /li liPress kbdCommand/kbdkbd F2 /kbdon the keyboard of the iMac (i.e. The one you want to use as a display)./li /ol  For more information you should read Use your iMac as a display with Target Display Mode  <comment347312> Yes I was thinking of doing this, but I posted this just incase that there was another solution. Could you tell me more about booting off a USB? I know how to install an OS off a USB but not about using the USB as a replacement for the HDD. <comment347315> Take a look at [How to set up and use an external Mac startup disk](https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT202796). Keep in mind that any macOS version from Snow Leopard 10.6.1 supports Target Display Mode, although depending on your exact model of 27" 2009 iMac, it _may_ not support booting from an OS earlier than Snow Leopard 10.6.3.
