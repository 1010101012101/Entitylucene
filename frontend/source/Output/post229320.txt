How to enable "Preview" in open/save dialogs (viewed as List)? <body> I hate open/save dialogs.  They suck.  Specifically, I want the same functionality as...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3ezCE.png" alt="finder"  here..  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HNAoT.png" alt="open save"  I don't want to use "Browser View", I don't want to use Quicklook.  I strongdon't mind/strong a nasty hack.  Any takers?  <answer229321> How about DefaultFolderX?br More features than I know what to write about, without it sounding like an advert ;-)br I've used it so long I actually find it difficult to work on machines that don't have it installed.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/M4UbU.png" alt="enter image description here"
