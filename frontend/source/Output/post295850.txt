"No Bag Entry" when trying to reinstall Sierra <body> Was given a MacBook Air (2013) secondhand, with one stipulation being that I delete the previous owner's info and items off of the Macbook before I started using it. Did that to Apple's specifications on their website, but whenever it boots into Recovery Mode and I click on reinstall Sierra, I get a "no bag entry" error after clicking go on the MacOS Sierra screen.  I'm at my wits end, and this is basically my last option before I call it quits. Can anyone guide me?  <answer295875> My suggestion is to create a bootable flash drive with the macOS Sierra installer on it.   ul liBoot from the flash drive. /li liErase the internal harddisk. /li liReinstall macOS Sierra./li /ul  &nbsp;  h2Preparation:/h2  ul liDownload macOS Sierra Installer from the Mac App Store.
