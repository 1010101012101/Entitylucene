Attempting to setup Exchange account in System Preferences causes crash <body> I have two computers both installed with OSX 10.9.2 and on one computer I did this with no problem what so ever but on the other computer, when I attempt to setup my Exchange account in the System PreferencesInternet Accounts menu, it throws this error:  There was an error in Internet Accounts preference pane.  Having looked for a solution on Apple Discussion Forums, I have attempted to delete these files:  /Library/Preferences/com.apple.system preferences .plist  /Library/Preferences/com.apple.screensaver.&lt;12digitHexNumber.plist  /Library/Preferences/com.apple.desktop.plist  /Library/Preferences/By Host/com.apple.systempreferences.xxx.plist of them)  /Library/Caches/com.apple.systempreferences  /Library/Preferences/com.apple.systemuiserver.plist  followed by emptying my recycle-bin and restart the computer, but the problem persists.  h2Screenshots:/h2  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4rdjR.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mvmPm.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  hr  h2Console Excerpt (Link to view complete Console report)/h2  precodeProcess:         com.apple.preferences.internetaccounts.remoteservice [970] Path:            /System/Library/PreferencePanes/InternetAccounts.prefPane/Contents/XPCServices/com.apple.preferences.internetaccounts.remoteservice.xpc/Contents/MacOS/com.apple.preferences.internetaccounts.remoteservice Identifier:      com.apple.preferences.internetaccounts.remoteservice Version:         1.0 (1) Build Info:      InternetAccounts-225004000000000~1 Code Type:       X86-64 (Native) Parent Process:  ???

After looking more closely at the log and mulling over it for a moment I noticed in the log:  precode*** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInvalidArgumentException', reason: '*** setObjectForKey: object cannot be nil (key: serverName)' /code/pre  So I attempted to setup the account in PreferencesInternet Accounts again but this time, I started the process with all of my internet connections disabled.  So I disabled the wifi and ethernet adapters beforehand.  Now, when after entering my info, and selecting continue instead of crashing it displayed a new window requesting that I manually enter the server address.  I manually entered the server, reactivated my network connection, and selected continue, at which point it completed successfully.  The problem must be that when the system attempts to find the server automatically it fails to find it, and rather than request it manually, it crashes.  But if there is no internet connection its forced to request the information since it is unable to search for it.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Yvwt3.jpg" alt="enter image description here"
