How to view saved passwords on Chrome iOS? <body> On my desktop I have an extension which prevents websites from reqesting the browser not to recognize the password fields (I imagine they view this feature as unsecure). Now I have synced my passwords with Chrome in iOS, and the extension is not available on iPad. This means that while the  password has synced, it does not automatically get entered into the password field. So I thought I would just view the saved password and enter it manually. Unfortunately I am unable to do so. If anyone knows how to either view my passwords or otherwise recover it, I would be most grateful.  <answer130935> In Chrome for iOS:    ol liGo to Settings/li liTap Save Passwords/li liThere should be a list of all passwords you saved. You can delete then using the edit button or swiping left on the password you want to delete/li /ol  <answer205540> You can see them also on passwords.google.com.  <answer205558> You can't review your stored Passwords in the Chrome App at all.  On the App and in the Support Documents Apple mentions  to use the url passwords.google.com see img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sX6L4.jpg" alt="Screenshot from Chrome App"  On that Page when you open it on your Moblie it says that you can access your Passwords From all your Divices but not fron this Site see img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/etfqC.jpg" alt="Screenshot from Website"  So i think there is currently no way you can have a Look at your saved Passwords at the Moment.  If you realy need it you should Fill a Bug request and send it to Google so they maybe will fix it in the App.  <answer250818> View and manage passwords at passwords.google.com  From there sign in to your google account and you will be able to look at all the passwords you have saved. Hope this helps.  <comment242992> This does not explain how to view saved passwords. <comment247853> @MistaJ - just click on password field and you should see 'show' button <comment346370> @MarekBettman There is no Show button on Chrome for iPhone. Chrome for Windows has one, but on the iPhone, there is no button.
