iCloud problems with iPhone <body> I recently set up my iCloud account to sync my photos to my computer. I followed the online instructions and went into my phone settings to enable iCloud Photo Stream, where it says it will automatically upload my library to iCloud. However, it has not done anything, not even started to upload.   What shall I do?   <comment243350> Welcome to Ask Different! Please add more information regarding your setup. Do you have a Mac or a PC? Which online instructions did you follow? What is your iOS, OS X, or Windows version? Thanks! <comment243359> I'd log into iCloud.com in a normal computer browser and see if they show there.
