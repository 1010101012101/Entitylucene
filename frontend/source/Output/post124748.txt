How can I import my contacts and data from Basecamp to Proofhub? <body> I've been using Basecamp as a project management tool since 2010.  It has a good interface and organisation of data, but sometimes you might not be willing to share the secrecy of a project with the clients. There is no such feature in Basecamp. That's why I am thinking to switch on Proofhub.   So, anybody please let me know is there any provision in Proofhub to import all the data and contact?   <answer124899> You can perform following steps to import data from basecamp to your proofhub account.
