Sign in without credit card if the Apple id is already created <body> I have create my apple Id online using chrome and not from the App store or Itunes. Now when i try to download any free app from the app store it gives me a error that the Apple id i am using has never been used before. It takes me to a different page where i have to agree to the agreement and demands the credit card info on the next screen where the "none" option is not available.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nWmp1.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dmdJi.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/r3SCR.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/h4FGb.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer161704> Log in Apple Store using your AppleID  Select Account  Select Edit for the Payment type  Select None.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MafXL.jpg" alt="none"  <answer161814> Creation of Apple ID does not mean you've created an App store account, so when creating a App store account one you'll need to setup payment information either using a credit card or a debit card if you're creating an emIndian/em Apple app store account. Payment setup is done to ease the process of buying content/apps later while using the store. The initial setup does not require you to make any payments.  codeNone/code option for payment type is not available for the Indian users. It's been this way for a very long time. Although if you really had no other choice, You could create an apple account with US app store and select codeNone/code as the payment choice.  <comment189011> There is no "none" option. <comment189012> I have it showing! so what do you have ? in Apple Store app. <comment189017> I have added some screenshots(extended the question) <comment189024> OK, skip the Payment but fill out the Billing Address info. No worry they can not charge you anything. <comment189026> I cant skip the payment info ,i need to fill it also <comment189027> That sucks :(, maybe because you are in India ? <comment189034> @Buscarì›ƒ The `none` option only comes for the US store. I have an Indian account for which I had to setup a credit card. <comment189849> Even after changing the location to US there is still no "none" option. Only "Paypal" has been added. <comment189952> @Krill start over. Create a new apple store account. If you try to switch on the existing account, it does not appear usually.
