Music is taking up all my iPhone 5 storage <body> My storage is almost all used up and I cant update software or take pictures.  It looks like Music is taking up aLOT of space.  How can I make sure that if I delete off phone it doesn't delate on iTunes also?  <answer158486> Deleting music off your phone doesnt affect the itunes library's contents (in  your case Music)  So you can emun-sync your music../ update your library../em and put whatever you want back on.
