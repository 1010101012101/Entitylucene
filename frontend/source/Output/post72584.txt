Relative Wifi performance: iPhone 5 and iPad <body> I noticed that my iPhone's Wifi performance sometimes lagged and so I did an experiment. From exactly the same place in my living room, within seconds of each other, my iPad showed around 6Mb down and my iPhone 5 showed less than half that, around 2.5Mb.   Can someone suggest why they think this might be?  <answer72588> Not knowing what iPad you have, it likely has a different CPU and Wireless chipset. It also could have differing RAM and workloads - although they usually are not a blocking or even major factor in download tests.  <answer129930> I'm not sure if it's relative to your problem. But I was experiencing some problems with my iPhone 5 Wifi signal and down performance. I found that some iPhone 5 users were experiencing the same problem, due to a WiFi connection configuration. So what they did was just reset the network configuration on the strongGeneral settings/strong.
