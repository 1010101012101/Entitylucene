C error: ld: library not found for -lgcc Collect2: error . Yosemite <body> I can't compile anything with gcc, the following error always appears:  precodeld: library not found for -lgcc collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status /code/pre  The code I am running is fine, ran it in another computer without any problems. Have also run multiple other codes in other computers just fine but get the same error when try to compile them in mine.   Always use the command   precodegcc -o salida file.c /code/pre  First installed gcc manually, had the error, uninstalled and installed it with homebrew and still have the same error.  I am on Yosemite, if I put "gcc --version" it returns I have the 5.1.0 version, and if I put " brew list --versions gcc" it returns 6.2.0, also have 7.2.1 version of Xcode.
