The only advise I can give you is a generic "use your backup" answer, because I am sure you haven't really just thrown a Beta OS onto your primary machine without taking one, right?  <comment48089> @stuffle thanks. It's my test machine, not really important if mail won't works, but i won't know why... <comment48090> I'd be interested to know how you reverted.  Rollback is an odd term, are you implying you used Time Machine to back out an OS upgrade? <comment48093> @stuffle I rollbacked to **lion** editing   `/System/Library/CoreServices/SystemVersion.plist` file and changing **1.8** to **1.7**. After that i downloaded lion from app store (`ALT+click`) and reinstalled all. I need only to rechange user and root password (`reboot + cmd +r, utilities, terminal-resetpassword`) and all works. <comment48119> Beta or pre-release software, with a few exceptions, is off-topic for Ask Different. <comment48366> I am stuck in the same situation. Using Sparrow Mail lite for now. <comment49117> Restore /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/iLifeMediaBrowser.framework from a Time Machine backup older than when you installed Mountain Lion
