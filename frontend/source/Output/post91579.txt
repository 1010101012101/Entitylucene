MacBook Air screen turns off randomly <body> I had my MacBook Air 13" 2011 for almost 2 years now. And right from the start I kept having this weird issue: sometimes while I'm working on it, the screen (and the monitor attached via displayport aswell) randomly shuts off (or goes to sleep). The computer is still active and everything is still running normally, so If I hit a key it goes back on normally... It happens even if my power cord is plugged in.  It's not a big deal, but it sometimes gets very annoying when it happens while I am typing.br Any clues?br Thanks!  <answer91585> Assuming it only happens sometimes and only when you are actively using the computer (key board &amp; Mouse)  Lets find out if it is you doing it.  Check your settings for Display Sleep in:  System preferences Desktop and Screen saver Hot Corners!  In here look if you have a setting to put display to sleep.  <answer263090> Make sure that your Display's sleep settings are set to "Never" on both battery power and AC power. Also, another setting might be affecting the sleep function. Go to System Preferences, then Security and Privacy, then click the Privacy tab, and then Click the Lock to Make Changes. That will allow you to click on "Advanced" in the lower right corner. This will open a pop-up; be sure to UNCHECK "Log out after ___ minutes."  That's what was constantly putting my MacBook Air to sleep and logging me out of all open applications. Lots of GRRRR moments trying to figure it out, but once located, it took care of the problem.  <comment107953> yes I am running on OSX Lion <comment107954> Haha I think this is it! Can't believe it. Thanks! <comment256880> I have the same issue now with my iMac 27' (mid 2011), suddenly the screen shuts down and I have to press 'Ctrl + Shift + Eject' to supposedly turn off the screen and press any key to wake it up :/
