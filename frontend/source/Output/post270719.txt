My call history came up on my roommates iPad even though we have different Apple IDs <body> My call history is coming up on my roommates iPad, we do not share any accounts, although I do use his iPad on occasion.  <comment340226> At some point you must have signed-in to your roommate's iPad, maybe for Face Time?.  That's the only way your call history will show-up there.  Go [here](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203983), (which shows you how to sign-in to the various apps), and sign-out of everything.
