How to disagree to iTunes privacy policy? <body> I accidentally pressed that I agree to iTunes tos when I opened the app on Mac os Sierra. The fact is I don't agree to the tos. How can I get the dialog option back? I don't plan to use iTunes.  <answer283828> It is likely that the only way to un-ring that bell would be to back up your files and create a new account on your Mac, migrate those files, and delete the old profile. You could then launch iTunes and disagree but I believe all that does is just quit the app, so if you launch it again it will ask, again, if you agree.  And iTunes like most of the apps that come with macOS can't be deleted.  <answer283829> When you open iTunes for the first time and agree to the license agreement, it creates the code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iTunes.plist/code file with a dictionary entry called codelicense-agreements/code. You can just delete the code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iTunes.plist/code file if you have no intension of using iTunes and it will be as if you never agreed to the license agreement.  In Terminal:  precoderm ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iTunes.plist /code/pre  If you just want to delete the codelicense-agreements/code use:  precodedefaults delete com.apple.itunes license-agreements /code/pre  hr  If you want to remove the iTunes app in macOS, you should be able to just move it to the Trash and then empty the Trash. I was able to do that in macOS 10.12.3, however you might have to disable System Integrity Protection and if so, do the following:  ul liShutdown your Mac./li liStart up from macOS Recovery using: kbdCommand/kbd-kbdR/kbd/li liSelect your Language and press kbdEnter/kbd./li liAt macOS Utilities, select Terminal from the Utilities menu./li liIn Terminal type, codecsrutil disable/code then press kbdEnter/kbd./li liIn Terminal type, codereboot/code then press kbdEnter/kbd./li liOnce back in normal mode macOS, in Terminal use the following command:  precodesudo rm -fr /Applications/iTunes.app /code/pre/li liThen press kbdEnter/kbd, type your password, then press kbdEnter/kbd again./li /ul  Don't forget to enable System Integrity Protection afterwards. Repeat the necessary steps, however use codecsrutil enable/code.  <comment357894> If you don't plan to use iTunes, delete it from your machine. <comment357895> I tried deleting it but I got a pop-up telling me that it can't be deleted <comment357905> @Wideem, I updated my answer with directions to delete iTunes.app.
