Play protected WMV files on a Mac? <body> I'm trying to watch a protected WMV file on my Mac, but it seems that neither VLC nor Flip4Mac support DRMs. Well at least all I get is psychedelic images, such as this one:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JSG4Z.png" alt="freaky"   Is there any way to play such videos on Mac OS X emwithout/em resorting to any virtualization software?  <answer23219> As far as I know the DRM aspects are built directly into Windows so won't work on OS X. Best bet would be virtualization I'm afraid!  <comment25912> That's my understanding also. I don't believe there has ever been a native Mac solution for playing DRM'ed WMV files.
