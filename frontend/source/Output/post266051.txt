Photo organiser app <body> What app would you propose to my father (simple HCI) who wants to sort, organise and attribute details to his pictures; which are taken or downloaded.  Main aspects of the app is to organise easily or automatically and to set metadata to the pics so he can remember the details.  I tried the Photo Investigator app but I was disappointed by the way you set the caption image details and messes with your photos.  <answer266073> Check out Pixave 2. It's a photo organizer/viewer that features auto import, extensive tagging, multiple libraries, web capture, and an awesome UI. I switched to it from Photos and I'm very happy with the experience so far.  <comment333641> Thanks this look cool, however, I found it only for MAC, is there an ipad version? <comment333643> They're working on an iOS version right now. :-) <comment333644> Oh, ok thank you. <comment333646> You're welcome!
