Play count / Last played statistics intermittently don't update in iTunes <body> I have an iPod classic (160GB) which I sync with iTunes 10.6.0.40 using automatic syncing.  Generally, when I plug the iPod into my PC via USB, all of the strongPlay count/strong and strongLast played/strong statistics update properly.  Yesterday I listened to 5 albums on my iPod, in the following order:  ol liThe Pogues - If I should fall from grace with God/li liApples in Stereo - Fun trick noisemaker/li liJoni Mitchell - Court and spark/li liLed Zeppelin - Led Zeppelin III/li liUnderworld - Dubnobasswithmyheadman/li /ol  However, when I plugged the iPod into my PC, iTunes only showed that I had played the last 2 albums (Led Zeppelin, Underworld) and it was as if the other albums hadn't played (their strongLast played/strong dates were back in 2010).  Any idea what may be causing this?  Why doesn't iTunes respect my diverse taste in music?  strongEdit:/strong I have since upgraded to iTunes 10.6.1.7 and I am still seeing this issue, so I am now offering a bounty to anyone who can help me solve this.  <comment58892> Does the "Recently Played" list update in your iPod? <comment58955> @Andrew - it's updated on the iPod after I play the albums, but once I hook the iPod up to iTunes, it's like I never played certain albums (i.e. they don't appear in the Recently Played list on either the iPod or iTunes, and the Play Count/Last Played stats don't show the albums as having played recently). <comment58962> Try this: In the left-hand pane, right-click the name of the playlist, choose Edit Smart Playlist, and make sure that "Live Updating" is checked. <comment58969> @Andrew - thanks.  It is already checked.  I don't think this is an issue with the "Recently played" playlist (or any playlist for that matter).  As I said, the iPod/iTunes forgets that I ever played it (i.e. the Last Played date may be some date in 2010 despite the fact that I played it yesterday).  And yes, the date/time on both my iPod and iTunes is accurate. <comment59023> Does the play count update correctly when you play the same albums locally (i.e. in iTunes)? <comment59084> @kopischke - Yes, they do. <comment59212> It looks like it's a [common problem](https://www.google.com.au/#hl=en&safe=off&sclient=psy-ab&q=site:discussions.apple.com+itunes+ipod+sync+%22last+played%22+problem+automatically+sync&oq=site:discussions.apple.com+itunes+ipod+sync+%22last+played%22+problem+automatically+syn&fp=8c877c7548188a3b) - [here](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3923784?start=0&tstart=0)'s another person with a 160GB iPod Classic who believes their problems are due to the introduction of Match - could this be the cause of your issue?
