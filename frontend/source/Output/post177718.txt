VMWare Fusion 7: File Not Found <body> I screwed up big time when I tried deleting my Windows 7 VM on VMWare Fusion 7 on my Macbook Air. I put the VM in the Trash and emptied the trash. Now when I try to create a new VM, I get codeFile Not Found/code. I tried moving VMWare Fusion into the Trash so I can uninstall it and then reinstall it but it's not working. How do I fix my problem so I can install a more recent Windows VM? Thank you.  <answer199672> Just After installing the new VM you'll get the error "File not found".  ol liClick OK./li liRight-click on the VMware Fusion icon opened in the Dock./li liSelect "Virtual Machine Library"./li liDelete any left-overs from there. /li /ol  <comment210330> What did you delete - only the VM image (the one inside the Windows VM package) or the entire Windows VM package ?? <comment210331> The entire Windows VM package.
