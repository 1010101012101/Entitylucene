Is there a limit to the number of notifications that will show up on an iOS device's lock screen / notification center? <body> If so, what is the maximum size?  I tried googling around a bit and saw an off hand reference that implies the answer might be eleven, but I couldn't verify it in the apple documentation or even find a second reference.  <comment319701> It's not 11. I had probably 40 or 50 on my screen a few moments ago. Also presuming there is a limit on the lock screen, note that there would be a difference between the lock screen and Notification Center, as Notification Center shows all notifications that haven't been dealt with. <comment319720> 42.  It's the [answer to everything](http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/42).
