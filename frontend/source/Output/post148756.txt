What is keyboard shortcut to cycle through worksheets in excel (office 2011) workbook on mackbook air? <body> It looks like the shortcut is listed as Command+PageDown, but there's no "page down" on a mackbook air.  how can I cycle through the tabs (worksheets) in an excel workbook?  <answer148761> this reference sheet may help:  https://s3.amazonaws.com/wsp_sample_file/excel_mac_shortcuts.pdf  Perhaps : fn-ctrl-up / fn-ctrl-down Try this way: Ctrl+Page UP/Page Down to move Right/Left Tab  <answer148765> According to Apple's Mac notebooks: Key placement and functions:     kbdPage Up/kbd key functionality is performed by pressing kbdFn/kbd and kbdUp Arrow/kbd key.      kbdPage Down/kbd key functionality is performed by pressing kbdFn/kbd and kbdDown Arrow/kbd key.   <answer166991> option button and  up or down arrow  <comment175254> nailed it.  FN + command + up or down arrow cycles through the sheets.  Thanks! <comment195778> sorry the across buttons not up or down <comment195841> There's an accepted answer for this question already that differs from your answer.
