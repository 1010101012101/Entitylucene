How can I add a new search engine to Safari without any 3rd party add-ons? <body> I know add-ons such as Glims can do this, but I would rather stay away from them.  Any native (or more likely semi-native) way to do so?  If it matters, the engine I would like to add is duckduckgo.  <answer37248> No, the only options are Google, Bing, and Yahoo.  If it is of any help, DuckDuckGo have their own extension on the Apple website for Safari extensions.   <answer37662> MacHints just did a post on this. The basic premise is that you redirect Yahoo! Search via the hosts file to the search engine of your choice.  It works like a charm.  <answer66608> The Safari Extension anysearch allows you to change the search engine used by the Safari search bar/unibar, without any hack-ish stuff such as changing the hosts file.  <answer96144> in your /etc/hosts file, add this line:  precode184.72.115.86 search.yahoo.com /code/pre  then choose Yahoo as your default search.  <answer236935> This works with Safari 5.1.10 on Mac OS 10.6.8  To get Safari to open with duckduckgo (or any other) as search engine with no add ons or hacking type https://duckduckgo.com/&lt; (without the &lt;) into the Safari Preferences "Homepage" then set "New windows open with" to "Homepage" and "New tabs open with" "Homepage". This keeps the 3 default search engines as they were, at the top. OR just make the search engine of your choice a bookmark in the Bookmark bar and just click it/them.  <comment42246> Yeah, it's a shame that such a thing is not configurable without extensions. <comment212465> In one of the recent updates (much more recent than the question), Apple added DuckDuckGo as a search engine. <comment290071> Yeah, but that doesn't actually add it as a search engine, just changes what page windows/tabs open with.
