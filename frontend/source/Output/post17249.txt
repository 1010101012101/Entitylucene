How do i see the size of my trash in iPhoto '11? <body> I'm just curious how much space I'll retrieve by deleting them.  <answer17250> It's not that easy since iPhoto uses a database to track the files. When you trash the file, it simply removes the reference to that photo in whatever events and albums it used to be included.  It makes a reference to the original and modified files, so they don't actually get moved into a folder that you can get a quick estimate on the total trash size.  These pointers to a photo are so small that they are a rounding error compared even to the size of a small thumbnail of your photo.  The best way is to just get an estimate how large the typical picture you take is and see how much space a thousand of them take. You'll then be able to know if emptying the trash has any chance on making a difference size wise.   <comment18807> I'm quite sure this feature was in iPhoto '08, I think I'd just select all the photos and command-i to bring up the info pane. I might be wrong though. Thanks for the answer (I think the trash is around 12000 photos, taken with various cameras). <comment19843> I think you are right about older versions. They were slower for a reason - this database storage is a big reason why.
