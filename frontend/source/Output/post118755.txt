Mavericks update disconfigured my 3G dongle connection settings <body> I'm using a Vodafone Mobile Broadband dongle with software I've now updated to work with Mavericks but I now don't know what the correct APN / USERNAME / PASSWORD / IPv4 address and Domain Name System information to use.   Googling this stuff just comes back with a mess of forums that don't lead to satisfactory answers.   Is anyone a whizz with something like this?
