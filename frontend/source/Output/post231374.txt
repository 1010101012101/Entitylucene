Delete files required by OS X <body> Carbon copy cloner made a few copies of my hard drive when it was cloning some stuff for me, and put them in a SafetyNet folder.  It copied my library directory with some stuff in it, I was able to get a lot of the stuff erased with "Empty Trash."  Other items like these, I can't change permissions on them, I can't get them erased, even with third party tools. I can't get them erased with codesudo rm/code commands.   precode/Users/Henry/.Trash/_CCC SafetyNet/2015-08-05 (August 05) 12-47-55/System/Library/CoreServices/XProtect.bundle/Contents/_CodeSignature/CodeDirectory /Users/Henry/.Trash/_CCC SafetyNet/2015-08-05 (August 05) 12-47-55/System/Library/CoreServices/XProtect.bundle/Contents/_CodeSignature/CodeRequirements /Users/Henry/.Trash/_CCC SafetyNet/2015-08-05 (August 05) 12-47-55/System/Library/CoreServices/XProtect.bundle/Contents/_CodeSignature/CodeResources /Users/Henry/.Trash/_CCC SafetyNet/2015-08-05 (August 05) 12-47-55/System/Library/CoreServices/XProtect.bundle/Contents/_CodeSignature/CodeSignature /code/pre  Any ideas?  hr  And besides the files being protected, every directory on the way down is protected too. I have about twenty of these.  <answer231394> Assuming El Capitan is installed the files are probably still protected by System Integrity Protection due to their origin (/System/Library/CoreServices/XProtect.bundle...) though they are residing in your user's trash.
