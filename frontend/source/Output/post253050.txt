Can I use Applescript to go to the end of a text document? <body> I have a very, very basic question: I have a little Applescript file that cleans up the html tags in a Textwrangler document. At the last stop, I'd like it to go to the end of document and add a line of text within an em html tag. I don't know applscript. To get this far I simply used the record-macro button in the script editor, but now I need to do something like "Goto EOF, write XYZ.   Any help?  Thanks!  <answer253473> This will work-- it operates on the current TextWrangler document. Change "XYZ" to whatever you want.  precodetell application "TextWrangler"     set the_text to text of document 1     set text of document 1 to the_text &amp; return &amp; "&lt;em&gt;XYZ&lt;/em&gt;" end tell /code/pre  <comment315815> Awesome. Glad I could help.
