Why do Firefox and Chrome crash on my Macbook Pro? <body> I have trouble running Firefox and Chrome on my Mac.  Firefox is crashing from time to time: http://pastebin.com/UYYjPbZe  Chrome crashes right after installation, it couldn't run it even once: http://pastebin.com/3PQq88XC  Safari is running fine. I am not a Mac user, this is my first one but I'm starting to think Apple doesn't want to run other browser that won't be theirs. Could that be possible?
