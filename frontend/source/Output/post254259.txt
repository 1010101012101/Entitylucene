How can I get 3 Finger Gesture / Drag in new MacOs sierra? <body> In new MacOs Sierra , 3 finger gesture is not functioning . Any Solutions to get it back ?  <answer254268> I think this is what your afterâ€¦  Navigate to System Preferences  Accessibility  Mouse &amp; Trackpad  Trackpad Options.  Check the 'Enable dragging' checkbox, select 'three finger drag' from the dropdown.  <comment316559> This question is a bit vague.  There are [multiple 3-finger gestures](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204895).  Are you saying *none* of the 3-finger gestures work, only one of them doesn't or no gestures at all?  It's also helpful if you tell us what hardware you are using.  Remember, we're not there to look over your shoulder. <comment316573> But this is not available in new MacOs <comment316759> I am facing the same problem in Safari. Three finger drag works everywhere, except Safari: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/253938/three-finger-drag-not-working-in-safari-10 <comment317074> @GiriPPoonati Yes it is. I just reformatted my macbook and installed Sierra fresh. Three finger drag used to be in the generic trackpad gesture settings but it has been moved into the "mouse & trackpad" options in the Accessibility menu. This answer is correct and worked great. <comment317879> Ya the ThreeFinger drag is working now . Can u brief me the other options present over there like ' With and without Drag lock '
