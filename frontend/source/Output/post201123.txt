Why does this cause Mac OSX to print over SSH? <body> While screwing around and breaking things I came across these stupid commands (if executed in order it causes what I got):  codecd / &amp;&amp; cat vmlinuz/code  codecd /boot/ &amp;&amp; cat init*/code  It causes special characters that aren't recognized by the system like code���/code however, for some reason it causes weird effects like causing iTerm2 to send a bell (a notification to the system) like the screen shot:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uTB1o.png" alt="enter image description here"  However, the weirdest this is that is causes Mac OSX to print (screenshot):   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KkW7v.png" alt="enter image description here"  Can someone explain to my why this happens, especially over SSH?  Thanks in advance!  <answer201124> Terminal.app probably implements the "media copy" (printer) escape sequence from VT100s.  You can read about those control sequences at vt100.net, or in the XTerm Control Sequences, e.g.,  precodeCSI Pm i  Media Copy (MC).         Ps = 0  -&gt; Print screen (default).         Ps = 4  -&gt; Turn off printer controller mode.         Ps = 5  -&gt; Turn on printer controller mode. CSI ? Pm i       Media Copy (MC, DEC-specific).         Ps = 1  -&gt; Print line containing cursor.         Ps = 4  -&gt; Turn off autoprint mode.         Ps = 5  -&gt; Turn on autoprint mode.         Ps = 1  0  -&gt; Print composed display, ignores DECPEX.         Ps = 1  1  -&gt; Print all pages. /code/pre
