How to start SQL Developer with the correct Java Version? <body> I've Java 1.8 installed on my Mac OS Yosemite... and Terminal shows the following:  precodemccoy:~ daniel$ which java /usr/bin/java mccoy:~ daniel$ java -version java version "1.8.0_25" Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_25-b17) Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.25-b02, mixed mode) mccoy:~ daniel$ env | grep JAVA JAVA_OPTS=-Dnode.name=DANIEL -Xmx4g JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_25.jdk/Contents/Home/jre mccoy:~ daniel$  /code/pre  strongBut SQL Developer still starts with some older Java 1.7 and complains... how can I fix this?/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Fx5cO.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer174548> Install the 1.8 JDK, not only the JRE. :) Obviously you had the 1.7 JDK before but now you only have the JRE. :)   <answer174555> As @ruffin pointed out in the comment above I had to edit the package itself! It includes a codesqldeveloper.sh/code script that strongchanges/strong my currently set JAVA_HOME. Just had to comment it out!  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VHzT9.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment205517> It's the JDK already: `JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_25.jdk/...` – but I'll try to update anyway... <comment205526> See if [this post](http://www.thatjeffsmith.com/archive/2012/07/install-oracle-sql-developer-on-os-x-mountain-lion/) helps, down at the "But My SQL Developer is Using the Wrong JDK!?" section: `[A]ll you need to do is explore the SQL Developer package, and edit the sqldeveloper-Darwin.conf file in the bin directory. Update the ‘SetJavaHome’ line to point to the 1.7 JDK`
