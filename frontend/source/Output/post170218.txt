How can I monitor an installer as it modifies the filesystem on Yosemite? <body> fseventer does not support Yosemite until further notice and the suggestions here don't work for me so how can I monitor an installer as it writes files to the file system? I also tried Sloth but it only shows currently open files at a specific point in time.  <answer170220> This not application specific (it will show all) but you can find the one you are looking for.  iosnoop  This “traces” disk I/O execution live. Each time a disk I/O completes, a line of output is printed to summarize it, including process name and filename details:  Example:  precodesudo iosnoop  UID   PID D    BLOCK   SIZE       COMM PATHNAME    503 54079 R 286522800   4096 Google Chrome ??/Cache/data_2 /code/pre  <answer214787> h2Derman Enterprises File Control/h2     … makes it easy to determine what's been changed anywhere on your system. …   On OS X 10.11.1, attempts to analyse   precode/opt /code/pre  – during an installation by MacPorts – result in a 'No Items Were Processed' dialogue in File Control. So I assume that El Capitan is incompatible with such applications …  … but File Control emmight/em work with Yosemite. If not, please vote down this answer.   (I have El Capitan for test purposes, and I can run Mavericks later, but no Yosemite test environment.)  <comment259392> In Super User: http://superuser.com/a/997722/84988 under [View Filesystem Access in Real Time on Mac OS X](http://superuser.com/q/97980/84988)
