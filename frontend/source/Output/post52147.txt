Control arrow key to jump to the next word <body> I have OS X 10.6.8 and I run MS Word:Mac 2011.  I programmed the keyboard to allow me to jump from word to word in a document by hitting kbdControl/kbd + kbdArrow key/kbd.  This makes word processing much faster.  However, I lost this ability after an update some time ago.  Now, when I hit  kbdControl/kbd + kbdArrow key/kbd OS X cycles through what I believe are Spaces on my desktop.    This is hugely annoying and I have no interest in using Spaces.  I am perfectly happy to switch between apps using kbdAlt/kbd + kbdTab/kbd.  How do I go back to being able to use kbdControl/kbd + kbdArrow key/kbd to navigate in a document in MS Word?  Thanks!  <answer52152> To disable the shortcut for switching to spaces go to the keyboard shortcuts tab of the keyboard preferences pane. Select Mission Control on the left and then un-check the 'Move left/right a space' options.  <answer116159> It seems like OS X automatically re-assigns ⌥→ and ⌥← to jump one word forward/backward, as soon as you disable the 'switching space' shortcuts in the Mission Control.  System Preferences → Keyboard → Shortcuts and uncheck the Mission Control shortcuts  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rMZGU.png" width="400"
