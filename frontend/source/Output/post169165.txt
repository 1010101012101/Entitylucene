DriveDx shutdown count is very high <body> DriveDx claims that there have been 2051 power cycles on my Fusion SSD in 17 months.   For the Fusion Hard drive part it claims 6402 power cycles count.   SSD power on time has been 12250 hours and the hard drive 13343 hours?  This seems a lot as I keep my Mac on all the time and do force reboot very rarely only if nothing else helps = rarely.   Why would these numbers be like that. For the hard drive it would be 13 times a day and SSD 4 times a day. Energy saving is for hard drives is off?  This is Yosemite on iMac.  hr  For the SSD it claims wear levelling count 35%.  Hard drive seems to be failing but the SSD looks low too.  <comment198616> what is your sleep mode setting? <comment198749> Computer sleep maybe 3 hours - do not have access to my computer now. put hard disks to sleep not selected. <comment198750> every time it goes to sleep it is a shut down.
