How to archive on a non-gmail account on iOS without changing deleted items? <body> I am working with some new users for my work, and they used to use GMail as their primary email for work.  My company transferred over all their emails and data to an Office365 email.  Some users used to simply put files they had to go back to in the "Archive" folder.  So now the user is trying to do the same on their phone, and they are not prompted with the action.  I saw someone else post something similar and they got the answer to change the deleted files' location to an archive.  So the two questions I have are, does switching the deleted folder with the archive folder bring all the deleted files into their "archive" folder, and if they want to actually delete something, does it get mixed with their "archive"?  Lastly, if that is the case, is there another option?      Thanks!
