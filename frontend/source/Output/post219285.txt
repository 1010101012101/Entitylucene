How to back up iPhone / iPad without PC or iCloud? <body> Are there ways besides iCloud or using a computer with iTunes to back up data on your iPhone or iPad?br One way seems to be a USB flash drive with a lightning connector... But is that just for photos and not other data like internet bookmarks, notes, etc.?  <answer219288> I'd sayâ€¦ No.   The backup structure would require some kind of 'smart' object at the other end.br You cannot just connect a storage medium &amp; push data to it. It is just not designed that way.  <answer219292> The only other option I can think of would be iMazing. It will do backups and a whole lot more without jail breaking your iOS device.
