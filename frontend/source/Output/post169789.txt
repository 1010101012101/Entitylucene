determining Preferred Language in OS X via cli <body> I was hoping to do something like:  precodedefaults read -g AppleLanguages | awk -F, '/[^(]/{print $1;exit}' /code/pre  but if only one language is listed in "Preferred Languages", then defaults read -g AppleLanguages returns an error:     The domain/default pair of (kCFPreferencesAnyApplication, AppleLanguages) does not exist   It works fine if multiple languages are listed. Does anyone have a reliable way of determining the language selected for a given user in OS X?  <answer252431> The only difference is the comma.  Conditionally remove the comma if it's there.  precodedefaults read -g AppleLanguages | sed -n "2p" | tr -d , /code/pre  <comment199696> [Reposted from Unix.SE](http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/182083/reliable-method-to-determine-system-language-in-os-x)
