Installing Ubuntu via Boot Camp on 1st gen Macbook running Lion <body> Does anyone know if it's possible to install Ubuntu via bootcamp on a first gen Macbook running Lion? I'd prefer not to use Parallels/VMware due to the fact that it's only got 1GB of RAM in it and I'd prefer not to upgrade it.  <answer39692> h3Boot Camp steps/h3  ol liDownload Windows drivers for your Mac./li liPartition your hard drive to make space for Windows./li liSets your Mac to default boot into Windows after installation./li /ol  None of these options will help you  with your Ubuntu installation except for the partitioning. But this can also be done using Disk Utility. Therefore, I recommend using Disk Utility to change your partition scheme.

Do you not find Lion painfully slow? The minimum spec is 2GB! <comment44874> I've heard rumors that Apple's BootCamp software works fine for installing Ubuntu in exactly the same way it installs Windows, no rEFIt needed, is that not true? <comment44876> There really is not need to use BootCamp to install Ubuntu. Yes, you can boot into Windows/Ubuntu without rEFIt. You can select which partition to boot from by holding alt during boot.
