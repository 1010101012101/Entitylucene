Mac App Store without admin password? <body> Is there any way to use the Mac App Store without the administrator password? IE change it to install the app at code~/Applications/code instead of code/Applications/code?  <answer51025> According to one poster in an Apple discussion forum, this may be possible in Lion:     strongThis is possible with Lion./strong      There is a code_appstore/code group. All the users that are in this group are   allowed to install applications from the Mac App Store.   You can add   a user to this group with the strongworkgroup manager/strong (install codeserver   admin tool/code first). Or by typing in this command on the terminal.  precodedseditgroup -o edit -a shortusername -t user _appstore /code/pre   Unfortunately, this approach won't work in Snow Leopard or earlier versions of OS X. There also doesn't seem to be an option to install apps in a directory other than code/Applications/code.  <comment58425> OK. I'm on 10.6, and while the admins don't care about apps being installed, they don't like typing in the password for anything non-crucial. So, I guess I'm out of luck.
