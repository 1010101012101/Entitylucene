Run Automator App conditionally at system startup <body> i have build an Automator app working every time at system startup.  But sometime i wish to do not run it. There is a way to avoid (like holding a key at boot for example) Automator App runs when it do not need?   <answer99513> Here is an alternate method:  You can include the Automator app on Startup (System Preferences = Users and Groups = Login Items = Click code+/code and browse to codeAutomator.app/code in codeFinder/code. You can see an example here. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lurns.png" alt="enter image description here"  This will have it working every time on startup.  h2Turning it off (temporarily)/h2  If you hold the kbdShift/kbd key down just as your computer starts to log you into OS X (not when you hear the chime), it will ignore all of your login items. I could only get this working with automatic login disabled. You have to hit it right as your computer starts to log you in.  This may not be convenient if you have more codeLogin Items/code in your codeUsers &amp; Groups/code, but it is a good place to start.  h2References/h2  http://lifehacker.com/5795904/temporarily-disable-your-macs-login-items-with-the-shift-key  <comment117074> Thanks @sameetandpotatoes, good tricks! <comment117076> Thanks @sameetandpotatoes, good tricks!
