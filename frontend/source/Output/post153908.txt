After installing Yosemite, opening iPhoto brings my iMac to a halt <body> After installing Yosemite I attempted to open iPhoto on my 2008 iMac.  All my iMac does is show a white screen with a symbol of a file with a code?/code inside it. I cannot use my keyboard either.  What happened and how can I make iPhoto work again?  <answer153914> So everything was working fine, you opened iPhoto, and wham! ... a non-booting Mac? Something else has gone wrong here, and I doubt it's iPhoto. After installing Yosemite, did you do other things with it successfully, like browse the web, open a Word document?  From the screen you describe, the HD is the problem. Either it is completely dead, system files are missing/corrupted, a loose cable ... anything long those lines.  If you have a Time Machine backup of your HD, use OS X Recovery to recreate your startup disk.
