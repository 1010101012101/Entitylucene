Use sips to pad just the top of an image <body> I'm trying to add padding to the top of an image using the command line.  I've found the codesips/code command and I've tried  precodesips --padToHeightWidth 1300 1920 image.png /code/pre  on an image which is 1920 x 1080.  However this adds 50px of padding to the top and bottom.  Is it possible to just add 100px of padding to the top?  Is there another tool I should/could be using to do this?  <answer137316> I do not believe you can do that with codesips/code. I would recommend codeImageMagick/code which you can easily install using codeHomebrew/code. Then the command is:  precodeconvert  InputImage.jpg -background blue -splice 0x100 PaddedResult.jpg /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WLgMo.jpg" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/awfnh.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  If you want to add transparent padding, use:  precodeconvert  InputImage.jpg -background transparent -splice 0x100 out.png /code/pre  If you want to composite two images together, you can do this:  precodeconvert -size 1024x768 xc:blue 1024x768.jpg                    # create big blue image convert -size 100x100 xc:red 100x100.jpg                       # create little red image composite -gravity northeast 100x100.jpg 1024x768.jpg out.jpg  # superimpose top right /code/pre  Note that I am creating my images first, you can obviously just use your own.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/c4fc4.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment163389> Did this work for you? If so, please consider accepting it as the answer. If not, please say what went wrong so that I, or others, can assist you further. <comment163516> Thanks for your answer. Would I be able to add transparent padding to a png using this method. And also would I be able to overlay other images and combine them into a single image? e.g I have a 1024x768 image and a 100x100 image and I want to put the 100x100 image in the top right corner of the 1024x768 image <comment163520> Please have another look, I have updated my answer.
