Is it possible to have only one notification for a text message until the message is read? <body> I've been looking for a while but I cannot find out if I can limit it so that I only receive the first notification and no others until I've read the message.  There is a notification setting that will prevent the same text message from generating a follow up notification after a period of time (default is 2 minutes I believe).  I'm looking for a solution for Person A sends me 4 texts in the span of a minute. I'd like to not get a notification for messages 2 through 4 unless I've read 1.  <answer226275> Wouldn't it be Settings - Notifications - Messages - Repeat Alerts - Never?  <comment274855> I wish! That's for the 2 minute follow up on the same text message. I'll update the question to be clearer. <comment274856> Ah, indeed, it wasn't clear from your original question that you wanted to avoid notifications for further messages from the same user. I don't think such a setting exists. <comment274857> Sorry about that :/. Yeah I don't think there is anything either as I haven't found anything through Google myself.
