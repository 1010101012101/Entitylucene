How to group cpu cores in Activity Monitor (Mavericks 10.9.2)? <body> I've got MacBook Pro with 4 cores and Hyper-Threading(HT). I've also got a MacBook Air with two cores and HT.   On both devices I've set strongActivity Monitor/strong to show CPU History (View - Dock Icon - Show CPU History).  On the MBP there is only 1 graph and on MBA there are 4 graphs.  How could I make Activity Monitor icon to show one (combined) graph on the MBA too?  hr  h2MBP Screenshot:/h2  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XYTNE.png" alt="MBP Activity Monitor icon"  h2MBA Screenshot:/h2  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jJC0h.png" alt="MBA Activity Monitor icon"  <comment146126> Could you add screenshots of both? <comment185150> @Rob somehow I discovered your comment only now.
