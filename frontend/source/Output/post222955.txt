How can I stop iTunes from asking me to sign in to iCloud Music Library? <body> I don't understand. iTunes keeps sending me this message:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/l5FPE.png" alt="icloud-music-library-session-has-expired"  even though in System Preferences I am not signed in to iCloud music:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rZOh7.png" alt="icloud-system-preferences"  (There is, in fact, no option for iCloud Music to be found in iCloud System Preferences!)  Could it be that I am accessing my MacBook's iTunes music collection from an iPad? Does such sharing (under a LAN) constitute "signing in to iCloud Music"? If (hopefully) that's not the case, how do I stop the nagging message?  I emam/em keeping "Find My Mac" and "Keychain" enabled in the iCloud settings. Is it necessary to abandon these two as well to avoid the ongoing sign-in request?  <comment270279> Are you using Apple Music? Find  My Mac and Keychain has nothing to do with this.
