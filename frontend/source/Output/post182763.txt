However, there are some tools which are highly recommended you buy first before continuing as you have to remove the display and can break cables in the process.  Local retailers would likely be able to fix your battery for about $45-$50, if you choose to have it services either by an AASP or an unauthorized repair shop.  To do it yourself, check out this guide from iFixIt. It will walk you through step-by-step (with pictures) and you can also buy the battery + all requisite tools via their website.
