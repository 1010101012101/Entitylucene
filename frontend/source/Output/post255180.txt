Countif formula help that references multiple tables/sheets <body> So the current formula I'm using has been working but what i need to do is autofill it down from week 1 to week 17, and I'm manually changing the formula to be directed to the week # sheet that's associated with that line. The location inside each sheet/table is exactly the same N24:N39.  I'd like to be able to set a formula to be able to reference the sheets automatically without having to manually route it to the correct sheet.  I was trying INDIRECT formulas, but nothing was coming back successful.  I'm very lost in finding the right add to this formula.  =IF(COUNTIF(Week 1::N24:N39,"49ers")=0,"",COUNTIF(Week 1::N24:N39,"49ers"))
