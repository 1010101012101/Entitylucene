Internet Sharing on a University Network - Will it screw things up? <body> I am currently running PureVPN on my University's network as I live in halls. This is running on my Mac. I wish to use the VPN on my PS4, and I have found a guide on how to do this which involved connecting my PS4 to the mac with a crossover cable and enabling Internet Sharing in my Mac's settings.  Here is the guide for PureVPN: https://www.purevpn.com/blog/ps3-vpn/  So to make this clear - my Mac is picking up WiFi, and is using PureVPN. My PS4 is connected to my Mac with a crossover cable.  However, when I go to enable internet sharing on the mac it gives me the following, somewhat chilling message -  "Are you sure you want to turn on Internet sharing? If your computer is connectd to a network, turning on Internet sharing may affect the network settings of other computers and disrupt the network. Contact your system administrator before turning on internet sharing."  What's the likelihood of things going haywire?  I'm using MacBook Pro 2015 , Yosemite.
