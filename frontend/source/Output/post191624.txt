Can not copy and paste within Chrome from time to time <body> Chrome Mac is a bit dodgy, I can not use copy/paste function from time to time, both kbd Cmd âŒ˜ /kbd kbd C /kbd  and right-click menu. I must reopen it to enable copy/paste again.  OS X version is 10.10.3, Chrome version is 41.0.2272.118  Firefox and Safari do not have such problem.  <answer194713> This seems to have been a problem for a L-O-N-G time now.  Here is a issue from 2009: Copy and paste issues on google crome  While I am not a fan of Safari and I really hate FF, I found Chrome fast but full of issues.  My fix?  Opera.  It's not great, but it seems to be the best that we've got at present.  I am using it exclusively across platforms - OS X, Linux and Windows 7 - and it is very stable.  It's based on the Chrome engine, but doesn't seem to have the issues Chrome has.  For example, I have yet to deal with the Cut/Paste issue on OS X 10.10 and Opera.  <answer287517> I have the same problem with a copy and paste operating in Chrome, but it only happens from time to time, which makes it all the more frustrating... namely, its unpredictability.  I have found one solution that solves the problem quite consistently, it is called Firefox.  <comment227572> reopen or reload ? <comment227573> I meant the whole application can not copy paste, all pages. Reload can not fix this. Must reopen it. <comment227574> Dear @sanigo, first of all, pls, read this: https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-ask Then, pls, add versions of Mac OS and Chrome. Do you have any specific apps working with keyboard, i.e. Typinator etc. which may interfere with cmd+C? Does your problem appears on any specific pages? Some of them might block copy/paste functionality. <comment227578> The OSx version is 10.10.3, Chrome version is 41.0.2272.118, I did not give the versions because chrome has this issue all of the versions I have used, Cmd+C is usable in all apps but chome when it happened.  It is not about any specific pages, it is  all pages and even i close all pages and reopen. The only solution is quit chrome totally and reopen. <comment227579> I have install an extension named "Easy Copy Paste", when i can not copy/pase by right menu and Cmd+C/V, I can use the extension to copy/paste. <comment227583> Just wondering it that extension is creating problems ? <comment227584> I don't think so. I installed the extension after I have the problem. It is a temporary work around. <comment227585> I am wondering whether a single page that disables copy/paste could affect the whole app and all pages? <comment230981> Hi, Any news on this issue ? I experience the same problem and it is really annoying... <comment230982> Same here on Windows. Probably a chrome bug. <comment231173> It seems that the only work around is to install "Easy Copy Paste" extension or reopen chrome. <comment231174> Now I feel better to know that I am not the only this issue facer. <comment303780> This is a bloody annoying issue. <comment367306> Similar: [Copy and paste stops working](https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/131873/22781) <comment367319> I'm not sure why all the down votes if another browser doesn't spoil copy paste. I get not everyone would switch browsers, but if you know it's specific to one application - you can focus on Chrome settings or an update to fix it.
