Can one slice of a "Disk Utility" RAID mirror be moved to a new computer? <body> With a 2-disk RAID mirror created in Disk Utility, after one disk fails, can the remaining good disk be moved to a different Mac and used successfully?  <answer124434> Theoretically, yes.  But remember Apple's RAID solution is software based so both computers should have the same O/S versions.   But if you are moving a boot volume AND the hardware is the same it should be cake.  Moving a boot volume to DIFFERENT hardware... well I've never tried that. It might work and it SHOULDN'T damage the drive data.   YMMV  <comment145591> It's not a boot volume.
