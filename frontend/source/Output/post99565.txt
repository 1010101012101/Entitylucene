How do I set Mail.app not to send the recipient names as they appear in my address book <body> When I send mails to addresses from my address book, the recipients in the address bar are shown like codename &lt;nick@domain.tld&gt;/code. Can I somehow prevent that name part, so that only the actual mail address is shown and not the names, as I name them in my personal address book? I kind of feel like it's not for the public how I name my contacts.  <answer99580> While composing and email you can click the arrow in the address and choose emEdit Address/em or double-click the address to edit the information. By deleting the name and leaving just the email address (it should look something like code&lt; someone@somewhere.com &gt;/code) should do the trick. I couldn't find a way of having this changes done permanently, though.  <comment117225> There is no way to permanently disable this behavior, without switching to a mail client that doesn't do this. (Every modern mail client that I am aware of does so, though.)
