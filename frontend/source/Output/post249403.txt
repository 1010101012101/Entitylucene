Why won't an fsck-declared-good volume mount? <body> I have a CoreStorage logical (virtual), encrypted volume that will not mount, even though codefsck_hfs/code declares it clean. Does anyone know what the deal is here?  Here is the drive information:  precode/dev/disk4 (external, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *960.2 GB   disk4    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk4s1    2:          Apple_CoreStorage Discover                959.3 GB   disk4s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk4s3 /dev/disk5 (external, virtual):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                  Apple_HFS Discover               +959.0 GB   disk5                                  Logical Volume on disk4s2                                  9BB5BE72-0024-46D2-A1BB-69AB51247E06                                  Unlocked Encrypted /code/pre  where codedisk5/code is the unlocked, but not mounted virtual volume. Here are the results of codefsck_hfs/code on the unlocked virtual volume:  precode** /dev/rdisk5    Executing fsck_hfs (version hfs-305.10.1). ** Checking Journaled HFS Plus volume.    The volume name is Discover ** Checking extents overflow file. ** Checking catalog file. ** Checking multi-linked files. ** Checking catalog hierarchy. ** Checking extended attributes file. ** Checking volume bitmap. ** Checking volume information. ** Trimming unused blocks. ** The volume Discover appears to be OK. /code/pre  I had put in the password for the encryption, and as I would expect, codefsck_hfs/code seems quite able to read the encrypted data, without it being mounted. This is what happens when I try to mount:  precode% diskutil mount 9BB5BE72-0024-46D2-A1BB-69AB51247E06 disk5 is a CoreStorage Logical Volume which failed to mount % diskutil mount disk5                                disk5 is a CoreStorage Logical Volume which failed to mount /code/pre  Of course, no clue is given as to emwhy/em it failed to mount.  I am running the latest El Capitan.
