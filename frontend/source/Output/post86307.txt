Can I list files ordered by date added to a folder from a command-line tool like ls? <body> I need to build a script that shows files in the same order as the default Downloads folder in the dock, ordered by Date Added, newest first. I can't seem to find the option in codels/code.   Any other way to do it?  <answer86309>    man ls  precode -U      Use time of file creation, instead of last modification for          sorting (-t) or long output (-l). /code/pre   <answer86317> The date added is stored as metadata item codekMDItemDateAdded/code and the codemdls/code command will expose the data for each file passed as an argument to it.  So, to dump the date added for all files in Downloads in whatever arbitrary order * gets expanded by your shell, you can:     mdls -name kMDItemDateAdded ~/Downloads/*   You'll need to hack together some combination of find and sed/awk/perl/whatever to assemble a replacement for codels/code but perhaps mdfind can be called by your script rather than needing to reinvent codels/code and parsing that output.  <answer86374> Well, as usual, after writing the question I start digging for metadata content in files, and ended up writing this:  precodels -a | \ grep -v '^\.$\|^\.\.$' | \ xargs -I {} mdls -name kMDItemFSName -name kMDItemDateAdded {} | \ sed 'N;s/\n//' | grep -v '(null)' | \ awk '{print $3 " " $4 " " substr($0,index($0,$7))}' | \ sort -r /code/pre  Basically it: 1. list all files 2. filters out . and .. 3. gets the name and date added, one line after the other 4. merges every two lines into 1 line 5. extracts the date, time and name 6. sorts it in reverse (since datetime is upfront, it sorts by datetime)  Hope it helps someone else! :)  @bmike actually, the site imposed me a restriction to answer my own question only after 8 hours of posting my question, due to my lack of reputation :D  <answer198424> Simpler (Faster) solution:  precodemdls -name kMDItemFSName -name kMDItemDateAdded -raw * | \ xargs -0 -I {} echo {} | \ sed 'N;s/\n/ /' | \ sort /code/pre  <comment99657> Display it *where*? <comment99658> Command line!.Got it! I ended up writing a one liner that does the trick. Since I dont have much reputation, I cannot answer my own question yet, I'll do it later. <comment99659> nope, I need date added, not date created. Same as the default downloads folder in the dock <comment99662> how is date added not the same as date created? <comment99675> Jason - date created is when the file was created so when Safari downloads a file from another computer, it was clearly created for that download or could have been created months or years before the download happens. See my answer for details on where this data gets stored on OS X. <comment99678> Welcome to the site Ramiro - you should be able to answer your own question any time - but there will be a restriction for you to "mark as accepted" your answer. Feel free to edit my answer to suit your needs or provide your own answer if/when you like. <comment99696> Yes! I found it later and made a beautiful one liner that teached me a lot of things :) Thanks for the help <comment99708> Paste that one liner in by editing my answer - share the knowledge! <comment99754> oh, I split the one liner in several lines for clarity only :) <comment129666> Use `ls -A` instead of `-a` so you don't have to `grep -v` for `.` and `..`. <comment237836> yep, much better :)
