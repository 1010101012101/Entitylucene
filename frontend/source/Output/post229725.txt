Why is there a generic folder icon for Library in the "Go" menu? <body> Usually, when in the codeGo/code menu in codeFinder/code, there are icons for each item, for exampleimg src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kHZBC.png" alt="Go Menu"  However, when I hold the kbdoption/kbd key and Library shows up, it has a generic folder icon instead of a court-like icon:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SH7Pb.png" alt="Library"  I have since upgraded to El Capitan, but it has been that way since Yosemite. The only thing I can think of that may have caused this is setting the code~/Library/code folder to codenohidden/code using codechflags/code, but setting it back to codehidden/code does not fix the issue.  Is this new behavior(I doubt it), or a glitch on my part? How could I fix it?  <answer229726> Unfortunately, there is no Sidebar icon for the Library folder in Yosemite and El Capitan. The sidebar icons are used for the codeGo/code menu items as well.  The icon that was used in the past in the  (Mavericks and before), was (to my knowledge) codeToolbarLibraryFolderIcon.icns/code, which does not exist anymore.  You can view the Sidebar icons that do exist in code/System/Library/CoreServices/CoreTypes.bundle/Contents/Resources/code. They are named in the format codeSidebar&lt;FOLDERNAME&gt;Folder.icns/code.  Interestingly, the Library folder icon (for the folder itself in Finder) does still exist, as codeLibraryFolderIcon.icns/code  <comment280396> +1(when I have the rep), but if I create the `ToolbarLibraryFolderIcon.ics`, will the library icon be back? <comment280400> Not likely, the systems handling the icons wouldn't be looking for it.
