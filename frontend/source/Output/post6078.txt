How do I disable this message: "the disk was not ejected properly"? <body> Is there any way to disable the "the disk was not ejected properly" message?  I use a KVM and need to switch between two systems and have a memory stick that is in the KVM. The problem is that it's very annoying to get the message every time I switch from one computer to the other. I know, I can unmount it (and probably should), but I switch all the time, so it's a inconvenience to unmount, and there is nothing sensitive on the memory stick.  <answer6532> Certainly not an elegant answer but, you can disable UserNotificationCenter.app found in /system/library/coreservices - replace it with another app or file with the same name. It will stop any warnings popping up (including that your drive is full) so watch out for that, but in my experience it does what you are looking for.  I actually did this to my mac a long time ago, and forgot about it until you asked you question. Credit to Macpadawon at http://macosx.com/forums/mac-os-x-system-mac-software/297194-disable-device-removal-message.html for the answer - same place I found my answer a couple of years back.  <answer12701> Much better to do this:  precodesudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.UserNotificationCenter.plist /code/pre  Which will just stop the UserNotificationCenter service from running, leaving your system files intact!  substrongbeware:/strong as noted in the comments, this will disable all system notifications, including those when programs request access to system services like contacts/sub  <answer222205> Ok. The issue with flash drives or other USB drives is this; whenever you write data to a drive... ANY drive on your system, the data is first written to a buffer in memory. Later, when the computer gets around to it, it will flush the buffers to the device (hard drive, SSD, or any USB device). That may be instantaneous (at least to us mere mortals) or it may take a few seconds. The possible delay means that if you yank a USB device before the buffers have flushed (or the fluffers have bushed) you may end up with a corrupted drive, or a set of corrupted files on the drive.  For those in the know, if you only read from a device, then there is NO NEED to flush the write buffers before you yank to your heart's content. So... The annoying MAC OS X warning is most probably NOT relevant to most users. Especially if you are only reading from the USB device.  If you happen to write to a USB device, the odds of the system not completing a buffer flush before the hardware is yanked, is very small.  Therefore Apple emNEEDS/em to provide a way to disable individual messages for power users. Don't treat everyone as a n00b who can't be relied on to know how their computer works.  But... welcome to the "walled garden". If you are a power user using a Mac, well, you just get used to the various, myriad annoyances that you have no control over. If you want a POSIX-based OS and full control, I'm not going to offer any suggestions...  Charlie74. I disagree. While my answer may ramble a bit, it is an explanation of why the message happens. To your point that an answer has been given, I must disagree. Disabling the entire notification subsystem is NOT an acceptable solution, just as removing the battery from your cell phone is NOT an acceptable solution to receiving too many telemarketing calls. The notification subsystem is important and should not be disabled just because the OP finds one of the many myriad of messages to be annoying.    <comment6323> Sorry, I have no answer. However keep in mind, that message is to remind you that data is held in memory and not yet written to the disk. Which is particularly important when you switch often. <comment6325> I've done this a long time and I have never lost anything. I'm not saying it won't happen, but I'm willing to take the risk. <comment6352> Okay, I have to ask: anyone know why we got three near-identical questions within 10 hoursâ€”this one, [6090](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/6090/disable-not-ejected-properly-warning-as-only-charging-and-not-writing-data), and [6108](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/6108/disable-file-system-cache-for-usb-devices) (and yes, the latter two have been closed as dupes). <comment6357> @Dori It's the time after Christmas, so new Macs or Cameras with SD Cards :) Although I would like to point out that my question specifically was asking about the Write Cache, which is what the warning is usually about (ignoring issue like Symlinks/open system files on the drive) <comment6365> I hear what you are saying, that you would rather take the chance on losing the memory stick, I just thought I would let you know that it does happen; I found this forum because I didn't eject my memory stick before disconnecting and wasn't able to access the 1.8gb worth of movies that I just took. Luckily Disk Utility was able to fix it, this time. <comment6366> @cate,@chrisparker2000: I converted your answers to comments.  I understand your positions, but the OP states in his question that he does not care about losing data. So in this case, the posts are really commentary and not answers to the question. <comment6369> also, see http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/questions/246/non-answers-disguised-as-answers-and-non-questions-disguised-as-questions <comment6399> @chrisparker2000: I've never heard of a drive being physically destroyed by not ejecting it.  Where are you getting this information?  How does a memory stick become so "corrupt" that it can't be reformatted? <comment6843> Wow.  Nice catch.  I certainly wouldn't do this to my own system, but it's nice to know it can be done.  I suppose the app could be replaced with an empty file. <comment6915> I've done it on three different macs with no issues, although most of the time I just unmount things as well. <comment7083> At least you did not *notice* any issues, right? Sorry, couldn't resist. :-) <comment13323> Will it continue to be unloaded after restarting my Mac? <comment13335> Unloading a launchctl plist persists across restart, so I believe so. That said, I hardly ever reboot, so haven't tested it yet! <comment13849> (I rebooted, and it has persisted fine :) <comment111874> That solution has a negative side effect: It will also hide those "xy-application would like access to your contacts" popups. To revert it: `sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.UserNotificationCenter.plist` <comment201476> Yeah this is very dangerous. It will most likely stop you from getting notifications from the system. In 2011, notifications were not a big deal but they kind of are today in 2015. <comment249687> @dermike EXCEPT ... the problem is ... There is literally zero risk of that happening most of the time: Apple currently pops up the mesage in ALL cases, including the ones where there have been zero writes since the disk was inserted. You can't corrupt data if you have no data! <comment269214> So, I'm not sure this ramble really qualifies as an answer to the question...  however an answer was already provided that does exactly what you are rambling can't be done - the messages can be disabled.     However, as this does not attempt to provide any answer to the question, I'm going to flag this for deletion. <comment270609> @Charlie74 It's an attempt to make a point, so I'm not deleting it. I will edit out the vague chit chat towards the end. If OP wants to be clear, feel free to provide a positive explanation of why OS X is POSIX certified - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX#POSIX-certified and not POSIX-based. <comment357443> Is there any recommended way to do this so that it doesn't persist?
