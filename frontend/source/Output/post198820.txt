Allowing cookies from a specific site in Safari <body> I'm a new Mac user and I have a financial site which says I must allow cookies...and I'm okay with that, I just don't know how to do that. I've looked in my settings and preferences but it appears I have to allow cookies for everyone or no one at all. Would someone be able to help me? I'd rather not add additional programs if I can avoid it... OS X must be able to do this, right?  <answer198823> Go to strongSafari's/strong settings and from there you can allow certain sites to leave cookies.  There are several other settings worth investigating here too.  To get to settings, from the Menu click strongSafari/strong  strongPreferences.../strong and go to the strongPrivacy/strong tab.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vhela.png" alt="Cookies in Safari settings"  <comment238066> What version of OS X and Safari are you using?
