Xcode uses 600 MB–800 MB memory when idle <body> Xcode 5 is the only IDE I use for everything. It's best for debugging C++ programs. The only problem is that I have a MacBook Pro (Late 2012) and only 4 GB RAM. Xcode hogs all the memory all the time. The scenario is like this:  ol liOpen Xcode → do compiling/debugging  emAt this point Xcode will be using around 100 MB–150MB (depends)/em/li liLeave it as idle process (don't use for 15–20 minutes)/li liOpen Activity Monitor to check memory used by Xcode.  emSometimes it reaches 600 MB–800 MB without doing anything. How?/em/li /ol  I am attaching 2 pics taken 10–15 mins apart. In 2supnd/sup screenshot there is a jump of almost 150 MB extra. Although it's not that much, sometimes it reaches 800 MB.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mf0C7.png" alt="" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JmMwn.png" alt=""  I have Googled a lot about solutions. People say different things like restarting Xcode in a while or "You have some problem. Try restarting your PC." but I don't think it's a solution. Does anyone have a solution? I have tried everything detailed in this Apple Support Communities thread and already disabled Source control. Still no luck.  <comment229122> Xcode is a bit of a dog when it comes to memory usage. Right now, with all the windows closed, my Xcode is using 228MB. That's pretty hard to justify... <comment229319> @Froggard: Closing all the processes is considered as best case.we should check average case always :) <comment229323> ...what? I don't understand.
