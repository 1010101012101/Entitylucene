View play counts on iPad or iPhone? <body> Is it possible to view play counts on iPad, or iPhone, in the Music app, like one can in iTunes?  I am running iOS 6.  <answer74462> The Music app is pretty limited in terms of the metadata it displays. At the moment it's not possible to view the play counts for songs.  Third party apps can access your music collection, but I'm not sure how much metadata is exposed to them. It may be possible to see play counts with a third party app, but I don't know for sure, nor do I know of any apps that do this.  <answer129852> There's an app for iOS 7 than now allows you to do it, it's called PlayCounts. It allows you to create playlist on the fly by selecting play counts of the songs, and see how many times you have played each song.  <answer296302> For anyone looking for the answer to this in 2017, the previously mentioned PlayCounts app seems to be no longer available. There's a free app called Song Data that works for this now.  <comment152019> Could you add a link to the app so people don't have to search for it? <comment291671> Looks like the app is no longer available in the App Store?
