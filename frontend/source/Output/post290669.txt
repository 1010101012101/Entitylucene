Dictionary application needs to download dictionary "Apple Dictionary" before use <body> I'm repeatedly being asked to download the "Apple Dictionary" when I open the dictionary application. This doesn't happen every time I open it. I haven't pinned down specific usage cases where this message appears, but I think it may be every time after I reboot my computer. Is there anyway for the Dictionary application to remember that I have "Apple Dictionary" permanently? This has only started happening after I upgraded from OSX Mountain Lion to macOS Sierra.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Gvc7U.png" alt="screenshot of dictionary message"  <comment366931> I'm running Sierra. When I first setup dictionary I selected Oxford Dictionary. Whenever I open dictionary it works fine.  I even get a selection box at top to switch between Oxford, Apple, a Thesaurus, and Wikipedia.  I don't know if choosing Oxford made a difference or not.
