How can I add support for .flac files in SoX? <body> I want SoX to record audio in .flac files. When I do:  precoderec -t flac ~/Desktop/myrec.flac /code/pre  …it gives the following error:  precoderec FAIL formats: no handler for given file type `flac' /code/pre  I have installed SoX from 'brew' and and I do have flac 1.2.1 installed.  I have gone though man pages at http://sox.sourceforge.net/sox.pdf but did not get the information that I am looking for.  How can I add support for .flac files?  I am on OS X 10.9.3  <answer140931> Try this:  precodebrew remove libogg flac sox brew update brew doctor brew install libogg flac brew install sox /code/pre  This should recompile sox with libogg and flac present, and it will then find the FLAC support.  precode~$ brew info sox sox: stable 14.4.1 http://sox.sourceforge.net/ /usr/local/Cellar/sox/14.4.1_1 (15 files, 2.1M) *   Built from source From: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/Library/Formula/sox.rb ==&gt; Dependencies Build: pkg-config ✔ Required: libpng ✔, mad ✔ Optional: opencore-amr ✘, libvorbis ✔, flac ✔, libsndfile ✔, libao ✘, lame ✔ ==&gt; Options --with-flac     Build with flac support --with-lame     Build with lame support --with-libao     Build with libao support --with-libsndfile     Build with libsndfile support --with-libvorbis     Build with libvorbis support --with-opencore-amr     Build with opencore-amr support /code/pre  <answer167040> Keeping it simple.   Removing it using brew like so :  precodebrew remove sox /code/pre  Then installing it again with specific options, like so, did the trick for me:  precodebrew install sox --with-lame --with-flac --with-libvorbis /code/pre  You may want to remove the code--with-lame/code option if you won't be using MP3s, or the code--with-libvorbis/code if you won't be using OGG.  I hope this helps someone.   <comment168342> I have tried above steps. But still the same issue. <comment168343> here is my output of brew info sox sox: stable 14.4.1 http://sox.sourceforge.net/ /usr/local/Cellar/sox/14.4.1_1 (15 files, 2.0M) *   Built from source From: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/Library/Formula/sox.rb == Dependencies Build: pkg-config ✔ Required: libpng ✔, mad ✔ Optional: opencore-amr ✘, libvorbis ✘, flac ✔, libsndfile ✘, libao ✘, lame ✔ == Options --with-flac  Build with flac support --with-lame  Build with lame support --with-libao  Build with libao support --with-libsndfile  Build with libsndfile support --with-libvorbis . . . . <comment169043> When I do the same, the only difference is that I have libsndfile and libvorbis as well. rec is working for me to create a .flac file. What happens if you repeat the steps above, but also install vorbis and libsndfile? `brew install libogg flac libsndfile libvorbis` <comment183547> Today, when I installed `sox` from Homebrew (no extra options), FLAC support just worked out of the box. <comment195791> Following EgregiousClam's instructions did not work for me the first time around because trying to remove libogg failed with 'Error: No such keg: /usr/local/Cellar/libogg'. I did not pay much attention at the time and gave it another shot, now converting from FLAC does work. -- In other words: make sure the remove command does execute successfully (or you could try removing all three programs with separate `brew remove` commands.) <comment262941> Thank you, this also solves sox FAIL formats: no handler for detected file type `vorbis' . How strange those are not in by default. <comment291948> You can also just `brew reinstall` instead of `brew remove`, `brew install`.
