Recovery Disk Assistant which is downloaded from Apple website./li /ul  Purpose:  ul liMake a recovery Yosemite disk on USB stick/li /ul  Procedure:  ul liDownloaded Recovery Disk Assistant fro Apple/li liexecuted Recovery Disk Assistant on Yosemite/li /ul  Problem:   The recovery disk assistant has fixed image and text. There is a Lion photo image, not Yosemite and it said successfully made Lion recovery disk.  So I am wondering whether I got Lion recovery or Yosemite recovery...  <answer202039> Yes, it is a Yosemite recovery USB flash drive. The application copies the hidden (internal disk) recovery partition to the flash drive. I believe Apple no longer recommends using a recovery flash drive, so I suppose they have not updated the Recovery Disk Assistant application. I believe Apple now wants you to keep a bootable copy of OS X on an external drive. Still, the recovery flash drive is good to have if you need to download and install a fresh copy of OS X (and your internal recovery partition is damaged). Some will argue you can just boot using internet recovery to reinstall OS X, but you will get the version of OS X that was shipped with the machine. If you keep your flash drive up to date, then you can download the current version of OS X (that you have installed).
