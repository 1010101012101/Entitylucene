Is there a way to make iPhone forget the data belonging to one app? <body> I recently downloaded an app (Rival Knights) which I already had on my iPad, but not on my phone. It gave me the option to write over my saved data and I declined. However now, I've changed my mind and want to start again.  I've tried deleting and re-installing the app, completely resetting my iPhone, deleting the app from my game centre, and making a new apple ID, however none of these have worked.  Is there any other way I can make my phone forget the app so I have a chance of starting again?  <answer177818> If you delete the app, all the data from that app gets deleted.  That is how the phone forgets that app.  If the app uses Game Center or another log in to retrieve game state from servers online, then you'll need to temporarily sign out of Game Center and possibly iCloud to remove those files from the phone as well.  I'd start by signing out of Game Center and delete/reinstall the game.  If that doesn't work, you can either check the specific game / contact that developer and/or sign out of iCloud documents or inspect that data store to see if that game has cloud files.  Once you have a clean start, you will know how to force a change to the cloud to reset the progress to be new.  <answer245431> I had a similar issue on my iPad. I think I fixed it!  I wanted to reset the game and realised simply reinstalling the game from the App Store didn't mean starting new game. Here's what I did.  ol liDelete Rival Knights app./li liReinstall the Rival Knight app from App Store/li liGo to strongiCloud  Storage  Manage Storage  Backups/strong (at the top) /li liTap strongThis iPad/strong (or iPad name) strong Backup Options/strong/li liTap 'Show All Apps' in Backup Options /li liThere is then a list of the apps on your device and the option to switch off the data back up for individual apps. Find Rival Knight app and you can switch off the data back up./li liA pop up window asks "Do You Want to Turn off Rival Knights Backups and Delete the Data from iCloud?" Choose "Delete." /li liGo back to your home screen and play Rival Knights, you will be playing a brand new game!  /li /ol  <comment210350> They've probably stored your device token on their servers or iCloud. Check to see if it's in your iCloud storage <comment210351> I don't believe it is as I don't have my iCloud enabled, I don't have anything stored in there. <comment210365> Many ways to keep track of you. Web site cookies (delete them), your IP address (use Proxy server), file saved in your Library registry (find and delete) ect... <comment210694> Thank you, I tried deleting it and logging out, but unfortunately it didn't work. I've sent an email to the developers now, hopefully they'll get back to me soon. Thank you for your advice. <comment210699> @hydraulic0 You're welcome. Please share your results here.
