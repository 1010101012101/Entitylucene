Iphone 4s charging problem...? <body> My IPhone 4s recently decided to stop charging for some reason. If I put the charger into my iPhone, it doesn't respond at all, doesn't charge or give any signal its charging. The only thing the charger has effect on is when my iPhone is completely off, it will go on if I put the charger in. So far I didn't find a similar problem so maybe someone knows what's wrong/has had this problem already and maybe have an answer for me?  <comment209924> Perform a soft reset. A soft reset restarts your phone and does not erase any of your content or data.      Press and hold the Power key and Home key.     Release both keys when the screen goes black.     Then press and hold the Power key until your Apple iPhone 4s restarts. <comment209925> Thank you for your comment, but it didn't work unfortunately... Do you have any other suggestions? <comment209929> how is your battery doing? must be 3 Years or more old. <comment209931> Have you backed up the phone and performed a full DFU restore? That should solve any software issue, though it sounds more likely to be hardware failure. <comment209935> That's what I think as well, so I am going to have to fix the battery or some sorts, but thanks anyway.
