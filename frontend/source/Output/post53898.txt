Enlightenment on Lion - make default WM <body> I ran the Enlightenment e16.dmg file from here, http://trac.enlightenment.org/e/wiki/MACOSX , it works pretty good, but it runs on top of the mac osx default Window Manager (Quartz Compositor? i think its called).  Is there a way to just run the enlightenment manager?    <answer53907> You mean, booting into an X11 powered Window Manager instead of the Finder and Quartz? No, this is not possible (unless you install Linux of course and boot this directly).  <answer53910> Apparently Aqua and Quartz-wm (the X11 implementation) can't be separated, if someone is a glutton for punishment, then they could get XFree86 to work, like was outlined in this thread, http://hintsforums.macworld.com/showthread.php?t=21116 .  But then you can't run native Mac apps which try to communicate with quart-wm, so its kind of pointless.
