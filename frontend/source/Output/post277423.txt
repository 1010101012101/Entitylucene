How do I determine what processes were running when I shut the lid? <body> On multiple occasions when I have shut my Mac there have been issues with it sleeping. In particular, it has been hot to the touch and I've had the battery drained. I assume that one process is running when it is supposed to be asleep. How can I determine what process or processes were consuming the most resources while my lid was closed?
