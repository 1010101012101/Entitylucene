External windows mouse invert scroll except touchpad <body> I just attached an external windows mouse to my mac and I inverted the scrolling. But now it also inverts it for the touchpad... Is there a way to invert it only for the external mouse? I really don't want to switch it up every time...  <answer126744> I've had a simular issue as an inverted (external) mouse is pretty... strongannoying/strong. If you never use another computer, you will get used to it eventually.  But if you would like to customize buttons, I would recommend you steermouse as per their site:     SteerMouse is a mouse driver that lets you freely customize buttons,   wheels and cursor speed. Both USB and Bluetooth mice are supported, no   matter whether the mouse is designed for Windows or Mac.   <answer126760> This is Apple redefining normal. For me it is fine on a trackpad but counter intuitive with a scroll wheel. It started on O/S X Lion and I have been using a little utility called Scroll Reverser to change the behavior:  https://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/37872/scroll-reverser
