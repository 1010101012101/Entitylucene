slow starting up after a clean install of windows 10 <body> I decided to remove os X and install windows 10 without boot camp in my macbook air 2014. So I formatted the whole disk and used MBR partition table and installed windows 10 on the disk.  Everything works fine except the startup.  When I push the power button, the macbook give out the familiar sound and then the screen remains black for about 20 seconds before windows 10 begins to start up. How can I fix this?  <comment265074> You blew away the part of the drive that tells it which OS it should boot to, so every time is has to search til it finds one. <comment265075> so how can I fix this? <comment265076> Put OS X back on it. <comment265077> any other solutionï¼Ÿ I don't want os X again.
