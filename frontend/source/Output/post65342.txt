What are the differences between these two Apple TV models? <body> I have some Visa points which I am considering spending on an Apple TV.  According to my bank's website, Apple TV model they offer is codeMD199C/A/code. This seems to correspond to what Apple calls the emOrder Number/em (which is not the same as what Apple calls the emModel Number/em).  Using Mactracker, I found that the latest 3rd Generation Apple TV's emOrder Number/em is codeMD199LL/A/code, which is a bit different from what the bank's website is saying, although quite similar.  Does anyone know if the Apple TV with the emOrder Number/em codeMD199C/A/code is the latest, 3rd generation model? What is the difference between codeMD199C/A/code and codeMD199LL/A/code, if any?  Many thanks in advance.  <answer65343> Are you in Canada by any chance? The MD199iC/A/i code seems to be for the 3rd generation Apple TV in Canada, whereas the -iLL/A/i code is the part number in the US. I'm not aware of any differences between the two (other than the limitations on Canadian iTunes, such as more limited iCloud TV/Movie accessibility).  You can verify these numbers by adding the Apple TV to your cart in the US or Canadian online Apple Stores.  <comment76757> Aha! So *that's* what it means! I am indeed in Canada. Thanks! :)
