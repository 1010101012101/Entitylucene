How to format external SSD to boot Boot Camp Partition (BCP) backups from external SSD on USB-C MacBooks? <body> strongProblem:/strong I would like to attempt migration of a BCP WinClone 6 backup of an internal BCP on a USB-C MacBook Pro that will not boot from an external SSD drive as a troubleshooting step. I purchased the latest of Samsung's line of external SSD drives (T3) and formatted as documented below. However, the device Bytes/Sector (B/S) is different for USB-C MacBooks that are 4096 (4k) B/S. Apparently T3 is 512 B/S. How can I advance format T3 drive named "3571260102" so I can avoid the WinClone 6 warning below.  strongWinClone 6.0.3 Pro warning:/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7RWsc.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongT3 Configuration Steps:/strong  ul liErased the drive/li liMacOS Journaled/li liPartition Map to GUID/li liPartition into 2 drives/li liOne of them is sized to BCP size + 4gb safety margin formatted as MS-DOS (FAT) so that winclone can convert partition scheme/file system to NTFS which macOS can't do natively/li liUsed this configured partition titled "3571260102" as a troubleshooting bootable external drive/li /ul  strongmacOS Internal disk specs:/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yPCKX.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongmacOS Internal BCP "BOOTCAMP" disk specs:/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aLSbh.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongsamsung External T3 disk specs:/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wfLUt.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongsamsung External "3571260102" disk specs:/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0vWvl.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongSimilar Posts Online:/strong  ul liThe solution didn't work since the "3571260102" is WinClone prepped as MS-DOS (FAT) drive not HFS drive: Change drive &quot;block size&quot; to 4096/li liThe question here is pretty much exactly my question but no good answer was provided: http://www.tomshardware.com/answers/id-3291132/format-external-hard-drive-advance-format.html#lastAnswer/li liI want/need to perform reverse migration unless someone can recommend another external SSD: https://support.twocanoes.com/hc/en-us/articles/204433039-Image-Compatibility-between-older-Macs-and-USB-C-MacBooks-MacBook-Pros-FIXED-/li /ul  strongUnresolved Related Queries:/strong  ol li&quot;The bless tool was unable to set the current boot disk&quot; error in bootcamp macOS Sierra/li liAdvanced Troubleshooting Tips for macOS Sierra Boot Camp Partition (BCP)/li /ol  <answer289179> You can be assured that the SSD actually uses a 4KB block size. They often report a 512B block size for backwards compatibility. No drive has used a 512B block size in a long time.  <comment365365> Excuse me downvote people, but what I said is correct. <comment366394> I think there's a distinction between device/physical block size and virtual/logical/allocated block size. After restoring from winclone backup in spite of warning I notice clone has same logical 4k B/S as internal BCP. However the clone is still not bootable per se. See post on apple support. Is this because of 1) different device block sizes or 2) incorrect drivers or 3) naming/priority issue arising from system detecting duplicate drives???  https://discussions.apple.com/message/31960287#message31960287 <comment366395> I also called Samsung Support about this issue related to their external drives.https://discussions.apple.com/message/31960287#message31960287 Do you know if Samsung's internal drives have device/physical 4k blocks? <comment366430> A block size mismatch can affect performance, but it should still work regardless. All modern drives use 4KB physical block sizes, and what they report can be safely ignored, if whatever operating system you're using can safely handle the larger block size. All modern operating systems can handle it these days. Although, it's not a problem if the allocation size is larger than the physical block size, except that it can limit the amount of available storage space, if you have a lot of small files. <comment367579> This is not an "answer", it's a comment (which may indeed be correct, but doesn't answer the question).  Try sticking this answer right after "How to format external SSD to boot Boot Camp Partition (BCP) backups from external SSD on USB-C MacBooks?": "You can be assured that the SSD actually uses a 4KB block size."  Not helpful. <comment367582> What’s not helpful is answering a question, when the true question is something else. Note the XY Problem, which you can look up in your leisure. In this case, the real question was about the WinClone “block size issue” being encountered. The title here is incorrect.
