Can't switch to full screen apps or evoke Mission Control after sleep <body> Occasionally when I am working and put my MacBook to sleep, when I wake it up again, I am unable to switch to apps that I have had open in full screen. Similarly, if I open an app after sleep, switch to full screen mode and then command-tab to another application, I cannot return the full screen app.  Mission Control ceases to operate and gestures for switching (multi-finger swipes up to Expos√© and to the side for screen switching) also fail.  The only fix I have found is a full restart.  My setup is as follows:  ul liMacBook Pro 15" Retina Early 2013/li li2.7 GHz Intel Core i7/li li16 GB RAM/li liOS X Yosemite 10.10.4 (14E17e)/li liBuilt-in screen and external monitor/li liApple Magic Trackpad (issue also present with built-in trackpad)/li /ul  The issue presents itself sporadically and has been present for at least the last few Yosemite releases.  Any help would be very well received :-)  <answer195249> I get the same symptoms/failure.  The following Terminal command fixes it for me:  emkillall Dock/em  But before you do that, run emkillall -s Dock/em to make sure it's only going to directly kill the one "Dock" process. Dock will restart and then mission control is working again - for me anyway. You can verify that the restart happened by looking at the process ID of "Dock" after the restart. Hope this helps!  <comment221123> You are using an unreleased OS. You may need to wait for a fix. <comment221124> As mentioned **"... has been present for at least the last few Yosemite releases"**
