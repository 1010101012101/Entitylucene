Podcast App not downloading episodes to IPhone <body> for about the last week my podcast app on my iPhone 6+ has been preparing to download episodes but not downloading. Ian on iOS 8.3  This is serious I need to listen to Hansel minutes and history of revolutions!  I have tried shutdown app, clear download, logging out of iTunes etc.  Any suggestions  <answer182217> I had the same problem. I restarted the phone, cancelled the pending downloads and then started the downloads again and it seems to be working. Feel like I'm working with a Microsoft product :(  <comment216573> Interesting... Only thing I can think of is firewall blocking?? Try checking that... <comment216574> Unless every wifi hotspot I connect to has suddenly started blocking the same port.... <comment216578> Could you perhaps scrape together some logs and put them on pastebin? It would help greatly. Find logs by plugging device into computer. On mac logs are in: `~/Library/Logs` and on Windows: `AppData/Roaming/Apple Computer/Logs` <comment216579> Logs of what? Where would I get logs <comment216583> Ok, I'll try that. <comment216806> So simple, I kept on thinking I should try that.  The old solutions are still the best.
