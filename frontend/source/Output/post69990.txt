How to isolate the most disk-active process(es) in OS X? <body> I have some process(es) performing a lot of drive access from time to time, however I've hitherto been unable to isolate which process or processes are performing the access.  What shell command can I issue to isolate the most disk access intensive processes?  <answer70000> After fiddling with making my own solution via codefs_usage/code manipulation, I discovered the DTrace codeiotop/code script (codeman iotop/code).  This really seems to do the trick with regards to giving samples of filesystem activity at nice updated intervals and quickly allows one to isolate possibly misbehaving processes.  *strongNOTE/strong: you must run it with codesudo/code or as coderoot/code user.  For example:  precodesudo iotop -C 5   # Simply gives an update every 5 seconds in default output format without clearing screen. sudo iotop -CP 2  # Gives 2 second interval updates w/o clearing screen and I/O time based output. /code/pre  Options:  precodeiotop [-C] [-D|-o|-P] [-j|-Z] [-d device] [-f filename] [-m mount_point] [-t top] [interval [count]]     -C     don't clear the screen    -D     print delta times - elapsed, us    -j     print project ID    -o     print disk delta times, us    -P     print %I/O (disk delta times)    -Z     print zone ID    -d device           instance name to snoop (eg, dad0)    -f filename           full pathname of file to snoop    -m mount_point           mountpoint for filesystem to snoop    -t top print top number only /code/pre  <comment81304> The other very useful commands to focus in on what is happening are DTrace based rwsnoop and iosnoop <comment81322> Yes @TheTentacle, I've used `iosnoop` a lot, but generally found `fs_usage` to be faster.  Will have to play with `rwsnoop`, thanks.
