Is Apple's Core Image framework open source? <body> Is the source of Apple's Core Image framework open as other open source projects?  <answer145360> Nope it is not.   Only a few components in OSX are open source (Kernel, BSD inherited components, Grand Central Dispatch). Non of the Core Frameworks (Image, Storage, Animation, Graphics) are open source.   <comment171297> All open source components are listed on the page the OP links to <comment171299> Then why isn't lidispatch there ? <comment171301> What is lidispatch and if not there then a bug and should be reported to Apple <comment171302> It's for GCD. But it seems to be that Apache is behind it, not Apple : http://libdispatch.macosforge.org/ <comment171305> Is it part of OSX or just can be used? The list is of any open source OSX uses not what Apple has contributed to <comment171374> Well it seems it's used by OSX : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Central_Dispatch <comment171376> The more exact page is http://opensource.apple.com/release/os-x-1094/ I am now confused as to what the OP points to <comment171428> It seems to be they are only Open Source components not coming from Apple itself.
