How to config Mac Os X 10.12 with Server 5.2 to do basic IPFW, NAT and DHCP <body> How do configure it all. From what i manage to understand it's now PF that does that, but with all the info out there i'm not sure what is what.  I gathered so far that it can only be done command line for the PF and NAT and I guess that you can use the MAC Gui for the DHCP part?  <comment323889> I'm not interested in any firewall rules for now, just let it all pass....
