Quicksilver goes straight to text-entry mode <body> On my old-ish MacBook Pro (pre-unibody), Quicksilver has been misbehaving for quite some time. I fire the keyboard command to launch it (I like command-space, replacing Spotlight), and it comes up in text-entry mode rather than selection mode. I can hit escape and QS closes, but nothing I can do makes it come up prepared to navigate the objects it knows about.  It used to work just great. But it's a waste of cycles right now because it's completely unable to function as what it does.  I've re-launched it, I've deleted and re-installed it. Nothing seems to help.  <answer886> If I recall, there's a QS trigger called something like "Command Window In Text Mode."  Go to QuicksilverTriggersQuicksilver, I think, and look at what triggers are enabled.  Another possibility is that you have the "Spacebar Behavior" set to "Switch to text mode" in QuicksilverPreferencesCommand, and this is getting triggered when you use cmd-space.  It shouldn't matter, but it's worth a look.  <comment719> What do you mean with "deleted quicksilver" ? Did you just put it in the Trash ? <comment742> And emptied, yes. <comment743> For a reinstall to accomplish anything, you may need to delete some related quicksilver settings/preference files.  You can track them down by hand (~/Library/Application Support and ~/Library/Preferences are good places to look) or use an app (like AppZapper or anything here: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/470/how-do-i-uninstall-a-program-completely-on-a-mac)
