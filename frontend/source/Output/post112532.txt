Only some text messages are showing on my iPhone4 <body> All of a sudden my iPhone stopped showing my complete message history. When I go the "messages" a couple of recent ones are shown, at random, and scrolling down a screen or two shows messages dated from 2012 and 2011 !! I have turned the phone on and off, the issue is still there but the messages shown are different.  I haven't made any changes to settings apart from I have just turned iMessage off.  It doesn't seem to make any difference whether the messages are from iPhones or to iPhones.  I still seem to be receiving messages and can still send messages.
