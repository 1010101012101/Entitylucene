Paste tool for OSX <body> There is paste tool in Linux but have not found for OSX.  Its name was probably dpaste or something in Linux.  Assume you run codexxd -ps r328.raw |  head -n2430/code and you want to paste it to your friend.  It will be difficult to paste it to him.  Of course, I can store it into file but I want to get it to my clipboard.  How can you get paste thing to your clipboard?  <answer193219> strongman pbcopy/strong  precodepbcopy  takes  the  standard input and places it in the specified pasteboard. If no pasteboard is specified, the general pasteboard will be used by default. The input is placed in the pasteboard as plain  text data unless it begins with the Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) file header or the Rich Text Format (RTF) file header, in which case it is placed in the pasteboard as one of those data types /code/pre  So  precodexxd -ps r328.raw |  head -n2430 | pbcopy /code/pre  should place the output in the clipboard
