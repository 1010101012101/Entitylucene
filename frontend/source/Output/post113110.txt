Mavericks - strange behavior creating simlink in root directory <body> I want to create a simlink called code/home/code, that points to code/Users/code.  The command codesudo ln -s Users home/code (executed in /) should work; at least, I've demonstrated that the syntax is correct by creating a similar simlink in my home directory) but it's not working well in root.  I somehow managed to create an actual directory, that now can't be removed ("resource is busy").  Then I cd'ed into /home and tried to run  precode/home$  sudo mkdir chap mkdir: chap: Operation not supported /code/pre  Anyone understand what's going on?  Or should I keep my cotton-pickin' fingers out of /?  <answer113111> code/home/code is already used by codeautomount/code, see code/etc/auto_master/code and the various man pages for details.  <comment132757> Yikes. Thanks.  Hope I haven't broken anything.
