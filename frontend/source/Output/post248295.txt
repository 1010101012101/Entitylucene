How to change incorrect Wi-Fi password? <body> I went to a coffee shop that had Wi-Fi this morning and they gave me the network name and password. In the top-right corner of my desktop there is the Wi-Fi menu, and I selected it to "Turn Wi-Fi On" It searched for a few seconds and correctly found their network.  I then tried to connect to it, but botched/fat-fingered the password and pressed kbdEnter ‚èé/kbd by mistake. I then wasted about 20 mins trying to find a way to change the (bad) password that my Mac was using to authenticate with. I gave up and came home.  So I ask: strongHow do you change the password for a Wi-Fi network?/strong  <answer248298> There are two ways to do this...  h3Modify the Password in Keychain/h3  You can do this under emKeychain Access/em.  You will find all your saved Wi-Fi networks under the "System" keychain in the "Passwords" category.  Double clicking on the SSID (mine are redacted for security) will bring up a dialog box with the details for that particular Wi-Fi network.  From here, you can enter in a new password.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dEKQv.png" alt="enter image description here"  br  h3Delete the Network &amp; Rejoin/h3  You can also solve the issue by deleteing the network and rejoining it.  Simply go into your System Preferences  Network and select your Wi-Fi Adapter.  Click on the Advanced... button and you will be able to delete your Wi-Fi Network.  Just rejoin and enter in the good password.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/h4cRnm.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VjA2bm.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment307691> You have to **Apply** the change on the main Network window, after **OK**ing out of the Wi-Fi window. That might be the reason it's failing.
