Apple Magic mouse often loses connection <body> I have mac mini late 2011, up to date mac OS X and fully charged batteries. It still loses connection about 10 times per hour. It's really annoying  I've tried to remove Bluetooth.plist file, but it didn't help.  Is it solvable issue?  I use Wi Fi, and bluetooth apple keyboard.  <answer142027> More people have this annoyance. For me the solution was to use slightly fatter/bigger batteries (Duracell for example), or a piece of paper. When I very gently slammed my mouse on the table from a small height, the connection would drop. Probably due to a short disconnection/movement of the batteries.  <answer212589> The thing is, you can fix your mouse with just your fingers. strongSimply remove the back cover and bend it so that ends curve up on the Apple logo side/strong. Then, replace the cover. This is why buying a new mouse can fix the issue: Over time, the back cover starts to bend so that there is more room between it and the batteries.  <answer258642> The paper shim trick didn't work for me - it made the cover bulge enough to rub on the table top.  The cover bending suggestion sound risky.  So I combined the two as follows: Start with an 8 cm square of paper.  Fold it in half three times, giving a 4 cm by 2 cm pad with 8 thicknesses of paper.  Remove the cover and position it on top of the paper pad, centered, so it overhangs the pad by 2 cm on each end.  Push down on the two ends until they touch the table.  Replace the cover (without any paper shim) and test.  If necessary, repeat with a pad that has 10 or 12 layers of paper.  <comment167348> I've used piece of paper, but it changed anything significantly. This is very sad. <comment167358> Putting my mini up on a 1" platform above the table solved *most* of the problem for me. Mouse still goes out sometimes when (metal) keyboard gets too close to the left side of the mini. Likely its an antenna problem, as this sort of "aluminum foil on the rabbit ears" approach *works*. <comment167363> It helps to swab the mouse contacts with a wet Q-Tip once in a while. Also periodically dampen battery ends and rub dry with cloth. It doesn't take much dirt at all to interrupt a 3 volt connection. <comment264002> This worked for me as the cardboard answer stopped the batteries making the circuit. <comment290348> Two of my colleagues have this problem, but only at the office. At home, no problem at all. They still don't know what's causing it: WiFi or bluetooth or something else. Both use the Magic Mouse with recent MacBooks.
