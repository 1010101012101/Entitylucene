Vertical Sync on MBP <body> On PCs you could easily configure the Vertical Sync setting from NVidia control panel, how can you enable/disable vertical sync in OS X?  <answer81220> In OSX, Veritical Sync is called Beam Sync  Running the command codesudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.windowserver Compositor -dict deferredUpdates 0/code should do it for you, but you may need to reboot. Replace the 0 with 1 to re-enable.  You should also be able to do this by downloading this prefpane and looking under "System". Another way is to use Quartz Debug to disable it, but it seems like that has become harder to run on Lion &amp; ML.  <comment93633> What are you trying to accomplish? <comment125006> I love Mac, but life would be so much easier if they'd use standard terminology. Reminds me of when IBM insisted on calling pixels "PELs."
