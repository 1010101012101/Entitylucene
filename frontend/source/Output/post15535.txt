How do I restore a temp file I worked on in Quickoffice on my iPad 2? <body> The first thing I did on my new iPad was finish writing a new monologue for my new play in Quickoffice from a MobileMe doc. When I finish I could swear I saved it but when I printed it out - NONE of my brilliant changes were saved in it.  I've been going crazy trying to auto-restore the temp file the manual says it creates as you write. Nowhere can I find any directions for how to access this feature.  Can anyone help?
