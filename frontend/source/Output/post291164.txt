How can I keep VirtualBox .vbox custom file icon from reverting to the VB default? <body> I use VirtualBox for VMs. If I give one of my em.vbox/em VM files a custom icon via codeGet Info &gt; paste the new icon/code, VirtualBox reverts it to the default light blue cube after on the second open.  That is, I apply a custom icon, open the VM, shut down the VM, and open the VM, and while it's opening for the second time the icon reverts.  This is frustrating because I keep multiple VMs in my Dock, and they all look the same.  I've filed a ticket at virtualbox.org, but does anyone have a workaround or hack?
