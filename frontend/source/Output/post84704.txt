How to access my .ssh folder for Transmit or Cyberduck? <body> I"m trying to connect to my linux server which uses public key authentication. By default, the .ssh folder is hidden on my mac (which I can access via the terminal). However, when I try to setup a connection using either Cyberduck or Transmit, the Finder popup that opens does not show the .ssh folder.  How do I select the key ?  One alternative would be to copy the key to a directory outside the .ssh folder. But i'd definitely like to hear other solutions. How are you doing it ?  <answer84715> You need to tell Transmit or Cyberduck to show your hidden folders. The code./code in the folder name is part of why it is hidden.   In Transmit, there should be a menu option in codeView/code - codeShow Invisible Files/code. Cyberduck may have a similar menu option in the View menu, but it may say codeShow Hidden Files/code.   This will let you see it in the application. If you need to see it in an Open file dialog, press kbdcmd/kbd + kbdShift/kbd + kbdG/kbd` while the open dialog window is open. This will drop down a "Go to the folder" screen. Type in the hidden folder path you wish to navigate to and that folder will now display in the open dialog window.  <answer84733> In the find file window, press Command-Shift-G.  It'll ask you what folder to navigate to.  Enter "~/.ssh" and press return.  <answer116387> Open the Terminal window on your MAC:( by default you will be in Home dir.)  type : $ ls -la  This will list all the files &amp; folder including hidden folders.  <comment97590> Transmit will honor your .ssh/config, and if you have a .ssh/id_rsa, it'll use that automatically.  Just connect like you normally would, but leave the password blank. <comment97799> Yes ! Worked !!
