Where does a pkg installer install things? <body> I created a *.pkg installer for a command line tool following this guide: Packaging a daemon for OS X.  After running the installer, and selecting "Install for all users", I can't find where my installed files are.  The installer says the setup will take 57.9MB and the copying section takes quite some seconds, so I assume files are actually being copied and there is not an issue with my installer.  Where did those files go? A codefind //code didn't reveal anything.  <answer174695> You can check it from Terminal. Navigate to the folder where You have Your codepkg/code file. Enter this:  precodemkdir Foo cd Foo xar -xf ../NAME_OF_YOUR.pkg lsbom Bom /code/pre  This will list files/paths which are included in this codepkg/code.  <comment205723> What is `Bom` supposed to be?      $ lsbom Bom     can't open Bom: No such file or directory     **** Can't open Bom. <comment205724> Is is a flat package? (it's not if You can `cd` into Your `.pkg`) <comment205726> I can't cd to the pkg. `file` says: xar archive - version 1. <comment205727> Can You list the contents of `Foo` dir after extracting Your `pkg` (`ls -la`)? <comment205728> I can. I see Distribution, Resources and my cli.pkg. <comment205730> Can you check what You get after `pkgutil --expand NAME_OF_YOUR.pkg DEST_DIR`? This should unpack Your `pkg` file to `DEST_DIR`. <comment205731> I get the exact same results as above: Distribution, Resources and my cli.pkg. <comment205734> What about `pkgutil list`? I can't remember if that works. <comment205737> `--list` doesn't seems to exists. I tried `--files` and `--lsbom` but I get `No receipt for 'resin-cli-setup.pkg' found at '/'.` for both of them. <comment205743> Turns out it was extracted directly to `/`. I specified a `customLocation` property in `choices` to fix it.
