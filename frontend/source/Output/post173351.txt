How to import .eml files into Mail? <body> I'm using codereadpst/code to extract emails from a bunch of old outlook code.PST/code files.  It does a great job of pulling out all the emails code.EML/code files, with attachments included.  But how do I bring these into Apple Mail?  Any of the "Import..." options create a separate mailbox for strongeach message./strong  I want to be able to import groups of messages into a particular mailbox.  (I know that codereadpst/code can also generate codembox/code files, which Apple Mail handles OK, but slowly; but this is not what I want to do.)  <answer173362> If you put the exported e-mails (*.eml files) into a folder structure, then just select the outer folder as the import folder.  The test import I just did is like below:  ol liSelect "Apple Mail" as the "Import data from":/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mFWIi.png" alt="enter image description here"   ol start="2" liSelect the outer (root) folder of the e-mails to import:/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yRevN.png" alt="enter image description here"  ol start="3" liConfirm the selection: /li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/F00dy.png" alt="enter image description here"  ol start="4" liThe imported .eml e-mails is now in an 'import' mailbox (only one mailbox) with the same folder structure as the folder the import came from:/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jwklO.png" alt="enter image description here"  Now you can move all or selected e-mails from the import folder to the mailbox of choice. When all e-mails has been moved, just delete the 'import' mailbox.  <comment203900> I've heard some folks have had success exporting .eml files in .mbox format with Microsoft Outlook|Office 2011. <comment203908> eml or emlx files <comment203914> Have you tried just to drag and drop the .eml files into Apple Mail ?? <comment203915> @ReneLarsen yes, that was the first thing I tried. <comment203922> Thanks, that works ... but did you notice that nearly all messages have an unopenable attachment called "Mail Atttachment"? Or is that just me? Might be because of `readpst` <comment203923> I don't have any problems with the attachments - but I also only did a small test, where I exported some e-mails (drag'n'drop) - and the imported them again - two of them had attachments. <comment281324> I wish I had found this answer before all my failed attempts to convert a folder full of .eml files to one .mbox file. Since the files were exported from Windows Vista Mail, it never occurred to me that "Apple Mail" was the option I should select. <comment295553> For some reason, when I try this, each .eml gets its own folder, but both are at the same level in the same folder in the filesystem. <comment349414> @AdamGrant Me, too, unfotunately. Did you figure out a way to avoid this? <comment370596> @mdomino, @AdamGrant: If you rename the parent directory to have a `.mbox` extension (so, for example, the structure ends up looking like: `import.mbox/message1.eml`, `import.mbox/message2.eml`), then the current version of Mail seems to properly import all of the messages into a single folder (rather than each EML file getting its own folder).
