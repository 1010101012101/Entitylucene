How to stop a iCloud Drive file or folder download in OS X? <body> I activated iCloud Drive on my MacBook with OS X, and some folders showed as not downloaded yet. strongSo I clicked on the arrow next to the folder name to download the whole folder from the iCloud to my local MacBook/strong.  I realized that my current internet connection (I am at my friends place currently) is too slow and therefore blocks all the traffic.      How can I stop an active download from the iCloud Drive to my local   Mac under OS X?   <answer250443> This great mac utility, TripMode, should be able to do the trick.   It should be able to block all internet traffic and then you can selectively allow apps through individually. Especially useful with phone personal hotspot to conserve on the data used.  <comment310987> Why what does it do? An answer should work without the link
