Permanent spots on retina display <body> I own a mac book pro 15'' for 3 years. The last year on retina display appeared some permanent spots. These spots are growing as the time past.   I asked apple service and they told me that I have to change a membrane that covers the retina display. Does anyone know if this is safe?
