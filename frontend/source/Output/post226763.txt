Mail Failing to Send SMTP Password <body> Very frustrating issue started yesterday with Mail suddenly deciding that it's not going to send my SMTP password to my outgoing mail server. Nothing else has changed, it just suddenly isn't working. I operate the mail server myself, so I know that nothing has changed on the server end either, and that the settings are all exactly right; I have in fact been sending messages just fine for the past few months.  I'm not sure if it's related, but under my SMTP server list the "Automatically detect and maintain account settings" checkbox is enabled and greyed out, making it impossible to disable it. If I manually edit Accounts.plist to set codeConfigureDynamically/code to codefalse/code then Mail just overwrites it codetrue/code again.  I really have no idea what's happening, as Mail seems to be simply failing to send my SMTP password, instead sending an asterisk (abort). Here's a sample of the SMTP connection log immediately after setting a new SMTP password and trying to send:  precodeINITIATING CONNECTION Feb 09 08:31:03.579 host:mail.example.org -- port:587 -- socket:0x0 -- thread:0x7ff7fe690170  CONNECTED Feb 09 08:31:03.703 [kCFStreamSocketSecurityLevelNone] -- host:mail.example.org -- port:587 -- socket:0x7ff7fdf17f20 -- thread:0x7ff7fe690170  READ Feb 09 08:31:03.881 [kCFStreamSocketSecurityLevelNone] -- host:mail.example.org -- port:587 -- socket:0x7ff7fdf17f20 -- thread:0x7ff7fe690170 220 mail.example.org ESMTP  WROTE Feb 09 08:31:03.927 [kCFStreamSocketSecurityLevelNone] -- host:mail.example.org -- port:587 -- socket:0x7ff7fdf17f20 -- thread:0x7ff7fe690170 EHLO [192.168.0.14]  READ Feb 09 08:31:04.033 [kCFStreamSocketSecurityLevelNone] -- host:mail.example.org -- port:587 -- socket:0x7ff7fdf17f20 -- thread:0x7ff7fe690170 250-mail.example.org 250-PIPELINING 250-SIZE 10240000 250-ETRN 250-STARTTLS 250-ENHANCEDSTATUSCODES 250-8BITMIME 250 DSN  WROTE Feb 09 08:31:04.033 [kCFStreamSocketSecurityLevelNone] -- host:mail.example.org -- port:587 -- socket:0x7ff7fdf17f20 -- thread:0x7ff7fe690170 STARTTLS  READ Feb 09 08:31:04.160 [kCFStreamSocketSecurityLevelNone] -- host:mail.example.org -- port:587 -- socket:0x7ff7fdf17f20 -- thread:0x7ff7fe690170 220 2.0.0 Ready to start TLS  WROTE Feb 09 08:31:04.263 [kCFStreamSocketSecurityLevelTLSv1_0] -- host:mail.example.org -- port:587 -- socket:0x7ff7fdf17f20 -- thread:0x7ff7fe690170 EHLO [192.168.0.14]  READ Feb 09 08:31:04.504 [kCFStreamSocketSecurityLevelTLSv1_0] -- host:mail.example.org -- port:587 -- socket:0x7ff7fdf17f20 -- thread:0x7ff7fe690170 250-mail.example.org 250-PIPELINING 250-SIZE 10240000 250-ETRN 250-AUTH PLAIN LOGIN 250-AUTH=PLAIN LOGIN 250-ENHANCEDSTATUSCODES 250-8BITMIME 250 DSN  WROTE Feb 09 08:31:04.569 [kCFStreamSocketSecurityLevelTLSv1_0] -- host:mail.example.org -- port:587 -- socket:0x7ff7fdf17f20 -- thread:0x7ff7fe690170 AUTH LOGIN  READ Feb 09 08:31:04.670 [kCFStreamSocketSecurityLevelTLSv1_0] -- host:mail.example.org -- port:587 -- socket:0x7ff7fdf17f20 -- thread:0x7ff7fe690170 334 VXNlcm5hbWU6  WROTE Feb 09 08:31:04.670 [kCFStreamSocketSecurityLevelTLSv1_0] -- host:mail.example.org -- port:587 -- socket:0x7ff7fdf17f20 -- thread:0x7ff7fe690170 dXNlcm5hbWVAZXhhbXBsZS5vcmc=  READ Feb 09 08:31:04.768 [kCFStreamSocketSecurityLevelTLSv1_0] -- host:mail.example.org -- port:587 -- socket:0x7ff7fdf17f20 -- thread:0x7ff7fe690170 334 UGFzc3dvcmQ6  WROTE Feb 09 08:31:04.786 [kCFStreamSocketSecurityLevelTLSv1_0] -- host:mail.example.org -- port:587 -- socket:0x7ff7fdf17f20 -- thread:0x7ff7fe690170 *  READ Feb 09 08:31:04.887 [kCFStreamSocketSecurityLevelTLSv1_0] -- host:mail.example.org -- port:587 -- socket:0x7ff7fdf17f20 -- thread:0x7ff7fe690170 501 5.7.0 Authentication aborted  WROTE Feb 09 08:31:04.887 [kCFStreamSocketSecurityLevelTLSv1_0] -- host:mail.example.org -- port:587 -- socket:0x7ff7fdf17f20 -- thread:0x7ff7fe690170 QUIT /code/pre  (I replaced the domain with codeexample.org/code)  As you can Mail sends an e-mail address when asked, but when asked to send a password it sends code*/code, which causes the mail server to abort authentication, i.e- it's not even sending a password.  Why isn't Mail sending my password, and what can I do to fix it? I've already checked under Keychain Access and the correct password is definitely being saved for my SMTP server, so I have no idea what's going on.  Just wanted to add as well, but I've tried manually connecting to the SMTP server using codeopenssl s_client -starttls smtp -connect mail.example.org:587/code and manually entering commands, including the codeAUTH LOGIN/code steps with my base64 encoded password, and authentication is successful, the fault appears to be only with Mail, so the status quo for OS X Mail in my experience ;)  <answer226765> So it seems I may have just stumbled upon the cause myself; in addition to my active e-mail accounts, I also had two disabled IMAP accounts (no SMTP details) that I've been migrating from recently. It turns out that while these were listed in Mail they were not listed under Internet Accounts, contrary to what Mail would say when I tried to remove them.  Closing Mail, opening Accounts.plist and manually removing the inactive accounts before saving and relaunching Mail appears to have corrected the issue.  I'm not certain whether to mark this as the answer or to delete this question as I'm not sure how useful this is likely to be; I suppose someone else may eventually find an SMTP server failing after somehow getting inactive IMAP accounts "stuck" in this way; I'm going to report it to Apple anyway as I can't even begin to imagine why this should have caused Mail to stop sending an SMTP password.  Solving this issue also allows me to now enable or disable the "Automatically detect and maintain account settings" option, not sure what to make of that but it's a damned menace so it's getting turned off.  <comment324037> Can you point to the full path of `Accounts.plist`? <comment324038> I found it at `~/Library/Mail/V2/MailData/Accounts.plist` .
