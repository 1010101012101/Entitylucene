Most-efficient way to copy iPhoto events between computers? <body> I experienced a hard-drive crash recently.  While I was able to recover most of the lost photographs from Mozy, some where lost.  Fortunately, the missing photographs are located on another machine.  ** edit **  ul liComputer A: MacBook Pro with Mavericks and iPhoto 9.5.1/li liComputer B: Mac Mini with Snow Leopard and iPhoto 9.2.3/li /ul  I want to preserve the existing photos, faces, and events on computer B (the recovered items), but copy the photos, faces, and events from computer A (the missing items).  What is the most-efficient way to do this?  <answer134813> To move the iPhoto Library folder or package to a new location:  ol liQuit iPhoto if open./li liOpen your Pictures folder and select the iPhoto Library./li liDrag the iPhoto Library folder or package to its new location./li /ol  If you are using iPhoto ’08 or later, you can double-click the iPhoto Library icon in its new location to open iPhoto. iPhoto will remember this new location in the future.  If you are using iPhoto ’06 or earlier, you will need to follow these steps to tell iPhoto where the Library is now located:  ol liHold down the Option key on the keyboard and open iPhoto. /li liKeep the Option key held down until you are prompted to create or choose an iPhoto Library./li liClick Choose Library./li liLocate and select the iPhoto Library in its new location./li /ol  <answer135427> The most efficient way to accomplish this would be to emmerge libraries/em. Unfortunately, this is not included as a feature within iPhoto, but can be accomplished using an excellent program, strongiPhoto Library Manager/strong. It's compatible with all versions of iPhoto v8.1.2 or later.   ul liYour iPhoto Library, by default, is located at: code~/Pictures/iPhoto Library/code/li liEither place the iPhoto Library of Computer A on an HFS+ formatted external HDD, or use Target Disk Mode to mount Computer A's HDD as an external drive on computer B. I recommend the former method. /li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FdUFK.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  ul liChoose Source Library: path to A's library on external HDD/li liChoose Destination Library: path to B's library./li liSee (3) and (4) for Duplicate Handling and Additional Options, then merge the libraries. /li /ul  <comment159684> I updated my question. <comment159687> Could you explain a little more ? I'm afraid I don't totally get your point <comment159689> There are events on computer A that aren't on computer B--they were lost in the crash.  I'd like to copy these events from A to B.  It is easy to *just* copy the photos, but I would like to preserve the meta-data associated with the event and the photographs (e.g. faces). <comment159690> maybe this : http://soniq.org/macsoftware/15749/iphoto-export-all-events-to-folders#axzz34Qt1Vix8 <comment160125> @craig Is there a typo in the question?  It reads "I want to preserve... on computer B, but copy... from computer B".  I was expecting one of those to be "computer A".  Can you clarify? <comment160210> @Ashley: You are right: computer A is the source.  I've corrected the question.
