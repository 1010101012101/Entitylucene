Is there an app to ping IP's periodically to check latency? <body> I'm sure I came across a really nice app that would ping a list of sites or IP addresses every x mins/hours and send alerts when it could not ping.  But I can't find the app back, anyone know of any good ones?  <answer28354> I'm not sure if this sends alerts, but it can monitor up to 250 IP addresses at whatever interval you like.  It can display the host, status (as green/yellow/red) and ping time.    On the app store for $1.99: http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ping/id412751654?mt=12  <answer28376> How about a web service that will do this for you?  Check out host-tracker.com.  It will ping an IP address (or http-get or traceroute) for you from a collection of sensor sites.  It looks like it will email you error notifications.  I haven't used the site, so can't speak to how well it works.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KVoI8.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment33030> Not really... I need something to check that my local internet connectivity is working. <comment33043> Yeah this is the functionality I was after... but it's not the app I remember. I found another app call "sntop" which does what I want too but not in a nice GUI as I remember.
