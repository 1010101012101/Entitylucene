Are the mid-2012 Macbook Air compatible with older MagSafe adapters? <body> Will the mid-2012 Macbook Air models be compatible with the MagSafe power supply of the previous generations?  <answer53749> Electrically yes, physically not without an adapter.  Only the physical layout of the pins and metal end that connects to the Air is different. However, with the MagSafe to MagSafe 2 Adaptor ($10) lets any original sized MagSafe adapter slim down to work with the new thinner Mac-side of the MagSafe 2 connection.  <comment61511> If I would want to be pedantic, I would ask how do you know what the pins are, that the $10 adapter is, indeed, just wires. But, obviously, a $10 adapter from Apple that small can't really contain any power circuitry.
