How to auto-indent code in Coda 2? <body> I just installed Coda 2 but can't find how to auto-format / auto-indent the code. In Dreamweaver there is this useful function called "Apply Source Formatting" which basically removes white space and auto indents the code, I can't find how to do this in Coda.br The only thing I found is a plugin called "White Out", but it doesn't seem to work.br Thanks!  <answer110591> Select all text or code of your document and press strongCMD + Shift + F12/strong  <comment287237> This doesn't work.
