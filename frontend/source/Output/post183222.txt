I'm not certain OS X can handle FAT over 32GB, but I can't find a hard reference for that. <comment248050> It's possibly a badly formatted card. I've seen tons of examples of poor-quality cheap cards coming improperly formatted. Try using Disk Utility to repartition and reinitialize the SD card. If the card isn't a name brand (and even if it is - counterfeiters love to imitate name brands) I'd highly suggest you thoroughly test the card by filling it all the way up with data and then trying to access some of the first few files you wrote before trusting the card.
