How do I cleanly install macOS on a Fusion Drive? <body> I have an iMac with a Fusion Drive that seems to have become unfused. To fix this, I want to cleanly reinstall macOS Sierra.  Here's my partition map:  precode$ diskutil list /dev/disk0 (internal, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *121.3 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:          Apple_CoreStorage Macintosh HD            121.0 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Boot OS X               134.2 MB   disk0s3  /dev/disk1 (internal, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *2.0 TB     disk1    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk1s1    2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            2.0 TB     disk1s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk1s3 /code/pre  ol liCan I delete all these partitions, including EFI? And how â€” using the diskutil command line or the graphical Disk Utility?/li liAm I correct in assuming that no special steps are needed to delete a Core Storage logical volume group, that deleting its underlying phsyical volume (disk0s2 above) does the trick?/li liOnce I've deleted all partitions, does the macOS installer offer to create a Fusion Drive when presented with a blank pair of disks? Or should I manually create a Fusion Drive before running the macOS installer?/li liDoes the macOS installer automatically recreate the EFI and recovery partitions in addition to Macintosh HD? Or do I need to create them manually before running the installer? If it's the latter, how?/li /ol  I'm installing Sierra, 10.12.1.
