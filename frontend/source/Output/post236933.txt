Multi monitor dock solution <body> I'm looking for a decent multi monitor (currently 2) solution for Mac OS X. As I am constantly switching between Windows (work) and Mac (home/side projects) I am badly missing something like DisplayFusion on the Mac.  Currently running El Capitan I am really interested in a solution that provides  ul liSeparated Dock on every monitor/li liDock not auto-hiding depending on which monitor I'm working/li liDock Icons showing up only on the monitor where the app is currently running / located/li /ul  Especially (pain) point number 3 is crucial. I don't want to start any discussion of what "is better" over the other. But for me in direct comparison using multiple monitors on a Mac is really no fun directly compared to the Windows experience.  Any tools that can help? Trying to find a decent solution for ages already.
