Create new partition from brand new MacBook Air <body> I just purchased a macbook air, and when opening Disk Utility, I see the following:  251 GB Apple  - Macintosh HD  I want to have a 10GB partition besides the current one, which will have the format: Mac OS Extended (Case-sensitive).  I am wondering if I can do that just from the Disk Utility (by clicking on the '+' sign), or that will delete the current partition?  <answer127570> Yes, simply click strong+/strong to add a new partition. It will take space from the end of the current partition and add a new one to the end. No data will be destroyed â€” you can confirm this in the confirmation pane once you click Apply.
