Has iOS Always had Secure Boot? <body> In Apple's recent iOS Security paper here http://images.apple.com/ipad/business/docs/iOS_Security_May12.pdf  They speak about the Secure Boot Chain, my question is has iPhones/iPods/iPads always had this feature?     "Secure Boot Chain Each step of the boot-up process contains   components that are cryptographically  signed by Apple to ensure   integrity, and proceeds only after verifying the chain of  trust. This   includes the bootloaders, kernel, kernel extensions, and baseband   firmware"   <answer60940> The strongSecure Boot Chain/strong is a succession of steps designed to check and verify the integrity of the iOS. As it ensures too that the iOS runs only on validated Apple device, I'd say that it has been like this since the beginning.
