yosemite on yosemite in virtualbox <body> I would like to run yosemite in virtualbox on yosemite. I've tried many step-by-step guides, without success. While there is a lot of descriptions on how to install hacked OS X on windows, I want to stay legal and use unmodified OS X, only in a virtualized manner.  Tried:  ul licreate ISO from /Applications/Install OS X Yosemite.app (at least two different ways) and supply it as Bootable CD and/li licreate bootable USB and attached it as virtual disk/li /ul  but boot always get stuck with codeMissing Bluetooth Controller Transport!/code message. There is a youtube video on how to eliminate this issue, but I'm not sure on how to set boot flags in virtualbox (tried: codeVBoxManage setextradata osx "VBoxInternal2/EfiBootArgs"  "-s"/code, then boot displayed bash prompt for a second, but couldn't type anything there). I've also tried to set cpuidset (was suggested in one article) via codeVBoxManage modifyvm osx --cpuidset 1 000206a7 02100800 1fbae3bf bfebfbff/code, but that made no difference, neither.  I need all this hassle, because I want to create a build environment setup script, therefore  ol liI should be able to throw away my os state at any time and start fresh./li /ol  Also  ol liI don't want to install every sort of dev tools, because I want to keep clean my machine for daily use and/li liI want to be able to have multiple dev environments with different setups (for work and for my sandbox projects)/li /ol  I'm also new to mac community. I appreciate any help. Thank you in advance.  <answer187975> Did you make sure you've stopped the virtual machine before you ran the command codeVBoxManage modifyvm osx --cpuidset 1 000206a7 02100800 1fbae3bf bfebfbff/code?  I wrote an detailed guide for virtualized Yosemite some time ago and ran into the same issue which I could fix with said command.   <answer236266> Download codeInstall OS X Yosemite/code from the Mac App Store. Use codeiesd/code to create a bootable codedmg/code:  precodeiesd -i "/Applications/Install OS X Yosemite.app"/ -o yosemite.dmg -t BaseSystem /code/pre  Install VirtualBox for Mac Hosts  Create a new VirtualBox guest. Choose codeType: [Mac OS X]/code and codeVersion: [Mac OS X (64-bit)]/code. Don't choose a specific OS version.   After you create the guest, choose it and click codeSettings/code-codeSystem/code-codeMotherboard/code-codeChipset/code and choose codePIIX3/code. If you leave the default codeICH9/code set, the system will never boot. You'll just see a black screen in your guest window.    Choose the codeyosemite.dmg/code you created earlier for your guest's optical disk.  Start your guest.  You'll see a wall of text and eventually the OS X Installer screen.  Use disk utility to partition your disk into a single partition. Disk Utility will have proper defaults.  Exit disk utility and run the installer.  You'll find some steps like these below in other places, but they didn't work for me. codeiesd/code worked.  precode #!/bin/bash     # Mount the installer image    hdiutil attach /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ Yosemite.app/Contents/SharedSupport/InstallESD.dmg -noverify -nobrowse -mountpoint /Volumes/install_app     # Convert the boot image to a sparse bundle    hdiutil convert /Volumes/install_app/BaseSystem.dmg -format UDSP -o /tmp/Yosemite     # Increase the sparse bundle capacity to accommodate the packages    hdiutil resize -size 8g /tmp/Yosemite.sparseimage     # Mount the sparse bundle for package addition    hdiutil attach /tmp/Yosemite.sparseimage -noverify -nobrowse -mountpoint /Volumes/install_build     # Remove Package link and replace with actual files    rm /Volumes/install_build/System/Installation/Packages    cp -rp /Volumes/install_app/Packages /Volumes/install_build/System/Installation/     # Copy Base System    cp -rp /Volumes/install_app/BaseSystem.dmg /Volumes/install_build/    cp -rp /Volumes/install_app/BaseSystem.chunklist /Volumes/install_build/     # Unmount the installer image    hdiutil detach /Volumes/install_app     # Unmount the sparse bundle    hdiutil detach /Volumes/install_build     # Resize the partition in the sparse bundle to remove any free space    hdiutil resize -size `hdiutil resize -limits /tmp/Yosemite.sparseimage | tail -n 1 | awk '{ print $1 }'`b /tmp/Yosemite.sparseimage     # Convert the sparse bundle to ISO/CD master    hdiutil convert /tmp/Yosemite.sparseimage -format UDTO -o /tmp/Yosemite     # Remove the sparse bundle    rm /tmp/Yosemite.sparseimage     # Rename the ISO and move it to the desktop    mv /tmp/Yosemite.cdr ~/Desktop/Yosemite.iso  /code/pre  <comment222355> Do yourself a favor and use VMware Fusion to run OS X in a virtual machine.  It's not free like VirtualBox however it's much better then VirtualBox.  Also installing OS X in a VM under VMware Fusion is straight forward compared to VirtualBox. <comment222378> VMware works like a charm :) thanks. <comment222379> Thank you, this is one of the step-by-step guide I followed, but I couldn't make it work :( When I get some time, I'll try one more time. (BTW, it was a nice post). <comment222380> Thanks! Let me know if it still doesn't work. I'll do my best to help you out. Make sure to reply in here, since I don't really get notified on the Gist comments if I don't check manually. <comment222381> Ok. Thanks again.
