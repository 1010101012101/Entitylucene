When I search the help system, I never get any response <body> My iMac is generally fast, but when I search the help system, I never get any response.   The help system works fine if I simply navigate it, but search never returns anything.   Any suggestions would be appreciated.  <answer221601> I would download the demo of TinkerTool System and run the “Repair Help Viewer” routine.  http://www.bresink.com/osx/TinkerToolSys4.html  strongMenu ▹ User/strong – then the strongRepair/strong panel – then strongRepair “Help Viewer”/strong  See the online documentation:  http://www.bresink.com/osx/300644207/Docs-en/pgs/0220-User.html  Search for the literal text:  Repair “Help Viewer”  -ccs
