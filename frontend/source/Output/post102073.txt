Does installing Command Line Tools for Xcode also install Git? <body> When I run codegit --version/code I get codegit version 1.7.12.4 (Apple Git-37)/code, and it seems to be located at code/usr/bin/git/code. I don't remember installing Git, but I emdid/em install Command Line Tools for Xcode in order to install Homebrew. Not a full Xcode install â€” just the command line tools.  I'm trying to figure out how best to update to a newer Git version, and determining how it was originally installed would be helpful. I emthink/em it came with the command line tools installation, but I'm not 100%.  <answer102081> Yes, the Command Line Tools package does include code/usr/bin/git/code. You can see what files are included in an installer by pressing command-I:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OSwK3.png" alt=""  As of 10.8, OS X does not come with git preinstalled.  <comment120240> FYI, if you're looking to install a newer git, I would recommend use Homebrew with `brew upgrade` and/or `brew install git` <comment120241> @DavidPearce The more I look into this, the more I think that's the best answer too.
