Maps has my address wrong when home <body> Maps is not getting my address right. It has the street right but when home it says I'm not. I have tried everything.  <answer171819> Assuming iOS 8.1.3, in the Maps app, touch on the information icon in the lower-right corner, then touch the "Report a Problem" button on the next screen.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FcdMb.png" alt="enter image description here"
