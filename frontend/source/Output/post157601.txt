Transferring iPhoto to iCloud drive <body> I have been running out of hard drive space on my older MacBook Air.  I decided to free up the 91gb of space that is my iPhoto.  (I believe) I moved iPhoto in relatively easy fashion.  I drug it from it's old location to iCloud drive in Finder.  (Surprisingly) in an instant it transferred.    This is where I need help ...   I now have LESS space available on my hard drive than before I started.  I expected to have the 91gb that my iPhoto was occupying.  I don't, in fact have less space than before I started.  I'm sure the explanation to this is simple to many ... but certainly not to me. Can you help please?  <comment185349> When you drag between drives (or in this case, between a local drive and what is essentially a network share) it copies files, it does not move them. So you now have two copies of the iPhoto library on your hard drive, since a local copy of the files that are in iCloud Drive is stored.
