How to uninstall Git? <body> Anyone know how to uninstall Git?  I would like to uninstall Git using the Uninstall.sh file that came in the git-2.0.1 install bundle.  I am unable to find the Uninstall.sh file using Terminal. When I enter "git --version" in the command line, I get "Illegal Instruction" in my Terminal window. (See image below).   I would like to uninstall Git and then reinstall it. Perhaps the Git download was corrupt. Any ideas? I am running Mac OS 10.6.8.

I was able to uninstall Git using your string. But, I tried to reinstall it again and I'm still getting "Illegal Instruction" in my Terminal window when I type "git --version". Any ideas why that is happening? Someone said it might be a bad Git download so I downloaded again from Git-scm.com (via SourceForge.net) Again...THX! <comment172652> I guess re-install is a better solution, as some software installation may use Git.
