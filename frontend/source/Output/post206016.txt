how do I backup apps stored on the phone? <body> I've recently made iTune backups (not iCloud) of my iDevices and iTunes copied the apps to the local drive. I tried doing the same thing on my wife's iPhone but the apps arent' getting copied. Maybe I'm doing something wrong. But I'm only pressing backup on iTunes.  Thanks! :)  <answer206020> Go to codeFile -&gt; Devices -&gt; Transfer Purchases from "iPhone"/code. If that doesn't do it, authorize first with codeStore -&gt; Authorize This Computer.../code with the same Apple ID you used to purchase those apps, and then try again.  <comment248410> hello. I just tried your suggestion (using iOS9 and iTunes 12.3) on 2 MacBooks and it didn't work! :/
