How do I route internet through local PPP connection I have on PTY terminal? <body> I'm doing this hack job where I have routed a cell phone's GPRS modem over to a local PTY. The proprietary debug software actually routes the modem over TCP, I then use socat to route it to a PTY (planning on using PPPD, which needs a serial terminal to connect to AFAIK).  I plan on establishing a PPP connection over that PTY (maybe PPPD, or any other solutions?)  However, even if I establish this PPP connection, I have no idea how to make it effective over the OS (so it doesn't use the WIFI or any other configured options such as Ethernet). This is the part I really have no idea how to setup. I took a look at possibly setting something up in System Preferences â†’ Network but the remotely closest options are Bluetooth DUN, PPPoE, USB modem, but I don't know what I am doing at this point. I'll even have to learn to make this successful PPP connection. We will see.  Backgroundbr OS X Mavericksbr T=Mobile Sidekick II phone with Enfora Enabler-II G modem  <answer120738> pppd automatically registers the PPP network interface upon successful registration!  From my experience performing this on OSX Mavericks 10.9.1, the /etc/ppp directory starts out empty.   h1Populate /etc/ppp/h1  I had to populate it myself, and I did so from my Ubuntu installation which was already configured properly. These are the files I happened to import based on my needs:  ul li/etc/ppp/options/li li/etc/ppp/pap-secrets/li li/etc/chatscripts (optional) - you only import this if you are using one of these chatscripts yourself./li /ul  h1Delete Default Route before running pppd/h1  It might help to remove the default route before running pppd to assist in enforcing that the PPP connection becomes the default connection to the internet:   note: I found this more of an issue on my Ubuntu installation, but haven't had to this on OSX. Still here are the commands:  OSX command: codesudo route delete default/code br   Other Linux: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;codesudo route del default/code    When you disconnect pppd and reconnect your regular internet, the route will be restored.
