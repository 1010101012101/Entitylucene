Escape sequence in terminal or iTerm to jump to absolute column? <body> Is there an escape sequence which I can use to jump to an absolute column in OS X Yosemite Terminal or iTerm?  In other words:  precodeecho 12345678901234567890 echo \StartAtColumn10 A10 \StartAtColumn2 B2 /code/pre  Would produce the following output:  precode12345678901234567890  B2      A10 /code/pre  I want to send this code from R to format progress output.  <answer168508> Not too sure what you are looking for, but I think you are looking something like codecolumn/code command. May be?  precode$ echo \A10 \B2 | column -s\ -t A10 B2 /code/pre  For more info: codeman column/code.  <answer168673> You can use code\r/code to return to the beginning of the line (column 1) and then code\e[nC/code to move right coden/code characters (column n+1). So:  precode$ echo 12345678901234567890; echo $'\r\e[9CA10' $'\r\e[1CB2' 12345678901234567890  B2      A10 /code/pre  <comment197809> That would surely work - but I want to send the output from R, ( `cat()` function). So I can not use a second command like `column`.
