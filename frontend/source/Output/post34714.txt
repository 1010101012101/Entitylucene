Is it possible to log out of 'mail' on the iPad? <body> I set up my email into the iPad 'Mail' app, and I cannot find how you log out to prevent another user from opening and reading my mail.  Is it possible to log out of 'mail' on the iPad?  <answer34716> As far as I know, this is not possible. iPad is not made to be a multi-user device. I am in a similar situation myself as I share the iPad with my wife but haven't yet fixed it. Some alternatives:  ol liSet a different account as default account in Settings  Mail, Contacts, Calendars. It could even be a dummy account. At least it means email will not be sent accidentally from your address./li liIn Settings  Mail, Contacts, Calendars  [Your email account], you can turn off Mail temporarily. It does not provide any security though, anyone can just turn it on again./li liIf you want to guarantee security, you need to use something like Gmail in Safari and login and logout every time./li /ol  <answer43212> Go to settings then select mail go to hotmail or whatever you use and delet the account from your device you can always log back on  <answer65674> Go to settings, click mail, click the first button ( the one thats at the top ) , click delete account andd PROBLEM SOLVED!  <answer81556> just go to setting, click mail and put mail off.. thats all finish, want to access again mail on.  <answer92566> Go to Settings, Reset App, and Reset.

On the iPhone, you can also turn off the ability to change the Mail settings; which requires a passcode.  Settings - General - Restrictions - Allow Changes (Accounts)  It's a bit of a hassle; but, by turning off the mail account, and then disallowing changes to the account settings, you can prevent the mail from being accessed.  <answer93084> As a drastic measure you could remove the account by going to Settings - Mail/Contacts/Calendars and deleting it there.  <answer112056> Go to settings go to mail (it will say mail contacts calendars) once your in scroll to the bitten it will say delet account   <answer113784> Go to strongSettings  Mail, contacts, calendars/strong and in the list of accounts,  tap the On/Off button to turn off Outlook.  <answer126089> Go to Settings â†’ Mail, Contacts &amp; Calendars, then go to your email settings and erase your password.

I'd actually like to write an applescript like i have for my desktop to disable my mail while I'm at work because everytime i get an email my MBP, iPhone and iPad all go off and it's annoying haha <comment216903> This doesn't exactly answer the question. The question was how to prevent other users from accessing email by logging out, not by deleting the account.
