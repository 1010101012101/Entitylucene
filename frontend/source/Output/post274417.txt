Folder With Question Mark After SSD Upgrade And OS Reinstall <body> I have a problem with my friend’s iMac (mid-2010) that I'm fixing. I’ve replaced his hard drive with an SSD (the Samsung 850 evo) and after reinstalling the OS via recovery mode (kbdcmd/kbd+kbdR/kbd) it shows a folder with a question mark in it during the boot.  Here's what I've tried so far to fix it:  1) Tried another hard disk (used a 2.5” mechanical drive that I otherwise use for backups) and it worked without the issue on this one.  2)Tried upgrading the sata cable with a new one but it didn’t work.  3)Run First Aid From Disk Utility. The SSD is ok:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PL5Nz.jpg" alt="SSD ok after first aid"  4) Tried to select the Startup Disk, but the SSD doesn’t show up! What’s strange is that I can see the SSD in Disk Utility and I was even able to perform the OS installation, but yet it doesn't show up when selecting a startup disk.  5) Tried NVRAM reset (kbdcmd/kbd+kbdopt/kbd+kbdR/kbd+kbdP/kbd) but it still doesn't work.   6) Connected the SSD to my PC via a sata to usb cable to check if it works and it works correctly there.  The crazy thing is that I can erase the SSD with disk utility, I can reinstall the OS and at the end of the installation, after the reboot, it still shows the folder with the question mark during boot.  strongWhat else can I try to fix the issue?/strong br  hr  Here's how the SSD shows up in Disk Utility:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7aWjq.jpg" alt="SSD"  <comment345060> Can I get a screenshot of the Federico drive to see? <comment345061> Also, have you tried running AHT? See [this article](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT201257) if you don't know how. <comment345114> @bret7600 here is a screen of the Federico drive http://imgur.com/kVPXBlZ . In a while I will try to run AHT since I need the CD which I don't have at the moment.
