Preview: Remove all annotations <body> Is it possible, using Preview (or maybe some other tool if not doable with Preview, but Preview preferably) to remove emall/em annotations from a PDF file, without manually deleting every annotation?  <answer52225> In the "Tools menu", choose "show inspector". In the inspector, select "Annotations inspector".   Press kbdCMD/kbd+kbdA/kbd to select all annotations, then click kbdbackspace/kbd to delete them.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1WQuH.png" alt="Screenshot"
