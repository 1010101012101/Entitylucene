Prompting personal warning before putting my Macbook Pro to sleep <body> I carry my Macbook Pro (15" Retina, Mid 2012 with Mt. Lion) between my work and home. It is connected to an external HDD as a Time Machine. I always forget to properly eject the HDD before putting my notebook to sleep (I rarely shut it down) at my office.  Is there a way to have it prompt with a custom reminder or warning when I try to put MBP to sleep, using Automator or something?  <answer60171> You could have the drive automatically ejected when you sleep the mac instead?  Quick search found Jettison on the Mac App Store http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/jettison/id447430809?mt=12  There is also an app you can use to run Apple script on sleep/wake: http://www.lagentesoft.com/scenario/index.html  <answer60180> You can write an AppleScript to do this, then instead of picking sleep from the  menu, you can select your script from the Script menu.  All of this can be set up from within strongAppleScript Editor/strong:  ul liLaunch strongAppleScript Editor/strong/li liOpen strongPreferences/strong/li liCheck the box to "Show Script menu in menu bar". img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Gc2PW.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liCreate a new script/li liHere is the content of the script:  precodedisplay dialog "Are you sure you want to put the computer to sleep?" do shell script "pmset sleepnow" /code/pre/li liSave the script as code~/Library/Scripts/Applications/AppleScript Editor/Sleep.scpt/code/li /ul  Now you can put your computer to sleep from the script menu and be warned before sleeping.  <comment69292> Do you put it to sleep by closing the lid? Using the keyboard shortcut? Selecting `Sleep` from the `` menu? <comment69310> I do it by going to the Apple menu. Closing the lid would not give me any chance to see the warning. <comment69314> Right. That's why I asked. <comment69333> Thanks, that's pretty much what I was looking for. Will try at the end of the day.
