How do you use Greek letters in pages, 5.5.2? <body> Need to use some Greek letters using pages, 5.5.2?  <answer179359> Open the Character Viewer and drag the letters from there in to your document.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RZczL.jpg" alt="Greek"  If you have to use it more frequently you can set it up bit automated, in the syst pref- Keyboard- Text. Then assign a Greek letter to some word like when you type Beta it would be replaced with Greek β.  <answer179365> Use http://www.unicodeit.net  You can also turn it into a Service, so just use LaTeX notation (like \alpha for α), highlight, and use some unique keybinding (I use shift-opt-cmd-u) and it will convert to the unicode character.  Works across the system.  <comment212569> occasional? always?, sometimes? easy switchable on/off ?
