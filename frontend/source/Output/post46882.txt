How do I move a third-party application's menulet from one location to another in the menu bar? <body> I bought QuickCal 3 from the Mac App Store recently.  Now, when I boot my Mac, the QuickCal menu icon shows on the menu bar, and where it wants to by default, I suppose.  Since QuickCal has the ability to show the current day of the month within its icon, I thought it would work best if strongpositioned next to my clock./strong  I'm trying to save space in my menu bar (I have a lot of crap there already, you'll see), so I have "Show date" turned off for the built-in clock.  But, since I want to have the QuickCal icon, I figure it can do double-duty and add back in the day of the month .. my aging brain can still remember the month, anyway.  So, stronghow can I accomplish this:/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kYOd9.png" alt="Screenshot showing my QuickCal menu bar icon and the position I&#39;d like to move it to, next to the clock."  That is, stronghow can I reposition a menu icon in the OS X menu bar?/strong  I tried dragging, but that didn't work.  Is there a way to do this in OS X (e.g. is there a keystroke I need to use emwhile/em dragging?), or some preferences I'm not aware of?  I realize my specific request may be a challenge because I want to move a 3rd party menu item in between two OS X built-in ones (The clock, &amp; battery status.)  Failing that, is there a third party tool I need to add to the multitude I installed already?  In the olden days on Windows XP, I used to have a tool called Taskbar Shuffle that permitted rearrangement of icons in the taskbar and system tray .. anything similar for OS X (but for the menu bar)?  Thanks!  <answer46901> You can't move it into the same area as the OS icons.  The only way to rearrange the third-party apps is to close programs and re-open them, because they appear in the order the programs were opened.  <answer85564> I recently came across this free tool:  Broomstick.  One of its features is "Customize Order of Menubar Icons."  I was able to use it to reorder some third party menu bar icons, but as @AndrewLatham has noted in his answer, this also wouldn't permit moving a third-party app's menu icon into the area used by the OS X icons.  <answer85570> Two possible items found at cnet.com ... I haven't tried them myself.    Login Items Engine    Login Control    <answer162847> The only way I've found to be able to do this is by using Bartender. It's all I use Bartender for (which makes the $15 price tag seem a little steep); I hide the Bartender icon and disable the other features. But it does a beautiful job of allowing me to command-drag menu bar icons.   <answer254841> You can do this in macOS Sierra without using any third-party apps. All you need to do is hold the codeCommand/code key down while you click and drag the application icon to another spot in the menu bar.  <comment53682> They are all launched automatically when I log in.  Is there a way to change that launch order? <comment53684> Yes, go to your startup items options and rearrange the order the programs launch in.

I can move Menu Meters all the way over to Spotlight. <comment98591> possible duplicate of [How can I have a fixed order of the menu-extras?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/35023/how-can-i-have-a-fixed-order-of-the-menu-extras) <comment98633> Command-drag it and see if it works. <comment98634> Thanks, tried, doesn't drag.  Just opened the QuickCal menu.  :/ <comment98635> Oh, some third-party menulets don't allow you to move them. AFAIK, your only option would be to re-arrange the other menulets in your menu bar so that the QuickCal menulet is all the way to the right. <comment105042> @daviesgeek care to share how? For somethings CMD+Drag works, but not for others. <comment105086> Actually since then, I found out that Menu Meters uses some sort of plugin to be able to do that. Command-drag works though, for Menu Meters. <comment200223> `they appear in the order the programs were opened` seems not to be true. I just tried with f.lux and TODOist. They order was the same no matter the launch order
