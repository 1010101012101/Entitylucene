Putting line-breaks in the (Mountain) Lion lock screen message <body> On Mountain Lion, in the [Security &amp; Privacy] pane of System Preferences, you can enter a lock screen message that gets displayed on the login/lock screen.br Sometimes, you might want to put a line break or a paragraph gap there. You might think that you could do this, hence the large text box, however you can't - even if it looks like you can. kbdEnter/kbd or kbdShift/kbd+kbdEnter/kbd doesn't enter a line break. I know it's possible, because iCloud does it when you lock your computer with Find My iPhone.br Is it actually possible to enter line breaks in your lock screen message?  <answer84493> It actually is. You can't do it directly from System Preferences - you can do it using TextEdit. Just type your lock screen message into TextEdit and copy-paste into the text box in System Preferences. If you use more than three lines, then a scroll bar appears and everything looks all buggy and ugly. Three lines or less works perfectly - in fact, I have three lines right now! (Third line blacked out as it contains my email address)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EIuM7.png" alt="The lock screen sheet, showing a multi-line message."  <answer204938> Press kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdEnter/kbd for a new line (or kbdOption/kbd+kbdEnter/kbd, which seems to work as well).  <comment266987> This isn't entirely true. Pat's answer is correct in saying that you can add a line directly in System Preferences, but they got the key combination wrong. I'll submit an edit.
