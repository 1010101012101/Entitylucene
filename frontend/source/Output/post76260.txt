Mountain Lion always switches to previous application at wake up <body> Since upgrading to Mountain Lion (from Snow Leopard), I have noticed that always when I wake up my MacBook Pro, a window from the previously active application is moved to the front.  What causes this? Can I turn this "feature" off?  <answer76378> Thanks Daniel Lawson for pointing to the solution:  The issue is cause by the 'require password after sleep or screen saver begins' option in the system security settings. If you turn this off, the issue disappears.  <comment88593> FWIW, I had this problem [long before Mountain Lion](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/21142/mid-2011-macbook-air-changes-applications-on-wake-from-sleep).
