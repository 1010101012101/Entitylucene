How can I repeatedly invoke Firefox for a URL from the Emacs *scratch* buffer? <body> In the Emacs emshell/em buffer I can do:  precodeopen -a  Firefox.app http://www.google.com /code/pre  repeatedly and Firefox will open each time, showing the Google screen (I quit Firefox each time).  If I have the following in the Emacs emscratch/em buffer and repeatedly evaluate:  precode(shell-command "open -a  Firefox.app http://www.google.com") /code/pre  I will see Firefox trying to open in Safe Mode (if I am quitting Firefox each repetition).  If I only close Firefox windows each repetition, then things seem well-behaved.  What additional things would I have to do in order to avoid Firefox trying to open in Safe Mode -- for the case of using the emscratch/em buffer to open a URL with Firefox and quitting Firefox afterwards?  The repeated invocation of Firefox from the emshell/em buffer probably works because only one process is started for the whole emshell/em buffer session.  Similar behavior is seen if Firefox is chosen as the default browser and the command is simplified to:  precodeopen http://www.google.com /code/pre  Similar behavior is seen if Firefox is the default browser and one repeatedly evaluates:  precode(browse-url "http://www.google.com") /code/pre  in the emscratch/em buffer in Emacs (quitting Firefox each repetition).  Deactivating Firefox plugins and add ons does not change this behavior.  My Emacs version is:     GNU Emacs 24.5.1 (x86_64-apple-darwin13.4.0, NS apple-appkit-1265.21) of 2015-04-10 on builder10-9.porkrind.org   Updating Emacs to  GNU Emacs 25.1.1 (x86_64-apple-darwin13.4.0, NS appkit-1265.21 Version 10.9.5 (Build 13F1911)) of 2016-09-20  does not change this behavior.  The computer is a MacBook Air 13 (mid 2012), running Mac OSX 10.11.6.  The Firefox version is Firefox 49.0.1.  <comment318511> I can't replace the problem here, running `(shell-command "open -a  Firefox.app http://www.google.com")` in `*scratch*` opens Firefox just fine (without Safe Mode). Are there any Firefox Addons which have an influence here? <comment318625> Deactivating Firefox plugins and addons does not change the behavior I've described.  You won't see the window offering to open Firefox in Safe Mode appear the first time you evaluate one of my examples in `*scratch*`.  You have to Quit Firefox and again evaluate one of my examples in *scratch*.
