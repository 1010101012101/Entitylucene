Mail.app button to explicitly move to Junk without built-in filtering <body> I'd like to create a button in Mountain Lion's Mail.app to move mail to an IMAP folder called Junk, much like the Archive button moves mail to my IMAP Archive folder.  (This folder is automatically emptied on my server periodically and used to train spam filters.)  I thought perhaps I could leverage the Junk button, but that seems to require turning on the built-in filtering engine, which I do not believe I want to do.  I specifically want to just move the message myself explicitly.  I'm currently using the Favorites bar, to which I've added the requisite folder, and I can either drag messages there or use the keyboard shortcut (e.g. kbdcommand/kbd-kbdcontrol/kbd-kbd4/kbd, since it's the fourth folder on my barâ€”unfortunately, I find such a combo awkward to press), but I'd really prefer a button I could stick on the toolbar.  <answer86308> You can do this exactly by "customizing" the action that the "Junk" button performs:  Mail emMenu/em Preferences Junk Mail emtab/em  When Junk Mail Arrives: emselect/em strongPerform Custom actions (Click Advanced to configure)/strong  Then, click emAdvanced/em button in lower center of Pref Pane, next to emReset/em  This allows you to create a custom Rule, essentialy, just like other Rules, in the "Rules" Preference Pane, but it activates when you click the "Junk" button or when Mail thinks it found something that is Junk (keep reading to limit automatic Junk Mail filtering).  ul li*Notice how the default rule has the condition that "Message is Junk"? emPossibly/em just removing this will avoid Mail from auto-triggering the filter, maybe, however, there is another step we can take (keep reading)./li li*I would probably delete all the conditions here by default (which are just the same as the default actions)/li /ul  The rule I would suggest is:  ul liIf "any" of the following conditions are met/li li"account" is "strongemname of your account in question/em/strong"/li liPerform the following actions "Move Message" to mailbox "strongemname of the mailbox that you have set-up on your server as 'Junk' or similar/em/strong" (as oppose to the "Junk" folder built-in to Mail.app)/li /ul  That's emmost/em of it.

My favorite is Cocktail.  If you can't find the LSMMAP2 file, just use the Junk Mail button for a little while, then come back and look for it again.

I'll give this one a shot and come back after I've put it through its paces. <comment99841> This seems to be working pretty well.  FWIW, I went ahead and just set it to move the message to Junk, since it lands in the proper place for this account.
