ERROR: AUCTeX cannot find a working TeX distribution (macOS Sierra) <body> I have installed MacTex and GNU Emacs on my iMac. I have created a simple tex file (the one suggested here) and tried to run LaTeX on it by hitting C-c C-c, but the following message appeared:     ERROR: AUCTeX cannot find a working TeX distribution.br   Make sure you have one and that TeX binaries are in PATH environment variable.br   If you are using OS X El Capitan or laterbr   remember to add /Library/TeX/texbin/ to your PATH   Opening Terminal and running     echo $PATH   yields     /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.4/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/Library/TeX/texbin   hr  Operating system: macOS Sierra, Version 10.12.4br Emacs version: 25.1.1br AUCTeX version: 11.90.0br MacTex distribution: MacTeX-2016  <answer278032> The problem you are having is because Emacs does not get the $PATH variable when it is started from the Finder and therefore does not set codeexec-path/code properly.  An easy solution is to install the Emacs package execpath-from-shell  <answer278069> As patrix suggested, the problem was that the PATH variable that the error message referred to was not the Terminal's environment variable but emacs' own environment variable, whose content can be seen (as suggested by patrix) by evaluating code(getenv "PATH")/code in Emacs.   To add code/Library/TeX/texbin//code to emacs' PATH variable, I added the following code to the emacs initialization file code.emacs/code:  precode(setenv "PATH" (concat (getenv "PATH") ":/Library/TeX/texbin/"))   (setq exec-path (append exec-path '("/Library/TeX/texbin/"))) /code/pre  These lines of code are appropriately modified versions of the ones given here.  After restarting Emacs, the problem was gone.  <comment349754> Terminal may have a different PATH than Emacs, try evaluating `(getenv "PATH")` in the scratch buffer to check. <comment349769> @patrix Could you make your comment an an answer so people know that the question has been addressed. <comment349772> My comment isn't an answer, just a debugging step. The answer should explain how to set the path for Emacs, or how to configure AucTeX correctly (I'm sure there are some variables/hooks to point AucTeX to the TeX installation).
