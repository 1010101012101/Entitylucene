You can't use Airport Utility without Airport Extreme? <body> I want to use Airport Utility to settle wireless time limits, it seems that I can't use Airport Utility. Is it because you can use Airport Utility only with Apple hardware like  Airport Extreme?  <answer127319> Airport Utility is only for Apple's line of Airport wireless routers. This includes Airport Express, Airport Extreme, and Time Capsule. It does not support other routers.
