Unable to Open /var/db/BootCaches/PreheatedUser/Merged.playlist <body> Running Mavericks and Disc Utility and fsck report no errors.  Safe Boot reports codeUnable to open /var/db/BootCaches/PreheatedUser/Merged.playlist/code.  Found a tutorial (or three) recommending to enter Single User mode to:  precodefsck -fy mount -uw / rm -rf /etc/launchd.conf reboot /code/pre  However code/etc/launchd.conf/code doesn't appear to exist.  Additionally I'm starting Safe Boot in verbose mode (kbd⇧/kbd + kbd⌘/kbd + kbdv/kbd while starting) it says it's logging to code/dev/console/code but I'm not sure how to access the data say by having it written to a file I could later read or pipe to mail or printer.  At the moment the computer, even in Safe Boot, gets stuck somewhere between loading the desktop image, status bar at the top and showing the apps at the bottom of the screen.
