Access iCloud.com from iPhone <body> I noticed that in the HTML of icloud.com there are meta tags for creating a webapp on iOS devices. However it is impossible to get to just icloud.com on the iPhone, instead it redirects you to icloud.com/iphone_welcome.  Am I missing something? Or is this some future capability?  <answer71060> Safari on iPhone will always be redirected to the welcome page. AFAIK there's no chance to just access www.icloud.com with Safari. However, you can try Google's Chrome Browser. It has an option to access a page in a desktop version. That will bring up the original iCloud page with the login dialog.  <comment86560> What do you want to do on iCloud.com on the iPhone that you can't do on the iPhone directly? (Edit Contact groups?) <comment86657> If its not my phone, and I just quickly want to check my emails etc?
