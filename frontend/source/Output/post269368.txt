Mac Mail keeps losing the 2 factor auth passwords for Gmail <body> My laptop (MacBook Pro late 2012 running OS X 10.10.5) has had an issue the last two mornings. When I turn it on I get a load of notifications saying that I need to re-enter the password for my internet accounts.  Digging a little deeper what has happened is the 2 factor auth passwords used for Mac Mail Gmail accounts have all been lost. Any ideas why this keeps happening overnight and what I can do to prevent it?  I've tried going to System Preferences  Internet Accounts and updating the passwords used to a Google app specific password (the system Google uses to get around applications that don't support their 2 factor auth) but when I do this it insists that I use a 2 factor login.  <answer270067> I had the same problem. I updated to Sierra and then Mail kept asking for password but did not help when I re-entered them. I dug deeper and found the ports needed to be corrected (in Mail Preferences). Did that and it works now.  <answer270113> I was able to resolve the issue by:  ol liGoing into Keychain and deleting all of the Google auth tokens for all of my Google apps for business and Gmail accounts./li liDelete one of the internet accounts completelybr (I don't think this step is essential but it's what I did)/li liRestart the machine/li liRe-add the account I deleted, re-populate the passwords for the accounts that were missing them. /li /ol  This seems to solve the issue temporarily as I haven't had it reoccur for a few days, but after a month of working fine, the issue has come back. Running through the steps again worked.
