How can I recover deleted iWeb and iDVD? <body> When I got my MacBook Pro (1st version) last week on OS X Yosemite, it came with iWeb and iDVD but I deleted them and now I want them back. I haven't backed up using Time Machine.  <answer162230> iWeb and iDVD does not work in Yosemite anywayâ€”crashes immediately on launch.  <comment189427> They are probably still there pending how you deleted them. <comment189613> i deleted them by going into my finder and deleted n the applications. i just threw them into trash but i emptied my trash <comment189627> That is why the trash bucket is there, and it is not to be emptied instantly :(
