History of my iPhone apps <body> Is there a way to know the last time I reinstalled a specific app?  Also, how many times I have reinstalled it?    <answer143199> Unfortunately not—there is no way to know that without jailbreaking.  <answer143213> If you're jailbroken, you can check when you installed an app by going to the application's container in /var/mobile/Applications and check the date modified of the iTunesMetadata.plist.  There is no way to check how many times you have reinstalled an app, even with a jailbreak.  <comment168660> Not even with a jailbreak? <comment168668> I've edited your answer to clarify that it's not possible without a jailbreak. If you have reason to believe that my answer will not work, feel free to edit your answer to expand it. —cc @patrix
