How to mirror and record multiple ipad screens in parallel? <body> I know this question has been asked before and the answer has been to use either the AirServer or Reflector. I have already tried both of them. They crash and/or have inconsistent behavior when the number of iPads being recorded goes above 15. Are there any alternative open/commercial solutions available?   Thanks in advance! Ree
