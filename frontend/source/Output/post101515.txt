Keyboard layout occasionally changes <body> I have a MacBook Pro and use a wireless keyboard. Both keyboards physically are a US English layout. In my user preferences I selected "U.S. Extended" as a keyboard layout. No others are selected.  Every now and then, with no pattern I've been able to discern, the keyboard layout will change to British. It doesn't necessary change when I reboot, and as I have only one input source enabled it shouldn't be that I'm inadvertently hitting a keyboard shortcut to switch layouts. When I go back to Input Sources after it changes, "British" will be selected and "U.S. English" no longer selected. I can change it back, but a few days or weeks later it will change again.  I probably did choose British when I did a clean install of Mountain Lion some time ago. That shouldn't make a difference to a user preference.  Where can the British layout setting be sneaking in? How can I stop this reverting once and for all?  <comment119690> You could try deleting `~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.HIToolbox.*.plist` or `/var/root/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.HIToolbox.*.plist`. <comment122889> So far this has worked. If it were an answer I'd accept it
