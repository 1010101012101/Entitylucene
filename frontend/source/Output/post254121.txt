Why’s my boot partition converted from HFS+ to core storage logical volume after each OS upgrade? <body> I just upgraded my 2013 MBP from Yosemite to Sierra. I opened Disk Utility and ran a quick verification. All checked out fine, but the boot drive now reported as a logical volume rather than HFS+. The same thing happened when I upgraded from Mavericks to Yosemite. To fix it, I just manually reverted the logical volume back using codediskutil/code which worked like a charm.   Despite the fact core storage is more susceptible to filesystem corruption, for some reason this seems to be the new status quo for Apple OS upgrades regardless of your previous configuration. I don’t use filevault and the partition scheme hasn’t been altered. It’s the same unencrypted 1 TB SSD that came with the machine.  So, what’s the benefit of the core storage scheme? Is there a reason I shouldn't just revert back to HFS+ as I did before?  <comment316326> CS is just another layer (LVM: Logical Volume Manager) between the hardware and the file system. So the final file system in all three cases (CS w/ or w/o FileVault or no CS at all) is always (J)HFS+. "Reverting back to HFS+" is therefore a false assumption. "Reverting back to a non-LVM partition scheme" is more suitable.
