Remove all items in mdfind <body> How would I remove all of the items returned by mdfind? For example, I want to remove all files relating to "MacLaunchpad", so I did  precodemdfind "MacLaunchpad" /code/pre  Which returned  precode/private/var/db/receipts/o.t.maclaunchpad.postflight.pkg.plist /private/var/db/receipts/o.t.maclaunchpad.maclaunchpad.pkg.plist /private/var/db/receipts/o.t.maclaunchpad.postflight.pkg.bom /private/var/db/receipts/o.t.maclaunchpad.launchpad.pkg.plist /private/var/db/receipts/o.t.maclaunchpad.launchpad.pkg.bom /private/var/db/receipts/o.t.maclaunchpad.maclaunchpad.pkg.bom /code/pre  I wish to remove all of these files; how would I go about doing that?  <answer176011> There are at least two ways for this  ul licoderm $(mdfind "MacLaunchpad")/code/li licodemdfind "MacLaunchpad" | xargs rm/code/li /ul  I would go with the first one.
