Safari (5) or Mac OS X (10.6 Snow Leopard): Is past HTTP Post data stored? <body> In either Safari 5 (history intact) or Snow Leopard, is there a way to view a sent HTTP Post request? A session expired and I am looking for the data that was posted (and lost).  <answer43230> No. Post data is deliberately never saved.  It's the most common way to send private data to a server, such as passwords every time you log in. It will never be saved unless the server writes it to a database somewhere.
