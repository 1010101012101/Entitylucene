How to pin a URL to OS X Dock with a custom image? <body> I'd like to pin a URL to the Dock and have its icon be something meaningful or recognizable.  By default, the icon/shortcut is a generic spring icon, and in Yosemite it shows a globe.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DQ0hO.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oFbn2.png" alt="enter image description here"  How can I create or modify a docked URL shortcut to be the site's favicon or an image I choose?  <answer58258> ol liMove/drag the shortcut to the Desktop first/li liFind an image (on the web, etc.) Open it in Preview, Select All, and Copy.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/obhfq.png" alt=""/li liOpen Get Info on your shortcut on the Desktop.

It will highlight to be blue.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5SdSq.png" alt=""/li liCommand-V to paste the image over top of the icon./li liClose the properties window./li liDrag the shortcut icon to the Dock/li /ol  <answer192542> You can take it a step further too.  If you have several shortcuts you would like to keep handy, create a folder.  Using the same procedure as noted by in the previous answer you can change the folder's icon to anything you wish as well and then pin that to your strongDock/strong.  ul liCreate a strongFolder/strong in a location of your choice (strongDocuments/strong is good)/li liAdd your weblinks/li liChange the folder's icon in the same manner as previously described./li liDrag the new folder to your strongDock/strong/li liChange the strongDisplay as/strong and strongView content as/strong to your liking./li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BdX6i.png" alt="Links folder"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/z10ZL.png" alt="Settings"  Set to strongDisplay as... Folder/strong Otherwise you get a stack of icons... UGLY.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xtPEo.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment300279> I would add a minor point, when you put it on the dock at the bottom you need to put it to the right of the little black line that is on the left of the trashcan and download folder. Basically you are creating a folder and thats where folders and files can be pinned to the dock. Great life hack though so thanks to the two posts above this one.
