Is there a way to not have Lion not launch apps from previous startup? <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   Reopen windows when logging back in - NOTbr   How can I keep restore for apps in Lion without having session restore when I log in?       I've heard conflicting info on this - seems like a good place for an option on startup. Any ideas? I just want a clean slate and find it annoying.  <answer47370> You can change this in codeSystem Preferences &gt; General/code. Look for the "Restore windows when quitting and re-opening apps" check box and uncheck it.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9bPe8.png" alt="enter image description here"
