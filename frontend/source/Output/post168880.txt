How to fix com.apple.dock.extra? <body> I'm a gamer and one day  i was playing mine craft when this blabbering thing just showed up. I went to activity monitor and there was a process called codecom.apple.dock.extra/code. From the first day there was a annoying voice all the time and when i went to internet pages, i could not scroll down as it would go back up to the top again. Just yesterday i was playing mine craft when my up key stopped working. After some investigating, i think it has to do with com.apple.dock.extra. Whenever i press up, the annoying little black box goes up to multiple links and says them out to me. Finally, there is a big black box that appears telling me where my system is. My computer is a 13 inch MacBook Air version 10.7.4 and i have Mac OS X Lion 10.7.4. I have a 1.8 GHZ processor. Could someone PLEASE tell me how to fix it, as this is my school computer.  <answer168890> You could try this fix:  In Finder use the Go to and go to code/System/Library/CoreServices/Dock.app/Contents/XPCServices/code  In XPCServices Folder and strongmove/strong the codecom.apple.dock.extra.xpc/code file to desktop.  Then go back to the activity monitor and force quit the process and test!  Source: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4263912 user jximo 07  <comment198287> NO! DO NOT DO THIS! Never ever delete anything inside /System. <comment198289> @ganbustein you are right, lets not delete, lets just move it for now. <comment305156> Does this happen when you quit Finder (open finder then press command+q)?
