Using 3 External monitors on my macbook pro, problem with DVD player <body> I am running 3 external monitors off of my macbook pro 10.6.8. When I try to watch a DVD, the player slides down to my macbook pro. Want to play it on a larger monitor. Possible?  <answer81450> Yes.  When you are in DVD Player, code&lt;command&gt;-F/code to exit full screen mode.  Then drag the window to the monitor you want to use and code&lt;command&gt;-F/code to switch back to full screen mode.
