Printing to a Windows printer from the command line (smbclient -c "print") <body> I am trying to print to a Windows printer server requiring authentication from the command line.  An option is to use codekinit/code to get a Kerberos ticket (and it works).  On a Linux machine I also managed to use codesmbclient/code  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"code$ smbclient -U d\\user //server/printer -c "print tiger.ps" Enter d\user's password:  Domain=[D] OS=[Windows Server 2012 Standard 9200] Server=[Windows Server 2012 Standard 6.2] putting file tiger.ps as tiger.ps (7524.4 kb/s) (average 7524.5 kb/s) /code/pre  Now from OS X 10.7 Apple replaced Samba with an own implementation. codesmbutil/code does not seem to have a command to print. Are there alternatives?
