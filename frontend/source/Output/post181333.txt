No colour dots to tag folders. Macbook Pro, OSX 10.10.3 <body> I have just recently bought a used Macbook Pro with Yosemite installed. So far everything seemed to work ok, except today I tried to tag a folder with the coloured dot and found it not possible. The dots are there, but they have no colour. This doesn't look right and I haven't seen anything like this before. Has anyone encountered anything like that? I would greatly appreciate your help?  Please check the screenshot attached below.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zv8oQ.png" alt="context menu of a random test folder"    <answer181336> Probably the color tags have been disabled previously or some non-color tags are enabled instead. Just open Finder - Preferences - Tags and enable all color tags and all non-color tags you need.  <answer182424> I can tag files, but when I click on a tag in the side bar, no files are shown. This worked up until recently.  I did have to remove a bunch of Safari-related files to fix a problem with bookmarks; must have broken tags somehow.  <comment215640> Yep that's where it was - probably the Mac I am using came from abroad and had English named tags with no colours enabled, while the Polish coloured tags were disabled. Thank you again @klanomath :)  P.S. Italy was great :) <comment215646> @klanomath can you open a chat with me please? <comment215647> I try to please wait a moment.
