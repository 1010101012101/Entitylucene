Running GUI application from Console Login <body> What I'm trying to do is after logging into the console on my mac mini run safari. Its on 10.6.8 if that matters, I've tried a 10.8.3 machine. Once logged in, I login as root. From here is it possible to run a browser like Safari or Firefox?   I've tried codeopen /Applications/Safari.app/code This gives codeLSOpenURLsWithRole() failed with error -10810 for the file /Applications/Safari.app./code  And I've also tried codestartx/code and codeopen /Applications/Utilities/X11.app/code This throws a lot of errors on the 10.6.8 machine.  On the 10.8.3 machine with XQuartz installed i get the following:  precodefont_cache: Scanning user font directories to generate X11 font caches font_cache: Updating FC cache font_cache: Done xauth:  file /var/root/.serverauth.5451 does not exist  /opt/X11/bin/xinit: giving up /opt/X11/bin/xinit: unable to connect to X server: Connection refused /opt/X11/bin/xinit: server error /code/pre  Is this possible? Essentially my end goal is to, without buying Kiosk software, open GUI applications without finder or the dock.  <answer90141> Safari won't run under Xquartz/X11 which themselves need a non-console session to run.  You could select a web browser that runs under X11 exclusively and boot to a unix OS other than OS X and accomplish your needs.  Alternatively, you could set up a managed user on the Mac and have it launch Safari. Depending on what you need, parental controls or simple finder and dock hiding might be able to accomplish your goals - but the kiosk software is sold since they've engineered a solution where the OS doesn't have a setting to simply enable equivalent functionality.
