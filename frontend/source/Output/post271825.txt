Bug? macOS Sierra Preview/Quick Look issues with rendering colors of images when using any icc profile other than the macOS standard <body> When I installed Sierra I also profiled my display (with a spectrometer) and stronghave been using the created icc profiles since then/strong. Both Quick Look preview and the macOS preview app when displaying images will show weird colors though: cutout deep burned shadows! The strangest thing is that on the quicklook preview, the colors will be fine until I zoom in the image: After that it will darken, and never recover (until I reopen the preview).  This behavior happens for images (tested jpg,png and raw) that have an embedded profile, a referenced profile or are not color managed at all. Even with the Screenshots that one can grab with Cmd+Shift+3.  Photoshop and Affinity Photo display colors properly (and rather consistently) on all the above scenarios.  I discovered that it won't happen when the original display profile (named imac) is used, but will happen strongwith all the other profiles/strong, created both by basICColor and ArgyllCMS.  Here's a sample:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZW0jC.jpg" alt="from left to right, the rendering of the same file in Preview(quick look is the same), Apple Photos App, Photoshop and Affinity Photo"  emFrom left to right, the rendering of the same file in Preview(quick look is the same), Apple Photos App, Photoshop and Affinity Photo/em  Anobody having a clue what is going on? It's been bothering me for months!   Edit (an interesting discovery): emI discovered that strongun/strongchecking "embed color profile" while viewing the strongExport As../strong dialog on Photoshop, exhibits a similar darkening issue that is fixed if I revert my strongSystem Preferences/strong to using the default display profile. The file saved is fine though. Probably Adobe is using macOS's previewing capabilities inside their strongExport As.../strong dialog? I wouldn't know.../em. emApple Photos app is exhibiting a similar behavior, but the results is not so exaggerated as it is in the preview/quick look tool/em  Here (on the left) is how QuickLook shows an image when I first open it, and then (on the right) when I double tap (with my magic mouse) to cause it to zoom. When the image is already 1:1 scale like this one, it won't zoom further, but the color weirdness does kick in anyways. Zooming out, doesn't solve the problem. One has to close QuickLook to recover original colors. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rbPpn.jpg" alt="quicklook destroys colors when zooming"  <answer272068> Here's a primer on ColorSync and Apple's color management. If the following doesn't help resolve strongthe color shift when zooming in on QuickLook previews/strong, then I suggest you submit a bug report to Apple: https://developer.apple.com/bug-reporting/     h1"The strangest thing is that on the quicklook preview, the colors will be fine until I zoom in the image: After that it will darken, and never recover (until I reopen the preview)."/h1   Have you used the ColorSync Utility? From the Finder kbdCmd⌘/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbdu/kbd will get you to the code/Applications/Utilities//code directory where ColorSync Utility.app lives.  Check for all Quick Look files:br code/Library/QuickLook//codebr code/System/Library/QuickLook//codebr code/Users/&lt;user_name&gt;/Library/QuickLook//code    Are there any duplicate or conflicting code*.qlgenerator/code files? Also, and per the above article try:       First try running a permissions fix on the boot drive using Disk   Utility to ensure that the Quick Look plug-ins and other files the   Quick Look server needs are properly accessible, and then force Quick   Look to reload the plug-ins and its cache by running the following   commands in the Terminal:   precodeqlmanage -r qlmanage -r cache /code/pre     After this is done, clear out the Quick Look configuration files by   going to the /username/Library/Preferences folder (in Lion press the   Option key and select "Library" from the Finder's Go menu), and then   removing the files called "com.apple.quicklook.ui.helper.plist,"   "com.apple.quicklookconfig.plist," and   "com.apple.QuickLookDaemon.plist." With these files removed and the   Quick Look service reloaded, try previewing your documents again.   Are there any duplicate or conflicting code*.icc/code profiles inbr code/Library/ColorSync/Profiles//codebr code/System/Library/ColorSync/Profiles//codebr code/Users/&lt;user_name&gt;/Library/ColorSync/Profiles//code    It might help if you rebooting - maybe "zap the PRAM" (NVRAM) as well: hold kbdOption/kbd+kbdCmd⌘/kbd+kbdp/kbd+kbdr/kbd and let the computer chime at least three times while restarting then let go of the keyboard kung-fu grip.  Also, per MacIssues.com: check the Cache files in code~/Library/Caches/com.apple.QuickLookDaemon//codebr code~/Library/Caches/qlmanage//code     In addition, you can try removing the QuickLook caches manually, which   can be done by opening the user library from the Finder’s Go menu (if   it is missing from this menu, hold the Option key to reveal it). Then   open the Caches folder in the window that appears and locate and   remove the folders called “qlmanage” and “com.apple.QuickLookDaemon.”   When finished, log out and back in to your system and try using   QuickLook again.   Lastly, here are some Apple developers notes for debugging - perhaps the tool codeqlmanage/code can help you to ascertain the cause of this problem:  per codeman qlmanage/code    precode1.  qlmanage -r resets Quick Look Server and all Quick Look client's generator cache.  2.  qlmanage -m gets all sort of information on Quick Look server including the list of detected generators.  3.  qlmanage -t displays the Quick Look generated thumbnails (if available) for the specified files.  4.  qlmanage -p displays the Quick Look generated previews for the specified files.  5.  qlmanage -h displays extensive help. /code/pre  Oddly, per the answers to this stack overflow question, you will never know if Apple notices or addresses your bug. At best, I suppose you can try and narrow down the cause.  <answer272115> (After reading all the literature I could find around the issue here's what I've learned)  h1A disclaimer first/h1  There is a chance (as @Mr.Kennedy points out) that your system is suffering from issues with the quicklook generator.

Most probably an Apple's bug inside ColorSync or Preview/QuickLook/Photos, that affects strongsome/strong color profiles generated by a few profiling software, but strongdoes not affect other/strong profiles at all (such as the factory profiles).  According to some, first ColorSync issues were introduced in Mountain Lion. Others had issues in Mavericks, while others discovered it first in El Capitan. I can verify that it is still present in Sierra though. It's unclear if all these issues were all one and the same, but in here I'll treat them as such.  Adobe is aware of these issues (it was affecting Lightroom up to some version) rectified it since(2), but consequent updates by apple have complicated things since it has reemerged in a different way. There is a lengthy discussion in the Adobe forums(3).  h2Cause/h2  At the root, it is that strongcertain ICC profiles, contain information that **Apple's ColorSync/strong won't treat properly (and this affects all programs that rely on ColorSync). There have been various ideas proposed as what it is that ColorSync doesn't like about them. This issue has been linked (but inconclusively) to:  ul liLUT based icc profiles/li limatrix based icc profiles/li liparticular software used to generated the ICC profile (eg displayCal/basICColors)./li licompatibility issues with the ICC version number (ICCv2 or v4 profiles)/li liblack point compensation accounted for strongin/strong the profile curves./li liEIZO displays/li liSecondary displays/li /ul  There has been no consensus though.

I keep my icc profiles in ColorSync's folder `/Library/ColorSync/Profiles/`, also I open the utility  at times to check colorspace coverages and check gamma curves of various icc profiles, but not sure in which other way would I be using it. If you mean *having loaded* an icc profile for my monitor, yes I have via System Preferences Displays <comment341684> First Aid for the installed icc profiles, returns the same error for every and each user-generated profile: *"Header padding is not null."*  -While I've avoided repairing them for such a minor issue, I think it's worth a try repairing them this time! I'll get back with the results <comment341685> I did the repair (had to run it a few times since every time another issue would come up - all related to the padding and some invalid unicode characters in the desc string) and finally I reached zero errors. Reloaded my custom profile, relaunched the applications, but no luck. Same problem! <comment341689> thank you @Mr.Kennedy for the suggestions. I didn't find any name conflict in the /Users/.../Library/ColorSync/Profiles folder. Also I followed the steps for clearing the cache of quicklook (did not perform the last step of manually deleting the plist files since they were not in the same location and were protected on macOS Sierra) <comment341690> I also tried logging in from a different user account - same behavior <comment341710> I'd send it to https://bugreport.apple.com & see what they have to say. I can't repro on El Cap, but my icc files don't error & were probably created by something different [X-Rite in my case] Colours are consistent here in all relevant apps. BTW, apart from the obvious over-blowing in Preview, the 2 examples on the right look a bit under-contrast to me, quite a grey cast to them <comment341717> Thank you both! I've deleted the cache, rebooted, and reset the PRAM but no luck - I found the following [thread](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7291462) though, and did a bug report too - seems there are people affected on El Capitan too! Regarding the photos, yes, they were badly shot indeed ;-) <comment341943> done @Mr. Kennedy! I hope they solve it at some point! <comment341983> Thank you, that's a very thorough answer! <comment342024> wow, never knew qlmanage could do all that stuff! I'll check it out right away! I've uploaded the image you asked too <comment342029> Again the previews & thumbnails generated by `qlmanage` command line appear just fine (until I decide to zoom in). With debug level 1 I was getting a warning that there may be other qlgenerators shadowing the default one so I ran `qlmanage -g "/System/Library/QuickLook/Image.qlgenerator" -c "public.image"  -p imagename.JPG -d 1` and nothing changed <comment342034> exporting the generated thumbnails into a file also reveals that the thumbnail is properly generated - it's a problem with the display of it!
