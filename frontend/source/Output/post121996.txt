Is it possible to terminal login remotely (outside local network) to my mac at home via SSH + VPN? <body> With img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kbNRl.png" alt="enter image description here", I can access my mac at home via VNC. When in the same network, I also can access it via ssh with the name NAME.local with the help of bonjour.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Wu7ho.png" alt="enter image description here"   Then, is it possible to terminal login the mac at home via VNC + SSH or anything? I tried with NAME.local outside local network, but the name is not recognized.   h2ADDED/h2  precodessh computername.`echo show Setup:/Network/BackToMyMac | scutil | sed -n 's/.* : *\(.*\).$/\1/p'` /code/pre  also works fine.

You can obtain your address using the following command.  precodedns-sd -E /code/pre  The final line shows the account number.br Use the following syntax for determining the address:  precodecomputername.number.members.btmm.icloud.com /code/pre  Providing you have port forwarded correctly, you can use this address to connect over SSH/VNC.  <comment142298> I updated the post, could you help me out? <comment142299> @prosseek Make sure your computer name is correct — run `hostname` and use that as your computer name. <comment142300> I tried the name from `host`, but I got the same error. The name includes .local, I tried with and without it to get the same error. <comment142302> @prosseek Try setting the hostname to not include .local — run `scutil --set HostName yourcomputername` <comment142304> Well, I tried scutil, but I still get the same error. <comment142305> @prosseek Interesting, it should work I think. Do you have a firewall enabled? Stealth mode in System Preferences? <comment142307> Well, not that I aware of; I just didn't set anything more than from the default setting. VNC (Screen sharing) works fine. <comment142357> ping doesn't work, but ssh does work: http://smithjw.me/blog/2012/8/1/initiating-screen-sharing-or-back-to-my-mac-from-the-command.html
