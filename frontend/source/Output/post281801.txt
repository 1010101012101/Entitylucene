Incoming connections to netbiosd and unknown port service starting <body> I have gotten several "incoming connections to netbiosd" and blocked them.   This time, after I blocked it, I got another thing saying that an unknown port service is starting on my mac, with no option given to end the service but something else I do not remember because after about 10 seconds, I shut down so that nothing could make its way through my system.   I have no running antivirus security on my Mac though I do have the firewall from Norton's free trial still running on my machine. I had several issues like this a few months ago, but nothing scary has happened since (though I no longer access anything secure on the computer).   Also, the only thing malicious I can think that I have accessed is Quora.com, which I have visited before similar issues in the past. Is it possible for some posts on Quora to have malicious content (ones that are of inappropriate content)? I visited several Quora posts that had such text as well as images. Based on this information, do you think I am infected/at risk?  P.S. I am writing from another computer
