Reviewing documents in Word for Mac - unable to change user name for commenting <body> I am reviewing a document on behalf of someone. I use Track Changes and I am inserting comments. I want the name of the my colleague to appear in the comments and not mine (mine appears by default as the software is registered to me).   The Help function explains that I need to go to WORD/PREFERENCES/USER INFORMATION (in the PERSONAL SETTINGS section) and enter there the desired name. I tried that several times, saved the information, but as soon as I go back to the doc and insert a comment, it defaults back to my name.   I am touched by the fact that my Mac seems so attached time, but on the other hand it is quite annoying, because I do not achieve my goal.  Am I missing something? Any ideas?
