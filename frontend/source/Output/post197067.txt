How to resolve the 100% disk usage on my iMac 27" (late 2013) when in Bootcamp bootup <body> I own an iMac from the late 2013 series, it is the core i7 with 32GB RAM. I eventually established that using Bootcamp would allow for a better experience when working in Windows land (I am both an iOS developer and a C# developer).  However, on booting to Windows the hard drive in resource management (listed as an APPLE HDD WDC WD10EALX-408EA0) goes into 100% usage for around 10 minutes before the computer is responsive to use. This is without loading additional applications, just loading into windows in the first place.  After the system has loaded, it is fast and responsive (i.e. no additional paging or anything). Does anyone know what the resolution for this is?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/P0IeD.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer200578> The solution to my particular problem is to be found here which suggests excluding the process MsMpEng.exe from the windows defender service. I'm running windows 8.1 so this done by searching for Windows Defender in your programs, clicking on the settings tab (far right) and then browsing to 'C:\Program Files\Windows Defender\MsMpEng.exe' and adding it to the excluded files and locations. Disk usage reduces drammatically!  <answer256407> i think you should increase virtual memory and unnecessary services which will solved your 100% disk usages problem try this video step by step https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzK9x_iV6M8  i hope it will solve your problem   <comment235610> Did it always do this from the first time you installed Windows or did this start later on?
