Fusion installing Mavericks this item is temporary unavailable <body> I am new to Mac. I have a MacBook Air running 10.9.4.  I installed Fusion VMWare and I am trying to install a VM for 10.9.4 using the "Install OS X from the recovery partition. When I get to the installation step that asks for my Apple Id, I log in and get this message: "This item is temporarily unavailable - Try again later".  Why???  Couple things to note: This Mac was passed down to me, I do not have a Mavericks installer and never purchased one.  <answer162533> The only 'official' way to get 10.9.x [which would actually be 10.9.5] is to have previously 'bought' it - it would then be in your previous purchases list on the App Store &amp; could be re-downloaded.   Alternatively, if that was the OS that was on the machine when new you can get it via Internet Recovery.  Otherwise, the only OS available to download will be Yosemite.  <answer182831> I was able to solve this problem by installing Mac OS X Mavericks installer.  First I download Mavericks installer from this link.  Then I made a bootable USB using disk utility. You can see how to do that in this video. If the link does not work, you can find the video on youtube by searching for: "how to burn OS X Lion to USB DVD".  Put a USB stick into your Mac (8 GB minimum) and go to Disk Utility. Make the USB bootable following these steps: select erase data, create a single partition, click options and choose the first option (GUID). After this, click on download OS X Mavericks files and than click Restore and select the downloaded OS X Mavericks file as source file and USB in destination. This will take some time.  Now, when you receive the error, put in the bootable USB stick with OS X and press command + R. Reinstall it install automatically.  <comment281070> I am not able to load Mavericks on a machine that originally came with it via the "Install OS X from the recovery partition". I get the same "Temporarily unavailable error" as above. Pretty sure it's permanently unavailable. <comment281134> The recovery partition should install the current OS that is on that partition. Internet Recovery will install the one the machine came with. <comment281258> When I tried to install from the recovery partition, it asked me for the iTunes login. After providing my iTunes login, I got the "item is temporarily unavailable" message. I have not been able to proceed. <comment281312> Ahhh... ***your*** ID... which I'm guessing was not the original ID that 'purchased' Mavericks in the first place - that's why it's not available, you never owned it. Did you not completely wipe & re-install the OS when you first got the machine? <comment282137> I'm not the OP, just giving more information. I *believe* in my case I was logging in with the Apple ID that was originally used to register the machine. <comment349239> @Tetsujin I'm having a similar issue.  How do you completely wipe and reinstall the OS?  I've deleted the partitions and recreated, and during reinstall (from recovery partition), I get the "blocked symbol" (circle with diagonal slash). Attempting internet recovery and entering my AppleID just brings me to the "this item is temporarily unavailable" error message.
