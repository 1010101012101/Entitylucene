How to not be asked for a password when modifying system files? <body> I constantly tinker with my system files and other whatnot, and it's a pain to literally type in a password every single time I edit a system file. I am the only user on my computer. Any way to do this?  <answer191748> There are a few ways to do so. You can either execute codesudo su/code or codesudo -i/code. This requires password once. Then you can issue any command without need of sudo (including modifying files). Or you can set a directory or file's permissions or owner by:  precodesudo chmod -R 777 /directory/file.txt /code/pre  This sets the permissions to read, write execute on the owning user, group and others.  precodesudo chown -R username:users /directory/file.txt /code/pre  You can make chown groups also. I am not sure how but the codegroupadd/code command is involved  <comment227796> Set perms for the enclosing folder & contents to include yourself(Me) as 'Read & Write' from Cmd/i Get Info
