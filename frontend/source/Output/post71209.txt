Problem with corrupt .rar file <body> I have a big file compressed in split code.rar/code archives. There are 68 archives named .rar, .r01, .r02, etc., annd the problem is that code.r36/code is corrupted resulting in an codeUnexpected end of archive/code. I've looked around and I have found nothing.  There is no way to repair the file.  And now my question is if it's possible to emskip/em the file. I mean, extract all files except the code.r36/code. The result should be a big file with a small part of it corrupted, but it doesn't matter.  Is that possible - to emskip/em a file from extraction? Because my main problem is that all the apps I've tried stop the task when they find the error.  <answer88717> If your archive comes with recovery files(.rev) you can regenerate missing or broken parts.   I use command line version of rar for this. Just execute this command: coderar e archive-name.r01/code. This will extract from all the parts and rebuild the broken ones.  Instead if you don't have rev files you can't do nothing. You can't just skip.   <comment103993> That was my conclusion some time ago. I mark your answer as correct ;)
