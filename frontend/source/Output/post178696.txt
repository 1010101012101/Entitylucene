VLC Player Staying On Top Of The Opened Applications On Desktop <body> I want my VLC player not to minimize while I am on the windows of other applications. Whenever I click another window the VLC player window will go behind the my currently clicked window but I want it to resist being on top.  <answer178697> VLC  Video menu  Float on top...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/c4iq4.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment324702> I believe this will only make VLC Float on Top when videos are playing. The application itself won't float on top, e.g. if audio files are played.
