Mac OSX - Transfer Connect to Server Favorites to new computer? <body> I have a new macbook pro that's on the company network. My old laptop had a large list of Connect to Server favorite locations that I don't have memorized.  Is there a way i can transfer this server favorites list to the new computer? If so how?
