Mac App Store shows OS X Lion installed after interrupted connection <body> I purchased Lion from the Mac App Store and for some reason my connection got cut, after that Mac App Store says that the app is INSTALLED when i can't see it anywhere.  I tried to check for unfinished downloads but it still says: INSTALLED  I should note that i'm on Lion GM and the installer was downloading in LaunchPad, but i can't see it anymore  i tried:  ul liRebuilding LaunchServices/li liLook for the installer/li /ul  Any idea? thanks  <answer18079> If you select any tab in the App Store except for purchase and hold the kbdoption/kbd key down when you select purchased, you can re-download the Lion installer.  Using spotlight may also reveal that you have the installer somewhere on the mac - even an external drive and might avoid the delay and bandwidth use to download the installer again.  <comment19767> where is that? holding the option key doesn't do anything on Mac App Store Purchased tab or the Mac OS X Lion tab <comment19772> In the App Store - I'm not at a Lion mac presently - but it should say installed instead of $29 http://cl.ly/8fuM <comment19774> nothing happens when i push hold option while clicking the installed button http://cl.ly/0j3P3U0c0N2S132Q0M3z <comment19777> found this: http://osxdaily.com/2011/07/20/install-lion-final-release-over-lion-gm/ ... thanks <comment19784> I'll incorporate that clarification in my answer. I didn't need to do that, but I have debug mode turned on. Perhaps my testing wasn't sufficient for everyone's needs. Big thanks for the feedback. <comment65860> Also off topic - we're not answering GM questions in general as they are not publicly available.
