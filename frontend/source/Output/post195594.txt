File name autocompletion stopped working in Terminal <body> I just noticed this.  Previously, when I typed codecd Doc&lt;tab&gt;/code I would get codecd Documents/code.  Now I get codecd Doc/code.  If I hit codetab/code again it just appends more tabs.  I only have one codeDoc*/code directory:  precode$ ls -d Doc* Documents/ /code/pre  Is there a way I can get this working again?  I believe it was working until recently.  I recently updated the command-line tools.  Could this have affected this?   I am on Yosemite on a Retina MacBook.  <comment233516> which Shell are you using? do you have several files/folders "Doc*", so that autocompletion does not know which to pick? <comment233535> Does hitting the `Tab` key a second time return a match? If so, you could have multiple matches. The Xcode command-line tools *should* impact the behaviour of your shell. <comment233561> @CML, I am using `/bin/sh`.  I had switched to it to do some testing.  Switching it back to `/bin/bash` fixes it.  Thanks!
