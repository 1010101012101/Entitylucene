Cannot setup two-factor authentication <body> I'm trying to set up 2FA on my iCloud account but I get this message:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ckh38.png" alt="enter image description here"  Any ideas on a solution? There's also no option in the security settings on my iPhone to enable it. I'm running the latest versions of iOS and macOS.  <answer253236> If you have enabled two-step-verification you need to disable it first.  Go to your AppleID website, login and edit the security section. Disable the two-step-verification.   If you're ready with that, you can try to enable the two-factor-authentication on your device.  AppleID Website: https://appleid.apple.com/#!&amp;page=signin  <answer255208> Had the same issue.  In my case I apparently missed/junked/deleted the verification email sent to me by Apple.  A call into support and they resent the email and I was good to go.  Before you call a quick search of your email for appleid@id.apple.com might save you some time.  Hope this helps.  <comment315154> The OP states he's running the latest OS versions on both Mac and iPhone so how does this answer the question? <comment315156> Where you running a beta OS on either devices prior to updating to the latest versions?  I've seen people have problems if they where running a beta.  Also, try changing your Apple ID security questions and make sure you have a credit card on your account (Apple uses that to verify identity). <comment315168> misreading the OP's questions :( . I've correct my answer. <comment315172> Is the option available to you at id.apple.com? Do you have any old devices listed there?
