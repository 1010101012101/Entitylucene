My mail icon is not showing anything <body> I was in the middle of writing an email and pasting a photo into the email when everything disappeared and all I have is a white screen. No choice of mailbox etc displaying. Have tried shutting down the iPad and restarting three times. Still no mail.  <comment258569> Did you try specifically killing the app? Double click Home & slide the app up off the screen.
