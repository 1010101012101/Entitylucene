Internal Speakers/Headphones muted after Yosemite upgrade <body> After upgrading my Macbook Air (early 2014) to Yosemite, audio is not heard neither via internal speakers nor headphones.  When I upgraded, external display was connected to USB/Tunderbolt ports.  if  System Preferences  Sound  Output   setting is either  Headphones (when these are plugged in) or Internal Speakers (when not)  then there is no sound from Headphones/int. speakers  If it is  Display Audio, display speakers work.  No red light, when audio is playing and internal speakers are selected as output. I already cleaned output and restarted it several times. No help.    <comment289368> I have the same problem! Did you solve it?
