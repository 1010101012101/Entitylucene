Look up won't show wikipedia-only definitions <body> Have this problem strongonly/strong since upgraded to Sierra.  3finger tap, CTRL-CMD-D, whatever will happily show definitions of a word - as long as it is in one of the OTHER dictionaries installed (in my case: English, English thesaurus, French), but if the term strongonly/strong appears in wikipedia, "no results found" will show. Wikipedia only terms: Names, Acronyms, places... When opening the Dictionary application, and typing in the term, the results do show, as seen in the image.img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pDaVU.png" alt="enter image description here"   Switched computers (MBP 2010 first, so no force-click support, and now MBP 2015) with no change in behavior. Trackpad prefs changes didn't do anything. deinstalling wikipedia from the Dictionary prefs, then reinstalling, didn't change the behavior either.img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/X8AeN.png" alt="enter image description here"
