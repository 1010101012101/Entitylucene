AppleScript - more than title <body> I have a AppleScript that runs from a cron job. The script is:  precodetell application "System Events" set frontApp to name of first application process whose frontmost is true end tell tell application frontApp if the (count of windows) is not 0 then     set window_name to name of front window end if end tell /code/pre  (which I got from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/480866/get-the-title-of-the-current-active-window-document-in-mac-os-x in an example of one of many instances where SO has had the answer to a query ready for me)   I use the script to populate a file like this   l  precode2013-08-07_20:55:04convert - Linux Command - Unix Command 2013-08-07_20:56:05matlab graph colors.... - Stack Overflow 2013-08-07_20:57:06matlab graph colors.... - Stack Overflow 2013-08-07_20:58:07matlab graph colors.... - Stack Overflow 2013-08-07_20:59:08matlab graph colors.... - Stack Overflow 2013-08-07_21:00:10printing - Save MATLAB figure with different background color - Stack Overflow 2013-08-07_21:01:11matlab graph colors.... - Stack Overflow 2013-08-07_21:02:12Changing matlab b - Stack Overflow 2013-08-07_21:03:162013-08-07_21:04:17/Users/josephreddington/Downloads /code/pre  to keep track of my time.  It works well but I have issues like - all I'm getting from the Apple Script is the title of the window i.e.   precodematlab graph colors.... - Stack Overflow /code/pre  Whereas what I'd like is a little more information, like active application (Chrome) in this instance - can someone point me in the direction of either a) how to modify the script so that I get the application name as well as the window title, or b) where I find a handy API that tells me how to do a)   Cheers,  <answer98365> This looks like what you are looking for:  precodeset app_name to name of (info for (path to frontmost application)) /code/pre  <answer98407> precodetell application "System Events" to tell (process 1 where frontmost is true)     set o to name     try         set o to o &amp; ":" &amp; name of window 1     end try     o end tell /code/pre  <comment115442> Can you include the whole script in your question? <comment115462> That is the whole script - I've got a wrapper in bash that adds the datestamp and writes to file, but that's it... <comment115508> `info for` has been deprecated in favor of `tell app "System Events" to properties of`. <comment197897> This will need need `assistive access` to the executing script <comment313990> @Joe. I am doing something similar but the i am a facing a issue wherein when i minimise my active window i keep on getting details of the minimised window. Did you face any such problem with the script ?
