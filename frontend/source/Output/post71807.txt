Booting from USB to install Windows 7 on Macbook Pro, Early 2011 <body> I used Bootcamp (5.0) to create a Windows 7 install USB. It successfully created the install USB but when I reboot the system and hold down the option-key to boot from the USB drive, the boot-loader doesn't give me the option of booting from USB.   I also tried recreating the install USB from another Windows 7 machine using Microsoft's own Windows 7 USB creation tool but I still don't get the option of booting from USB on my mac.br What am I doing wrong here? Any Ideas?  <answer72113> You need to format the USB drive to use the GUID partition type -- use the Disk Utility on your Mac.  source Apple support docs  <answer79896> As far as I know, if your mac still has an optical drive, you are forced to boot Windows from a DVD (and won't be able to boot it up from the USB).  <comment83779> Do you have to do it manually? From experience, I just had to create the disk, and Boot Camp automatically rebooted to the drive. <comment122311> Do you have anything to support this? <comment122312> Have a look at http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/62700/49601
