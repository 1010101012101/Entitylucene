Operation not permitted "sudo ditto -v to folder /usr/bin" <body> I'm trying to copy an exec file from my downloads folder to /usr/bin/ using codesudo ditto -v sweep /usr/bin/sweep/code, but the command always fails in Terminal. I even tried to manually drag and drop it but the folder only has permissions for the system account. Is there a way I can change my command to allow permissions to this folder so that I can copy the file?.  I'm using OS X 10.11.1  <answer213386> The folder /usr/bin/ is (like other system folders in El Capitan) protected by SIP (System Integrity Protection).  You may either boot to Recovery Mode, disable System Integrity Protection with codecsrutil disable/code entered in Terminal.app and after rebooting copy the executable or use the folder /usr/local/bin instead. You may have to adjust your path in the latter case.
