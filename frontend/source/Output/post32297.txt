How can I reassign the copy/paste keyboard shortcuts? <body> I've been using mac for years, but prefer to do software development on windows. I'm really used to is using the folowing shortcuts on windows very much:  precode&lt;CTRL&gt;  + INSERT: Copy &lt;SHIFT&gt; + INSERT: Paste &lt;SHIFT&gt; + DELETE: Cut /code/pre  Of late, I've taken to doing even my development work on the Mac. However, as a matter of habit, I'm missing these shortcuts very much. Actually, I find these a lot more convenient than COMMAND + (C/V/X) combo.  Is there a way to reassign these three shortcuts at least?   I've look all over the internet and in the "Keyboards" system preferences but I did not find anything.  PS: If you're wondering where I find the INSERT keys on a mac book pro, I use a wireless keyboard.  <answer32314> Try creating code~/Library/KeyBindings//code and saving a property list like this as DefaultKeyBinding.dict:  precode{     "^\UF727" = copy:; // control-insert     "$\UF727" = paste:; // shift-insert     "^\UF728" = cut:; // control-delete } /code/pre  I don't have a keyboard with an insert key, so I couldn't test if the first two settings work. The last setting works for me though.  Edit: another option is to use Karabiner (formerly KeyRemap4MacBook):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LABx7.png" alt=""  precode&lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::PC_INSERT, VK_CONTROL | Modifierflag::NONE KeyCode::C, ModifierFlag::COMMAND_L&lt;/autogen&gt; &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::PC_INSERT, VK_SHIFT | Modifierflag::NONE, KeyCode::V, ModifierFlag::COMMAND_L&lt;/autogen&gt; &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::FORWARD_DELETE, VK_SHIFT | Modifierflag::NONE, KeyCode::X, ModifierFlag::COMMAND_L&lt;/autogen&gt; /code/pre  <answer36612> codeSystem Preferences -&gt; Keyboard -&gt; Keyboard Shortcuts/code  You can change (or assign) several hotkeys by finding in the list and then clicking on the key assigned and then typing the new one to replace.   To replace (for example) a "copy" operation in a specific program add an entry for the program in you are using (or for all programs). In the menu title box, type EXACTLY the menu text of the item i (e.g. Copy) as the text. Restart the application and click on the menu item within the program, you will find that this has been replaced with your custom shortcut   <answer36633> precodeSystem Preferences: Keyboard: Modifier Keys... /code/pre  Then swap the Command and Control keys. This will change everything globally for all keyboard commands system-wide.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RSkiy.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer96196> I use Ctrl-Ins, Shift-Ins, etc too.  The solution described is here, as well as remapping Home and End keys to be more Windows-like, e.g.     ul   liOpen TextEdit under the Applications folder.  If TextEdit was already open, create a new document using File-New.  There should be   a window labeled 'Untitled'./li   liSelect the text within the window below, copy it, and then paste it into your new TextEdit window./li   liIn TextEdit, convert this to plain text (the default is rich text) by selecting Format-Make Plain Text./li   liNext, select File-Save As...  In the "Save As" dialog box, navigate to your home directory (look under PLACES on the left side for a house   picture that has your name next to it).  In your home directory,   double-click on the Library folder.  If you see a KeyBindings folder   then double-click on it.  If not, then click on "New Folder" (within   the Library directory), name the new folder KeyBindings (with no   space), and then double-click on it.  Type DefaultKeyBinding.dict for   the filename (at the top) and then click Save./li   liWarning:  TextEdit will sometimes try to 'help' you by appending a .txt extension to the filename.  Make sure this doesn't happen.  If   asked to use a .txt extension, tell TextEdit to instead use .dict.  It   will not work if you use .txt.  If you have trouble, see comment by   Nathan below./li   liBefore these changes take effect, you need to log out and then log back in./li   /ul   The code to paste into code~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict/code file is this one:  precode/* ~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.Dict This file remaps the key bindings of a single user on Mac OS X 10.5 to more closely match default behavior on Windows systems.  This particular mapping assumes that you have also switched the Control and Command keys already.  This key mapping is more appropriate after switching Ctrl for Command in this menu: Apple-&gt;System Preferences-&gt;Keyboard &amp; Mouse-&gt;Keyboard-&gt;Modifier Keys...-&gt; Change Control Key to Command Change Command key to Control This applies to OS X 10.5 and possibly other versions.  Here is a rough cheatsheet for syntax.

It doesn't seem to work. Guess I'll have to get used to mac clipboard shortcuts. Thanks much. I'll try and read up on the links. First look, I didn't  understand most of the things in these links :) <comment92664> Any way to make command+left or command+right go one word left or one word right instead of home and end? <comment138762> Created an account just to mod this up. KeyRemap4MacBook finally made me able to use ctrl/shift+ins/del on mac, this has really made my coding so much faster. I've dabbled with DoubleCommand, custom keymaps etc but this one just worked right out of the box. <comment211246> This doesn't work very well in some apps such as Finder. The problem is that sometimes the Menu item is named "Copy 6 items" or Copy file.txt, and then it doesn't work <comment221837> How do you figure out the names for shortcuts? where can i see all available ones? because in my os there is only show help menu and nothing more... no autocomplete on new shortcut dialog <comment221838> for copy paste its logical but for example CTRL + Back i dont know the name and want to change it to Command + Back <comment259764> External links can go away. Please relate the most relevant contents here in your answer so the answer will always be here, and the link can serve for deeper research. <comment259953> Ha, I forgot I even wrote this answer. I've probably repaved my Mac 5 times since I wrote it, and got used to the Mac shortcuts years ago. <comment264275> I really wish there was a poll somewhere of mac users who actually make this switch. <comment285978> This also messes up our dear ALT-TAB ! <comment311588> How is this answering SHIFT + INSERT: Paste ? <comment314489> Related: [Remap Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V, and Ctrl-X only](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/66970/22781) <comment327369> @Arne Sadly the application stopped working with Sierra update.  The KeyBindings file approach has never worked for me.
