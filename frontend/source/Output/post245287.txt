How can I install es_AR locale on OSX El Capitan? <body> I'm trying to install a locale on OSX (El Capitan) and I can't figure it out.  I've been googling for hours now.  In Ubuntu is as simple as codelocale-gen/code and codedpkg-reconfigure/code.  I'm coding a PHP application that uses codees_AR/code as a locale and I can't get my number formatting right.  Works fine in Linux systems.  precode$ locale -a | grep es es_ES es_ES.ISO8859-1 es_ES.ISO8859-15 es_ES.UTF-8 /code/pre  <answer245288> You would set that up in the emLanguages and Region/em setting in emSystem Preferences/em  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Vjn0Q.png" alt="enter image description here"  Under the advanced tab, you can set your number formatting  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/p5Sjv.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer245293> I'm not sure if you can set it up. As you have self figured out, OS X doesn't care much for countries in Latin America and out them all together.  However, as what you need is to test your PHP application, you can check this post out. There are some steps you can do to force the locale.  There is otherwise the ability of the web browser to emulate another locale that the one of the OS. You should check the documentation of your browser, most of them have developer tools which can be useful. Another option is to look for some browser plugin.  <comment302372> Hi Allan! I only see "Spanish", "Spanish (México)" and "Spanish (Latin América)" but I need "Spanish (Argentina)" <comment302378> Wouldn't that be Spanish (Latin America) then? <comment302380> Nop. If I run `locale -a` on my terminal I don't see `es_AR` listed. <comment302381> What I mean is es_AR is covered under the Spanish (Latin America) locale? <comment304508> In Linux/Unix and Mac es_AR is really the exact same as the es_ES and es_419 locales. See my answer on SO [here](http://stackoverflow.com/a/38338064/1861357). <comment348768> From what I can tell, _no_ language+region you install via System Preferences installs a corresponding underlying _Unix_ locale (as would be reflected in `locale -a`).
