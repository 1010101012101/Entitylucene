Setting up Microsoft Exchange on Mac <body> I can't configure my business MS Exchange on my Mac although I can with the same settings on my iPhone and iPad. Do I need to configure something more of bypass some kind of setting or something like that?br Communicator isn't working as well, so that's why I think it's about a general Mac problem configuring my Exchange account...  strongEDIT/strong: I try to connect with MS Outlook for Mac 2011. Is Mail Lion 100% compatible with Exchange?  <comment33722> Can you please extend your question to provide more information? With which mail application are you trying to access the Exchange server? How did you configure it (screenshots might help), which problem do you run into? <comment33724> Ok, my bad. I'll post screenshots in a few hours when I got access to my Mac again. <comment33726> Also add in any errors you receive, there are a lot of possibilities for things going wrong when setting up an account. Are they all on the same network? What version of exchange do you use? <comment33731> How can I check my Exchange version? <comment33739> Does your company offer webmail through Exchange? Go to the webmail site, on the login screen, it should say what version you have. You need at least Exchange 2007 to work with Lion or Outlook 2011. <comment33742> There is a webmail, but no info on the login screen. It works with my iPad/iPhone, so I assume the Exchange version is at least 2007 since these devices work with iOS4 and 5...
