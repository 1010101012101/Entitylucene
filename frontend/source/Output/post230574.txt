Accidentally granted myself all directories on my mac <body> so I was working late last week and accidentally granted my user the ownership of all the files on my mac, with this command I think:  precodesudo chown -R / /code/pre  I have been fixing it to make apache, sudoers, and more programs and configurations but there are a lot of things I haven't been able to fix (mysql, brew, etc.)  Is there a way to "reset" permissions to default on my mac? I have tried going into recovery mode and reinstalling the system but as I have a slow strongand/strong unstable connection, it always fails.  I'm under El Capitan version 10.11.3.  Thanks!  <comment281438> Restore the files from your latest backup. <comment281439> Thanks @techraf, I have been trying to. But bin, Library, sbin, System and usr cannot be replaced as they are being used by the system. Is there a way I can mount my backup on recovery mode? <comment281441> Luckily you are on El Capitan and SIP did not allow you to modify permissions on `/System`, `/bin`, `/sbin`, etc. so you don't need to restore them, right? <comment281561> Just a thought as I have not tried this but can you boot into recovery mode (Command-R) select Disk Utility and repair permissions? Not sure if that will fix something like this but it should only take a few minutes to try it out.
