Combine powerpoint presentations without changing template/background? <body> I have multiple powerpoint presentations that need to be combined into a single presentation. They have different templates/background slides. This seems to be rather straightforward to do on Windows, but I can't find any online documentation for how to do this on a Mac.  <answer260278>    Unfortunately, this feature is not currently available in PowerPoint 2016 for Mac.
