How to automatically switch to English when I switch to particular application? <body> I use 3 languages intensively on my iMac - English, Ukrainian and Russian. In some applications, however, I'd like the input to be automatically changed to a particular language.  For example, in software development applications, in console and in launchpad, I'd like to always get English turned on automatically.  Are there any ways to configure this?  <answer180738> Go to Settings - Keyboard and select the rightmost tab (Sorry only got German Os X at the moment, so I do not know the exact english words which will be displayed).  At the bottom there is a checkbox (the label is something with automatic change input source for documents ...) - check it. Now you have to select the language for every document at first. But every time you switch back OS X will change the keyboard layout.
