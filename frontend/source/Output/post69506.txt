Finder window file view header looks odd - fix? <body> I think I set this up some time ago and it looks like a search or something but I want it to just be like my apps folder where I can sort. My mistake but very unintuitive how to remove this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Eoi8h.png" alt="bad"  and make it look like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WgXqF.png" alt="enter image description here"  How do I remove thhat so it works like my applications folder?  <answer69507> Click on the "arrange" button on your Finder toolbar, then choose "none".  I agree that this is quite unintuitive.   <comment80737> thx, fixed it well (have to wait a few minutes to accept)
