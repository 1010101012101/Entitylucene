The iTunes currently-playing track is blank; how do I get it back? <body> I'm using iTunes 11.1.2 on the Mac. The top center of iTunes has an area that normally shows the currently-playing track (title, artist, album, etc.) with the track time slider. (Apparently this is called the "scrubber".)  After a recent Software Update, that area is now empty; it just has the Apple logo. I can't find any way to make the track data and time slider appear again (clicking and right-clicking does nothing, the View menu doesn't have an option for this, etc.).  How can I get this to reappear?  <answer108784> Apparently a lot of people are seeing this problem. Poster "musicelect" on this Apple discussion thread at least provided a work-around:  ol liClose the main iTunes window with kbd⌘/kbd+kbdW/kbd/li liThen reopen it with kbd⌘/kbd+kbdOpt/kbd+kbd1/kbd/li /ol
