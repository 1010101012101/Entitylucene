SSH Client not working? <body> When I connect through SSH to my server via SSH, I am seeing something like this:   precodeasd:/Users/asd () $ ssh root@47.52.32.36 Password for root@iZj6cdolljnt77ccercqzsZ: &lt;hangs for a while&gt; packet_write_wait: Connection to 47.52.32.36 port 22: Broken pipe /code/pre  I thought this could be an issue with my SSH client so I downloaded vSSH client and was able to connect!   I've tried connecting via the ssh client on Terminal.app and iTerm.app but both times they seem to hang before reporting that there is a broken pipe.   How can I go about debugging why my SSH client is not connecting but vSSH is?   strongEDIT/strong  This is my version: OpenSSH_7.3p1, LibreSSL 2.4.1  And this is the -v info:  precodevng:/Users/vng () $ ssh root@47.52.32.36 Password for root@iZj6cdolljnt77ccercqzsZ: packet_write_wait: Connection to 47.52.32.36 port 22: Broken pipe vng:/Users/vng () $ ssh -v root@47.52.32.36 OpenSSH_7.3p1, LibreSSL 2.4.1 debug1: Reading configuration data /etc/ssh/ssh_config debug1: /etc/ssh/ssh_config line 20: Applying options for * debug1: Connecting to 47.52.32.36 [47.52.32.36] port 22. debug1: Connection established. debug1: identity file /Users/vng/.ssh/id_rsa type 1 debug1: key_load_public: No such file or directory debug1: identity file /Users/vng/.ssh/id_rsa-cert type -1 debug1: key_load_public: No such file or directory debug1: identity file /Users/vng/.ssh/id_dsa type -1 debug1: key_load_public: No such file or directory debug1: identity file /Users/vng/.ssh/id_dsa-cert type -1 debug1: key_load_public: No such file or directory debug1: identity file /Users/vng/.ssh/id_ecdsa type -1 debug1: key_load_public: No such file or directory debug1: identity file /Users/vng/.ssh/id_ecdsa-cert type -1 debug1: key_load_public: No such file or directory debug1: identity file /Users/vng/.ssh/id_ed25519 type -1 debug1: key_load_public: No such file or directory debug1: identity file /Users/vng/.ssh/id_ed25519-cert type -1 debug1: Enabling compatibility mode for protocol 2.0 debug1: Local version string SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_7.3 debug1: Remote protocol version 2.0, remote software version OpenSSH_6.6.1_hpn13v11 FreeBSD-20140420 debug1: match: OpenSSH_6.6.1_hpn13v11 FreeBSD-20140420 pat OpenSSH_6.6.1* compat 0x04000000 debug1: Authenticating to 47.52.32.36:22 as 'root' debug1: SSH2_MSG_KEXINIT sent debug1: SSH2_MSG_KEXINIT received debug1: kex: algorithm: curve25519-sha256@libssh.org debug1: kex: host key algorithm: ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 debug1: kex: server-&gt;client cipher: chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com MAC: &lt;implicit&gt; compression: none debug1: kex: client-&gt;server cipher: chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com MAC: &lt;implicit&gt; compression: none debug1: expecting SSH2_MSG_KEX_ECDH_REPLY debug1: Server host key: ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 SHA256:1/YIGlOXCfpqFM+0btV0zmALuc2JPVYgZ9aBGOn+KQE debug1: Host '47.52.32.36' is known and matches the ECDSA host key. debug1: Found key in /Users/vng/.ssh/known_hosts:60 debug1: rekey after 134217728 blocks debug1: SSH2_MSG_NEWKEYS sent debug1: expecting SSH2_MSG_NEWKEYS debug1: rekey after 134217728 blocks debug1: SSH2_MSG_NEWKEYS received debug1: SSH2_MSG_SERVICE_ACCEPT received debug1: Authentications that can continue: publickey,password,keyboard-interactive debug1: Next authentication method: publickey debug1: Offering RSA public key: /Users/vng/.ssh/id_rsa debug1: Authentications that can continue: publickey,password,keyboard-interactive debug1: Trying private key: /Users/vng/.ssh/id_dsa debug1: Trying private key: /Users/vng/.ssh/id_ecdsa debug1: Trying private key: /Users/vng/.ssh/id_ed25519 debug1: Next authentication method: keyboard-interactive Password for root@iZj6cdolljnt77ccercqzsZ: debug1: Authentications that can continue: publickey,password,keyboard-interactive Password for root@iZj6cdolljnt77ccercqzsZ: debug1: Authentication succeeded (keyboard-interactive).

Also, many systems do not allow a root user to log in remotely; try with a different account.  Finally, issue the command with `-v` (lowercase v) to get *verbose* output of what's happening during the connection process. <comment351228> Adding this to which file exactly? And what does it do?
