Change Default Calendar on Apple Watch <body> When I use Siri to create appointments on my Apple Watch, it gets dropped in my iCloud calendar. Is there a way to have this go to a different calendar? On iOS, you can find this in settings, but the watch doesn't seem to honor the setting.   <comment267776> Won't it honor what you have set on your iPhone's Settings - Mail, Contacts, and Calendars - Default Calendar? <comment267778> It would appear not <comment267781> Interesting. Default calendar should be automatically synced but it is one thing that isn't listed under My Watch - Calendars. I'm not sure what to make of that.
