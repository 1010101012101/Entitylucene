Hosts file being reset after every reboot <body> My code/private/etc/hosts/code file is being reset after every reboot. I can make my changes, save the file, and it will work. Right up until I reboot my Mac. Has anyone found a work around for this or a way to prevent it from happening?  I'm running OSX Yosemite 10.10.4.  UPDATE: It was my VPN Client, Cisco AnyConnect. See comments for solution.  <answer197915> You have two choices.  One is stop using Cisco AnyConnect -not a solution just a choice.  The other is just use the Cisco AnyConnect host file and modify it with your modifications, since it will will overwrite your /private/etc/host.  Cisco host file:     /private/etc/hosts.ac  <comment236463> hmmm. it should not do that. What is it rewritten to (the original?) do you use the "Cisco AnyConnect " <comment236698> Buscar, you are correct. I am using the Cisco AnyConnect. I just noticed my file was reset about ten minutes ago, and connected it to my VPN software. Now to figure out why. <comment236700> I was able to fix this issue with this link: http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20111011050950471 Buscar, Why don't you post this and the any connect info as an answer and I will accept it. Thanks! <comment236952> you are welcome....
