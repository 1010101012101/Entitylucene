mount an unmountable drive <body> I have a MacBook Pro with a root mounting sector with problems. It becomes like this due to password changing in safe mode. Now of course it doesn't turn up any more. I tried repair with disk utility I tried CMD+R using terminal I tried several reparing softwares to save data  All without any success. Any idea at least how to save data?  Thanks  <answer89606> Use testdisk. (Freeware, http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk)  I've once had a disk that could not be read by the system nor anything. I just ran testdisk and was able to recover all of the data on the disk.  <comment105260> After trying more than 10 different software. I did it, unfortunately I didn't find your software. I want to thank you anyway. I used data rescue and I saved everything.
