open image full screen with "open -a Preview" <body> Using osx 10.9.3  I would like to write a script that opens images full-screen with preview but I can't seem to find the command line options for the Preview application.  <answer134408> Preview.app doesn't have command line options, but you could use AppleScript in Terminal:  precodeopen -a Preview somefile.png ; /usr/bin/osascript -e 'tell application "Preview"' -e "activate" -e 'tell application "System Events"' -e 'keystroke "f" using {control down, command down}' -e "end tell" -e "end tell" /code/pre  Just replace codesomefile.png/code with the path/image you want; AppleScript invokes fullscreen.  <comment159068> this is nice but can you make it as variable for file names so it has not to be done manually each time <comment159073> Are you meaning `f=$"somefile.png" ; open -a Preview $f ...`?
