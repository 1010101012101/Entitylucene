iPod 3rd Generation--Music is erased when disconnected from computer <body> Anytime I connect my iPod to my computer, load music from my iTunes library, and disconnect my iPod, all of my music and videos are erased. My iPod works fine when it connects to my sister's computer, but the second I try to add and disconnect my iPod from my own computer, everything on the iPod vanishes. What gives?!
