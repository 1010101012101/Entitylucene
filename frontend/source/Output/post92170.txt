apple tv ssh script automation <body> I have a Apple TV 2nd generation that is jailbroken and I run xbmc on it. At times it gets hung or freezes up. At that point, I open up the terminal on my macbook and run this script. ssh root@apple-tv.local it asks me the password. I type in alpine then I run "killall AppleTV"  Is there any way to make this a one click operation, like a desktop icon that achieves the same result? Maybe an Apple Script or a Automator workflow? Any ideas please?  <answer92171> you could codessh root@apple-tv.local killall AppleTV/code, also you might want to change your passwd from the default. As for a icon, you could but the above into a file and name it with a code.sh/code extention, which could then be 'clicked on'.  If you don't want to be prompted for a ssh passwd, set up some ssh keys.  h3Setting up ssh keys/h3  If you already have a key on your computer, skip to step 2  ol licodessh-keygen -t rsa/code and follow the the prompts. If you use a passphrase, you'll want to set up ssh-agent./li liCopy contents of code~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub/code to code~/.ssh/authorized_keys/code on the tv./li licodechmod go-rwx ~/.ssh/authorized_keys/code/li /ol  This is just a quick example, check out this wiki for more.  <comment108157> Thanks.
