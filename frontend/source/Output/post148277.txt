Save my Clash of Clans village to Game Center <body> My son was playing Clash of Clans on my iPhone in my Game Center. I then started playing it but never saved it to my Game Center and now it says if I want to save it I  will have to go to his level. I transferred his to his iPod.  My question is how can I save mine to my Game Center now without going backwards to his village ?  <answer148308> I'm sorry, you can't.. Clash of Clans allows you to have 1 village per Game Center account. And they don't allow you to reset your village. The only thing you can do is creating a new Game Center account with another Apple ID.. br/ br/ Source Supercell Game Support
