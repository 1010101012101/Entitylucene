Set an alert for an event in a subscribed calendar in iCal <body> My meetup.com account allows me to subscribe to an iCal calendar that displays all meetups that I have RSVP'd "yes" to.  All of the events appear as expected, but none of them have an alert setting (e.g., display message 2 hours before).  Is there a way to set an alert for events in a read-only subscribed calendar?  <answer48040> You can Control click on the calendar in iCal and go to Get Info and enable 'Ignore Alerts'. I'm not sure if this preference syncs with the iPhone too, but it certainly works on the Mac.  <answer48090> I don't believe it's possible to add data/information to a subscribed .ics calendar. I've tried to make it work here using a calendar I'm subscribed to and my only option is to view the event.  Even if I try to delete an individual event within the subscribed .ics calendar I'm presented with a dialog saying emYou can't change items in calendars you subscribe to./em  If you are sent an eminvite/em by someone then you can set an alert for that event.  If Meetup.com allows you to set an alert in the subscribed calendar that may be your only option.  <answer48093> My workaround, annoying as it is, is to emcopy/em the subscribed event to my main calendar and set my alerts from the copy.   <comment54968> Possibly related:  http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/30688/5118 <comment54969> Possibly related: http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/3325/5118 <comment55004> He's looking for a way to *add* an alert to a subscribed calendar event, not a way to disable all alerts for the calendar. <comment55115> Well, isn't that as simple as making sure that 'Ignore Alerts' is disabled? <comment55139> That's wrong on two and a half levels: 1) you refer to enabling "Ignore Alerts", not disabling it. 1.5) The events would need to already have alerts, which they don't. 2.5) He's *subscribed* to it, so he can't add an alert with the native method. <comment122663> Very annoying! But apparently the only workable solution :S
