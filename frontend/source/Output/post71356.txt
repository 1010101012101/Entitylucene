Which wifi repeater to buy that can be OS X configured? <body> I need to extend my Wi-Fi and would like the type that just plugs into the mains.  I cannot find a repeater or extender that does not use Windows to configure.  Is there a repeater or extender which can be configured with OS X?  <answer71395> You can use Apple's AirPort Express to extend wireless networks. This can be configured from AirPort Utility in OS X.  <comment82901> Are you looking for a powerline adapter? I don't think I've ever seen one that required Windows, or any other specific operating system.  They usually set up automatically and don't need to be connected to a computer at all. <comment82923> In my experience it only really seems to work (for extending, not bridging) with other Apple routers. Just something to think about. <comment83232> The AirPort devices can be configured as a bridge, at least it was possible March 2007. That is when I have setup AirPort devices to bridge the network of 5 river ships with an office. I haven't worked with AirPort Express.
