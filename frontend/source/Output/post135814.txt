Remove OSX shortcut to switch between spaces (ctrl + number shortcut) <body> On MacOsX Lion (upgrade from Leopard). Working with some 3d application, I would like to temporarily turn off the shortcut kbdctrl/kbd + kbd[numberOfSpace]/kbd.   I went to:  precode Preferences &gt; Keyboard &gt; Mission Control  /code/pre  and unchecked every checkbox; However, the shortcut is still active. I cannot find the place where it's defined. I also tried   precodePreferences &gt; Mission Control  /code/pre  and unchecked all checkboxes in the bottom section, but the shortcut still works. Is there a way to set/unset those shortcuts ?  <answer135852> Please check and uncheck accordingly   Go to strongSystem Preferences/strong  strongKeyboard/strong  strongShortcuts/strong  strongMission Control/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Aqhbd.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment161024> which key is the numberOfSpaces ? <comment161030> Just to be clear, you've unchecked all of the boxes in [this](http://i.stack.imgur.com/yjjcw.png) picture? <comment161037> @shub yes, I unchecked them all, Buscarì›ƒ it is ^1, ^2, ^3, ^4, ... <comment161041> That's quite weird because it should realy disable the shortcut... <comment161267> Thanks for the post, but I already did that, and I even unchecked every checkboxes on the right section, but I can still navigate with ctrl + 1, ctrl + 2, ... <comment161277> @ling Can you try [this](http://stackoverflow.com/a/18765462/3541881)? It should override the controls. Although it is odd that System Prefs doesn't work... <comment161498> @shub I've checked the ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.symbolichotkeys.plist file: the 118, 119 and 120 codes (which represents the ctrl + 1, ctrl + 2 and ctrl + 3 shortcuts according to this: http://hintsforums.macworld.com/archive/index.php/t-114785.html) were already disabled, but I still can navigate through the spaces with those shortcuts !!
