Force Bootcamp 6.0 to use the new ISO Windows installation without USB stick <body> It is now possible to install Windows directly with an ISO since OSX El Capitan release : https://help.apple.com/bootcamp/assistant/6.0/#/bcmp173b3bf2. We no longer need to have a USB stick or a superdrive.  However, in my case (Macbook Pro early 2011 without superdrive), I can't see this proposition, I only have the old way.  I know it was possible to force the system to do a USB stick OSX installation by changing the plist.info. Can we do the same to enable this new functionality on old Macbook Pro ?  I try to install Windows 10.  <comment251827> As far as I can tell, that machines is not supported in Boot Camp 6. It would help to know what version of Windows you are trying to install too. <comment251977> Yes, I think that my laptop is not supported, but maybe we can change an information to force the functionality, as I had to do to make a windows installation USB stick.  I try to install windows 10.
