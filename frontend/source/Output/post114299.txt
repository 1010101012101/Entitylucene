Opening Terminal shows a list of ttys - unable to use <body> Having the latest Mavericks installed, I tried to update codePATH/code using nano and creating a code.bash_profile/code file. I'm not sure what happened, but now when trying to run Terminal all that shows is a list of codettys000/code messages followed by a codewtmp begins/code message.  And finally says:  precode-bash:&lt;computername&gt;:~: command not found  [Process completed] /code/pre  I've downloaded a program to find hidden files but there's no sign of the code.bash_profile/code file.  Any ideas how to rescue the Terminal program?  <answer205315> You can run Bash with all startup scripts disabled to get around problems with startup scripts: choose strongShell  New Command/strong and run codebash --noprofile/code.  See the Bash man page for more information about the Bash command-line options and startup files: x-man-page://1/bash  Also note that you can lookup and view man pages in Terminal even when your shell isn't working, by clicking on the Help menu and entering a topic in the search field. Terminal will display matching man pages. Choose one from the Help menu to view it in a new window. You can also open an codex-man-page:/code scheme URL from any application.  <comment133948> Hours of searching, posted this question, found out what to do almost immediately.....as per this post http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13081058/cant-use-terminal-from-error-in-bash-profile <comment133949> Well, that's fairly common. No worries. You can answer your own question and mark it as accepted.
