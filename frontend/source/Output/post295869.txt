Numbers: Is it possible to import animated gifs? <body> I wanted to know if there is any chance to run an animated gif or somekind of video within a numbers table?  <answer295873> Yes on macOS you can add movies and animated gifs into a Numbers table. By simply drag and drop movies and/or animated gifs into Numbers.     I dropped it next to the table. After it was imported I positioned it on top of the right cell. Not in the cell but on top of the cell.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wl1xS.png" alt="GIF in Numbers"  <comment373661> thanks, I tried that before, but dragged the image into a table cell. This forces the image to become a cell fill automatically. Is there any chance to put that media into a table cell but keep it an interactive media? <comment373662> I dropped it next to the table.
