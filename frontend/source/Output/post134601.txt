Chrome showing the site's security certificate is not trusted for GitHub <body> Today, out of no-where Chrome just started showing invalid SSL certificate errors for popular sites like Github, Stripe, etc.  precodeThe site's security certificate is not trusted! /code/pre  I know the SSL certificates are valid, because my iMac on the same network works just fine.  I've cleared all cached and settings. Reinstalled chrome to the latest version. Checked that date/time set to automatically update in OSX.  Honestly, not sure what is going on.  <answer134606> I had this same problem. Open Keychain Access in ApplicationsUtilities. Make sure the selected keychain (top left) is login and the category (middle to bottom left) is certificates. Right click on any certificates labeled DigiCert and delete them.
