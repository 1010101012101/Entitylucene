How to set default finder window size? <body> How do I set the default size of my finder window to a size of my choice? Currently each time I open a finder window, it opens up in a very small size and I have to adjust it before I can start looking for my files. I'm running Yosemite.  <answer175889> Open a folder in list or cover flow view. Then press kbdcmd/kbd+kbdJ/kbd. Now hold kbdoption/kbd key and press codeReturn to default/code button at the bottom. New finder windows will be opened normally. You can try deleting code.DS_Store/code file in folders with false view.  <answer192959> It is very easy to do this:  ol liOpen a new Finder window./li liAs you resize the window, hold the kbdCommand âŒ˜/kbd (not kbdAlt/kbd / kbdOption/kbd) key.

Close all finder windows and next time you open a new one it will remember the size.  <comment232663> Does not work when opening shared network drive. <comment266170> Doesn't work for me. <comment287632> Yes, it requires setting to list view. Can't do with column view. I had to do more steps than this answer describes. But I eventually got it to work.
