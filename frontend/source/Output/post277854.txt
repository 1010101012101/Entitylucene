How to forward an email containing multiple threads with multiple pictures in Mail? <body> I have an email thread I would like to forward. The email thread has a bunch of replies each with pictures.  I can forward and select "include original attachments", but that only includes the images on the most recent reply. Every previous attachment still looks like code&lt;PastedGraphic-14.png&gt;/code.

Okay thanks. <comment349842> I believe for a few versions (iOS 9.x), iOS Mail did include images in replies. You got the option of choosing picture quality on every reply. That behavior has since been reverted, however. I too enjoyed Outlook’s behavior, even if it only includes a down-sampled version of photos from previous emails.
