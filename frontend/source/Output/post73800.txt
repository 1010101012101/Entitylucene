Word 2011 for Mac: How to delete a Quick Style Set? <body> Tryig to delete a quick style set from Word 2011 for Mac. This link claims the styles are in "/Users/USERNAME/Library/Application Support/Microsoft/Office/Style Set" and the save dialog seems to confirm that.  However if I try to go there with the Finder, there is no visible or hidden "Office" folder in the "Microsoft" folder.  Any ideas?  <answer80921> On my Mac OS X 10.5.8 system with Word 2008, I do indeed have a folder "/Users/USERNAME/Library/Application Support/Microsoft/Office/". I can get to it either with Finder or with the Terminal command-line.  You might want to double-check that you are in "/Users/USERNAME/Library/Application Support/", and not the system-wide "/Library/Application Support/".  There is a "Microsoft" directory in both places, but they contain different things.  <answer171409> I'm not a Mac expert, but I think I figured it out. I'm running Office 2011 on Mac OS X 10.9.5. I searched for the name of one of the other quick set styles to figure it out.  The quick set folder is located at: code/Applications/Microsoft Office 2011/Office/Media/QuickStyles//code.  <comment93320> It seems to me your question really is, "Where is the Office folder within Application Support/Microsoft?" It looks to me that once you find the correct folder, you'll have no trouble following the instructions for deleting a Quck Style Set.
