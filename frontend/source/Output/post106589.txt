Write in NTFS using Mavericks <body> I was able to read and write NTFS filesystems normally in Mountain Lion, but after the upgrade this stopped to work.  I installed ntfs-3g and fuse4x using homebrew in Mountain Lion and followed the instructions displayed by homebrew to finish the installation of fuse4x kernel extension.  To try to solve this problem I removed ntfs-3g, fuse4x and fuse4x-kext and reinstalled them. But this didn't solve my problem.  Does anyone know how to solve this? Thanks.  <answer107395> I had the same setup as you, and since upgrading to 10.9 I can't write to NTFS. The solution I ended up going with (at least for the short term,) was to use Paragon's NTFS for Mac® OS X 11. It seems to work fine, and has a 10 day free trial.   Hopefully a better method will be found soon, but I got tired of messing with it.  Another option that I didn't try was to edit the code/etc/fstab/code file. The following is from NTFS Write Support On OS X Mountain Lion:  ul liUninstall other 3rd-party NTFS software, like Paragon, Tuxera or NTFS-3G./li liEdit code/etc/fstab/code (you can do this with codesudo vi /etc/fstab/code) Add the following line: strongLABEL=”VOLUME_NAME_WITHOUT_QUOTES” none ntfs rw,auto,nobrowse/strong/li liNow, just unmount and re-mount the disk/li /ul  <answer107986> I used a combination of macfuse-core-10.5-2.1.9, and ntfs-3g-2010.10.2-macosx on OS X Mavericks and I am able to write to a NTFS drive.  ul liFirstly Install macfuse-core-10.5-2.1.9 /li liThen install ntfs-3g-2010.10.2-macosx /li liAfter installations, let's open the NTFS-3G  ul liSystem Preference  NTFS-3G /li liClick [enable] /li /ul/li liFinally, let's unmount your target NTFS disk and mount it again /li /ul  Even if you go the TimeOut message, you are in the right direction already.

It works well on 10.9 Maverick. If you are using Seagate HDD, you can also download the free [Seagate NTFS driver](http://www.seagate.com/support/external-hard-drives/desktop-hard-drives/backup-plus-desk/ntfs-driver-for-mac-os-master-dl/) <comment126852> after this, volume is not displaying in finder window. to access it goto "/Volumes" from   Menu-Go-"Go To Folder"  menu. Also you can add this volume to sidebar to future easy access.. <comment130578> This didn't work for me. <comment130579> Can you detail the steps to arrange this combination? Simply installing both doesn't work for me. <comment131138> Note that not everyone has homebrew installed by default. Could you please add a link to the homebrew website explaining that you need to install that to get the `brew` command? <comment131308> works like a charm ! <comment132167> Worked nicely for my 10.9 install.  Thanks! <comment132179> ntfs-3g is a FUSE filesystem, so it runs in user space - while it's free and probably works fine (used to use it on Linux a lot), you may find a commercial NTFS driver such as Tuxera's is faster if you do a lot of read/write to NTFS filesystems. <comment133117> Just as a warning to others, I used this and then had backblaze backing up the drive (constant activity for days) and eventually my drive freaked out, crashed OSX, and even after I removed the drive I was not able to get OSX to be stable again until I removed the /etc/fstab file. I don't recommend this option on Mavericks <comment135938> Didn't work for me... I get this: "diskarbitrationd[21]: unable to mount /dev/disk1s1 (status code 0x0000000D)." <comment141949> Had some permissions issues. Make sure you everything is linked ```brew upgrade fuse4x``` ```brew upgrade ntfs-3g``` <comment143503> ntfs-3g seems to require osxfuse which conflicts with fuse4x .. <comment144090> To bad that no icon is displayed on the desktop. I wonder why that is. <comment144137> @grgarside You can add it to your desktop with just one more command. `sudo ln -s /Volumes ~/Desktop/Volumes` via [this article](http://learnaholic.me/2013/11/11/enable-ntfs-write-on-mac-os-x-mavericks/) <comment150812> I have also tried this solution from some blog and it worked!!! However, until I was copying using terminal, all was working fine. As soon as I tried copying using Finder to a folder, containing minimum of 50GB of Data, in external HDD, content of the target folder went empty without any notification or error. :( Now that folder always seems empty. <comment151698> Doesn't work on Mavericks for me either. <comment152055> didn't work for me, got `The OSXFUSE library version this program is using is incompatible with the loaded OSXFUSE kernel extension.` Installing OSXFUSE manually form http://osxfuse.github.io/ fixed this issue <comment162116> Worked great for me on OSX 10.9.3 (Mavericks). Thanks for the recommendation <comment165371> Wonderful. Works fine. Had a warning though of unidentified 'core'. <comment190612> Be advised that the current version of osxfuse contains a nasty bug that leaves broken directories behind in /Volumes. <comment198428> @HaiFengKao Does that only work with Seagate drives? <comment198478> @Szabolcs Yes. The driver will detect your HDD brand. <comment199979> Thanks, I was missing the "Click [enable]". For the TimeOut message, you got FuseWait I think. <comment201022> Worked fine in Mavericks. Had to use ``brew install`` instead of ``brew upgrade``. Also, didn't have to explicitly install ``osxfuse`` first, as it is a ``ntfs-3g`` dependency and brew installs it automatically upon ``brew install ntfs-3g``. <comment214034> If you are looking for a safe, working homebrew-powered way for making NTFS R/W work on _Yosemite_, check my anwser on another question: http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/180248/50394 @mattburns You can copy from that anwser to improve this one, if you like. <comment214176> Thanks @cubuspl42, that worked for me (I had to tweak your answer with a few edits). Cheers. <comment214239> Does `brew cask uninstall osxfuse` uninstall pure homebrew, non-cask version of osxfuse that most Mavericks users have installed? <comment215526> This is the best way to write to NTFS volumes. Using 3rd party applications like Paragon NTFS or osxfuse will mess up your modules which leads to frequent kernel panics. I had the same issue when trying Paragon extFS for ext4. See this thread for related issues: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/29842/how-can-i-mount-an-ext4-file-system-on-os-x (the thread is for ext4, but ntfs is basically the same when you're using a 3rd party application) <comment219722> There is small drawback....you need to repeat this step for *every single* drive you insert...a little bit of a pain, but well...no biggie... <comment223497> It's probably less brittle to replace the last command with this:  `sudo ln -s /usr/local/sbin/mount_ntfs /sbin/mount_ntfs` <comment230538> `$ sudo mv /sbin/mount_ntfs /sbin/mount_ntfs.original Password: mv: rename /sbin/mount_ntfs to /sbin/mount_ntfs.original: Operation not permitted` <comment234735> If you get following error while installing ntfs-3g "Error: No available formula for ntfs-3g", try installing it by running: brew install homebrew/fuse/ntfs-3g <comment256720> It worked. But its not showing drive on desktop or even in devices... just showing in /Volumes  It use to show up in maverick <comment256726> @AkarshSatija Maybe try http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/180248/62697 or https://gist.github.com/mrpatiwi/8bca2f20b140150f1cbd <comment257826> @AkarshSatija I found the issue: osxfuse 3.0.x is required instead of 2.8.x
