How to show desktop files on both screens? <body> I have a dual monitors setup. Files in the desktop and shown on the first screen. Is there a way to have those files also appear (mirrored) on the second screen?  I do not want screen mirroring, I just want to mirror desktop files. Is that possible?  <comment336889> Let me paraphrase your question. Dual monitors setup without mirroring means that you have one, usually long rather than tall, desktop. Depends on how you've arranged them. So what you are actually asking for is how to have your files TWICE on the very SAME desktop :) Thing is that without mirroring it is one desktop simply displayed by two physical devices. One possible way to achieve your goal would be to create symbolic links (shortcuts) to your files and put them on a second screen. <comment337105> @DenisRasulev yep you've phrased the problem perfectly :) I want to use that to pick up a screenshot I've just made more easily (grab it from the second monitor), so symlinks wouldn't help (unless they are automatically created)
