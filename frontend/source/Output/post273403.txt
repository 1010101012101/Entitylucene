How can i delete a third partition to free up space for the other 2 <body> thanks for looking.  I have 3 partitions on a 1TB imac. On one partition i have yosemite, which i want to increase. On another i have el capitain, which has all my work on. I have a third partition which has nothing on and i want to delete this and free up space.  You can see the set up pictorially below  When I use disk utility i can delete the unwanted partition, but all it does is create free space which i can't assign. I've tried to do this with disk utility in yosemite and el captain, which has an updated disk utility but am unable.  I would prefer to work this out with a GUI, but if forced can use terminal commands  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Mb7jg.png" alt="partition image"
