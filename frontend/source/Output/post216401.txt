Can I use Airport if the network needs daily authentication? <body> Each day, in my company, I need to manually login via a web portal:  ol liDo a google request - leads to nowhere/li liDo the same request from HTTPS to HTTP/li liBe redirected to the login portal/li liClick login, an AUTH popup shows itself/li liEnter credentials./li liAccess to the web /li /ol  Can the Airport Extreme be used in that condition?  Will it ask to do the same step for the first user connecting to the Airport Extreme in the morning?   Or will we have to each day, reconfigure the airport manually?  Thanks  <answer216414> The Airport line of devices do not support captive portals, if that's what you're referring to. There is no way to set one up to support this. That's more an enterprise feature, and wouldn't be found in most consumer APs.  <comment261488> Airport is used for a unix command line tool, to brand Apple's networking hardware of various generations and options. What specifically is "airport" and what does "used" look like? What is the end goal you are trying to achieve? <comment261492> "User connecting to the airport." He means an AP. It seems pretty clear to me. He's asking about the Airport Extreme, or Express (probably Extreme though).
