Disable 'hide toolbar' in Finder <body> Is it possible to permanently overwrite the 'Hide Toolbar' and 'Hide Sidebar' setting in the Finder, particularly in DMG images with downloaded Applications, so that the toolbar and sidebar are emalways visible/em?  That way it would be possible to drop applications directly into the Applications folder.  <comment218753> That's one reason I keep Applications on the right side of my dock. <comment218775> Sure, same thing here. <comment218914> I do not believe there is a way to override custom window settings on DMGs.
