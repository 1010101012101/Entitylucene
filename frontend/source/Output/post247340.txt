My MacBook Pro's trackpad becomes unresponsive when waking up from sleep, why does this happen? <body> Whenever I leave my laptop on sleep for at least 10+ minutes, the trackpad becomes unresponsive and takes a while to load (NOTE: This problem mostly happens when I am carrying my laptop to another location in my bookbag). I have to keep tapping the trackpad 5-7 times (rapidly) in order for it to finally respond. When the laptop is on a flat surface, going to sleep and waking up is no issue whatsoever.  I have tried running a hardware diagnosis test from Apple and everything looks fine (so no trackpad issue). In addition, I have cleaned out my trackpad from free of dust but that doesn't seem to fix my issue.  Does anyone know what this issue is, how can I resolve this myself?  Additional details:   ol liLaptop operating on Mac OS X version 10.9.5, early 2011/li liThe same issue of trackpad is also happening with my Logitech M510 USB mouse. I have to click 5-7 times in order for the clicks to respond. I've switched USB ports but that doesn't help. /li liLaptop is using SSD, I though it was sudden motion sensor interfering but that wasn't it./li li70% of the time I use Logitech M510, 30% is the track pad. Surprisingly, the build-in keyboard is having no issues./li liTrackpad and USB mouse operate fine on El Capitan (10.11, booted from external hard drive) but the issue is on Mavericks (10.9). It may be software related than hardware (maybe)!/li /ol  <comment305257> Have you tried [resetting the SMC](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201295)?
