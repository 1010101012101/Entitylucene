Harddrive not recognised on laptop after using in mac book pro <body> Please can someone help? I was using an apple mac book pro for work and saved all my documents on a hard drive as i had to return the mac book. I'm now trying to open the hard drive on my laptop at home and unfortunately my laptop isnt recognising my hard drive. What can i do as all my work for the last 6 years is on the hard drive and i have no access to a mac anymore?  <answer98110> Well.... assuming you have a Windows laptop (otherwise there would be no problem), and further assuming you do not have money to spend here is a free solution.  How to read Mac OS HFS drives in Windows for free1  Access and copy files from a Mac-formatted hard disk on a Windows PC  <comment115110> I'm assuming that the hard-drive you're hooking up is an external hard-drive. Does this device mount on other computers, either OS X & Windows? If this is a USB drive, does the USB port you're using work with other USB devices, like a thumb drive? <comment115112> As above, a little clarification will help - I assume you are using an external USB drive that was in use on a Mac, and now you have it on a Windows PC, and it won't open it.  It sounds like it's formated in the Mac HFS filesystem which windows cannot read.  You will probably need to get it attached to a Mac somehow (Apple store?) And copy stuff off onto a device formatted for use in either Mac or Windows - like a USB stick rather than drive. <comment115117> stuffe, the original user should clarify just to be explicit, but given the "no access to a mac" statement, your comment is almost certain to be the answer. I would post it as such. <comment115134> Relax, sounds like your data is safe and sound.   Follow @stuffe advice and get it moved across to a drive that can be read by both windows or mac.   Good one would be MS_DOS FAT formatted drive.   Some software can probably do it, but easiest is to find a mac and do the copy.
