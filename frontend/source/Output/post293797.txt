Memory Movies in Photos app for Mac <body> The iPhone has a great "Memory Movie" feature that that assembles pictures and videos of one person into a little music video.  Can you do that on the Photos app too? I could only find the slideshow, which isn't the same thing. For instance it doesn't play the "live photo" videos, it just shows stills.  <answer293798> Looks like it's not possible according to the Apple pagE: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207023
