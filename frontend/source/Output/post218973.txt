Generate Safari Developer Certificate for building extensions <body> I have gone through this link.But everything seems to be changed. Everything redirects to Apple Development Program.So is it mandatory to enroll in that development program to create a safari development certificate to create extensions?  And if so where can I get that certificate from?  <answer218975> Apple unified all the developer programs (iOS, Mac and Safari) under one umbrella program entitled Apple Developer Program. This is what you need to enrol with to obtain a certificate for Safari extensions.
