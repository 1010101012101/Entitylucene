Create new 'super-category' in iTunes heirachy <body> In iTunes, I have many audio files which aren't music. In my case they are guitar tutorial tracks, but others may have similar things which are for language learning or self-help/hypnosis tracks.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JYH7I.png" alt="enter image description here"  I don't want these lumped in with the rest of my music, as I find they clutter up my music collection, make it hard to find things and makes playing my music on 'shuffle' a strange experience.  I know I can untick the songs to prevent them from being played, or create some kind of playlist for the songs I do want to play, but these are not ideal solutions.  Is there a way of removing them from the 'Music' super-folder altogether, ideally creating a new super-folder just for them? (By super-folder I mean the 'Music', 'Movies' and 'TV Shows' categories that appear on the left).  <answer120629> Select all the items and get the item information by pressing codeCommand+I/code. Choose codeOptions/code tab and change the strongMedia Kind/strong to the suitable category. It doesnâ€™t let you create a new category, but the some of existing categories should fit to your media (perhaps using iTunes U or Audiobook).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QO6RH.jpg" alt="Media Kind in iTunes 10"
