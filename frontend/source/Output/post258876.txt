Outlook Spell Checker on MAC <body> I am looking for a way to stop sending an email if there are any spelling errors on outlook 2016 Mac. I know you can do this on windows outlook. Can someone please shed some advise on this.   Many Thanks  <answer258892> This can be found with a simple web search: see https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Check-spelling-before-sending-a-message-620b24fc-9cc5-4a2f-a26b-9ff4e02cc193 for the documentation on the feature.  Which basically says:  Click File  Options  Mail. Under Compose messages, check the Always check spelling before sending box.
