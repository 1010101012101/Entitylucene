Macbook non retina displays App Store icons pixelated <body> I am running macOS Sierra 10.12 on a macbook pro late 2011 with a non retina display. I am experiencing pixelated icons when I brows the App Store. Does anybody have the same issue? Is there any way to solve this without buying a new macbook?   I attached an image below. As you can see the "macOS Sierra" icon is pixelated around the edges, also a few others.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gaz33.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment320861> Were you having this issue on a previous version of OS X (Mavericks, Yosemite, El Capitan)? <comment320863> I did not use this macbook for quite a while, it was sitting around for years. Since I decided to use it I erased everything and installed the shiny new OS  from Apple (Sierra). So I have no clue if this issue was present on a previous OSX. <comment320869> Possibly related question: http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/257013/88313 <comment320873> yes it seems to be the same problem, but unfortunately the answer provided there does not help <comment320876> Before spending any money to buy a new one, I would at least install El Capitan on it.  If the problem isn't there, then you know the issue is Sierra. <comment320885> It isn't pixelation, it's transparency artifacts, and it's the exact same issue as listed in the other question.
