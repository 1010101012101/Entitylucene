"PROGRAMMING KEYS" Microsoft Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 / Mac Mini OS X 10.9.5 <body> I used to have my up and down arrow keys in the Microsoft keyboard programmed to "send backward" or "bring forward" when using InDesign on my Mac. Somehow I set it back to default settings (so they now move things up and down). How can I reprogram them? I checked the Apple menusystem preferenceskeyboard and didn't see those keys listed. I also tried apple menusystem preferencesmicrosoft keyboard. I assume it can be done here but I can't figure out how. Can someone please explain to me in detail? BTW I'm not great with computers or computer lingo so be very detailed and speak in layman's terms. Thanks!  <answer225810> Adobe apps have their own Keyboard Shortcuts setup, in the Edit menu.  I don't have InDesign, only Photoshop, but this is what it looks like in there…  It's in Layer  Arrange [you need to do a lot of scrolling to get there]  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LNHD1.png" alt="enter image description here"  After comments…  It may not be possible to assign a single-key shortcut in Adobe, it may always need to include kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd  however, you could perhaps do the equivalent inbr System Prefs  Keyboard  Keyboard  App Shortcutsbr by assigning each one to 'All Applications' - which will then work in any app that actually has that precisely-worded command…  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AbjC3.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment274151> Yes. I tried that in photoshop. It wouldn't allow me to select the arrow key(s). In InDesign I can't even figure out how to find the option "send backword" or "send forward".... Also, I am positive that isn't how I did this before because once those keys were assigned, they performed that function in every program I have. <comment274154> ah, OK, that makes me think you did it a different way - see my edit. <comment274193> Ok I tried that, <comment274194> Looked good but didn't change anything... I'd add a screen shot but this won't allow me to.; No way to attach
