How to kill stuck Screen sharing authentication dialogue? <body> Sometimes when connecting to a screen sharing machine in Finder, the authentication dialogue hangs indefinitely. The only way I've been able to get rid of it is log out.  So far I've tried killing a number of processes including:  ul liScreen Sharing/li liFinder/li liDock/li liSystemUIServer/li /ul  To no avail. Any idea what process this UI is attached to?  <answer45775> Yes, it's called codeNetAuthAgent/code.  subYou can tell I've had this problem before! :(/sub  <comment52179> +1 Yep, Me too! Mine seemed to be related with not being able to contact a remote machine via its name, e.g. mac-mini.local, only using its IP address. <comment60246> Those stuck Screen Sharing auth windows have been driving me crazy forever. Thank you so much! Now if I could only get Screen sharing to actually connect reliably...
