Can I replace OS X with Windows on my MacBook? <body> I spend most of my time on this MacBook doing my own tech support and according to the internet I'm not the only one with an inexplicably defective new iToy. How can I replace OS X with Windows? I use Parallels when I give up but I'd rather use Windows full-time.  <comment278315> Search for BootCamp. You seriously don't want to completely remove OS X I suppose? If so, you should definately sell your Macbook ;) <comment278316> Why should Windows work better with an "inexplicably defective new iToy". I'd rather try to solve the "defect". <comment278351> It's worth mentioning: Macs are not iToys. iOS devices are what's generally referred to as iToys. Macs are for professionals, and people who value OS stability.
