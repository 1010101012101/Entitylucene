How to undo pressing Don't Trust on Apple Watch <body> I want to test out my watch app on Xcode. So I plugged my iPhone paired with an Apple Watch Series 2 into my computer. The iPhone displayed a dialog saying whether to trust this computer or not, I clicked on trust and the iPhone is properly displayed in Xcode. In a minute the same popup appeared on my Watch, however I accidentally clicked Don't Trust on the Apple Watch, now the watch doesn't show up in Xcode. Usually to fix this for iPhone I would just plug the phone into the computer again, but I tried that, and the popup did not reappear on my Watch.  Is there a way to trust my computer again without erasing all datas on the Watch?
