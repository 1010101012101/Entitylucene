“App Sandbox’ – Nisus Writer Pro asking for permission to access "Document Manager" folder <body> When running Nisus Writer Pro 2.1.7 the first time on macOS El Capitan, a dialog appears asking:     Nisus Writer Pro needs access to the "Document Manager" folder. Would you like to grant permission by choosing the folder?      Due to increased security on the Mac, sandboxed applications are prevented from accessing files until the user interacts with them. The last known location was:      ~/Documents/Nisus Documents      [ Quit ]    [ Disable ]    [ Choose Folder… ]   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wFhkW.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  I assume this relates to Apple’s new emApp Sandbox/em feature in macOS. I do not yet understand the ramifications or behavior of the App Sandbox. Today with Nisus Writer is my first encounter.  ➠ I want the old classic behavior, letting this app access any file in any folder. Does that "Disable" button provide the old behavior, killing the new App Sandbox behavior?  If not, what are my options? What does "choosing a folder" get me?  Can I change my choice later? If so, how?
