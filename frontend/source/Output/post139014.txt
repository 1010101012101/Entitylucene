iPhone without a SIM card as an iPod touch? <body> Can I use an iPhone without a SIM card as an iPod touch?br/  I do not know the previous carrier, because the Iphone was reset and has no sim card.  Is there any way I can use it as an iPod touch (without activating it) ?  <answer139015> First of all Im assuming that you are in the welcome menu and you cant pass this screen:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/epPBJ.png" alt="enter image description here"  So I know there is a way to activate it with RedSn0w but I dont know if it works with iOS 7 so I would recommend you to check that option.  Or you can UNLOCK it via IMEI and then activate it with any SIM.  <comment163980> All you should have to do is turn it on.  Are you having a specific problem?
