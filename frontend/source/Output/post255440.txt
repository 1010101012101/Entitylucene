Not showing the default folder when opening Finder <body> Finder does not open the default folder when I open it for the first time. It shows the "preferences" folder in my library (codeuser/library/preferences/code). I do not know why.  The default folder is properly set up in the Finder Preferences (to show "desktop"), but it only works for new windows, not when opening Finder for the first time.  Any idea?  <comment318138> Just tested and this worked for me. Try trashing the preferences file. ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist
