How do I pair apple wireless keyboard with windows 10 <body> My apple wireless keyboard has stopped pairing with Windows 10. Now when I try to pair through settings, I'm asked to enter a passcode for the keyboard rather than being supplied a passcode to pair the device. I'm unable to type anything using the keyboard. Entering four zeros using the laptop keyboard does not work. I've tried un-installing bluetooth drivers and reinstalling. This doesn't help. Any advice?  <answer269278> Just had this problem as well. I fixed it by going to bluetooth settings in control panel instead of action center.  ol liPress the windows key on your old keyboard and type in "Control Panel"/li liIn the searchbar type in bluetooth/li liSelect "add a bluetooth device"/li liMake sure your keyboard is turned on and in pairing mode (flashing green light)/li liThen select it and type in the passcode listed on the screen using your new keyboard, and press enter.  Note: the screen doesn't give information about what key was already typed, so this may take a few tries if your press the wrong key./li /ol  <comment277389> Have you tried reinstalling the Boot Camp drivers? <comment277565> Windows 10 is installed on my PC not a Mac
