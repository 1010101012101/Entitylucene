Glitch in 'Open with...' <body> I want to change all media apps to open with VLC.  So I right click on one, get info, open with:  But now this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GH3hS.png" alt="enter image description here"  And I only have one VLC on my system:  ps-MacBook-Air:~ pi$ sudo find / -iname "VLC.app" /Applications/VLC.app  Is this a microscopic bug?  And who is at fault? I suspect maybe VLC needs to register somewhere as a media player and maybe it has registered twice?  <answer118202> This is a well known bug in codeLaunchServices/code.  You need to rebuild the database using this command:   precode/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -kill -r -domain local -domain user;killall Finder;echo "Open With has been rebuilt, Finder will relaunch" /code/pre  then  precodekillall Finder /code/pre  Once you have done that you will only have one entry for each application.  Here is the command split onto multiple lines   precode/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/\ LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/\ lsregister -kill -r -domain local -domain user /code/pre  (Notice the code\/code characters that allow a command to stretch across physical lines in codebash/code.)
