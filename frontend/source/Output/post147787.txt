Notification Center message via AppleScript/osascript -- specify an application name and icon <body> When sending a notification to OS X's Notification Center via AppleScript's codeosascript/code, such as in:  precodeosascript -e 'display notification "Finished that long running task." with title "Finally!"' /code/pre  The Notification Center shows "AppleScript Editor" as the notification's source:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IYeDq.png" alt="NotificationCenter"  Is there a possibility to specify a different source (as in application) and icon when sending a notification this way?  <answer147854>   I don't think it's possible with AppleScript but it is with terminal-notifier:  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"code-sender ID         The bundle identifier of the application that should be shown as the sender, including its icon. -appIcon URL       The URL of a image to display instead of the application icon (Mavericks+ only) /code/pre  For example:  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codeterminal-notifier -title title -message message -sender com.apple.TextEdit /code/pre  <answer293506> You should be able to do  precodeosascript -e 'tell app "System Events" to display notification "Finished that long running task." with title "Finally!"' /code/pre  You can change code"System Events"/code to any other application name.  <comment174347> Thank you, `terminal-notifier` is perfect. Btw, it's available via homebrew. <comment348753> Pro tip: You can use emoji in AppleScript notifications. <comment370415> No matter what I specify as application name, it always shows with the Script Editor icon and application name. <comment370438> Oh. Ok... To be honest, I only tried it from a terminal window. My bad! (unless there's a bug... after all, why would it work differently from the script editor... hmmm)
