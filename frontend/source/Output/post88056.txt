Why is AirDrop so slow? <body> I am trying different solutions to transfer some 1 GB size files between two Macs on my local wireless network (typically between me and a guest, both being physically in the living room). Here are the solutions I have come up with:  ol liThrough SSH (codescp/code command): I get a transfer speed between 3 and 4 MB/s./li liThrough Skype, the rate fluctuates a lot, but can reach up to 2 MB/s./li liThrough AirDrop, I only get about 150 kB/s!/li /ol  Obviously, AirDrop on recent computers is easier: it doesn't require the other person to have an SSH port open, or to have a Skype account. But it's so very slow…  Why is AirDrop so slow? Is it a typical transfer rate? Is there something I can do to improve it?  <answer88099> It could be interfering with existing wifi network, you can use the Airport command line tool to disconnect from other networks:  Begin by linking it to a another location:  precodeln -s \   /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport \   /usr/local/bin/airport /code/pre  Then, disconnect from the current network:  precodesudo airport -z /code/pre  You should be running at about strong10/strong Mbps !  <comment103088> wifi or BT connection ? <comment103096> @Buscar웃 wifi... <comment103148> Also note that there are other ways to accomplish this. iMessage comes to mind. I use DropBox LAN Sync, haven't test speed but oh so just works. And other third-party, DropCopy, more ... <comment167734> does it mean that airport is designed to be used without existing wifi (thru access point or router) connectivity? <comment349011> Yes. Airdrop will establish a direct wifi connection between two devices, regardless of which networks each happens to be on.
