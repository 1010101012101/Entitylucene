How to hide or clear unread badges on Gmail folders in Mail.app? <body> This isn't a new problem with OS X Mail, it persists into Mountain Lion.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bUUqh.png" alt="Mountain Lion Mail unread badges"  The badges are quite obnoxious; I can go into that [Gmail] folder and right-click and Mark As Read. But they start piling up right away again.  Is there a way to never have a badge beside any non-Inbox folder, or have a way for Mail to automatically clean up?  <answer59464> I don't know how to make the badge go away but a way to reduce the number of the unread messages if they're spam is to modify the settings on your gmail account on the web.
