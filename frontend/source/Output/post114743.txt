Can I bind two arrow keys to a single shortcut? <body> I'd like to be able to bind a shortcut key to perform differently when pressing two arrow keys than when pressing one or the other. For instance, I want to make a new shortcut key for kbdCommand/kbd+kbdLeft/kbd+kbdUp/kbd that will be different from kbdCommand/kbd+kbdLeft/kbd and kbdCommand/kbd+kbdUp/kbd.   Is this possible?  I'm using OS X 10.9 - Mavericks.  <answer114751> On your keyboard you have 2 kind of keys :   ul liNormal keys, which you can't combine/li liModifier keys, which you can combine. /li /ul  kbdUp/kbd, kbdleft/kbd, kbddown/kbd or kbdright/kbd aren't modifiers whereas kbdCmd/kbd, kbdOption/kbd or kbdShift/kbd are.  So no you won't be able to do it.   <answer114767> You could use a private.xml like this with KeyRemap4MacBook:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;   &lt;item&gt;     &lt;name&gt;test&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;identifier&gt;test&lt;/identifier&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__SimultaneousKeyPresses__     KeyCode::CURSOR_UP,     MODIFIERFLAG_EITHER_LEFT_OR_RIGHT_COMMAND | ModifierFlag::NONE,     KeyCode::CURSOR_LEFT,     MODIFIERFLAG_EITHER_LEFT_OR_RIGHT_COMMAND | ModifierFlag::NONE,     KeyCode::F19&lt;/autogen&gt;   &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  Then use F19 as the shortcut.  <comment134420> This does describe the stock behavior, but there are many ways to augment that with assistive devices, scripting, changing the key mapping, etc...
