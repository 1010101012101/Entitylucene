How to recover files from command "git clean -df" <body> I accidentally run the command "git clean -df", so I lost many directories and files, I want to recover them, I don't have backup in time machine. I tried some software to recover, but they don't work.  <answer215134> If you are working with an online repository and you keep it up-to-date you can download all the file from the online repository using the following commands:  precodegit pull                            # in the case the remote is set git clone &lt;address_of_repository&gt;   # in the case the remote is not set /code/pre  Using these commands you'll be able to restore your deleted files, obviously only if the online repository is up to date.     <comment259813> You can't recover files after deleting them. The only way would be to immediately shut down your Mac, WITHOUT modifying ANY part of the HD, then use a HD Recovery Program. You probably already lost your data, as it gets overwritten by new files. Let this be a lesson to use Time Machine or some other backup software, especially when using terminal commands that delete stuff. <comment259822> Are you sure that files have been deleted in the online repository? If you are working in the local repository and you have one up-to-dated online, you can download the last online version using `git clone` or  `git pull`. <comment259880> Nope, I mean it delete all my folders and files in my local machine, not related to git <comment259882> @IronCraftMan thank you for your reply, do you know is there some good software for recovering files for mac OS X? I am almost try every method, but failed T.T <comment259883> In this particular case the only solution is follow what IronCraftMan suggested to you. <comment259922> haha, thank you, but i prefer IronMan. haha <comment259957> @llyjy21 as I said, you probably already overwrote the data. By installing that other Software, and whatever else you did, OS X could have modified the HD. It's too late. Since every method has failed, I'd give up. Next time backup your data. <comment333176> Same question on SO: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6267180/can-i-undo-a-git-clean-fdx
