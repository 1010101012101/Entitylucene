Mac shifts desktops on maximizing <body> Before maximizing an app (like google chrome for example) img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6hRnj.png" alt="enter image description here"  After maximizing google chrome:img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fw8Sw.png" alt="enter image description here"  Why did it shift desktops? Its somewhat irritating when I use multiple desktops and an empty one is created in between. How can I turn this feature off?  <answer259434> You're simply confused as how to operate the system properly. When you think you're "maximizing" the window, you're really full-screening the application.  In order to "maximize" the window, you'll need to hold down the Alt-key while clicking the green "+" button in the top left corner of the Chrome window.  You can also maximize windows through other means - such as through an application such as SizeUp! or similar.  <comment324575> Possible duplicate of [Yosemite auto creates multiple desktops (spaces) on main monitor](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/157540/yosemite-auto-creates-multiple-desktops-spaces-on-main-monitor) <comment324576> I don't get the problem. When you full-screen an app, it gets its own space. <comment324684> Not a duplicate. macOS is functioning as intended, as the answer below explains, unlike the linked question.
