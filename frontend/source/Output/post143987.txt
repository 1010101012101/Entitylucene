Can an app be restricted to access Internet <body> I have an iOS app, I don't want this (only this) app to access Internet. Is there any option in the settings to do that?  <answer144002> Unfortunately, I don't believe there is a per-app setting.  <answer144009> You can not prevent it from accessing the internet completely. However, you can disable it from using mobile data. Go to Settings - Network and scroll down.
