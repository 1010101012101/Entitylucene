I had a problem separating the two drives from the DIY Fusion that left the SSD bricked. I fixed it by "re-fusing" the two drives and then separating them again with no problems, SSD started working as a single drive again as if nothing ever happened.  Problem is that today it stopped working.   I was running a MacBook Pro with the system installed in this SSD and it wouldn't start up anymore (Folder with a question mark showing when booting).   I removed the SSD from the MBP and I'm reading it externally using a dock station now.
