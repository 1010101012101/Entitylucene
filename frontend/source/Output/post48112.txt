How to change tap to click using "defaults write" from command line? <body> I want to change the trackpad tap-to-click property from the command line. Graphically, I can do it by clicking System Preferences - Trackpad - Tap to Click. How can I do it from  the command line?  I have tried:  precodedefaults write com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.trackpad Clicking -int 0 defaults write GlobalPreferences com.apple.mouse.tapBehavior -int 0 /code/pre  but these didn't work (with int as 1 and 0, with reboot). Am I missing some step? I have Macbook 5,1 Snow Leopard.  <answer48126> Got it to work. The correct format (for me) is:   precodedefaults -currentHost write -globalDomain com.apple.mouse.tapBehavior -int 0 /code/pre  Change 0 to 1 if you want to enable the tap-to-click. This seems to be really sensitive to which version you are using. The commands in the question have worked for others.  Logout - login is required for this to work.  <answer48194> I had the following in my code.osx/code file:  precode# Enable tap to click (Trackpad) for this user and for the login screen defaults write com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.trackpad Clicking -bool true defaults -currentHost write NSGlobalDomain com.apple.mouse.tapBehavior -int 1 defaults write NSGlobalDomain com.apple.mouse.tapBehavior -int 1 /code/pre  <comment55091> How do you know that those are the correct keys for the tap-to-click behavior? Have you diffed the relevant files before and after changing the preference in the system GUI? <comment55094> Both lines are instructions from google searches and the upperone is changed when I use gui. I also tried with -bool true/false as Clicking-key is actually boolean. Is there other places what I should tinker with? Like "allow-command-line-access = true"? <comment55109> There's no allow-command-line-access setup; `defaults` should work. Have you checked boolean YES/NO or string true/false/yes/no? <comment69211> If you need to logout and login, what do you gain by avoiding Sys Pref GUI? <comment69724> Do it for 100 computers/accounts after every upgrade (once per year). Command line automates banal tasks. <comment178153> In addition to automation, it's a nice log of one's preferences.
