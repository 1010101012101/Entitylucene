network computers renamed after Yosemite install <body> Yosemite install (from Mavericks) has automatically changed the names of my network computers as shown in the Finder sidebar. For example, emmy name IMac/em now displays as emmy name iMac(2)./em My two additional Mac Airs are displaying the same problem.  I have tried changing the computer names in System Preferences (sharing/computer name/edit) to no effect with or without rebooting.  How can I return to the original computer names?  <answer152494> Goto System Preferences/Sharing. That's where you can change your computer name.  <answer152653> strongUPDATE 3:/strong Updating to 10.10.4 fixes this problem. In this point release codediscoveryd/code is replaced by the previously ousted codemDNSResponder/code.  emThe originally supplied workaround follows.../em  There is a bug between Yosemite (the daemon codediscoveryd/code) and sleep servers. These servers reside in Apple TVs and Airports and act as a proxy for a sleeping machine. For now the only fix seems to be:  ul liOn your computer, go to strongSystem Preferences -- Energy Saver/strong, and untick em"Wake for network access"/em (or maybe it is em"Wake for Wi-Fi access"/em, I think it depends on your interface type)./li liShut down your Apple TV/s and/or Airport/s./li liOn your computer, go to strongSystem Preferences -- Sharing/strong, and rename it as you wish./li liReboot your computer and check that the name change has stuck (a reboot is probably not necessary but I did so for good measure)./li liPower-up your Apple TV/s and/or Airport/s./li /ul  I no longer have the incrementing computer name problem, unless I re-enable em"Wake for network access"/em.  strongUPDATE 1:/strong Updating to OS X 10.10.1 (and Apple TV to 7.0.2) didn't help.  strongUPDATE 2:/strong Whilst improved, it's still broken in OS X 10.10.3. But the buggy daemon codediscoveryd/code has apparently been replaced in the 10.10.4 beta by the previously ousted codemDNSResponder/code. So here's hoping it's fixed in the next release.

Which was it? <comment179293> A clean install *shouldn't* do that either, but I'm having the same problem on both a clean install and an update (as soon as I updated to GM3, which is funnyâ€¦) <comment179599> This was not a clean install. I installed over Mavericks. <comment179600> As I said in my original question, that's the first thing I did and it didn't work. <comment180171> Thanks. This worked. And it was immediate; no need to wait a day. I've reported it as a bug to Apple. <comment180366> The fix was temporary. I can still edit the computer name in prefs/sharing, but replication of the computers continues. I now have iMac, iMac(2) and iMac(3) representing a single computer. <comment180508> Sorry about that. Perhaps it was just a coincidence that it worked for me. <comment180576> This "solution" doesn't work. <comment180711> After making the above comment yesterday, I re-enabled "Wake for network access", and this morning I woke to find my computer name changed to "MacBook (2)". So there maybe something there---or it could still be a coincidence. <comment180718> This person here claims to have a fix:  [http://ispire.me/fix-yosemite-rtc-alarm-wakeup-issue/](http://ispire.me/fix-yosemite-rtc-alarm-wakeup-issue/)  Namely:  `sudo /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c "Add :ProgramArguments: string --no-namechange" /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.discoveryd.plist`  Although I'm not willing to try it. This seems to be a treatment for the symptom, not the disease. <comment180845> Yes, "wake for network access" seems to be the culprit. I now have it turned off and no replication since. Thanks for the nteresting fix in the link you posted, but I'm reluctant to be an early adopter.
