.app appended to all apps in Applications folder <body> When I open my applications folder, all the apps inside have their name below the icons appended with the text strong.app/strong. I don't think it used to be this way, is there a way to remove the strong.app/strong text? I'm on strongOS X snow leopard/strong.  <answer33766> Go to strongcodeFinder-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Advanced-&gt;Show all filename extensions/code/strong img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2l6b1.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment38528> Prepended? Do you mean appended? <comment38538> Yes - my bad!!! <comment38575> I believe that 10.4 and lower versions of the operating system still suppressed the ".app" extension even when "Show all filename extensions" was turned on. As of 10.5 and greater, checking that preference also displays the ".app" extension as well as things like ".txt" and ".jpg". <comment38610> That's quite obvious but i think he solely wants to disable ".app" while maintaining all other file extensions
