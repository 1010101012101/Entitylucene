Reset dock icons while log off <body> I have an iMac for public use, I want to ensure the dock icon won't be changed by others (i.e. keep factory setting).  Currently I know the following two commands can do this:  precodedefaults delete com.apple.dock killall Dock /code/pre  However, when I insert this two lines of code into an Logoff script, it won't work.  precode#!/bin/bash  #Reset the dock defaults delete com.apple.dock killall Dock  exit 0 /code/pre  The script is OK and other commands in that script are functioning too.  Any idea to solve this problem?  <answer190101> Since you're logging out you can just delete the emcom.apple.dock.plist/em file in the script using the coderm/code command and no need to use the codekillall/code and codedefaults/code commands.  I just tested this with a logout script and it reset the Dock to the default Dock when logging back in.  I used: coderm "/Users/$USER/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dock.plist"/code
