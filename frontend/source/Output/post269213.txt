MacBook Pro camera app to make series of photos within short time intervals? <body> I am looking for some application that would allow me to make a series of photos (MacBook Pro camera shots) within some small time range, i.e. 1 sec.  (I haven't seen applicable setting in Camera Booth application nor was successful in googling.)
