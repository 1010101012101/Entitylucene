Syncing music from a Mac to a Windows <body> I recently changed from a Mac back to a PC.  I transferred all my music via bluetooth to my new computer.  The new machine will play all my music, but it will not sync with my iPhone.  Any advice?  <answer55560> Try sync with iTunes for Windows.   <comment63836> Can you provide some more details around the "will not sync" part? What software are you using to sync, is there any error message etc?
