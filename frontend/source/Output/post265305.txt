How can I add/list trusted certificates on Lion <body> I think I've run into a problem where there's trusted certificates missing. How can I list trusted certificates (in order to confirm my theory)? How can I add new trusted certificates?  <comment333982> My actual problem was solved by upgrading to Sierra (i think), but still I think that the question deserves an answer (other than upgrading to newer OS).
