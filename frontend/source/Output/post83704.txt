How to create Automator Service to change font of selected text? <body> I'm trying to create a "Service" in Automator that changes the font of the selected text in the frontmost app.  <answer83798> You could assign a shortcut to a script like this:  precodetell application "System Events" to tell (process 1 where frontmost is true)     set {c1, c2} to value of attribute "AXSelectedTextRange" of text area 1 of scroll area 1 of window 1 end tell tell application (path to frontmost application as text) to tell document 1     tell characters c1 thru c2         set font to "Menlo"         set size to 18     end tell end tell /code/pre  It works with TextEdit and WriteRoom, but it probably needs to be modified for other applications.  Another really awful option:  precodetry     set old to the clipboard as record end try do shell script "textutil -stdin -stdout -format html -convert rtf &lt;&lt;&lt; '&lt;span style=\"font: 18px Menlo\"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;' | pbcopy" tell application "System Events"     keystroke "v" using command down     keystroke "c" using {option down, command down}     keystroke "z" using command down     keystroke "v" using {option down, command down} end tell delay 0.05 try     set the clipboard to old end try /code/pre  <answer281303> After much research, the workflow below works for me in TextEdit, Mail, Notes, Stickies. Where it doesn't work is when the app uses Styles (Microsoft Word, Pages, Keynote), because the style overrides the font you input. The only way I can think to override the style is to directly script each app to make a custom style.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9pxx5.png" alt="Force Selected Font Workflow"  ApplesScript Code:  precodeon run {input, parameters}      do shell script "pbpaste | textutil -stdin -stdout -convert rtf -font Arial -fontsize 12 | pbcopy"     tell application "System Events" to keystroke "v" using command down      return input end run /code/pre  <comment96364> The guide on [Ask] will help you refine your question by showing what you've tried and/or what exactly "you don't get". If you don't get a good answer, feel free to try editing in some details or links on what question you used and what step is failing or doesn't make sense. We love details here. <comment96416> I tried this too and have not been able to do so. I would ask Ben Waldie from http://www.automatedworkflows.com He might know.

Not everyone has an app installed that can OCR a graphic image, like I just did. <comment354467> Sorry, I wanted to show the entire workflow with the selected options in automator. Next time I will do both.
