How can I identify files and programs connected to the kernel_task process in Mac OS? <body> I understand that the kernel_task process is linked to several .kext files found in System/Library/Extensions (and possibly Library/Extensions ?)  How can I identify which files are contributing to the 400+ MB memory usage identified in Activity Monitor?  Is there anything I can do to uninstall or delete unneeded processes to reduce memory usage here?  <answer174093> I looked for some generic commands that display/manipulate kernel extensions. codekextstat/code got my attention and based on its output, the 4th column is      The number of bytes of kernel memory that the kext occupies.  If this is zero, the kext is a built-in part of the kernel that has a record as a kext for resolving dependencies among kexts.   The only problem was that its size was in hexadecimal. So I converted the hexadecimal to decimal and printed only relevant information (like kext bundle id).  precodekextstat -l -k | awk '{n = sprintf("%d", $4); print n, $6}' | sort -n /code/pre  Breaking it down:  ul licodekextstat -l -k/code - print a list of loaded non-built-in kexts/li licode| awk '{n = sprintf("%d", $4); print n, $6}'/code - pipe the output to codeawk/code, convert the 4th "size" column from hexadecimal to decimal, print that and the kext bundle id./li licode| sort -n/code - pipe the output to codesort/code command and sort the list using numerical comparison (so that "10" is not less than "1 ")./li /ul  You can pipe the output to codetail -n 3/code to get top 3 memory hoggers. Here are mine:  precode1757184 com.apple.nvidia.driver.NVDAGK100Hal 2572288 com.apple.nvidia.driver.NVDAResman 3923968 com.apple.driver.AirPort.Brcm4360 /code/pre  strongUpdate:/strong you can also pipe this to codegrep -v com.apple/code to see which non-apple kexts are loaded.  <comment204419> The kernel_task is one process - what do you mean by "processes are contributing" <comment204420> Are you talking about the kernel_task process using 400MB physical memory? It's using 2.6GB here, so 400MB doesn't sound too bad. <comment204939> I guess I really mean what .kext files are related to it.  I understand that they are configuration files for various programs on Mac OS but some may be unnecessary.  How can I know which?  Can I uninstall those that are no longer needed? <comment234597> Looks pretty much okay then I guess...AirPort refers to wifi in general, right?  It should be in use even if I don't have an AirPort router, right? <comment234668> Yes, this one refers to WiFi in general.
