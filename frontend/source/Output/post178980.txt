I haven't checked but there are probably apps available that allow you to play OGG files, a simple App Store search of "ogg audio player" should yield some results.  <answer179004> Safari does not natively support OGG audio files, you need install an OGG plugin. Or just install another web browser on your phone which supports OGG files.  <answer179040> Actually, Wikipedia provided solutions for this, Wikipedia:Media help (audio and video)     It is highly recommended that you use a program which is capable of playing both Vorbis audio and Theora video since these two different media formats are often in the same digital container format, Ogg.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WWJnY.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment212155> Thank you, but how to install an OGG on Safari? <comment213846> Ogg Drop will encode audio tracks and CD's into vorbis. It also contains a QuickTime component that allows iTunes to play ogg vorbis files. Ogg Drop is entirely free. <comment213847> Thanks, it seems Ogg Drop works only on the desktop version, (OS).
