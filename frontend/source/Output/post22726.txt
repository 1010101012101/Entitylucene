Mac OS X Lion Mail not sending <body> Since upgrading to Mac OS X Lion, I consistently have issues sending mail from Mail.app. I can receive mail but when I send mail it stays in the outbox. Sometimes I can send the mail in the outbox by deleting it, rebooting my MacBook Pro, and then recreate the message and send it out.  Does anyone have a solution?  <answer22733> Use Activity when you send to see what happening. If nothing obvious shows up you could archive your mailboxes, and removed the account and re-added it,.  You could also rename the code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.mail.plist/code to codecom.apple.mail.plist_backup/code and re-open Mail.  <answer22737> These problems usually come down to one of two things:  ol liYou have incorrectly configured the log-in settings for your outgoing mail server run by the company that provides your email service. Port numbers, authentication method, user name, password, and other settings./li liThe problem is on the end of the company that provides your email service. Their servers are misbehaving./li /ol  In either case, call the tech support line of the company that provides your email service and have them troubleshoot it with you.  <comment25327> Does **Window â†’ Connection Doctor** say anything?
