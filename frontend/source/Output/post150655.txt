Devices folder in Finder? <body> Is there anyway that I can view the code/dev/code folder with its contained pseudo-files inside of Finder? I can access it just fine in the terminal with codecd /dev/code, but in Finder it doesn't show up even with codeAppleShowAllFiles/code active.  <answer150661> No, just had a fiddle and it appears there is no way to do that.  strongNeither of these work:/strong  In terminal:  precodeopen . /code/pre  will open the current directory in Finder.  Unhiding it with:  precodesudo chflags nohidden dirname /code/pre  Does not work either. (Error -- chflags: dev/: Operation not supported)  <comment177309> What is the reasoning?  /dev doesn't contain actual files, it is just referencing devices connected to the machine.
