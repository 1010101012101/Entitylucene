MacBook Pro running El Capitan randomly boots me to login screen <body> It's only happened a couple of times thus far but just happened again tonight where my computer suddenly takes me to the login screen. I'll be doing something and suddenly I'm at the login screen where I need to select which user to sign in. Upon signing in some programs will reopen but others do not and information is lost.  I don't know much of anything about crash reports or anything but I believe this is the report from when my computer kicked me to the login screen.  It's too long to copy and paste here so I have uploaded a text file of the report here.  Any help in looking this over and offering an interpretation would be much appreciated as I have absolutely no idea what any of it is saying even after looking at various resources to try and help me decode/understand it.
