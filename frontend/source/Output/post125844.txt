Microsoft Word file is "being used by 'another user'" <body> Some MS Word DOCX files, and an occasional Excel XLSX file, appear to be open by another user when opened from a server volume. The error message is  precode"Filename" is being used by "another user". Do you want to make a copy?" /code/pre  The file isn't open anywhere else by any user. Running lsof on the server only shows the file open once, by the correct process.  The server is running OS X server 10.6.8 (an older XServe), the client machine is running 10.8, and the latest Office for Mac (2011).  <comment147332> Change the settings in those files. <comment147507> which settings, exactly? <comment147508> difficult to say, but how about using some common template, sharing ect. <comment147636> The documents aren't sharing a common template, and are often older documents that were created several years ago. The same document will cause problems one day, but not the next.
