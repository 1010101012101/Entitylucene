How to clear the cache or do a hard refresh in mobile Safari? <body> On OS-X it's kbdOpt/kbd+kbdCmd/kbd+kbdE/kbd or kbdCmd/kbd+kbdR/kbd or certain menu options (How to clear the cache or do a hard refresh in Safari?).  Is there a way to do this for Safari on an iPhone or iPad?  hr  This seems like a duplicate? What do you think? I really don't like force-quit: Can I force a cache refresh in Safari running on iOS?  This sounds better: How to clear browser cache for just one specific site in Mobile Safari?
