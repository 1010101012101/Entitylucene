Reverse Magic Trackpad (turn 180Â°) <body> Prior to Mavericks, one could reverse the direction of a Magic Trackpad, using the following codedefaults/code commands, and magic five-finger gesture to reorient.  precodedefaults write com.apple.trackpad.orientation TrackpadOrientationMode 1 sudo defaults write com.apple.MultitouchSupport ForceAutoOrientation YES /code/pre  You can find more information here and here. Unfortunately, this doesn't appear to work in Mavericks. Does anybody know a modern incantation to bring back the old magic?  NOTE: this is not the same as reversing the scroll direction. It completely reverses all input and gestures on trackpad.  hr  UPDATE: I got it to work. Ray Shan's "reboot the trackpad" might be part of the magic. Also, five fingers + hard click seems to be crucial to activate.  <answer136336> I just tried exactly same code, and it works for me in 10.9.3.  You can try reboot your Mac, naturally place your five fingers on trackpad. It should recognise right away. If you turn it around and place your 5 fingers again, it will turn again with it.  <answer156225> codesudo defaults write com.apple.MultitouchSupport ForceAutoOrientation YES/code did the trick for me on 10.9.5 (required a reboot). I haven't tried codedefaults write com.apple.trackpad.orientation TrackpadOrientationMode 1/code. Possibly the two methods are interacting strangely with each other?  <answer257897> This appears not to work anymore on MacOS 10.12 (Sierra). Corroboration from Apple discussion forum, here: https://discussions.apple.com/message/30704137#message30704137  <comment223617> Can confirm this still works in Yosemite 10.10.3. A reboot of the trackpad, not OS X, does the trick.

No luck for me. <comment301539> Just got it to work with OS X El Capitan `10.11.5`. Tried the 5-finger hard click before reboot and nothing happened. Turned off the trackpad, then turned it back on, still not; then did 5-finger hard click and it worked. So... (1) execute 2 commands, (2) power cycle, (3) 5-finger hard click. ... Of course I don't know if the 5-finger hard click before power-cycling was necessary. I assume not. <comment336472> A piece of software called [BetterTouchTool](https://www.boastr.net/) makes this possible in Sierra, as described [here](http://blog.pythonaro.com/2015/01/how-to-invert-apple-magic-trackpad.html).
