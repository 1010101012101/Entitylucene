How to transfer a large video (> 2 GB) from iPhone to a PC? <body> I have installed iTunes on my PC. However, when I click Photos â†’ Sync Photos, it says     You can choose which photos from your computer are copied to your iPhone.   It seems that it copies photos from the computer to the iPhone, but not the other way around.   strongQuestion:/strong How do I transfer a large video ( 2 GB) from an iPhone to a PC?  <answer235153> You can use the program iExplorer. It is free, and you can download it to view files on your iDevice. Simply plug in your phone, open iExplorer, and then on the sidebar, select Photos - Recorded Videos.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8Cd5Q.png" alt="Sidebar"  <answer235423> A method which works for me is to use Google Photos and a WiFi network.  I install Google Photos on my iPhone. When the iPhone is connected to a WiFi network, the video automatically gets uploaded to Google Photos.  After the video is uploaded and processed, I can simply download it from Google Photos onto my PC.  The shortcoming of this method is that it can be slow, and it can drain my iPhone battery. For example, it may take 1 hour to upload and process a 5 GB video to Google Photos, though it takes only about 5 minutes to download.  <comment287573> There are many support articles written by Apple, and other 3rd parties, on how to transfer files/photos from an iPhone to a PC.  Have you tried any of them?
