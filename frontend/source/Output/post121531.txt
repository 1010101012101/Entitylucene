Why do the files Iâ€™ve moved return to its previous location? <body> I moved some files from one folder on Desktop to another folder in Documents.  But after I put my MacBook Pro with OS X Mavericks to sleep, I found those files return to their original location.  What is the cause of it?  <comment141652> Are they in both locations now or *just* the original location? <comment141654> How did you move them? <comment141655> In the original location **only**. <comment141656> Drag & Drop.... <comment141657> So your question is, why doesn't it move instead of "still exists in original location". Edit: Are you using TotalFinder or any finder plugin? Edit2: Do you see them being moved, or don't they move at all? <comment141660> They appeared to be moved when I moved them but then they went back to their original location. I am not using any Finder plugins.
