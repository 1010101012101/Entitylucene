Time Machine and Volume backup issue after Sierra update <body> I have updated to 10.12.5 yesterday and I am facing some issues with Time Machine and volumes where the backups are stored. I used to have two Volumes where Time Machine backups are stored:  ol linetwork volume/li liusb drive/li /ol  The first problem I faced was that all the backups, either on network or on usb drive, stuck on "preparing backup" state.  I tried these solutions:  ol lireset Time Machine (removing /Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine.plist/li lireset SMC and NVRAM/li /ol  Nothing changed. Except for the fact that, since I reset Time Machine, my Volume with usb backup partition (HDMac) is not mountable anymore. Giving codesudo lsof | grep disk2s2/code I understood that system stuck on codefsck_hfs/code. While backup on network drive is still on "preparing backup".  Can anybody help me?  <answer291233> The solution for my problem was simply waiting for some hours in order to obtain the backup.   To repair my usb drive I ran codefsck_hfs -fy /dev/disks2/code.  <comment367680> Did you upgrade to Sierra from 10.11.x? This would change *a lot of* files which could result in a longer than usual preparation step <comment367681> @patrix: yes I updated from 10.11.x. But Time Machine stucks on "Preparing backup" for more than two hours. Is it a normal behavior? <comment367685> Hmm, it may take hours. And after resetting TM it may take longer if some of the disks need to be checked first <comment367686> @patrix ok, so I am going to wait. Thank you very much! <comment367689> If it is still stuck after a day please update the question accordingly so we can dig deeper. Good luck! <comment367690> @patrix it is just finished! So I can change the subject to Solve. Thanks again! <comment367692> If you've solved your problem, write an answer and accept it
