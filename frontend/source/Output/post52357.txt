How to determine original location of file that is currently in the Trash? <body> Suppose some file "Any File.pdf" is in the Trash (aka code~/.Trash/code).  How can I determine its original location?  By "original location" I mean the folder where that file would be moved to emif/em one were to apply the "Put Back" command to it (but emwithout/em actually doing so)?  (See figure below.)  (I had hoped that this information would be available through running "Get Info" on the file, but I did not find it there.)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ucYce.jpg" alt="Put Back"  <answer52367> 'Put Back' the File, Use the search function to search for the file, When you find your file, Right-Click it and select "Open Enclosing Folder"  <answer52855> Data containing a file's original location before being placed in the Trash is keep in the strong.DS_Store/strong file in the strong~/.Trash/strong folder.  Since the trash folder is hidden it can not normally be found using the finder application.  The easiest way to find this file is by using the Terminal and entering the following commands.  precode$cd ~/.Trash $open -e .DS_Store /code/pre  This will open the file in TextEdit.  From there you should be able to quickly search for the file by its name and its original path.  Its seems that files in .DS_Store follow the pattern of:  precodeFILE_NAME ptbLustr ORIGINAL_PATH_TO_FILE /code/pre  Note spaces are added just for readability.  <comment59884> As mentioned [here](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/7123/14994) (last comment) this information seems to be stored in the .DS_Store file in the trash-folder <comment59886> Related: http://superuser.com/questions/59376/how-to-tell-where-an-item-in-the-trash-came-from <comment59890> What if the same file name appears more than once on the file system? This approach will fail for that case. Better to read the meta data OS X is reading to determine the 'Put Back' location in the first place. <comment60446> Did you actually test that? .DS_Store contains a lot of binary data, I didn't find any file names at all. <comment60447> I did test this on my own machine before posting.  I found references to files in my Trash and their original locations. <comment60457> Ah, seems to depend on the language settings, it's all Unicode here. <comment219058> I believe this answer only works for OS X around/before 10.4 or 10.5 as .DS_Store is [now a binary file and undocumented by Apple](https://wiki.mozilla.org/DS_Store_File_Format). <comment282166> It does still work here in OS X 10.7.5. <comment331852> still works on OSX 10.11.5. It works when I open it in TextEdit, but not Sublime Text <comment340664> It is a binary file, but you can still see the strings that are stored in it, in most text editors. However, the search doesn't seem to work correctly on it when opened in TextEdit. I can see all my files there, but when I try to search for more than a single character at a time, it returns 0 results (even though if I search for those characters one at a time, it finds them all). This probably depends on the editor it's opened in, but TextWrangler is the same way. Unfortunately, without the search working, this method is pretty difficult to use. <comment372741> @David, Surely you're going to say waht ptbLustr means? <comment372748> @Elezar, Yes that's the definition of a binary file. There are readable text strings in loads of binary files. If its not completely unicode readable its binary. <comment372750> @IanC., But this hazytruth option seemsto be the only option now that dsstore is binary <comment372751> Fuzzytruth i mean... <comment372754> See soultion here https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5767821?tstart=0 **but it doesn't work if the enclosing folder has been deleted !** <comment372783> @Pacerier Yeah, but it seems pretty clear from other comments that not everyone is aware of that fact, so I was pointing it out.
