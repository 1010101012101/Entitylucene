iPad to view LAN local domains? <body> I have multiple local domains (i.e. localtest.local) that my iPad cannot see.  My machine name, alpha.local, has Apache directives to a "site" I have on the box.  All are in /Library/WebServer/Documents/, and I have other directives to many local domains.    I have an Airport Extreme router, which I think the iPad should get some answers from, but it doesn't have anything where I can shove this reference to.    Kind of stuck.  Any ideas how I can get my iPad to see localtest.local?  <answer71616> Truth is you should have a local DNS Server that you share out using DHCP to all your clients.  This way you can manage local DNS records on your local network.  I will confess there might be a better way, but this is what came to mind off the top of my head  <comment83487> Hi there.  I do have a local DNS.  I use internal static IP's using my DNS on a server internally.  I've entered the secondary zone for this "domain" localtest.local, and pointed it to my workstation.  Still no luck.
