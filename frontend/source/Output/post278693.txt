Dual Monitor Parallels - Clicking Windows on one display switches other display to Windows <body> Parallels 12 running Windows 10 as guest OS.  I have an external monitor - and am using my 12" MacBook as a display too.  When I have Windows on my Mac display - and MacOS on my external display (something I often need) - as soon as I click in Windows on the Mac display the external display automatically switches to Windows too.  This is infuriating - any ideas how to fix it? I think I fixed it before on another installation but I have no way to check.  thx
