Proper group ID (gid) for Lion? <body> If you create a brand new admin account in Lion, the following will be your id and group memberships (from code$ id [new Lion account] | perl -lne 's/ /\n/g; s/,/\n\t/g; print;'/code):  precodeuid=504(lt) gid=20(staff) groups=20(staff)     402(com.apple.sharepoint.group.1)     12(everyone)     33(_appstore)     61(localaccounts)     79(_appserverusr)     80(admin)     81(_appserveradm)     98(_lpadmin)     100(_lpoperator)     204(_developer)     403(com.apple.sharepoint.group.2)     401(com.apple.access_screensharing) /code/pre  In contrast, an older OS X account will have these uid, gid, etc:  precodeuid=501(andrew) gid=501(andrew) groups=501(andrew)     403(com.apple.sharepoint.group.2)     204(_developer)     100(_lpoperator)     98(_lpadmin)     81(_appserveradm)     80(admin)     79(_appserverusr)     61(localaccounts)     12(everyone)     401(com.apple.access_screensharing)     402(com.apple.sharepoint.group.1) /code/pre  Note that the codegid=20(staff)/code on the newer account and the that user is a member of code20(staff)/code.   strongWhen you upgrade an older account to Lion, the older user and group names are kept./strong  There have been issues reported with not having codestaff/code group membership on upgraded accounts:  ol liInability to install or upgrade Homebrew;/li liThe display of 'Fetching' when pressing kbdCmd/kbd+kbdI/kbd on files in your user folder/li liACL and permission issues./li /ol  The current workaround seems to be this:  ol liAdd the user to staff (i.e.: $ sudo dscl . append /Groups/staff GroupMembership `whoami` or equivalent)/li liUse Lion Recovery to restore default home folder permissions (Click on the 'No Disc – Lion' tab). /li /ol  So far, this has fixed a lot of the issues I had with the upgrade, and I seem to have longer battery life and lower CPU usage.  However, here are the questions I have:   strong1. Should I go through the trouble of changing the codegid=501/code to codegid=20/code on my account or is just being a member of the group staff good enough?/strong  strong2. Is being a member of 20(staff) the same as having gid=20(staff)?/strong  strong3. If I did change the codegid=/code part of my account, how do I do that on Lion? I only know how to do it on Ubuntu.../strong  <answer28548> I fear there is no easy answer on that:  ul liwhen accessing files it doesn't matter whether your gid is codestaff/code or you are just member of this group/li liwhen creating files it emmight/em matter because new files belong to you but get the group from the directory they are created in. But because the file is owned by you in this case you should be able to access it anyway/li /ul  For most practical purposes belonging to the group is probably enough (especially as your problems seem to be resolved currently).   <answer28568> I haven't seen any difference in how OS X treats the primary group vs. a user's other groups, so I don't think it makes any real difference.  I'd be inclined to "fix" it for neatness, though.  These commands should set the primary group to 20, and then add a "secondary" membership in the old andrew group:  precodesudo dscl . create /Users/andrew PrimaryGroupID 20 sudo dseditgroup -o edit -a andrew -t user andrew /code/pre  (Note: using dscl to add secondary group memberships doesn't quite do it right -- use dseditgroup instead.)  <comment32838> Thanks. How would I use `dscl` to change the gid? <comment32845> This is true on some unixes, but not OS X; on OS X files inherit their group assignment from the parent folder, not based on the user's primary group. <comment32910> Fabulous!!! This fixed the issue. You need to reboot (or log out / in from your account) or `id` will show that `egid=501` until you do. Thanks!!! <comment33080> @Gordon: indeed, thanks for the info <comment94010> If you're like me, then you'll need this: `sudo dscl . delete /users/andrew`. <comment94021> @raxacoricofallapatorius: that deletes the entire user record -- you probably don't want to do that. <comment94022> @GordonDavisson: If forgot, at first, to substitute your user name for `andrew` (as I did!) — that's exactly what you want.
