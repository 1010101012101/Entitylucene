Mailto links on websites open iTerm instead of Mail <body> In both Chrome and Safari codemailto:/code links open up strongiTerm/strong instead of strongMail/strong.  This seemed to have started happening right around the same time I added a shortcut through emSettings  Keyboard  Shortcuts  App Shortcuts/em to use codecommand+enter/code to emSend/em in the Mail app.   But I have no idea if that has anything to do with this problem, or where else to even begin looking.  <answer170573> You can set the default Mail application, via strongMail.app/strong Preferences.  It is underneath the "strongGeneral/strong" settings, as "strongDefault email reader/strong".  Even if Mail.app appears to be already selected it might be worth a shot to select something else, then go back to Mail.app in order to clear the cobwebs.  <comment200534> You nailed it! No idea how or why it got set to iTerm but changing it back to mail.app fixed it :-) <comment286765> This didn't fix it for me, it simply reverts back to iTerm2 :/ <comment286779> You should make a new question, with your situation. The solution likely involves file permissions but you can supply more details in your own question.
