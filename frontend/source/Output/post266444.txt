Created new contact on OS X in iMessage, did not sync to iPhone <body> I created a new contact card on my OS X machine in order to associate a phone number with a name.   This works, but my iPhone did not sync this information. So when I get texts from this person I still just see their phone number.  There are many ways to manually sync the contact, which I eventually did using airdrop.  But the main issue is that the contact must have been added to some "account", and this account for whatever reason failed to be synced to the iPhone even after several days.   I found it impossible to identify which particular "account" (be it iCloud or gmail or linkedin) that a particular contact card is associated with. This makes it impossible to get to the root of the syncing problem.   For next time, I will remember to create the contact on the phone instead.
