Magic Trackpad loses connection after sleep and doesn't connect again <body> I'm running on Sierra 10.12 my Magic Trackpad 2 is losing his connection after my Mac entered in sleep.  The most strange is that if I restart my Mac without settings intervention, the Trackpad will reconnect automatically without any problem...  PS : The issue was not resolved with this tread  Bluetooth Magic Trackpad not recognized after sleep  <comment320619> Any chance there's another computer nearby that's hijacking the connection when your Mac goes to sleep? <comment320626> Nop, my trackpad is only paired to my Personal and Work computer.. Actually I'm using it at work, so it's about 8km from the other one ^^ <comment356786> I'm experiencing the same with my Magic Trackpad 2.  My Apple Wireless Keyboard auto-connects but for some reason the Magic Trackpad doesn't.  Each time I want to use it I have to connect it manually.  Both are only paired with one machine and always in the same place.
