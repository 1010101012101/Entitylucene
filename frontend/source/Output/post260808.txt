iTunes does not transfer random albums <body> I have an iPhone 6s. Both my iOS and iTunes are updated (albeit my mac is still running El Captain). I have disabled the "Synchronize Music Automatically" since my music library on my mac is way too big for the iPhone; so I manually put the albums I want.   The problem is that for certain albums, nothing happens. I put them on the iPhone, and it's like I did nothing. I go the iPhone panel in iTunes, click "Synchronize", and still the albums are missing in my iPhone. This also happens when I put some songs (but only if I put them one by one; if it puts an album, all the songs are there). This is completely random; I have like 5/6 albums of a certain singer, and when I put a new one this happens and I can't listen to it.   The albums in question can be listened perfectly fine on my mac (so it's not a question of corrupted files) and they even got transferred properly in my old iPhone (the apple store just changed it because of unrelated issues; it was also an iPhone 6s)  What could be the problem? How can I solve this?
