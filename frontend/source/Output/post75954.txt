Installing VMware on MacBook - Free version <body> I need to install Windows 8 on my MacBook. So I am hoping to install VMware and then install Windows 8 on top of it.  I need to know if I need to install VMware Player or VMware Fusion? I am using this for non-commercial use so I require a free version.  Note: VMware Fusion is a licensed version, and I don't want to use it.  <answer75963> VMware Player is only avaiable for Windows and Linux, not OS X. To install Windows 8 on your Mac, you will need to purchase VMware Fusion.  From VMware Workstation Player (formerly known as Player Pro):     VMware Player is the easiest way to run multiple operating systems at the same time on your PC.   You do have a couple of free options:  ul liVirtualbox is a free program that will allow you to install Windows 8 alongside OS X in the same way that VMware Fusion works (you can run both OSs concurrently)./li liApple's own Boot Camp software will allow you to install Windows in a separate partition. The downside to this is you have to reboot your computer to switch between OSs, but the upside is that you can run more graphically-intense programs (i.e. games) at native speeds./li /ul  <comment162648> Correction: VMWare is NOT a Windows-only application. It also supports Linux. <comment162654> Nice, has it always supported Linux or is that fairly recent? Updated my answer to reflect that, thanks! <comment162716> According to my experience, it has the same functionality as the Windows version. <comment162725> At least it was available since version 2.0.
