Redownloading iWork for iPad apps without paying for them <body> I bought an iPad Air 2 fourteen months ago. Recently I reset my iPad and now Pages, Keynote, and Numbers are not free â€” they ask for payment. How can I download them again without paying?  I tried to switch my iPad off and on and I tried another Apple ID, but neither of those worked. My device is fully upgraded to iOS 10.2.  <answer267946> When you set up your iPad and downloaded these apps, the iPad would have asked you to sign in to iTunes &amp; App Store, then registered the apps to this Apple ID as it was the first used to download them. You must use this strongsame/strong Apple ID to re-download the apps later.  <comment336261> Did you try with the Apple ID you initially used when setting up the iPad/logging into the Store? <comment336263> Do they show up in the Purchased tab? <comment336266> Also, have you ever synced your iPad to iTunes? <comment336268> Just to verify, you bought the iPad new or was it already set up by someone else? <comment336269> To clarify all the above comments - all apps [as well as the device itself] on iOS belong to the Apple ID that first downloaded them. if you have multiple IDs [not wise] then you need to sign in to the one that first purchased the app.
