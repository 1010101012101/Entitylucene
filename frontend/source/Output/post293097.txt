What happens if I cancel/downgrade my iCloud storage plan? <body> I have more media that can possibly be stored on my iPhone, so I assume that most of it is stored in iCloud and downloaded when required (when I view it).   What happens if I cancel/downgrade my iCloud storage plan?  How do they decide what media is going to be deleted, so that the amount falls within the free plan?   Is there a time period where I can cancel and then sign back up and it'll be as if nothing has happened?  <answer293100> You will be able to access and clean up your iCloud storage, but some services will be unavailable for you.     If you downgrade your storage plan and your content exceeds the   storage you have available, new photos and videos won't upload to   iCloud Photo Library and your devices stop backing up to iCloud.   iCloud Drive and the other apps that you use with iCloud wonâ€™t update   across your devices. You can't send or receive messages with your   iCloud email address. Learn how to manage your storage by deleting   backups, documents, photos, and email messages that you don't need   anymore. If you cancel your plan or you don't renew it, you'll   automatically go back to 5GB of free storage.   https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201318  <comment369801> Hi. So does data ever forcibly get deleted? It's just that I won't be able to add any more to it? <comment369803> @user6888062 If I understand it correctly, data will not be removed. But this policy may be changed by Apple any moment in future. <comment369806> And I didn't test this behavior at all, just found a link to an official resource.
