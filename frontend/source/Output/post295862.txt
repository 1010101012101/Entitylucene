Macbook Pro won't connect to internet via Wi-Fi or ethernet <body> Macbook Pro 2011 A1278 13" OS X 10.9.5  I cannot connect to Wi-Fi, the Wi-Fi symbol in the top right has a cross through it and when i click it says "Wi-Fi: No hardware installed". I've tried connecting to the internet via ethernet, when I plug in the ethernet cable it says connected under "network" but the internet doesn't work - pages won't load in safari, app store won't connect etc.  I've tried resetting the NVRAM and SMC.  Thanks.  <answer295879> The first thing I would try is removing your Wi-Fi service, restarting your MBP, and then adding your Wi-Fi service back.  Follow these steps:  ol liGo to strongApple  System Preferences  Network/strong/li liSelect the Wi-Fi service on the left-hand side/li liClick on the cog icon at bottom-left and select Make Service Inactive/li liNow delete the service by clicking on the minus sign (i.e. the kbd-/kbd button) at left of the cog/li liClick on the kbdApply/kbd button/li liExit Network preferences/li liRestart your MBP/li liGo to strongApple  System Preferences  Network/strong/li liClick on the plus sign (i.e. the kbd+/kbd button) at left of the cog/li liIn the pop-up window, ensure that Wi-Fi is selected from the drop-down menu/li liClick on the kbdCreate/kbd button/li liMake sure Wi-Fi is on and connected (it should remember your previous settings, but if not just re-add your Wi-Fi network again)/li /ol  If this doesn't work you can test to see what happens in Safe Mode.  strongBoot into Safe Mode/strong   ol liFully shut down your MBP /li liRestart your MBP/li liImmediately press the kbdShift/kbd key and strongkeep it down/strong /li liLet go of the kbdShift/kbd key when you see the login window (NOTE: If you  have FileVault enabled you may need to log in twice). /li liTest to see what happens (i.e. try connecting to Wi-Fi)/li liExit Safe Mode by restarting your MBP as normal /li liTest again to see what happens/li /ol  strongNote:/strong Booting into Safe Mode will take longer than usual.  If you're still having problems during Safe Mode, then try testing your hardware.  strongRun Apple Hardware Test/strong  Your model MBP uses Apple Hardware Test. To use this, follow these steps:  ol liShut down your MacBook Pro /li liRestart your MacBook Pro/li liPress and hold the kbdD/kbd key before the gray startup screen appears./li liAfter a while, Apple Hardware Test (AHT) will start./li liWhen prompted, select your language and click the right arrow. /li liWhen the AHT console appears, you can choose to run Basic tests by clicking the Test button. However, I suggest you select the "Perform extended testing" checkbox before you click the Test button./li liYour test results will appear in the window in the bottom-right of the console./li /ol  strongNote 1:/strong The extended test will take some time. Take a note of the results and report back.   strongNote 2:/strong If pressing and holding the kbdD/kbd key at Step 3 doesn't work, start again at Step 1 and, at Step 3 press and hold both the kbdOption/kbdkbdD/kbd keys instead. This will try and run diagnostics from the internet instead, so you will need to allow more time for it to complete.  strongRun these Terminal commands/strong  Let's confirm what macOS believes the status of your Wi-Fi service is. To do this:  ol liLaunch Terminal (usually found in Applications  Utilities)/li liEnter the following command:  codesudo networksetup -listallnetworkservices/code/li liPress kbdEnter/kbd/li liEnter your password (note you will not see the cursor move, nor the characters appear on the screen)/li /ol  Now, in the list that appears I assume you will see an asterisk (*) next to the Wi-Fi service. This denotes that it is currently disabled. Assuming this is what happens, let's try enabling it as follows:  ol liMake sure you're still in Terminal/li liEnter the following command:  codenetworksetup -setnetworkserviceenabled Wi-Fi on/code/li liA popup will prompt you for your password - enter it and click on the kbdModify Configuration/kbd button /li liNow enter this command:  codenetworksetup -setairportpower en0 on/code/li liRestart your Mac/li liNow check System Preferences  Network again/li /ol  Let me know how you go.  <answer295887> The error message that macOS/OS X supplies is the key:     strongthe Wi-Fi symbol in the top right has a cross through it and when i   click it says "Wi-Fi: No hardware installed"/strong   It simply cannot find it to configure it. Unfortunately, there's not a VRAM or setting file that will fix a failed board.  An SMC reset won't have any effect because it's connected via the PCI bus which means if the SMC was failing, pretty much everything else on your MBP would be failing; the SMC controls power delivery to the whole PCI bus, not just individual parts.   The good news is that its fairly inexpensive and something you can repair yourself (Apple PN# 661-5867)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/d693nm.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Ifixit.com has an excellent step-by-step tutorial with pictures that walk you through the replacement.  They even sell the plastic spudger tools shown in the example.  With a little patience and time, you can fix this without having to incur massive costs from a repair shop.  As for your Ethernet, that's technically a completely different issue; it's different hardware altogether but emstill part of the PCI bus/em (this is why SMC reset has no effect).  When the OS reports back that it's "connected" it's saying that it has "found and made a connection."  To verify this, type codeifconfig en0/code and you should get something emsimilar/em to this (your's will have different values):  precodeen0: flags=8963&lt;UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,PROMISC,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500         options=10b&lt;RXCSUM,TXCSUM,VLAN_HWTAGGING,AV&gt;         ether a8:20:44:18:3b:2d          inet 192.168.1.13 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.1.255         nd6 options=1&lt;PERFORMNUD&gt;         media: autoselect (1000baseT &lt;full-duplex,flow-control,energy-efficient-ethernet&gt;)         status: active /code/pre  The important value here is codeinet/code.  If you don't get a valid IP address, it just means that DHCP didn't assign you one.  A reboot will usually fix the issue.  <comment373663> When going through your instructions, when I get to the 10th bullet point there is no Wi-Fi option in the drop down menu, only Thunderbolt Bridge, Thunderbolt 1, Bluetooth PAN, FireWire, Ethernet, Bluetooth DUN, VPN, PPPoE, and 6 to 4. <comment373666> Okay, I've added some terminal commands you can try as well. <comment373667> When I run `sudo networksetup -listallnetworkservices` it lists Bluetooth DUN, ethernet and Wi-Fi but there is no asterisk next to Wi-Fi <comment373669> some additional info - when I go into system preferences  Network, it lists Wi-Fi Off, when I click Turn Wi-Fi on, the status remains off. <comment373673> I thought this might be the case, however the bluetooth works fine. If the airport card had failed, wouldn't it be the case that bluetooth would also not work? <comment373674> Not necessarily.  The wireless "chip" may be fine, it may just be a simple component on the wireless card PCB that died - it could be a $0.02 resistor or diode that gave up the ghost.  Her's a [pic of the back of the PCB](https://d3nevzfk7ii3be.cloudfront.net/igi/ghcsRtXQTDeEnNoV.huge).  Any of those components could have failed. <comment373675> Interesting, thanks for your help, I'll give this a go.
