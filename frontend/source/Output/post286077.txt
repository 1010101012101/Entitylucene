How to remove Sophos app <body> I want to deleted an application through single user mode.  I put in these commands  precodecd /Applications ls -latrsq rm -rf Sophos\Anti Virus.app (this is the application i want to delete) /code/pre  When I put this in it says it's a read only file system and when i go to change to read/write I go to the "get info" bit but it resets.   So I tried using terminal but then it says unknown file system.  How can I remove this application?  <comment360867> can you put exactly what you seen in the terminal <comment360876> You are aware that antivirus apps really object to being manually uninstalled. It's not just an app. Use the uninstaller - https://community.sophos.com/kb/en-us/120838
