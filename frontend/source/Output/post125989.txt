How to create a bootable Mavericks dvd (double layer)? <body> my macbook's hard-drive is dead so i bought a new one and i'm looking for a way to install os X on it.  Is it possible to download mavericks on an imac running 10.6.8 and create a bootable dvd ?  Thanks  <answer125995> You could use Diskmaker X obtainable from http://liondiskmaker.com to make a bootable memory key.  <comment147526> possible duplicate of [How do I make a bootable USB flash drive for a MacBook Air?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/7152/how-do-i-make-a-bootable-usb-flash-drive-for-a-macbook-air) <comment147534> The link in the comment above shows how to make a bootable USB flash drive.
