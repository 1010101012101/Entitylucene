Is there a Non-Retina Macbook Pro 2015? <body> I want to buy a new MacBook Pro and I'm wondering if there's a non-retina MacBook Pro 2015.  I'm asking this because on the compare Mac models page (http://www.apple.com/mac/compare/), there's a Non-Retina MacBook Pro, is it 2015 or all 2015 are always retina?  <answer211874> No, the non-Retina models are 2012.  <comment255831> But why apple is still selling 2012 macbooks. I mean why there's a non-retina macbook pro on the main compare page? <comment255833> @user Because Apple hasn't updated that line of MacBooks since 2012. They're still sold and supported by Apple, hence they're still on the site.
