Applescript Service Won't Run From Some Applications <body> Okay, so I have a non-Apple keyboard and wanted to bind function keys to the basic media controls such as play/pause iTunes, change volume etc. So I decided to create a service in Automator with an Applescript task to perform the desired action, these are all configured for no input and availability of "Any application".  Here's a simple example for the play/pause iTunes script that I'm placing into the Automator workflow:  precodeon run {input, parameters}     tell application "iTunes"         if player state is not playing then             play         else             pause         end if     end tell  end run /code/pre  This seems simple enough, and once saved it appears under System Preferences - Keyboard - Shortcuts - Services where I can set a shortcut key such as F1.  However, while the command works fine from a few applications such as Safari, the Finder and iTunes itself, it won't work at all in Mail, and actually doesn't work in Automator!  Instead of the script running, I just get a system beep sound. At first I assumed the problem was that these apps assigned other commands to the function keys, but as far as I can tell that isn't the case (unless I've missed some commands), so I'm at a loss as to why my shortcuts aren't working.  Is there something else that could be preventing my script(s) from triggering?  <comment187942> For those experiencing the same trouble, I found a program called BetterTouchTool; it's a free app that lets you configure a wide range of shortcuts and even enables a Windows style window snapping feature. I'd still like to know why I can't get Applescript to work, but this app solves the problem (and is better in many ways).
