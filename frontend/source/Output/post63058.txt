My Mac wont connect to a new wifi network <body> So I moved to a new place for my university and I attempted to connect to the wifi network. My HP laptop was able to connect instantly once I put in the wifi password. My Mac recognizes the network but when I put in the same password it says the password is invalid.   I have checked and double checked to make sure I have the right password a million times. Any reason why it's not connecting? My OS X version is 10.6.8.  <comment72791> Have you checked Console for messages from the Network subsystem? Might shed some light on the issue. <comment72793> For some reason when I checked an hour later, the Wifi I was trying to connect to had two separate channels. I tried both and one of them connected with the Mac. Any reason why there was only one Wifi before but there is two now? Just curious in-case i have another issue. <comment72822> Now when i checked later tonight, the wifi that I connected to no longer exists. I really need to get internet for my classes. Any way to get a quick fix? I checked the console and it says nothing. <comment72823> When I check the Airport in System Profiler, it lists the two different wifi. But when I search with my Airport, it cannot find this second wifi.
