Save program from iPad to Mac <body> I bought some program for iPad and this program became crucial for my work - if the iPad will corrupt/+developer delete the program from AppStore I will be in great trouble.   So, my question is how can I save the program from iPad to MBP (from MBP to external HDD) to prevent any future corruptions of the program/store etc. Could I reinstall the program back to any new iPad from HDD only (if it will be unaccessible from Appstore).   <answer143691> You can log into your iTunes Store account in iTunes on the Mac and download the app there. As long as you have a copy on your Mac you can always sync it to your iPad if required.  The code.ipa/code file (the app) is stored in code/Users/&lt;youruser&gt;/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Mobile Applications/code, the name may need some guessing. You can also right-click on the app icon directly in the App view in iTunes and select "Show in Finder"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Tk7hM.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment169240> thanks, but I cannot see the program in AppStore application on Mac (the program is for iPad only), this is why I asked the question. <comment169243> @Ilan The app will be in iTunes App Store, not the Mac App Store, and the downloaded ipa can be synced later. <comment169244> @GeorgeGarside ok, I see the app in iTunes store, but there is no any button to download it :( <comment169245> @Ilan [Image](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Xrafi.jpg) <comment169300> @GeorgeGarside unfortunately, I don't have any option to download, no matter what I try. How do you upload pics? I will post to show what i see <comment169301> @Ilan Use the image uploader in the question editor to upload the image and get a link which you can post in a comment. <comment169304> @GeorgeGarside this is what I see on mac - http://i.stack.imgur.com/u6Iky.png <comment169308> @Ilan Click the app icon to go to the screen shown in my screenshot <comment169309> @GeorgeGarside :) it does not change :( http://i.stack.imgur.com/TyWBk.png <comment169318> @Ilan you already have the app on your computer, otherwise you won't see it on the screenshot <comment169319> @patrix :) I did not download these apps to MBP. Any way, where do you think I should search for them on MBP? i'll check <comment169321> @ilan they got synced automatically when you synced your iPad <comment169322> @patrix is there a way to know 100% that the program was saved to mbp? while in sync i was sure this prog was skipped
