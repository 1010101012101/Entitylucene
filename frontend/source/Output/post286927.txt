Get both file contents AND file name via Automator <body> I have about 1000+ Word files in a folder. It is easy to combine the text of all of these files in one big Word file, but I would like Automator to strongalso/strong add the respective file names to this big file. Hence, I will know from which file the text originates.  So, how do you tell Automator to extract the text from each file strongand/strong also always add the file name right after the text (or before it) in the new big file?  <comment362160> Be careful creating one big Word file!
