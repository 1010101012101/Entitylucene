Can I write a script to take an action right before the computer is going to go to sleep? <body> I think my computer is randomly not syncing email correctly with Apple Mail, but it's only a problem when it wakes from sleep.  That issue is neither here nor there. What I'd like to do is write a script / something that will quit Apple Mail if it detects that the computer is going to sleep.  Ideally, there'd be a similar process to open Apple Mail upon waking from sleep, but that's less of an issue.  I tried looking for a system event library of some kind, but all I can find is fsevents (which I don't think has anything about sleep).  Thanks!  <answer176637> I suggest using a daemon like SleepWatcher. Once you’ve installed SleepWatcher (ref. the README included with it), you can run commands like the following.  precode/usr/local/sbin/sleepwatcher -s /path/to/sleepscript -w /path/to/wakeupscript /code/pre  The script  precode#!/bin/sh osascript -e 'quit app "Mail"' /code/pre  will quit Mail, and the script  precode#!/bin/sh open -a /Applications/Mail.app $1 /code/pre  will open it. You can save these as code.sh/code files and reference them from sleepwatcher, but ensure you run codechmod +x filename.sh/code on them before you try running them. Otherwise, OS X won’t recognize them as executable.  Now, you have two options for loading sleepwatcher: you can manually run it, you can configure a LaunchAgent to do so. I like the latter, so create a file in code/Library/LaunchAgents//code named codecom.custom.mailfix.plist/code (the name is unimportant, but I recommend you keep the formatting, the “com” and the “plist”). The file’s contents should resemble the following.  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict&gt; &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt; &lt;string&gt;com.custom.mailfix.plist&lt;/string&gt; &lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt; &lt;array&gt;     &lt;string&gt;/usr/local/sbin/sleepwatcher&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;string&gt;&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;string&gt;-s /path/to/sleepscript&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;string&gt;-w /path/to/wakescript&lt;/string&gt; &lt;/array&gt; &lt;key&gt;RunAtLoad&lt;/key&gt; &lt;true/&gt; &lt;key&gt;KeepAlive&lt;/key&gt; &lt;true/&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  As before, replace the script paths with paths to your shell scripts. To tell OS X to launch this agent at startup, run  precodesudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchAgents/com.custom.mailfix.plist /code/pre  <comment208624> and then what? could you be bit more precise, not just a link. <comment208672> I’ve edited my answer to be more specific. Sorry about that!
