CanÂ´t mount encrypted external hdd after encryption was interrupted <body> After I plug the disk it requests the password, I enter it and then it says it is not readable by my computer.  Then with Terminal I ask codediskutil cs list/code and displays that info about the volume (see below.) Can anyone interpret this for me?  Is it possible for me to be able to recover my info?   precodeLogical Volume Group FFC77AC9-4B24-4D6B-9CD2-6EC58562423B ========================================================= Name:         LaCie 4 Status:       Online Size:         5000532242432 B (5.0 TB) Free Space:   18919424 B (18.9 MB) | +-&lt; Physical Volume BF23ACC1-74C9-41D4-B9D6-6C3D6985883E |   ---------------------------------------------------- |   Index:    0 |   Disk:     disk2s2 |   Status:   Online |   Size:     5000532242432 B (5.0 TB) | +-&gt; Logical Volume Family ED69BA8E-B63F-4CDE-87EE-D36EF1BE96B9     ----------------------------------------------------------     Encryption Type:         AES-XTS     Encryption Status:       Unlocked     Conversion Status:       Pending     High Level Queries:      Not Fully Secure     |                        Passphrase Required     |                        Accepts New Users     |                        Has Visible Users     |                        Has Volume Key     |     +-&gt; Logical Volume 37A4053B-08AE-4595-AA9A-67DEBEBC6C3B         ---------------------------------------------------         Disk:                  disk3         Status:                Online         Size (Total):          5000161001472 B (5.0 TB)         Conversion Progress:   Paused         Revertible:            Yes (no decryption required)         LV Name:               LaCie 4         Content Hint:          Apple_HFS /code/pre  <answer280127> A reboot usually un-pauses conversion, so I would try that first. Consider storing the passphrase in your keychain (even if temporarily) so that it mounts when you log in and gets going on conversion after the restart.   You are doing it perfectly - looking at codediskutil cs list/code and checking the "Conversion Progress" and "Conversion Status" fields.  A restart might be overkill, you could try:  precodediskutil eject disk3 diskutil eject disk2 /code/pre  Once both the logical and physical volumes are detached, you could disconnect physically the drive and then wait a slow count or two and then reconnect.  <comment352360> Thanks for your input bmike... regrettably, same status.. :-(
