How do I remove the 802.1X settings in Mountain Lion <body> I made a stupid 802.1X settings file some time ago to test some things. Now I am unable to remove it, even though I think I have deleted the file.  The picture below shows the 802.1X profile to the bottom right. How do I delete this profile? I've tried removing the ethernet with the minus sign in the left menu, but once I try to make a new ethernet profile, that 802.1X setting shows up as the standard.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rt3o8.png" alt="enter image description here"  Here is the picture of the 802.1X settings: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ID5W1.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer101995> What you are doing when you click the minus sign is disabling the ethernet port completely.  Instead, I think you want to remove an 802.1X configuration.  If you click the codeAdvanced.../code button, a sheet will display with various tabs across the top.  One of those is strong802.1X/strong  On the left side of the 802.1X display, you can add or delete profiles.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IQGcN.png" alt="Screenshot of 10.6 Network settings" This screenshot is from 10.6.8; but, the principle is the same for 10.8  <answer125900> If you open the dropdown, you can choose strongedit/strong, there you can create a new stronglocation/strong. In the new location, all settings should be on default, so your 802.1X setting shouldn't be there anymore.  <answer175698> Try codeSystem Preferences &gt; Profiles/code. It listed my 802.1X profiles and I was able to remove them from there.   Alternatively, you can manually edit configuration files in code/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/code (see this post) - codegrep/code the files located there for the name of your profile.  (Using OS X Mavericks)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Q23ZJ.png" alt="enter image description here"  (Profiles is located in the second row from the bottom)  <answer243502> I had the same issue and followed the advice to grep codeeduroam/code in code/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/code.br The file I had to modify was codecom.apple.network.eapolclient.configuration.plist/code. In this file you can actually see, the migrated profiles.  <answer248736> I just Restarted my Laptop, and it was back to normal again.  <answer248742> The 802.1X configuration is protected with codeKeychain/code.  To remove it,  select a network configuration which isn't using your 802.1X setting.  Then open codeKeychain Access/code (within codeApplications/Utilities/code).  Unlock it. Select the codelogin/code keychains, and search for codelabsenteret_peap/code which should be of kind code802.1X Password/code.  Select it, remove it.  Quit codeKeychain Access/code.  Modify your network configuration.  And to help you manage these network configuration in the future, give it a name better than codeLocation (9/13/12 9:48AM)/code. For example: codelab. connection / Ethernet/code  <comment120152> I added a picture to show what it looks like in 10.8 <comment120153> Oh... looks like I spoke too soon.  I don't know where the profile's minus sign went to in 10.8   What happens if you control-click (right-click) the profile in your list? <comment120154> Nothing happens. <comment120155> You might try this: http://support.apple.com/kb/PH11323   It seems Apple has moved the configuration out of the Networks pane and into the Profiles pane? <comment120157> @TheUnfunCat please make a screenshot with Command-Shift-4, release the keys, then press the spacebar and click the window. This hurts my eyes!

I suspect one needs to use the command line. <comment147376> If you open the dropdown, you can choose "edit", there you can create a new "location". In the new "location", all settings should be on default, so your 802.1X setting shouldn't be there anymore. <comment207317> Thanks for your reply. Please add OS info. <comment308427> Cannot test this due, but accepting until sb comes up with something better. Thanks. :) <comment308448> Why can't you do it? Please, don't vote for my answer as long as no one tested it with Mountain Lion. I can't because I dont use Mountain Lion anymore. <comment308449> Where did you get `System Preferences  Profiles`? I don't see it on Mavericks & Yosemite. <comment308455> See my updated answer <comment364871> The `/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration` solution works in macOS Sierra as well. The file in question was `com.apple.network.eapolclient.configuration.plist` in my case. Emptying the file (after a backup) and restarting macOS did the job.
