change the command+tab and command+` behavior in Mountain Lion <body> When it is a switch between applications, we use kbdCommand/kbd+kbdTab/kbd, and when it is a switch within an application, we use kbdCommand/kbd+kbd`/kbd.  Can I just use kbdCommand/kbd+kbdTab/kbd for all cases, as in Windows?  <answer62436> You can't do that in OS X, but you can buy and install witch for that function.  <comment72119> Related questions: [1](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2718) [2](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/29130) [3](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/10502) [4](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/58541) [5](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/20169) [6](http://superuser.com/questions/45310) [7](http://superuser.com/questions/364315) [8](http://superuser.com/questions/62390)
