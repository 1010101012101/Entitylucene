OS X Internet Recovery doesn't see SSD drive <body> I wanted to do a clean install and booted from OS X recovery partition. In disk utility I selected "erase" option. SSD was working correctly before that.  Now, if i startup, the only way to proceed is with Internet Recovery  since I cannot boot from hidden recovery partition. After I wait several hours for the recovery image download, I cannot see the SSD either in disk utility or OSX reinstallation.   In terminal   precodediskutil list /code/pre  Shows only recovery image 1.8 Gb or so.  So did erase option destroy my ssd?  <comment304540> Can you try running [Apple Hardware Test (AHT)](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201257).  Hold the D key while booting from a powered off state with the AC adapter connected.    You can also try to Reset the [SMC](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201295) (Different procedure depending on Mac Model).  You can also try to reset the [NVRAM](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204063) Cmd+Opt+P+R while turning on the computerand continue holding until you hear the chimes twice. <comment304545> Thank you. I've already tried to reset NVRAM and SMC and it didn't help.I have MacBook Air 13' Mid 2011, which ships with Lion (10.7). Holding D during start-up process opens up Internet Recovery with rotating globe. Im waiting for it to complete, since in the article about AHT it says models with 10.7 come only with internet version of AHT. <comment304546> Let me know what happens. <comment304547> After some time, screen went black with flashing symbol "_". It was like that for 5 minutes and then MacBook restarted and started to show flashing question mark and folder <comment304548> You may need Disk 2 of the original installation disks <comment308951> Seems like SSD died. I ended up buying new one OWC.
