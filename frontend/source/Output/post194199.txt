Can't download song that shows as "purchased" <body> I recently purchased 6 songs to round out an album. I did this purchase from my phone (iPhone 6, iOS 8.4). Now, one of those six songs is missing from my phone, and I can't figure out how to re-download it.  Exhibit A shows the song as "purchased" in the iTunes Store app. Exhibit B shows that the track, #13, is missing from the album.  How can I get this song back on my phone?  strongEdit:/strong This song is also missing from iTunes on my mac, where all the other purchases have shown up due to iTunes Match. Where did it go?  h3Misc:/h3  I haven't connected to my PC or knowingly altered the music on my phone.  IIRC, the song was downloaded, I definitely listened to it a couple times.  I also have made sure that songs not-available-offline will still show up by setting the option for "Show Music Available Offline" to off.  I am a subscriber to iTunes Match.  Under Settings-Music I have "iCloud Music Library" enabled  I do not have an Apple Music subscription nor free trial.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uF9nb.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Gu1xq.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment231593> How much Available storage do you have?
