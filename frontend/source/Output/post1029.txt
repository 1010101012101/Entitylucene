Finding Firefox bookmarks in Spotlight <body> Is there a program that will allow me to use Spotlight to search my Firefox bookmarks and open the browser window?  <answer1067> ul liFirst, download this file to your desktop: ffmd.sh/li liOpen a terminal, and run the following:/li /ul     sudo mkdir /usr/localbr   sudo mkdir /usr/local/binbr   sudo mv ~/Desktop/ffmd.sh   /usr/local/bin/br   sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/ffmd.shbr   sudo chown root:wheel   /usr/local/bin/ffmd.sh   ul liNow, schedule the task with crontab. The following line will schedule for 10 minutes: /li /ul     0,10,20,30,40,50 * * * *   /usr/local/bin/ffmd.sh  /dev/null   2&amp;1   This script is in the public domain, and intended for those with a little experience with UNIX.    the source is here.  <answer69994> Here is a proof of concept ffmd_sqlite script that uses the Firefox places database. Webloc docs are created that will be found by Spotlight and can be opened with Firefox.  <comment886> It might be worthwhile to explain just what this script is doing (eg. "Basically it's a shell script that parses your bookmarks.html file and writes it out as .webbookmark files in the Spotlight cache -- which is what Safari does with its bookmarks" ripped from the source) <comment942> What is the wheel group? <comment1353> Unfortunately this script is outdated. Firefox has a [new bookmarks format](http://www.lytebyte.com/2008/06/19/understanding-how-and-where-firefox-3-bookmarks-are-saved/). It actually doesn't look very difficult though. I will have a go a writing a new script if I ever get a chance <comment81361> Hello, and welcome to Ask Different! Please do not simply link to raw scripts without providing context; if the code is yours, do explain what it does (and why it is “proof of concept”), if it is not, please link to a resource explaining it as well as giving a summary. Also, a usage note (how to install and run) would be helpful.
