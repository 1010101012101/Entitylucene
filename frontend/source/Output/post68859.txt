She does tell me I may want to turn it off to stop applications from disturbing me. <comment80002> It works on my 3rd gen iPad... <comment80009> On my iPhone 5 this is what Siri tells me: https://dl.dropbox.com/u/870088/pictures/Photo%202012-10-18%206%2050%2015%20PM.png <comment80010> I concur with Ian, Siri doesn't seem to be able to change the DND setting.

I can't activate DND, although I thought I could
