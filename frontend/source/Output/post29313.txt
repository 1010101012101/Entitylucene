Is kill -15 the same as File -> Quit? <body> I want to quit a process but without force quitting it. Is that possible from the terminal?  <answer29317> codekill/code acts on Unix level, the targeted process is free to ignore any signal besides codekill -9/code. And depending on the internal structure of the process you are looking at, codekill -15/code will not be the same as 'File-Quit'.   As an alternative you could do something like codeosascript -e 'tell application "Safari" to quit'/code.
