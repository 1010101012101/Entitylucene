Using Chrome on macOS without address bar & menu like kiosk mode <body> I just want a browser window without the address bar or any menu, with just one tab.  In Windows, codechrome.exe --app=http://gmail.com/code is used. I want the macOS version for it.  <answer273909> It's basically the same thing in macOS. Provide the path to the Chrome binary and use the flags as normal, such as:  precode/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --app=https://gmail.com /code/pre  <comment344316> Try unchecking View - Always Show Toolbar in Fullscreen and make a Google Chrome window full screen. <comment344356> doing it every single time is tiring. I hope chrome has a basic mode. Like in vlc, where you just have the video with the controls in a separate window. <comment344358> How do I create an alias for this in my .zshrc, so all I have to type is "co google.com"? <comment344366> @user7579349 That's a completely separate question and I encourage you to do some research about that first. You can't use an alias here since alias inserts a space before the argument. You'll have to use a function. <comment344371> thanks @grgarside. What is "--app" called? A parameter? How can I see what other options are there for chrome? <comment344383> @user7579349 Once again, a completely separate question. I don't use Chrome so I don't know.
