Stop menu closing when clicked <body> Im a new OSX user, and coming from Windows if I click a menu item which has a child popout menu I expect it to open the child not close the whole menu.  strikeThis seems to be system wide/strike bThis seems to be within the main menu bar and not context menus/b, is there a setting I can change to stop the click closing the menu?  <answer64348> No, there is no such setting. If it existed, it would most probably be in System Preferences  Appearance.  However, this behavior seems to depend on the application. On my 10.6 system, the Finder and iTunes indeed present it, but iCal, Mail and Safari don't.  I unfortunately have no idea as to the root cause for this difference, and which programs might behave in which way.  <comment75534> What do you call a “child popout menu” exactly? If it's a submenu, clicking it should simply do nothing, not close the menu. <comment75536> Steps to replicate, in `finder` click `go` then click `recent folders` and the menu disappears <comment75537> Oh, interesting. Testing on 10.6: Finder and iTunes indeed present this behavior, but iCal, Mail, Safari don't… <comment75541> Thanks anyway, I will have to learn to not be so hasty with the clicking.
