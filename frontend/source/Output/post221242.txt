Weird sound when doing something forbidden <body> MBP Mid 2012 on OSX 10.10.5  Since a couple of months I recogniz a weird sound on my computer. It appears whenever I do something "forbidden", i.e. using a key in a programm which has no functionality.   You can listen to the sound here. I "made" it through opening Quicktime with a video, stopping the video and repeatedly pushing the button "d" on my keyboard. Any ideas? Is that the "your doing somthing 'forbidden' sound" which I did not recognize before?  <answer221293> You can customize this sound in your System Preferences Sound settings  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GUO8C.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment267896> What is the affected soft ? <comment267901> @MrMojoRisin whenever I do something "forbidden" in any program <comment267969> haha thats supposed to sound like a frog?! thanks!
