Can I get service for my Windows PC iTunes at a Genius Bar? <body> I have a general question to ask.  If I have iTunes running on my Windows PC, and something was wrong, could I bring it into the Apple Store's Genius bar for them to service it?  Do they service Apple software outside of Apple hardware?  <answer93422> Apple retail stores support iTunes on PC. The depth of troubleshooting is typically deleting iTunes and associated applications from PC and re-downloading iTunes. That said many people have received great how-to info regarding iTunes on PC or Mac in Apple retail stores  <answer93764> I went to the Apple store and asked my questions.   They do offer emsome/em service for iTunes on a PC. They just won't go beyond anything iTunes-- example the registry or other driver issues. So if it's very much a PC issue, they don't address those. I would think it would be similar to their web browser Safari.  As for service for Apple software on non-Apple hardware, say Mac OS X on an hackintosh, they will not service.  <comment108687> easy way to find out - call your local Apple Store and ask... <comment108705> ... and after calling your local Apple Store please share it with others answering your own question.
