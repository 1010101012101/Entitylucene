How can I preserve indentation in Notes.app on OS X? <body> Suppose I've got a text formatted like this:  precodeTo do:       To buy:           milk /code/pre  I would like the Notes app to keep the indentation level as I enter a new line:  precodeTo do:       To buy:           milk         sugar /code/pre  How ever it jumps to the beginning of the next line:  precodeTo do:       To buy:           milk sugar /code/pre  Can I do anything about it? (emExcept using lists/bullet points?/em)  <answer225192> One solution is to write all your list items, one under the other, neglecting any indentation level. Then, you can select all the items you want to be on the same level, and press kbdcmd/kbd+kbd]/kbd. This will allow you to increase the indentation level. As far as I know, auto-indentation applies just for bulled/dashed lists.
