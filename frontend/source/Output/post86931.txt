How to show git files in Finder? <body> This may be too close to a duplicate for Git plug-in for Finder?, but I'm after a tool that will merely show me whether there is a repo in the current directory, and the state of the files within.  ul liI don't want to view all invisible files/li liI want to continue using Finder (I like PathFinder, but not always)/li liI don't need to run git commands on the files, just see their state/li /ul  I'm thinking of an interface like Dropbox (see image), or TortoiseSVN for windows... any suggestions or workarounds?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QiixJ.png" alt="Dropbox&#39;s synced indicators in Finder"  Maybe its possible to create a folder automation? (never done such a thing! if it sounds plausible, I'll read up on it)  Thanks, Tim  <answer119251> An update, as there's been movement on this question...  There is a question on SO: How can i add icon overlay in finder? where a comments include Apples update of  points to the TortoiseSVN Subversion client  and a search turned up the following 2yo git repo with some demo code for 10.7: Finder-Icon-Overlay.  If I get around to messing around with an implementation, I'll update this answer.  <comment100539> Dropbox uses https://github.com/rentzsch/mach_inject to inject code into the Finder process to change the overlay. This is TRICKY BUSINESS.  Finder in 10.6 can be hacked with a [SIMBL](https://code.google.com/p/simbl/wiki/Tutorial) plugin , you just have to use the swizzling method to reimplement the drawWithFrame method in the Finder. <comment100649> heh..
