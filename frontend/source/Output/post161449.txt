Hooking into establishing Wi-Fi connection on Yosemite <body> Is there a way to hook into the process of establishing a Wi-Fi connection for executing some arbitrary actions (i.e. scripts or something) on certain events like connection established, connection dropped etc?   I'm basically looking for something like post-connection or pre-connection script or an event which I can reliably subscribe to. That could be either user or system-specific.  <comment188685> Can you share what fore ? <comment188714> For example, for bringing virtual interface up or down on connection to a certain wi-fi network (preferably) or to wifi network as a general case
