MacBookPro - PRAM Reset <body> My MacBook Pro is booting to a Black Screen and the only way I can get the display is via a PRAM Reset.  When I shut it down it just re-boots to a Black Screen again. I have tried an SMC Reset and a Keypress Sequence to Ditch the Black Screen using the S key but they don't work.  I am running Sierra 10.12.2  Can anyone help?  <comment334117> What does helpmlook like to you? Instructions to boot to recovery HD and reinstall the OS? List of what startup keys actually do? <comment334120> What Keypress sequence using the S key are you referring to? What exact model of MBP are you using? And what hardware (if any) do you have connected to it? <comment334123> After the PRAM reset, are you able to boot normally once?
