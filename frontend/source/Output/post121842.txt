Using Oracle Java 7 without the plug-in <body> I need Oracle Java 7 for software running on my Mac, but do not wish to have the plug-in available in my web browsers.  How can I accomplish this configuration and maintain it across Java upgrades?  <answer121879> I'd say just install java as normal. Afterwards go to  System Preferences → Java (bottom row) → Security  and uncheck "Enable Java content in the web browser".   That should do it, and I would very much expect it to remember the setting after an update.
