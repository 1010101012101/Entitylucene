How do configure Skype For Business to not start when macOS starts? <body> Skype For Business 16.2.145 automatically starts and sign's in when my machine starts.  The usual solutions for Skype don't work for Skype for Business. I cannot change this setting in the dock or in the app's preferences.  How do I change this setting?  <answer265593> Check System Preferences - Accounts - Login Items and make sure it's added there.   <comment332714> Have you checked system preferences - accounts - login items? <comment332993> @grgarside This is not a duplicate because I am referring to Skype for Business not Skype and that answer does not work for Skype For Business <comment332994> @RobdeJonge thanks mate. Your answer actually worked. If you set it as the answer I will mark it correct <comment332995> @TheLearner You just said it's not a duplicate, so I've re-opened your question, but now you say the login items solution works, which makes it a duplicate? <comment333053> The answer in the duplicated question does not work. The answer that @RobdeJonge gave does work. If you look at the 2 answers they both different approaches to doing the same thing. Sadly only Rob's answer actually works. What do you want me to say mate? <comment340140> This is correct, but to clarify for macos Sierra - if you don't want Skype for Business to open automatically go to System Preferences  Users & Groups  Current User  Login Items. If Skype for Business is listed, select it, and then click - to remove it.  It won't start anymore. <comment347812> Doesn't seem to work. Skype for Business is not listed there yet is still launches on login. <comment370463> It was listed for me, but not checked. I went ahead and removed it from the list, but that will probably not have any effect on it. <comment370464> So what I did was used terminal. Found it with `launchctl list | grep skype`. Then removed it with `sudo launchctl remove com.skype.skype.shareagent`. <comment370978> Of all the applications that I've installed this year, why is it not surprising that only Skype thinks it's important enough to enjoy a unilateral login startup...
