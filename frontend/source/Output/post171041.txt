Does Apple distribute Yosemite with DHT? <body> When I last installed Yosemite I watched at the logfile and it displayed messages like  precodeThe resource &lt;xxx.dmg&gt; at distance 5 The resource &lt;yyy.dmg&gt; at distance 25 /code/pre  What does this distance mean? I suspect itâ€™s an exponential distance, typical of the Kademlia protocol, the DHT used by BitTorrent.  <comment201224> All DHTs rely on having a 'distance metric' - a way of comparing two NodeIDs or hashes to determine how far apart they are. Kademlia uses the 'XOR metric': The distance between two NodeIDs is the XOR of those two NodeIDs, interpreted as a number.
