Only the 3G is working on iOS 7 <body> I just buy a used iphone 4 on ebay running an iOS 7.0.4 with the Baseband 5.0.02 . I don't know if the iphone is officiel disimlocked but when I put my sim card I have a 3G connection who is working well but I can't recive/call ..Cydia and sam are installed on the iphone but I don't know why ..  <comment144850> Just asking to make sure it's not the SIM card.. have you tried if the SIM-card is able to receive calls in another phone? <comment144853> yes I was using it in another iphone it work fine <comment144855> If possible ask the seller if it is locked (and unlocked via jailbreak), or alternatively I think Apple can tell you wether the phone is locked (call AppleCare or a local Apple Store)  If it is officially unlocked, I'd recommend to restore it via iTunes
