Can you use the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller with an Apple TV? <body> I am wondering if the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller can be used with both the Nintendo Switch (obviously, it can) and my appletv(4th generation).  The specific controller I am referring to is this one:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/70BUZ.jpg" alt="Nintendo Switch Pro Controller (front)"  I have looked online for the answer to my question, and the most information I could find relating to connecting Nintendo Switchâ€™s official wireless controllers to an Apple device were articles such as one from TechCrunch and another from AppleInsider on how to connect the Joy-Con controllers to a desktop or mobile Apple device.  <answer292705> After reading the article you linked to on AppleInsider, I noticed that it says that      They will not work with iOS games, nor tvOS.   Since these controllers are not "Made for tvOS/iOS" certified, they will be unable to be used with your Apple TV. You will instead need to use a controller that emis/em certified, like the Horipad Ultimate that is sold on the Apple Store.   You can find more compatible controllers that are sold on the Apple Store here  <comment369280> Well, that sucks.
