Display color change <body> The display on my MacBook Pro laptop has suddenly changed so that instead of white here I get a light yellow.  What has happened?  <answer117073> I'm not sure how this can happen all of a sudden, but I have a suggestion.br Launch System Preferences (fastest way is Apple Menu  System Preferences)br Click on codeDisplay/codebr Click on the codeColor/code tabbr Select codeColor LCD/code in the left columnbr If this does not reset the color, click the codeCalibrate.../code button on the left. This launches the Display Calibrator Assistantbr At the step called codeTarget White Point/code (see the current step name at the left of the window) make sure you select codeNative/code  Hope this helps  <answer117083> I like Arc676's suggestion, however the yellowing you describe can also result from a loose video connection between the main board and the LCD screen. A search on "macbook pro display connector loose yellow" returns many horror stories, however, sometimes things just need a little jiggle to return to proper function.  <answer142341> Was having the same problem. Display Calibration helps. :D just go to Sytem preferences, Display, Color Tab then Calibrate. :)   <answer255691> I had uneven colors on certain webpages on my Macbook Pro. Somehow it switched the profile (I guess during the upgrade to Sierra) to Apple RGB. Changing it back to "Color LCD" solved my problem too (without calibrating).  <comment171644> Don't like this possibility, huh? Must be a pretty important opinion to supply after waiting 1.5 years to give it. Why not elucidate, rather than just giving the downvote of Doom?
