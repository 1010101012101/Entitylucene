How do I make the Globe key disappear from the keyboard? <body> I do some dev and testing on the iPhone. Recently, I was testing some localizations and needed to change the language. I've since changed back to English, but now whenever I bring up a keyboard a "globe" key is always near the bottom of the keyboard. This annoys the heck out of me because I keep accidentally tapping it. Any way to turn it off?   <answer3751> Under Settings  General  Keyboard  International Keyboards you've got a list of all the keyboard layouts available.br To remove the "Globe" key, you need to have only one keyboard enabled.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TZrf3.png" width="213" height="320" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vZfgO.png" width="213" height="320" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KfKmd.png" width="213" height="320"  <comment3553> Wow, you took a long time to take those screenshots ;) <comment3554> @gareth yeah, I wasn't really satisfied with the first 1569 screenshots :)
