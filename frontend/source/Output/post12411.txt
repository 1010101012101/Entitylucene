Buying a Mac for a Boys Soccer Team <body> My friend wants to buy a Mac. He is the coach for a Highschool Boys Soccer Team and wants to use it for video editing and media keeping.  I assume that a low-end Macbook is going to be too slow for what he wants, but I'm no expert. What specs (Memory, RAM, etc) matter?   A recommendation would also be awesome.  <answer12414> A low-end MacBook will work great for all of that, unless he's used to editing on a pro setup (then he'll want more speed and a bigger screen). You'd be surprised how fast even slow laptops are these days.   And always, always max out the RAM. Do it at Apple when you buy the machine to do it the easy way, or buy the RAM later and do it yourself to save a few bucks.  <comment12952> And yeah, just read the FAQ stating that it is not for buying recommendations, but I'm more interested in what specs and hardware I should be looking for. <comment12959> Why not edit the question to improve things a bit? Ask at what point did people outgrow a basic macbook for video editing purposes. Maybe specify what sort of video you are taking? I'll assume it's iPhone 4 quality or less (which is actually quite amazing). If you are not shooting HD with expensive lenses, my feeling is that nothing from the past 2 years Apple sold is "too slow" Getting answers about people outgrowning the basic kit and software will be useful to others and indirectly get you info for your recommendation.
