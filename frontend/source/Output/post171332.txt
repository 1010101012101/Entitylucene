Permanently enabling volume control for audio interface that doesn't support it <body> I use an audio interface (namely a Roland Edirol UA-5, but that doesn't matter) which does not support volume control. I can only control the volume with the physical volume dial on the audio interface.  Now, by combining two freewares from RogueAmoeba, Soundflower and LineIn, I am able to enable volume control on any audio interface by:  ol liSelecting Soundflower as my primary audio interface/li liRouting Soundflower to my Edirol UA-5 with LineIn/li /ol  Thus enabling my native volume to control my audio interface.  This is my question now: is there a native modification I could make to OSX (a flag somewhere, a special kext) that could make this process easier?
