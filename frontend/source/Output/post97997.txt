Find out the seconds where the video is splitted in iMovie11 <body> I have imported a video in iMovie 11, selected some interesting parts, right click, split clip, and so splitted a part of the clip in a smaller one.  Now I'd like to know where it starts and where it begins in the bigger video, like, in minutes/seconds.  Like, I split 3 small parts and I'd like to know, given those parts, for example, that:  ul lithe 1° begins at 1:03 (1 minutes, 3 seconds) and it ends at 1:25 (it is 22 seconds long)/li lithe 2° begins at 2:42 and it ends at 3:5 (it is 23 seconds long)/li lietc../li /ul  Is it possible? how?  <comment115007> Do you mean to reinsert your splits in to original movie where they came from? <comment115008> not properly reinstert but just find out the times.. <comment115009> Find the original times from original movie in clip. <comment115020> sorry but i'm new with imovie 11, how can i do it?
