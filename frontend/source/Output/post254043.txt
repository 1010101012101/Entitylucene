Disk is bootable in MacBook Pro but not iMac <body> I bought an external USB drive, formatted it as OS X Extended (Journaled), and then ran the command as per this web page: http://www.macrumors.com/how-to/macos-sierra-clean-install/  I then used it to install a clean copy of macOS Sierra on my MacBook Pro.  I’ve gone to do the same process on my iMac (I think it’s a mid-2014 model, but it’s not that old) but the USB disk isn’t being detected as bootable. It says as such when running ‘Get Info’ on the disk image in Disk Utility, but it says it emis/em bootable on my MacBook Pro.  So why would the same disk be detected as bootable on one Mac but not the other?
