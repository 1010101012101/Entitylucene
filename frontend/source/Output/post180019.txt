How to set "Go to address" to open the address in a new tab in safari <body> I am a new Safari user, and I want the browser to open a new tab instead of the current tab when I select an address and click "Go to address", just like in Chrome. Can I achieve this without plugin?  <answer180020> You can use added hot-keys to make a whole set of different actions happen when you click a link.    This is the way I have mine set in Safari Preferences…  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Hg21z.png" alt="enter image description here"  This way, a simple click will open the link in the current page,br kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd/click will open it in a new Tab but not activate it &amp;br kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd Shift ⇧ /kbd/click will open it in a new Tab &amp; also bring it to the front.  Setting the first dropmenu to 'Always' will also set a new Tab to be opened if you select the URL in another application &amp; right-click select 'Open URL'  <comment213633> Sorry, actually there is  a `Go to address in new Tab` entry in the context menu, and I just ignored it. What a stupid question. <comment213634> My question is about plain text address, not the one in `` tag. Anyway, I found out that there is an entry just next to the `Go to address`. I made a stupid mistake. <comment221084> I edited `your` question. `Safari`, `Chrome` and buttons ARE NOT CODE. Superfluous `code` makes `your` post `hard` to read
