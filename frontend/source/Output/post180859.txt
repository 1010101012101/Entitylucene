iOS data usage specifics - iTunes Accounts <body> I'm trying to find out what does "iTunes Accounts" traffic stands for on iOS, since it has gobbled 850MB on cellular data in 13 days. I have iTunes Match on but have disabled the Music app to access data on cellular networks. I'm on iOS 8.3 since today, data was consumed on 8.2.  <answer180883> Probably iTunes &amp; App Store background downloads.  You can prevent these, so it only updates when you're connected to wifi, inbr Settings  iTunes &amp; App Storeâ€¦  by disabling Cellular Databr [I also prevent all automatic downloads, so mine only updates from iTunes itself, on my Mac]  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6NuEQ.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer254900> Wow, my phone (iOS 10 now) shows this as 129MB in the last month since reset, with strongall the above turned off/strong  I don't even play Music on my phone, only listen to Podcasts (which has a separate total of 74MB).  Seriously confused!  Sorry I don't have an answer but thought this might be a useful data point confirming that a significant amount can be run up strongwithout/strong the data being enabled tor emiTunes &amp; App Store/em  <answer271845> Seems like it might be iCloud documents syncing Settings - iCloud - iCloud Drive (scroll to the bottom to turn off cellular data).   Also seems like iTunes music "new music mix" might come in under this.   <comment214977> Thanks! I'll check that and report on usage on a few days. <comment214978> I had "Use Cellular Data" on, all the rest deactivated. <comment215571> Cellular data off and the drainage stopped. Thanks for your help.
