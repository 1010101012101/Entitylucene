Why can't I use iMessages using cellular data any more on my iPhone? <body> Why can't I use iMessages using cellular data any more on my iPhone? I can use it with wifi, but when I turn on cellular, the message keeps popping out that my cellular data needs to be turned on (which it is!), or wifi in order for iMessages to work.  <comment361643> Have you checked your cellular settings in Settings  Cellular to allow Messages to use cellular data? <comment361655> Messages are not listed there for me.
