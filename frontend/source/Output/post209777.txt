How can I tell whom a text message is addressed to? <body> I have my iPhone 5S set up so I may receive text messages sent to my email account, my phone number AND my son's phone number. The problem is, when I get a message (say, one that was sent to my son's number) I can't tell if it was sent to ME or HIM.   How can I see this info?  <answer209784> I'd guess you probably can't.   The entire Apple/iCloud paradigm is to be able to get messages to strongyou/strong across multiple devices simultaneously.br To make it easy for strongyou/strong to deal with those messages wherever you may be.   The last thought of the manufacturers/programmers was to differentiate message recipients inside one device containing multiple strongyou/strongs.  <comment253057> That's a bummer
