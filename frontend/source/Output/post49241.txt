Why is the Network Link Conditioner preference pane crashing as soon as I turn it on? <body> I am trying to use the Network Link Conditioner preference pane included with the Hardware IO tools in the developer tools to throttle Internet speeds. I can open and load the preference pane, but as soon as I try to turn it on, System Preferences crashes. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yIits.png" alt=""br Why is this happening and how can I fix it? I have a 13" MacBook Pro with a 2.3 GHz Intel Core i5 running OS 10.7.3.br Here's the log entry for the NLC crash:  precode5/10/12 9:31:39.150 AM [0x0-0x1c51c5].com.apple.systempreferences: NLCd : Bootstrap failure /code/pre  <answer51551> Just a quick note to say that I eventually stopped the crashing by manually copying these two files from another OS X machine and then manually starting the nlcd daemon (if you don't have another Mac, I posted my copies of those files here)  Copied these files:br code/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.NetworkLinkConditioner.plist/codebr code/usr/libexec/nlcd/codebr Run these three commands:    precodesudo chown root /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.NetworkLinkConditioner.plist       sudo chmod 644 /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.NetworkLinkConditioner.plist    sudo launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.NetworkLinkConditioner.plist /code/pre  After that the pref pane didn't unexpectedly exit when moving the switch to 'on'.  Taken from https://devforums.apple.com/message/645980#645980  <answer63430> I filed a bug report (#11891721) for this. I linked to odyth's answer in the report and this is their response.     Changing the nlcd file over to an older version makes it compatible   with the preference pane, (as you did in this case). The current   version of the prefpane works with the latest nlcd.  We can not do   anything about the older installs of nlcd or the prefpane that you   have.      We are closing this bug since we are aware of the issue.      Please be sure to regularly check the seed notes and release notes for   any updates that might affect this issue. Â Again, thank you for taking   the time to submit bugs.  We sincerely appreciate your input.   So there's the official answer.  <answer164021> I had the same issue in Yosemite.  Tried with the files mentioned here, but it was still crashing.  Giving admin rights to my OS X user seemed to "solve" the issue. In other words, strongrunning the app as a "Standard" user seems to cause the crash/strong for me.  Still it is not a nice solution, but maybe it helps some people or give insight for a better solution. :)  <comment56596> I have exactly the same symptoms as you :( <comment58287> Could be lots of reasons.  Did you use `Console` to check the logs?  Meanwhile, since Network Link Conditioner is just a front end for `ipfw` you can [use ipfw directly](http://titaniumninja.com/simulating-slow-network-links-on-os-x/). <comment58318> @OldPro I've updated my question to include the Console log information. <comment58321> You've downloaded the latest Xcode from the MAS? <comment58322> @da4 Yes I have. <comment58323> Have you tried Getting Info on System Preferences and setting it to open in 32-bit mode, then trying to access this prefpane? <comment58324> @da4 It still crashes. <comment58925> Any update on this I too am having the same problem? <comment58929> @odyth No update...I'm still having the problem too... <comment58931> I just solved it see my response below <comment64576> So sorry I didn't see this!! I did try this and it seems to work. However, I need to try it out on a faster network. Give me a few days to test it out. Thanks! <comment65052> Seems to work and the bandwidth is being limited, so I accepted your answer. Thanks so much! Now I just wish Apple would get their act together and fix this. Off to submit some Apple feedback! <comment83334> Is it possible to share those files on a different server? It seems like we have to signup and the language cannot be set to english... <comment105093> Can you please upload it on another place? I can't download it anymore ... <comment129620> Indeed... that website malware heaven. <comment130285> The files I uploaded still work just fine, but I uploaded it to my dropbox https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/7698018/networkLinkConditionerFiles.zip. <comment130286> Also as of iOS 6 Network Link Conditioner is built into the phone itself, which I have found to be more useful then using the version on my computer.  Settings  Developer  Network Link Conditioner. <comment135091> In other words, i was having the same problem on OS X Lion using the Hardware IO Tools from February 2012. After reading this answer i tried the Hardware IO Tools from Late July 2012 (which is announced for OS X Mountain Lion) and it worked fine. <comment349573> this is still true for macOS Sierra 10.12.3
