How to transfer music onto iTunes? <body> I just got a new MacBook Air and I am trying to transfer my music that I did not buy from iTunes from my old computer onto my new MacBook. I saved my music onto a USB drive but the music won't transfer into my iTunes on my new computer. Please Help!  <answer98062> Within iTunes, select on the "Add to Library" option:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Q7hsX.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Then select on the folder containing your music. It may take some time to import, but your music should then be accessible within iTunes.
