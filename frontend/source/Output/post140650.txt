Remote desktop drawing problems <body> I'm trying to connect into one of our Mac build servers (running OS X 10.8.5). However every time I connect the VNC connection gets into a bad state where the mouse cursor seems to corrupt the display.  I've tried connecting from Mac OS X 10.8 and from Windows via TightVNC and both have the same problem.  Is there any way to fix this problem?  br/  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bfTYi.jpg" alt="example of the corrupt display"
