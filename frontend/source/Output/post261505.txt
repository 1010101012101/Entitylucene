Macvim can not load custom Powerline fonts when started from tmux session <body> I have a really strange issue with MacVim + Tmux + Powerline Fonts.  ol liI can run MacVim from the dock or terminal and it correctly starts with Powerline fonts. /li liWhen I start a tmux session, and launch macvim from tmux, strongany custom Font will not load./strong If I open the graphical font browser, the font is listed and selected, it just does not modify the font in the UI. If I select another system font, the UI font will change!!/li /ol  I've tried copying the shell environments between tmux and the standard terminal, but it does not have any affect.  strongDoes anyone know how tmux could be breaking my fonts in macvim session?/strong  I'm seeing this issue in Sierra and the exact same config works in El Capitan.  <answer261511> I stumbled over the solution with some searching. The issue issue can be fixed with the codereattach-to-user-namespace/code tool.  precode$ brew install reattach-to-user-namespace /code/pre  Add the following line to the end of your code~/.tmux.conf/code file  precodeset-option -g default-command "reattach-to-user-namespace -l zsh" /code/pre  <comment366701> Did you solved this one? I have same problem. <comment366862> Yeah, see the answer I posted. <comment366863> I tried that package (reattach-to-user-namespace) but still I have same problem. My MacVim don't see powerline fonts and some other stuff. The problem is probably related to env variables but I am not sure how to solve it. Have you tried anything else?
