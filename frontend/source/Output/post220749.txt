How do I set up the Programmer Dvorak key layout on Mac OSX El Capitan? <body> I looked up the instructions for Dvorak on https://support.apple.com/kb/PH21495, but they do not seem to apply to my case, as they only list a way to emselect/em the Dvorak layout, and not a way to eminstall/em and emselect/em the Programmer Dvorak layout.   I also followed the variations of the instructions related to Mac OSX Mavericks at the following link, to no avail:   http://www.kaufmann.no/roland/dvorak/macosx.html  After installing the layout driver package and following the instructions for "Adding Programmer Dvorak to the list of available layouts", even after a restart of the OS, and clearing of the layout cache by codesudo rm -f /System/Library/Caches/com.apple.IntlDataCache.le*/code no Programmer Dvorak layout appeared.   I installed Mr. Kaufmann's package successfully, but it did not seem to change any of the listed keyboards.   Neither a search for "Dvorak" nor a search for "Programmer" gave me any good results for the Programmer Dvorak keyboard layout.   I can put screenshots, here, too, but I do not want to make this question too specific to my particular setup, as this is a general interest question and answer site.   I welcome specific answers as well as the usual steps for troubleshooting Programmer Dvorak Keyboard Layout installation on El Capitan.

I just installed a keyboard for the International Phonetic Alphabet and had the same problem. Good luck!  <comment267227> What about the article isn't applying in your case? What avail were you able to get in the supporting link. If someone wanted to help you , they would have to guess at what your specific issue it with the instructions you listed. <comment267237> It is just impossible to help with so little info.  What exactly did not work when you tried to install the kaufmann.no package?  Did it never appear in system prefs/keyboard/input sources or in the "flag" menu at the top right of the screen?  Did it appear there but not type correctly, and if so, what exactly did not work right and what apps did you test it with.  Etc. <comment267449> // , I'm not looking for troubleshooting for my specific setup. At this point, I am just looking for installation instructions for Programmer Dvorak Keyboard Layout on El Capitan. I would welcome more specific answers, though. Perhaps I can add some screenshots. <comment269798> // , Perhaps you did not get a chance to read the article, @brmike, but it does not have any information about how to install the Programmer Dvorak Keyboard Layout on OS X El Capitan. <comment269800> // , Your results may vary, but I tested this on the latest (at least, as of 20151008) 15" Retina Macbook Pro with OSX El Capitan installed, using a keyboard layout driver package and set of installation instructions, which I had to modify, from the following location: http://www.kaufmann.no/roland/dvorak/macosx.html. <comment321100> Step 10 was *so* helpful. Had a bunch of apps switching the layout back to US for no apparent reason... Made DVORAK barely usable <comment321196> // , @bmike what are you _really_ asking of me, here? I'm trying to make this a general interest question, not free tech support. Sometimes that makes me err on the side of "vague" in the name of "general", but the goal is something that applies to _everyone_, not just my specific use case. Asking for a specific use case stunts the whole point of the stackexchange.com format, I think, since these are supposed to get general interest answers. <comment321199> // , I'm curious, with which version of Mac OSX did this succeed?
