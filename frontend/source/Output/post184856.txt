Order of the VPN connections in the VPN menu <body> Is it possible to change the order of the VPN connection in the OS X VPN Menu?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Aaslb.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer184883> Rename them ;).  They are ordered alphabetically.  If you put a white space (edit: or any other name that precedes in the alphanumeric order) in front of the second VPN's name in System Preferences  Network (by selecting the VPN Service and clicking on the cog symbol below the services: click "Rename Service..."), then un-tick and re-tick "Show VPN status in menu bar", the order will change.  <comment219256> and you could not just simply drag it to the top position ?
