How do I copy photos from an iMessage chat to the iOS Camera Roll? <body> When I long press on a photo someone shared with me in an iMessage chat I get three main options: Copy, More..., and Speak. More only presents options to delete all, or select some messages to forward to someone. Speak doesn't seem useful.
