Is it possible to send/receive faxes directly on the iPhone? <body> Is it possible to send and receive faxes directly on the iPhone?    The goal is to try to avoid paying an additional 5 or 10 bux a month to use a 3rd party service.  I'm hoping the functionality can be either bought through an app or configured.    <answer2021> Looks like you're looking for the iFax app (Unfortunatlly I don't have a link here at work, but if you search for it in the store it should pop up), however I've got the next best thing!  http://www.macnn.com/articles/09/07/20/ifax.iphone.app.released/  <answer80359> Easy to use.  Take a picture and send.  http://www.boomfax.com  <answer122534> It is possible to send and receive faxes straight from your iPhone, Popfax- http://www.popfax.com has developed a fully featured mobile fax website, which turns mobile devices into miniature fax machines. It is easy, quick, and it works on the go.  <comment1729> Can't you just use email instead? Same thing as fax, just without the need for analog. <comment92741> @Webs there are some e.g financial/legal transactions that need a fax. Although if one end is email is it still valid ?
