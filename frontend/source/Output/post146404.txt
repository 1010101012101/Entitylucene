I downloaded malware called extended icons from skype - removal? <body> I got this as a skype message:   "Your skype does not support extended icons. Please download the extension here: " (skypemoticonscomplete dot com)  And then went to the url and downloaded/installed...which I immediately regretted as it became quite clear this is a malware/trojan/virus.  So far it has:  ul liadded this icon to my firefox:/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/50biV.png" alt="enter image description here"  ul liIt also has opened 2 drives under the devices section in finder:  ul liskypEmoticons/li limaccaptain/li /ul/li /ul  I found windows removal advice for windows, but not for mac.  But, nothing for mac - was hoping somebody had a solution :)  <answer146578> Dang. Sorry to hear about the hassle.  You may get some mileage out of ClamXav from the malware/antivirus side:  http://www.clamxav.com/  Additionally, you may want to run AdwareMedic to search out and remove any adware that may additionally have been deposited:  http://www.adwaremedic.com/index.php
