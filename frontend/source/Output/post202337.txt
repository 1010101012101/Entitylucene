Edit Table of Contents in Preview? <body> In Preview, is there a way to change/edit the names of links in the Table of Contents of a pdf?    <answer202553> Preview does not support this.  You need more advanced PDF editing software, like Adobe Acrobat Pro or PDF Outliner.  <answer202555> You could use a combination of tools to remove the old ToC, and attach a new one:  ul liuse PDF SAM ("strongs/strongplit stronga/strongnd strongm/strongerge"; it's FOSS and cross-platform) to take off the old ToC;/li liuse PDF Outliner ($4.99 in Mac App store) to generate a new one./li /ul  subSee other helpful tools in another Q&amp;A./sub  <answer229498> Preview can't modify or add TOC, but I find an alternative way to do this is use bookmark.  Just navigate to the page and press CMD+D, or choose "Tools/Add Bookmark" menu item, the page number and some text from the begin of the page will show on the bookmark view.  I use this way to add link to the PDF file without TOC, and it works.  <answer242891> Well, as has stated by others, preview cannot edit toc.  I tried PDF SAM. To be honest, I think it's a bit user-unfriendly.  Give it a try on Foxit Reader, free and elegant as on Windows platform, as shown below.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y6IrU.png" alt="Foxit Reader TOC Edit Sample"
