Has anyone figured out how to identify the unique page of each separate Safari Web Content process with Safari 7/Mavericks? <body> I know I'm not the first one to wonder this.  Something like the Chrome Task Manager.  In short, when you have multiple tabs/pages open in the new Safari 7 (shipped with Mavericks), each one is launched as a separate system process. You can view the list of processes in Activity Monitor, but you cannot see the underlying page or URL of each process.  This would be very helpful for troubleshooting a runaway or hanging page that's sucking up RAM or CPU cycles.  Apple removed the Activity window in Safari 6. And now with Safari 7, the separate processes are great, but more granular info about each tab would be really great.  Anyone?  <answer106895> This is not an ideal solution but a quite good working workaround.   delOpen Safari then go to Preferences.  Activate the Debug option (Show develop menu in menu bar)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/M6nu6.png" alt="Safari Preference Pane" /del strongEDIT:/strong Instead of activating the develop menu, you have to open a terminal and activate the debug menu with codedefaults write com.apple.Safari IncludeInternalDebugMenu -bool true/code  Thanks @Collin C.  You will find the option codeShow Web Process IDs in Page Titles/code under Debug  Miscellaneous Flags  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/raFlG.png" alt="Show Web Process IDs"  If you open the Activity Monitor now, you can see the Web Process IDs to the corresponding websites.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FxbG8.png" alt="Web Process ID and Activity Monitor"  I hope this is helping you.  <answer106926> If you hover you mouse over the name of the Process a Tooltip will show up telling you the URL Base domain  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HJXrO.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer189632> This is an update on the topic of seeing which Safari URLs are associated with which PIDs in Activity Monitor. I am using Safari 8.0.6 on Yosemite 10.10.3 with Debug menu on and showing PIDs in the page titles (see above and below for how to do this).  Nicolas B stated that "we still miss the opposite way: Process  Tabs" referring to looking for a list of tab names based on the single line-item PID in Activity Monitor. I can show you how to see all of the tabs associated with a particular web process (PID), although it may not completely bring satisfaction, since (1) it is a multi-step process, and (2) trying to find the logic in PID assignments based on tabs is akin to reading tea leaves it seems. It should also be remembered that listing all page URLs associated with any single web process within Activity Monitor is not practicable in the UI as it exists today. (I wish Safari's programmers at Apple would add it into the info window for web processes, however!)  At first, I assumed the name shown on the process line-item referred to the last full page opened by that PID (not including cached pages), but alas this does not appear to be the case. I am not sure how the line-item actually gets its name. I will share the results of my experiment to find the answer following my explanation of how to see what tabs are associated with each line-item in Activity Monitor.  ol liturn on the debug menu in Safari/li liselect the option to show Web Process IDs in Page Titles, as explained above/li ligo and get this excellent Safari plugin from Brett Terpstra, TabLinks. (please donate to him if you find the plugin useful!)/li lirun the plugin by pressing on the small link icon to the left of the URL "Address and Search" field at the top of Safari's window/li liadd a separator character into the template used to display the results (for future find and replace work). I inserted a ying-yang character, and thus used "[%w-%n]:☯%u☯%t" as my template. This will give you the results including the [WP PID] information at the end of each tab name from Safari’s debugging info./li licopy the results into memory and jump to any text app to do a find/replace on the ying-yang character to make them tabs (I used Nisus Writer Pro, my fav!); you will also have to find all occurrences of " [WP " and do a replace adding a tab character in place of the single space leading, as "emtab/em[WP ". This will allow you to split the PIDs into a separate column in a spreadsheet. Save this file as a .tab plain text file./li liopen the tab file in a spreadsheet app (I used Numbers) and have fun sorting by PID. Now there's only one more step.../li liin Activity Monitor, view "All Processes, Hierarchically" and copy/paste the list of line-items showing URLs into your spreadsheet app alongside the tab names and numbers you have already in there. You can discard all of the column data you don't need and just keep the URLs and PIDs in two columns, or add the Memory column to compare RAM usage too./li /ol  That's it; not exactly quick, but not terribly complicated. There's probably a faster way, but this was my first try to get this info.  After doing this, you may find results similar to mine. I had 9 windows open with a total of 36 tabs, all being contained in 20 "url-style" processes. (I am not here including the QTKitServer / Safari Web Content processes which also run alongside most, if not all, of the "url processes"; these QTKitServer processes have a tiny RAM footprint in comparison to the main "url processes", eg., 4.5 MB vs 300 MB for the main process).  My observations are as follows:  ul liRAM use was total of 5.4 GB for 36 tabs in 20 processes, average of 258 MB per process; private memory was 2.0 GB total with 97 MB the average for each process/li liany single process line-item may contain one or more tabs (mine usually had one or two tabs per PID)/li lithe url name of the line-item does not seem to follow any pattern I can discern, except that the name usually (but NOT ALWAYS) reflects the base url of one of the tabs assigned to that PID/li lisometimes, the url name is not accurate: 4 of my 20 used a url which was NOT open in any of my tabs. (Could these be cached pages, perhaps?)/li lia new tab (or window) may be assigned to either an existing PID or to a new process, seemingly in a “random" fashion; they are neither sequential nor grouped with any particular window; thus any window with multiple tabs can have several PIDs running alongside each other/li /ul  This is enough for now! I hope someone a lot smarter than I can come along and explain a little more! aloha.  <comment125452> Rather than enabled the developer menu in preferences you have to enable the debug menu via the command line with "defaults write com.apple.Safari IncludeInternalDebugMenu -bool true" <comment125471> But it is not possible to see the full URL is it? So if I have for example two tabs open, both google.com and each tab has another search request then I won't be able to distinguish between those aren't I? But if nothing more is needed, that this is quite ingenious and much more simple ;D <comment125474> That is correct :-) <comment130352> Wonderful, guys. Thanks! Just randomly discovered the mouseover trick on my own and was coming back here to post the find when I saw your responses. I never received any follow-up notifications from stackechange. <comment157804> Nice tip. But we still miss the opposite way : Process → Tabs. <comment157805> Yep, the Activity window going away is a great loss. But the Activity window far from perfect. In Yosemite's Safari, Apple has taken the issue into account. We will see how.
