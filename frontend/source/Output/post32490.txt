Cannot find where php5-fpm is stored in MacPorts <body> I installed php5 from macports. But i can't find php-fpm for start. Look in /opt/local/sbin and /usr/sbin/  I used console command:  sudo port install php5   May be need some like php5 +fastcgi fscgi  <answer32493> FPM support is still in the works at this writing; see Trac ticket #26039.  <comment99132> And now it looks like FPM support has been added since then. :-)
