How to change preference pane unlock dialog language? <body> During the Mountain Lion installation I have selected the English language as the system language. However, the dialog asking for my password – that appears when you need to install an application, or when you want to unlock a preference pane – is in Dutch. I'm currently in The Netherlands, but I don't see how this might be related to the language of one type of dialog.   Here below an image of the dialog. As you can see there's even a mix of Dutch and English: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RBs9r.png" alt="enter image description here"  I haven't been to other countries yet with this MacBook Pro, so don't know if it's actually dependent on location.  How can I fix this issue?  <answer80484> I've encountered the same in Netherlands. I just switch the language once OSX  installation is complete (and before I run Migration Assistant).  <answer80557> A few things you could try:  ul liRun codesudo languagesetup/code, select a new language, and restart./li liRun codesudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist AppleLocale en_US/code and restart./li liRun codesudo /System/Library/CoreServices/Setup\ Assistant.app/Contents/MacOS/Setup\ Assistant/code, go through the steps of creating a new account, restart, and delete the account./li /ul  <answer80819> In the end I solved the problem by removing all languages except English from the list found in codeSystem Preferences -&gt; Language &amp; Text/code and restarted.  <comment92891> Do you mean that you switch the language in the language and text pref panel? I have English as the first, and Dutch as the second. Removed Dutch from the list, but the problem persists. I have already used migration assistant to migrate from a SL install. I only migrated the User folder, not the settings. <comment92922> Yes, that's what I mean. I let the OSX install complete until I see the desktop, then I change the language setting in International preference pane and reboot. <comment92930> I did this, but it didn't solve the problem. <comment92933> Everything still in Dutch despite language set to English? Even after reboot? <comment92934> Try unselecting all languages (OSX selects some by default) except English, then cold boot. <comment92938> No, not *everything* is in Dutch. That's why I'm surprised. Only the password dialog of some applications is partially in Dutch. And I cannot unselect all languages in the system prefs, the last one I want to unselect always stays. <comment92939> Ah, are these apps not from Apple? <comment92940> let us [continue this discussion in chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/7332/discussion-between-bart-arondson-and-global-nomad)
