Mysterious box floats on second display and won't go away <body> I don't know where this comes from. I can't click it, it is only present on the second display; when I mirror displays it goes away. Does anyone have an idea what this could be?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/J8hzM.jpg" alt="enter image description here" I realise a reboot/logout will probably fix it, but I'm curious as to what this is and whether there is some method which will tell me, to which process it belongs.  System: 10.10.5, Mbp 9,2  strongEdit/strong: Turns out it was Finder. When logging out, I got a popup saying that emsome operations are still in progress/em, although I don't know what.  <comment301277> Can You show us the screenshot? Also try to use Accessibility Inspector: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/232416/how-to-identify-process-from-a-toolbar-icon <comment301278> @MateuszSzlosek Whoops, totally forgot.
