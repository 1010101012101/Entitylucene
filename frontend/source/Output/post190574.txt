How do I change one font to another in Safari? <body> Lets say I have a website with Trebuchet MS. How do I change all instances of that font into something more appealing, like Lucida Grande?  <comment226290> I think you need a custom style sheet, there is some info at  https://developer.apple.com/library/safari/documentation/Tools/Conceptual/SafariExtensionGuide/AddingStyles/AddingStyles.html <comment226497> You are developing something with Safari Extensions or just want to view it in the browser ?
