Where can I find the hardware information on disk [MAC]? <body> I have an image of my macbook from a couple of years back. I'm going through a tough case with Apple, trying to prove that I never placed an 'unauthorised part' (logic board).   If I can find hardware info, even if it's just the CPU type, in some system file, then that will be perfect. Is this even possible/stored somewhere?  I've scoured the web and some logs and/or potentially obvious looking system files in the image. There surely must be a remnant of such info, unless it's generated on the fly in System Report?  <comment370452> Can you please edit your question to detail what sort of disk image you have and how it was created? It'd also be good to know the exact model details of your Mac and what version of macOS was installed when you created the disk image. Finally, if possible, can you clarify what it is you're actually trying to disprove? Are you saying that you have a MacBook that Apple believes you have replaced the logic board in? If so, on what basis is Apple making this claim (e.g. is it that the installed logic board has no serial number, or it something else Apple is using as evidence)?
