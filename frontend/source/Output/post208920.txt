logitech unifying software mac not detecting <body> I am using logitech wireless keyboard K270 and Mouse M185 with my MACbook Air(currently OSX 10.10.5) for more than a year now. All of a sudden today after some time, my keyboard and mouse stopped working. I checked the batteries all seems to be OK. I connected the unifying receiver again after restart with Logitech Unifying software and got this message.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iBJKs.png" alt="enter image description here"  Has anyone faced this problem before, do I need to reinstall the Logitech unifying software again? I also can't even get this software download anywhere on net, the ones which are their are of windows. Not sure what to do :-(  Update: In the System reports I can see the following entries img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dWZHx.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment251948> Kinda sounds like the USB receiver died :( - check that the OS can see it from ï£¿  About this Mac  System Report  USB <comment251961> What am I expected to see there? I have added the snapshot in the updated question. <comment252017> alt/click the reveal triangles to show the connected devices - one of them should be your Unifying Key <comment252039> Can't see any unifying key thr, I have update the snapshot. <comment252040> Yup, could be the thing has died. Double-check the USB socket itself with any other device & make sure it appears in that list [might need to close/open the window again to refresh
