Unresponsive keyboard, trackpad, and wi-fi during ANY kind of startup <body> So a few weeks (2 or 3) before, my MacBook Pro MF839 (13" early 2015) got a problem (OS X - macOS Sierra). At first, I thought it was just a one time problem, but it's been 3 weeks and I've been trying many solutions which still not worked for me.   So here is my problem in short:  Every time I boot up and pressed the alt key (boot loader), my keyboard, trackpad, wi-fi, is having a heavy lagging. While my wireless usb Logitech mouse is working fine.  Some interesting points are:  ol liEven when I didn't go into the bootloader, it still takes longer than normal (30-60 seconds)./li liKeyboard, trackpad, and wifi lags not only on bootloader, but when I tried to reinstall via internet recovery, it also lags/unresponsive./li liWhenever any external hard drive connected while it boots, even when it's flash drive, or external hard disk for time machine backups, it boots even slower. (2-3 minutes)./li liI have Windows 10 installed on my Mac using bootcamp./li liI've using first aid on my APPLE SSD (not Macintosh hd), it said it gives me corrupt partition scheme ( I think ), and need to be first aided in recovery mode, but when I go into recovery mode, it still gives me the same reaction./li liThere is only ONE person who I think have the same prob with me (OSX Startup Manager (Boot drive selection screen) slow/un-responsive in Macbook Pro (early 2015)), contacted him, he still haves the problem./li liI've used MiniTool partition quite few times using Windows, but the problem appeared after I've used it for long. (the problem suddenly happens)./li liThe problem happens even before I upgraded from El Capitan to Sierra. It boots normally sometimes, when I partitioned my windows volume with miniTool./li liThe after boot performance is fine, I even used my Mac currently to type this./li liSometime ago, when I partitioned my drive using Windows and MiniTool, it will boot to windows normally. It happens twice, and both cases are the same./li /ol  I will add more if I notice more things worth mentioning.  Things I've done:   ul liCleaning NVRam /li liFirst aid, duh. /li liDeleting Windows completely. /li liCLEAN reinstall macOS Sierra, and repartition the main SSD. /li liI will add more when I remembers./li /ul  Please let me know if there's something that still unclear there. I don't know what to do anymore, maybe I'll try apple service, but my works will be delayed and I'm so fkd. I'm confused and really sad right now because even after clean reinstall of macOS Sierra using USB, my problem still persists. Please help me.  <comment323509> Have you tried resetting the SMC? <comment323530> @Monomeeth So I have tried SMC reset just now, but apparently, pressing the Shift Ctrl Option and power button at the same time didn't give me any feedback on my magsafe indicator. But it doesn't boot when I pressed the keys, so I think I've resetted it. But the problem's still here. <comment327219> I'm having a similar issue. I've had my 2015 13" macbook pro absolutely screw me several times over the last week, having no response from the inbuilt input devices. I can't even trigger safe mode etc without an external keyboard plugged in. After a few minutes on the login screen it shows a dialogue saying no keyboard has been detected, and to plug in my bluetooth keyboard (*which I neither own, nor have ever used on this machine). So far I haven't found a fix, having tried the same options as you have.
