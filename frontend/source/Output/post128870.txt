Unable to mount Time Machine partition <body> I have a WD external HDD which is plugged into my MacBook Air more or less all the time; it has two partitions one of which is my Time Machine disk. Just today I noticed that the hard drive is not mounting correctly anymore  ul liOn boot-up, both partitions do not show up in the Finder at all/li liWhen I unplug the drive and replug it back in, only the non-Time Machine partition shows up in Finder. It appears to work like normal i.e. reading and writing (I've already copied all my data off it)/li liI can't seem to either eject the disk or unmount the partition that is mountable. If I hit the eject button in Finder, the partition name greys out and is not clickable but does not go away./li /ul  Via Disk Utility, I am unable to either mount the Time Machine partition (I get the generic not able to mount partition error message) and I am also unable to run Repair disk on it (error message: Disk Utility can’t repair this disk. Back up as many of your files as possible, reformat the disk, and restore your backed-up files.). Screenshot below. I tried erasing the disk but that also did not work (error message: Couldn’t unmount disk.)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qkBjb.png" alt="Disk Utility - Repair Disk"  It sounds like my hard drive has failed (or is in the process of failing) - the only things that I makes me second guess myself and make me wonder if the disk is salvageable are:  ul liThe non-Time Machine partition appears to mount correctly and can be used as usual (although as mentioned above it cannot be unmounted)/li liThe drive is not that old all: probably about 18 months old. I have drives that are older that are still ticking along nicely./li /ul  Is this a simple case of a failed drive (perhaps a defective product) or is this a symptom of a software related problem (e.g. there have been several instances where the drive has been unplugged without being ejected correctly)?  <answer128891> I would guess it's most likely a logic corruption/error and not a physical corruption of the drive since the other partition seems unharmed. This has a chance of happening if you are writing/reading data and suddenly unplug your drive. Can't be 100% certain so if I were you I would definitely try to backup the other partition to another drive in case it fails as well.  em(If you could post a picture of how the drive appears in Disk Utility it would be great!)/em  WD has a 3(?) year warranty (you can check the warranty status of your drive here) on HDD's that suddenly fail which would cover a manufacturing error.  Before going through the tedious RMA process I would try to:br strong1)/strong Unplug the drivebr strong2)/strong Reboot the Mac (without the drive connected)br strong3)/strong Connect the drivebr strong4)/strong Open Disk Utility again and try to repair/fix the partitionbr strong5)/strong Run codesudo diskutil verifyVolume /dev/diskN/code (where N is the strongvolume/strong name not the disk name) to try and see if the file system structure can be read at all.    strong6)/strong Depending on the outcome of the command (it should return something like "the volume X appears to be ok" if it's fine) I would try to repair it with codesudo diskutil repairVolume /dev/diskN/code    strong7)/strong As a last resort, run codesudo diskutil eraseDisk {Format} {NewName} /dev/diskN/code (replace {Format} and {NewName} with your preferred file system and new name for the drive) which will try to erase the disk and apply a new file system. This will remove your previous partitions and you will lose the data on the disk.  If I'm being stubborn I would try to find a good disk repair software and run that to diagnose the drive before doing the RMA-process.  <answer129407> So the drive turned out to be alright but Disk Utility was not able to rectify (and exhibited the symptoms listed above). I managed to salvage the drive by erasing it using Disk Management on Windows (where both partitions showed up as 'Healthy') and reformatting it on the Mac.   <answer150487> I had the same problem and resolved it like this.  ol liUnplugged the drive/li liTurned off Time Machine in Pref/li liRebooted the Mac/li liPlugged the drive back in/li liThe Time Machine partition mounted/li /ol  <answer155076> I rebooted the iMac and replugged the WD Time Machine 3 times --it would not mount and "could not be found".  Wondering if it simply might be the cable connection I twisted the cable so I could insert the plug into its reverse position.   It immediately mounted as it should as the lighting bolt plugs are reversible.  Perhaps it was just a bad connection on a pin in the plug.  Might need a new cable.   <answer222888> I had the same problem with my year-old external drive (3 TB Macbook) – the Time Machine partition wouldn't mount, and the other partition was fine but wouldn't eject.   Ended up reformatting the drive using a different computer (which read both partitions as "healthy"). Works fine now, though I wish I'd known and tried some of the sudo commands first! Wonder if this is something happening in Yosemite/El Capitan; never had this problem previously.  <answer227179> The Time Machine partition was not being recognised but the non-time machine partition was being recognised. I couldn't repair or even erase/reformat the Time Machine partition through Disk Utility as it just didn't recognise it.  I then split the non-time machine partition into 2 separate partitions with the intention of using one of them as a new Time Machine partition. However once the partition had been completed my mac then recognised the old Time Machine partition and everything worked as normal from then on - no idea why doing the additional partition solved it, but it did!   <comment150977> Thanks! I've added the screenshot and ran through the steps you suggested. Not looking good though: the distil commands all yield the error message: POSIX reports: Exec format error. I'll try and contact WD to see if I can get it replaced (which would be a bonus - I expected to have to write it off). <comment305436> I was in the same situation. Disk was still (physically) fine but I found no way to fix the partitions, so i had to erase it and start a new backup from the beginning. <comment315383> For me step 6 was to enable Time Machine backups again and then everything was back to normal.
