What does a "o" symbol instead of "3G" or "E" mean? <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   iPhone data connection types       I sometimes get a strong"o"/strong icon instead of the "strong3G/strong" or "strongE/strong" icons when I loose my connection to the network. Why?  Could this be due to a jailbreak?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AUHry.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer43095> It means you are using the slower GPRS connection. Probably because there's no 3G/EDGE connection or the signal strength for 3G/EDGE is very weak at your location.  Nothing to do with your jailbreaking.  <answer43097> You are connected to GPRS/1xRTT since other network connection types are not available.  h2iOS 5.1 status icons/h2  On GSM (All but Verizon):  ul li3G = UTMS/HSDPA/li liE = EDGE  /li listrongo = GPRS/strong/li /ul  On CDMA (Verizon):  ul li3G = EV-DO/li liE = no equivalent - not possible  /li lio = 1xRTT/li /ul  (iPhone User Manual on Page 12)  <comment48969> Please note: This answer [is pirated](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/22281/13414).
