Block Ads via AirPort <body> Is there any way to block ads via an Apple Airport? I'd rather block all ads that way so that I can block ads on my iDevices.  <answer92623> You can set the Airport base station's DNS to a service such as OpenDNS. Then make an account with OpenDNS and set up a blacklist.  <answer168069> Dnsfool supports adblocking. I found it on google. Seems a bit slow. But its free.
