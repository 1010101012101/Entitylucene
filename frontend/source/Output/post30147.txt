Personal sorting system in the finder's windows <body> Is there a way to use a personal sorting system in the finder's windows ? I don't want to sort the files and folders using the "Labels" (because of the colors). I just want to have the list ordered the way I want...  Is this possible ?  <answer41680> You could make a custom sort order using Spotlight Comments. Show the Comments column in your Finder window (codeView &gt; Show View Options/code), then enter Spotlight Comments into your files (codeFile &gt; Get Info/code) so that they sort in the order you want. You could also use these comments for Spotlight searches and smart folders.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QINf7.png" alt="Custom Sort with Spotlight Comments"  You can use Automator to add the same comment to a whole batch of files by creating an Automator Service (for contextual menu) or Application (for drag &amp; drop) and using the "Set Spotlight Comments for Finder Items" action. Make sure to change "Service receives selected" to codefiles or folders/code. To have Automator ask you what text to use for the comment, show the Options for the "Set Spotlight Comments" action and check codeShow this action when the workflow runs/code.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AZjoP.png" alt="Automator Workflow: Batch Comment"  <comment34582> In what view? In icon view, you can put them in whatever order you want. In the other views, not so much. <comment34584> Indeed, obviously not in the icon view. <comment34921> the way you want as in drag & drop to change the order? then probably no. But you can change the arrangement of lists by going to View  Arrange By.
