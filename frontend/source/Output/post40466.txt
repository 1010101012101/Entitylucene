How can I prevent turning off the locations services on managed iPhones? <body> Is it possible to disallow iPhone/iPad users to turn off the location services on their iDevices?  E.g. by configuring profiles, software or system settings, etc.  I have a client that needs to track the GPS location of their employees and doesn't want them to be able to turn off the location services in the iPhone settings.  <answer40889> well, the only way that I could find out was to use password protected Restrictions. Looks like I have to manually set the Restrictions password on each device and then turn on the Location services restriction. If anyone comes up with a better solutions, please let me know.  <comment294510> You can use Apple Configurator to load a saved image on to the devices. You can have Restrictions turned on with your settings pre-configured along with many others. You don't need to Supervise or have any profiles loaded.
