Can't access internet through network share <body> I have an MBP with the latest OSX connected to the internet through ethernet. I've created a wi-fi network with the same name as the laptop and set the WPA2 password. I then enabled internet sharing in System Preferences.  I then booted another laptop also running the latest OSX and tried to connect to that network. The network was visible and I made sure I could see the password but my other laptop was unable to connect to the wi-fi network. Both machines are on the same desk.  How can I debug this? Console seems to show nothing relevant.  <answer145550> Make sure you are strongsharing internet from Ethernet/strong to others computers strongusing WiFi/Airport/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7jNIc.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment171579> Exactly what I have. <comment174905> Could you check if you are getting IP ? If you are getting one, add router IP as DNS too, See if it helps
