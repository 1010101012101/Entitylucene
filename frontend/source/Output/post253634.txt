Resizing a partition on El Capitan 10.11.6? <body> I want to remove both codedisk0s4/code and codedisk0s5/code partitions which were created for a bootcamp install. However when I goto disk utility then try to remove the partitions from my drive, I get the following error: codeMediaKit reports not enough space on device for requested operation./code  Screenshots below:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IrEV9.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0KlQa.png" alt="enter image description here"  Here is what I get when I run codediskutil list/code  precode/dev/disk0 (internal, physical): #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER 0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.1 GB   disk0 1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1 2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            425.6 GB   disk0s2 3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3 4:                  Apple_HFS Untitled                73.4 GB    disk0s4 5:         Microsoft Reserved                         16.8 MB    disk0s5 /code/pre  After I run the command codesudo gpt -r show disk0/code :  precode      start       size  index  contents          0          1         PMBR          1          1         Pri GPT header          2         32         Pri GPT table         34          6                  40     409600      1  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B     409640  831297360      2  GPT part - 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC  831707000    1269536      3  GPT part - 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC  832976536  143274344      4  GPT part - 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC  976250880     262144           976513024      32768      5  GPT part - E3C9E316-0B5C-4DB8-817D-F92DF00215AE  976545792     227343           976773135         32         Sec GPT table  976773167          1         Sec GPT header /code/pre  I would like to keep all data currently on the Macintosh HD, if someone could help me remove the codeuntitled/code and codemicrosoft reserved/code partitions, that would be great, thanks.  <answer253636> Updated:  ol liClick on the partition to be deleted/li liClick the minus button (cannot see if that is what you did)/li liClick Apply/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KyBE5.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer253688> The command below should remove codedisk0s5/code.  precodesudo diskutil erasevolume "Free Space" "" /dev/disk0s5 /code/pre  The command below should remove codedisk0s4/code.  precodesudo diskutil erasevolume "Free Space" "" /dev/disk0s4 /code/pre  The next command expands your Macintosh HD volume (codedisk0s2/code) to contain the free space. This command will also automatically move the Recovery HD volume (codedisk0s3/code) to the end of the drive.  precodesudo diskutil resizevolume /dev/disk0s2 R /code/pre     Note: I am not sure if the prefix codesudo/code is necessary. (But, it will do no harm if you include the codesudo/code)   There are more complex steps that can be employed to remedy your problem, but I will not post these steps unless the one of the commands given above fails to work.  <comment315642> ??? The MS reserved partition is a **16.8 MB** slice, so no files to lose! But examining the partition map I would assume that the whole Boot Camp setup is hosed and your proposal won't work.
