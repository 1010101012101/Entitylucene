Need to replace a hard drive in a macbook <body> I have been asked to "replace a hard drive in a macbook".  I'm able to physically swap out the drive, but I have no idea how mac software works. I have some questions:  ol liIf I put in a new hard drive, will I have to reinstall an operating system?/li liWhen you buy a mac, do they give you a copy of the OS on disc like buying a windows PC?/li liIf the procedure much different between different flavours of macbook?/li liAre there any special tools required extra to a small philips-head screwdriver?/li /ol  <answer100873> ol liYes, the new hard drive is empty.  In fact, if it purports to have OS X on it, I would be suspicious.  I'm not sure Apple have ever supplied OS X on a separate drive.  /li li"Old" laptop Macs (before OS X Lion) were sold with an optical disc. After a certain time most have shipped without an optical drive or a disc to put in it.  In that case the internal hard drive (or SSD) was supplied with a recovery partition.  You may be able to use Lion or later on a boot-able USB./li liYes, you might want to look at iFixit's guides or Apple's support articles./li liJust Torx screws./li /ol  <answer100922> One option is to clone the drive with Carbon Copy Cloner. Insert the new drive in the MacBook and connect the old drive by using a USB SATA enclosure or some other way. Then start up from the old drive, reformat the new drive in Disk Utility, and clone the old drive to the new drive. See http://help.bombich.com/kb/usage-scenarios/i-want-to-clone-my-entire-hard-drive-to-a-new-hard-drive-or-a-new-machine.  If your Mac supports Internet Recovery mode, another option is to start up in Internet Recovery mode and restore a Time Machine backup on the new drive. If you haven't already, make a Time Machine backup of the old drive on an external drive. Then turn off the Mac, replace the old drive with the new drive, and turn the Mac on. After you select a network, the Mac will display a spinning globe icon and download a disk image of the recovery system from Apple's servers. From that point, I'm not sure if you can just restore the Time Machine backup or if you have to reformat the new drive in or install OS X first, but it should be relatively straightforward in any case. See http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4904 for more information about the recovery system and the Internet Recovery mode.

The computer boots just fine with a Mavericks HDD from another Mac Book. I contacted Apple and a senior tech told me that I would have to partition and format the drive using a running Mac before I could do the install. She clearly told me that "you cannot do a fresh install on a blank drive from the DVD" when I challenged the answer.  <comment118744> Do you know the model of the MacBook ?
