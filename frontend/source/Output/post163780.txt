How do I set a localized name for a folder? <body> I want to give a folder a localized name.  In one of Apple's articles, I found out that the ".localized" file (e.g., in ~/Downloads) is responsible for indicating this, but all of the .localized files are empty (length 0).  I can't find any documentation for the content of this file, or even if it can have any at all.  How can I make a folder whose name is "One", but whose Spanish name is "Uno"?  <answer163809> I think this page explains what you have to do:  https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/FileManagement/Conceptual/FileSystemAdvancedPT/LocalizingtheNameofaDirectory/LocalizingtheNameofaDirectory.html  <comment191797> Have a look at  https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/FileManagement/Conceptual/FileSystemAdvancedPT/LocalizingtheNameofaDirectory/LocalizingtheNameofaDirectory.html <comment191802> Tomg: Thanks! If you make this an answer, I'll mark it.
