Mounting Samba share subfolder as a desktop of particular AD user <body> I have iMacs connected to AD, I have Samba shares like this smb://local/StaffStore/.../username/.  I want to mount users's desktop from smb://local/StaffStore/.../username/Desktop without ugly scripting.  I need to do this on hundreds of iMacs, so it needs to be automated.  <comment356402> Just to be sure: you want to mount smb://sambaserver/StaffStore/.../$user/Desktop to the local /Users/$user/Desktop? <comment356601> should I do that with automator? <comment356715> $user doesn't work. <comment356722> Don't take $user literally! I wanted to ask if you really want  to mount smb://sambaserver/StaffStore/.../user1/Desktop to the local /Users/user1/Desktop? <comment356725> I need to make it parametric and automate that. In env we have HOME and username, but I can't use that in finder.
