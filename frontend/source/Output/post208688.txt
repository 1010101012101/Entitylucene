I have macosx so i can send imessages without an iphone currently and this works fine. But i also want to send messages to my family members, who don't have iphones.  <answer208756> Create contacts for your non-iPhone users in Contacts.app, then iMessage should use SMS to connect. If you use iCloud Contacts, then they become available on all devices on which you use iCloud:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pGmAy.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Below, an SMS conversation with a friend who has an Android phone, viewed on my Mac:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ilBJB.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment251769> If the OP doesn't have an iPhone, by what mechanism will his Mac send SMS messages?
