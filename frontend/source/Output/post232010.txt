iMac login screen only half displayed <body> When I booted up my iMac yesterday, I was confused to find my login field had seemingly moved upwards, so that only the bottom half was showing. The lower half of the screen was just black. Is this a screen calibration problem? The display corrects itself once I log in to show a normal desktop. I've tried rebooting.  strongReference:/strong  iMac 27", Late 2013  Running OS X El Capitan v.10.11.2  Screenshot of the problem is attached below:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/W3hN6.png" alt="Current login screen display"  <answer232100> I'd start with the standard "troubleshooting toolkit" ...br do all, in this order.  ul liReset the SMC (instructions depend on Mac model)/li liReset the NVRAM  ol liAt the boot chimes, hold kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd Opt ⌥ /kbd kbd P /kbd kbd R /kbd /li liKeep holding all 4 keys until you hear the chimes again, then release/li /ol/li liVerify &amp; if necessary Repair disk, using Disk Utility./li liFix permissions.br Before El Capitan this could also be done from Disk Utility, now it needs to be done from Terminal.br Verify permissionsbr codesudo /usr/libexec/repair_packages --verify --standard-pkgs //codebr Repair permissionsbr codesudo /usr/libexec/repair_packages --repair --standard-pkgs --volume //code/li liReset Home folder permissions &amp; ACLsbr This has also become more complex since El Capitan because of System Integrity Protection, but is still possible by booting to Recovery Mode...    ol liAt boot, hold kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd R /kbd at the chimes/li liAt the recovery screen, open Terminal from the Utilities menu.  /li liType in coderesetpassword/code and hit Return\Enter.
