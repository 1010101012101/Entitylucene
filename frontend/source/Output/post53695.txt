Activate fluid app pinned to status from Quicksilver <body> I use Fluid apps that are pinned to my status bar. If I click on the icon in the status bar, the Fluid app will get focus. I'd like to be able to give an app focus from Quicksilver instead of having to click on the status bar icon. Is there any way to do that? Executing the corresponding app in /Applications doesn't have the desired effect.
