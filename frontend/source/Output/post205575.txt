How to change the default font and size in Notes on El Capitan? <body> Editing codeDefaultFonts.plist/code doesn't seem working anymore on the pre-release build 15A279b of El Capitan:  precodesudo vim /Applications/Notes.app/Contents/Resources/en.lproj/DefaultFonts.plist /code/pre  It still shows that the file is readonly. I guess it's because the new System Integrity Protection feature.  Is there another way to change the default font in Notes app?  <answer208906> And the keyboard's plists of PressAll also can no longer be modified to add the new accents.  strongTip:/strong You do not need to modify the default font and size in Notes.   To change the font, you can select all or one sentence and press kbdCmd/kbd + kbdT/kbd.   To change the font size, you can press kbdCmd/kbd, kbdShift/kbd and kbd+/kbd at the same time to increase or kbdCmd/kbd + kbd-/kbd to decrease the size.  strongAnother tip:/strong If you want to use the user font in Notes in OS X, please, install and use AnyFont in iOS to install your favourite font in iOS.   <answer218387> Workaround: Pushing kbdCmd/kbd-kbd+/kbd increments the font size by one point each time.  The default body font size is 12 point. So, if you want to get your notes to be 16 point, just always press kbdCmd/kbd-kbd+/kbd four times after starting a new  note.  (and go to Format menu, New Notes Start With, and make sure Body is checked)  <answer242671> Here's what worked for me on El Capitan:  1.Disable System Integrity Protection    ul liRestart your mac   /li liPress and hold CMD+R to boot in recovery/li liIn the menu bar select utilitiesterminal/li liType csrutil disable/li liReboot/li /ul  2.Change font size:  ul liFire up the terminal and type in  cd /Applications/Notes.app/Contents/Resources /li liThen  sudo nano pad.css/li liIn the editor replace the @[FONT-SIZE] with your font size./li licontrol+X and then select Y and then return./li /ul  Start your notes app and you should see the difference :)  strong[EDIT]/strong  To switch on (or re-activate) SIP, repeat the steps at '1' above. However, instead of using codecsrutil disable/code in Terminal, use codecsrutil enable/code.  <comment252265> Thanks for the tip, Gustavo! I do however want to change the default font, because it's troublesome to change the font for every time I create a new note. <comment258720> @hujunfeng did you figure out how to change the default font size ? I am having the same problem. Might switch to using evernote because of this. <comment258771> @gprasant, no I still don't know how to do it. It might not be possible with El Capitan unfortunately. <comment274407> `defaults read com.apple.Notes NoteFont` (?) <comment336827> This doesn't answer OP's question of how to change *default* font.
