Keyboard and trackpad not working, SMC reset seems possible <body> I have a MacBook Pro, 13-inch, Mid 2009 with OS X 10.9.5.  I suspect two things that might have caused the trouble:  ol liRecently I had to replace the keyboard. After replacing the keyboard everything worked fine for a while./li liI have also recently failed installing Windows with Bootcamp. The keyboard and trackpad worked before./li /ol  Now the keyboard and trackpad do not work at all. Though doing an SCM reset by using kbdShift/kbd kbdControl/kbd kbdOption/kbd and power keys seems to work as the macbook doesn't boot and I see the battery LED light up for a second or two (I'm using the Resetting the SMC on portables with a battery you should not remove on your own method). The power button works normally.  So the question is: Is it a hardware problem or a software problem? What should I do to make it work again? Is it worth it to do a clean system reinstall?  strongUpdate:/strong System reinstall didn't help. I got back the keyboard backlight, but pressing the keys or using the trackpad still doesn't work.  strongUpdate #2:/strong After one and a half years both the trackpad and the keyboard woke up of the coma and are working as if nothing has happened.  <answer149126> There's a very simple way to see if this is a software or hardware problem.  Power on your machine and hold down strongCommand-V/strong.  This is the shortcut for verbose boot.  If the keyboard works at boot, but not at a login window, its software.  If you cannot perform startup commands properly, it is a hardware issue, as no software is loaded this early in the startup sequence.  If it ends up being hardware, possibly a poor cable connections has caused it since the machine was opened recently.  <answer161730> In my case my macbook's keyboard was disabled after being connected to a miscellaneous bluetooth keyboard somewhere in my house. I used keyboard shortcuts to get to System Preferences and disable bluetooth and fixed the problem that way.  If your computer is connected to both a trackpad and a keyboard via bluetooth, you might alternatively have to locate that bluetooth device and use it to disable bluetooth and/or remove one of the devices.  Lastly, a solution is to move the laptop out of range of interfering bluetooth device, then turn off bluetooth once you have regained control.  <comment175678> It's probably worth checking how well you put the connector strips back together... <comment175679> Did that already. That was my first thought too. Maybe I should give it another go, though I think I cannot put it better than I did. <comment175681> None of the startup commands work. So I thought it's a hardware issue. What puzzles me is, that I can use the keyboard to do an SMC reset. Can you explain why? <comment175685> Likely because your not actually resetting the SMC, merely holding down the power button to force the machine to power off and reboot. <comment175686> No, I do not force a power off. The machine is already shut down/powered off. Then I press Shift + Control + Option + Power key together. The machine does not boot, but the battery LED lights up for a second, so it somehow recognises the keys of the built in keyboard. <comment175693> @Tetsujin It just tried to fix the connector strips multiple times, even with my old keyboard (which is missing a few buttons). No luck. <comment175694> still sounding like the connector... what was wrong with the old keyboard, btw? <comment175695> @Tetsujin My wife tried to kill my MacBook by letting it drown first and then baking it in the oven. The old keyboard melted partially. I haven't been there and couldn't stop it. It's a miracle that the MacBook came to life again. <comment175698> ouch, just... ouch. <comment175709> "...letting it drown first and then baking it in the oven." <comment175721> Is the battery swollen by chance, or did that survive the drowning?  Seen issues with older models not working because the battery has swollen up against the keyboard connections. <comment175806> @tron_jones The battery looks ok. I already tried without battery, but it didn't help. Below the battery is the trackpad, but the keyboard connections are not in that model. You can see it in [this image](https://d3nevzfk7ii3be.cloudfront.net/igi/ECPvZBslmXdfVx4A.huge). The trackpad connector cables go below the battery; the keyboard connector cables go below the logic board (just the opposite direction - it's not visible in the image). <comment176995> Interesting, let us know what you figure out on it. <comment289902> Also alt key.
