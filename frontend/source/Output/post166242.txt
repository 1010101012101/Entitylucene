How to get file path of user selected .icns file in applescript? <body> I'm writing an applescript in which I need the POSIX path to an code.icns/code file that the user selects. For some reason though, it refuses to accept code.icns/code as a valid file type.  This will work:  precodeset Icon to (POSIX path of (choose file of type {"png"} with prompt "Select a .png file.")) /code/pre  But this won't:  precodeset Icon to (POSIX path of (choose file of type {"icns"} with prompt "Select a .icns file.")) /code/pre  When the script is run, it won't let me choose any files, including .icns files.  Any ideas? Thanks.  Also, I'm running 10.8.5 if it helps, and if there is an easy way to convert .png files to .icns files with applescript, I'm open to that too.  <answer166245> Use code{"com.apple.icns"}/code as the file type.  precodeset Icon to (POSIX path of (choose file of type {"com.apple.icns"} with prompt "Select a .icns file.")) /code/pre  hr  (Found by running "mdls myiconfile.icns")  precodekMDItemContentType             = "com.apple.icns" /code/pre
