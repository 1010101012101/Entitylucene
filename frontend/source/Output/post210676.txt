Download 'El Capitan', 'Mavericks' or 'Yosemite' from external link <body> The HDD of my MacBook Pro (2012) dies and I bought a new one. The problem is that I don't have another Mac to download the OS from Apple Store...  Someone know from where can I download the OS El Capitan, Mavericks or Yosemite to install it and then download 'El Capitan' and from Apple Store and make a clean installation?  <answer210682> If you've updated your MacBook Pro with the newest firmware update you may start to Internet Recovery Mode and reinstall the original OS X (probably Lion).  ul liInstall your new HDD/li liDetach any external drive (especially any external Time Machine backup drive)./li liRestart to Internet Recovery Mode by pressing kbdalt/kbd kbdcmd/kbd kbdR/kbd at startup.br The prerequisites are the latest firmware update installed, either ethernet or WLAN (WPA/WPA2) and a router with DHCP activated.br On a 50 Mbps-line it takes about 4 min (presenting a small animated globe) to boot to a recovery netboot image which usually is loaded from an apple/akamai server.  I recommend ethernet because it's more reliable. If you are restricted to WIFI and the boot process fails, just restart your Mac until you succeed booting./li liIn the opening window choose emDisk Utility/em./li liPartition your drive: 1 (or more) partition, GUID partition table, Journaled HFS+./li liQuit Disk Utility and open emRestore OS X/em/li liChoose your new volume to install OS X there./li liAfter successfully installing and configuring OS X, open App Store and install the latest OS X (El Capitan)./li /ul  <comment254250> BTW I have downloaded several torrents but are 'Virtual Machine Disk Format'...
