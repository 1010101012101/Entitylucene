iPhone 5S storage filled with "Documents and Data" <body> My phone's internal storage has been pretty full recently- so I plugged it into my computer and iTunes said that somewhere around 11GB of my 11.7GB was "Documents and Data". But according to Manage Storage, none of the apps come close to filling that much space, and I even clicked into each one to check that iOS didn't flub up and not add Docs&amp;Data to the total storage. I've been googling this for a emfew/em hours now, and I'm starting to lose hope of any solution other than resetting it.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ULgZe.png" alt="storage page" hr img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LEs4K.png" alt="docs and data"  Other things I've tried include:   ul liDeleting all the photos and then from Recently Deleted/li liDialing back the time and checking Recently Deleted (nothing there)/li liDeleting other things (freed up space for a few minutes but Documents and Data expanded to take up the freed space)/li liClearing caches for safari, etc (again, freed up a puny bit of space which was then instantly engulfed by Documents and Data)/li liI don't stream movies or tv shows or even youtube videos very often, if ever/li /ul  Any help is appreciated  <answer248884> h3Short answer:/h3  Restore to Factory Defaults  h3Long answer:/h3  I had essentially this situation 3 weeks ago, although my capacity was "consumed" by Other.  ul liiPhone 5S 32GB/li liiOS 9.3.2 (later updated to 9.3.3)/li lisynced with iTunes 12.4.1.6/li lion Mac mini OS X 10.11.5/li /ul  The iPhone Settings  General  About  Available showed 0.25GB.  When syncing with iTunes, it showed unstable capacity numbers on each sync -- occasionally over-capacity with Other consuming 4.6GB, but settled down to 5.5GB available.  The 5GB discrepancy was concerning.  I tried:  ul lirebooting = nothing/li lihard reset (Lock + Home, past Apple logo, to plug-in-to-iTunes image) &amp; update (re-install iOS) = freed 60MB/li liiOS update to 9.3.3 = nothing/li /ul  The final option was what prior searching had said all along -- Restore to Factory Defaults.  I just followed Apple's procedure and it freed 9.5GB!

I used the security code, which generated an iCloud Keychain verification code that was sent to the iPhone, which was in the middle of setting it up, so it showed momentarily and moved on.

(By the way, hard reset means a restart using hardware, which in this case is the power button. A soft reset is a restart using software, which is the power off slider. The power button just invokes the power off slider, and doesn't actually restart the phone for you.)
