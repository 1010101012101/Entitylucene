Why can't I navigate to /.ssh folder on jailbroken iPhone 5S <body> I have installed OpenSSH on my jailbroken iPhone 5S, I am trying to set up ssh keys for it but I need to get to my /.ssh folder. I try to cd there while at root with cd ~/.ssh but it says "not a directory". I then tried mkdir ~/.ssh and get "cannot make directory: file exists". So once again I tried to cd ~/.ssh and still nada. I navigated to ~ and ls, and once again no .ssh directory.   precode$ ls -ad ~/.ssh /var/root/.ssh $ echo ~ /var/root /code/pre  <answer115908> Looks like code.ssh/code is a file and not a directory. Either remove the file (coderm ~/.ssh/code) or rename it (codemv ~/.ssh ~/.ssh-strange/code) and set up your ssh keys again.  <comment135616> `.ssh` seems to be a file, not a directory. Can you add the output of `ls -ad ~/.ssh` and `echo ~` to your question? <comment135618> youre right it is indeed a file <comment135619> the directory didnt get created when I copied my key using scp it instead created .ssh as a file. Thanks
