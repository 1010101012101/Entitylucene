Autodeleting resource forks on FAT disks <body> I totally hate to see those .dsstore and resource files on my Windows disks.  Is there a emfree/em program that will autodelete those files on specified disks on logout/eject?  <answer26127> There are many ways to remove .DS_Store files; it really depends on what your exact needs are for the method you decide to use. To automatically remove them when you login/logout would be quite different from ejecting a disk, since it's a completely different process. You can disallow .DS_store for from being allowed to write to network disks, etc. by opening up Terminal and entering:  precodedefaults write com.apple.desktopservices DSDontWriteNetworkStores true /code/pre  to manually remove already present .DS_Store files you can use:  precodedot_clean /path/folder /code/pre  which merges any such files with the parent file.  <answer94429> Resource forks don't exist as actual forks anymore. They have been stored as extended attributes since 10.4.  The files that start with ._ are used to store extended attributes, ACLs, and HFS file attributes / Finder flags. They can be deleted with dot_clean or find:  precodedot_clean /Volumes/Volume find /Volumes/Volume -name ._\* -delete /code/pre  .DS_Store files can be deleted with find:  precodefind /Volumes/Volume -name .DS_Store -delete /code/pre  Another option is to use BlueHarvest:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pZZ0M.png" alt=""  <comment29813> .dsstore and resource files aren't in the same category. For some files, deleting the resource fork will result in substantial data loss. <comment29841> for me are in the same category: litter. Of course I won't move system files on a windows disk (why I should), so I think it's 100% safe to delete them. <comment29842> it's possible to run this command at the logout? <comment29844> It's possible to run commands (in the form of a shell script) at logout using what Apple calls a LogoutHook, but the exact method varies depending on the exact version of OS X you're running. [Here](http://my.opera.com/mereh/blog/2011/07/30/apple-osx-mute-startup-sound-chime-in-osx-10-7-lion-and-others) is the general method I've used in the past. The [Secrets](http://secrets.blacktree.com/) pref pane from Blacktree also has an option for specifying a LogoutHook script. <comment29845> @scottishwildcat â€” awesome explanation and tips! ;-)
