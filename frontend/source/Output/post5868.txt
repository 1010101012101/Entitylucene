Custom "mouse" gestures for Trackpad on Macbook Pro and Magic mouse <body> Is it possible to create custom gestures for Macbook Pro Trackpad and Magic Mouse to custom actions? For example to close a window or launch some application.  <answer5869> Not so sure about the Magic Mouse, but for the trackpad there are a number of options.  strongjitouch/strong looks very customisable, but costs.  strongBetterTouchTool/strong works with the Magic Mouse. It gives you a PrefPane that lets you assign loads of gestures with loads of actions, including opening Apps. I'm sure it has capability to close windows as well.   Hope this helps!  <answer29548> Another useful tool is MagicPrefs, although it really shines with the trackpad.  <comment6084> How customized do you want? My popular apps are all custom-swipe-launchable: Swipe to dock on right, the adjust vertically, then click :). <comment6085> @mankoff: the ones I'd like to have the most are hide/close/quit gestures, since that's what's making me touch the keyboard <comment6101> +1 for BetterTouchTool. It allowed me to create some unusual gestures (rotate left and right, for example) that save time every day.
