How to bring back multi-touch gestures after it crashes without reboot? <body> After a clean install of Yosemite, multi-touch gestures have stopped working on two occasions on my Macbook Pro 2011. Each time, the symptoms are the same:  ul liGestures stopped working both built-in trackpad and bluetooth trackpad./li liBetterTouchTool still works. Restarting, stopping BTT doesn't help./li liHey, at least two-finger click - right click still works./li /ul  I've tried the following:  ul liToggling trackpad configurations doesn't bring back the gestures./li liDisconnecting, reconnecting, removing bluetooth trackpad from list of bluetooth devices doesn't work./li /ul  Restarting solves the problem. However, a restart in my case is a time-consuming process. It involves properly shutting down apps, dismounting network storage, disconnecting VPN, etc - only to revert all the steps again on startup.  I suspect the process interpreting multi-touch crashed when the malfunction happened. CPU was quite busy at both point. So I wonder if there is a process I can call up when it happens again, to avoid restarting the machine.   <answer153308> Hit the same issue. Found this old thread, where user codefrimp/code advises to press power button and let MBP sleep for a while, some 5-10 seconds is enough. Then wake it up — gestures are back.br Further search shows this issue is quite old, at least since mid 2012.  Though I would really like to get this fixed permanently…  <answer154733> I'm having the same issue periodically only since upgrading to Yosemite (I did not do a clean install.) For me it has been affecting only 4 finger swipes (all 4 directions are completely unrecognized) on both the built-in trackpad and on a BT magic trackpad.  Interestingly, the problem went away for me (at least for the moment) without a reboot after I killed a process that was misbehaving.  I saw errors in the console once per second with the following text: codeassertion failed: 14A389: libxpc.dylib + 40320/code  For me these messages are attributed to the Spokes app (a Plantronics helper application for my headset), though I have seen it reported for other different applications on Yosemite as well.  It may be anecdotal that the gestures started working again after I killed the offending app, but I'll watch to see if there's a correlation in the future, since this problem has come and gone a few times since my upgrade and it's not my first time killing this app nor my first time with gestures resuming without a reboot.  <answer155853> I found a faster solution. In settings → trackpad, disable all scroll and zoom gestures, then reenable them. The trackpad should start working again almost immediately (at least it did when I tried it).  <answer171529> precodekillall Dock /code/pre  In the terminal fixed this for me.   In my case, only Mission Control gestures had stopped working (three finger swipe left/right to switch spaces, three finger swipe up for overview).  <answer181107> By my experience, multi-touch crashes on a per-app basis. I could quit the app and relaunch it, and gestures would be back.  Apparently, sleeping the display and then waking up the system again will bring back crippled gesture. You can click button to do that, or just close the lid, or use terminal:  precodepmset displaysleepnow; sleep 5; caffeinate -u -t 1 /code/pre  After one second of black screen, gestures are back.  (P.S.: I'm answering my question here, so if it works for you, upvote and I will mark it as emaccepted/em)  <answer262589> One trick which I learnt about from a similar problem here using Steam.   Create a copy of the "BetterTouchTool.app" and call it something like "BetterTouchTool2.app". When it stops working, just open "BetterTouchTool2.app". This should allow you to continue using it without a restart.  <comment216536> this worked perfectly and instantly too, thanks :) <comment227291> This worked for me.  SomeDude's answer (disable/enable all scroll and zoom gestures) did not. <comment244835> Worked perfectly, Thank you! <comment257533> This works perfectly. <comment269880> You are a god among men. <comment274975> When this happens to me it's not Mission Control *gestures* that stop working, it's Mission Control—keyboard shortcuts also fail. <comment284863> I was periodically losing two finger swipe in firefox.  This answer restores functionality. <comment320035> I shall name my next child after you. <comment339784> You sir, are a gentleman, scholar and a rock star. <comment339785> I think Trey needs his answer credit. <comment347840> thank you! I thought I'd have to restart and then have to restart the millions of virtual development servers I'm running as a result. <comment349878> This worked with my Magic Trackpad 2 as well. <comment363575> Let it sleep works!
