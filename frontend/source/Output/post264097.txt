I tried to delete code~/Library/Preferences/com.applde.finder.plist/code and code~/Library/Preferences/com.applde.sidebarlist.plist/code - almost all preferences are reset strongexcept/strong list of favourites - it remains  <answer264113> The sidebar's favourites are managed by codesharedfilelistd/code which is an XPC service, don't try to manipulate it manually. This way lies pain and suffering.  <answer264606> Thanks to @TonyWilliams for the starting point and after a brief research I realized that requested sidebar's favourites are stored actually in directory code~/Library/Application Support/com.apple.sharedfilelist//code, the file codecom.apple.LSSharedFileList.FavoriteItems.sfl/code among other files which are responsible for other sidebar sections. But those files are not available for easy editing.  Starting from OSX El Capitan and newer versions there is a command-line tool strongsfltool/strong availabe to make some operations with that files, such as emadd an item/em. But this tools doesn't have ability to remove items (the root of my problem which causes to this research) and I found another good tool on GitHub called strongmysides/strong which allows to remove items as well.  <comment331514> Hi @Tony, thanks for that knowledge. Maybe you can help with following: In my sidebar the Desktop icon appears from time to time and I cannot remove it permanently <comment331618> If it's appearing then disappearing there's something seriously wrong with your install. If it refuses to disappear then I suspect that the OS just automatically replaces it at boot, but I'd have to do some testing :) <comment331647> That allowed me to see that the permanently appearing item cannot be deleted. When I tried to delete (see [first screenshot](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/15119356/scs1.png)) "Desktop" item I got an error, but the command `mysides list` helped me to try firstly remove AirDrop from list (via Finder Preferences) and repeat operation on the updated list. The result [was positive](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/15119356/scs2.png) <comment331715> Not to mention that `sfltool` is awful. You can't check to see if an item already exists. You can't specify where it gets added and if you add it twice it will be in the list twice.  As I said, futzing with the Sidebar is pain and suffering.
