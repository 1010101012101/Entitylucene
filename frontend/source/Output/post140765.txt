Does mdfind allow wildcard searches on filename? <body> I'm trying to figure out how to perform wildcard searches for filenames with mdfind on OsX? I tried: codemdfind -name "*.pdf"/code but it didn't work.  EDIT: I want to be able to find names like "test*.pdf"  <answer140791> This should work:  precodemdfind "kMDItemDisplayName == test*.pdf" /code/pre  Enclose the pattern in single quotes and add 'c' to match case-insensitively:  precodemdfind "kMDItemDisplayName == 'test*.pdf'c" /code/pre  Here is a list of available attributes. You can combine multiple attribute/value pairs with code&amp;&amp;/code.  <comment188544> `mdfind` is such a pain to use! As an alternative, `locate` comes preinstalled, so if you sync the index (with `sudo /usr/libexec/locate.updatedb`), you can use it instead, and avoid learning the `mdfind` syntax. Of course, the huge disadvantage is that you would need to sync manually. See also https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man8/locate.updatedb.8.html NB: Just to clarify: `locate` is not using Spotlight, but for Linux users would probably be more familiar. <comment196241> Below is a pseudo locate that uses mdfind you can add to your bash initialization. `function mdname () {     if [ $1 = "-i" ]; then         shift         mdfind "kMDItemDisplayName == '$@'c"     else         mdfind "kMDItemDisplayName == $@"     fi }`  - the best of both worlds though messed up by the inability to add formatted code to comments so you'd need to add ;'s or new lines as in the original where those big gaps are.
