How do I open X11 on Mac OS X? Is it possible to add an icon to my applications folder? <body> How do I directly open codeX11/code on my mac?   How can I add the codeX11/code icon to the applications folder?  <answer205210> I'd recommend installing XQuartz, which is a very nice X server for OS X.  <comment247448> I have X11 installed. I'm just not sure how to open it directly. <comment247450> Do you mean X11 installed by `homebrew` or the like, and you're wanting to run X applications under OS X? Still the same advice; the homebrew-x11 page (https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-x11) suggests installing XQuartz via homebrew (which will add the Quartz app to the Applications folder); any other X11 apps installed will use it - though I believe you'll need to launch it first before running the X application(s). <comment247451> I understand your point now. I use MacPorts, so I believe the correct port is `quartz-wm`. I'll give it a try. Thanks!
