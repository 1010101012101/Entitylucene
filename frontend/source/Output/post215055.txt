Is it 'safe' to use FN for custom shortcuts <body> I'd like to create my own shortcut combinations, and it looks to me that the kbdfn/kbd key is actually only used for a few shortcuts on OS X. For example, kbdfn/kbd-kbddelete/kbd is forward delete. In applications like Photoshop it's not used.  Are you aware of any applications that uses kbdfn/kbd shortcuts? I don't want to create potential conflicts. If feels strange to think that no software is using such a simple key, and they go for the more complex kbdoption/kbd-kbdcommand/kbd-kbdshift/kbd combinations instead.  Just to be clear, I'm referring to the use of the kbdfn/kbd key (eg. the one usually on the lower left side of a MacBook Air's keyboard), not to the function keys (kbdF1/kbd to kbdF19/kbd) found at the top of the keyboard.  <answer215060> For the most part, function keys are only used by OSX and not third-party programs, but some programs use the F1 key for accessing the help menu. Also if you are into games, some games like Just Cause 2 might have some conflicts with it, as (I believe) the F1 and F2 keys are used for opening in-game map etc.  Also forgot to mention, if you have dictation enabled you might want to disable the "FN double-tap" activation shortcut... Goes without saying. Too many times have I accidentally hit the FN key twice, and creating custom shorcuts with it will make you more prone to accidentally activating dictation.  <comment259730> How do you intend to assign these shortcuts? System Preferences/Keyboard doesn't seem to accept them, neither does Keyboard Maestro. <comment259734> Using Karabiner <comment259735> You can assign shortcuts to FN if FN is associated to a function button F1...F12 in System Preferences  Keyboard. <comment259744> @mgiordi It looks you're right...I wonder why apple wouldn't want customers to take advantage of that FN key, it would be great for additional shortcuts? <comment259757> The user is referring to the fn key, not the F1-F19 keys. <comment259942> @IronCraftMan Right, sorry! Will edit :)
