Unable to invite Team Admin to Apple Developer Team - Invalid Email <body> I recently had to help a client enroll into Apple Developer program as an organization. When we tried adding me as a team admin as per instructions here:   https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/ManagingYourTeam/ManagingYourTeam.html  it rejected the provided email address as invalid.  The address format is "firstname.lastname@companyname.com.au"  The email address in question is my work email that I use all the time. Is there anything that I missed?  Some additional notes:br - The client has otherwise successfully enrolled into the programbr - The email address in question was successfully used in iTunes Connect to add myself as an App Managerbr - The email address in question is not enrolled into the Developer Program on its own (but I was not under the impression that this was necessary, perhaps I missed this in the documentation). The client's Apple ID, however, is enrolled.  <comment369828> Is the email which failed already in use for an existing Developer account? <comment369831> Nope. I've used it as an Apple ID, but it's not enrolled in a Developer program otherwise in any capacity.
