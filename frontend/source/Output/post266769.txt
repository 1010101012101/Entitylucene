How to see a table of all keybindings across the operating system? <body> I've had an issue for some time now wherein when I initially boot macOS, text-to-speech will not work when I press codeOption-Escape/code.  Notwithstanding, when I go into codeSystem Preferences/code - codeAccessibility/code - codeSpeech/code and click "Change Key..." button and then simply hit OK (since codeOption-Esc/code is already selected), I can then press codeopt-esc/code to activate text-to-speech once again as such at will.  Is there a way to build a table to view all keybindings / shortcuts that are active at a given moment rather than having to go into codeSystem Preferences/code - codeKeyboard/code - codeShortcuts/code and unsuccessfully poke around?
