Mac menu bar not showing some icons? <body> I'm running Yosemite 10.10.1 on a MacBook Air (early 2014), and I'm not seeing some icons on menu bar and folder and on browsers too. I have been trying to look for what's wrong on System Preferences, but I can't seem to find the answers! I attached the images to make it more clear. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AKoT5.jpg" alt="screen shot for my osx 10.10.1 "  <answer169788> To boot up in safe mode you can hold down the shift key when restarting.  I would go to the Finder and open any window and right click or control click in the gray part of title bar. See what your settings are set to.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XFzcK.png" alt="screen shot of icon and text option"  There is also a new update to the system 10.10.2 that was just released. Maybe this will fix it, along with a bunch of other problems we have all been having with Yosemite. (I hope! :).  As far as the menu icons, I know that some of the system settings as in airplay there is a button that says "Show mirroring options in the menu bar when available" and there are more I am sure.  Good luck my friend.   <comment192051> Does it happen in another account? <comment192110> did not check let me check with the guest account!! <comment192113> @ganbustein i did login as a guest and the icons were there, as matter of fact even when i'm logging i do see the icons but as soon as i'm on the account there are gone. <comment192231> It might be worth doing a Safe Boot. It looks like maybe some icon cache is messed up. Safe Boot causes some caches to be re-built. Admittedly, I see nothing about icon caches in the documentation for Safe Boot (or anywhere else for that matter), but it might be worth a shot. <comment192284> so how do i launch safe mode, I'm also running but campo,with windows 7. <comment192285> @ganbustein thanks  any tips, for safe mode <comment192294> @ganbustein thanks a lot irun safe mode and after restart the icons showed up. thanks foor the tip. <comment192297> @ganbustein  got twitter!!? <comment222617> @drexx did you figure out a solution for this? I had the same issue but restarting my mac fixed it. Don't know what caused it. <comment222893> @Kostub Deshmukh booting in safe mode and restart the computer did work for me
