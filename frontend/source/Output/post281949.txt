Contact names are duplicated when using a smart group <body> In Apple Contacts I searched and merged duplicates. When I start a message in Gmail, if I type in the name of a smart group from Apple Contacts, all the names in the group are duplicated in the To: box. If I type in one name from the same group it is not duplicated. I tried searching and merging duplicates, this didn't help. I have an iMac with macOS Sierra; I'm using iCloud.  <comment354912> What do you mean, all the names in the group are "duplicated"? <comment355437> Each name in the group appears twice
