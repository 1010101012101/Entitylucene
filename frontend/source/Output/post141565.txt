What does an icon that looks like a pair of connected chain links next to a wireless network name mean? <body> When I click on the WiFi symbol in the menu bar on my Mac I get a list of wireless networks, most of them with little lock icons next to them. But some of them show what looks like a pair of chain links instead (see image below). What does this mean? That these networks are personal hotspots?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mIfW3.png" alt="WiFi icons"  <answer141566> It's a personal hotspot created by an iOS device to share the cellular data connection that the phone has over Wi-Fi.  <comment166830> The symbol also appears with bluetooth and USB hotspots.
