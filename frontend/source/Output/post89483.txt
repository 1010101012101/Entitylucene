How to losslessly rotate rotate jpeg images *without* a change to the last modified date? <body> I'm looking for some convenient tool to handle such rotation without changing the file timestamps.  <answer89485> I'm not aware of any image tools that have this functionality built in, but you can use the built-in UNIX touch command to adjust the timestamps.  ol liIn Terminal, run codetouch -r photo.jpeg timestamp/code. That will create an empty file named codetimestamp/code with the timestamp of your image (replace codephoto.jpeg/code with the path to your file)./li liEdit your file however you want./li liIn Terminal, run codetouch -r timestamp photo.jpeg/code. That will copy the timestamp from the codetimestamp/code file back to your image file./li liRemove the timestamp file: coderm timestamp/code./li /ol  <answer89623> codefor f in *.jpg; do jpegtran -rotate 90 "$f" &gt; "$f.temp"; touch -r "$f" "$f.temp"; mv "$f.temp" "$f"; done/code  jpegtran is part of libjpeg. touch -r also changes the creation time if the target time is before it.  <comment105039> I'm afraid this is hardly convenient <comment105040> If you need the workflow simplified, you could put this into an Automator workflow along with an image rotation action.
