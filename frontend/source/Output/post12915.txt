Why does ssh log me in as the wrong user? <body> I am shelling into my Mac (ssh) and get logged in with the wrong userid. There are three unprivileged user accounts on the system, and when I log in, I give my password, and whoami gives me either of the other unprivileged user accounts. (And I can't write to files I own, etc.)  I can workaround to access my account by su [emmy username/em], but I'm puzzled. Any suggestions?  <answer12916> codessh/code can get confused if your short name is different between the two machines. You can check what your short name is on each machine with codewhoami/code. To go to a particular account, use codessh jhayward@mymac/code. If you still have trouble, use codessh -v jhayward@mymac/code. You may see things like checking code~/.ssh/config/code. If you want to avoid typing codejhaward@/code all of the time, you can make (or add to) the file code~/.ssh/config/code with the lines  precodeHost mymac Hostname 1234.1234.1234 User jhaward /code/pre  editing each line for your particular case (the codeHost/code is your nickname, the codeHostname/code is the IP address, or mymac.local or whatever you currently use for codessh/code).  Then you can just use codessh mymac/code.   If you still have trouble, post some output from codessh -v/code but be careful to not post anything private (like IP addresses).  <answer12917> Are you using codessh -l user host/code to ensure that the correct user name is passed through to the sshd on the receiving machine? Also, do check ~/.ssh/config for any overrides assuming you are using a command line ssh.
