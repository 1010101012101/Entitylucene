Calendars and Contacts Sync after iCloud transition <body> I have a mobile.me account that handles the synching of my personal data (mail, icals and contacts) on my 4 devices (iPod, iPad, MacBook and iMac).  when I read the docs about iCloud, it seems that this magic synching will not work anymore on 3 of my devices (non Lion and non iOS5)...  Will my contacts/calendars on my iPod (2ndGen) will never be updated anymore?   <answer41279> You're right, iCloud requires iOS 5 or later on iOS devices and OS X 10.7 (Lion) or later on Macs.  http://www.apple.com/icloud/setup/  http://www.apple.com/support/icloud/  I'm pretty sure you can still use cable sync to update the information on your older iOS devices so they can coexist when/if you migrate your Mobile me account to iCloud.  <comment46839> Once the iCloud account is set up, iCal 4.0.4 in SL can sync your calendar with it as well.  I haven't heard of any way to sync contacts yet.
