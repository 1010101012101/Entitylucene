How to separate "mouse" and "trackpad" settings? <body> In System Preferences  Mouse there's a setting "Scroll direction: natural", which I don't like, so I unset.  The problem is that this also unsets the setting for Trackpad, which I emdo/em like.    How can you have different settings for mouse and trackpad?  (In case you can't understand the rationale for wanting them different, and think this is a ridiculous question, here is the reasoning.  Mice have had scroll wheels for decades, and the direction of the wheel turning has always been in sync with the motion of the scrollbar.  This is, in my opinion, the most natural way to do things, even though it is the opposite of what Apple calls "natural".  On the other hand, I'm perfectly willing to use Apple's "natural" scrolling for trackpads, because the metaphor here is that you're moving your fingers across a page, just as if you were using an iOS device's touchscreen.  The idea that Apple treats these as the same thing, when they are conceptually strongemcompletely/em/strong different is very odd to me.  I don't want to change a decades-old habit with the mouse, just because Apple changed their idea of how a trackpad should work.  I embrace the trackpad change because it makes sense to anyone who uses an iPhone or iPad (and I use both) but I'm not willing to rewire my brain's way of using the mouse.)  <answer116625> I had the same problem when I started to use OS X.  I installed this little utility, which lets you reverse the scrolling behavior only for the mouse:  Scroll Reverser for Mac OS X  <answer145962> You can also use Karabiner:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;   &lt;devicevendordef&gt;     &lt;vendorname&gt;SOMEVENDOR&lt;/vendorname&gt;     &lt;vendorid&gt;0x1234&lt;/vendorid&gt;   &lt;/devicevendordef&gt;   &lt;deviceproductdef&gt;     &lt;productname&gt;SOMEPRODUCT&lt;/productname&gt;     &lt;productid&gt;0x0001&lt;/productid&gt;   &lt;/deviceproductdef&gt;   &lt;item&gt;     &lt;name&gt;custom&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;identifier&gt;custom&lt;/identifier&gt;     &lt;device_only&gt;DeviceVendor::SOMEVENDOR, DeviceProduct::SOMEPRODUCT&lt;/device_only&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__FlipScrollWheel__ Option::FLIPSCROLLWHEEL_VERTICAL&lt;/autogen&gt;   &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  You can see the vendor and product IDs from code/Applications/Karabiner.app/Contents/Applications/EventViewer.app/code.  <answer147629> I found myself in the exact same boat (preferring Natural for TrackPad and normal for Mouse), and in case anyone attempts to do the same, I did file a bug report against Apple for this. They closed it rather briefly with the words "This is intentional" and no other explanation.   I'm guessing that it's a common request, and they're just tired of hearing it.  <answer197396> It appears that this is integrated in the Karabiner app so it works out of the box without any custom XML (which are described above).  You'll need the following settings:  ul liKarabiner Preferences  Change Key  Karabiner core settings  Exclude devices  Don't remap Apple's pointing devices/li liKarabiner Preferences  Change Key  Pointing Device  Reverse scrolling direction  Reverse Vertical Scrolling/li /ul  Set the Enable Natural Scrolling setting in the Mouse/TrackPad PrefPane to 'enabled'. This allows for the internal trackpad to work as it's supposed to. Any connected non-Apple external mouse will scroll in their own natural way.  <answer222435> Clarifying the answer above about Karabiner Settings.  To edit the two suggested settings, do the following:  Change Key tab  Exclude Devices  Select "Don't remap Apple's pointing keyboards  Change Key tab  Pointing Device  Reverse Scrolling Direction Select "Reverse Vertical Scrolling"  From here, use Apple  System Preferences  Mouse (or touchpad) and select "natural scrolling"   <answer259045> Both Karabiner and Scroll Reverse do not work on Sierra so far (October 2016). I use a logitech M185 and the app from Logitech instead (http://support.logitech.com/en_us/product/wireless-mouse-m185) and it works. Now I can separate the scroll direction between the trackpad and the mouse.  <answer259505> Based on Tien answer, I tried to find some Logitech software that could help me. I have a Anywhere MX 2 mouse and the codeLogitech Options/code software really "fix" this problem for me! It can be downloaded here:  http://support.logitech.com/pt_br/software/options  Here is how I set it:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Xt5Lc.png" alt="Logitech Options with &#39;Standard&#39; scroll direction"  Having scroll direction: standard here and natural scrolling on macOS Sierra settings make it work as it makes sense: natural scrolling on trackpad (two thingers up scrolls down) and standard scrolling on the wheel (roll the wheel "back" scrolls down).  Hope it helps!  <answer262661> This little app solved my trouble. Works like a charm. https://pilotmoon.com/scrollreverser/  <answer268530> As Tien posted, Logitech now has an app with the option to separate trackpad and mouse scroll directions, but this only works with a unifying receiver or Bluetooth. I have a wonderful Logitech VX Nano that I donâ€™t intend to give up on, which pre-dates unifying receiver.  And Karabiner or Scroll Reverse do not currently work on Sierra.  Instead you can use the free app Reverse Scrolling, which works on Sierra.  https://pilotmoon.com/scrollreverser/ img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6uxsZ.png" alt="Scroll Reverser"  <comment174162> It's possible that they just don't get it, since I'd be willing to bet practically no one at Apple actually uses mice with physically scrolling wheels.  (That would be like using a Mac at Microsoft: anathema to management.)  For someone who didn't give it much thought it might seem to make sense, but if you use all three devices (iOS devices, Apple mice or trackpads, and wheel mice) you quickly realize Apple's decision was a horrible one. <comment205713> To elaborate on this process, run the `Karabiner` app, which opens the customization UI. Then go to the "Misc & Uninstall" tab at the top. There are buttons on this page to "Open private.xml" and "Open EventViewer" which you can use to get the product ID and edit the XML as shown above. <comment220719> "This is intentional" is just Apple's way of avoiding that it admitted it did something wrong. For all of Apple's supposed attention to detail, small usability problems like this are quite ubiquitous in OSX. <comment227921> Some more details - Replace both occurrences of "SOMEVENDOR" with an arbitrary single word representing your manufacturer (e.g. Microsoft). Replace both occurrences of "PRODUCTNAME" with an arbitrary single word representing your mouse (e.g. MicrosoftSculpt). Replace 0x1234 with the string from "Vendor ID" column in event viewer. Replace 0x0001 with the string from "Product ID" column in event view. Save the xml and hit "Change Key  Reload XML". Make sure to enable the OSX "Scroll direction: natural" in the mouse configuration. <comment236089> Nice!  One less utility to launch & have in the background. <comment254891> Karabiner is awesome. <comment259375> Scroll reverser doesn't work reliably after waking up from sleep... <comment259376> @binaryanomaly works perfectly to me, do you mind sharing your configuration? hardware/osx version/ scroll reverser version <comment259391> MacBook Pro 2015 with El Capitan, v 1.7.2. The issue is also mentioned on the developer's site in the FAQ section http://pilotmoon.com/scrollreverser/ <comment259393> @binaryanomaly then try with Karabiner as the other answer suggested <comment259787> Actually in El Capitan you can administrate the settings for mouse and trackpad independently in System Preferences. So no need for 3rd party tools anymore :) <comment261064> @binaryanomaly I checked and the "scroll direction: natural" on Mouse settings still affects the trackpad. El Capitan 10.11.1 <comment261232> Unfortunately you're right - it's two places for 1 setting :( weird. Back to Karabiner for now. <comment265024> Hi. I don't seem to be seing "Don't remap Apple's pointing devices" under System Preferences  General after installing Karabiner. <comment269582> Rather than say "the answer above" it is better to specify *whose* answer you are referring to.  Whether an answer is "above" or not depends on how users sort the answers, and even that changes over time.  Also, new answers are added, so directional references become more and more confusing, even if they seemed relatively clear at first. <comment275815> Search for the phrase "remap" -- it's there. <comment278792> Karabiner worked for me on El Capitan where Scroll Reverser didn't. <comment281058> For step-by-step instructions: http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/230241/85983 <comment281199> This solution doesn't work for the Apple Magic Mouse, which makes sense since both the trackpad and magic mouse are both Apple devices. I was unable to find a way to make the settings such that it would remap one but not the other <comment289196> NB: in the current version of Karabiner (10.18.0 in any event), the first setting has been renamed to "Don't remap Apple's pointing devices". <comment297954> Edited answer to show correct config mapping to get to the remap option:  * Karabiner core settings  Exclude devices  Don't remap Apple's pointing devices <comment300193> I've the same issue <comment316209> So this no longer works in Sierra. Anyone found a working solution in the meantime? <comment322985> Hopefully people will check here with problems after updating to OS X Sierra. My system would freeze up after a random amount of time. First the mouse would become unresponsive and within a couple of minutes the system would totally freeze.   This happened after the OSX update and was resolved by disabling the ScrollReverser app. <comment322987> @RoyPrins thanks for the warning, I added it to my answer <comment324612> does this feature not exist in Karabiner-Elements? <comment324670> what software from logitech? <comment324671> answering myself on a "answer" below ;) <comment324821> I don't see these options on Mac OS X 10.12.1. I have a Unifying Mouse, but I cannot add it to the Logitech Options. I guess that needs to be done before I can modify its options? <comment325804> @RoyPrins a new version of Scroll Reverser has been released <comment326321> You just need to install `Logitech Options` Logitech software. <comment326498> @GuidoPreite It appears that I have falsely blamed Scroll Reverser in my previous comment though. The problems did *not* disappear with the removal of Scroll Reverser. They did however go away after updating the Logitech Control Center. Sorry for spreading wrong information and I hope you would take the trouble to update your answer yet again. <comment326521> @RoyPrins thanks for your additional tests, I updated my answer <comment326591> @iconoclast: No, in Karabiner Elements you can only remap keys. But the Logitec app works pretty well. <comment329061> Hi welcome to AskDifferent, I find if a question is worth answering it is worth upvoting.  Also some instructions rather than just a link may get you more upvotes and make your answer more "future" proof. Please take the time to read the Answer and Question section of the [help](http://apple.stackexchange.com/help) page. <comment332980> Apparently, it only works with wireless mice. <comment335380> Related question: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/17966/how-can-i-set-a-different-scrolling-direction-for-mouse-and-trackpad-in-lion I have two answers there, both updated for Sierra <comment335829> This only works for Logitech mice with a unifying receiver or bluetooth. My Logitech VX Nano has a pre-unifying RF receiver. <comment336721> To the top you go.. <comment337286> I've just tried Scroll Reverser on my MacBook Pro running Mac OS Sierra, and it works perfectly. <comment344916> `Logitech Options` only works with some Logitech mice. Even if you have a unifying mouse, it's not a guarantee to be supported. <comment346599> in El Capitan... Karabiner DOES NOT reverse scroll direction SEPARATELY from the trackpad -- confirmed 2017-03-05 <comment346601> they need to get UNTIRED of hearing it -- when so many people have this issue, it's a REAL issue -- with the end of Steve Jobs so ends the quality of Apple... <comment346603> THIS answer is accurate and correct for me on El Capitan 2017-03-05 -- whereas ALL OTHER answers i read prior to this did not provide the critical two-setting explanation -- therefore i consider "the answer above" and "all the other answers" wrong... and "THIS answer" right <comment354827> Karabiner doesn't work with Sierra. They recommend using Karabiner-Elements instead, but that one doesn't seem to offer this option.  So Karabiner is no longer a solution. <comment354828> Confirmed!  Works great on Sierra. Karabiner or Scroll Reverse do not currently work on Sierra, so this is the only solution of the ones currently listed that works. <comment356333> Works on Sierra! What a lifesaver! <comment359408> In this case @Deesbek there really doesn't seem to be any point to elaborate. It really does work like a charm. If you go to the site and download the app it reverses the scrolls (separately for mouse and trackpad, the whole point of the question). Also, F Apple for claiming this is an intentional decision. That's just lazy.
