Reason why applications aren't stored in the Home-Folder? <body> strongI wonder why Apple don't put all applications in an applications folder inside the Home-Folder./strong So they could offer a hole new mac for each user.   Every file is user specific, except for the applications. Is there a reason for this? Or just "too complicated" because every user want to have access to Safari and Third-Party Apps?      Is it just Apple or is it a UNIX design decision?   Is there an explanation/documentation/ operation system design?   <answer89071> Apple's design is not at all a traditional or typical UNIX layout for user files, user preferences or application files and preferences so I would say this is just Apple.  They do document exactly how developers are supposed to design OS X apps to take advantage of the "canonical" locations where files and preferences should be stored so that each user can decide to install any application in one or several locations.  ul li/Applications/li li/Another volume/Aplications/li li~/Applications/li lior anywhere else on the drive since on OS X - you don't need to place an application anywhere as long as the user can read from the folder - an app should run and store things in the proper pace (which is NOT in the application folder itself)./li /ul  Here are three articles I would start with to learn more:  ul liOS X File System Programming Guide/li liOS X File System Details/li liApple OS File System Overview (iOS and OS X combined) strongemStart Here/em/strong and emskip past the iOS part/em and go directly to Table 1-2 for OS X summary of important folders./li /ul  <answer89125> Not that long ago, the system came set up with an Applications folder in the Home Directory. I continue to keep one and recommend the practice for decluttering the main Applications folder of smaller and seldom-used apps.  <comment104443> If you just install all applications in a folder called Applications for each user - they can have their own copy of each and every third party application. I assume you are asking why Apple put Safari and other system apps that are delivered with OS X in /Applications rather than hiding it and hard linking each app to the home folder of each new user when you make them an account? (i.e. - what problem are you trying to solve here other than researching why a decision was made?) <comment104450> Actually no problems... i just wonder why. There is this great opportunity to separate each user and then they creat a "public" applications folder <comment104467> Join us in [chat] for any general discussions as well as questions that basically ask "why" - we close them as off topic on the main site since they end up not being useful when viewed in the definition of what we want Stack Exchange / Ask Different to be. <comment104523> With a setup like that, how do you solve the problem of several users wanting to use the same apps? <comment104608> Users have access to /Applications. They can also have aliases galore in ~/Applications. But all Apple apps do want to live in /Applications, that's where updaters will look.
