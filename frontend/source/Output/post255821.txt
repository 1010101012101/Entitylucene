Get Color Sidebar Icons Back in Mac OS finder Window <body> Suppose I want to come back to Color sidebar icon for Finder. For Lion I followed these instructions, but seems not working anymore (SIMBL is not working with Sierra):   http://osxdaily.com/2011/08/25/get-color-sidebar-icons-back-in-mac-os-x-10-7-lion-finder-windows/  So, do you know if there is a way to change from this fantastic soviet union gray sidebar to one with color?   thanks, Andrea  <answer264247> Use mySIMBL* instead, SIMBL has been non-functional since apple implemented System Integrity Protection. Once you've set up mySIMBL install the package at:  Sources  Wolf's tweaks  colorfulSidebar9.  Then restart Finder and you should have colored sidebar icons again.  * I am the developer of mySIMBL and colorfulSidebar9  <comment318787> You would need to modify system resources, which requires disabling SIP at the very least. <comment331095> Good solution! However you should disclose your affiliation with the package in your answer â€” just on principle, but it's also a [rule](http://apple.stackexchange.com/help/behavior). (even though it's open source and free) :) <comment332878> How is colorfulSidebar9 different from ColorfulSidebar from the following website? http://cooviewerzoom.web.fc2.com/colorfulsidebar.html <comment332901> colorfulSidebar9 works on 10.9+ <comment350038> I installed mySIMBL, and it disabled my open/save file panel resources, so I had to remove it from Sierra Launch Agents, etc. Any other option? I miss the color sidebar...
