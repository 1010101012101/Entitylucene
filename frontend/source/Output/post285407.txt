Macintosh HD volume reduced after error during Bootcamp Partition <body> I was creating a new partition with bootcamp assistant, when this screen came up: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9q3nE.png" alt="your computer restarted because of a problem"  When the computer was on again, I checked my disk utility and the Macintosh HD disk was smaller (180gb instead of 250gb) and there is no new partition. So 70gb of my volume has gone somewhere, and I don't know how to restore it since there was no extra partition created. The capacity still shows it's a 250gb disk, but the Macintosh HD partition is just 180gb.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zugq2.png" alt="Here&#39;s a screenshot of my disk utility"  I tried first aid in recovery mode, and repairing disk from single user mode, but nothing changed. Any ideas what could I do? Hope someone can help me out.
