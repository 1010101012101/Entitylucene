Fixed it by following the path to Python/frameworks.  The folder in Versions was named 2.7.  I changed the folder name to 2.6 and iPhoto opened right up.  <comment93409> Have you removed or otherwise tampered with the Python libraries? <comment93417> @jaberg I removed the one that came installed with OSX, and replaced it with the latest version from the official python website. <comment93418> Seems iPhoto is looking for a missing library
