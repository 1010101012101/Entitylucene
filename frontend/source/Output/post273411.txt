After update to Sierra 10.12.3 keyboard malfunctions like the alt key was stuck, but it's a software error <body> Since I upgraded to Sierra 10.12.3 this week I ran into a strange keyboard error: The keyboard would act like the alt key was stuck, so it was all typing ~ø~‚€~‚€ (nonsense). I switched keyboards, but the problem persisted. I rebooted and the problem was gone only to come back after a couple of minutes.  I checked all the accessiblity features, keyboard mappings, keyboard settings, killed every program that does anything remotely to typing-manipulation, but nothing helped.  Interestingly enough, the problem goes away by bringing up the remote login screen via vnc on another machine (I didn't even have to login, for this "fix" to work), but the alt-stuck error always comes back after a couple of minutes.  I think I narrowed it down to the xquartz engine. I did a lot of vector work in inkscape that week. But it is not xquartz starting/running that causes the effect, but something done inside quartz.  Has anybody else experienced this? Any ideas on how to fix it, except swapping inkscape for affinity (which I already did)?  <comment343745> When you type asdfg, do you get åß∂ƒ©  ? <comment343746> Have you tried a Safe Boot?  Or setting up a new user account and seeing if you have the same problem when logged into that?  Or resetting NVRAM/PRAM?
