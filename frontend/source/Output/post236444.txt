It can be found in the AppleStore.  I have been using it for over a year, very pleased with it.  <answer248789> I use Sunrise and it's great, you can add your Google Account and the GUI is very similar.  <comment308400> Sunrise is shutting down: http://blog.sunrise.am/post/144196642739/its-almost-time-to-say-goodbye <comment314862> now shut down, as of today after an extension :( :( <comment315259> Sunrise was the best calendar app ever.
