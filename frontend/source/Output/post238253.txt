Screen Brightness keeps automatically adjusting to 100% <body> I have a late 2011 Mac book Pro, which I have kept in mint condition. Recently, my brightness has kept adjusting itself to full 100% brightness on the display, and keeps adjusting itself every few minutes even if it's still at 100% brightness. I have tried un-checking the automatically adjust brightness option and I still haven't been able to stop this from happening. Please help!!!!  <answer238283> Since you have already un-checked the "Auto-adjust Brightness" option in the display settings, try resetting the System Management Controller (SMC). This may resolve the issues related to power management. Follow these guidelines to reset the SMC. One of the indicators that your SMC might need to be reset:      The display backlight doesn't respond correctly to ambient light   changes on Mac computers that have this feature.
