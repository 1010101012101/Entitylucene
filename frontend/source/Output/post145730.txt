How do I disable "Enable Autofill using Contacts..."? <body> I get this notification on forms in Google Chrome. What is prompting it and how do I turn it off?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6xT7U.png" alt="screenshot of notification"  I searched through Chrome's settings but the only part that appeared to be relevant was unchecked:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zCL9n.png" alt="Chrome settings shot"  So I'm thinking this might be a system setting, even though it has only appeared recently?  <answer145747> This appears to be a bug. A solution online recommends     ol   liGo to a form such as the USPS ZIP lookup/li   liStart to fill it, and click "enable autofill" when it appears./li   liIf prompted for permissions to let Chrome use contacts, do not allow it./li   /ol   Just clicking the enable autofill once appeared to do the trick for meâ€”I think my Chrome was already blocked from my contacts.  <comment171771> Could you elaborate bit more, what have you tried, did you check your Chrome settings, what Version of Chrome, on what hardware, what OSX ect...
