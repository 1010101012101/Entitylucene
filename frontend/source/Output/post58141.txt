Disable saving to iCloud in Mountain Lion <body> Mountain Lion introduced a feature where you can save your documents to iCloud instead of local storage.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Mh3fF.png" alt="enter image description here"  I don't ever see myself using it, is there a way to disable this (but I strongdon't/strong want to disable iCloud entirely)?  <answer58142> Actually I found there's a switch in emSystem Preferences  iCloud  Documents &amp; Data/em  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/e8Igv.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer105233> If you don't want to uncheck Documents &amp; Data from System Preferences, there is also an unexposed preference that disables showing the iCloud-centric open dialog when there are no open windows:  precodedefaults write -g NSShowAppCentricOpenPanelInsteadOfUntitledFile -bool false /code/pre  It makes TextEdit create an untitled document and Preview not open any window.  Unlike unchecking Documents &amp; Data, it does not disable using the iCloud-centric open dialog when you for example press command-O.  <comment142795> In Mavericks, in the dialog shown above, next to Documents & data there is a button marked Options which allows you to disable TextEdit only from iCloud. Hooray!
