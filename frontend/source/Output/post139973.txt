iPhone 5 no phone services <body> I am unable to dial out receive calls or text messages.   How can I fix the problem?   I've tried shutting it down waiting awhile then turning it back on and the phone still shows "searching".  <answer139998> If you have no phone service check following:  ul liDisable Airplane mode (if it is enabled)/li liCheck that your SIM card is inserted properly./li liCheck if you see your phone service provider name./li /ul  <comment164940> You may have turned on Airplane Mode (http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1355) by accident. Go to Settings to check.
