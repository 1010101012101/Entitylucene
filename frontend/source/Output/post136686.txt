How to choose which connection to use for SSH <body> I have an ethernet connection which is restricted for a lot of ports (the most annyoing is port 22 -ssh- ).  I now have a Wifi connection which is unrestricted.  I want to tell to my mac, strongeach time i use the port 22 via the terminal, to use the WIFI and in the other case, to use the Ethernet connexion/strong.  Is there a way to do this ?
