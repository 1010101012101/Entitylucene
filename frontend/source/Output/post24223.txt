Useful Chrome extensions for OS X <body> I know there is already a post out there for Safari extensions, but Chrome extensions are completely different. So, what extensions do you think are useful? Please read these simple rules before posting:  ul liInclude only one extension in each anwer./li liInclude a description of the extension, its pros/cons, and why you use it./li liLink to the developer's website, rather than a direct download page. /li liCite the application name like such:br code#appName by [developer]/code/li liCheck to see if there are duplicates in this post by typing in the search box:br codeinquestion:this searchTerm/code/li liPlease do not give a price because that can localize your answer too much./li /ul  <answer24232> h1AdBlock by chromeadblock.com/h1  (The listed developer link just circles back to the extension URL.)

Think Safari's Bonjour collection but awesomer, geekier emand/em in a decent browser.  <comment27109> Please make sure you follow the formatting rules. I edited your answer to change the formatting. <comment27110> I threw in an edit too to add the developer site (found it after I posted). Not sure if the edits conflicted or not. <comment27111> I don't have edit privileges, so the edits probably didn't. <comment29694> This is off topic davieageek. Unfortunately Chrome is a cross-platform browser and it's extensions work on every version of Chrome, from OS X to Windows. There are no specific extensions that only run on the OS X version of Chrome. <comment29695> @cksum Well, it's been around for quite a while, and it hasn't been closed, so... It is a question about software, but we'll see. I understand what you're saying. <comment29698> I'm willing to let this fly. @cksum is right that this isn't Mac OS X specific, but then neither is Safari these days. <comment29699> Alright guys. No disrespect daviesgeek. Safari might still be considered Apple specific if for nothing else than it is developed by Apple (unlike Chrome which really has no connection). <comment29700> @cksum: It was a fair flag. The use of community wiki is changing and you brought up a valid point. But since this has already gained some traction by the time you noticed it, I think it can stay. <comment29701> Understood Philip. And again, not wanting to ruffle feathers. <comment32740> Can all the extra stuff above be removed? (including this comment) <comment33455> Chrome now has this feature built in. To use it, go to `about:flags` and enable **Click to play**. Then set **Preferences** - **Under the Bonnet** - **Plug-ins** to the newly appeared **Click to play** option. <comment43379> Pretty cool! I like the "decent browser" part. :-) <comment43380> @daviesgeek don't get me started! I used to like Safari pre-Lion... <comment43381> I don't like Safari (period). <comment43382> Sweet plugin! Installed forever and ever...
