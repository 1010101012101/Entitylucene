Imessaging when travelling and not using cellular <body> I would like to know whether iMessages will revert to text messages when I travel overseas and have my cellular set to "off when roaming". I normally use SMS or MMS to keep in touch when travelling.   <answer273460> Providing you have codeSettings &gt; Messages &gt; Send as SMS/code toggled on and codeSettings &gt; Mobile Data &gt; Mobile Data Options &gt; Data Roaming/code toggled off then yes, messages sent from the Messages app will go as SMS.  <comment343834> "Blue" messages will work, "green" will not.
