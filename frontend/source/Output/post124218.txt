Why won't Time Machine restore my files? <body> I replaced the hard drive in my iMac after making a time machine backup of the old drive. I've installed Mavericks on the new drive and booted with it. The old drive (time machine) is connected via USB. When I boot into recovery, and select "Restore from Time Machine" my new disk becomes unbootable.  Luckily, it appears that time machine also made an automatic backup of the new drive when I was booted with it for awhile as there are two TM instances to choose from on the USB drive now. Restoring the latest one restores my boot drive. No luck with Migration Assistant either. It spins for about 10 seconds and then just says "Migration Complete" but nothing is actually copied over. I've also tried using rsync to simply copy from the old "/Applications/"  to the new disk "/Applications/" but when I click the icon which appears in the Applications dock item, a dialog just says em"You can't open the application "Xcode5-DP3" because it may be damanged or incomplete"/em   My question is: is there any other way to restore things like Xcode, Keychain, Thunderbird, Firefox, etc along with all my desktop settings? One note I should make is that I installed Macports on my old system and that user id ended up being 501. My new id on the new disk is 502. I don't know if that makes a difference or not?  <comment145199> What about having the OS be reinstalled and then going through the Setup Assistant to transfer files instead of the Recovery Partition? <comment145252> After reinstalling, Setup Assistant said it moved files from my old "system" partition, however after a reboot nothing appears to have changed on the new disk. Strange because it worked for about 30 minutes seemingly transferring files. /Applications is still "stock" and nothing appears to be copied from my old /Users/username directory. Some of the icons in the Dock are now big questions marks though. sheesh.
