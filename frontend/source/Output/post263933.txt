Troubleshooting missing photos in icloud.com <body> I recently enabled iCloud Photo Library on my iPhone. Just underneath the toggle, it said it was uploading the 2 live photos I've taken. Then, it said it finished uploading. When I go to icloud.com and look at the photos, there is nothing there.  Things I've checked already:  ul liThe Apple id logged into iCloud is the same Apple id logged into icloud.com on my computer/li liThe photos on my iPhone are not hidden. Or deleted./li liI waited overnight to let the servers catch up. Still nothing./li liThe page at https://www.icloud.com/#settings says I'm using 8.35 MB on photos and videos (but nothing at all shows up at https://www.icloud.com/#photos )/li liI've logged out of icloud.com on the web, and back in./li liThere are only two live photos on my iPhone, nothing else. (There is a 3rd live photo in the trash.) No still photos or videos have been taken./li /ul  What can I do to try to force it to "reset"? Any other troubleshooting ideas?  <comment330694> I have a 2nd iPhone, which is signed into icloud, but it is set to NOT use iCloud photo library. <comment330699> Take a look at [this Q&A stream](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/219814/88313).  Some people mention they can see the uploaded photos immediately while others say they need to wait a day or so. <comment330970> It's been about 48 hours since I turned on iCloud photos. Still nothing.
