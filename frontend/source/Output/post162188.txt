iPhone 3GS lost and canâ€™t use Find my iPhone <body> My iPhone 3GS was lost and I don't have any iOS device to login and erase the data.   I logged in using the browser on my Windows PC but it says I need an iOS device to locate my phone. Can I erase the data I have in the phone in any other way?  <answer162189> You can use any browser to go to https://www.icloud.com/#find &amp; track the phone, play sound, erase it or lock it - so long as you know your AppleID &amp; password.  If not, start at iforgot.apple.com  <comment189574> i did login and clicked find my iphone.But it says i need a iphone or mac and setup icloud account to use find my iphone <comment189578> You need to log into your *existing* iCloud account, the one you used to register the phone. <comment189580> i did.Is there any requirement of setting up find my iphone or is it built in? <comment189581> You have to have switched it on, on the phone <comment189584> The big question is did you enable Find My iPhone on the device *before* it was lost?
