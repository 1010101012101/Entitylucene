Can cell provider disable GPS on iPhone 5s? <body> After I arrived in a small village in Spain, my iPhone 5 would always be "Searching" but never find a cell tower.  Movistar, which I have is allegedly the best coverage in Spain, but I have roaming enabled and it doesn't find any other.  After I had been here about a week, I went for a country trek and tried to use GPS.  iPhone could not get a fix in ten minutes or more.  It strongdid/strong work when I arrived (I tracked my route to get here) with the cell off (airplane mode).  I was standing in the open waiting for it to get a fix which it never did though a Garmin I had with me had acquired more than ten satellites, five with max power.  Later, I realized that my pre-pay service had probably run out.  Is it possible for a cell provider to prevent GPS from working?  Bluetooth and WiFi still work, and location services is on.  Many GPS apps will complain if GPS is turned off--none did.  This is a GSM device with the latest updates.  <comment289291> My pre-pay has not run out.  It is for thirty days, and I have only been in Spain for 22 days.  Also, I see in Settings-Cellular that it says my statistics last reset is "Never" which is not true.  I reset them every time I buy a new data package, including the current one about twenty days ago.  So I am suspecting the phone may be getting ready to die of old age.  (Or get Alzheimer's) <comment298492> Now confirmedâ€”the phone is definitely broken. http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/242148/iphone-cannot-update-nor-activate-broken
