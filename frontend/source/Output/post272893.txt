PDF page manipulation, from 2 page per sheet to one page per sheet <body> I have a PDF with following pattern:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ndfoj.png" alt="enter image description here"  I need to transform each page of this PDF into two distinct pages, as follows:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/k3Ro5.png" alt="enter image description here"  and   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eav4e.png" alt="enter image description here"  So, if I had a PDF with 12 pages (2 slides for each page) I will expect a new PDF with 24 pages (1 slide for each page).  How do I can do that?  <answer272898> Open your pdf in Preview.app. Click the toolbox icon. Click the Rectangular-Select icon. Select one of the pages. Copy it. Click File  New from clipboard. Save that file. Repeat. Now you have Untitled1 through Untitled24. Open Untitled1 in Preview. Click the menu just under the red x and choose "Thumbnails."  Drag all the files Untitled2-24 just under Untitled1 in the sidebar. Save as a pdf.  <comment343024> This solved the problem I asked. Thank you. But I haven't specified how to have an "automated" mechanism to do that: how much time I will have to spent to transform 9 documents having between 24 รท 87 pages? <comment343157> You may be able to automate the process with Briss. http://briss.sourceforge.net. It's what I use for problems such as yours, when I scan a book open faced and then want it in single pages. Sorry for not mentioning it the first time.
