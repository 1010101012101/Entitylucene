OSX: modifying text selection with ⌘⇧→ and ⌘⇧← <body> I've selected some text using my keyboard, starting at the bottom line and moving up (the strong|/strong character indicates the cursor position):     AAA strong|{BBB CCC/strong      strongDDD}/strong EEE FFF   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mnRhb.gif" alt="create selection"  hr  Now, I would like to emchange the selection so that it starts at the end of the first line/em, i.e. so that it looks like this:  strongExpected result:/strong     AAA BBB CCC strong|{/strong      strongDDD}/strong EEE FFF   hr  I can reduce the selection word-by-word with kbd⌥/kbd kbd⇧/kbd kbd→/kbd:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FqrsY.gif" alt="manipulate selection with option-shift-arrows"  hr  But the natural way to do it would be via kbd⌘/kbd kbd⇧/kbd kbd→/kbd, to jump directly to the end of the first line. In many decent text editors this works fine (for instance Sublime Text 2). They also keep the code|/code position visible when text is selected btw.  strongThe default behaviour of OSX apps, however, is that they ignore the fact that the cursor is currently at the start of the selection, and moving it to the right should remove the selection there./strong Instead,  kbd⌘/kbd kbd⇧/kbdkbd→/kbd always extends the selection from its end until the end of the line, no matter where the cursor currently is:  strongActual result:/strong     AAA strong{BBB CCC/strong      strongDDD EEE FFF}|/strong   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1ucMd.gif" alt="manipulate selection with command-shift-arrows"  hr  Is there any way to make also native OSX apps behave the expected way?  I'm on OSX Yosemite 10.10.2 but I think this issue has been there as long as I can remember.  <answer172091> Mac doesn't use the cursor position if you have a multiple text selection, it considers the cursor is at 'all selected text'.   You can see this demonstrated if you use kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd Shift ⇧ /kbd kbd ← /kbd instead of kbd → /kbdbr Adding to the selection with kbd Shift ⇧ /kbd includes the previous selection.  Not a fix, but a workaround might be kbd → /kbd which would move the cursor to the end of your current selection, simultaneously deselecting it, then kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd Shift ⇧ /kbd kbd ← /kbd  to select to the beginning of the line.  <answer172094> So, the way I see it, text navigation on OS X works (and is expected to work) like this:  ol liNavigate per line (or document, i.e. huge chunks of data):  kbdcmd/kbd+arrow keys : moves by lines (left/right for lines, up/down for the whole document). Hold kbdshift/kbd to select/li liNavigate per word (i.e. small chunks of data):  kbdalt/kbd+arrow keys : moves by word (left/right). Hold kbdshift/kbd to select./li /ol  So to achieve your "expected result" you should press the right arrow first to get it to the end of your current selection and then kbdcmd/kbd+kbdshift/kbd+kbd ← /kbd to select the line leading up to it.  When you already emhave/em a selection:   ol liusing the kbdalt/kbd key combo's above will increase/decrease the selection based on direction (always modifying the end-point of your previous selection, presuming emthat you've missed the end point slightly/em). Same goes for adding single characters with shift+arrow keys only./li lithe kbdcmd/kbd combo's increase in both directions, presuming you're after emselecting big chunks of text/em anyway./li /ol  hr  h2Update/h2  Long story short: what you want isn't really possible. If you look at the list of available system key bindings by running  precodeplutil -convert xml1 /System/Library/Frameworks/AppKit.framework/Resources/StandardKeyBinding.dict -o -|pl|grep -v noop:|ruby -pe '$_.gsub!(/[^ -~\n]/)' | grep -i selection /code/pre  You'll see that even though you can bind custom keys to all selection functions  code~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict/code  there is no such function that achieves your requested behaviour (since this behaviour is not built into the system).  <comment202523> I can reproduce this in 10.10.1—maybe it's been fixed in the beta? <comment202588> I'm on Yosemite 10.10.2 (also adding it to the question now). But I think this has always been the case. I primarily use code editors with good text editing capabilities, but I'd love to find an OS-level solution to this. <comment202600> I' also updated the question with some animated gifs to make it easier to understand what the issue is. <comment202680> Please have a look at [this Apple Support Document](http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201236) which states that cmd+shift+right arrow will `select text between the insertion point and the end of the current line`. The only line in your example, where the selection does _not already include the end of the line_, is the last line. So the _expected behaviour_ in OS X is to extend the selection from there, not to cut it short in the beginning line! I know that some Editors behave differently, but they are doing it _wrong_ not the system! <comment202701> @Asmus Thank your for the link. The default OSX behaviour does indeed adhere to what is documented on that page, so it's technically the correct one. My question still stands though – is it possible to change it globally, so that it behaves like it does in more advanced editors (and on Linux and Windows for that matter)? <comment202704> @Asmus There is a little asterisk after the description of that (and many other) keyboard shortcut but there's no explanation for it. Any idea what the `(*)` means? <comment202706> No idea what the `(*)` means, but it's probably left over from previous versions of the documentation. I've updated my answer slightly to include the global keybinding only option I know of, but unfortunately I'm pretty sure there's no way to achieve what you're looking for. Since the behaviour is not built-in, applications would not now how to handle it even if you could trigger it. <comment202711> Thanks, @Asmus. I've upvoted your answer. Will wait a bit before accepting it in case someone to come up some ingenious solution. <comment208474> What does this mean? "A multiple text selection". <comment208478> I think that Apple Up and Apple Down go to the beginning and end of the document, and do not navigate by page. <comment209891> @NicolasBarbulesco you're completely right, I had written "document" just  a line before, don't know why I wrote "pages" next. Fixed it now.
