How to get iTerm to properly send the CTRL-. sequence? <body> Emacs uses a lot of codeC-./code and similar keyboard sequences.  iTerm doesn't send the key sequence codeC-./code itself, but I've found that I can map codeC-./code into an escape sequence or hex code or text in iTerm's preferences/profile/keys. How can I get iTerm to send codeC-./code as something that Emacs will recognize?  <answer219833> You can view Emacs' key bindings by typing codeC-h, b/code. If you then search the help text for codeC-./code you'll find this mapping:  precodeM-[ 2 7 ; 5 ; 4 6 ~ C-. /code/pre  The codeESC [ â€¦ ~/code sequence is used to send arbitrary key combinations numerically, primarily for combinations that don't map to a specific character. Since Control-Period doesn't map to a character that can be sent to a terminal, map it to the character sequence codeESC [ 2 7 ; 5 ; 4 6 ~/code (without the spaces).  The second parameter in the escape sequence is a number representing the modifier keys and the third parameter is the base character. The modifier-key values are described at the end of the emPC-Style Function Keys/em section of the XTerm Control Sequences documentation.
