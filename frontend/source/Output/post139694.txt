How can I correct/delete iOS holidays on iDevice <body> I discovered a number of strange entries in iCal on my iDevices which I didn't enter, and also were just on this device and neither my Mac nor the other device.  After a little search I found that my iPhone has a calendar for German holidays and the iPad a calendar for Swiss holidays. This is rather strange as I live in Austria and haven't visited these countries since the time I got these devices (2 years). These calendars are in the section where also birthdays are and can not be edited or deleted. They also don't show up on iCal on the mac. I also checked the timezone on the devices - but this is set to Vienna - Austria.  So how would I fix them to Austrian holidays? - or at least delete so I won't be irritated by them.  <answer139706> AFAIK, you cannot delete the Holiday Calender on your iOS device. However, you can hide it via Calender app. In the Calendar app, tap Calendars in the bottom center and uncheck the Holiday calendar. And, here's how you can add Austrian holidays to your iPhone and iPad calender:  ol liGo to Settings - Mail, Contacts, Calendars/li liNow, tap on Add Account/li liScroll down and tap on Other/li liTap on “Add Subscribed Calendar”/li liType in “http://laudatio.com/florian/ical/AustrianHolidays.ics” and press strong“Next”/strong, and then press “strongSave”/strong/li liPress strong"Done"/strong. Congrats, you've added Austrian Holidays to your calendar./li /ol  You might find this useful: http://www.igeeksblog.com/how-to-add-us-holidays-to-iphone-calendar/ Hope it helps!

If that doesn't help after change, force close calendar after region change n check again.  Eg. If ur calendar is showing US holiday's, and u want UK holidays, your region in 'language &amp; region' should be set to 'United Kingdom'  <comment164739> Well guess that's how it is. But I think it strange that they messed up such a simple feature. Will drop apple support a note - but they don't make it easy :)
