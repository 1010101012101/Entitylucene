iCloud Family note data won't sync between Mac and iPhone? <body> My wife and I have an iCloud account and then we have setup family account under these.  On our phones/tablets we use our own personal family account.  Now I want to be able to sync my Notes from my iPhone back to my Mac.  On the Mac I can see both the main account and my Parent/Guardian sub-account that I use for my iPhone.  When I open the Notes app on the Mac though, none of the data from my iPhone Notes is syncing.  I have checked the iPhone and Mac iCloud settings and both are set to sync notes for this account.  The family account displays within Notes, but none of my notes from the phone show up.  If I login to iCloud through the web and can see all of my notes are there on the web interface as well.
