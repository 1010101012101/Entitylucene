How to map function key (F1-F12) to perform like they do with builtin keyboard on Macbook <body> I have an USB external keyboard but the Fn(1-12) keys are kinda useless. I use my macbook in clamshell mode and I want to use the regular function like expose, etc.. using function keys.  Is this possibile with os x sierra?  <answer267573> I recommend using the free tool Karabiner-Elements to accomplish this. After you've installed it, go to the Function Keys tab and set each key's behavior as desired. Below is a replica of the default key behaviors on a 2014 MacBook Pro, for example. If you want to only remap the function keys on your external keyboard, then uncheck the internal keyboard in the Devices tab.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6jDjU.png" alt="Karabiner-Elements Preferences"  <comment330971> Have you tried System Prefs  Keyboard  Keyboard  Use all F1, F2 etc as standard function keys ? <comment331056> See this answer: http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/202122/28424 <comment331116> @ecnepsnai what i want is eg. press f8 on external usb keyboard to play/pause. That option isn't exactly what i want. <comment335828> Just what i need. Accepted. Thanks.
