IPhone 6s Plus why an external camera like FLiR no longer charges the phone after interaction dialog? <body> I got an external camera attachment for iPhone and it has an external power input. My understanding is that the camera is a part of an MFi (made for iPhone) - a certified accessory.  According to the manufacturer, it is supposed to charge phone when the camera receives external power:  ol liI plug in the camera, the charging symbol appears/li liThe strongcamera pops up a dialog/strong asking to interact with a default program/li liCharging symbol disappears and does not come back/li liI can confirm that the phone does not receive power - it discharges when the camera is attached./li /ol  I called the manufacturer and the camera is not defective - it has something to do with new iOS- I tried 9.0 and 9.2  strongIs there something new about MFi (made for iPhone) program that prevents external devices from charging the phone?/strong Is there a way to prevent the phone from creating an interaction dialog for that particular app?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0zyRq.png" alt="enter image description here"  I verified that the accessory is MFi compatible: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jzI2Q.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer225952> Check to make sure there's not any lint buildup in the Lightning port. Get a wooden or plastic toothpick (do emnot/em use anything metallic) and clean the port out, swiping from one edge to the other, then pulling out any bunched up lint or dust. Even a small amount of buildup will prevent the accessory from fully seating properly, sometimes generating a "This accessory is not supported" error, or simply preventing the device from charging, even when it has worked properly before.  <comment274311> Thanks, the port was indeed dirty, however, the issue appears on two different iPhones.
