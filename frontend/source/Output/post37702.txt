Change global system property for file.encoding <body> Due to a conflict between the mac osx lion 'file.encoding' system-property and my java application, i have to change the setting from MacRoman to UTF-8.  What is the best way to reset this system property globally for all users on this machine?  Regards mmm...  <answer37768> You've got it the wrong way round, the issue is not the OSX default encoding which is UTF8, but Java's default encoding under OSX which is MacRoman  Apples Mac Developer docs on Java see the section 'Character Encoding'  <comment42786> What is reading this property as I do not think java does? <comment42787> System.getProperties(); in java
