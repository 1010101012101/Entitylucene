What happens when interrupting a zip -erm process? <body> What happens if you interrupt following command   precode$ zip -erm foo foo/dirfoo1 /code/pre  I realized that time will not permit me to finish. What happens when I kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdC/kbd me out of this? Am I left with something that could be continued where it left off? If so, would that be as simple as re-running the command?br Or am I going to find what is not unzipped, and can I run the command for the "leftovers"?  <answer83068>    Am I left with something that could be continued where it left off   No. If you send a an Interrupt Unix Signal to codezip/code using kbdControl/kbd-kbdC/kbd, you'll terminate the codezip/code process and when you run it again it will start from the beginning, overwriting anything it already extracted.  If you instead send a emStop/em signal kbdControl/kbd-kbdZ/kbd, the codezip/code process will be paused, and you can resume it later using the codefg/code command.  Note that this will only work if you can maintain the state of your system. That is, if you sleep the system you'll be OK, but if you shutdown, then codezip/code will still be killed. Also, it assumes that the file codezip/code was working with remains available while it is stopped; that is, if it resides ona  network share which you dismount, sending a SIGSTOP will still not work.  <comment95730> why don't you try experimenting with it, and then post your results as your answer. <comment95736> that's exactly what I tried, 2min into the posting of my Q, but I had not enough "karma" to answer my own within such a short time interval ... zip process is volatile - i.e. crtl/c removes everything created temporarily. <comment95753> ^Z should work though
