Is there a way to limit OS X when searching for apps? <body> My issue is that OS X is finding multiple versions of applications. When opening a file with the "Open with ..." option, I see multiple versions of an app.  This is being caused by having multiple OS X partitions mounts. I'm not sure which process searches for apps, but I used the stronglsregister -dump/strong command to see that the database contains a version from each of my boot partitions.  Does anyone know what process does this? Is there a way to limit this process to certain partitions?  <answer178408> ol liOpen the Spotlight pane in System Preferences./li liSelect the Privacy tab./li liDrag the Applications folder from the partitions that you don't want indexed into the list area./li /ol  Shortly thereafter the duplicate results should disappear from the list, leaving applications from the one Applications folder you want.  You might need to force a refresh the LaunchServices database afterward too.  precode/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user /code/pre  Finally restart the Finder with the following command to rebuild any data cached within the Finder.  precodekillall Finder /code/pre  <comment211301> Outstanding, that worked perfectly. I tend to forget about the fancy GUI solutions as I spend too much time in the Terminal.
