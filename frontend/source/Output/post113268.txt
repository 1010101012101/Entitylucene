Quicktime screen recording creates a green movie <body> I tried creating a screencast on my OSX 10.8.5 MacBook pro, using QuickTime. This has worked before, but when I try it now I get:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GDHAA.png" alt="enter image description here"  The problem happens both on an external screen and on the retina display on the Mac. I've Googled the issue and tried installing gfxCardStatus, but it wouldn't work on my external monitor.  Any ideas how to fix this problem?  <answer113350> The (Ugly) solution that works is installing gfxCardStatus, Choosing "Integrated Only" and screencasting my laptop monitor without any external monitor.  It's is ugly indeed - will welcome any proper solution.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hXWmh.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment132924> Are you running 10.7 or 10.7.5, and what version of QuickTime? I am running 10.7.5, and QuickTime 10.1 and this functionality works fine. <comment132926> My bad, it's OSX 10.8.5, not 10.7. Quicktime version is 10.2 (603.17).
