is there free OS X equivalent to Total Commander? <body> is there strongfree/strong equivalent to Total Commander for OSX?  ul litwo panels/li lidrag &amp; drop /li litabs/li lietc ect/li /ul  I found DoubleCommander the best but OSX port has its bugs. muCommander is nice too but not as good as DoubleCommnader.  <answer9924> Path Finder or TotalFinder, perhaps?  (Both are commercial.)  <answer9956> TotalFinder became a commercial solution not long ago: the full beta development stage was free and gave me plenty of time to test the software. It's an excellent solution, and I have seen almost every single bug disappear progressively.  Even if not a free solution anymore, its source is available on GitHub. I would recommend it on the grounds that it already works wonderfully well, and definitely deserve some support in my (otherwise freeware-oriented) opinion.  If freeware is yet a compulsory feature for you, Geekosaur's link has a few options.  Edit, 2013-01-07: as mentioned in another answer, XtraFinder looks like TotalFinder, but free.  <answer76513> Try XtraFinder. Is like TotalFinder, but it's free  <answer84269> DCommander is a good alternative but it is not free. See http://www.devstorm-apps.com/dcommander-mac/ or itunes directly: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dcommander/id583622672?mt=12  <answer86025> I am satisfied with Forklift. Although it costs $20 after trial period, it is a simple yet powerful replacement of Finder/Total Commander.  What I value the most over other alternatives:   ul listrongSimple and clear UI/strong: power is under the hood/li liEasy switch between 1 or 2 panels (mostly I use only one)/li liOption to setup shortcuts: Enter to open file, backspace to move up/li liRegular Expression for filters/li liRenaming multiple files/li liSync folder: showing added/deleted/modified files/li liWebDav is much faster then in Finder/li /ul  See http://www.binarynights.com for all features and screenshot.   <answer92767> I'm writing an app similar to total commander, Mover - http://themaninhat.com/mover  <answer93720> You should probably take a look at Disk Order. It was created as a Total Commander equivalent for OS X. http://likemac.ru/english However it's not free either...  <answer101260> FastCommander supports all file operations. Fast, stable, small, lightweight.  Can be freely downloaded and used - no restrictions, just nag screen.  <comment10375> I totally forgot to mentioned that it must be free/open source <comment10376> http://alternativeto.net/software/double-commander/ lists some possibilities, but I suspect you've got the best you'll find. <comment88737> Can you provide, some additional information (e.g. a link and a short description)? <comment108810> It would be great if you could add some detail to your answer. <comment110193> see also http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/10097/what-orthodox-file-manager-for-os-x-could-i-use
