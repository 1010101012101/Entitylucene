/Library/Java - deleted it, how to restore? <body> I'm having problems with long shutdown times and I read somewhere that deleting code/Library/Java/code would solve it, so I did. It didn't do sh*t.  What was the content of that folder (a screenshot might help), and is there a way to restore it? (codesudo rm -r/code'd it, ftw)  <answer130640> On Mavericks  precodepse@Fourecks:~$ ll /Library/Java/ total 8 drwxrwxr-x  2 root  admin   68 Oct 23  2013 Extensions/ lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel   48 Oct 23  2013 Home@ -&gt; /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Home drwxr-xr-x  3 root  wheel  102 Oct 23  2013 JavaVirtualMachines/ pse@Fourecks:~$ ll /Library/Java/Extensions/ pse@Fourecks:~$ ll /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/ total 0 drwxrwxr-x  3 root  wheel  102 Jun 27  2012 1.7.0.jdk/ pse@Fourecks:~$ ll /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.7.0.jdk/Contents/ total 8 drwxrwxr-x  15 root  wheel   510 Jun 27  2012 Home/ -rw-rw-r--   1 root  wheel  1577 Jun 27  2012 Info.plist drwxrwxr-x   3 root  wheel   102 Aug  3  2012 MacOS/ /code/pre  So (as long as you don't need the JDK) you might fix this be redoing the symlink:  precodecd /Library/Java sudo ln -s /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Home . /code/pre  <comment153228> Please provide some more information. What OS and version are you on? Thx. <comment153235> Reinstall from oracle I think would work @chillin how does the OS version matter here as is not Apple software here just Oracle's (and note I suggest trying to reinstall I don't know if it will work) <comment153237> I'm on Mavericks 10.9.2. <comment153251> Do you think that I destroyed something by deleting `/Library/Java`? There is no `Home` folder at `System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/`, so I created one and symlinked it. Should I try and install jdk? <comment153276> You shouldn't need to *create* the home folder, just redo the symlink. For the JDK reinstalling should be enough. <comment154276> @WillB /Library/Java is Oracle's Java 7 or 8 /System/Library/Java is Apples's Java = 6
