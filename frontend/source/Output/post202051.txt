Apple headset not working in PC with Windows 10 <body> When I plug my Apple headset into my computer, it makes some very weird sounds. I've tried with two different headsets; both iPhone 4 headset and iPhone 5 headset.  It only makes the sounds when I'm playing some sounds on the computer, so I don't think it's a loose connection or something.  I have tried other headsets in the computer which works as they should. I cannot understand why Apple headsets should be different from other headsets? Could it be some driver problem which only happens when I use headsets with microphone? Or is it some mono/stereo problem?  I am using Windows 10.  <comment243680> windows 10 is not the problem, it is the headphone connector in your pc, apple uses a specific type of headphone jack that might not work with your computer, see this post for a more in dept explanation: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/135967/can-i-use-non-apple-headphones-with-an-iphone
