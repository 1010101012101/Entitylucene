Where are audio device files in OSX? <body> Probably because OSX uses different naming conventions for devices files and because OSX uses Core Audio audio subsystem (not ALSA or OSS) there are no devices such as:  code/dev/sdp/codebr / code/dev/audio/codebr / code/dev/mixer/codebr / code/dev/snd/*/codebr /  So, where are audio devices file in OSX?  <answer47836> According to the Mac OS X Developer Library:     The Audio family does not export device interfaces for applications to   access audio hardware directly. However, it does provide a device   interface that the Audio Hardware Abstraction Layer (Audio HAL) uses   to access drivers derived from the Audio family.   So I guess you need to find more information on "Audio HAL"  <answer47844> Here are some suggestions.  If you are talking about Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) devices, then the path is   precode/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/HAL/ /code/pre  By default there is one bundle there: on my Mac codeiSightAudio.driver/code, is the driver for the built-in webcam.  Other devices may use Kernel Extensions; bundles that end in code.kext/code, are located in:  precode/System/Library/Extensions/ /code/pre  <comment54795> Can you give some examples of the kinds of audio device files you wish to locate? Are you asking about Audio Unit, VST, or LADSPA files, for example? <comment54949> Or are you asking about drivers for specific hardware or peripherals? <comment54957> I've asked about device files for audio devices in OSX. I ment device files as described here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_file . Question was not about drives or some specific hardware. <comment54974> @OleksandrBolotov, What are you asking? The first sentence of the wikipedia article reads: `In Unix-like operating systems, a device file or special file is an interface for a device driver that appears in a file system as if it were an ordinary file.`. Then you state that your question is not about that; it's a complete contradiction. I realize that your English is not perfect, so maybe you can't exactly translate what you might be trying to say [?]. <comment54983> I just wanted to know what does OSX have instead of /dev/dsp and I don't know how to ask it better.  I don't know who down-voted your questions but that wasn't me. <comment259343> Alex's question and responses are spot on. One of the innovations of unix in 1970 was that every device appears as a file (in /dev). You could thus read and write to a device in a hardware independent way. So in this case you would expect to see something like /dev/audio for the system audio input/output, and perhaps variants on that if additional audio devices are present. To manage parameters like sample rate, a second device, like /dev/audioctl is provided in Unix. It seems that OSX is not sufficiently unix-like to have them. <comment259344> OPs question is about the visibility of devices as streams in a hardware/driver independent way in /dev or /devices or similar.
