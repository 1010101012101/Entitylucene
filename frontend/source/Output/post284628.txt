Why Apple doesn't have UEFI BIOS menu? <body> I'm just wondering why Apple notebooks and desktops doesn't have a BIOS menu like most other PC vendors?  <answer284631> UEFI and BIOS are two separate technologies. If you want something similar in functionality, try downloading and installing rEFInd. It provides a far more advanced boot menu, including a full UEFI shell.  <comment358921> Asking why Apple does X is off-topic. Please edit this if you are trying to work around limitations. "Given Apple does/did X, how can I do Y?" often works to make this more practical about using product instead of discussing Apple's motivations or plans or design.
