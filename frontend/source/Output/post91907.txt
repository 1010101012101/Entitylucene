Not able to send emails through Microsoft Outlook on iPhone <body> I use Microsoft Outlook as my email client but I also have separate Gmail account on my iPhone 4S which has no problems sending or receiving emails.

If it's the latter, then the answer from HelpingHand is the one you need.  If it's the former, then you'll need to tell us who provides your email service (your employer, Comcast, or something else).  If you tell us what version of Outlook you're using, and on which operating system, we might be able to tell you how to get the necessary information out of Outlook.
