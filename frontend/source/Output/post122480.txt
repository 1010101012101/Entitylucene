Restore back up from iphone 4s which i put sim card into different 4s without losing data from the new one? <body> Here's a challenging one for you!  I have two iPhone 4S - work &amp; personal handset respectively.  I broke the screen on my work phone, which wasn't insured so I have put the sim card from that into my personal phone. I want the data from my work phone, which was backed up via iCloud. Some of the photos didn't automatically sync from my work phone to iCloud when I swapped sim card over that I took as I had no 3G or WiFi when these photos were originally taken.   All the aforementioned data I want on my personal phone, BUT I don't want to lose photos or contacts from my personal phone.   How do I do this?  Many thanks  <answer122513> ol liConnect your personal iPhone to a computer with iTunes and manually back it up./li liConnect your work iPhone to the same computer and manually back it up/li liRestore your personal iPhone with the backup from your work iPhone/li /ol  All the data from each phone will be kept in it's own file on your computer, and you won't need to rely on iCloud/3G/WiFi to ensure the data is saved correctly.  hr  h1Use iTunes/h1  You can use iTunes to back up and restore your content on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch.  emstrongNote that iTunes and iOS do not support installing backups of newer versions of iOS onto devices using earlier versions of iOS./strong/em  h3Back Up/h3  To back up the content on your iOS device, follow these steps:  ol liMake sure your computer has the latest version of iTunes./li liConnect your iOS device to your computer./li liChoose File strong/strong Devices strong/strong Back up. /li /ol  If you're using strongiTunes 10.7/strong or earlier, right-click the device from the list and choose strongBackup Now/strong.
