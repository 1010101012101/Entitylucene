How to type japanese kanji into Spotlight on OSX <body> Normally when I type in Japanese hiragana/kanatana, I have the option to arrow-down on the keyboard and select the kanji representation of what I typed.  If I do this in Spotlight, arrowing down cycles through the results spotlight found so far instead.  Is there some way to be able to do both in spotlight?  (this is on an American MacBook, btw)  <comment316607> For example, I'd like to be able to use Spotlight to open this file named "æ—¥.numbers".
