Display S.M.A.R.T. statistics for an SSD? <body> I purchased a couple of used Intel 320-series 160 GB SSDs. I attached one of the drives to my MacBook Pro running OS X 10.8 using a SATA III to USB 3.1 cable.  When I attempted to view the drive statistics, it resulted in emS.M.A.R.T. Status: Not Supported/em.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uCN6I.png" alt="enter image description here"  I'm fairly certain emS.M.A.R.T. Status: Not Supported/em is wrong. According to Intel Solid-State Drive 320 Series, S.M.A.R.T. is supported. From the document (section 5.4):     The Intel SSD 320 Series supports the SMART command set, which   consists of:      ul   liSMART READ DATA/li   liSMART READ ATTRIBUTE THRESHOLDS/li   liSMART ENABLE/DISABLE ATTRIBUTE AUTOSAVE/li   liSMART SAVE ATTRIBUTE VALUES/li   liSMART EXECUTE OFF-LINE IMMEDIATE/li   liSMART READ LOG SECTOR/li   liSMART WRITE LOG SECTOR/li   liSMART ENABLE OPERATIONS/li   liSMART DISABLE OPERATIONS/li   liSMART RETURN STATUS/li   liSMART ENABLE/DISABLE AUTOMATIC OFFLINE/li   /ul   How do I display the S.M.A.R.T. statistics for the SSD under OSX 10.8?  <answer228315> Getting  the SMART status is possible with these disks but not if they are attached to USB. The necessary ATA commands usually aren't propagated through the USB-controller.  You can try to get that working though by using OS X SAT SMART Driver.  <comment278537> Thanks klanomath. I prefer not to use a third party driver. Does Apple offer a command line tool to do it? Do you know if there are any Apple RARDARs covering Disk Utility and SMART drives? I'm interested in Apple-approved methods, and I'm having a heck of a time [searching for it](http://www.google.com/search?q=apple+radar+"s.m.a.r.t."+drive).
