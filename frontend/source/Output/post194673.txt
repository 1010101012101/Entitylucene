Dual-Boot Win7 and Apple? <body> First off, I have no idea what Apple calls their OS. I only use their iOS devices and I tried to avoid their computer OS as best as possible, however, I'm getting started in developing iOS apps. I need to either run the Apple OS in a VM or set up dual-booting. I have a few questions though that hopefully can get answered.  ol liWhere can I purchase a license for Apple?/li liI've never set up dual-booting before, how do I go about doing so with Win7 as my current OS? (Ideally using a different HDD)/li liIs there anything I should know before going ahead?/li /ol  <answer194675> Quite simply, you purchase a license for OS X by buying a Mac. It is licensed only for Apple hardware.   There is no other way to legitimately run it, either natively or in VM.   Running it on any other hardware would be against Apple's EULA &amp; would also be off-topic for StackExchange.   <answer194680> I do this on my MacBook using Bootcamp which comes with the Mac OS. It allows me to partition off my hard drive into 2 and by holding down the Alt key when the Mac boots, it asks which OS I'd like to start. I can only use one at a time though. Recently I prefer to just run a VM of Windows from inside my Mac OS using VirtualBox.  <comment232305> The Mac can dual boot into Windows and OS X - but you need to buy a version of Windows the standard version is only an update of the one that comes on your PC <comment232317> Well I'm not buying a Mac... I know for a fact that you can run OS X in a VM so if I can't dual-boot, I'm going to have to do that. <comment232320> You may want to take a look at this: http://superuser.com/questions/679896/what-are-the-technical-obstacles-that-doesnt-allow-osx-to-be-installed-in-a-pc. Anyway, the answer to your first question is that is not possible to purchase a license to OS X alone.
