Lenovo firmware ISO ruined my USB thumb drive - how to fix? <body> I've never seen this kind of thing before. I have a 32GB thumb drive, which I tried to put a Lenovo BIOS/firmware updater on. It didn't work out, so now I'm trying to format it, but I can't. Mac OS tells me the target disk is too small.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zJh6v.png" alt="enter image description here"  The thumb drive is now named HFET36US, and is apparently mis-reporting its capacity as 17.1MB. I've already tried formatting it via Disk Utility and the command line:  precodediskutil eraseDisk ExFAT NewName /dev/disk5 /code/pre  Which just gives the error:  precodeUnable to begin erase operation: The target disk is too small for this operation (-69771) /code/pre  <answer246829> Ok, fixed it via:  precodediskutil partitionDisk /dev/disk5 1 MBR ExFAT whatever 32GB /code/pre  I wasn't sure what the 'whatever' argument was supposed to be, but it worked.
