How can I remove an autocomplete suggestion from Safari's address bar? <body> A site that I visit frequently used to be located at:  precodehttp://www.site.com/sub/dir /code/pre  But now it's just located it:  precodehttp://www.site.com/sub /code/pre  The problem is, I visited the original location so often that Safari suggests it as the Top Hit and autocompletes it, even though it no longer exists (it returns a code404/code). So I start typing codehttp://www.site.com/sub.../code and Safari fills in the rest with the old URL that no longer works.  How can I remove the old URL so Safari no longer autocompletes it? I already went and found the URL in my history and deleted it, but it still suggests it as the Top Hit.  <answer122456> Go into your history and delete all visits to the website. Alternatively, it may be easier to just delete all of your history instead.  <answer147211> Go to codeSettings -&gt; Autofill -&gt; Other Forms/code, Tap codeEdit/code and remove your site and restart browser. It helped me.  <answer162225> Do you still have that problem.? If you solved it already, please share your answer with us.

This option will remove the address.  Why they hid this option is any bodies quess.  <answer194997> Alright- I've figured it out. I'm not even remotely bright, but here is the problem:  The reason that autocomplete keeps filling in the websites and bringing it up as a "top hit"  and suggesting things is because you have a link to that site saved in your bookmark folder.   Step 1: Delete all the sites from your bookmark folder that you do not want to show up in autocomplete.   Step 2: Clear all history, restart Safari, and Voilà - Autocomplete shows nothing.  <answer195203> deleting it from my bookmarks worked for me.  backstory:  typing yah for yahoo.com autofilled yahooligans.com (safari 8.0.7 on yosemite 10.10.4).  fix:  found it deep in a sub menu in the bookmarks folder and erased it.  now typing yah fills yahoo.com.  woo hoo and thanks!  <answer195794> ul liStart by typing in the website into the Safari URL bar "example Gmail"./li liThen at the bottom of the suggestions it'll show you codeSearch for 'gmail' in History/code./li liClick that option and then select all and press delete./li /ul  Worked like a charm for me.   <answer266890> If you don't want to delete all your preferences and history and bookmarks, and instead only delete the saved url (as posed in the original question), then the following shortcut might be helpful:   ol litype the following to open safari: ⌘-space, safari, enter/li lionce safari is open/active, type this to enable searching of history: ⌘-y, ⌘-f/li listart typing whatever url you wish to delete from your autocomplete, it will start filtering the displayed list./li liselect entries to be removed: (shift + scroll); or just use the mouse./li lipress the delete key/li /ol  <comment142948> "I already went and found the URL in my history and deleted it, but it still suggests it as the Top Hit" ;-) <comment143145> You could also try to quit Safari, run `plutil -convert xml1 ~/Library/Safari/History.plist`, open the plist in a text editor, and remove any entries for the page. <comment204121> That's for searching the website directly from the smart search field; has nothing to do with autocomplete. <comment207923> Did did not solve removing autocomplete. <comment232739> Please don't shout (use capitals) <comment233057> Welcome to Ask Different!

I've submitted an edit for you. <comment254796> This works great and explains the problem well. Sanaah's answer below gets you to the same place in fewer steps. <comment254833> I agree, and I've voted up that answer as well. <comment322264> @Tetsujin looks like an answer to me. <comment322268> It doesn't show that option to me <comment322270> Helped you what? <comment322271> Side point: you should let them know so they (hopefully) add a redirect. <comment322327> @AllDani - nope, it's a "this worked for me too" re-statement of an already-accepted answer. <comment322375> @Tetsujin I don't see an accepted answer. Which do you mean? <comment358321> I think this worked in previous versions of Safari, but is no longer available.  (I'm currently using Safari version 10.0.3).
