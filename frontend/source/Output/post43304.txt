Freeware for tiling windows <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   What Window Management Options exist for OS X?       I've seen many, many utilities for resizing windows (BST, Moom, Divvy, SizeUp...) but I wanted to know if there were any available for free. Most of these utilities have a free trial, but I'd expect there's at least emone/em available completely free.  So, is there one?  <answer43305> BetterTouchTool is a freeware application mainly for defining custom gestures of trackpads and Magic Mice, but it also has the ability to tile windows.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FH4Xb.png" alt="enter image description here"
