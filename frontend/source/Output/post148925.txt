How to sign in Messages app in Mac Mavericks from terminal <body> Is it possible to sign in Message app from terminal ? When I search for it, I only see on how to send imessage from terminal. Thus, how can I do that ?   <answer148929> strongMessages/strong supports AppleScript. You can view the strongMessages/strong's AppleScript dictionary using the strongAppleScript Editor/strong:  precodeApplications &gt; Utilities &gt; AppleScript Editor.app /code/pre  The AppleScript command codelog in/code suggests you can sign in programmatically:     stronglog in/strong emv/em : Log in to the specified service, or all services if none is specified. If the account password is not in the keychain the user will be prompted to enter one.   An example AppleScript to log in would be:  precodetell application "Messages"     -- Log into every session     log in end tell /code/pre  You can then use the osascript command line tool to issue AppleScript commands via the strongTerminal/strong:  An example codeosascript/code command to log in would be:  precodeosascript -e 'tell application "Messages" to log in' /code/pre  <comment175421> Than you, Graham Miln. I will try it. I will confirm if it works soon. <comment175422> Do you have any example code for log in ? <comment175428> I can start with : using terms from application "Messages"  on login finished with eventDescription  end login finished <comment175438> I have added examples for AppleScript and `osascript` approaches. <comment175439> Thank again, Graham Miln. And can you tell me how I can put my apple ID and password to know it works well or not ? <comment175441> I test the above codes in terminal, but nothing happens <comment175455> I have no experience scripting Messages with AppleScript. You may be able to attract better answers with new specific AppleScript questions – or through an AppleScript specific forum. <comment175549> yes, Graham Miln. I will go to that forum.
