iMessage stopped syncing <body> I have an iPhone (iOS 10) and a macbook (macOS 10). My SMS/iMessages used to be in sync between my computer and my iPhone.  At some point, not sure when, they stopped syncing.  ol liBoth devices are connected to my Apple ID./li liHandoff is enabled./li liiMessage is enabled./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9aDQl.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer291243> First of all, I've had a less than prefect experience with messages being delivered to both Mac and iPhone which I largely attribute to non-Apple devices.   To your problem, have you tried un-ticking phone numbers/email accounts and signing out on both devices? Quit app then re-lauching and signing back in?  <answer291255> Is it strongALL/strong your messages that stopped syncing, or just SMS? If it's just SMS, on your iPhone open Settings / Phone / Text Message Forwarding and make sure your Mac is checked. If it already is, uncheck it, wait a minute, then check it again.  If your Mac isn't receiving iMessages, try signing out of iCloud on your Mac, maybe reboot, then log back in.  <comment367842> You're onto something. It is currently disabled. When I try to turn it on, it says to enter the passcode shown on my mac, but nothing is shown. It triggers my Messages app to load, but no passcodes. I restarted both the iPhone and the Mac... <comment367866> You may need to sign out of iCloud and back in on your Mac.
