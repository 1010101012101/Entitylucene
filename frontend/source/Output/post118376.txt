iMac with Mavericks sometimes won't sleep <body> My mid 2012 iMac 27" with Mavericks sometimes won't sleep. Its screen is light up in the morning and I'm still logged in.

But that's always running. So I doubt it's Windows fault. Is there anything I can do to analyze why it did not sleep?  <answer118384> codebackupd/code is most of Time Machine. I think your computer is constantly backing up over a slowish network link such as WiFi.  I suspect that you have a large amount of file changes every day. Is the Windows image you are running in in Parallels being backed up? That could do it? Go into codeSystem Preferences/code  codeTime Machine/code and click on codeOptions.../code  This will allow you to exclude your image files from Time Machine.  If that doesn't work turn off codeTime Machine/code for a couple of days and see if the computer sleeps.  <comment138141> sleep prevented by coreaudiod, backupd, backupd -- <comment138142> I know. How to find out *why* it is doing that and *what* exactly causes the issue? <comment138143> Google: https://discussions.apple.com/message/16238880#16238880 <comment138156> Good hint. I have now optimized PD for integration with Time Machine. http://kb.parallels.com/de/8827
