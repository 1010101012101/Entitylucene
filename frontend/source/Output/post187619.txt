flac terminal app no longer works - giving me libogg.0.dylib errors <body> I've been a happy user of flac on the OS X Terminal. I mostly use it to either encode, or decode wav - flac  or flac - wav.  What I'm meeting nowadays is this:  precodeflac -d *.flac  dyld: Library not loaded: /usr/local/lib/libogg.0.dylib   Referenced from: /usr/local/bin/flac   Reason: no suitable image found.  Did find:     /usr/local/lib/libogg.0.dylib: mach-o, but wrong architecture     /usr/local/lib/libogg.0.dylib: mach-o, but wrong architecture Trace/BPT trap: 5 /code/pre  What should I do? I've tried to brew uninstall libogg and brew install libogg, but that did not actually help.  Is there some easy commandline version for OS X Yosemite 10.10.4 for unflac/flac or should I switch to some OS X app that does it for me? Which would you recommend?  <answer188092> Try this:   precodebrew uninstall libogg /code/pre  and then:   precodebrew install libogg --universal /code/pre  <comment221834> I've always just used [Max](http://sbooth.org) â€¦but I always prefer GUI to command line <comment221906> Tetsujin: It seems that Max does not render fully WAV compatible .wav-files. Not a solution, unfortunately <comment221909> compatible to what? I've used it quite happily for years <comment222206> I found XLD to be the solution that did result in compatible wavefiles. [XLD link for OSX](http://tmkk.undo.jp/xld/index_e.html) <comment222213> Yup - XLD is fine too, I use both - just Max is usually quicker to dial-in. XLD is only essential for 24-bit flac, as Max doesn't deal with those. <comment222418> Seems that you tried to reinstall libogg when you should try to reinstall flac. `brew uninstall flac`, `brew install flac --with-libogg`. <comment222471> @jherran hi, thanks. I did try your `brew uninstall flac` followed by `brew install flac --with-libogg`.  but the end result was this: `flac -d shonuff.flac  dyld: Library not loaded: /usr/local/lib/libogg.0.dylib   Referenced from: /usr/local/bin/flac   Reason: no suitable image found.  Did find:  /usr/local/lib/libogg.0.dylib: mach-o, but wrong architecture  /usr/local/lib/libogg.0.dylib: mach-o, but wrong architecture Trace/BPT trap: 5`  not entirely sure where to go from here. <comment222479> Ok, try this one: `brew uninstall libogg`, and then `brew install libogg --universal`... may work. <comment222521> @jherran that solved it! Thank you so so much!! Is there a way to tag your comment as the solution for this question? (sorry, I'm new here) <comment222523> @esaruoho I posted it as answer.
