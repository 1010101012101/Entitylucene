iMessage Freezes/Hangs when sending screen shots <body> Worked fine sending 114k file of .png screen-shot; a 254k file freezes it dead.  So bad that I couldn't open up a tab in Safari. I suspect Evil Forces, but would be amused to learn it's a known issue.  Tested further just now sending 169k jpg file: hung so badly that again couldn't type here in Safari. Like it's sucking up all the good electrons and puppies.  Kernel panic? And why?  <answer135419> I had similar problem just recently. Here is what I did.  follow this to fix the problem  ~/Library/Preferences  delete com.apple.ichat.plist  <comment160526> Thought you nailed it with the plist suggesting, but there is no such file, nor an imessage.plist <comment160527> ok, my messages was locking up. I deleted the ichat.plist! Don't ask why, I don't know how are they interrelated. copy the ~/Library/Preferences and paste in finders go to <comment160543> Again, not seeing that in my preferences folder. <comment160546> strange! you should find multiple iChatxxyy.plist files? are you on Mavericks? <comment161164> Yes, 10.9.3. Not seeing any plists, per above.
