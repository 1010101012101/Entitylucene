Mouse clicking not working <body> I have a Macbook Pro with a mouse issue. I can move the mouse around using the pad but I can't click (nothing happens when I try to click). I tried connecting a usb mouse and it behaves exactly the same; mouse pointer moves around on the screen and wakes the computer but when I click there is no response. The external mouse works fine on another computer. I have tried restarting the Macbook but that didn't change anything. Any ideas how to solve this?  <comment346755> Have you tried booting into [Safe Mode](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201262) to see if the problem exists there?  Hold `Shift` while booting.   If the problem goes away, then it has something to do with macOS or installed software.  If it still exists, it could be a hardware issue.  Also, be sure to indicate which MacBook Pro (year, model, etc.) and which version of macOS you are using. <comment346847> I agree with @Allan - you really should test to see if your trackpad/mouse work normally when you've booted into Safe Mode. Doing this will really help narrow down the problem. NOTE: Booting into Safe Mode will take longer than usual. Finally, as Allan says, you need to provide the exact model of MacBook Pro and version of macOS.
