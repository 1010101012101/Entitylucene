Will my iPhone ring once Lost Mode is deactivated? <body> Lost my phone, activated Lost Mode not long after. Wondering if I'm able to take my phone off Lost Mode from iCloud, call it and hopefully it rings? I think I lost it down an embankment.  <answer274822> Normally if a device is in Lost Mode, you can just play a sound using Find My iPhone directly. Choose the Play Sound option which will play a sound on the device for 2 minutes at full volume overriding silent.  If you still wish to call the device, you can disable Lost Mode and make the phone call normally.  <comment345615> Where does Find My iPhone say it is?
