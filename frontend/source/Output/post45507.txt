Where can I find software for the Mac Classic? <body> I just found a really great application: Mini vMac, a Mac Classic emulator (simple and one that actually works). Is there a place where I can find some actual software that was meant for the original Macintosh? I think someone I know might have some boxes of floppies, so would it be possible to copy files off of them? I don't want modern software that was made for emulators. Would the Apple website have some hidden like how they have old System 6+ downloads?  <answer45508> Apple's website has a page dedicated to Older Software Downloads for systems earlier than 8.1.  (They also still have a support page for OS 9, but the Downloads link on this page just links to the current OS X downloads page.)  <answer45511> In addition to AppleCare's Older Software Downloads list, there are a few other sites that host old Macintosh software, including Software for Classic Macs and Info-Mac Archive.  Wikipedia's list of old Macintosh software should also help you get names of specific applications.  <answer45533> Macintosh Garden is another good source.  <answer270161> You can download System 6, System 7 and MacOS 8 and 9 from my ftp server hosted on a 1992 Mac LCII running system 7.0.1:  ftp://oldservers.ddns.net/  <comment51841> Thanks! I didn't see that they also had other software.
