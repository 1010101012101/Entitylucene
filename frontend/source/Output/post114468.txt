Supply extra power from the iPad's USB host adapter <body> The Apple Camera Connection Kit as well as many third-party adapters allow one to use many USB devices with an iPad.  But most of these devices draw more power than iOS will provide.  Of course the max power output could be changed by flipping a bit somewhere in iOS' Mach system.  How can I enable a higher power limit? Is there an app in Cydia that does this?  <comment134158> Have you looked at this video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKJeolOrlQ0
