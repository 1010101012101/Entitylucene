After the installation, when I want to switch another operating systems already installed(mac osx and windows) they give booting error. How can the problem be fixed? I can only run with ubuntu.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iOczK.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment329597> Can you send a screenshot or quote the exact error message you're getting? Also, are you using rEFInd, or did you install GRUB?
