Is there a way to delete all photos in iCloud.com > Photos using a browser? <body> Is there a way to delete all photos in iCloud.com  Photos?  I can't see how to select them.  The only way I found is to click one by one by keeping Command (or the Windows key in Windows 10) pressed, which can be daunting if you have many photos.  <comment354457> https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/255696/4474 is your answer.
