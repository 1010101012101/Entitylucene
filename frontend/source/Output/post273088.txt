Why do fields turn black when using Preview to duplicate or print some pdfs? <body> I've come across a PDF form, whose editable fields turn black when, after completing the form, I try to:  ul liduplicate/li limove/li liprint, or/li liemail /li /ul  the form.  Here's what the form looks like when I download it. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iEhmG.png" alt="enter image description here"  And here's what it looks like when I try to take any of those actions listed above. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/L5zW1.png" alt="enter image description here"  Note: I didn't create the PDF, and I don't have (or want) Adobe Acrobat professional on my machine.  Has anyone else seen this before? (I have a workaround, which I'll share below.)  <answer273089> This is workaround, but it does the trick.  Use the print function to "print" a new version of the completed pdf  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZOAOf.png" alt="enter image description here"  This seems to restore the grey beneath the filled-in text, like so... img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JI8df.png" alt="enter image description here"
