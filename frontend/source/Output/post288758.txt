macOS Disable mouse acceleration in certain apps <body> Is there a way to disable mouse acceleration in certain apps? For instance disable in Team Fortress 2 but re-anable when the app doesn't have focus?  <answer288765> You can globally use the following command in Terminal (you must log out to take effect):  precodedefaults write .GlobalPreferences com.apple.mouse.scaling -1 /code/pre  To know what the current acceleration is, use this command:  precodedefaults read .GlobalPreferences com.apple.mouse.scaling /code/pre  For most mice in macOS, the default is set to code3/code or code2/code but some users may find values as low as code0.25/code or code0.12/code, it generally depends on what type of mouse you are having and the current version of macOS. The moderate value is code0/code to code3/code.  precodedefaults write .GlobalPreferences com.apple.mouse.scaling 0 /code/pre  Look at this useful AD post: How to disable mouse acceleration in Yosemite?  Also, for codeTF2/code game you can definitely use codeApple Automator/code: How to Use Automator in macOS     Â¡Hope this helps!   <comment364683> Is this to disable the acceleration in 1 app or system wide? I am looking to disable it in a select apps. <comment364684> System wide (globally). <comment364685> Ok, is it also possible to disable it in select apps such as Team Fortress 2? <comment364687> Try this: http://smoothmouse.com/ <comment364693> I just know the method to globally turn the acceleration off via Terminal. Don't know the method to disable it for TF2 only. Suppose there's third-party software for this specific performance. <comment364696> The links in the smoothmouse website might be useful. <comment364708> Also try this: https://github.com/docwhat/killmouseaccel <comment364727> Maybe USB Overdrive? [I've never used it so idk]. I use SteerMouse, which is great for everything else, but cannot do cursor speed per app either. <comment364728> Suppose "USB Overdrive" is robust solution.
