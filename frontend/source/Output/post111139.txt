Splitting LexisNexis text file <body> For my research I have a number of text (txt or doc) files. These have a large quantity of newspaper clippings in them.  I'd like to split these text files. Each clipping starts with      document X of Y   I know of the codesplit/code command line tool - is there some way to use split to divide the large text file into the Y number of files as indicated in the larger single (doc or txt) file generated by LexisNexis?  <answer111144> Split allows for a regexp pattern match so simply:  split -p pattern longfile.doc  Would start each new file when pattern was found. Nailing down which regexp matches your specific file might be better suited for http://stackoverflow.com but perhaps you know how to craft regexp and didn't realize split would match a pattern.  <comment130949> Unfortunately i am not familiar with either regexp or split. I found that one can use the command. Are you able to provide me with some more directions?
