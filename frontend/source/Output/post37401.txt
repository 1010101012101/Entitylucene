Audio Line-In passthrough <body> Below is my home layout. I've got most things setup the way I want. To get the line-in on my mini to play through the speakers (the TV) I am currently using LineIn. This works and does exactly what I want, embut/em it has a window thats always open. Is there a background application or service that I can have always run that will do the same thing?  I know there is AirFoil but it does way more than I need or want. I just want a simple Line-In to speaker passthrough that runs in the background. Ideally even when a user is not logged in.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BY8SU.png" alt="My home equipment layout"  em(yes lots of extra stuff in the picture, I got tired of making small specific pictures and just made one for everything)/em  <comment42542> Before I submit this as an answer, have you tried Soundflower, and/or can it solve your problem? <comment42544> @TimothyMueller-Harder it seems like Soundflower is an application thing, take the sound output from one application and use it as the input for another application. I don't see any options to have Soundflower passthrough line-in to speakers. <comment42545> I'm sorry! I don't know what I was thinking. At this point, I'd suggest LineIn, but I see you've already said that you want a background application. :\
