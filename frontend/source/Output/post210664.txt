Apple Wallet (formely Passbook) - Best way to add links <body> Does anyone have any experience with Apple Wallet (formerly Passbook) - I'm interested to know if it's possible to add hyperlinks on the reverse of the wallet?  It looks like you can simply add web addresses and apple auto applies a link tag to this but ideally I want to have the link address hidden behind the link title so it doesn't look messy?  <answer223104> Since iOS7 you can add hyperlinks to the back of a pass and format the text that is displayed.  Simply add an code&lt;a&gt;/code tag to the content of a field and the Apple Wallet app will render it as a clickable link.   For example: code&lt;a href="http://www.developer.apple.com"&gt;Click here&lt;/a&gt;/code  If you do not use an code&lt;a&gt;/code tag but include a valid URL the Apple Wallet app will display it as clickable address.
