PPC emulator to run Tiger <body> This might seem like an odd request: There are some classic and early OSX apps which I really enjoyed using and I would like to revive. Is there an emulator which can run the versions of MacOSX Tiger created to run on computers with PPC architecture?  <answer250457> I'd install an Intel version of Mac OS X 10.5-10.6 in a virtual machine and use it to run PowerPC apps thru Rosetta. Intel version of Tiger 10.4.4 might be possible to install too, but I only tried 10.5 and 10.6.  If you really need to emulate PowerPC version of Tiger, there's PearPC project:  <comment310454> No. There is a Mac OS 9 emulator, but I'm not sure if it's on topic to discuss here.
