Wireless transfer from camera <body> I have a Nikon D750, D7100, and D300, and I shoot on about 5 - 10 SD cards per event.   I noticed that the new Macbook Pros don't include an SD slot, and Apple is advocating for "Wireless data transfers" from the camera.   Is anyone familiar with how to do this? Not seeing a lot of info online for DSLR cameras.   <comment327835> Not sure about Nikon cameras, but Canon has their own app for OS X/macOS to remotely connect the camera to the laptop. You'll be able to download images and do basic controls (change settings, press the shutter button, etc.) with it. I found this in Nikon's website: http://www.nikonusa.com/en/learn-and-explore/article/gx2q3t90/wired-and-wireless-file-transfer.html <comment328644> I haven't been able to get this to work. Nikon still requires you to plug the camera in for the initial setup. I'd feel silly buying an adapter to use it once. There's got to be a way to get files from DSLR cameras to a mac that doesn't require more wires and dongles than I used with my 2008 iMac with an SD slot.
