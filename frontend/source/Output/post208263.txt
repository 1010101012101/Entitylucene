How to download only recent mails in Apple Mail.app on El Capitan? <body> I have an account at Hotmail/Outlook.com and I have lots of mails there since 2006 (dozens of GB). I am using IMAP and I don't want Mail.app to download them all, also because I have really slow connection (and I dont care about my emails from 2006.)  Is there a way to make Mail.app download only mails more recent than, for example, 10 or 30 days ago?  <answer208914> This doesn't seem possible in Mail.app.   As a workaround your e-mail provider may allow you to limit the amount of e-mails available over IMAP.
