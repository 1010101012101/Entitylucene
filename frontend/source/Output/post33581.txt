Lion OS Remove Categorizing in Finder <body> i just got my hands on lion after some years in previous mac versions. There is a feature in finder that i absolutely hate though. When i select Arrange By - Date Modified, for instance, i get a categorized, incredibly inefficient view. Is it possible to get what i would normally get on leopard, just a list of last modified files, without the horrendous categories ?  <answer33582> Use the "clean up by" option, not the "arrange by" one.  <comment38284> :O i only see an arrange by option <comment38285> Brain fart, my bad, check the answer out again <comment38294> great thankyou !
