How can I average numbers using Soulver? <body> I have a license for the excellent app, Soulver. I'd like to use it to find the average of some integers. I'd like to do something like:  precodeavg(199, 262, 219, 268, 285, 293) /code/pre  However, that doesn't work:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vZp0S.jpg" alt=""  Any suggestions on how to do this with Soulver?  <answer29710> Soulver can only calculate the average of the results in the right column. To display you have to click on the "Total:" in the bottom line of the window:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/96XwM.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer29712> Soulver doesn't let you do this with an operation, but there are a few ways to do it. First of all, there's the old fashioned way:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/n2tij.png" width="500" /  Add your numbers up (in parentheses) and then divide by the number of numbers.  There's also a more automated but less convenient way. Soulver can calculate the average of the results (blue column) that are currently in your document:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SYPVF.png" width="500" /  But, if you want to use that average later, you'll have to do a bit more.  Select Average, then click on codeCopy Selected Statistic/code.  Add a new line to your Soulver document: codeavg =/code and then paste in the average. You now have an average that you can rever to via codeavg/code:  img src="https://imgur.com/dAhSm.png" width="500" /
