Why does Google Chrome fail to draw tabs correctly when the Discrete graphics adapter is in use? <body> Google Chrome fails to paint browser tabs correctly while the Discrete graphics adapter is in use.  I have an Early 2011 15" MacBook Pro running OSX 10.10.5 (Yosemite) and am running Chrome Version 53.0.2785.143 (64-bit). This problem began about a month ago.  <answer263766> Not sure if this is still relevant to you but maybe this will help you:   MacBook Pro Repair Extension Program for Video Issues  Basically your GPU might be faulty and Apple will fix it for free.  <comment330795> Heh, already had this machine repaired to address that very issue some time ago. The symptoms were very different though.
