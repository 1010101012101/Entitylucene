Download OS update only once for all home computers <body> I want to upgrade all my home computers (4 macbooks running 10.8) to the new Mavericks OS.   I have a download cap, so i dont want to download it 4 times. How can i download it once and install it on all computers?  <answer106683> To quote Bryan Luby from "Re-use Mavericks install file"     Download the update from the App Store. Once the file has finished downloading, check your Applications folder for the "Install OS X Mavericks" icon. Copy this installer to your other computers before going through the install process. The installer will delete itself after the install is finished.   I recommend distributing the file between computers via AirDrop (if all your computers support it) or via File Sharing (from the Sharing pane of System Preferences).  strongemNote:/em/strong Running the update from code/Applications/Install OS X Mavericks.app/code will DELETE the installer upon completion! Be sure to distribute the file to all your machines before installing it.  <answer106689> As an alternative to copying and running the installer from within Mac OS X, you can also create a bootable USB flash drive to install Mavericks on a Mac without any prep.
