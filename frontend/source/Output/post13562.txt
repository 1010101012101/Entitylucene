how to print or export annotations in a pdf file? <body> I have a pdf file containing annotations from someone else (I assume they are made in windows with some Adobe software, but I'm not sure).  They look like that: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oW0AJ.png" alt="enter image description here"  and can be displayed in codePreview.app/codeor codeSkim.app/codeon the left of each page: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4sErY.png" alt="enter image description here"  However, I'd like to print them (together with the pages) and/or find a way to export them to a text document.  How can I do that?  <answer13589> Skim has a "Take Snapshot" feature which allows you to print anything which is visually on the page. It also has a "Convert Notes" feature which turns PDF annotations into "skim notes" which you can then manipulate.  All of this is under the File Menu:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HoSwi.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer86666> This is probably too late but I think I know the answer, so maybe it'll help someone. What you probably want to do is  ol liConvert notes to skim notes/li liGo to codeFile &gt; Export &gt;/code choose emFile format/em either codeNotes as RTF/code or codeNotes as text/code./li /ol  This answers your 'export to text document' questions. I don't see how you could print the PDF together with the text in the anchored notes, though.  <answer116856> There is a really simple yet robust tool for extracting highlights, notes and images from your pdf-files available at: http://www.sumnotes.net . Not only it supports various advanced features like exporting to DOC and TXT formats, but it also allows you to send extracted highlights into your Evernote account or email. All desktop browsers and operating systems are supported. We are in cloud, so no installation is needed. Try it out.  <answer145469> I faced the same problem. To resolve it I created a free service to extract annotations from PDF to CSV: http://exportpdf.info . It exports only sticky and text notes, it does not export highlights and images. You can edit/print CSV files with any major editor like Microsoft Excel or LibreOffice Calc.  <answer158363> http://www.pdfhighlights.com extracts all your highlights and annotations from multiple PDFs into a single report from which you can click through to the PDF containing each annotation.  <comment14494> thank you. The "convert notes" feature lets me convert the notes to "real" skim notes, however to those which are displayed also only as a symbol on the page, so the **real content** of the notes is not displayed on the page and I still don't see how to print it (I also tried the snapshot feature). :-( <comment14516> Weird, because when I used the snapshot feature I got a pdf with notes on page if they were skim notes, I can see the garish yellow boxes everywhere. As it is supposed to print out essentially a screenshot of the content(and you can see the notes in the screenshot) <comment14586> I think it depends on the kind of note: The notes were automatically converted to an **anchored** Skim note which is represented in the document only by a symbol and is displayed in a separate window <comment136642> Welcome to Ask Different!
