iCloud Drive folders dissappared <body> Normally when I click on my iCloud drive, I see this:  precodeiCloud  |--Pages  |--Numbers  |--Keynote /code/pre  However, now, when I click on iCloud drive, I am presented with a new folder called codecom~apple~CloudDocs/code.  All the Pages, Numbers and Keynotes sub folders have disappeared (and the documents within them).  How can I get my folders (and documents!!!) back?  <answer218004> Logging out and back in seems to fix the issue.  <comment262757> Sometimes I have this issue. Try logging out and back in. <comment263446> @IronCraftMan Please post as answer, so I can mark as correct.
