El Capitan, or earlier TextEdit editing <body> A long-standing question: how does one move or delete default tabs in TextEdit -- on ALL lines of document. In other words, if I want to move the tab for all the lines in a document, rather than moving a particular tab on each line.  <comment283031> I don't know if I understand your question, but how about selecting the whole text (âŒ˜+A) and then moving the tab? By tab you mean those black triangles at the top of the document?
