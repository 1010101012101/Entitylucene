Shortcuts & gestures you can't live without <body> What are some gestures or shortcuts you use on a daily basis that you can't live without?  I've found the BetterTouchTool preference pane add on to be great for creating custom gestures on a per app or universal basis  <answer6332> Three finger swipe left or right to move between tabs in my browsers.

To re-enable it, find Keyboard Shortcuts Accessibility.  Or, after OS X 7, it won't be as smooth (even if you do practice positioning the mouse):  kbd⌥/kbd+kbd⌘/kbd+kbdF5/kbd then select emInvert Display colors/em (apple article)  <answer10221> Safari/Chrome/Firefox:  three-finger-click: kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbdW/kbdbr two-finger-swipe-up: kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbd&#x21E7;/kbd+kbdT/kbd  This makes closing and reopening tabs super easy. With a three-finger click I can close a tab, and a two finger swipe up I can reopen it.

I use this to switch between tabs if I'm just browsing the web.  <answer10263> These are my current BetterTouchTool settings:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uJC5M.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer10321> I'd rather use strongKeyCue/strong from Ergonis Software which helps me find all the shortcuts and gestures an app can have. Check it out here!

Works in practically every OS X app that has a preference pane.  By comparison, in Windows preferences don't have a common shortcut and the menu entry, typically labelled either "Preferences" or "Options", can be found pretty much anywhere in the menu hierarchy (although often it's in one of Edit, Tools or View). Command-comma was one of the things I really loved when I switched to OS X.  <comment6635> This should be made community wiki <comment6638> Thanks - I was going to do so, but didn't see a way when I was creating my 'question' <comment10707> Combine with cloudApp to insta-upload on the web and put the URL in your clipboard instead <comment10710> I can't find the "~" on my apple keyboard! :O <comment10711> hahahahaha was my reaction ;) how did you find out about it? <comment10712> @Alvar I'm a keyboard freak. When I first started using macs few years ago, moving from windows and missing some shortcuts, I went through System Preferences, Help files and Google looking for what was already available. I actually found it on the Help, tho it's also in SP - Keyboard. <comment10715> It should be to the left of the 1 key :) <comment10738> I noticed that it didn't work if you have "unchecked" the help bar in the system settings. I have the swedish version so I don't now what it says in english, just guessing. <comment10739> there is §¶° (normal, alt, shift) <comment10743> Ah, I guess it depends on your keyboard version.  I'm referring to the standard North American English keyboard.  It's called the Tilde if you want to look it up: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilde#Computing <comment10745> @Alvar I have no idea what's that "help bar". Can you provide more relevant info? From that symptom alone, I don't think it has anything to do with the swedish version. <comment10844> "Three-finger swipe down in Google Chrome - show tab exposé" - What?! Chrome does this? It's not working for me :( <comment10982> On a UK Apple keyboard it's in the bottom left. The lowest row of letter keys is: {shift} ~ Z X C V etc. It can also be to the far right of L next to the enter key. <comment11043> I just upgraded my Chrome and I can't do it now either... <comment11044> Found it: http://osxdaily.com/2011/03/04/activate-tab-overview-in-chrome-to-get-expose-for-the-web/ <comment24124> Also use the ⌥ Option key to resize from the center, and the spacebar to move the selection before letting go. <comment24322> My all time favorite keyboard shortcut!!!! <comment24324> How do you get the commands to appear with keys? <comment24345> Or, throw in the option key, and it won't even ask you if you're sure you want to empty it. ;) <comment24347> This is a huge benefit.  Windows fails compared to the mac on this "feature" alone. <comment24374> Note: Holding down shift only works when you are performing the window management functions (minimise, etc...) *with the mouse*. E.g. kbd⌘ Command/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbdM/kbd does not work. <comment24376> What? No key symbols in comments? <comment24379> How do you execute this shortcut on a japanese layout? The Tilde is a shift character.... <comment24380> What, exactly, is this supposed to do? It does nothing on my (Japanese) keyboard. <comment24381> @Jamie Ctrl+Shift+V is implemented in many applications on windows too. <comment24458> @Fake there, I've added a link to make it clear. ;) <comment24473> @Fake Name Really?  Hmm.  I'm using XP right now.  Is this the case there?  Because it doesn't work in Word. <comment24602> @Jamie - What version of word? This is a function implemented *in individual applications*, not an OS function. As such, it's really not valid to claim it's something special for OS X. I know LibreOffice/OpenOffice has this shortcut, because I use it regularly. <comment24654> @Fake Name  Office 2007, and no dice.  I don't have the opportunity to test this on W7 right now, but I haven't got any functionality out of it here.  You may be right about the individual applications, but it functions in all the ones I've tried it on, which says something to Apple at least trying to keep things consistent.  (TextEdit, Pages, Keynote, Numbers, Mail, maybe NeoOffice..?) <comment45120> ⌘ + ⇧ + 4 saves a PNG, not a JPG, on the desktop.
