How to quit 'screen' if you don't have \ on the keyboard <body> To quit codescreen/code you need to hit codectrl+a, ctrl+\/code. How do you do that if you don't have code\/code on the keyboard?  On my keyboard I need to hit codeshift+alt+7/code to get a backslash - if I'm in an editor. Won't work for codescreen/code of course.  <answer238911> One solution I meanwhile found was to create code~/.screenrc/code and add codebind q quit/code to it. This allows me to quit by typing codectrl+a, q/code.
