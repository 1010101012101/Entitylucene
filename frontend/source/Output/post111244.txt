How to install apache24 and php55 from macports? <body> I need apache24 because of some features what introduced in 2.3. And (unfortunately) need php too.  So decided to install the next ports:  ul liapache24-devel/li liphp55/li liand php55-apache2handler/li /ul  For some reason the php55-apache2handler builds apache22. Is it possible to have an apache24 codevariant/code?  What are the steps to installing apache24 with php? I need compile everything compiled manually from sources.   As an alternative should I migrate to "homebrew"? Is here some macports based solution?  emps: using 10.9/em  <answer113493> That's a bug in the php55-apache2handler port: http://trac.macports.org/ticket/41478
