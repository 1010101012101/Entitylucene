Running Time Machine only 1 time a day at 02:00am? <body> I must say that Time Machine is pretty useful, and it saved me a couple of times. The problem is it seems running all the times, and slowing the system down pretty often.  Is there a way/tool to run Time Machine only once a day, say 02:00am. And, it would be better if the Time Machine wakes the Mac up and after it's done with the backup, go to sleep again.   h2ADDED/h2  I installed and ran the 'Timemachine Editor' as advised, but it doesn't work. I mean, even though I set the timemachine to run 02:00am, it just runs every hour.  I use Snow Leopard 10.6.4. Is there anything that I missed?  <answer1429> As you said that Time MAchine Editor didn't work fine for you then I search in web and find :  TimeMachineScheduler it disables the automatic backup function of Time Machine and installs its own launchd daemon.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/puE9m.jpg" alt="alt text"  Time Machine Editor (strongfree/strong software) allows you to specify a schedule for Time Machine to run. it changes the one-hour interval of Time Machine backups. You can change the interval or decide to make strongemdaily/em/strong, strongemweekly/em/strong and strongemmonthly/em/strong backups.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/g3OqV.jpg" alt="alt text"  <answer1483> Use Carbon Copy Cloner instead.  It uses the same underlying stuff as Time Machine.   You can set a scheduled task for 2am that does an Incremental Backup with the "archive deleted or modified files" option checked.  Here's what mine looks like... create something like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/V2pJU.png" alt="setup"  Then click save task.  It should look like this in the saved tasks window:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rgLPT.png" alt="tab 1"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QSl4n.png" alt="tab 2"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VZCwe.png" alt="tab 3"  <answer117910> Time Machine Backup Scheduler does scheduling backup:  https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/time-machine-backup-scheduler/id668331139?mt=12
