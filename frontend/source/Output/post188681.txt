Closest equivalent of dstat on mac <body> It seems that only codeiostat/code were available on mac. But I am looking for more comprehensive set of stats including cpu, memory, and network.  What are the options here?  <answer188792>    Dstat is a versatile replacement for vmstat, iostat and ifstat. Dstat   overcomes some of the limitations and adds some extra features.   As you said, codeiostat/code is available on macs. But, additionally you can install codeifstat/code using homebrew by typing the following:  precodebrew install ifstat /code/pre  To install homebrew -if you haven't it yet-, just use the following command:  precoderuby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" /code/pre  <comment228842> Turns out I really need dstat- and not something else.. I do charts for demos off of it.  Big big hole in the mac offering.
