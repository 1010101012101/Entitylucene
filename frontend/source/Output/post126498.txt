Time machine: exclude items causes long "calculating full size of backup..." delay <body> The preferences of Time Machine crash when I click options. This is what I did:  I have a new hard disk to back up. I connected the hard disk to my iMac (Mac OS 10.9.2) I accept the invitation to dedicate the disc to Time Machine. I open the preferences, click Option and I try to exclude some items from back ups. I select some files and I click Save. The circle with colors moving appears meaning that is thinking, but it never ends.  I force Quit Applications and select Preferences. I put Time Machine off. I re start the computer. I open again the Preferences  Time Machine. But when I click to option it gets stuck again. I see the files that I excluded from back up and the sentence "calculating size of full backup..." But the circle with colors never ends.   What can I do?  <comment148215> by "never ends" how long do you mean? Have you let it run overnight? <comment148311> @dwightk: no, I have not let it run overnight, I let it run something more than 1 hour (we are talking about the options panel). The problem comes when I select the Applications folder to exclude. Notice that if I do not force quit from preferences I cannot work with the computer, the keyboard does not work.
