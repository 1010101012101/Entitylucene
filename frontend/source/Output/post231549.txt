Cannot reformat external drive with no file system <body> This whole mess started with trying to encrypt Time Machine backups. I have a 4TB Lacie P9230 external drive which has been working for about a year just fine. The drive has been partitioned into two partitions, one for TM backups and other as archive and other stuff that isn't important or can be downloaded from the internet. When I tried to enable Time Machine encryption, the process failed and the backup partition disappeared. Disk Utility listed it as grey and couldn't mount it or something. Then I did the wisest thing and simply unplugged the drive's power cord and reconnected. Now it's in this weird state where the volume apparently doesn't have a file system nor does the backup partition. The archive partition has a file system (JHFS+) and it is visible in Finder, but all the folders are there but they empty even though Disk Utility shows the correct amount of data used. I did try reformatting the whole volume, copying code/dev/zero/code but nothing worked.   strongdiskutil list:/strong  precode/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *251.0 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:                  Apple_HFS SSD                     250.1 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3 /dev/disk1 (internal, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk1    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk1s1    2:                  Apple_HFS 1TB                     999.9 GB   disk1s2 /dev/disk2 (external, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *4.0 TB     disk2    1:                        EFI EFI                     1.1 GB     disk2s1    2:          Apple_CoreStorage Backup                  1.5 TB     disk2s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Boot OS X               134.2 MB   disk2s3    4:                  Apple_HFS Data                    2.5 TB     disk2s4 /dev/disk3 (disk image):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:     Apple_partition_scheme                        +18.1 MB    disk3    1:        Apple_partition_map                         32.3 KB    disk3s1    2:                  Apple_HFS Flash Player            18.1 MB    disk3s2 /dev/disk4 (external, virtual):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                  Apple_HFS                        +1.5 TB     disk4                              Logical Volume on disk2s2                              97716389-E391-4260-BE72-82DBB2262907                              Unlocked Encrypted /code/pre  The drive in question is codedisk2/code. codedisk4/code seems to be the logical CoreStorage volume for the backup partition.  strongdiskutil info disk2:/strong  precode Device Identifier:        disk2  Device Node:              /dev/disk2  Whole:                    Yes  Part of Whole:            disk2  Device / Media Name:      P9230   Volume Name:              Not applicable (no file system)   Mounted:                  Not applicable (no file system)   File System:              None   Content (IOContent):      GUID_partition_scheme  OS Can Be Installed:      No  Media Type:               Generic  Protocol:                 USB  SMART Status:             Not Supported   Total Size:               4.0 TB (4000787030016 Bytes) (exactly 7814037168 512-Byte-Units)  Volume Free Space:        Not applicable (no file system)  Device Block Size:        4096 Bytes   Read-Only Media:          No  Read-Only Volume:         Not applicable (no file system)   Device Location:          External  Removable Media:          No   Virtual:                  No  OS 9 Drivers:             No  Low Level Format:         Not supported /code/pre  strongdiskutil info disk2s2 (backup partition):/strong  precode Device Identifier:        disk2s2  Device Node:              /dev/disk2s2  Whole:                    No  Part of Whole:            disk2  Device / Media Name:      Backup   Volume Name:              Not applicable (no file system)   Mounted:                  Not applicable (no file system)   File System:              None   Partition Type:           Apple_CoreStorage  OS Can Be Installed:      No  Media Type:               Generic  Protocol:                 USB  SMART Status:             Not Supported  Disk / Partition UUID:    F212F25E-748A-4852-A09C-B05CAF59CC9A   Total Size:               1.5 TB (1500000026624 Bytes) (exactly 2929687552 512-Byte-Units)  Volume Free Space:        Not applicable (no file system)  Device Block Size:        4096 Bytes   Read-Only Media:          No  Read-Only Volume:         Not applicable (no file system)   Device Location:          External  Removable Media:          No    This disk is a Core Storage Physical Volume (PV).

Finder still doesn't show anything in the folder.  I have tried reformatting the volume in Disk Utility, but it either cannot unmount it or cannot write to the last block. I then tried running this codesudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/rdisk2 bs=64k/code which resulted in the following error:  precodedd: /dev/rdisk2: Input/output error 1+0 records in 0+0 records out 0 bytes transferred in 0.005369 secs (0 bytes/sec) /code/pre  codediskutil zeroDisk force /dev/disk2/code didn't help either:  precodeStarted erase on disk2 Error: -69759: Securely erasing data to prevent recovery failed Underlying error: 5: POSIX reports: Input/output error /code/pre  I have ran out of things to try on this drive. I have started to wonder whether the drive itself is starting to fail, but it was working just fine before I started messing around with it. If anyone has a solution that could preserve the data that would be perfect, but I don't really expect that to be even possible. All the data is disposable so if I could just reformat it and get back to using it (unless it is failing).  strongE1:/strong The archive partition has magically restored some of the data, meaning I can now access data in the drive that was previously missing. Some data is still missing and I don't have a spare drive with sufficient capacity where I could offload the data in case it is failing.   strongE2:/strong The drive works perfectly when connected to another Mac. It shows that it is encrypting (0%), so I'll let it finish the encryption and reinstall OS X on my main machine so that once the drive is encrypted, I hope it will be detected normally.   <answer231893> Apparently I was asking the wrong question. After attaching this "corrupted" drive to another Mac, it simply asked for the password and mounted the drives with all their data as normal. I let the other Mac finish the encryption process, reinstalled OS X on my main machine and reconnected the drive and it now works perfectly.   <comment282794> Please add the output of `sudo gpt -r show /dev/diskX` after checking the disk identifier of the 4 TB disk with `diskutil list`. Replace diskX by the disk identifier found.
