Is there an alternate way to get receipts from the Mac App Store <body> I purchased an app (Divvy) from the Mac App Store ten days ago and still have not received an email receipt for the purchase. The e-mail address in the App Store Account Settings is correct and it's not in the Spam folder. The same account gets receipts fine when I make purchases in the iTunes Store.   Is there a way to either:  ol liView old receipts somewhere, or/li liGet receipts emailed again?/li /ol  The reason I need the receipt itself is so I can turn in an expense report. In the case of Divvy, it's not that expensive, but if I can't get receipts, I'm certainly not going to make further purchases.   <answer23244> You should always be able to see your up to date purchase history from the App Store menu.   Store - View my account...  Sign in and look over your purchase history. I'm not aware of a way to get an email summary or duplicate receipts mailed again.   <answer23252> I had this issue for something I bought and needed a receipt, but Apple did not send an email which it used to do (for the apps that I did not need to claim on expenses).  To get a receipt, I contacted Apple support via their web form. Note that that might be the UK form only.  To get there got to apple.com, choose support on the top bar; then choose "Mac App Store" and "Contact Support  Account and Billing."  <answer23257> While going off of the recommendation from @Mark to contact Apple Support I found a way to (kind of) get a receipt by following the directions on this page which shows you how to get order numbers.   Basically, in iTunes, you click on your username/email-address and then log in. This will bring up your Account Information window where you can select the "See All" under the "Purchase History" section. This will take you to a list of transactions.   Unfortunately, you can't print these out directly, but you can take a screen grab of the receipt (Cmd+Shift+3 or Cmd+Shift+4) and then print the resulting graphic.   A little bit of a hack, but it gets you there.   <comment25931> Yeah, I can see that alright. (It's actually just under the "Purchases" tab/button.) The trick is that I need the receipt for an expense report. Not a huge deal for this purchase, but I'm certainly not going to continue to buy stuff that I can't get reimbursed for. (Note: I update the original question to help clarify that.) <comment25955> U.S. support page is found at: http://www.apple.com/support/mac/app-store/ - While looking for the order number that page requested, I found a knowledge base article that got me to the receipt. I've added an answer to this question with those details. Thanks for getting me pointed in the right direction. <comment25962> I've never had an expense report declined when I print a screen capture or just fill out a missing expense receipt form as needed. You could ask nicely to [billing support](http://www.apple.com/support/itunes/account/) (look for Express Lane on the page) - they might be able to help. <comment170357> You can try to print it via CMD+P, Print popup window is there, but I can only see the empty page. <comment170358> Or try directly at: https://getsupport.apple.com/ServiceOptionAction.action <comment243212> It is ridiculous, and it is not the first time with apple :)
