Why is my iOS not detecting Bluetooth device names? <body> I am trying to list of bluetooth devices from my app.   My Bluetooth is enabled in settings but doesn't detect device names.  brbr img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IXlMG.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer84850> The BT device that you are looking for has to be in emdiscovery mode/em, or set to always emdiscoverable/em in order to be visible to such device searches.  <answer288915> you can use apps like lightBlue or BLE scanner  <comment94861> iOS version? And jailbroken or not? <comment94863> Restarted the phone already? <comment94864> @Globalnomad version 6.0.1 and not jailbroken device <comment94865> @patrix i restarted even though its not coming <comment94872> Are you sure the other bluetooth-device is working correctly? Test with another device and see if that shows up. <comment94873> i tested in 2 ios devices i am not getting any list but in non ios devices i am getting these devices if i ask for pair its showing alert to pair but is not connecting and no showing device name also <comment94874> It won't connect on non-iOS-devices? <comment94875> not connecting to non-ios-devices and not showing ios devices <comment94899> What device do you want to pair? Not all devices are supported. <comment95037> even it not showing ios devices also <comment97869> see in screenshots both are showing now discoverable <comment99168> @ganeshmanoj Borderline means the other Bluetooth devices must be in discovery mode, not your iDevice. The `Now Discoverable` message applies to your iDevice. <comment99379> @jaume ya others are also in discoverable mode only and those two screen shots are from two devices <comment99383> @ganeshmanoj I see, that's not clear from your question, you should add more information to it: what device is your app running on? Or is it running in the simulator? Can those other two devices (the ones in the screenshots) be detected from, say, a computer? <comment364899> Welcome to Ask Different!

I'd personally recommend Find Blue as well.
