OS X Leopard Safari shows questionmark? <body> The Safari icon indicates a question mark. And, it wont let me go to internet etc. How do I find the Safari app and activate it?   <answer223054> Pratika Rana is correct: your icon for Safari in the dock is no longer working. Remove it from the dock by dragging it out or by control-clocking and selecting 'remove from dock'  ul lifind Safari by opening finder and choosing Go - Applications f of the menu. Double-click to open./li liSafari, once it starts, will now have a new icon in your dock. Control-click its icon and select 'keep in dock' to make sure it doesn't disappear as you as you quit Safari./li /ul  <comment270278> I suppose the question mark shows in the dock. You can remove it from there. You should find the Safari app in Applications folder.
