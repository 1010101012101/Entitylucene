Mail storage issue <body> My iPhone 6 is iOS 10.1.1 and the mail app has taken up 2 GB of space and now I can't do anything (take pics, get apps, etc). I have taken steps like deleting my mail account and rebooting the phone, but when I go to Settings it still is using 2 GB of storage.  <comment327678> You mean you deleted your email account completely from your phone but it still uses 2GB? What type of email account is it? <comment328874> It's a gmail account <comment328875> Is it the only email account on your phone? <comment329816> No I had 3 gmail accounts on my phone but I deleted all of them off my phone
