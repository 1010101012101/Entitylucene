Apple external (magic) keyboard: SHIFT + [ not working <body> Im having some weird problem. I have connected my magic keyboard via USB.  When I type "code[/code" its working as you see. Also when I type codeSHIFT + ]/code I get "code}/code".  PROBLEM: But when I try to type codeSHIFT + [/code I cant get left curly bracket. (Its working on my internal keyboard)  PRAM reseted. Keyboard layout - English. No shortcuts on this combinations made. Sticky keys OFF, slow keys OFF. Dictation OFF.  What could be the problem ? Maybe I could delete some Library/Preferences or something ? I cant code without that brackets   <answer268857> I had a problem like this once. What I did was look through the accessibility settings to try to find something, but it seems like you already did that with dication. You could also delete some .plist's that have to do with the keyboard, but I would only do that if you have a backup of your computer  <comment337680> Do the key presses show up on the key caps / keyboard viewer? (You can start it from the internationalization menu) <comment337702> Only Shift shows up <comment337716> In that case it might be a keyboard or keyboard firmware issue and not one in macOS. <comment337717> I would also say that this is hardware problems, but if [ button working, it shouldnt be the keyboard. <comment337732> The keyboard uses a matrix of connections and detects where the shorts are to find out the keys that were pressed. If something is wrong with that matrix or with the interpretation (the keyboard controller), individual keys might work, but some combinations don't. Maybe there is a firmware update? Or a keyboard reset method. <comment337733> I've tried to download newest firmware from apple website, but it told me, that i have the newest version already. Also did a reset. I think Im gonna take this keyboard to some apple maintenance shop <comment337737> Good idea. Maybe they can test it with another device and see if the problem persists
