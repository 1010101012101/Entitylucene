Cannot install apps on iOS 6.1.2; can't get through the account security questions <body> I bought an iPad with retina display yesterday, and this is my first iOS device.  After registering and connecting an Apple id, I tried to install some free apps.  But every time I press the codeinstall app/code button, there is a popup saying something like 'You need to setup three questions to improve the security level of your Apple id'(translated from Chinese).   I clicked the codecontinue/code button, then there is a page to choose questions. But when I clicked to choose the first question, it jumps to a blank page and I never see any further response.  But when I clicked the codedo it later/code(translated from Chinese) button, it just quit installing the app.  strongSo neither way can I install an app./strong  I also tried to reset iPad but it still does not work.  The fact is that I already fill the three questions&amp;answers when updating to the current 6.1.2 version. I don't know why it asked me do that again.  What can I do to solve the problem?  strongUPDATE:/strong  The problem magically disappeared this morning and I absolutely have no clue what the reason is.  <answer83522> You should first try reseting the phone.    If that doesn't work, a few people had success in this Apple discussion thread with signing into their account on a different phone that did not have the latest version of iOS on it.   So try signing into your account and setting your security questions from a friends phone. Then of course, remember to log off.   <answer83821> Had the same problem. Doing a reset fixed the problem.  <comment96145> Resetting it doesn't work. <comment96639> Try signing in from another persons device to your account and setting the security questions there.  If the first thing doesn't work, try the second right? :)
