Reverting from Mavericks to Mountain Lion on dual SSD's in RAID 0 <body> So I have my MBP Late 2011 setup with Dual SSD's in a RAID 0 Configuration. Since this is a software RAID, I don't have a functioning Recovery HD and I need to erase the Mac and get back to a stable version of Mountain Lion.  What steps do I need to take to get back to a point where I can install Mountain Lion?  <comment110327> As written it's a bit unclear whether you are asking a question or are providing an answer to another question. In the second case please post directly in the question's answer section (once the restore has successfully run through). Otherwise the question needs some heavy editing to make it more clear what problem you are trying to solve and where you are stuck. Let's close the question FOR NOW to avoid unusable answers. Feel free to request a reopen after editing it into clearer text. <comment110329> I simply wanted to provide information for anyone who faces a similar problem. The restore was successful. <comment110331> Deejay - I'll edit this to be just the question and you can put the answer in the answer section. We like jeopardy questions where one person asks and then answers - **as long as the answer shows up in the answer section**.
