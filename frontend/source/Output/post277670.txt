/usr/libexec/secd – Repeated "Crash reports. What to do...? <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hmWl7.png" alt="Mac Config"img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1SU12.png" alt="Screenshot Crash SECD"  I keep – repeatedly – (like 5 or six times in a row and every quarter hour or even less) – getting the "SECD has quit" message. (sees screenshot)  (I've forwarded the report to Apple – for what that's worth.)  Any suggestions as to what might be causing this and what needs to be done..?  Many kind thanks for anyone who can help resolve this – in "easy language" (I'm not a techie... Just an ordinary "User"... :)  )
