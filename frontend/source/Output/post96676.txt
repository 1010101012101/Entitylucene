Firefox doesn't display Japanese symbols <body> On my system, Firefox doesn't display Japanese characters, for example on the main page of the Japanese Wikipedia. Safari has no problems with this, so what is wrong with my Firefox installation?  hr  After I changed the Serif and Sans Serif fonts for Japanese in Preferences-Content-Fonts &amp; Color-Advances-Fonts to codeOsaka/code from codeHiragino Mincho ProN/code and codeHiragino Kaku Gothic ProN/code, respectively, Japanese symbols are displayed.  In codeTextEdit/code the Hiragino fonts display the Japanese letters fine, so why can't Firefox do it?  <comment113492> Firefox has dedicated font settings for every language. Can you check your settings by going to Preferences-Content-Fonts & Color-Advances-Fonts For:Japanese and check what settings do you have there? <comment113493> @Jozef Legény I had looked there before asking, now looked again to report its contents here, and by the way switched from Serif to Sans Serif. Now it is working, and I can't reproduce a setting where Japanese symbols don't display. On one hand, that's fine (it hadn't worked for years), on the other it's very strange. <comment113494> Serif and Sans Serif are usually just "links" to some other fonts, on OSX Serif usually means Helvetica, on Ubuntu Deja-Vu etc. It could have been that the Serif was pointing to some non-existing font because of some black magic. <comment113512> @Jozef Legény I had an untouched Firefox Profile that didn't display Japanese, so I could investigate further. There, Serif font was `Hiragino Mincho ProN`, Sans Serif `Hiragino Kaku Gothic ProN` and non-proportional `Osaka-Mono`. When I changed the Serif/Sans Serif (makes that distinction even sense for Japanese letters?) fonts to `Osaka`, the letters appeared, and changing one font back to the Hiraginos made them vanish again. Does that tell you something? <comment113550> It won't probably help, but you could try resetting the font cache with `sudo atsutil databases -remove; atsutil server -shutdown`. <comment113555> My installation of firefox uses the Hiragino fonts and the japanese works just fine. Try following @LauriRanta's advice, maybe. Note: Asian fonts can serif-like typefaces, thinner with marked brush end-points.
