The size of the video in iTunes is very small and won't change sizes <body> The size of the video window in iTunes is very small. When I move the mouse over it the mouse cursor disappears. There are no buttons on the window and no context menu appears when right clicking.   I've tried going to Window  Zoom and nothing changes. I've tried going to View  Exit Full Screen and nothing changes. I've gone to View  Video Playback and tried to select "in iTunes window" and "in separate window" but neither change anything. There is another option in View  Video, "Full Screen" but that is disabled.    Obviously, I've restarted iTunes.   How do I get videos to playback normally?   I'm using iTunes 12.3.0.44 and OSX 10.10.5.   <answer208140> Restarting the operating system fixed it. :P
