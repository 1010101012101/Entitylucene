/etc/hosts gets over written <body> What is the correct way of editing code/etc/hosts/code? I want to add some IP addresses and host names to it. It works for a while (a few hours) and then it gets reverted back to the original version. Is there any process checking the status of code/etc/hosts/code and reverting it back?  I'm on my MBA with Mountain Lion.  <answer96707> As a tool to help you find the culprit, here is a dtrace oneliner which prints the pid and name of any process which opens a file for writing, together with the filename:  precodedtrace -qn 'syscall::open*:entry /arg1&amp;3/ { printf("%d %s %s\n", pid, execname, copyinstr(arg0)); }' /code/pre  It needs to be run as root (e.g., with sudo). Pipe it into codegrep hosts/code to avoid drowning in output and missing what you are looking for:  precodesudo dtrace -qn 'syscall::open*:entry /arg1&amp;3/ { printf("%d %s %s\n", pid, execname, copyinstr(arg0)); }' | grep hosts /code/pre  Hopefully, this will tell you what process is overwriting the file. Just let it run in a terminal window until it triggers.  <answer96709> Do you use Cisco's AnyConnect VPN client? If so, you need to edit /etc/hosts.ac instead, and let it copy that to the live file. See this MacOSXHints article, and these previous questions.  EDIT: I can't find anything specifically about Janos Pulse, but Juniper's Network Connect messes with /etc/hosts, and I suspect Pulse may do the same thing. According to this blog post, if you make changes while connected they'll be reverted when you disconnect, but changes made while disconnected will stick.  <answer141563> If you are using Juno Pulse VPN client, code/etc/hosts/code gets over-written by code/etc/jnpr-pulse-hosts.bak/code  <answer262100> For me it's in the file   precode/etc/pulse-hosts.bak /code/pre  You have to edit this file to customize your hosts directives  When you are going to reconnect/connect using the Pulse Secure VPN, it's going to merge the directives from the   precode/etc/pulse-hosts.bak /code/pre  with the content from Pulse directives and creates the   precode/etc/hosts /code/pre  <comment113506> FWIW, this does not happen to me. I have an entry in /etc/hosts to a computer in my private network (address 10.0.0.2) which has never been removed by the system. But perhaps it leaves addresses in local networks (10/8, 172.16/12 and 192.168/16 â€“ see [RFC 1918](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918)) alone, and removes addresses pointing to global IPv4 addresses? `/speculation` <comment113507> Actually, I have added some entries a while back and they stayed. The new ones are getting removed. Both are in similar subnets. <comment113514> Have you been able to determine which process is changing the file? A tool like fseventer might help you understand what's editing the file. Since it's normally owned by root:wheel - the list of programs that can edit the file should be quite small. You could also just set the immutable flag on the file and avoid needing to revert changes. <comment113603> No I'm not using AnyConnect, there's no /etc/hosts.ac either. However, I'm using another proxy software: Junos Pulse <comment288193> I can confirm this behavior with Junos Pulse 5.1.8.  Changes to `/etc/hosts` must be made while disconnected or you'll lose them.
