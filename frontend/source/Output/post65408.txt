Keynote keyboard shortcut for moving focus between slide canvas and slides drawer? <body> In Keynote '09, is there any way to move the focus between the slides drawer on the left side and the main window with the slide itself, without using the mouse or trackpad?  E.g., when I have made a new slide with shift-cmd-N (then this is automatically selected in the drawer), can I start writing in the slide without having to take my hands off the keyboard to use the mouse?  <answer65751> You can set and check keyboard shortcuts in codeSystemPrefrences &gt; Keyboard &gt; [Keyboard &amp; Text Input]/code for the entries:  ul liMove focus to the floating window kbd^ F6/kbd/li liMove focus to the window drawer kbd⌥ ⌘ '/kbd/li /ul  These defaults may vary depending on the keyboard layout and language you're using.  <answer169020> I was going to ask the same thing for Keynote 6 under 10.10, but I'll chime in here instead..  MacLemon's answer doesn't do anything helpful for me in Keynote on Yosemite.  One can switch between Navigator and Slide Only from the View menu (so shortcuts could be created via System Preferences), but:  ul liI can't find out how to leave the Navigator visible but change focus/li liWhen the navigator is displayed, it doesn't get focus :(/li /ul  There's a list of shortcuts here, but I can't find anything relevant..  Maybe an applescript / automator solution could be concocted.  <comment77474> Thanks for your reply. Have you verified that these shortcuts work for Keynote, though? For me they work for other apps, but not for keynote...
