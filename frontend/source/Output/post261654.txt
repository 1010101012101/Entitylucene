Pink line on macbook pro retina external HDMI display <body> Whenever I plug in my external display via HDMI on my macbook pro retina, there is a vertical pink line. It goes away after about 20 minutes, but it's still getting on my nerves. The pink line does not appear when other computers are connected to this display, so it's not the monitor itself. The line does not appear when the display is connected via miniDP (or thunderbolt?) to DVI. Changing the HDMI cable did not fix the problem either. Does this mean there's an issue with my mac's GPU?  <comment327669> What MacBook do you have. <comment327692> macbook pro retina 13. It doesn't matter does it? I'm just wondering whether my GPU is damaged or not. <comment327726> it does matter if you want to know if you have a bad GPU. Some MacBook Pro models have bad GPUs. <comment327751> I have the macbook pro retina 13 late 2013
