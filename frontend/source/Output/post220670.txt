Run Boot Camp Windows10 partition inside VirtualBox <body> I have a separate Windows10 partition courtesy of Boot Camp Assistant.  I would like the option of cranking it up inside my OS X session using VirtualBox, as there are times I would like to use some Windows apps without doing a reboot.  I have found a few guides:  ul liUsing Windows 7 installed in a Bootcamp partition from Mac OS X simultaneously (June '11)/li liUsing bootcamp partition in virtualbox (old; Win7 &amp; Lion, but 2015?comments)/li liDiscussion: MacOS Bootcamp Partition as a VBox Guest (old; 2012/win7)/li /ul  ..but everything is rather out of date, referring to Windows 7.  I wonder whether maybe now the process is simpler?  Could anyone either detail or link to an updated process for Windows 10? (Or alternatively confirm one of the above as a best solution path...)  hr  EDIT: putting up further research as I find it. Once I dig through it all I will upload my findings as an answer.  https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=19866&amp;start=90#p290527 ^ (mid-2014)  http://danielphil.github.io/windows/virtualbox/osx/2015/08/25/virtualbox-boot-camp.html &lt;-- better!

I've started a thread here: https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=75360  <answer229436> Had the same issue and found a solution: just uncheck "Enable EFI" in the VM settings (OS X 10.11.3 / Windows 10 / VBox 5.0.14). Disabling SIP was not necessary.  <answer244303> I followed this guide: http://danielphil.github.io/windows/virtualbox/osx/2015/08/25/virtualbox-boot-camp.html  I did not follow the instructions to disable SIP, and kept EFI mode on. It worked fine.  <answer247661> I also followed the guide at  http://danielphil.github.io/windows/virtualbox/osx/2015/08/25/virtualbox-boot-camp.html  I will add what challenges I had following that guide, but I was able to run my BOOTCAMP partition using VirtualBox, which is free, so I'm happy.  First, you should have installed:  ul liWindows 10 x64 using the OS X Boot Camp assistant/li liVirtualBox 5.0.26 r108824 /li /ul  I also downloaded:  ul liVBoxGuestAdditions_5.0.26.iso (I don't think this is necessary, but I did it just to be safe)/li /ul  As far as Disabling SIP or System Integrity Protection on El Capitan (OS X 10.11), I skipped that part. It was not necessary in my case.  As far as setting drive permissions:  ol liI ran codediskutil list/code to get a list of drives on my system, taking note of the drive number of the drive named codeEFI/code and the other one named codeBOOTCAMP/code, which in my case, the codeEFI/code drive was 1 and the codeBOOTCAMP/code drive was 4./li liI then ran the instructions to unmount my Bootcamp drive and set permissions so that VirtualBox could access the drive. According to danielphil, this needs to be performed each time one reboots.  codediskutil unmount /Volumes/BOOTCAMP/code  codesudo chmod 777 /dev/disk0s1/code &lt;--- This is the drive no. of the EFI disk  codesudo chmod 777 /dev/disk0s4/code &lt;--- This is the drive no. of the BOOTCAMP disk/li /ol  As far as creating the VirtualBox image, the instructions are:     Run the following commands to create a VirtualBox disk image wrapper for your HD. Substitute the 1,4 with the numbers of your EFI and BOOTCAMP partitions as appropriate and put your OS X username in for your_username_here.   Make sure you are in the directory where you want to store the VirtualBox image, or you will have to move it later.   precodesudo VBoxManage internalcommands createrawvmdk -rawdisk /dev/disk0 -filename win10raw.vmdk -partitions 1,4 sudo chown your_username_here *.vmdk /code/pre  As far as creating the VM, the guide was not so clear. Before I followed the instructions from the screenshots, I created a new virtual machine in VirtualBox, checking "Do not add a virtual hard disk".  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FSsJh.png" alt="creating the new virtual machine"  Once created, I selected it and clicked on "Settings". At this point, I followed the screenshots in the guide. The only difference was that:  ul liI did NOT check "Enable EFI (special OS only)"/li liI did NOT have the option to check "Enable VT-x/AMD-V"/li liI used the recommended base memory of 2048 MB, as I only have 8GB of memory/li liIn the "Storage" tab under "Storage Tree", I had to:  ul liclick the "adds optical drive" icon under Controller:SATA to add the "VBoxGuestAdditions_5.0.26.iso" file I downloaded. /li liremove the "empty" image under Controller:SATA/li liSelect the "Add IDE Controller" icon at the bottom/li liclick the "adds hard disk" icon under Controller:IDE to add the vmdk file created/li /ul/li /ul  <comment267118> [VMware Fusion](https://www.vmware.com/products/fusion) does a better job and it's easier then VirtualBox in virtualizing the Boot Camp Partition, however I'd choose to just run Windows 10 as a normal file based VM, not using the BCP.  It's far less problematic in the long run. <comment289455> @user3439894 why is it less problematic in the long run? <comment290382> @ihake, The problem with answering in a comment is the 600 character limit and I could easily go well over that answering that question. Suffice it to say, that I've been using VMware products for over 15 years and in particular VMware Fusion for 9 years, starting with the betas from before version one was release. As such I could probably write a book on it and a whole chapter alone based on my previous comment. IMO, when software manufactures provide product support and also host discussion forums for their product then these conversations are better carried out there, not necessarily here. <comment291336> Did you ever get this working? <comment301070> Welcome to Ask Different.

Just putting that out there. Otherwise, step-for-step, this worked great. Thanks! <comment340367> I've disabled EFI and SIP, but I always get VBoxManage: error: Cannot read the partition information from '/dev/disk0', any ideas? <comment340589> drye, not sure, cuz I'm no expert. If I had to guess, I'd say you're specifying the wrong partition. Mine was `/dev/disk0s1` and `/dev/disk0s4` when I ran `diskutil list` to get my EFI and BOOTCAMP partition. You specify `/dev/disk0` which makes me think that's what's wrong. <comment365081> @drye the problem seems to be related to recent Macbook Pros.
