How do I keep track of the bandwidth usage through my Airport Extreme wireless router? <body> I have 3 Macs, 1 iPad, and 1 Apple TV (using HD Netflix, mostly).  I need to keep an eye on bandwidth usage.  What is the best way to monitor the bandwidth usage (preferably per device) that passes through my Airport Extreme router?  Thanks!  Rob   <answer88200> The Airport Express/Extreme allows monitoring via SNMP if you enable it via the Airport Configuration Utility (version 5.6 ONLY).  Apple removed advanced configuration parameters from Airport Configuration Utility 6.0. Please download a version 5.6 of the utility from Appleâ€™s support page to get a full access to all configuration parameters of your router. strongSNMP configuration/strong is located under strongAdvanced/strong settings.  From there, ANY snmp polling engine can get traffic as a whole.  You would be hard-pressed to find anything that could differenciate traffic between devices that isn't a real router (Cisco, etc) or custom built Linux box.  I just found this during a quick serach: NetUseApp via iTunes Store allows you to monitor any SNMP device with a pretty interface.  <comment245136> If you are running the latest version of OS X you cannot install version 5.6 <comment245137> That is true @nomad33fw  - the installer won't run, but you can bypass the installer and get it to function. Also - it's best to be specific what "latest" means. Some people have pre-release access and as the post ages - latest doesn't mean what it might mean today.
