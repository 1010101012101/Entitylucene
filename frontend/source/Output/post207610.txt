What does file locking do, these days? <body> I'm publishing some files on Dropbox, sharing drafts for public review. Once I get to the final official revision, I'd like to lock it to avoid inadvertent changes. I'm using Pages to write and exporting to PDF for sharing.  Just a minimal safety measure, not about security. Sounds like a job for Finder file locking.  What happens if you use the Save dialog box to try to overwrite a locked file? For the PDF export feature in Pages, it brings up a warning:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6OfSq.png" alt="Sorry for the double size screenshot…"  … eh, the warning is actually only half that size. Anyhoo, clicking "Save Anyway" causes the locked file to be strongdeleted and replaced/strong. The creation date was reset and the lock was removed.  That seems pretty crazy to me. Presumably, Pages wouldn't do this if it was able to get permission to modify the file ordinarily. Is it normal for an app to hack around locking in this way? Should I always bring out the big guns and set the Unix permissions bits if I want any protection at all?  <comment250468> Setting the user immutable flag (lock) can be removed by the owner of the file or the superuser.  At one point the system immutable flag could only be removed in single user mode but Apple reconfigured the kernel so that the flag is removable in multiuser mode. -YMMV <comment250472> @fd0 The flag was never removed, the entire file was. (Not just moved to the trash, either.)
