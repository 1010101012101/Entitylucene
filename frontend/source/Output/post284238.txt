Why I don't see all launchctl daemons/agents with "sudo launchctl list"? <body> I wish to see all launchctl daemons/agents and found How to show all running launchctl daemons/agents?  This doesn't work:  precode&gt; sudo launchctl list | grep -v com.apple. PID     Status  Label -       0       org.postfix.master -       0       org.cups.cupsd -       0       com.oracle.java.Helper-Tool -       0       com.vix.cron 244     0       org.ntp.ntpd /code/pre  I doubt that I have that less Non-Apple launchctl daemons/agents.  for example I have those installed and running:  precode&gt; brew services list Name     Status  User Plist grafana  stopped       influxdb started fyodor /Users/fyodor/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.influxdb.plist mysql    started fyodor /Users/fyodor/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.mysql.plist redis    started fyodor /Users/fyodor/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.redis.plist telegraf started fyodor /Users/fyodor/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.telegraf.plist /code/pre  I don't see them with codesudo launchctl list/code. How to get a complete list?  <answer284652> Your launchctl command only shows 'system' deameon/agents.  That won't include your homebrew daemons.  By experimenting, I discovered these two ways of running launchctl which will do what you want. For simpliciy I have not added your grep command.  To show system daemons/agents:  precode&gt; sudo launchctl list /code/pre  To show user daemons/agents:  precode&gt; launchctl list /code/pre  I like to use LaunchControl by soma-zone which allows me to control/change the agents and daemons as well as displaying them in 5 distinct lists:  ul liUser Agents/li liGlobal Agents/li liGlobal Daemons/li liSystem Agents/li liSystem Daemons/li /ul  <answer284659> Here is a way to get all the codesystem/code and your daemons and agents managed by codelaunchd/code:  precode( /usr/bin/sudo launchctl list ; launchctl list ) /code/pre  Here is a way to get all but the Apple ones:  precode( /usr/bin/sudo launchctl list ; launchctl list ) | grep -v 'com.apple.' /code/pre  Note: to avoid to be trapped into using a fake codesudo/code command (for example from a Trojan horse shell script) always use its full path: code/usr/bin/sudo/code.  <comment358460> `sudo launchctl list | grep -v com.apple.` shows the wanted things on my Sierra - however the ones you show are the only ones that I think are Apple supplied. How exactly does HomeBrew run services? <comment358961> I second the recommendation for LaunchControl.
