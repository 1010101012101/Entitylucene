Customizing Guest Account under OS X Lion <body> I am customizing the guest account under Lion. Several questions here, any feedback is greatly appreciated!  Currently after opening the user panel in sys prefs, some of the settings saved for the Guest Account in the workgroup manager are lost. How do I prevent this from happening?  Is there a way to copy all the settings from an existing regular user account into the guest account? If that's not possible I'd like to define standard settings for the following:    ol liTurning off "natural scrolling" when using the trackpad  /li liTurning off "welcome screens" for Firefox, iWork and others  /li liOS language/li /ol  <answer25373> h2How to Customize the Guest Account/h2  It would probably take me longer to type out how to do it than it will take you to make your changes so I am going to send you to this YouTube video which details the process:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ra9ThVi7zZo  The only thing I would add is that may want to make a backup of the original template.  <answer158724> The technique I use is:  ol liSign into the Administrator account.  Enable "fast user switching"./li liSwitch to the Guest Account./li liSet things up as I like./li liSwitch to the Administrator account.  Copy preferences files as needed./li liLog out of the Guest Account, and back in./li /ol  I do the copying from a 'Terminal' window:  precodecd /System/Library/User\ Template/English.lproj/Library/Preferences/ sudo defaults read /Users/Guest/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dock.plist sudo cp /Users/Guest/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dock.plist . /code/pre  Which copies the current Guest dock to be the system default dock for new accounts.  The Guest account is a "new account" every time it is used.  Here's the magic juice to set 'unnatural' mouse direction for the Guest Account:  precodedefaults write /System/Library/User\ Template/English.lproj/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist com.apple.swipescrolldirection -bool false /code/pre  <comment28425> It sounds like you want to set up a real account named guest and use some product like DeepFreeze by Faronics to keep it the same after every reboot. Customizing the new user creation process is possible, but you'll have to learn the insides of account management. <comment28931> No problem Daniel. If it answers your question would you mind marking this as answered? <comment76119> Is there something easier and more user-friendly? <comment246443> Will this work for FileVault's guest account? (the one that can only run Safari).
