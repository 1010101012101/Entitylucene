MBR-partitioned HDD: How to encrypt Time Machine backup? <body> I'm giving my external HDD to a friend tomorrow for a few days. It's partitioned via Master Boot Record and there are two partitions: a NTFS partition and my Time Machine partition. I don't want him to be able to access the latter, but I can't turn the encryption on because the disk would have to be partitioned with GUID.   Changing the partition scheme would require me to reformat the disk. I can't do this either, as I don't have another HDD to put my files on in the meantime.  Is there another way to encrypt the partition, other than the built-in option of OS X? Or is there a way to prohibit access to the Time Machine partition without any encryption at all?  <answer81215> I think what you could do is creating a strongencrypted disk image/strong on the external HDD and put your time maschine files in it for the timeframe your friend has the disk. To achieve this open the emdisk utility/em tool and choose emFile - New - Blank Disc Image (or Image From Folder)/em.  BUT keep in mind that as long as this disk is not (re-)formatted properly it will be easy to recover unencrypted data which seems to be deleted or moved (using some fancy recovery tools).  <comment93676> Perfect, thank you. I had to remove a bunch of old backups to free some space. Wow, this is really a chore with Time Machine. No problem that the data could be recovered. I'm not assuming he would pry around in my stuff, it's a friend after all. I just don't like the feeling of anyone having full access to all my data.
