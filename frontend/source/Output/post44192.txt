Can I regenerate the the photo thumbnails that have turned black after restoring my iPhone? <body> I had to restore my iOS 5.1 iPhone from iCloud after recieving a replacement. Many of the thumbnails for photographs are now black. Is there a way to regenerate them?  <answer44574> Wait and see. When I looked the following morning, the black thumbnails had all been regenerated automatically.  <answer44580> I may have experienced something similar the other day when my new iPad (3) arrived, and I restored to it from my original iPad (1) backup.  I happened to be in the Photos app (on the new iPad) when I initiated the syncing of my photos.  When it completed, I noticed that all my albums were now there in the Photos appâ€”that none had thumbnails.  Solution (worked for me): 1. quit Photos (tap-and-hold on any icon, wait for the "jiggles" and then tap on the red "x" for the Photos app). 2. re-launch the Photos app.  <comment52258> My thumnails came back overnight. BTW I don't see the (x) on the Photos app at all when all apps are jiggling...
