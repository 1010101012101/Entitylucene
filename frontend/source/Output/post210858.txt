How to transfer Apple Configurator VPP codes to a new OS X account <body> We wish to transfer VPP codes to a new instance of Apple Configurator v1.7.2 (560) on the same Mac computer, just a different user account.  However even after unsupervising the iPads under the old OS X account, the codes are not available for the new one. We hope to use a separate user account for each Apple ID assigned to our iPad carts so that we avoid having to delete and redownload apps for each Apple ID so as to avoid multiple iPad login prompts.
