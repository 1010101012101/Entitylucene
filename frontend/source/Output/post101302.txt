Where are the states of opened/closed folders saved in OS X? <body> I have a windows-server that is accessed from a bunch of computers with OSX, in list mode, if anyone opens or closes a folder, that folder stays open for any other users. I would like all folders to always be closed on the server.  As the server is windows-based I assume finder is saving and reading this info from somewhere, maybe that setting can be changed in finder or that file be removed with a script on the server.  <answer101321> emI presume you are referring to listing a folder using the disclosure triangle in list view:/em  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JzeAi.gif" width="150"  The state of shown/hidden folders in list view of a specific folder is stored in Finder cache, as well as the folder's hidden code.DS_Store/code.  precode. ├── .DS_Store ├── 1 │   └── hello.txt ... /code/pre  You can reset a folder's folder disclosure triangle by running the following command inside the folder that you wish to reset:  precoderm .DS_Store &amp;&amp; killall -HUP Finder /code/pre  <comment119669> Wow, what a great and extensive answer!
