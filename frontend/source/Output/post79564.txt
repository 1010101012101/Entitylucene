External USB DVD drive + Time Capsule (or AirPort Extreme) =? <body> As Apple's more recent laptops (and even the iMac now, sadly) are moving away from internal DVD drives, to use CD/DVDs you must buy an external DVD drive, that plugs into a USB port. But if you need to use it for multiple computers, it can become a problem.  Could you plug the USB DVD drive into the USB port on the back of a Time Capsule or an AirPort Extreme (which both support external hard drives) and access the disk inside it over the network?
