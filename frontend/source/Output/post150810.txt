Disabling the dialogs shown when opening an application for the first time on OSX <body> I am making an app on osx 10.9 using python 2.7. But when it is launched first time, warning comes.     You are opening the application MYAPP for the first time. Are you sure   you want to open this application?      The application is in a folder named Applications. To see the   application in the Finder without opening it, click Show Application.   So, how to avoid this warning. Does I need to make some changes in stronginfo.plist of app/strong.  I had gone through this Q&amp;A but nothing is mentioned about app side changes.  I don't want user to use any sort of command to run or do changes manually. User can disable by code"com.apple.LaunchServices LSQuarantine -bool NO"/code for all or code"xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine Application.app"/code for particular app.  I had also strongsigned/strong the app with developer ID.  So, how to disable this dialog box from popping.  <answer167564> Simply right-click your application and choose "Open".  That immediately gets around Gatekeeper without disabling the feature (which is highly effective at keeping the mac safe from drive-by infections).  <comment177492> `defaults write com.apple.LaunchServices LSQuarantine -bool false` doesn't even disable those dialogs. It only disables the dialogs about opening files downloaded from the internet. <comment177501> Even if it is possible to disable from the user's side, I highly doubt there is a way to override from the application side. That would defeat the purpose of the warning, if it could be set to not show by malicious software.
