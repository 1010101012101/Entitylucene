Cleaning the camera roll from my mom's iPhone 5s <body> I'm trying to clean the gallery of the iPhone, I'm sending the images that I already put in the computer to the trash. But the pics still are in the phone.  I'm an android user, so i don't know if the process is different for iPhone.  <answer234598> You will need to go to the "Recently Deleted" album and remove them as necessary if your iOS version  8.1.  To remove all photos in "Recently Deleted", tap "Select" at the top and then "Delete All" at the bottom.  <comment286974> Great! It worked. Thank you very much!
