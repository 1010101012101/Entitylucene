How to reedit annotations in Preview on Mac? <body> After PDF was annotated, saved and PDF closed I want to reopen PDF but I can not anymore edit it, can not select annotations, arrows. Any workaround?  <answer199137> I am not really sure, but if you could at least open the file with Preview app, there might be an option to revert to previous version from the File menu.   <answer251110> Once you save an image in Preview the changes you have made become part of the image - i.e. they can no longer be edited. However, Preview does store all previous saved versions of a file. To restore an image to a previously saved state (i.e. undo recent changes) choose codeFile &gt; Revert To &gt; Browse All Versions/code. You can then scroll through all previous versions of the image file &amp; choose one to restore. Best analogy of this functionality is the way Time Machine works.   <comment238661> works, but looking for a way to edit <comment238662> Save it after you revert it to a previous version and then try to edit it. <comment238664> but then I loose the changes .. <comment238666> that was not mentioned in your thread, however.... Revert the file, do your changes and unlock the document as mentioned bellow:   1. To lock a document, choose Lock from the pop-up menu next to the document name in the title bar. 2. To unlock the document, choose Unlock from the pop-up menu next to the document name in the title bar.  P.S. If you donâ€™t see the pop-up menu, move the pointer next to the document name in the title bar, and then click the downward-facing arrow.
