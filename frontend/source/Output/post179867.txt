Remove locations from list in Reminders app <body> I am trying to remove the locations listed in my Reminders app on my iPhone 5c (iOS 8.2). I have several that I no longer use/need but cannot work out how to delete them? I have the 'home' one and that's the one I use the most.  I have removed locations within the Maps App thinking this may help, but to no avail. Can anyone suggest another method?  <answer179940> Try this:  ol liOn your iPhone, open the Reminders app./li liSelect the "Home" reminder list./li liTap "Edit"./li liAt the bottom of the list, tap "Delete List"./li /ol  <comment213418> Whilst the device model and iOS version are useful information, the title to your question should be as descriptive as possible regarding what the *problem* is that you are facing. I've edited the title to explain what I believe the actual problem is, but feel free to edit further. <comment235448> Wondering the same, I don't know from where this list came from, it's not the same than Maps favorites, it's not related to IOS frequent location neither... <comment235450> By the way, how I understand the question is: In Reminders, when you set a location based alerts, you get some address already listed. How are they managed ?
