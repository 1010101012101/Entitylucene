How to convert mov to swf? <body> I have a QuickTime .mov file which I want to convert to swf format. Is there any tool for Mac? I already search here for a similar question but couldn't find any. The google search directed me to VisualHub which was discontinued and doesn't support Snow Leopard.   Is there a method using an Adobe CS5 app? If not what are the free solutions out there?  TIA    <answer16785> Never mind. I found an answer on Adobe website. For those who are interested, here is the link.   <answer84192> http://www.videotoflashmac.com/  That's just a simple google search.  You can also use compressor to encode to h.264 and then change the file extension to .flv  <comment21218> If this solved your problem, don't forget to make it as Accepted by clicking the check mark next to it.
