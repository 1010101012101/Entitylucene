Unable to enter Recovery Mode -2006F <body> I'm using a MacBook Air (11-inch, Mid 2013). I recently reformatted and reinstalled the OS via Internet Recovery, but I suspect something went wrong.  Now, when I boot normally, I get the infamous Flashing Question Mark.  When I boot with Alt+Cmd+R, I get the spinning globe with     Starting Internet Recovery. This may take a while   and then:     apple.com/supportbr   -2006F   When I boot with Cmd+R, I get the emexact same thing/em as above. Maybe my Recovery Partition is corrupted, so it defaults to Internet Recovery?  This MacRumors thread Flashing Question mark in folder after start up seems similar to my problem, but the OP is able to get into Internet Recovery, unlike me.  Any suggestions?  <answer274538> Considering you can't boot into an OS, the first things I'd try are resetting the NVRAM and SMC. Below are the steps for doing so, as well as the order you emshould/em do it.  strong1. Reset the NVRAM/strong  Older Macs had what's called Parameter RAM (PRAM), newer Macs use Non-Volatile Random-Access Memory (NVRAM). Here’s how to reset it on your particular Mac:  ol listrongShut down your machine./strong Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out./li liPress the kbdpower button/kbd emand then/em press the kbdcommand/kbdkbdoption/kbdkbdp/kbdkbdr/kbd keys. You have to make sure you press these keys strongbefore/strong the gray screen appears or it won’t work./li listrongHold those keys down/strong until your Mac reboots again and you here the startup chime./li liLet go of the keys and let your Mac reboot normally./li /ol  strongNote:/strong When you log back in you strongemmay/em/strong need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. speaker volume, screen resolution, startup disk selection, time zone information, etc).  strong2. Reset the SMC/strong  Here’s what you do to reset the SMC on your particular Mac:  ol liShut down your computer/li liKeep the MagSafe adapter (power cable) strongplugged in/strong./li liPress at the same time kbdshift/kbdkbdoption/kbdkbdcontrol/kbd (on the left side of the keyboard) strongemand/em/strong the kbdpower button/kbd/li liLet go/li liTurn your computer back on with the power button./li /ol  Once you've done both of these, check to see whether the problem behaviour (i.e. an inability to enter Internet recovery) is still present. Let me know how you go.  <comment345230> Worked like a charm, thanks! <comment345238> I don't know that it's necessary with NVRAM, but on PRAM systems I always hold down command+shift+p+r and let the chime repeat at least three times. <comment345247> No, three time is not needed. Also, the very newst macs don't chime at all.
