Mac Mini 2011 with Dell P2715Q. Trying to upgrade to OSX Sierra. <body> Can anyone please help me out! I was trying to upgrade to the new OSX and it said that I did not have enough memory to install. So I tried to restart and now, my Dell monitor display is half working... the upper half of the screen is working, but the bottom half is not, it just has lines. When I disconnect my monitor from my mini, the screen seems to be working normal. Ugh!!  So I am trying to uninstall the OSX and revert back to El Capitan, but since my screen is half working I can't properly navigate what I am suppose to do. Any ideas???   <comment326541> You will have to clarify your question. At one point you say you couldn't install macOS Sierra, then at another you say you want to revert back to El Capitan? At present are you running El Capitan or Sierra? With regard to your Dell display, have you tested it with another computer? Or have you tried resetting it? Basically it's not really clear if you have Sierra installed and if you're looking for help reverting back to El Capitan or whether you're wanting help with sorting out your display issue?
