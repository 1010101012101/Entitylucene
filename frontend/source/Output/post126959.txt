How can I transcribe a Voice Memo to Text? <body> I need to transcribe Voice Memo recording to text. Can I play the recording and use Dictation? is there another method to convert an existing Voice Memo to text?  <answer126995> I would try using Soundflower, which allows one to virtually plug your sound output to input, and then use Dictation.  <comment148749> My Google Voice does that :) , but it is not very accurate :(
