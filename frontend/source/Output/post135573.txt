VMware Fusion VM resolution not changeable from 800x600 <body> I wondered if I ask this on either Mac community, or that of Ubuntu or else. But I hope Mac is the best one.  On Ubuntu in "Systems Setting" -- "Display", I only see 800x600 resolution option. As I change the size of the VM window, it just expands/shrink accordingly, maintaining the same ratio (800x600) that is way too narrow for me.  Already tried but no good:  ul liOn VM's setting -- "Display", I tried checking both on/off with "Accelerate 3D Graphics" or "User full resolution for Retina display"./li liAdd codepref.autoFitGuestToWindow = "FALSE"/code to ~/Library/Preferences/VMware Fusion/preferences (https://communities.vmware.com/message/2342718)/li liRe-install VMWare Tools (link)/li liUbuntu DEB package open-vm-tools, along with the instruction/li /ul  Any idea is appreciated.  ul liVMWare Fusion 6.0.3 with VMWare Tools installed (via VMWare host)./li liOSX 10.9.3 on Macbook Pro, Retina 15-inch/li liVM: Ubuntu 12.04 64b/li /ul  <comment160690> Try to reinstall VMware Tools if you haven't already. See http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&cmd=displayKC&externalId=1022525. <comment160806> Make sure that Ubuntu **is** using the vmware drivers otherwise it will not work. Any recent release should have automatically autodetected it... <comment160823> As I updated my OP, yeah I already tried re-install VMWare Tools (now I did it again) but no luck (btw what's your account name? It's not really shown). <comment161004> @Vic Could you tell how to make sure that my Ubuntu is using VMWare drivers? I thought about it, but other than installing `vmwate-tools` I don't know how to do so. <comment161642> IsaacS, take a look at this link. http://askubuntu.com/questions/23238/how-can-i-find-what-video-driver-is-in-use-on-my-system
