How to mount nfs drive on macOS with read+write access? <body> I'm trying to mount a drive from Linux on my macOS El Capitan laptop. I try a command like this:  precodesudo mount -o rw -t nfs nfs.subdomain.employer.com:/ifs/home/username /private/workspace/ cd /private/workspace/ echo "hello" &gt; test.txt -bash: test.txt: Permission denied /code/pre  where codeusername/code (the text, not the uid) is the same on my laptop as it is on the server (controlled by my employer). Unfortunately, while I can read files, I'm not getting write access. A colleague of mine said he tried that command from linux as my account and said it worked, but he doesn't know much about macs.  <comment359901> You have to set the permissions on the *remote* computer you have configured the nfs share on.  You need to edit the entry in the `/etc/exports` that pertains to your particular share. <comment359903> Possible duplicate of [How to share directory over NFS from Mac? (w/o macOS Server app)](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/282644/how-to-share-directory-over-nfs-from-mac-w-o-macos-server-app) <comment360023> It looks like that link describes how to mount on Linux from macOS. I want the reverse. Also, as I understand it, my colleague was able to mount the drive on a Linux workstation, so the server is already set up. Does getting write access from macOS require different server settings or am I misunderstanding something? <comment360025> The last time I set up NFS sharing with macOS was a few years ago and from what I remember, there was some settings on the server that I had to configure for `rw` access.  Ever since I switched to SMB2, I don't have any of those issues anymore.
