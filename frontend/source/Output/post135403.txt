Can Mac Mini Support 4k Monitor <body> I'm assembling my workplace and I'm looking into Mac Mini strongMD387LL/strong along with some 4k monitor like this one, Samsung 28-inch UHD.  Problem is that I'm not sure if the Mac Mini will support this humongous 4k resolution. Does anyone has rock solid information on that?  <answer135406> MD387LL has Intel HD Graphics 4000, which uses DisplayPort 1.1, with 8 Gbps maximum throughput. In theory, this could support 4k resolution at 30 Hz em(Edit: or maybe not, see comment below)/em but in practice 4k support generally requires 15 Gbps.  So the answer is: unless you write your own graphics driver, 2560x1600 is the highest you can go.  <answer176652> In fact if your mac mini support multi-monitor configuration (i.e. 2 monitors) and allows spanning your desktop then you strongcan/strong archive strong4k@60Hz using 2 hdmi cables/strong. Samsung UHD has 2 hdmi ports and it supports PBP mode (http://www.samsung.com/hk_en/support/skp/faq/1061869). Samsung UHD monitor emulates 2 monitors (picture-by-picture mode) with resolution (strong1920x2160/strong). As a result one hdmi cable is resposible for left part of the picture, anoher for the right part. I have not tried this on mac but yesterday tested it on PC, going to test on mac on Monday.  <answer207967> strongI can confirm 100% that you CAN in fact get 3840x2160 @30Hz 4K from a Late 2012 mini running 10.10.5 using only one MDP to DP cable./strong I'm writing this using a 2012 Mac mini (Intel HD4000 internal graphics card + 8G ram) with Dell P2815Q 4K monitor. How I achieved this: 1) Used Mini Displayport to Displayport cable that came with the monitor - MDP/thunderbolt from Mac Mini to DP on display. 2) Ran the Mac Pixel Clock Patch for Yosemite: https://code.google.com/p/mac-pixel-clock-patch/source/clones  3) Downloaded and configured SwitchResX, set the resolution, saved and rebooted. Hope the info helps. Enjoy!   <comment160493> It supports this http://support.apple.com/kb/sp597 <comment160550> Yes, sorry. Because [DP 1.1 cannot, even in theory, support 4k display at any resolution.](http://www.anandtech.com/show/7049/intel-thunderbolt-2-everything-you-need-to-know). Additionally, in practice, the default refresh rate is 30 Hz, unless [Multi Stream Transport](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT6008) is enabled on the 4k monitor. <comment160557> possible duplicate of [Can you run a 4k monitor at 30hz with a late 2011 MBA?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/134366/can-you-run-a-4k-monitor-at-30hz-with-a-late-2011-mba) <comment160609> Hmm. [This presentation](http://www.vesa.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/ICCE-Presentation-on-VESA-DisplayPort.pdf#page=18) says otherwise. Perhaps there is a 2x difference between theoretical and actual performance? <comment160615> Removed downvote. That's highly informative, though I can't find where it says otherwise. Under the "advantages" slide, I believe 4K support only applies to DP 1.2 (it's ambiguous in the slides). It's a matter of hardware limitations. 10Gbps bandwidth doesn't provide a large enough pipe to render 4k display @ 30 Hz. Perhaps at 24 Hz, however?? Either way, the conclusion is the same for the OP: not possible. Cheers. <comment160651> @FooBar do you think they will complete the upcoming OSX bundle with those drivers? any information on that? <comment160794> Loomy, I apologize for not being clearer. No, it won't happen. What I am talking about is theoretical, and may well require custom hardware modification. No one anywhere, including Intel, has done it. And Apple would say to just buy a new Mac. <comment250901> Oh that's cool! I'll give it a try! Thanks for sharing ;)
