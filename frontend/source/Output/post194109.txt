Show Google Search in Address Bar in Safari v8.0 in OS Yosemit <body> I'm trying to show/hide google search in Safari v8.0 in mac os "Yosemite" using bash script, I used the following command in terminal but it didn't work even after I restarted Safari, so am I doing something wrong?  precodedefaults write com.apple.Safari AddressBarIncludesGoogle â€“boolean /code/pre  <comment231429> This is similar to the other question you've just posted: The value you want to set/write is missing. <comment231430> Nop, I tried the same solution but it didn't work <comment231432> I think this one disappeared when the search bar & address bar were merged <comment231434> The problem is, that the command is syntactically wrong. So even it the option still would exist, it will not work. <comment231436> @patrix - for sure it would help if it had a value at the end, but in this case it wouldn't magic the function back into Safari ;) <comment231440> @Tetsujin Agreed, but "use `defaults write com.apple.Safari AddressBarIncludesGoogle true`" would currently be a correct (but not very helpful) answer to the question... <comment231453> i'm lost by 'google search'.  Are you trying to change what the default search engine is? or you trying to completely remove the ability to search form the address bar?
