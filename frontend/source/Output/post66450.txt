Mountain Lion - Umlauts with english keyboard layout <body> i have small problems with my keyboard typing umlauts. On Lion i could type umlauts with " followed by the vowel This is no longer possible. The only possibility i noticed is to type  umlauts now by alt+u followed by vowel.   Can i revert this to " + vowel  <answer66452> There are a few means of typing diacritical marks.  h2Input Sources Method/h2  You can enable a German Language layout by opening strongLanguage &amp; Text/strong in System Preferences, going to the emInput Sources/em, and checking the box next to German. This isn't quite the same as your previous set up, but it allows you to quickly type ü, ö and ä with the kbd[/kbd, kbd;/kbd and kbd'/kbd keys respectively. If you check the emShow Input menu in menu bar/em box, you can quickly switch between different layouts, if you want the standard English layout most of the time. The menu also lets you open the Keyboard Viewer, which will show you all the changes of the German layout.  h2Create a Custom Keyboard Layout/h2  If the German Layout isn't exactly to your taste, you can use Ukelele to create a custom layout.  Open Ukelele, and click strongFile → New From Current Input Source/strong to start a new layout based on your current one. To make the kbd'/kbd key be your umlaut key (so that you press it, followed by a vowel to create the character), click the strongCreate/strong button, click the kbd'/kbd key (or whichever key you want; you can add modifier keys if you wish), then in the dialog that pops up, select strongChoose an existing dead key state/strong and select strongState 4/strong. If you want to rebind another key so that you can still type the code'/code character, double click the key you want to change, and change the output to code'/code.  You'll then want to change the name of your layout so you can distinguish it. strongSet Keyboard Name…/strong under the strongKeyboard/strong menu will do this for you. You can also set a custom icon if you want.  Once you've finished with your layout, save it to your the code~/Library/Keyboard Layouts//code folder (or the code/Library/Keyboard Layouts//code folder if you want it to apply for every user on your system). You should then be able to select it in the strongInput Sources/strong section, as above.  h2Other Methods/h2  By default on Lion and Mountain Lion, you can hold down a vowel to get a pop-up menu that gives you the various diacritics you can apply to that letter, like so: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7njUp.png" alt="diacritic pop-up"  You can either click on the one you want, or type the corresponding letter. This functionality is enabled by default, but can be disabled by running codedefaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false/code in Terminal. To enable it, replace codefalse/code with codetrue/code.  The other common method, as you have discovered, is to type kbdoption ⌥/kbdkbdu/kbd, followed by the vowel you want. This works on OS X going back to at least 10.4, possibly earlier.  <answer66458> Were you using the U.S. International - PC keyboard layout? ⇧' enters a dead key state for inserting umlauts in it.  <comment78179> Well, yes, but this considerably slows down the writing flow for German users with English keyboard layouts due to the waiting time for each letter. <comment78181> I added a new method to my answer, it may not be exactly what you're looking for, but it gives you a single key method of typing umlauts. <comment78185> Thats it. i tried US instead of US international. thanks a lot!!
