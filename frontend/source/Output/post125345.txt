Adding page numbers and running head to a pdf file <body> I have several documents that I need to combine into a single pdf. I know that I can do this with Preview. However, it would be really nice if I could add page numbers to the resulting pdf, as well as headers and/or footers on each page.  Is this possible using pre-installed or freely available software on OS X? (Just being able to add page numbers would be great; being able to add a header as well would be perfect.)  I'm using Mountain Lion in case that makes a difference.  <comment146696> Is Adobe Reader out of question? <comment146701> A solution involving Adobe Reader would be welcome. I've just installed it, but didn't see an obvious option to add page numbers or headers.
