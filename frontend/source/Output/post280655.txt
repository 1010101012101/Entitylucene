Strange virtual disk. Delete or leave? <body> I have two virtual disks:  ol liMain macOS disk/li liBootcamp windows disk/li /ol  When I use codediskutil list/codein command line, it shows me:br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0TeyN.png" alt="enter image description here"  So what the code/dev/disk1/code is? Should I delete it? And what is codeEFI EFI disk0s1/code is?br P.S. No fusion drive, only one SSD physical drive.  <answer280658> It's your macOS partition, the physical partition at code/dev/disk0s2/code. i.e. the emphysical partition/em code/dev/disk0s2/code is the emvirtual disk/em code/dev/disk1/code. You can confirm that by running codemount/code in Terminal (or similar) - it should show code/dev/disk1/code mounted as code//code, e.g.:  precode/dev/disk1 on / (hfs, local, journaled) /code/pre  And do not delete it!  EFI is, if I understand correctly, the boot partition.  <answer280675> ol liThe internal virtual disk is a Logical Volume and part of a CoreStorage Logical Volume Group. CoreStorage itself is a logical volume manager similar to Linux' LVM. An LVM is an additional abstraction layer in between hard disks and partitions on one side and volumes on the other side.  In macOS you can convert a partition (e.g disk0s2) with a HFS+ file system lossless to a Logical Volume Group which initially contains several nested items: a Physical Volume, a Logical Volume Family and a Logical Volume. The final Logical Volume is slightly smaller than the original partition, because CoreStorage needs some space to save administrative data.  The Logical Volume contains the data of the previous standard volume/partition and is mapped to its own (virtual) disk device: disk0s2  disk1/li liEFI system partition - Usage - macOS:     On Macintosh computers based on Appleâ€“Intel architecture, the EFI system partition is initially left blank and unused for booting. However, the EFI system partition is used as a staging area for firmware updates. /li /ol  None should be deleted!
