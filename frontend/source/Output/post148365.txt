OSX 10.9.5 automount AFP network volume? <body> I'm having problems getting automount to mount an AFP share at startup.  If I, as a non-root user, issue the following command from my terminal:  precodemount -t afp afp://user:pass@server/share-name ./share-mount-point /code/pre  It works fine, and I can interact with the files.  I'm trying to do the same with automount.  I've added the following to auto_master, and created auto_afp:  /etc/auto_master:  precode /my/global/mount/point auto_afp /code/pre  /etc/auto_afp:  precode /my/global/mount/point -fstype=afp afp://user:pass@server/share-name /code/pre  This fails.  I see that code/my/global/mount/point/code is created by root, in group wheel, but is empty.  When I run codesudo automount -vc/code, the same thing happens.  I get output like codeautomount: /my/global/mount/point updated/code but there's no AFP share mounted there.  I'm not even sure where to start debugging here.  <answer148376> OK, I figured it out.  The keys in the codeauto_afp/code file are paths that are relative to the path specified in the top-level codeauto_master/code file.  So if your code/etc/auto_master/code has: codemy/global/mount auto_afp/code  Then your code/etc/auto_afp/code should have: codepoint -fstype=..../code  Finally to get visibility into what codeautomountd/code is doing, add codeAUTOMOUNTD_TRACE=2/code to code/etc/autofs.conf/code, watch code/var/log/system.log/code with codetail -f/code, and start navigating around your mount points.  <comment174857> This actually is a valuable addition to the questions/answers on this site (and it documents a trap other users might run into as well). So if you don't mind we would like to keep the question around for future visitors. If you don't agree, just delete it again and we will respect that with no bad feelings.
