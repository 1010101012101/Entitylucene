PS: Only other such post I found is this for an iPad which does not cover the specific quantities &amp; detailed numbers I am asking, nor is it asking for iPhone, nor the change/ shift of these numbers thru iOS versions.   <comment255899> The only change I'm aware of from iOS 7 to 9 is that iPad folders are now 4x4 in iOS 9, rather than the 3x3 grid of iOS 7 and 8. Are there more changes? <comment255901> [This post](http://ipod.about.com/od/usingios4/f/Iphone-Apps-Iphone-Folders.htm) has some data for iOS 7 that you may find useful. <comment255913> I was hoping to get clearview on how Apple has changed these numbers from 7 to 9. Thanks though. <comment255915> I knowâ€”in my first comment, I said that I think the only way these numbers have changed is that iOS 9-running iPads can how have 4x4 grids. That's all, unless you count iPhone screen size changes in that span.
