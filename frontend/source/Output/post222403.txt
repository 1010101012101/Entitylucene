Apple Time Capsule won't extend wireless network <body> I am running a Wifi network with a fritzbox 7360 and all my apple devices (apple tv old and new, MacbookPro, mac mini, iPhone, iPad) can connect just fine. Recently I bought apple time capsule 3TB which won't join my local wifi for unknown reasons. I ran several resets, checked configuration and read all I could found on the internet. Connectivity and placement seems fine as well (I checked with other devices).   Below are my settings. Can somebody help?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gDSc5.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sHe3J.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer222440> Joining and extending WiFi networks is only supported with Apple devices. The TC won't join your fritzbox WiFi. You can cable it in however and it'll function as a backup device.  <comment269654> Possible duplicate of [Why won't my Time Capsule extend my wireless network?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/98738/why-wont-my-time-capsule-extend-my-wireless-network)
