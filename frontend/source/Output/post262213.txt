Serious Delete Bug (File re-appears after getting deleted) <body> Just bought my first Mac (Pro) and there is a bug I'm facing. There is a folder in my trash which is not getting deleted. It pops an error saying a file is already in use.  I have tried immediate delete, rebooted the system, tried force delete from the terminal and nothing is working. However, after rebooting, I am able to delete the file but on next reboot file re-appears somehow. What's wrong?  <comment328497> Is it possible some program is auto-opening something in the folder (or auto-creating it if it doesn't exist)? <comment328529> would be useful to know what the folder is, where it came from & what the perms are on it [& secondary, exactly which Mac & what OS it's running - especially as you said Mac Pro but you've tagged it macbook, which is a totally different machine] <comment328639> You also tried secure delete? And what app is it related to? <comment328658> The file actually doesn't exist. It says "Pokemon Indigo League Episode 1" is already in use when I try to delete it (or immediate delete), I renamed the folder to "m" but it's still undeletable from trash. No antivirus, all I have is FCP and adobe AE on my mac. Nothing fancy. The original location of that file is my external hard-disk (magnetic tape) and I actually never deleted that file in the first place. What could be the reason, I am worried. Thanks
