select all the text in a iPad Pages document <body> is it possible to select strongall/strong the text in a emPages/em document with a simple action?   If so, how?   if not, is there any trick to change the font in all of the paragraphs in a document?  <answer190653> Touch your finger anywhere on the document and hold for a second. Then remove your finger and a pop-up menu should enable you to "Select all".  <comment226643> No holding needed if you touch on an empty spot of the page.
