How to use Hungarian tax reporting application called ABEVJAVA on Mac? <body> I have installed Hungarian tax reporting software called ABEVJAVA. I put into my home folder. Then for test it I downloaded a report template called NAV_1408.jnlp On windows I have to double click it, and after that in ABEVJAVA a new item will appear to use the new report.  But on Mac I can not double click it. I tried to run run jnpl file from terminal with JAVA like this below, but I get an error. What can I do now to get it work on Mac?  precodeKs-MacBook-Air:~ kukodajanos$ java /Users/kj/Downloads/NAV_1408.jnlp  Error: Could not find or load main class .Users.kj.Downloads.NAV_1408.jnlp Ks-MacBook-Air:~ kukodajanos$  /code/pre  <answer150269> I couldn't run by double clicking the JNPL file. Other way needs: right click + Open With + JAVA WEB START  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4PL75.png" alt="enter image description here"  I found it in the manual on NAV's website: http://nav.gov.hu/data/cms126069/sugo.pdf  You can look up the 'Mac' keyword.  <comment176873> What version of Java? <comment176875> java version "1.7.0_60"
