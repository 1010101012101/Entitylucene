Does OS X's terminal app support mouse? <body> According to this answer over at SuperUser, OS X's terminal app should use Alt+Mouse Click to send mouse events to applications running in the terminal. I tried that with the Midnight Commander, but it does not work. I am running OS X Mavericks.  Is there any way to enable mouse support in the terminal app, short of switching to iterm2 or something like that?  <answer113153> Indeed, OS X Terminal strongcan/strong receive mouse input through ⌥-clicking:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RhyM2.gif" width="290"  However, certain Terminal apps don't receive the passed mouse input.  hr  You can install strongMouseTerm/strong which will pass mouse events to the terminal.     ul   liMouse button reporting./li   liMouse scroll wheel reporting./li   liSimulated mouse wheel scrolling for programs like codeless/code (i.e. any fullscreen program that uses application cursor key mode)./li   liTerminal profile integration (with preferences dialog)./li   /ul   It's a SIMBL plugin, so you'll need to install SIMBL to make it work. I recommend installing EasySIMBL instead though.  <answer176080> iTerm 2 supports all mouse interactions out of the box.  <answer195340> At least in Terminal.app 2.6 enable "Allow Mouse Reporting" in menu "View" gives mouse support in Midnight Commander.  <answer214190> As of OS X El Capitan 10.11, Terminal supports strongMouse Reporting/strong. You configure application programs to enable it. For example, in Vim use codeset mouse=a/code.  Terminal supports reporting three mouse buttons and a scroll-wheel, along with Shift, Meta, and Control modifiers. The Option kbd⌥/kbd modifier key maps to Meta (regardless of the “Option is meta” keyboard preference). You can use kbd⌘/kbd-Right Click for mouse-button three on a two-button device (which also works for “middle-button paste”, which invokes strongEdit  Paste Selection kbd⇧⌘V/kbd/strong when Mouse Reporting is not active).  You can use the kbdFn/kbd modifier key when clicking, dragging or scrolling to temporarily bypass Mouse Reporting and interact with the terminal view. You can also use the strongView  Allow Mouse Reporting/strong menu item to bypass it for longer periods of time or when kbdFn/kbd isn't available.  <comment132794> What do you mean by "short of switching"? I'd recommend you to switch to iTerm. There is a SIMBL plugin provided by [this](http://superuser.com/a/595284/169617) answer. So I'd say, the answer to your question is no(why would they code a plugin, if there is native mouse support ;)) <comment132841> EasySIMBL plus MouseTerm works! Awesome. <comment207795> Yes see the accepted answer (or test it on your machine) <comment207800> Suburb! When knowing these kind of tricks makes live so much easier. <comment207809> Only a very limited amount of mouse interactions are supported with Terminal.app. iTerm2.app handles them all. <comment238401> **Allow Mouse Reporting** does not enable Mouse Reporting, it _allows_ programs to enable it using terminal commands. The purpose of this menu item is to temporarily disable MR so you can interact with the terminal view. To enable MR you must configure whatever program you want to use it, e.g., in ~/.vimrc, ~/.emacs, ~/.nanorc. You can also temporarily interact with the terminal view by pressing and holding the kbdFn/kbd modifier while clicking, selecting or scrolling with a mouse or trackpad. <comment258554> As of OS X Yosemite 10.10, Terminal has built-in support for “Simulated mouse wheel scrolling for programs like less…” This can be controlled via **Preferences  Profiles  [profile]  Keyboard  Scroll alternate screen”; it is on by default. <comment265795> As of OS X El Capitan 10.11, Terminal supports Mouse Reporting. <comment307608> Dude, I'd like to buy you a beer.
