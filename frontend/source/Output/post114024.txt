Magic Mouse Gesture not working OS X Mavericks <body> I am using Magic Mouse with my iMac having OS X Mavericks 10.9.   Everything was working fine since today morning, I realized that my Magic Mouse is only responding to scrolling and primary, secondary click. All other gestures of Magic Mouse were not working.   And another issue which I don't know it is related or not is that Google Chrome does not scroll. Restarting Chrome fixes problem for 2-5 minutes but not permanently.  I use all gestures frequently for spaces, zooming, swapping, navigating, etc and I am having very difficulty without these features.  Things I have tried:  ol liChecking/Resetting Magic Mouse settings from system preferences/li liTurn Magic Mouse on and off/li liDisconnect/Connect Magic Mouse/li liRestart iMac, press power button and "command+shift+p+r" and from troubleshoot screen, verify/repair Disk Utility (OS Disk)/li liConnect mouse with other iMac (mouse is fine)/li /ol  After all these things, problem still exists. I have searched it in Google and I have found out that many people have received this problem but I couldn't find any solution.  Does anyone here know about this issue and have some solution??  <answer168882> I solved the same problem by going to mouse in preference and unblocking the gesture the second and third gesture leaving only the "Swipe between pages" enabled.  <answer201699> Disable the gesture and the re enable it again...  <answer242869> had the same issue and called apple.  Reset your PRAM. Fixed the issue for me. Google for how to reset PRAM.  <comment298885> What makes for a good answer is when you provide the instructions on how do the procedure you recommended so readers don't have to go look up outside Ask Different.   - It's no longer called PRAM, by the way; it's NVRAM
