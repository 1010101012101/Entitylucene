How do I address an object value in a whose clause in AppleScript <body> I am trying to test a object property of elements in a whose clause.  For example, let's use the common elements "document" and "window" that almost every Mac app has:  precodetell application "TextEdit"     get document 1 --&gt; document "Untitled"     get window 1 --&gt; window id 40640     get document of window 1 --&gt; document "Untitled" end tell /code/pre  So we see that window 1 has a document property that points back to a document element.  Now I like to find all documents that are in window 1 (please don't question the sense of this - while it makes little sense in this particular case, I need the solution for a different case where it's actually useful). I try this:  precodeset theDoc to document of window 1 --&gt; document "Untitled" get every window whose document is theDoc /code/pre  But that fails with the error strongemCanâ€™t make document into type reference. number -1700 from document to reference/em/strong.  How do I solve this without resolving to a loop command (repeat), but staying with the codewhose/code clause?  <answer238232> Use codeits/code or codeof it/code, like this:  precodetell application "TextEdit"     set theDoc to document of window 1     get every window whose its document is theDoc     -- or --&gt; get every window whose document of it is theDoc end tell /code/pre  <comment292050> Have you tried using Accessibility Inspector to see the hierarchical relationship of the various objects all well as the information it exposes?  I find that this can be very helpful in the formulation of a statement. <comment292066> I am using Script Debugger's Explorer, which is superb for this job
