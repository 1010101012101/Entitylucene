2 instances of Xcode installed? <body> I originally installed Xcode via Apple's developer website (not through the App Store). Later on, I installed Xcode via the App Store.  Now in Launchpad, I have two icons for each of these apps: Xcode, Instruments, Dashcode, and Quartz Composer. None of the icons have an "X" button to remove them from Launchpad.  Questions:  ol liDoes this mean that I have 2 versions of Xcode installed?/li liIf not, how can I verify that I only have one version installed?/li liHow can I know which file each Launchpad icon is referencing?/li liIf it's purely a cosmetic thing, how would I get rid of the second set of icons? (And does it matter which set I get rid of?)/li /ol  Update:  I see that the code/Developer/code folder contains an codeApplications/code folder, but it also contains codeSDKs/code, codeDocumentation/code, codePlatforms/code, etc.  My code/Applications/code folder contains the folder codeDeveloper/code. Inside of code/Applications/Developer/code, there are 4 aliases which link to the code/Developer/code folder. For example, the Xcode alias (code/Applications/Developer/Xcode/code) links to code/Developer/Applications/Xcode.app/code.  <answer47692> The old version of Xcode used to reside in /Developer whereas the current version has been moved to the standard /Applications.  Consider checking both locations for the program.  It is safe to delete the /Developer folder if you have the current version installed.  <answer47719> If you have the latest Xcode (4.3.2 at time of writing) it should be in /Applications/Xcode. You may have an older Xcode in /Developer. /Developer is now no longer used by Xcode. You should remove it using the provided script if you don't need the old version any more. Execute   precodesudo /Xcode4/Library/uninstall-devtools --mode=all /code/pre  and authenticate. When that script completes you can remove the /Developer folder entirely but you should allow Xcode's script to take care of its somewhat "fragile" installation first.  New Xcode lives in /Applications and is much more like a conventional Mac OS X app these days. Lots more information about putting it in the dock, finding other developer apps, command line tools etc. in this other answer of mine.  <answer55712> 2 Xcode versions can co-exist on a mac, we use it in our company for checking backward compatibility. Till date, we have never faced any issues because of this.  <comment54635> I wouldn't trust Launchpad. Try typing "Xcode" into Spotlight instead. <comment54640> Delete the entire `/Developer` folder? It seems like that would get rid of everything. I updated my question to clarify. <comment54642> Sounds like your system has been modified.  XCode 4.3.2 definitely installs to `/Applications/XCode.app` and ignores any existing `/Developer/` folder.  Just to be clear, a path beginning with '/' is in the root of the hard drive. <comment54644> Yes, I'm following the same convention of `/` at the beginning refers to root. Perhaps it's because I originally installed it through Apple's website rather than the App Store. I guess the solution I would prefer at this point is to uninstall everything and reinstall via the App Store. <comment54657> Don't delete the /Developer folder - run the script and let it uninstall itself first. Most times on a Mac I agree you can just trash the folder but not this time. <comment64233> Can you elaborate on how you installed two Xcode versions in parallel? <comment64304> just install it in two different folder locations . My old version is in /Developer and latest Xcode in /Xcode.
