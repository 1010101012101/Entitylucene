Move item from iCloud keychain to normal keychain <body> Is there any way that I can move an iCloud keychain item, in particular an internet account, to a normal keychain? Moving items between keychains usually works with drag and drop, but I cannot drag an item from iCloud keychain to another keychain. I can start dragging, but the items then disappears from my cursor. I am also happy with a command line solution.  I am using OS X 10.11.2 (El Capitan).  <answer220089> From comments, it appears Apple may have forgotten to include drag &amp; drop - or maybe it's intentional…  Either way - you can right click Copy, then change to the Login keychain &amp; right click Paste.  You can then delete the original.  You will need to re-grant access to Safari by inspecting the item [double click] selecting the access tab &amp; adding Safari to the list of programs.  <comment266306> The site works best when there is only one question per question — please limit your question to one main question and ask the others separately if you are unable to find an answer. <comment266313> You can right click copy, then change to login keychain & right click paste [I'm not going to try it because I don't want to mess things up]. Presumably you could then delete the original. <comment266314> Thank you @Tetsujin, that works! So Apple just forgot to implement drag and drop correctly. <comment266315> Glad it worked, let me quickly drop it to an Answer... <comment266317> Just a note: you have to re-grant access to Safari by inspecting the item (double click), selecting the access tab and adding Safari to the list of programs. <comment266318> Ah, OK, thanks. I'll add that to the answer.
