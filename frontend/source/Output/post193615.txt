CPU usage for User tasks consuming up to 80%; 0% Idle. What does it mean? <body> I have noticed that my CPU usage is always near 100%.  0% of it is for Idle. About 20% average is for System tasks. The rest is going to User tasks (80%).  But if I look at individual tasks don't see anywhere near the 80%+ usage reported.  What is actually using this CPU?  Is it actually misreporting Idle?  I feel like this CPU consumption is at least partially real because my macbook is very sluggish.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HZamn.png" alt="enter image description here"  I've tried checking codetop/code but the results are similar.  precodeProcesses: 196 total, 3 running, 5 stuck, 188 sleeping, 797 threads                                                                                                                            12:29:46 Load Avg: 9.63, 11.46, 13.58  CPU usage: 81.27% user, 18.72% sys, 0.0% idle  SharedLibs: 15M resident, 9044K data, 0B linkedit.
