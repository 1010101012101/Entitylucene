Upgrade from Windows 7 to 10 using VMware fusion 8.0 <body> I'm having difficulty (=it doesn't work) to upgrade from Windows 7 to Windows 10.    This is the situation:  I use a 2011 MacBook Pro running OSX 10.10.05 and VMware fusion 8.0.0 (I have it set to run W10 x64)  Currently W7 is installed all up to date  When I use the normal upgrade procedure (clicking the icon in the right bottom corner) it tells me my SVGA is not good enough and I don't have enough memory (I've got 4GB allocated to VMware).  Yes it had to be SVGA.  I have tried the solution that VMware suggested, but that didn't work. I've mounted the .iso W10 file from my Mac and from a USB stick.  I'm not sure what the difference is between running W7 in a VM and boot-camped W7 through VMware fusion.  What else can I try and do to upgrade?  <answer208043> Since SCGA is the Southern Californian Golf Association and the only score (which may be too low) to post is obviously related to your handicap, I assume you misspelled SCGA and meant SVGA instead.  The following article: Upgrading to Windows 10 using Software Update in Windows 7 and Windows 8/8.1 virtual machines fail with the error: Unsupported SVGA driver (2126929) at vmware.com should solve your problem.  emTo preserve readability I don't quote the article./em  hr  strongDetails/strongbr Upgrading to Windows 10 using Software Update in Windows 7 and Windows 8/8.1 guests fails You see the error:  Unsupported SVGA driver  strongSolution/strongbr This issue occurs because, in certain circumstances, the Microsoft validation tool used to assess a systemâ€™s readiness for Windows 10 misrepresents the capabilities of the VMware SVGA drivers, preventing the upgrade.  Note: The issue affects all virtualization platforms, including those not from VMware.  To resolve this issue, upgrade the virtual machine:  Note: VMware recommends to take a backup before upgrading the guest operating system in the virtual machine.
