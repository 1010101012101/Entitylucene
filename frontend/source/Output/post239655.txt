Applescript with get every file loop fails <body> I want to run a script on all files with two specific extensions on a disk with a hierarchy of multiple nested folders.  My script works fine when I choose a folder further down the line with fewer subfolders but I'd like to run it on an entire archive with over a thousand folders.  The AppleScript takes forever to codeget/code all the files and then exits without returning anything and without executing the operations after getting the files.  No timeout message, no error message.  And the Finder becomes unresponsive (and remains stuck after the script exits).   precodeset myFolder to choose folder with prompt "Choose a folder:"     tell application "Finder"         try             set eafFiles to (every file in entire contents of myFolder whose name ends with ".eaf") as alias list         on error             try                 set eafFiles to ((every file in entire contents of myFolder whose name ends with ".eaf") as alias) as list             on error                 set eafFiles to {}             end try         end try         try             set pfsxFiles to (every file in entire contents of myFolder whose name ends with ".pfsx") as alias list         on error             try                 set pfsxFiles to ((every file in entire contents of myFolder whose name ends with ".pfsx") as alias) as list             on error                 set pfsxFiles to {}             end try         end try         set myFiles to eafFiles &amp; pfsxFiles     end tell      repeat with CurrentFile in myFiles         set CurrentFile to CurrentFile as string          do shell script "perl /path/to/perl/script.pl " &amp; quoted form of CurrentFile     end repeat /code/pre  <answer239672> Perl's File::Find is ideal for iterating over all the files in a folder. This approach deals with one file at a time, is fast, and memory efficient.  Use AppleScript to present the folder choice and then pass the selected folder path to your perl script:  precodeset myFolder to choose folder with prompt "Choose a folder:" do shell script "perl /path/to/perl/script.pl " &amp; quoted form of POSIX path of myFolder /code/pre  The perl script can then deal with traversing the files. Below is sample perl script for iterating over files and filtering to only codeeaf/code and codepfsx/code suffixes:  precode#!/usr/bin/env perl  use strict; use warnings;  use File::Find;  # Get the first argument passed to the script my $argument_path = shift; die("ERROR: an argument must be provided\n") unless $argument_path; die("ERROR: the argument must be a folder: $argument_path\n") unless -d $argument_path;  # Iterate over every file and folder within the $argument_path find sub {      my $filename = $_; # relative to current working directory      # Skip all but .eaf and .pfsx file types     return unless $filename =~ /\.eaf$/;     return unless $filename =~ /\.pfsx$/;      print $filename."\n";      # ... deal with the file or folder here  }, $argument_path; /code/pre  <answer243317> Try using System Events instead of Finder. I was trying to get every file of a particular extension type in a folder, and kept getting script errors.   codetell application "System Events"/code  continue with the rest of your code.   Hope this helps!  <comment294205> What are you trying to do with the files you find? A _bash_ script might be a more efficient way to go. <comment294209> I pass them to a perl script via `do shell script "perl " & quoted form of perlScript & " " & quoted form of CurrentFile` â€” I bet there is a better way to do it but my scripting skills are pretty much confined to applescript.
