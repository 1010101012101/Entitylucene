Running flash on MacBook Air V1 <body> I run applications that use Adobe Flash.  This causes my MacBook Air (1st generation) to heat up and end up becoming unusable.   Someone suggested running flash after creating a new Windows Partition, because Mac OS-X does not support Flash very well.  Will it help to run Flash that way?  <answer8846> It's actually Flash that does't support OS X very well.  But simply running Flash can't make your MBA so hot, what kind of applications are you using with Flash that demand such huge heat-ups?  You could try installing a Windows partition, but I suspect that it won't lessen your problem.  I think your problem are the applications oyu are using with that laptop, as it doesn't have active cooling and can't handle too much CPU/GPU heat.  <answer8867> I have found that Parallels and VMWare are painfully slow on a 1st gen MBA. You could use Chrome when you need Flash as it runs a browser-specific instance of Flash rather than calling the system Flash instance. Flash is very CPU-intensive so it may very well heat up the machine more than normal â€” I seem to recall mine always being pretty hot on the bottom.  John Gruber has a great article on removing Flash from OS X and then just using Chrome when you need it here - http://daringfireball.net/2010/11/flash_free_and_cheating_with_google_chrome  <comment9357> Will using active cooling pads solve the problem? <comment9361> @Jon It might work, though usefulness of cooling pads is highly contested. I'd recommend you try a cooling pad from a friend or ask the shop if you can try it out before you buy it. <comment9388> +1 for Gruber's article. I did this to all of my Macs and I noticed they all perked up a bit. I really didn't want yet another browser to use, but I also didn't need Flash enough to justify having it available all the time at the system level. <comment9403> I have actually not missed it much and I don't mind launching Chrome every once in awhile. <comment9423> Agreed.  Flash really is a timewaster, and chromium is my work browser.  Sadly I've been hearing the fans again on gmail pages.
