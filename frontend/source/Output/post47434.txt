Alternative to iTunes for managing videos? <body> I'm getting tired of fighting with Apple's iTunes to get it to play my non-iTunes media. I've tried the 32-bit trick, and MOV files I remove from the library and add back no longer show up in the codeMovies/code or codeTV Shows/code categories, so that trick fails, as well.  Every time there's an update, Apple breaks support for AVI, MP4 and — most recently — MOV files not purchased from Apple's iTunes store. So what alternatives to iTunes exist that manage to support a mix of media that Apple now seems to go out of its way to break?  <answer47435> When it comes to iTunes alternatives, I can think of three or four worthy alternatives.  strongAudirvana:/strongbr A free, open-source tool which supports many formats and will allow you to upsampling for no cost at all.  strongClementine:/strongbr Free source as well, a multi-platform player which is more of a music organizer and is pretty snappy.   strongSongbird:/strongbr It's like the anti-iTunes and will provide everything you expect from a music player.   strongEcote/strong:br It will cost you $8 in the MacApp Store, but it's worth it! It's very iOS-like and it integrates perfect with Mac OS X.   Although it will cost you some money, I strongly recommend Ecote!   <answer55618> There's Usher, by ManyTricks, for $35. I haven't used it myself, but it looks great and follows iTunes/iPhoto's design principles. I trust ManyTricks to make a good app: they're behind my favorite window manager, Moom.  <comment55990> I am not looking for music organizers, but iTunes-like applications which manage video media (as well as music). <comment63834> This looks interesting, I'll check it out. Thanks.
