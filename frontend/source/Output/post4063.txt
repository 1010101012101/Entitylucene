What does "iTunes err = -3259" mean? <body> I am downloading some iTunes U content in iTunes and am getting   precodestopped (err = -3259) /code/pre  on a number of the downloads.  I was hoping to find a list of err codes, but no luck.  Found a lot of forum posts for other error numbers, but not that one.    Any help?  <answer4065> As I search some I find that it happen because of antivirus:     What seemed to work for me was   disabling anti-virus software during   the load process. I killed my   antivirus and then hit refresh on all   of the podcasts that failed with err =   -3259 and they all finished successfully.      Long term I think we need to get apple   to resolve this issue, but in the   meantime you can temporarily disable   your anti-virus, complete your   downloads and then bring the   anti-virus back up.   And some where said that it because parental control:     Some of our users are reporting that   unchecking Podcasts from the Parental   Controls preference pane has resolved   the issue. For some of our customers,   simply going into: Edit - Preferences   - Parental Control and unchecking Podcasts   <answer4073> I turned off "Allow simultaneous downloads" and now it is consistently downloading without a problem.    <comment3862> It wasn't parental controls or anti-virus.  I disabled the "Allow simultaneous downloads" and now it works fine.
