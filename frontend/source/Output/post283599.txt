Can't record audio with Macbook + Earbuds <body> I have a 2013 MacBook Pro Retina and I always used the EarBuds to talk on skype etc.. Suddenly it stopped working as the Audio Input. I still can listen to stuff, control the volume and everything else. The only problem is that It stopped capturing the microphone. I didn't change anything recently and this is how my sound settings are:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NjjbR.png" alt="enter image description here"  Can you give some tips on things to check? Thanks for any help  <answer283621> If you have not already, I would do a restart and as part of the restart clear the non-volatile RAM (NVRAM):   Hold down kbdCommand/kbdkbdOption/kbdkbdP/kbdkbdR/kbdall at the same time starting before the first system boot chimes and letting them chime 3 times before releasing.   Worked for me when that happened.  <comment357691> I just tried, it didn't work. Any other suggestion? <comment357698> try a different set of headphones / microphone... <comment357700> It was the first thing I tried. I thought my mic was broken, but it is not the case.
