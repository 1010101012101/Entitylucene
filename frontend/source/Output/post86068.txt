How can I play a .drv file <body> I received several .drv files recorded from a security system's cameras. The disc provided to me includes a player called "GenAVplayer.exe" and a filed named "player.bin" which when expanded contains .dll files, I assume various codecs for the player. Does anyone have any suggestions as to how I can play these video clips on my Mac?  Thanks in advance.  <answer86069> You could try running GenAVplayer in wine, and opening the files in that.  <answer86070> I would recommend either MPlayerX or VideoLAN. Both are freely downloadable and support a variety of audio and video codecs. If you're emlucky/em one might just work!  <comment105317> As it turns out, I was not lucky with that disc. But VideoLAN did help me with another similar disc.
