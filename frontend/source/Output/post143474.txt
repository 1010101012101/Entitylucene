How can I run iTunes without installing Bonjour in Windows 7? <body> I just checked my Windows error logs and Bonjour has caused a ton of errors.  After reading about Bonjour and not needing the networking services it provides, I deleted it.  Now when I open iTunes, an error message appears saying that there is a problem and that it has to close.  Other posts (1, 2) seem to imply that iTunes can run without Bonjour.  How can I get iTunes running on my Windows 7 machine without installing Bonjour?  <answer143487> This article is a little stale but it worked for me awhile back...  http://www.zdnet.com/blog/bott/the-unofficial-guide-to-installing-itunes-10-without-bloatware/2390  <answer143521> not sure if this is what you are looking for but I have, on occasion, done a standard iTunes install and then gone into Programs and Features and uninstall Bonjour. That and Apple Software Update show up as separate items for installation.  What it then leaves behind, I am unsure of. You used to be able to run regmon and watch installs to see what it installed so you could then rip it out by the roots later. But I gather that it is no longer supported. Not sure if Process Monitor will do the same thing.   <comment169063> Just out of curiosity, why do you want to?
