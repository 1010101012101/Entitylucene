Problem with alert setting on Iphone since 9.0.1 update <body> Problem with calendar alerts since I updated to IOS 9.0.1- When I enter or edit an event in Calendar I was getting a problem where when you selected a first alert (say 1 day before) then selected a second alert (say 2 hours before) they would sometimes switch order. You could then select them again and they would be stay in the correct order. Now when you choose a second alert time it becomes the time for both alerts and there is no way to correct them. I tried with the default alerts set to None and to 1 Day doesn't make any difference.  <answer212051> I was able to duplicate this issue on iOS 9.0.2, and these steps worked for me:  ol liTap "Second Alert"/li liSet it to "None" (at the top)/li liTap "Second Alert" again/li liSet it to the desired time./li /ol  <comment255990> Same on 9.0.2?
