Finder spotlight tool not "grepping" through all file types? <body> We've got this development stack that's mostly javascript, and if I'm looking for a variable definition or something I can use Finder's spotlight tool to easily find the file that contains the variable I'm looking for.  However if there's something I'm looking for that I know is in a JSON file, Finder won't return anything.  I looked through Finder's preferences as well as Spotlight's but couldn't find anything about extensions.  Does anyone know a fix for this?  Or maybe an alternative to Finder/Spotlight?  Thanks in advance  <answer87231> You can use Bare Bonesâ€™s TextWrangler (from the makers of BBEdit). It has a emMulti-File/em Search function that is easy to use and pretty useful.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GveU7.png" alt="TextWrangler screenshot"  Nice: TextWrangler is free.
