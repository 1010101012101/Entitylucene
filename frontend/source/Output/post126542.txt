Registering Excel on iPad, when iTunes and Microsoft account emails differ? <body> I have an Office 365 Home Premium subscription, and so I wish to use the subscription-based features of Excel for iPad.  The problem is that I use different email addresses for my iTunes and Office 365 subscriptions.  This is the series of steps I've followed:  ol liInstall Excel for iPad/li liRun Excel for iPad/li liSelect "Buy Office 365 Home"/li liSelect the tiny "I Already Have a Subscription"/li liEnter my iTunes Store password, for my iTunes email address/li /ol  I then get the error message:     "No Subscriptionbr    This Apple ID doesn't have a paid Office 365 subscription."   For my two different email addresses, the domain names are the same, but the account names are specific to the two products - as an anti-spam measure, and to make it easier to detect phishing messages.  I considered changing my Apple email address to be my Microsoft one, or my Microsoft email address to be my Apple one. But in both cases, I would have a large number of login details to change, on multiple programs on multiple devices.  strongAre there any other alternative solutions, such as adding a second email address to either my iTunes or Microsoft accounts?/strong  <answer126544> After days of looking, I've found the answer, via  Having Problems Activating Office for iPad? Here’s a Simple Solution  Briefly:  ul liInstead of saying “I already have a subscription”, choose the Read-only option/li liThen click on the strongActivate/strong button at lower-left/li liThen you have an option to activate by using your Microsoft Office 365 account credentials/li /ul  For me, doing this in Excel also activated my Word and PowerPoint iOS apps.  <answer135235> Hey I had the same issue with my computer. I wasted my time on it for  many days but finally I got a solution from this link  http://www.microsoftliveassist.com/activation-problems-with-office-365/﻿﻿  <comment186778> I don't even get the "Activate" link. I still have "Go Premium" and it never changes. As such all of the responses of this ilk are useless to me. The number of "closed" issues nothing to see here for this bug is disturbing.
