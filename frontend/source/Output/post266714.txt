How can I synchronize the shell view and Finder view of a directory? <body> Using the shell, I opened a tar file that was full of db dumps that were compressed with bzip2. For each dump file, I (1) unzipped, (2) loaded, (3) deleted.  From the shell, the directory where I worked looks perfect. Using emFinder/em, the directory view has frozen on what the directory looked like immediately after I untarred. None of the changes caused by code~/WorkArea/bzip2 -d *dmp.bz2/code or code~/WorkArea/rm *dmp/code are reflected. Also, mysteriously a directory titled codeDisk1/code is now viewable in emFinder/em. That directory was never viewable in the shell.  Trying to move or delete any file with emFinder/em in that directory gives abr codeThe operation can't be completed because an unexpected error occurred (error code -1407)/code.  How can emFinder/em get synchronized with the work I did in the shell?   <answer266715> This is a known quirk with Finder; it's supposed to refresh automatically, but sometime it's won't.  Unlike Windows, there is no refresh button nor can you press F5 to refresh the window.  There are more details and workarounds to this in the article Refreshing Finder Windows in Mac OS X.  However, I find that the easiest thing is to just go up one directory and then back.    If you use Keyboard Maestro, you could create a "refresh keystroke" of sorts by mapping a key combo to something like kbdCommand/kbd kbdShift/kbd kbdA /kbd and then kbdCommand/kbd kbd[/kbd which will take to you the Applications Folder then back to where you were.  <comment334455> Going up / down in Finder created 3 more "Disk1" directories. "Disk1" is disk that has OSx installed on.  All 3 are empty, and I don't see them in the shell. I'm too nervous about what is happening to my file system, so I'm just going to reboot. <comment334458> The re-boot fixed the Finder view. Thanks for the info and I'll use it to keep a closer eye on my shell work. But, if my boot volume gets mixed-up in the problem I'm gonna re-boot.
