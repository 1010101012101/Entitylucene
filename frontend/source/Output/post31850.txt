Cannot connect to server "localhost"? <body> I've been developing web apps for several months now on my mac using the built in apache server and everything has been fine. I restarted my mac this morning and now when I try to connect to anything on localhost I get the error: "Could not connect to localhost". Here are some things I have already checked:  ul liApache is running. System Preferences-Sharing-Web Sharing is turned on./li liI ran "apachectl configtest" and it returned "Syntax OK"/li /ul  Any help would be appreciated.  <answer31853> I can recommend MAMP. It's everything you need in one software-package. Apache, MySQL and PHP. I use it for years and I never met a problem!   <answer41185> From the terminal codecurl http://localhost || echo $?/code might be a good place to start to determine if this is a resource issue, routing issue or apache issue.  You'll either get back a valid http response or an error that may lead the way to knowing why your other web clients are not connecting to localhost on port 80.  <comment36512> This says nothing about the question <comment36513> What happens if you ping localhost and what is ib console(as an admin user)? <comment36516> 64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=19 ttl=64 time=0.076 ms <comment36530> No true, but it will solve Groppe's issue never the less... <comment36573> Why - as apache is still here and runs with firewalls in exactly the same way <comment46624> Is this something you ever figured out or are you still in need of help in answering? <comment46703> I actually no longer use the machine in question, so I don't need assistance any longer.
