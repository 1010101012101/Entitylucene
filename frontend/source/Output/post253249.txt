MacBook (13-inch, Late 2009) only boots up to Apple logo with little spinning wheel <body> Using single-user mode, I get this message:     launchctl: Please convert the following to launchd: /etc/mach_init.d/dashboardadvisory.plist   What does it mean and how do I convert launchctl to launchd?  <answer253253> This is your one and only hope that I know of.  strongLogin Single User Mode and to repair a disk/strong  Boot the Mac into Single User Mode by holding down kbdCommand/kbd+kbdS/kbd during system boot.
