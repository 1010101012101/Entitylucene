Keyboard layout editor that works on Lion <body> So far I've been using Ukulele for editing my keyboard layout (I assigned some shortcuts to Alt+key and changed a few others). Unfortunately, after upgrading to Lion, it's broken.  The point is, Lion changed behavior of pressed keys -- they don't repeat, apart from punctuation that does.  But I can't fix it, since Ukelele apparently uses some PPC program.  Is there any other keyboard layout editor for Mac?  <answer23091> A possible alternative is  http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?item_id=keylayoutmaker  but I have never tried to use it myself  <answer48755> I use KeyRemap4MacBook, it works on Lion. It's a preference pane.  <comment29415> Ukelele should work just fine on 10.7. Lion's press-and-hold behavior shouldn't depend on the keyboard layout or affect Ukelele. If you just want to disable the popovers, `defaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false`. <comment33318> I maybe able to recommend an build-in fix if only I knew what your trying to accomplish <comment33319> Well, I didn't like characters that were assigned as Alt+letter, characters on the key on the left from 1 (I wanted it to be ` and ~), layout of keys on keypad (it was =/*-+ and I wanted it to be /*-+=) and decimal point key on keypad (it was . and it should be ,). So I cloned "polish pro" keyboard layout and made changes I wanted. Now, in Lion when you press and hold a letter, you see all versions of this letter with different diacritic marks. I don't see it, on my changed layout. So, I wanted to clone default keyboard layout once again and made my changes to it once again, but I can't. <comment55858> thanks, but Ukulele now works fine.
