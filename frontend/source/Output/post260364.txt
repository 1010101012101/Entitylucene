Using launchd to update MacPorts <body> I want to use launchd to update my MacPorts tree periodically (i.e. codeport selfupdate/code.  I have created code/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.macports.selfupdate.plist/code:   precode$ ls -l /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.macports.selfupdate.plist -rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel  669  8 Nov 12:49 /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.macports.selfupdate.plist /code/pre  It has the following contents:   precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict&gt; &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt; &lt;string&gt;org.macports.selfupdate&lt;/string&gt; &lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt; &lt;array&gt;     &lt;string&gt;/opt/local/bin/port&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;string&gt;selfupdate&lt;/string&gt; &lt;/array&gt; &lt;key&gt;StandardOutPath&lt;/key&gt; &lt;string&gt;/var/log/org.macports.selfupdate.log&lt;/string&gt; &lt;key&gt;StandardErrorPath&lt;/key&gt; &lt;string&gt;/var/log/org.macports.selfupdate.err&lt;/string&gt; &lt;key&gt;RunAtLoad&lt;/key&gt; &lt;true/&gt; &lt;key&gt;StartInterval&lt;/key&gt; &lt;integer&gt;604800&lt;/integer&gt;&lt;!-- 1 week --&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  I've loaded it and verified that it's loaded:  precode$ launchctl list | grep macports -   78  org.macports.selfupdate /code/pre  But it doesn't look like it actually run.    precode$ port info wireshark Warning: port definitions are more than two weeks old, consider updating them by running 'port selfupdate'. wireshark @1.12.8_3 (net) ... /code/pre  What am I missing?  <answer260405> You probably put the plist in ~/Library/LaunchAgents/. Since /opt/local is owned by root:wheel (that's at least the default), you don't have the proper permissions to write to certain necessary folders (e.g. /opt/local/var/macports/sources/rsync.macports.org/release/tarballs/tmp). The log files (i.e. /var/log/org.macports.selfupdate.log/err) neither can be created, because only root can write to /var/log/.  So run the selfupdate service as launch daemon:  ul liRemove the launch agent from the launchd database:  precodelaunchctl remove org.macports.selfupdate /code/pre/li liMove the plist to /Library/LaunchDaemons/:  precodesudo mv ~/Library/LaunchAgents/org.macports.selfupdate.plist /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.macports.selfupdate.plist /code/pre/li liModify owner and permissions:  precodesudo chown root:wheel /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.macports.selfupdate.plist sudo chmod 644 /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.macports.selfupdate.plist /code/pre/li liLoad the daemon:  precodesudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.macports.selfupdate.plist /code/pre/li /ul  Such launch daemon is run with root permissions and can update MacPorts data as well as write to /var/log/.  <comment326040> It was actually in `/Library/LaunchDaemons`.  Isn't that where it should be?  In the meantime I'll check my permissions. <comment326041> @StephenRasku Did you launch the daemon initially with `sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.macports.selfupdate.plist`? What does the selfupdate error log/selfupdate normal log reveal? <comment326044> I did launch it that way.  I didn't see any logs when I did it.  I just re-did it and added diagnostics and it looks like `rsync` is not connecting to the proxy for some reason. <comment326045> I just ran a `port install` command from the command line and that failed too.  I didn't have that problem before.  I'll take a look at it in the morning. <comment326046> @StephenRasku The file /var/log/org.macports.selfupdate.log should at least contain **some** details. I have tested this in a VM (first in ~/Lib/LaunchAgents/, then as a launch daemon in /Lib/LaunchD.../. The first attempt failed of course - the second wrote some lines (i.e port's version etc) <comment326047> It does have some details.  It's complaining about the proxy right now.  I've recently been messing with my network configuration so that could be affecting it.  I think this is probably an additional problem not the original problem. When I ran it the first time it didn't create the log files but when I went back to it they were there, timestamped about 4.5 hours after I loaded the job. <comment327376> It turns out it was the only problem.  I had a guest network in a VM that was interfering with the proxy setup.  Thanks for your help.
