iPad screen broken, cannot unlock - need to backup <body> I have an iPad Mini, the screen has broken and is unresponsive. Although the device is still on and getting notifications.  I need to backup the device and download photos, but cannot do this until the device is unlocked using the passcode.  How can I unlock the device without the screen working?  Or how can I back up the device even if its locked?  <answer163511> Since you cannot unlock your iPad, you wont be able to backup your device using iTunes. When you have iCloud backup enabled for your iPad, it will automatically make a backup when you plug in the power cable. The iPad normally does this around midnight I think.  When none of the above works and you have access to a windows computer, you can download your photo's from your iPad using the windows explorer program.  I don't know if this is also possible with iPhoto since I didn't try that.  <answer169594> I was able to connect and browse the filesystem by connecting my iPad via USB to a computer running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. The photos and videos were in the DCIM folder.   !img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WeXRu.png" alt="picture of the Ubuntu filesystem"  <comment191500> Windows explorer works even if it's locked? <comment191522> I think it does, but only for your photos <comment213296> thanks @dwightk for trimming my answer so neatly! Could you pls correct 'brows' to 'browse' (my typo).
