geany on OSX with clang, how to config so that hello world runs? <body> Consider the simplest c++ code:  precode# include &lt;iostream&gt;  int main()  {     std::cout &lt;&lt; "Hello, world!" &lt;&lt; std::endl;     return 0; } /code/pre  In the macbook, if I type codeg++ test.cpp/code and then code./a.out/code, then the "Hello, world!" greeting successfully occurs.   When I try to use an IDE such as geany, I got the error:  precode/var/folders/_c/s57qkn5d7qjdvr0h3srm9s000000gn/T/geany_run_script_VEE72Y.sh ; exit; /var/folders/_c/s57qkn5d7qjdvr0h3srm9s000000gn/T/geany_run_script_VEE72Y.sh: line 7: ./test: No such file or directory   ------------------ (program exited with code: 127) Press return to continue /code/pre  What is the problem? I remembered that I can successfully compile and run the code in geany when I codebrew install gcc/code, but I don't want to use brew to install gcc, since in the command line the file compiles and runs fine.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/A1sdo.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment367994> Your output from geany shows what happens when you try to execute the program - it states that the program file "test" is not there. You need to detail what Geany says when you try to compile and build the program.
