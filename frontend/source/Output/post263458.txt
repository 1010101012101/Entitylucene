How do I add a custom alert sound in macOS Sierra? <body> strongHow do I add a custom alert sound in macOS Sierra?/strong  I've made some sounds I want to use in a variety of applications but when I try to add them to the em/System/Library/Sounds/em folder, it says emThe operation can’t be completed because you don’t have the necessary permission./em  I also get the same message trying to add myself to the permissions on the Get Info window.  <answer263460> Copy the sound file to code~/Library/Sounds/code, which is in your Home folder not code/System/Library/Sounds/code in the emroot/em of the Macintosh HD. The sound file will then show in strongSystem Preferences/strong  strongSounds/strong  strongSound Effects/strong for you to select as the emalert sound./em  Note: To expose the strongLibrary/strong folder within your strongHome/strong folder, click strongFinder/strong  strongGo/strong  press the kbdoption/kbd key and select strongLibrary/strong.  strongUpdate to address comment:/strong  First you need to disable strongSystem Integrity Protection/strong.  ol liReboot the Mac and hold down kbdcommand/kbdkbdR/kbd keys simultaneously after you hear the startup chime, this will boot macOS into Recovery Mode/li liWhen the strongmacOS Utilities/strong screen appears, click the strongUtilities/strong menu, at the top of the screen instead, and choose strongTerminal/strong./li liType the following command into strongTermina/strongl then press kbdenter/kbd:  precodecsrutil disable /code/pre/li liYou’ll see a message saying that System Integrity Protection has been disabled and the Mac needs to restart for changes to take effect/li liReboot the Mac./li /ol  After copying the file(s) to code/System/Library/Sounds/code you'll need to enable System Integrity Protection using codecsrutil enable/code following the steps above.  With strongSystem Integrity Protection/strong disabled, then to copy the sound file(s) to code/System/Library/Sounds/code you'll needed to use codesudo/code with codecp/code in strongTerminal/strong.  Example:  precodecd /System/Library/Sounds sudo cp /path/to/custom_sound.aiff . /code/pre  Note that is a code./code at the end of the emcommand/em, so as to copy the file into the current directory. You'll be prompted for an Administrator password when using codesudo/code and when you type the password you'll not see any response as the typing of the password is hidden.  Just type the password and press kbdenter/kbd for the command to execute.  <answer271468> From Apple level 9 user - an easy answer and fix for some reason not out on the net...  Open a Finder window, hold down option key and click GO.... GOLibrarySounds (double click to open sounds- the folder will be empty if you have not added any personal sounds) then drag and drop .aiff sounds.   <answer277622> On macOS Sierra   You don't have to disable anything! /Users/&lt; username /Library/Sounds/_______.aiff It should be empty. Drag and drop your .AIFF file there then open System Preferences/Sounds, then click the Sound Effects tab, and it should be there.  <comment330065> I should have mentioned above that I have the sounds installed for me but I want them installed so every user will use them.  That's why I was trying to copy them to the system's sound folder. <comment330073> Okay I have **System Integrity Protection** already disable and why the file copied just with `sudo` so I've added instruction to disable/enable **System Integrity Protection**. <comment330144> Thanks for your detailed response.  I will try it out but I have at least partially disabled SIP already so I can use TotalFinder.  I have to go back and reread their directions so I don't mess something with Total Finder which is working for me.  Thaks much though, <comment341243> What exactly is an "Apple level 9 user?  That's a new one.... As for your answer, you provided nothing that wasn't already provided. <comment371623> @Allan Probably an Apple Forums level 9 user (which is the highest level AFAIK) <comment371662> Security concerns notwithstanding, I would leave SIP off. You'll probably need to replace the sounds again after installing updates, and redoing the whole SIP rigamarole will get old.
