How can I restrict a Service context menu item to appear only when certain text is selected? <body> I am trying to figure out a way to have a Service show up in a context menu when text is selected, but if and only if that selected text is a URL.  The Automator Service in question will take the selected text and then save it to my "Reading List."  Safari has em"Add To Reading List"/em in its default context menu. But I exclusively use Google Chrome on my Macbook Pro. So, what I've been doing for nearly 2 years now is I manually copy the URL to  the clipboard, open Safari, and add the URL to my "Reading List" manually.  Is there a way to restrain a context menu item for a Service so that this context menu item only appears if the selected text begins with "http" (for example), so that I don't have one more unnecessary item cluttering my context menu?  <answer270552> Never mind, I figured it out.  The following is automatically presented at the top of the Automator window when a Service is created:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/R7cCD.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment340004> If you exclusively use Google Chrome, then why have you been adding URLs to the Reading List in Safari? <comment340005> For iOS devices. I use Safari on iOS devices. <comment340014> To whomever down-voted this question, care to offer an explanation as to why?
