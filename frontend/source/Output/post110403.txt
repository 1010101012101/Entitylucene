Multiple IP addresses in Safari <body> Is it possible to choose which IP address will be used to browse the web? I am connected to a VPN which created tun interface with different IP addres so now I have two of them.   I would also like to browse the web through the second one, the tun interface.   <answer110514> Yeah, I found the answer.. If you're using VPN via OSX Network settings, there is a setting under Advanced button to "Send all traffic over VPN connection". If you're using OpenVPN with Tunnelblick, the same "Route all traffic hrough the VPN" is under strongSettings-Advanced-While connected/strong.  <comment130044> Yeah, I found the answer..
