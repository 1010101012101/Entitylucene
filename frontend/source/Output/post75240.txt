Is there an iPad whiteboard that can also be used on desktop machines? <body> I've seen many iPad whiteboard apps but all seem to be either iPad only (eg Whiteboard Mojo) or are read-only from the web (Jot) or require local connection via wifi (splashtop) or make you pay for every Internet session (whiteboard HD). I don't mind paying for the app, but I want to use this for business, and nickel and diming per session isn't going to work. (How would people get reimbursed?)  So I want an app I can buy once and use for as many Internet whiteboard sessions with other iPads and desktop machines as I want.  <answer75253> This seems like it would be a good solution for you.
