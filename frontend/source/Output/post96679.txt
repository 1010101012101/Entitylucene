I keep getting an error on RedLaser app for iPod Touch 4th generation. How to fix? <body> I just downloaded the RedLaser app from the App Store on my iPod touch 4th generation, 6.1.3.  If I go to launch the app, it goes to the Scan section and works normally for about 5 seconds.  Then, no matter what I'm doing within the app, I get this error.  Please see the screenshot here:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dUFDp.png" alt="enter image description here"  Plus, whenever I tap "OK", the error comes back.  It won't go away at all. So, how can I fix this error so it goes away and doesn't come back?  <answer96697> kCLErrorDomain is error reporting regarding the OS framework "Core Location." See this document for more info (written for OS X, which iOS is based upon).  So, for troubleshooting, I'd check your location services, maybe disable them/re-enable them and relaunch the app.    If that doesn't work, try re-downloading the app.  If the issue persists after a reinstallation of the app, the next step I would try would be to restore your device.  <comment113516> Since I don't have enough reputation, it wouldn't let me post the following: If the issue persists after setting your device up as new, time to visit the Genius Bar.  See here for instructions on how to set up an iOS device as "new": http://support.apple.com/kb/ht4137 <comment113594> I turned off Location Services for the app and I am no longer getting the error.  Thanks!
