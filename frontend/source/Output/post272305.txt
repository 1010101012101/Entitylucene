Why Does My External Hard Drive Only Shows Up On My Desk Top But Not In Finder <body> I purchased a new external hard drive and it shows up on my desktop, but it does not show in Finder under Devices. I made sure it is not hid and I went to Finder  Preferences  Sidebar and under Devices made sure External disks was checked. I can open the hard drive from the desktop, but do not know why it does not show in Finder under Devices. Thanks for your help.  <comment342274> What happens if you drag it from the Desktop to the Sidebar under Devices, does it stay in the Sidebar then?
