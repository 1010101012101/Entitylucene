iPod app won't delete <body> My Facebook Messenger app will not open, and when I click it nothing happens. It will not let me delete the app. My iPod was updating the app for over a whole day and nothing was happening, as I am in Thailand at the moment with very bad Internet. I tried to delete the app so I could reinstall it. However, nothing happens, and now it remains shaded grey and says 'waiting' at the bottom.  <answer247881> Go to Settings  General  Storage &amp; iCloud Usage  Storage: Manage Storage  Scroll down until you find Facebook Messenger. Touch it. Touch "Delete App."  Once it has been deleted, you can reinstall it.  <comment305857> Go to the Facebook Messenger app's page on the app store, then click the `Stop` square to stop the download and remove it from your iPod.
