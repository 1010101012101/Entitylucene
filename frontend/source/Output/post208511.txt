Modify router port-forwarding rules from Terminal <body> I'm trying to modify my router's NAT Table / Port-forwarding rules using the terminal on my Mac. My current setup looks something like this  precodePublic  &lt;-&gt;  Internet  &lt;-&gt;  Modem + Router (1.1.1.1)  &lt;-&gt;  Macbook (192.168.1.2) /code/pre  There's a webserver / app running on port 7919 on my Macbook and I'd like to port-forward it so anyone can access it publicly from the internet. Specifically, I want code1.1.1.1:7919/code to forward data to code192.168.1.2:7919/code.  I know I can do this by going in to the Router settings web interface, or using other GUI apps such as PortMap, but I need to do this using the command line.  I've been searching for a solution for hours and still haven't been able to find a simple solution that does this for me. The closest I came was to codenatd/code, but it has been deprecated in favor of codepfctl/code, and I can't make any sense of it.  <answer208544> After searching for hours, I still wasn't able to find a built-in command-line utility that does what I'm asking for. But I did find something else that's pretty close. It's strongPortMapper/strong, a java applet that comes with a command-line interface to manage the port-mappings of your router (must be UPnP compatible).  Since my plan was to do everything from the terminal, I'll walk you through the steps:  pre class="lang-bsh prettyprint-override"code# Download the latest version curl -fSL "https://sourceforge.net/projects/upnp-portmapper/files/latest/download" -o portmapper.jar  # See the basic help java -jar portmapper.jar -h  # List all port-forwarding rules java -jar portmapper.jar -list  # Create a new rule java -jar portmapper.jar -add -externalPort 7919 -internalPort 7919 -ip 192.168.1.2 -protocol tcp  # Delete a rule java -jar portmapper.jar -delete -externalPort 7919 -protocol tcp /code/pre  hr  emThis assumes you have java installed and available in your shell/em
