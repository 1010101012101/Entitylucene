Application to copy SMS messages from Sony Ericsson Bluetooth-equipped phone to Mac? <body> What application could I use to copy SMS messages from a Sony Ericsson Bluetooth-equipped phone to a Mac?  I previously used BluePhoneElite 2 for this. But it no longer seems to be able to read the messages on my phone and its development has been discontinued. The developer suggests Phone Amego as an alternative. But at first glance that doesn't seem to reproduce this feature. Is there any other Mac application I could use? If not, does anyone have any experience doing this with a Windows application on VirtualBox?
