Migrate iTunes from Snow Leopard to Lion <body> I have a Mac Pro with 3 hard drives in it - Windows XP, Snow Leopard and Lion. I have been using the Snow Leopard one as my startup drive and working from it. It's about time to move to Lion and I'd like to take the iTunes library with me, it is used for streaming to my Apple TV, lots of my play lists are based on play counts etc. How can I do this? Migration Assistant won't work as it can't see the Snow Leopard drive, it's not actually in another computer. Copying the iTune library files has given me some odd results as well, does anyone have any advice?  <comment82877> Migration Assistant will work. You are probably choosing the wrong source. Can you post a link to a screenshot of the beginning of the Migration Assistant Wizard after you make the choice? <comment97917> duci9y, sorry about the extremely late reply but I didn't actually get notified that someone had responded but thanks anyway.I have solved this problem now but couldn't use the Migration Assistant to do so. When in Lion the Assistant cannot see the copy of Snow Leopard so can't perform the migration. I used the iTunes library files to make the migration, copied them and used them in Lion. <comment97926> That's weird. MA should have seen the SL drive. Anyways, good that you solved the problem. :) <comment97927> I assume that it's because the copy of SL is on the same Mac Pro. Whereas I can see the SL files I can't run SL alongside Lion, the assistant needs what it thinks is the old computer to be running... <comment97929> You don't have to run SL alongside, the presence of  a disk is enough. The disk should be valid and bootable though.
