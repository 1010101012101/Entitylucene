Identify whether an icon represents a package or file <body> There are some way to know, by the icon, if it's a package (like a .app) or a single file? I'm talking about some app or config that adds a flag in the icon, or something like that.  <answer82966> Open the Finder.  In Finder's preferences go to 'Advanced' and tick 'Show all filename extensions'.  After you do this if something is an application it will have a .app after it's name.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uNXme.png" alt="Screenshot of the preference + its effects"  <answer82978> Control- or right-clicking a package in Finder will show the context menu item codeShow Package Contents/code.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YuDdI.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment95662> But apps are not the only packages. <comment95725> The problem then becomes being computer literate enough to be able to tell which extensions refer to files, and which to packages ;)
