Would it be possible to create a folder action that can push timed Notifications? <body> Specifically I'd like to attach a folder action that would pass to the Notification center a timed alert that would go off after 60 days... possible?  <answer66869> Enable codeat/code:  precodesudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.atrun.plist /code/pre  Add a Run Shell Script action that uses terminal-notifier to display a notification:  precodeat 2 months &lt;&lt;&lt; 'terminal-notifier -message "some message" -title "title"' /code/pre  Replace codeterminal-notifier/code with code/Applications/terminal-notifier.app/Contents/MacOS/terminal-notifier/code if you've installed it by downloading the application bundle.  codenow+5 &lt;&lt;&lt; 'say a'/code would run a command in five seconds. You can list scheduled commands with codeatq/code and remove them with codeatrm/code. See codeman at/code for more information.  <answer68618> OK so as it turns out I found the answer to this. I just needed to edit my existing attached applescript. And here is is with the proper formatting in place:  precodeproperty myList : "Invoices"  on adding folder items to this_folder after receiving these_items     repeat with this_item in these_items         set fName to name of (info for this_item)         if fName does not start with "." then -- avoid new todo for .dsstore files or something similar              set startTime to (current date) + 60 * days             tell application "Reminders"                 make new reminder at beginning of list myList with properties {name:fName, due date:startTime, remind me date:startTime}             end tell         end if     end repeat end adding folder items to /code/pre  <comment78750> What sort of action are you trying to make happen? <comment78751> I want to set a 60 day reminder automatically. So, 60 days after I save or move something to the folder (with the folder action attached), a reminder notification would pop up. <comment79015> Thanks for your reply but that's a bit advanced for meâ€¦ Could you possibly break it down a little for me? <comment79041> I edited the answer. You could also use [launchd](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/40705/monitor-a-folder-for-changes-and-run-a-command-when-a-change-is-detected) instead of folder actions. <comment79202> I got a little help and figured out how to modify an existing applescript I had already attached. I just needed to change a few terms. So the updated script now is: cont. <comment79204> Oh crap...no way to save the formatting...
