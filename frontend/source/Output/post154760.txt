GCC : Command not found <body> I'm very new to Mac and right now my operating system is 10.10 Yosemite. I installed XCode and Xcode CLT, gcc came along with it as well.  I was asked to change the default compiler to gcc. I went online to this question here to find out how to do it -  How to set gcc 4.8 as default gcc compiler  and these were the instructions I chose to follow (They seemed pretty straightforward) -   precodecd /usr/bin  rm cc gcc c++ g++  ln -s gcc-4.8 cc  ln -s gcc-4.8 gcc  ln -s c++-4.8 c++  ln -s g++-4.8 g++ /code/pre  But the problem is that now when I type codegcc/code it says Command not found. Why is that?  When I codecd /usr/bin//code and codels/code I can see gcc, cc, g++, clang etc.  It basically says the same message 'command not found' for these commands - codecc/code codegcc/code codec++/code and codeg++/code  (I was wondering why the instructions above mentioned to rm those 4 but this answer has been provided in multiple places so it must be correct.)  clang still works thankfully, although I still require gcc.   I also used codesudo port install gcc49/code to get gcc4.9 and I assumed it would have installed it perfectly, but I still get the same gcc error.  Can anyone give me a step wise procedure on what I should do to get gcc, cc, g++ and c++ working again?   Again - Mac newbie here. Please be kind :(  <answer154770> If your filesystem is case sensitive, then you probably meant to enter stronggcc/strong instead of strongGCC/strong  <comment182067> $ gcc --version <comment182079> I apologize for the mistake in the question I posted. I used lowercase only. <comment182080> @Buscarì›ƒ This is the output I still get -   -bash: gcc: command not found <comment182081> do you need to install the command line tools ? http://osxdaily.com/2014/02/12/install-command-line-tools-mac-os-x/ <comment182082> I already installed it. Does the environment variable have to be added to bash manually? Not that I know how to do that either. :\
