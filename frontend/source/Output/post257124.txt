iMac Fails to boot once after update to Sierra <body> So this is a bit of a strange issue.   I work as a regional field IT manager for a large newspaper company. My team and I recently upgraded one of our sites to new iMac systems, and we took the older ones back to our corporate office. My manager wanted us to play around with them, specifically with Sierra, to see if it would be viable for us to upgrade more people to them.  These iMacs are the mid-2010 21.5-inch models, and the one in question has the following stats:  h2CPU/h2  ul li3.06 GHz Intel Core i3/li /ul  h2RAM/h2  ul li4GB 1333 MHz DDR3 /li /ul  h2Graphics/h2  ul liATI Radeon HD 4670 256mb/li /ul  Once I updated to Sierra, and the machine rebooted, a loud tone sounded for about 3 seconds, followed by the Mac trying to boot to what looked like recovery mode. The other iMac that my manager was working on did the same thing, but with El Capitan. After a few reboots, the machines started up as normal, albeit much slower.  What exactly happened here? We thought we had bricked these machines, but they were fine after a few more reboots.   <comment320964> I wouldn't recommend running Sierra on 4GB of RAM.
