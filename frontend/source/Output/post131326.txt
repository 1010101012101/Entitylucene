iphone app suggestion for taking low resolution photos <body> I need to take low resolution photos on iPhone5 like at 640*480, 320*240 etc. Low resolution photo is so that they can be uploaded easily. Default camera application is not allowing to change resolution. After some googling it appears there is no trick with out apps to do it.  So, any free, light weight, iOS app suggestion for taking low resolution photos with emrear cam/em ? Only requirement is to take low resolution photos. No photo editing capability is necessary.   <answer131353> Did you look at Simple Resize which seems to do what you are looking for.  <answer131359> The lowest I have seen is by using Camera+ by emTapTapTap/em, which offers an "optimised" quality setting allowing for a maximum width/height of 1200 in the longest direction.  Others may shoot lower than this, but I am not aware of any specifically.  <answer131373> You could use the front facing camera to achieve much lower resolution :) There are also some fun apps that simulate the GameBoy camera or similar emvery/em low resolution cameras. But even they save the image scaled up, in order to actually be watchable (despite being pixelized).  For video there are apps that output in low resolution as well, like this https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mrcamera/id546003651  <comment154278> Is there a specific reason for taking a photo in a low resolution, as opposed to simply lowering the resolution after taking it? The opportunities for the latter are almost endless.  Not sure about the former.... <comment154281> No. For the sake of telling some reason, I can tell - ease. I would be happier, if could just take snap with some camera app and open google drive app to upload as opposed to taking a snap in default camera app, opening up another app to resize it and then opening google drive app to upload. <comment154302> Thanks. Exactly what I needed. Free & Light weight. <comment154303> Thanks. But I needed free and lightweight app as mentioned in question. <comment154304> Thanks. But specific mention to rear cam was in the question.
