Make Cmd+C do both Copy and Stop in the terminal <body> Left control Key located in a very unpleasant place on my Mac keyboard. It's hard to reach in the terminal. Luckily, I don't need it very often: I have Cmd for strongmost/strong of the things. There are few cases, where I need it:  Ctrl+R for reverse history search Ctrl+C to kill a process or discard a line  I found Karabiner and it helped with reverse history search remapping. But Ctrl+C puzzles me.  I know that on unix I can use Ctrl+C for both Stop and Copy in the terminal. And it determines what to do from the context: if there is anything selected, copy it. Otherwise, stop command or discard the user input line.  How I can achieve it on OS X with Cmd key?  <answer238492> h3The temporary workaround to this/h3  hr  It is possible to remap keys on any program in strongSystem Preferences/strong  strongKeyboard/strong  strongShortcuts/strong  strongApp Shortcuts/strong. Click the plus icon, and select terminal in the application drop down. Then type the name of the function (strongCopy/strong in this case), and then highlight the shortcut box, and press a desired combination. The window should look something like so:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wMxhK.png" alt="enter image description here"  The above is just an example. This can be applied to virtually any situation and application  <comment292492> On systems like Debian, Copy is remapped to Shift+Ctrl+C. Would you like something like that, or how would you like to distinguish the 2 operations? I might have a solution in mind, which does not quite involve distinguishment through context of the keystroke. <comment292497> @TheBro21 I would prefer to have it without Shift, because that's how it works in OS X everywhere else. Also I use rdp a lot and on windows machines I just remapped Cmd to Ctrl and it works great, so it's already a old habit. <comment292500> I see. I'll try posting my solution as a temporary workaround until a better one is found.
