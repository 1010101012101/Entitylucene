call sharing on apple iphone5 iOS9.1 <body> I getting a record of phone calls to my daughter on my apple iphone5 iOS9.1.  How do I turn off this feature?  <comment257137> Don't use the same Apple ID. <comment257141> Where do you get this record of phone calls, in the phone app, by Mail or somewhere else? <comment257208> I get this on the phone log of "recents" when I press the phone ikon at the bottom of the main menu.  I've had this phone for several years and I never had this problem before I just updated to ios9.1 the other day.
