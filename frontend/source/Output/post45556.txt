iPad messenger for Windows Live Network <body> I'm looking for a FREE chat client that supports Windows Live network (Messenger) and is designed for iPad.  The iPad Windows Live Messenger application is designed for iPhone, so when you install it on iPad, you get a iPhone screen application.  Can someone help me?  <answer45557> Yahoo! Messenger says it supports Windows Live/MSN Messenger accounts, and is a Universal (iPhone &amp; iPad) app.  Not free, but only $0.99 is Live Messenger Pro.  <answer45564> Increase the iPhone app from 1x magnification to 2x. I do it for a bunch of apps that don't have native iPad apps. :)  <answer46569> IMO is free and has been working great for me.   Has great features and supports several protocols.
