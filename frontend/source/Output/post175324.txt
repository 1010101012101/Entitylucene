Is there a built-in way to both save and copy a screenshot to the clipboard at the same time? <body> From what I've seen it seems like the basic hotkeys do not allow such a thing, besides if I use the following command on the terminal :  precodescreencapture -ci somepath/screenshot.jpg /code/pre  It only copies the screenshot to the clipboard but doesn't create the file screenshot.jpg at all (-c copies to clipboard and -i makes the user select a rectangle region to capture)  Thanks for your help.  <answer175346> According to codeman screencapture/code one can only save to the clipboard strongor/strong to a file: there doesn't seem to be any way around this as designed.  The description of the command uses the word 'or' to indicate that only one action is possible: save the screencapture to a file or to the clipboard:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zxSJb.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment206716> Where do you see in "man creencapture" that this is not possible ? <comment206720> Edited answer to show unambiguous language in man description. 'Or' means 'or'.
