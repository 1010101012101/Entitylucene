"No connected camera" error using MacBook Air <body> I have a friend with a 13" MacBook Air. He upgraded to the new software in the App Store about a week ago and now, when he is using anything that uses his built-in camera, it says "There is no connected camera." I've tried looking through his settings and nothing is working to fix the problem. I've found a number of problems, but nothing has worked. We're not sure how to go about solving the problem, even after finding several solutions to no avail.  Anything helps, thanks!  <answer96910> Probably there is some process holding the camera. A dirty hack to solve this issue is to kill the culprit with:  precodesudo killall VDCAssistant /code/pre  <answer121783> I had this problem occasionally too on the same model. A temporary solution was to do a SMC reset and a PRAM reset. You can find the instructions here, or below.  The reason why codesudo killall VDCAssistant/code didn't work for me was that the camera had disappeared completely from the system. It didn't show up in System Report under camera.  A while ago I noticed uneven backlighting on my MBA and had the display changed under warranty. It seems that this fixed the camera problem also, so you may want to take your MBA for a checkup to AppleCare.  h1SMC RESET/h1  ul liShut down the computer./li liPlug in the MagSafe power adapter to a power source, connecting it to the Mac if its not already connected./li liOn the built-in keyboard, press the (left side) Shift-Control-Option keys and the power button at the same time./li liRelease all the keys and the power button at the same time./li liPress the power button to turn on the computer. /li /ul  h1PRAM RESET/h1  ul liShut down the computer./li liLocate the following keys on the keyboard: Command, Option, P, and R.

Most likely, you probably have a third-party app blocking the camera. In my case, it was the Kaspersky Anti-Virus thing. If you go to your anti-virus app  Preferences  Privacy  Stop blocking webcam… it should work. The reason this happen is because blocking the camera protects you from hackers hacking into your camera.  Hope this helps!  <comment105496> Can you help us a bit here by clarifying which upgrade (of which software) are you refering to here and which specific fixes you have already tried (so people know what not to propose any more). A typical recommendation at this point would also be to create a new user on the Mac and see whether the camera works for the new user. <comment105529> I apologize for my ineptitude on this part, but the most recent one as of today. I will try that. <comment105535> No reason to apologize really, it's just that our crystal balls usually work better the more details are already known :-) <comment243889> I have the same problem - the 'new software' was Mavericks, and my camera hasn't worked since. I've killed VDCAssistant, reset the SMC and PRAM, and copied good versions of the AppleCamera DAL and FCP-DAL plugins and kexts from a laptop with a working camera.  Nothing works.
