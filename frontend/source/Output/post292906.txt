Why my logitech blue-tooth keyboard and mouse don't work well with Mac <body> I bought a Logitech wireless keyboard and mouse suite, but they do not work well with my Mac, the mouse usually gets stuck and the there is a large delay when typing with the blue-tooth keyboard. How can I get rid of that?  <answer292941> The Logitec site does not specifically indicate these devices are compatible  with Apple macOS.  These are the only compatible operating systems listed:     Windows® 10 or later, Windows 8, Windows 7, Windows Vista®, Windows XP,   Chrome OS™    <comment369566> Try changing 1) the batteries & 2) the relative positioning of the dongle & peripherals. Move away from all other electronics; speakers; TVs; fridge; microwave etc.
