Apple Store Amazon app has an update but is not available anymore <body> This is quite weird. Amazon had a recent update and when I tried updating it a message popped up saying that it is not longer available. However, the badge icon is always visible and it's stuck there waiting to be updated. Clicking on the app in the update page will prompt a message that asks to change store location because this item is not available in my country. But when I switch, it says I don't have an account/payment option for that country, and changes back to my home country.   I tried the following :  ul lilogging out and in from iTunes /li lideleting the app and reinstalling /li lirestarting phone/li liupdating app to another version released today /li lienabling/disabling automatic downloads/li liclearing cache in App Store/li /ul  None of these mthods solved the problem. I still have a badge icon in the App Store. Any ideas how to fix this?  iOS 10.3.1 - iPhone 7 plus  <answer285549> Updating to the new iOS fixed my problem.  <comment358201> What countries app store are you using? <comment358325> My main is the UAE store, but clicking on the amazon app through the update links switches to the Italian one.
