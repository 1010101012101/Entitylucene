How to keep my iTunes (app) library after reinstalling Windows? <body> I have an iPhone 4 and I'm a windows 7 user; I have the latest iTunes installed on my PC and synchronized with my iPhone; I don't have any music or video in there, as I don't use the iPhone for that purpose, but I have quite a big app library.  If I'm going to reinstall Windows on my computer, or even move to a different one, what should I do to keep my iTunes library? I'm assuming the App Store keeps track of what I've purchased, but how to avoid re-downloading everything again?  <answer17322> precodeHow to avoid re-downloading everything again? /code/pre  Your apps by default are downloaded to the location 'C:\Users\username\Music\iTunes\iTunes Media\Mobile Applications'. Take a copy of the apps from this location and back it up on an external hard drive, flash drive, DVD or a different machine.  When you re-install or move to a new machine, simply bring the apps back to the new PC and drag-drop them on to the apps section of iTunes.  <answer17328> Just backup your whole iTunes Library folder. On the new OS, install iTunes, copy your Library to the old place and open iTunes holding down kbdShift/kbd (Windows) or kbd‚å•/kbd (Mac OS).
