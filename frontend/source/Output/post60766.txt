How to reset Messages application settings in Mountain Lion? <body> I upgraded from Lion to Mountain Lion and, when I started the Messages app for the first time, it imported the iCloud account, a Google Talk account and to old iChat accounts I used in the past. I removed all the unwanted accounts and only left the iCloud one, but the problem is that it is someway duplicated.  Two iCloud accounts appear, one active, with the right account set-up, and the other one in inactive, and I can't delete it. If I configure it with the same data from the first account, or with data of a different account, the second one becomes active and the first one becomes inactive, and I couldn't fin any way of removing one of the two.  Is there a way for resetting the app configuration so that I can restart the program from scratch?  <answer64870> Mac OS X 10.8.2 fixed the problems.  I started the app after the upgrade and the double account was still there. I opened the preferences, the app crashed and, when I restarted it, the problems were gone.  <answer83617> To reset Messages app to default configuration you must delete your user preferences for the application. From the finder toolbar select codeGo &gt; Go To Folder/code and enter code~/Library/Preferences//code. In this folder you need to delete the files that match codecom.apple.iChat.plist/code, or any sub-setting files like codecom.apple.iChat.Jabber.plist/code which will exist for each type of account you have existing your Messages app.  <answer107120> Messages.app uses many files in various locations for storing information.br To completely start from scratch, all these files must be deleted.  ol liDelete the preference files (there are many of these):  precodefind ~/Library/Preferences -name "*iChat*" -delete /code/pre/li liDelete caches:  precoderm -rf ~/Library/Caches/com.apple.Messages /code/pre/li liDelete chat database:  precoderm -rf ~/Library/Messages /code/pre/li /ol  supRemember to take a backup before deleting files./sup  <comment76218> "...he problems were gone?" <comment82438> Yes, I no longer have problems.
