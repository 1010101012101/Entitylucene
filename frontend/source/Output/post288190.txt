Apple Developer forum - Not able to log in into Developer forum <body> I am not able to login into apple developer forum every time it takes me to create a new user account page and the displays the error, I have successfully validated with multiple user name as below screen shot -  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/h2Kw4.png" alt="enter image description here"  when i try to hit submit it gives me below error -   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yO8IR.png" alt="enter image description here"  I have already reported it to apple using bug reporter with id code27240362/code  but there is no response from their side. I am hoping to get some help here.  <answer288191> Assuming you're a registered Developer, I would call the Apple Developer Program Support number for your country, rather than submitting a bug.  You can find your local number here.   <comment363886> Did you clear cookies etc, tried with a different browser, from a different user account on your Mac (create one if necessary)? <comment363887> Also, reaching out to Apple Support might be better than creating a bug with Bugreporter. <comment363888> Yes I did try every other options i.e clearing cookies, trying different browser and trying different location and ISPs as well, nothing seems working. <comment363904> I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because this is a *Customer Support* issue with the Apple Developer site; support questions should be directed there.
