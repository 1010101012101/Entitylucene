iODBC header is not found in Xcode <body> I'm trying to build a project that is using ODBC on Apple, where I installed iODBC. I have Mac OSX 10.8 where I put Xcode 5.1.1 along with an embedded iODBC.  precodeIgors-MacBook-Air:/ igorkorot$ cd /usr/include/ Igors-MacBook-Air:include igorkorot$ find . -name sqlext.h ./sqlext.h Igors-MacBook-Air:~ igorkorot$ ls -la /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/include/sql* ls: /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/include/sql*: No such file or directory /code/pre  The header for iODBC can be found inside /usr/include as can be seen above. I successfully created the project then added the /usr/include to the list of "Header Search Paths", but I'm still getting an error that sqlext.h can not be found.  This is the "Header Search Path" from the project:  precode$(inherited) /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/include  /usr/include /code/pre  Does anybody know what am I missing?  Thank you for any pointers.  P.S.: Since this is an OS X issue I'm posting it here hoping to have more visibility from Mac people.  <comment286775> Did you check the access permissions on `sqlext.h`?
