How to enable a disabled User Account on a MacBook Pro running OS X El Captain? <body> I disabled a User Account in the emSystem Preferences  Users &amp; Groups  Right-click on a User  Advanced Options...  Login shell:/em using: code/bin/false/code  Now the disabled account is visible in the login window but is gone under System Preferences.  I used codesudo chsh &lt;username&gt; /bin/bash/code and codesudo chpass -s /bin/bash &lt;username&gt;/code in emTerminal/em and it didnâ€™t bring it back.  <answer243420> Usually the proper emdisable/em Login Shell value is: em/usr/bin/false/em instead of em/bin/false/em. So I don't know if your em/bin/false/em is just a typo or not.  Even using the false UserShell I haven't been able to reproduce your problem though.  You can try the following: open Terminal and enter  precodedscl . read /Users/user_name /code/pre  to check if the user emuser_name/em is still there.  Then check emUserShell/em:  precodedscl . read /Users/user_name UserShell /code/pre  To modify emUserShell/em use:  precodesudo dscl . change /Users/user_name UserShell /bin/false /bin/bash  /code/pre  Depending on the value found previously you may have to use /usr/bin/false instead of /bin/false as shell which should be replaced.  Then recheck emUserShell/em:  precodedscl . read /Users/user_name UserShell /code/pre  which should yield:     UserShell: /bin/bash   Exit Terminal and open System Preferences. The proper UserShell value should make the lost user visible again in the System Preferences  Users &amp; Groups.  <comment299787> That fixed my problem. Thank you so much :) !!!
