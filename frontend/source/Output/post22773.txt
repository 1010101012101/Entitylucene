Where can I buy a spare power cable for a i5 Mac Mini? <body> I don't see extra power cables for the i5 2011 Mac Mini in the Apple Store Accessory section.  But this power cable looks a lot like black ones I've seen that go between a power brick for a Lenovo laptop and the outlet. Is this the very same cable?  <answer22774> Provided it connects fine you should be ok. It uses a standard power plug with this design. http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4806   Otherwise any sort of Apple Service Provider or http://www.mcmelectronics.com/product/23-190  <comment25382> +1 - the cable is a standard connector. The apple cord material is very high quality, but any old [IEC 60320-1 C7 male connector](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEC_60320) will do. <comment25389> Yeah, it should be a standard cable.
