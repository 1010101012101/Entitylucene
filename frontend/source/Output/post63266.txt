Colorful make compilation output <body> When I used Ubuntu, I remember that the output of codemake/code/codegcc/code/codeg++/code had nice colors, which were particularly helpful when needing to quickly identify errors (they were red).  Is there a way to enable colors for codemake/code et. al. on OS X as well?  <answer63301> codemake/code on OS X does not appear to support color out-of-the-box, and recompiling is painful.  However, I found this codemake/code wrapper which does the job.  <comment73104> Are you using bash or another shell like [zsh](http://superuser.com/questions/290500/zsh-completion-colors-and-os-x)? Either way, you'll want to set up the variables CLICOLOR and LSCOLORS for your shell and see of the tools are compiled for colors or you need to homebrew them... <comment73105> @bmike: I'm using the default shell/Terminal that came with the OS, so bash. Also, I already tried that (https://raw.github.com/gist/3660552/599f439d4dd545ccecb32f22d3b82037ee0d4035/gistfile1.txt), but the output is not colored... Does that mean I can't have color unless I install my own compilation suite (which seems painful)? <comment73133> Probably - you can check the version of the source Apple built for make at http://www.opensource.apple.com - hopefully there is a nice readme that will tell you what compiler flags are needed to recompile things if it doesn't respect an environment variable like other tools.
