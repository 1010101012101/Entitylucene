Creating New Keyboard Shortcots fur Lock Screen and Spotlight search <body> I know the defaults:  ul licontrol+shift+power : Lock screen/li licommand+space : Spotlight/li /ul  I do NOT want to change these -- they must continue to work.  However, due to severely ingrained muscle memory and the fact that I work on many other sensitive systems in the same day, I need to create two new shortcuts that do the same thing:  ul licommand+L (or similar) : Lock screen/li licontrol+space : Spotlight/li /ul  How can this be accomplished on OS X?  (simple settings change, or editing DefaultKeyBinding.dict , or via 3rd party software )  <answer91392> ol liFirst things first:  ul liFirst: The shortcut for Sleep, or Lock Screen is actually kbdShift-Cmd-Eject/kbd (topmost right key on laptops and Bluetooth Apple-supplied keyboards, top right key on full size USB keyboard)./li liSecond: kbdCmd-Space/kbd is the easiest shortcut to use for Spotlight. You cannot just apply a single key to the shortcut like you can in games./li /ul/li liThat being said, I would suggest using kbdCmd-Opt-Ctrl-Shift-Z/kbd (or kbd-X/kbd) for Sleep  ul liGo into System Preferences (System Preferences...) and navigate to the Keyboard Shortcuts pane (System Preferences...KeyboardKeyboard Shortcuts)  ul liAfter testing this, I realized that you actually cannot change the default shortcut for Sleep. However, I do know after testing that there is a shortcut to Shut Down, even though it's not listed on the menu list: kbdCmd-Ctrl-Opt-Function/kbd (bottom right on laptops and Bluetooth Apple-supplied keyboards, in the middle island of six keys on the full size keyboard)/li /ul/li liApple actually does not allow you to have more than one shortcut for each function, otherwise that could possibly cause confusion and/or become a controversy with shortcut on installed applications./li /ul/li /ol  I wish you the best of luck.  -Frazier  <answer91410> You can use KeyRemap4MacBook to map key combinations to other key combinations:  code&lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToConsumer__ KeyCode::L, VK_COMMAND | ModifierFlag::NONE, ConsumerKeyCode::EJECT, ModifierFlag::CONTROL_L | ModifierFlag::SHIFT_L&lt;/autogen&gt;/code  code&lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::SPACE, VK_CONTROL | ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::SPACE, ModifierFlag::COMMAND_L&lt;/autogen&gt;/code  See the source for the key code values and predefined settings.  <comment107330> Control-shift-power / control-shift-eject is the shortcut for display sleep. And you can change the Spotlight shortcut to just a single F-key. <comment107513> Works well for the most part... but not with Synergy :( <comment107543> @LauriRanta On the laptops, Command-control-function-option is for computer sleep, and I didn't know you could change spotlight...
