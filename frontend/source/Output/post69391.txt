How can I add an autocorrect mapping to the iOS dictionary? <body> My iPhone, running iOS 6, used to autocorrect codeill/code - codeI'll/code for me and I liked that. It has, very recently, stopped doing this. I suppose it makes sense given than codeill/code is actually a word, but it is a word I rarely use and certainly use far less frequently than codeI'll/code.  Is there any way to add a correction mapping back to the iOS 6 dictionary such that typing codeill/code autocorrects to codeI'll/code for me?  <answer69392> My workaround has been to add a keyboard shortcut that replaces the text codeill/code with codeI'll/code any time I add it. Not perfect, but as a stop-gap it will do.  To add the shortcut go to Settings - General - Keyboard and scroll to the bottom of the page. You will see an codeAdd New Shortcut.../code button. Press it.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fDLAZ.png" alt="enter image description here"  In the Shortcut configuration page type codeI'll/code in to the Phrase entry box and codeill/code in to the Shortcut entry box and press the codeSave/code button.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1zLn6.png" alt="enter image description here"  Now any time you type codeill/code it will auto-correct to codeI'll/code.  <answer69395> It's an imperfect solution, but there's always the option of resetting the Keyboard Dictionary. This undoes all the learning your iPhone has done, so you're back to the fresh-out-of-the-box behaviour. Obviously this may be a set-back in some areas, but if you're getting strange behaviour, it may be the way to go.  To reset the learning, open strongSettings → General → Reset/strong and tap strongReset Keyboard Dictionary/strong.  <comment80627> Somehow my iPhone started autocorrecting "thr" to "Thr". This shortcut workaround solved that problem for me. <comment80629> I noticed this too a few weeks ago, on an iPhone which is still running iOS 5. <comment80687> This is overkill.
