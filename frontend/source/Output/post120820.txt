How do I disable the Google Translation bar when using iPhone? <body> Some websites offer the Google Translation Bar hard-coded into their pages so when I visit those this bar appears on top. Like in this example:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dxFvO.png" alt="Google Translation Bar Example"  The problem with this bar however is, is that it's not scrollable. So when viewing the page on an iPhone, I can't get to the Options button of it at the far right. So I can't select Options to disable Google Translate for this website.  In Chrome you can go to Settings to turn Google Translate off for all websites. But in Safari for iPhone you can't do that. And I can't swipe the bar or something like that to get to all options. So how am I supposed to disable that translation bar when I can't get to it?  <answer233485> Using IOS, open google homepage. Tap on 3 buttons tab in upper right. Tap Settings, then tap Content Settings. Slide bar left to turn off function.
