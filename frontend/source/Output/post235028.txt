Deactivate shortcut launching airplay <body> Everytime I use cmd + shift + p (which is used in a lot of advanced text editor like sublime to open the command palette) my mac opens a window img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lfS3y.png" alt="asking me to enter the airplay code".   I don't want this mac to be connected to airplay.  I've looked at all airplay settings in system preferences as well as the keyborad shortcuts one. I even set a global cmd + shift + p on an arbitrary command to make it conflict with the airplay one, without success.  Installing keycues and cheatsheet didn't help me find it.  <answer245856> Noizio was actually at fault here. The application maps codeCommand + Shift + P/code as its "Play/Pause" hotkey, overriding Sublime's own hotkey for the Command Palette. I modified the hotkey for Noizio to a different key pattern, and the issue was resolved.  <comment303145> We like answers to be more than just a single line.
