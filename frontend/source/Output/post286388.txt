'unknown file attribute: i' error on DefaultKeyBinding.dict file <body> I would like to swap some key bindings on macOS Sierra. I have used Karabiner so far but unfortunately it is no longer working on Sierra.  So I tried to use codeDefaultKeyBinding.dict/code, but after I set it, I found that all the keys except ones that I modified were no longer working (the typing isn't reflected). I tried codesource DefaultKeyBinding.dict/code and got the following error:  precode/Users/me/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict:2: unknown file attribute: i /Users/me/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict:3: unknown file attribute: i /code/pre  Here is my codeDefaultKeyBinding.dict/code file:  precode{ ";" = ("insertText:", ":"); ":" = ("insertText:", ";"); "'" = ("insertText:", '"'); '"' = ("insertText:", "'"); "\\" = ("insertText:", "\U007f"); "\U007f" = ("insertText:", "\\"); } /code/pre  What is the meaning of the error and what is wrong with this dict file?  <answer286517> Or use Karabiner-Elements, the supported successor to Karabiner.
