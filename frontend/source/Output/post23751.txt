How to turn Mac OS X Lion into a web server? <body> After using MAMP for ages, I found out I could actually use Snow Leopard's built-in Apache server. Now that I've upgraded to Lion, I have no idea how to do this anymore.  Do you know how to turn my Mac OS X Lion into a web server, so that I can easily run the latest version of PHP and MySQL in it? Also, how do I set the "localhost" aliases? I remember it was a httpd.conf file — something that I don't seem to find anymore on Lion.  <answer23757> You first need to enable Apache in the Sharing prefpane. Check "Web sharing" and your web server is running.   strongNote that since Mountain Lion/strong, Web Sharing was removed from the Sharing preference pane, but Apache is still included. Check this answer for controlling Apache in Mountain Lion.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vDOAS.png" alt="Enable Web Sharing"  To activate PHP you'll need to edit code/etc/apache2/httpd.conf/code in Terminal.app. This requires root credentials. codenano/code is a very accessible command-line editor if you are uncomfortable with codevim/code.  precodesudo nano /etc/apache2/httpd.conf /code/pre  Find the line (you can press kbdctrl/kbd + kbdW/kbd to start searching in codenano/code):  precode#LoadModule php5_module libexec/apache2/libphp5.so /code/pre  and uncomment it. Next find the line  precode#Include /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf /code/pre  and uncomment that as well to enable virtual hosts support.  Save the file and exit codenano/code by pressing kbdctrl/kbd + kbdX/kbd, then confirming the changes by pressing kbdY/kbd(es), then kbdenter/kbd.  You can now edit your virtual hosts in the file code/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf/code  precodesudo nano /etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf /code/pre  Important to note is that the first defined host will be the default host for unqualified host names. For resolving additional hostnames apart from codelocalhost/code I recommend hardcoding them in code/etc/hosts/code.  To install MySQL, download the installer from the MySQL website (64bit installer should be ok). Follow the instructions to install it.  Finally, to configure PHP for MySQL, copy the default codephp.ini/code:  precodesudo cp /etc/php.ini.default /etc/php.ini /code/pre  Now you can edit code/etc/php.ini/code (again root access required) and replace any reference to code/var/mysql/mysql.sock/code with code/tmp/mysql.sock/code (the default location of the MySQL socket after running the installer). There probably are about 3 references to that path.  Finally, restart Apache for the new configuration to take effect:  precodesudo apachectl restart /code/pre  Alternatively you can restart Apache by toggling it off and on again in the Sharing prefpane.  Done.  <answer52227> You can find a good tutorial here to enable also phpmyadmin and such without using mamp  <answer52235> Just for the record, an alternative to MAMP is WebStart  that makes it easy to manage a professional Apache 2 web sever on Mac OS X 10.7 Lion.  <comment49140> i would advise you to never suggest any sort of terminal text editor, just use textedit.app in the command instead of nano, because terminal text editors are just barbaric. <comment49149> Nano is quite user-friendly, IMO, and it's really annoying to try to edit something with root privileges from the GUI. <comment49226> @XAleXOwnZX: I'm sorry but that's just bad advice. If anything, you'll find it next to impossible to edit these files in TextEdit.app because a lack of privileges, as NReilingh also pointed out. Also, it is not unreasonable to expect some aquaintance with the console from any (aspiring) web developer. <comment49312> generally works if u sudo it <comment49318> Did you try that out @XAleXOwnZX? <comment49324> yeah but it might be cuz i gave my account root permissions xD, i'll try it later <comment58541> @XAleXOwnZX: With all due respect, that is arguably the worst advice I have ever seen on a Stack Exchange property. I agree that a GUI text editor is probably a better approach for people who are not programmers or who don't have much unix experience, however, TextEdit is the wrong application to advise using simply because it defaults to a variable-width font and rich text. This can cause all sorts of problems (beyond the simple usability nightmare of writing code in variable-width) that will be extremely difficult or impossible for this person to debug. <comment58566> well obv you'd switch to plain text mode… (if it wasn't already since textedit switches to plain text when opening regular .txts) <comment59746> I believe this is much easier in Lion Server.  These days the price of that is reasonable even for hobby projects. <comment59749> @ThorbjørnRavnAndersen depends on the purpose. For a web dev box I find OS X Server overkill, and you'd still have to deal with config files to accomplish everything anyway. <comment83510> Just a little help for GUI editor lovers: For using TextMate as default editor from Terminal you can call it as `mate`. sudo mate /etc/apache2/httpd.conf It is a good idea to register it in ~/.bash_profile for that purpose before the 1st use: export EDITOR='mate -w' And create a symlink in your ~/bin folder: ln -s /Applications/TextMate.app/Contents/Resources/mate ~/bin/mate **The above info applies to Mac OS X users* <comment247124> Answers on Ask Different need to be more than just a link. It's okay to include a link, but please summarize or excerpt it in the answer. The idea is to make the answer stand alone. <comment262834> In which universe is a terminal editor "barbaric", imho TextEdit.app is barbaric. I'd (tongue in cheek) expect some smarty pants vi(m) or sed replies, I'd only expect TextEdit from a Windows user.
