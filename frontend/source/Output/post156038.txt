I want software to slow down my typing and increase my accuracy <body> strongProblem/strong  I'd like to teach myself to type slower and more accurately.  strongSolutions?/strong  I was thinking of  ul liplaying a sound when I press backspace/li lidisplaying wpm/accuracy in the menubar/li /ul  strongAside/strong  The reason I want to do this is I went to a conference the other day where I saw a live coding session where the guy didn't make a strongSINGLE TYPO/strong for the 30 minutes I watched,  - and apparently, he had not made a mistake for the 30 minutes before.  <answer156172> You can use Karabiner to play a sound when you press delete. For example save this file as code~/Library/Application Support/Karabiner/private.xml/code:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;   &lt;vkopenurldef&gt;     &lt;name&gt;KeyCode::VK_OPEN_URL_SHELL_BEEP&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;url type="shell"&gt;afplay /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/ScreenReader.framework/Versions/A/Resources/Sounds/BrailleChordFailed.aiff&lt;/url&gt;   &lt;/vkopenurldef&gt;   &lt;item&gt;     &lt;name&gt;custom&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;identifier&gt;custom&lt;/identifier&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::DELETE, ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::DELETE, KeyCode::VK_OPEN_URL_SHELL_BEEP&lt;/autogen&gt;   &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  Then open the Karabiner application, press the ReloadXML button and enable the setting.  You could also use Master Key or TypeRacer to practice typing pieces of plain text.  <comment183614> When I get time I'm going to try and write an apple script that plays a sound on keypress.

I chose the more annoying "Ellipsis.aiff"
