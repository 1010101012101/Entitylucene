iPhone 4s: How do I see versions of my apps? <body> The App Store is telling me I have an update to an app that is currently installed, and it shows the new version. How do I see the version I currently have?  The closest thing I was able to find is a Cydia app called AppInfo, but I can't jailbreak yet (nor am I comfortable doing so).  Is there another way? The ideal answer could be done on the device itself, but barring that, I'm ok with transferring something to my Mac and viewing it there (e.g. with iExplorer).  <answer69372> On your iPhone:    ul liOpen the codeSettings/code app  /li liGo to codeGeneral/code-codeUsage/code  /li liUnder the codeStorage/code section, wait till it shows the list of apps  /li liClick on the app you're interested in to see the App Version, the App Size and the amount of data it has stored on the device./li /ul  This works only for third party apps. The Apple provided stock apps will not show this information.  <comment80616> Thanks - that worked. I thought I tried that, but I might've clicked on a built-in app instead one from the Store. Built-in ones don't show the version. <comment80702> Yes, stock apps do not show the version. I have updated the answer with this information.
