Use unsupported USB footswitch? <body> I am attempting to use this footswitch:  http://www.scythe-usa.com/product/input/008/usbfootswitch_detail.html  They only support windows, and USB Overdrive apparently doesn't support it either.  I want to use it to click the mouse in OSX.  Is there a software that will allow this configuration?  <answer264087> Runs the setup software under Windows. The pedal stores the settings itself.  <comment93763> It doesn't need any drivers under Windows, so I wonder why it doesn't work out of the box. <comment94942> Oh, it "works" it comes out of the box asigned to the keyboard keys '1', '2', and '3'. However, I want to assign it to the mouse buttons, and this has thus-far proven impossible, (they also don't accept returns for this item :\   ) <comment165876> Did you ever resolve this? I have an issue with usb footswitch I am trying to get working under mavericks http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/140732/sending-controlleft-command-with-external-footswitch-delcom-only-picking-up-c <comment169097> No it was never resolved, someone needs to write a driver for it. :(
