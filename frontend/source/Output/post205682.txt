How can I make vim "command mode" the default mode for terminal <body> I use vim commands in my terminal..  But by default, the mode when I open up terminal is the "insert mode".  Is it possible to enter in "command mode" when I open a terminal session?   <answer205684> strongReadline Init File, code~/.inputrc/code/strong  Depending on the command(s) you run to get your console in the desired mode, just add that line in code~/.inputrc/code. This should be sufficient.  If code~/.inputrc/code does not exist, you can create it without worries.  A line with codeset keymap vi-command/code sets your Terminal to' command mode'; a line with codeset keymap vi-insert/code your Terminal to 'insert mode'.   <answer294834> No there in no way to start your terminal in command mode.  The codeset keymap/code setting is used to customize the keymap within terminal. A line with codeset keymap vi-command/code means that mappings below that line apply to command mode; a line with codeset keymap vi-insert/code means that mappings below that line apply to insert mode. For more details see: http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Use_vi_shortcuts_in_terminal  But starting from bash version 4.3 you can change your prompt to highlight which mode you are currently in by putting codeset show-mode-in-prompt on/code in your code~/.inputrc/code file. This with put either code(ins)/code or code(cmd)/code at the start of your prompt. You can further customize it by using command:  codeset vi-cmd-mode-string "\1\e[1;31m\2(cmd)\1\e[0m\2"/code -- will give light red color  codeset vi-ins-mode-string "\1\e[1;35m\2(ins)\1\e[0m\2"/code -- will give light purple color  You can pick any of the following color by their ANSI codes: code Black            \e[0;30m Blue             \e[0;34m Green            \e[0;32m Cyan             \e[0;36m Red              \e[0;31m Purple           \e[0;35m Brown            \e[0;33m Gray             \e[0;37m Dark Gray        \e[1;30m Light Blue       \e[1;34m Light Green      \e[1;32m Light Cyan       \e[1;36m Light Red        \e[1;31m Light Purple     \e[1;35m Yellow           \e[1;33m White            \e[1;37m /code  <comment248049> I don't want to "run" any command.  Right now I have 'set editing-mode vi' in my ~/.inputrc. So in my terminal if I press 'Esc', it goes from command mode to the input mode..   What I want is, when i open terminal, it should go to command mode automatically, and I should be able to switch to vim mode when I press 'i'. How can that be achieved? <comment248072> `set keymap vi-command` <comment248623> That doesn't work.
