How can I power my MacBook Pro during trans-Atlantic flights? <body> What is Apple's solution for powering MacBooks on intercontinental flights?  My 85 watt power supply trips most airline seat power supplies, which are rated at only 75 watts.  What's a poor trans-Atlantic worker to do to keep his MacBook Pro charged in-flight?  <answer116056> You could get one of those external battery packs. Hyper makes them specifically for MBPs.
