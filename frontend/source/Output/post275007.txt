I had this working before in the past before the reinstallation.  Also, I have it working on another older MacBook Pro. (Post 2013)  I get the following dialog:     strongYour Apple Watch must be signed into iCloud to allow it to unlock your Mac./strong   You can sign in using the Apple Watch app on your iPhone.   After trying the following steps, I still get the dialog.  ul liVerified that the Apple Watch is indeed signed in on the proper Apple ID/li liVerified that macOS is signed in on the same Apple ID/li liRebooted the Apple Watch and unlocked it (See this answer)/li liVerified that all components are on the same WiFi network and Bluetooth is enabled/li /ul  I have not unpaired the watch then paired again.
