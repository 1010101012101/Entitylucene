ISO 9660 on Lion. "No Mountable Filesystems" <body> I have a collection iso images that all mount on an imac running snow leopard but not on my 2011 MBP with Lion.  They are formatted iso 9660, but I don't know at what level.  When I mount them with disk utility on lion, I get "No mountable filesystems"  When I mount them with Toast Titanium, I get Result Code 192.  On the snow leopard Machine, I'm able to mount them and convert them to DMGs, but these DMGs still do not work on my Lion machine.  I am able to burn these images w/ the Lion machine, but the DVD's will not load on finder.  I am able to create a new image on the snow leopard machine, and put the contents of the old image in, and have that new image work on the lion machine.  My best guess is that there are some system level drivers not provided with lion.    Thanks for any help  <comment47342> Does this happen with all of the ISOs you have? I've not had any issues mounting ISO images (some containing embedded DMG files) with Lion - FWIW, the same images mount fine using Snow Leopard. <comment47358> I think it depends on how they are created.  These ones-- possibly of windows origin-- cause trouble.
