Change 'New folder' default name <body> When we create 'new folder' in finder it will automatically named 'untitled folder'.  Is it possible to change that default folder name to current date name, for example "20151223"?  <answer220669> With the assistance of AppleScript you can accomplish this.  Open AppleScript Editor, create a new document and paste the following stolen lines:  precodetell application "Finder"     try         if exists Finder window 1 then             set thisPath to (the target of the front window) as alias         else             set thisPath to (path to desktop)         end if     on error         return     end try end tell set x to my the_perfect_datestring() if x is not "-ERROR" then     set fullPath to thisPath &amp; x as text     tell application "Finder"         try             --activate             if not (exists fullPath) then                 set y to make new folder at thisPath with properties {name:x}             end if             activate             open y         end try     end tell end if on the_perfect_datestring()     try         set cd to (the current date)         set the_year to year of (cd) as number         set the_month to month of (cd) as number         set the_day to day of (cd) as number         if the_month &lt; 10 then set the_month to "0" &amp; the_month         if the_day &lt; 10 then set the_day to "0" &amp; the_day         return ((the_year &amp; the_month &amp; the_day) as string)     on error         return "-ERROR"     end try end the_perfect_datestring /code/pre  Save the file as AppleScript application (e.g. DateFolder.app) somewhere (e.g ~/Applications).  Open a folder and drop the DateFolder.app on the toolbar:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hAnE8.jpg" alt="Finder toolbar"  To create a folder in an open folder just hit the app's icon in the toolbar. The new folder will open automatically. Remove line 22 in the script (codeopen y/code) if you don't want the new folder to be opened. If you add the app to the Dock and open it, it will create a new folder in the frontmost folder or on the desktop (if no folder is open).  emOnly tested in Mac OS X 10.7.5.
