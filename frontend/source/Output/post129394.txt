Generate PDF with table of contents from Microsoft Word on Mac OS X <body> I need to generate PDF documents with a emPDF table of contents/em from Microsoft Word 2011.   The emPDF table of contents/em can for example be viewed in Preview using codeView -&gt; Table of Contents/code.   This works well on my Windows machine. I just:  ol liSelect codeSave As &gt; PDF/code/li liClick codeOptions/code/li liCheck the codeCreate Bookmarks using headings/code check box./li /ol  But on Mac OS X this option is not available.  This has been asked multiple times before, for example here on SuperUser, but the only solution is to use the Windows version of Word, or using online tools like doc2pdf.  <answer129460> Word:Mac uses OS X's built-in PDF creator.  Word for Windows either uses Adobe's PDF creator or its own (depending on which version of Word for Windows you're using), which is why the functionality is different between the two applications.  OS X's built-in PDF creator doesn't do what you want.  If you have a license for Adobe Acrobat (not Acrobat Reader, but the full Acrobat), you can use Adobe's PDF creator.    Another option which others have reported having success with (and which doesn't require an expensive Acrobat license) is this:  ol liSave your Word document to your computer./li liUpload your Word document to Google Drive. Do NOT convert it to another format when you upload./li liGet the OpenAsPDF app. Its a Google Drive App. /li liOpen your Word document with OpenAsPDF app./li liUse the Save As dialogue to save back to your computer./li liBefore saving, change the extension to .pdf./li /ol  <comment178391> I can't find the App OpenAsPDF. Can you please post a link to it? <comment184297> Adobe Acrobat, using an online tool, or using the Windows version of Word are apparently the only options. I ended up using the Windows version. <comment188775> I'd say it's the http://www.openaspdf.com/ *"Chrome"* app that is mentioned there. Looks like a service to get a document from your HD or Google Drive and convert it. Probably a good option -- unless the document might be a bit sensitive - in that case I'd like to know a bit more about the overall proces...
