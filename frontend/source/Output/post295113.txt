Could not read LR from frame at 0x0000700005dc3ca8 <body> My MacBook locks up and shuts down. I have read numerous threads but haven't been able to get the info to fix this.  I do get this error;   precodeRoot disk errors: "Could not recover SATA HDD after 5 attempts. Terminating." /code/pre  I have an aftermarket HD. I installed this a few years ago. so other than the HD going bad not sure what else it could be.  I had El Capitan installed when this originated. I just recently installed Sierra.  precodeAnonymous UUID:       DB85C25A-DACB-9477-FE00-F424E6DDED2F  Fri Aug  4 14:19:36 2017  *** Panic Report *** panic(cpu 2 caller 0xffffff801336b46f): initproc exited  -- exit reason namespace 2 subcode 0xa description: none  uuid info:  0x110bb6000    uuid = &lt;322c06b7-8878-311d-888c-c8fd2ca96ff3&gt;  0x10791a000    uuid = &lt;0ac314b8-c89c-3912-8bb7-e3f92c847169&gt;  Thread 5 crashed  RAX: 0x000000010791a000, RBX: 0x00007fffcc0eb108, RCX: 0x00007fffcc0eb108, RDX: 0x0000000110bf5978 RSP: 0x00007000060527e0, RBP: 0x00007000060527e0, RSI: 0x00000000000016f7, RDI: 0x0000000110bf8b18 R8:  0x00007fffcc0eb139, R9:  0x0000000000000000, R10: 0x0000000004001080, R11: 0x000000010795e188 R12: 0x0000000110bf8b18, R13: 0x00007ff8b202fa00, R14: 0x00000000000016f7, R15: 0x0000000110bf5978 RFL: 0x0000000000010206, RIP: 0x0000000110bc9fd4, CS:  0x000000000000002b, SS:  0x0000000000000023  Thread 0: 0xffffff801f0c34e8     0x00007fffcc216386       Could not read LR from frame at 0x0000700005dc3ca8  Thread 1: 0xffffff801f5e5050     0x00007fffcc21e1e6     0x00007fffcc0c724f     0x0000000000000000  Thread 2: 0xffffff8020c0ddf0     0x00007fffcc21f6ae     0x00007fffcc0cea16     0x00007fffcc0c4a6c     0x00007fffcc0bc13b     0x00007fffcc0cf7db     0x00007fffcc0c2306     0x00007fffcc0bb6b5     0x00007fffcc0bb48c     0x00007fffcc3085a2     0x00007fffcc30807d     0x0000000000000000  Thread 3: 0xffffff8023349b90     0x00007fffcc308070  Thread 4: 0xffffff8023c19510     0x0000000110bc9fd4     0x0000000110bd2f8b     0x0000000110bba86d     0x00007fffcc0eb282     0x000000010795e188     0x00000001079459cd     0x00007fffcc0b98fc     0x00007fffcc0cea16     0x00007fffcc0c4a6c     0x00007fffcc0bc13b     0x00007fffcc0cf7db     0x00007fffcc0c2306     0x00007fffcc0bb6b5     0x00007fffcc0bb48c     0x00007fffcc3085a2     0x00007fffcc30807d     0x0000000000000000  Thread 5: 0xffffff8023c14b90     0x0000000110bc9fd4     0x0000000110bd2f8b     0x0000000110bba86d     0x00007fffcc0eb282     0x000000010795e188     0x0000000107929510     0x00007fffcc0b98fc     0x00007fffcc0cea16     0x00007fffcc0c4a6c     0x00007fffcc0bc13b     0x00007fffcc0cf7db     0x00007fffcc0c2306     0x00007fffcc0bb6b5     0x00007fffcc0bb48c     0x00007fffcc3085a2     0x00007fffcc30807d     0x0000000000000000   Mac OS version: 16G29  Kernel version: Darwin Kernel Version 16.7.0: Thu Jun 15 17:36:27 PDT 2017; root:xnu-3789.70.16~2/RELEASE_X86_64 Kernel UUID: D3314D98-5D40-3CD8-98A4-F1DD46C20E03 System model name: MacBookPro6,2 (Mac-F22586C8) Root disk errors: "Could not recover SATA HDD after 5 attempts.

The first rule of diagnostics is to not overlook the obvious.  So, the very first thing that you should do is strongdiagnose the hard drive/strong.  ul liRun Apple Hardware Test (AHT).  Hold the D key while booting from a powered off state with the AC adapter connected and run the tests associated with the disk drive/li liBoot into recovery mode or with a USB installer (preferred) and via terminal issue the command codediskutil info diskX | grep -i smart/code where diskX is the identifier of the drive in question.  To get this issue the command codediskutil list/code/li /ul  Once you have determined the viability of your drive, then you can move on to what the other ailments could possibly be.  Chances are, you will need to replace your hard drive because it's failing..  You mentioned that you already changed the HDD to an aftermarket one "a few years ago."  Depending on the brand and quality of the drive you may already be outside it's useful life.  <comment372512> Unable to get to the diagnostics. When I try It just comes up with a triangle with a Asterisk in it and just does nothing. The SSD actually has a 10 year warranty on it. One thing I did find is that the intake for the cooling fans had a large amount of debris. I vacuumed that out. Haven't seen the error yet would normally happen within 1/2hr of use. The funny thing is I ran into this a few years ago on my brother in-laws computer and that caused a lot of issues due to over heating. I don't have a recovery USB I will be taking care of that tonight! Thanks for the input <comment372513> Is it a HDD or SDD?  It's an important and significant difference.  If you can run it for a half hour or so, you should be able to execute the commands I posted directly from the booted OS. <comment372515> its a San Disk Extreme Pro SSD. So when I try to hold down the D. It just comes up with the triangle with the asterisk in the middle below that it has apple.com/support -3403D. I read on another forum that on the older mac it may require a utility disk to get to the diagnostics <comment372516> I believe that's correct - you will need the "Installation Disk 2" which contains the AHT software.  Instead, try [DiskDrill](https://www.cleverfiles.com/) - the diagnostic tools are free.  But to fully test it out, you will need your install disks. <comment372517> looks like I will have to take it to apple store. I cant find the original disks. Thanks for the help.
