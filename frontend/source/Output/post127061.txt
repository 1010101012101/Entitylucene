iMac Multi-user and notifications <body> I always used my iMac alone and now I'm about to share it with someone but the multi-user thing is quite new to me.  I know we can't have more than one Apple ID (iCloud, itunes etc..) by session so we need to configure two different sessions but what about the notifications (FaceTime/Skype calls, emails arriving)?  As I work a lot on the iMac, it will be most of the time active on my own session but is there any way the other person can still get the notifications when someone calls him via FaceTime or Skype or even when an email arrives to his mailbox while my own session is open?  A notification is enough. Then he could come and switch the session in order to answer his call or read his email.  Moreover, any way he can be seen on Skype as available while my session is open? It would make sense because, whatever the opened session, he's still around and ready to pick up.  Possible natively or via any app/workaround?  PS: When I say "Notifications", I'm not exclusively talking about the Mac OSX's brand new "Notification" feature but just a way to be notified in real time somehow, whatever the means.  Thank you for your help.
