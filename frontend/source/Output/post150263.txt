Bluetooth Dongle Connection "Failed to open an RFCOMM serial channel" on MacBook Pro <body> I tried to setup another computer with a Bluetooth dongle to connect my Macbook Pro (OS X Mavericks). I managed to pair them and ever since then I get these messages every 10-30 seconds and often they crash and freeze the BT:     strongA bluetooth serial failure has occurred./strongbr   Failed to open an RFCOMM serial channel.br   Check if authentication needs to be enabled in your device.   I removed the offending Bluetooth dongle from the favourites and deleted the com.apple.bluetooth.plist file, yet the dongle keeps trying to connect and the error messages keep popping up.  How can I block that dongle from connecting?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nOaML.png" alt="Error dialog"  <comment177085> Any luck? I have a similar problem. I'm trying to read the serial port for the paired device. Starting a screen session on the port results into this error for me.
