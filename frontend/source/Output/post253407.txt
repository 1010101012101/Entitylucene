Unable to turn of screen while making WhatsApp call on loudspeaker io10 update <body> After updating iPhone 6 to iOS 10, WhatsApp call ends when you press the power button to turn off screen while you are talking on the loudspeaker. Does anyone know how to fix this?  <comment315339> Have you checked with WhatsApp support to find out if this is normal for the app now? <comment315343> haven't found anything related to this in their latest update. It was working before ios10 update. You could make a call via loudspeaker and press the power button to turn of the screen while the call still continues. It save me battery and my eye from the bright screen alway on. <comment315344> Do you have `Background App Refresh` turned on for WhatsApp? <comment315346> Yes. It is turned on.
