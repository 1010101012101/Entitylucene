Stop App Store prompting for specific system update <body> I have a Brother MFC printer, and installed the latest drivers from the Brother website. All is good, everything works.  The App Store now prompts me that there is an update available: Brother Printer Software Update 2.10. This looks like an Apple package, and isn't the same as the Brother one.  With this installed I can't print, and it doesn't even think the printer has a scanner attached. After deleting the printer, re-installing the Brother package, and re-adding the printer it's all working again.  It appears in the top Software Update section of the Updates page, not in the section below for regular app updates.  Is there a way to specifically block this one update? I know app updates have been discussed in other questions, this isn't it.  I'm on 10.8.2  <answer80864> Turns out that if you click on "More Info" and expand the update fully, you can then right-click on it and choose "Ignore Update".  <answer114819> For Mac OS X 10.8.3:  Right clicking option for me says "Hide update". That would solve the OP's problem of blocking the one update.   However, it would be nice to have some Preferences to customize.   <comment98447> What ALEX said is correct. (and it's supposed to work that way). BUT... Turns out that the right-click option only works in certain cases. No documentation or explanation as to why. Just hundreds of threads on various forums complaining that this doesn't consistently work.
