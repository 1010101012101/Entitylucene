Does right clicking always select the text below the cursor on a mac? <body> I am pretty new to mac, I am on a desktop mac with a Logitech mouse.  Every time I right click on some text - it selects the word under the cursor.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Qvh3c.png" alt="right click on mouse"  Is this normal? If it is - is there any way to avoid this. For example - I need to copy the link address in a browser, but when I right click - it selects the text and gives me a different context menu which doesn't have the copy link URL option.  <answer150569> So I am using the Firefox.  When I right click on link in a browser it shows this menu  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PdA8h.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  When I click on text (not link) in browser or any other document it shows the same menu as yours.  When I click on the web address in the address bar it shows the menu with Copy, that I use to cop the link.  <comment177177> It is "normal"! <comment177181> Yep, turns out the link must have a URL, the ones that I was trying to click did not have any URL, they were just styled to look like links.
