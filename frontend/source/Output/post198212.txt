How to copy found text (highlighted) in TextEdit <body> I'm looking for copying the patterns that I find. For example for this, I would like to copy all the "bcbc":  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EbP9K.png" alt="enter image description here"  and being able to paste it somewhere like "bcbcbcbcbcbcbcbcbcbc" (bcbc x5).  Do you know any way to do it?  Thanks in advance. Regards. Rafael.  hr  This is the pattern exactly:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iXAmx.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment237128> What is it you need this for, where does it need to be pasted? <comment237130> I need to extract some patterns from html, but the patterns should change and I can find them very quick with TextEdit <comment237133> Can you give a sample pattern? I don't believe text edit has support for this, but I'm sure there is another application that can do this. (I just don't know of it) <comment237134> @zggz12 I updated the question ;) <comment237142> Have you tried `regex`?
