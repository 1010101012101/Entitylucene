Why were my permissions different from the default and what are the implications of "fixing" them? <body> For some time now my Finder "Get Info" dialogs have been displaying "Fetching...", and I recently decided to fix the problem by following the instructions for resetting my home folder permissions. As expected, this resolved the issue, but now the permissions on all of my files are   precode-rw-r-----   1 MyName  staff   ... FileNow /code/pre  whereas before they were  precode-rw-r-----   1 MyName  MyName  ... FileBefore /code/pre  and I wonder: Why were they different before? Is there some common operation that causes permissions to change from the default, to what I had? Was the default perhaps different in earlier versions of OS X? Are there security implications of this change?  <comment93591> Note that `staff` isn't even a group I'm in (I'm in `admin`). I'm not sure what the implications of that are, or who ends up in that group. <comment93592> that is because you have admin rights. a normal user is in staff <comment93594> ALso note that the Apple note to rename users only includes OSs up to Lion - so not ML - take note of what details are on a article - I don't know what if anything ML has changed or if the note just has not een updated.. <comment93595> @Mark: Good point. I followed [these](http://osxdaily.com/2011/11/15/repair-user-permissions-in-mac-os-x-lion/) (same) instructions, which mentioned ML explicitly.
