Why does my home directory location keep reverting to the previous setting? <body> I have two hard drives in my MacBook Pro: one is a solid state drive that holds the OS and Applications, the other a spinning platter drive that holds my home directory.  I currently have code/Users/ian/code as a symlink to  code/Volumes/Macintosh HD/Users/ian/code.  And in my user profile my home directory is code/Users/ian/code:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EN9fE.png" alt="Current home directory settings"  When I change the Home directory field to code/Volumes/Macintosh HD/Users/ian/code and perform the requested restart of my machine, after I log back in, my home directory is set back to code/Users/ian/code.  Why won't my changes to this setting stick?  <answer58135> I suspect the problem was me trying to change my home directory emfrom/em my account. I was able to make it work by:  ol liCreating a new user on the system/li liGiving that new user Administrator privileges/li liLogging out of my account/li liLogging in to the new user account/li liEditing my account's home directory from the new account/li /ol  After that was done the changes stuck and my home directory is now on my HD instead of SSD. I kept the other account around for now, though I stripped it of Adminstrator privileges.
