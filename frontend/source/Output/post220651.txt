How should I properly format my iPod nano 5th generation? <body> I've been the happy owner of an iPod nano 5th gen, 8Gb for a few years. Over the years, I've added and deleted many songs, lyrics, album art, etcetera, and I recently assumed that something was corrupted in the drive: when I would add new album artwork to a song, it would either not work or add the album art of one song to a lot of other totally unrelated songs.  This thread is excellent to start troubleshooting, but didn't really help on a iPod nano (emdiagnostics mode/em is limited on this model).  emPermissions Repair/em (or actually "emFirst Aid/em" as it is now called) didn't find anything.  So I backed up all the songs I had on the it to my MBP. I also checked that the files were not corrupted.  I would like to restore the device the best possible way, before I put the tracks back on it.  When I launched the (brand-new) El Capitan's emDisk Utility/em, there was a new setting I hadn't seen in previous versions, called "scheme".  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/isYsc.png" alt="enter image description here"  The options are:  ol liGUID Partition Map/li liMaster Boot Record/li liApple Partition Map/li /ol  I'm not really sure which one to use for an iPod nano, and couldn't find anything online.  <answer243911> The best way to handle an iPod Restore is to do it from iTunes.    iTunes knows what it is &amp; how to format it - it will even actually format differently depending on whether you have iTunes on a PC or Mac, to enable easier file handling afterwards.  ul liIf it's a model with a lock switch at the top [red dot visible] switch the lock off first [white dot] - Some models will crash if you don't./li liPlug it into the computer, launch iTunes if it doesn't launch automatically./li liClick the device icon in the top bar, choose the iPod if you see multiple devices listed./li liClick Restore. Follow the onscreen instructions.br You will need to resync afterwards./li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wNCl5.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment267091> From all this I understand that you would like to reset your device.Am I right ? <comment267094> Restore it in iTunes, not Disk Utility. If I could find my old iPod, I'd add an answer with pics... <comment300269> @Tetsujin could you expand your comment into an answer? Thanks!
