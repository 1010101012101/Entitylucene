Mavericks update broke ssh key-based authentication <body> I regularly ssh to one of my OS X boxes. I have configured ssh key-based authentication i.e. added my client-end code~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub/code to server-end code~/.ssh/authorized_keys2/code with restricted enough permissions. This setup has worked fine for years over multiple OS X versions.  However, upgrading to OS X 10.9 Mavericks broke this setup. ssh login prompts for password. Logging in with password works but I want passwordless key-based authentication.  (I know the solution to this now. Documenting it here in case it helps others.)  <answer107428> Turns out it was about the key file name.  codeauthorized_keys2/code was the correct one to use for SSH2 keys a loooong time ago when I first configured the key-based authentication. For years, codeauthorized_keys2/code file was deprecated but still working. In Mavericks version of opensshd the support has been dropped.  This can be fixed with a simple rename:  precodecd ~/.ssh; mv authorized_keys2 authorized_keys /code/pre  <comment145636> BIG BIG BIG thankyou! I was looking for so long....
