How do I see who's online to my linked Gchat and Facebook Chat in Messages? <body> I had Google Chat and Facebook Chat linked to iChat, but since I upgraded to Mountain Lion I can't see who's online through the bar that used to display along side messaging window. Any ideas?  <answer58220> The sidebar shows your list of open chats. When someone is offline, the text "emOffline/em" shows under their name:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5noQg.png" width="211"  This also depends on whether you have iMessage-enabled contact information for those people â€” it seems that if you do, they never appear as Offline.  (Also note that the buddy list window still works well for seeing who's online!)  <answer58223> Under the window menu you can access all the same contact lists as before (or a unified list if you chose that within Messages preferences)  Command + [a number] is the shortcut to open/close these windows  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bHKjQ.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer58441> I had the same inconvenience but then found it. It's the exact same buddy list you had in iChat:  Command + 1  Or Window - Buddies.
