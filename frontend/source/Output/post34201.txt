iOS Screen recording <body> I'm wondering if there is an Apple policy against screen sharing? My basic use case is similar to the mirroring feature from iPad to Apple TV, except I'm seeking to mirror the device onto a Mac (as opposed to a TV).   What I ultimately need to do is record the actions from a Mac (or PC if that works) that are taking place on an iOS device -- which includes opening the app store; so emulating is not an option. If anyone can think of a clever way to record what's happening on the iOS device, without pointing a camera at it, I'm all ears.  In case anyone comes across this, Quicktime's screen recording + Xcode's emulator should work under normal circumstances. My use case is just more demanding.   <answer34203> The iPhone 4S and iPad 2 can do screen mirroring over HDMI with the Apple AV Adapter. With an HDMI capture card, you could record directly that way. But aside from that (or with hardware other than the 4S or iPad 2), you're probably out of luck if the iOS Simulator doesn't do what you need.  <answer34321> Connect your iPhone with a iPhone to VGA adaptor with a VGA Capture.  Untested.  <answer158481> Starting from iOS8 and Yosemite You can capture the screen of iOS device from Quicktime directly. Here's the steps:  ol liConnect your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch to your Mac via a Lightning Cable./li liOpen the QuickTime app./li liGo to File and select ‘New Movie Recording’./li liA recording window will appear.

Click that arrow and select your iPhone./li liSelect the Mic of your iPhone if you want to record music, app/game sounds./li liClick the Record button. Now perform the tasks on your iOS device that you want to record./li liOnce done tap the stop button and save the video./li liDone!/li /ol  hr NOTE: works only with iOS8 and Yosemite and devices with Lightning Cable.

You just mirror to your PC/Mac and record the iOS device's screen to disk.  1) it's wireless and  2) Higher quality of recording than the QuickTime option on mac  3) you can also livestream to YouTube so I thought it was good to add it as an option. I'm on mac and I choose to do this rather than using quicktime. QuickTime is also good though if you don't care about live streaming to YouTube or better quality for recording.  <answer247733> Mateusz Szlosek answer works great. I'm answering to add an alternative. I record tons of iPad tutorials, and frequently use Pickle Studio (http://picklestud.io). Besides recording the iOS screen, Pickle Studio includes some extra features: you can include partial Mac screens and video camera. It's a bit simple, but works really well. It has some interesting filter options as well.  <comment39019> I knew I should have mentioned that I refuse to buy all the gadgetry to hook it up to a TV. But thanks for the response. <comment254161> I would say this is good for PC. The Mac already includes recording software to record iOS so installing extra seems less ideal to me. http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/158031/recording-ipad-screen-using-quicktime As well as the answer here on QuickTime. <comment254165> Yeah but 1) it's wireless and 2) Higher quality of recording 3) you can also livestream to YouTube so I thought it was good to add it as an option. I'm on mac and I choose to do this rather than using quicktime. QuickTime is also good though. <comment254166> Please add that detail in an edit. +1
