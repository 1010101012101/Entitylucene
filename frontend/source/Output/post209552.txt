Using Automator (or something) to open Safari <body> I think I almost have this solved, but I don't get quite what I would like.  For most websites, I happily use my default browser (Chrome).  However, there is one particular website that just won't work correctly in Chrome.  It works fine in Safari or Firefox, and I have been copying the URL; opening Safari; and then pasting into the location bar.  I thought it would be nice to have a right-click (context menu) option to open a URL in a different browser.    I created a simple Automator service that does uses "New Safari Documents" which almost works.  Unfortunately, Safari opens and stays in the background.  How do I force safari to the front when it does that?   By the way, the real problem is that Chrome won't open the Webex "meeting center". I've cleared cache and reinstalled to no effect.  This seems like a reasonable alternative.  Edit to include Automator script (just one entry): New Safari Documents  It opens if the think I've clicked is a URL.  But it keeps Safari in teh background.  It also does not work if the think I've clicked is a hyperlink with a text name (Like "Click Here").  The service passes the "Click Here" instead of the URL as input to the command.  I've also tried  Launch Application - Safari Wait 2 seconds New Safari Documents  But this one doesn't get the correct input passed into "New Safari Documents".  <comment252775> Could you post what you have in Automator? It might be an easy change to have it pass the URL to a unix script "open" or just tell Safari to activate and move to the foreground... <comment253347> Sure.  It's pretty simple... But I'm not sure how to post one here... <comment253350> You can edit it and then choose the code formatting once you select the script.
