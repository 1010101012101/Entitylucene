Can I increase the level from my USB microphone? <body> I have this usb headset: http://www.plantronics.com/us/product/audio-478  With the level turned all the way up in System Preferences, it's not loud enough for some uses.  Is there a way to increase this level?  10.10.3  2014 15" Retina  <answer180814> You may use volume booster software like  h1Boom/h1  Or   In iTunes Library select media with low volume and press kbdcmd/kbd+kbdi/kbd . Go to Options and make Volume Adjustments.  Or   VLC allow you to increase volume to 200% by simply scrolling all the way up.  <comment214878> on what hardware and what operating system <comment214882> those are for output not for input as asked. <comment214886> Ops, didn't notice the microphone at the end of question. <comment215069> @Buscarì›ƒ I added the info to my question
