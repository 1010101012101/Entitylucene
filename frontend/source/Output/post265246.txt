How to force the items of a window to be well-formed, like in Windows? <body> When I create a folder it will be placed in an irrelevant position to the existing items in that directory, making a mess, killing all aesthetics, whatsoever. How to make the elements to be listed in a grid or something, like for example in Windows? I want this option to be the default.  <answer265272> Perhaps codeFinder menu &gt; View &gt; Show View Options &gt; Sort by: &gt; Snap to Grid/code is what  you're looking for:br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/brvSb.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pvBvo.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment332612> Where is the Menu? =) <comment332613> Click on the Desktop so that Finder appears to the right of the Apple menu. You should see the menu items **File Edit View Go Window Help**. <comment332614> Yeah, that's where I am at, but I cannot see the word "menu" anywhere. :/ <comment332615> I just augmented the answer with a nice graphic. <comment332619> Ah "Finder menu", not go to Finder and then search for Menu...Dah, sorry IconDeamon, but my mind is melting [on this C++](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/41204050/error-no-matching-constructor-for-initialization-of-stdthread) question! Thank.
