How do I make a voice-reply via Apple Watch send, and not delay by a variable amount of time? <body> When I send an iMessage on Apple Watch there is only a "don't send" button, but I have no confirmation if/when this message is actually sent.   Many times when I send a message, later to check the time (within 5 seconds or so), the message is still "pending"  How do I  ul liGet a confirmation that a message was actually sent (as in UX, a whooshing sound, a tap... etc)/li liGet rid of the delay when sending an iMessage.  Sometimes when the message is syntactically correct, I want to just go on doing something else, like checking the HopStop's ETA to my destination./li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XNnCCm.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer278244> After you've dictated your message, you can immediately send it by opening Siri and saying "send".  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GpFpV.png" alt="Sending Apple Watch message immediately with Siri"  You can also say "don't send" to cancel your message.  <comment355517> Did this answer your question?
