Detecting that an external display is plugged in or unplugged on a laptop via bash <body> Is there a way via bash to detect that an external display has been plugged in or unplugged via bash?   I know that I can create a crontab command that fires a script that uses the codesystem_profiler/code command to check and see what displays are currently being used and compare that to some values I store somehwere, but I'm hoping that there is an event that fires when a display is plugged in or unplugged that I could piggy back on so that I'm not having to run the cron job at a frequent enough interval to make the process it preforms happen the "instant" a display is added or removed.   Is there some kind of an event like this that I can hook into?  Thanks
