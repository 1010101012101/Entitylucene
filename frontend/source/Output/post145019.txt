iPhone endlessly syncing <body> Two weeks ago I had my iPhone battery replaced. Before bringing the iPhone to the Apple store I backed up everything on iCloud and reset the phone. After the repair I restored the device and everything works without problems.  The only strange thing is that my iPhone is syncing/restoring since the restore: when attached to Wi-Fi the sync icon is turning and when I leave a known Wi-Fi the phone asks to reactivate Wi-Fi to continue the restore.  Now  ul lieverything seems to be restored (all the apps are there, all photos are there and so on)/li liduring two weeks it would have been possible to restore terabytes of data (my phone was on and on on Wi-Fi most of the time)/li /ul  What is my phone doing? How can I stop the continuous sync?  strongUpdate/strong  Looking at the comments and some research online I tried to  ul lidisable (and reset) iCloud sync of 1Password/li lidisable Voice Memo syncronization/li /ul  without effect.  When connected to the Mac iTunes shows:     Syncing Apps to "Teo's iPhone" (Step 5 of 5)      Waiting for items to copy   <comment170881> Did you reset your 1Password? https://learn2.agilebits.com/1Password4/iOS/Sync/iCloud/ios-icloud-not-working.html and this https://discussions.agilebits.com/discussion/24434/icloud-sync-not-working-properly <comment171021> I tried with no effect. I also disabled the Sync of Voice Memos ... I'll update the question
