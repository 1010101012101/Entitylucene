SSH and Transmit <body> So jailbroke the ipad successfully and tried to ssh into it using terminal and it works. I then tried to change the root and mobile user passwords which also went smoothly. Now when i try to SFTP it using the same credentials using a client like transmit. It fails saying  - The user name or password was not accepted by the server.  The site may be inaccessible or your password may be incorrect. Please double-check your login settings.  <comment95237> Have you tried logging back in via Terminal/ssh since you changed the passwords to make sure you typed everything correctly? <comment95255> Yes tried multiple times and ensured everything was correct and in sync. Still a No-GO for me.Thought is has something to do with this - http://superuser.com/questions/274405/using-ssh-keys-in-transmit-to-connect-via-sftp but still cant figure it out since my keys are stored at the default ~./ssh location.
