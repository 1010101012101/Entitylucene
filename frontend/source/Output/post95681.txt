How can I change OS X Double-Click on Title Bar to be like Windows? <body> I love my Mac eternally but there is one thing I miss from my former Windows days. When I want to toggle between maximize and restore window, on Windows I would double-click the title bar, and that would invoke the toggle.  However with older versions of OS X, a double click on the title bar causes the window to minimize, forcing me to hit F10, then locate the minimized window, then click on it. Too many steps.  Is there any way to make OS X perform the toggle on double-click?  <answer95683> Moom and SizeUp allow setting up keyboard shortcuts for maximizing and restoring windows:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GHFIb.png" alt="" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/H87D4.png" alt=""  I never minimize windows, and I don't use any window management applications either. I think it's easier to just use âŒ˜H and to focus applications with keyboard shortcuts.  <answer125606> i didnt find anything that makes double click - maximize available, but i found using http://hyperdock.bahoom.com/ best alternative (it also gives you active windows preview in your dock on top of window management)  precodeHyperDock brings advanced window management features to Mac OS:  Move &amp; resize windows just by holding down keys and/or moving your mouse. Automatically resize windows when dragging to screen edges (Window Snapping). /code/pre  By default you can snap window to sides/maximize with ctrl + cmd + arrow keys  EDIT:  i actually found a better alternative (even more convinient than windows feature you were asking about).  download better touch tool: http://www.boastr.de/ (free)  add your custom gesture like this (actually you can choose among tons of predefined actions and bind them to key combinations/ trackpad gestures): https://www.dropbox.com/s/ppp1aztfhocvjjv/Screenshot%202014-06-05%2016.09.44.png  <answer133303> You can do it with third-party software  h2BetterSnapTool/h2  App Store ($1.99)  img src="https://i.imgur.com/kaOxk9p.png" alt="Imgur"  <answer216552> codeShift + Dbl-Click/code works perfectly!  <answer220769> Go to Apple icon  System Preferences  Dock  Select "Double-click a window's title bar to" "Zoom", then it should work. As of now yours is minimize.  <answer232153> Its old question , but still if it helps anyone.  You need following 2 in order to maximise your window when clicked on title bar:     ol   liGo to Apple icon  System Preferences  Dock         strongSelect/strong "Double-click a window's title bar to" strong"Zoom"/strong/li   listrongShift + Double click/strong on title bar to maximise the window./li   /ol   Cheers   <answer263521> shift double click works perfectly!! make sure 'click title bar' is set to "zoom"  <comment146972> Can you explain what it does and why it is good rather than in effect just giving a link <comment147066> you're right, done so :) <comment157577> also added a more convenient alternative to the ones i specified before <comment160539> this does not answer the question. <comment171245> Upgrade to Yosemite <comment261930> When I press shift and double click on the title bar, it does a slow animation that minimizes the application to the bottom right. On Windows a double click on the title bar maximizes the window <comment267380> I wish it would maximize to the full screen dimensions, but this is certainly better than nothing! <comment267383> Just realized, combining this answer with shift double click as per Anton Orel, does the job magnificently!
