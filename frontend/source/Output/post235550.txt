Changed Office365 password, cannot change in mail.app: account already exists <body> ul limac os 10.11.4/li limail app 9.3/li /ul  Had a working strongexchange/office365/strong account. Did not work anymore, used safari to go to office365.com and it appeared that I was required to change my password. So I changed it and can login on www.office365.com So the mail.app tells me to change the password, but when I hit save I get: emaccount already exists/em.  So I removed the account from the codesettings/code -- codeinternet accounts/code. closed mail.app, rebooted the mac and tried to add a new exchange account. But again "emaccount already exists/em"  This seems similar to Mac Mail - Account already exists error when adding gmail but iCloud is on a totally different mail account and even a different domain.  Before I removed the exchange account, I manually updated all office365 passwords in the keychain. But that did not work either. Mail.app kept complaining.   Please do not suggest to move to outlook. I have outlook installed, but my boss (owner of the macbook) want to stick to the default mail.app  <answer235558> I have fixed it.   ul liWent to ~/Library/Mail/V2/li liopened the plist xml file in textwrangler /li liremoved all XML nodes containing the office365 accounts /li lisaved the file/li liWent to ~/Library/Mail/V3/li lideleted the folders related to the office365 accounts/li liopened keychain app/li lisearched for codeoffice/code/li liremoved all entries related to the office365 accounts/li liadded the account at the settings - internet accounts page/li /ul  It works then. Strange that removing the account does not clear folders, and xml nodes in a settings file etc. and actually breaks re-adding the account. Perhaps someone can explain why this happened
