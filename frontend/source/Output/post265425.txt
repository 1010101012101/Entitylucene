MS Remote Desktop - drives not mapping - broken by Sierra update 10.12.2? <body> MacOS Sierra running the Microsoft Remote Desktop version code8.0.36/code application connecting to various different MS Windows servers.    Was working fine,  but following the Sierra update 10.12.2 the drives are not mapping,  regardless of the target OS.  Current workaround is to use remote desktop in a VM,  but this is really inconvenient.  emEdit: Feb 2017/em  Another Sierra update,  another broken RDP client.  Microsoft finally updated their RDP client in early January to fix this problem.  Now the Sierra 10.12.3 update's come along and broken it.  So no drive mappings again.  The beta RDP client has too many problems -- I just need a working RDP client -- so have to resort to using a VM running Windosw and it's RDP client.  <answer265528> It's always got to be worth trying the new v8.2 version, currently in beta. I've been using it myself for quite some time &amp; it's a lot better than the current release v8.0 in many respects.

The Beta   app will continue to support both Command X/C/V and Ctrl X/C/V to copy   and paste between the local desktop and remote session.
