OS X: Suddenly only one window/application visible at the same time <body> I have a rather weird problem with my desktop of my MacBook Pro. I use El Capitan 10.11.15.  For reasons I don't know I'm no longer able to keep more than one running application visible at the time.  For example, if I start emTerminal/em, it opens. But when I start emTextEdit/em, Terminal will hide or minimize and emTexEdit/em will become visible instead. The same goes for every other application.  When I open Mission Control, it also shows only one active window, no matter how many other applications are running.  I must have accidently activated it but cannot recall how. I've tried playing around with Dock and Mission Control settings, but nothing changed it.  Does anyone know how to get it back to normal so that I have more than one window/application visible at the same time?  <answer239565> This answer lifted in its entirety from Super User : Snow Leopard desktop - I want two files from two different applications open at the same time. Won't let me     Have you per chance turned on "Single App   Mode"?   This hidden preference causes Mac OS X to hide all applications but   the current active one.      You can tell by running the following command in Terminal.app:  precodedefaults read com.apple.dock single-app /code/pre      If it prints a code0/codethen it is not turned on. If it prints a code1/code then   yes, it is turned on.      You can disable this trick by running:  precodedefaults write com.apple.dock single-app 0 /code/pre   <answer239601> After fiddling around for hours, I found out what had caused this bug. It was one of the strongautostart elements/strong. I don't know exactly which one it was, but after removing all and only adding what I really needed, all worked fine.  <comment294019> Thanks for your answer. I just checked and Terminal told me it was turned off (`0`). Anything else I can try? <comment294021> The only other possibility [however remote] that I can think of is that your Opt/alt key is sticking. <comment294106> I eventually did find it out. The issue was caused by Keyboard Maestro. In its "General Settings", the option "Always Hide Other Applications" must be **unchecked**. Here's a screenshot: http://i.imgur.com/ngOfw7R.jpg
