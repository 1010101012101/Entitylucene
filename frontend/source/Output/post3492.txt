Log out other user w/o first switching to that user <body> My wife use separate accounts and quick user switching on a MBP running 10.6. Sometimes I want to log her out to free up some RAM, but I'd like to avoid logging in as her, logging out, then logging back in as me.  I have seen a terminal solution... is there a better way? Thanks!  <answer3706> Using the Terminal, you can kill her codeloginwindow/code process and any programs she has open will be closed... but strongthis will cause her to lose any unsaved work she has!/strong In fact, emthis is the very reason you need to log in as her to log out:/em When you log in as her, all her programs again have access to the GUI, so they can prompt you to confirm closure, save changes or take other action before logging out.  If you're sure that she only has things like a web browser, iTunes, etc open, not Pages, Word, Photoshop, or anything else with documents, then you could try from the terminal:  precodekill `ps awwwwux | grep her_short_username | grep loginwindow | grep -v grep | awk "{ print \$2 }"` /code/pre  On OSX 10.10.4: (slight edit from last comment):   precodeexport pn=`ps awwwwux | awk '/her_short_username/ &amp;&amp; /loginwind[o]w/ { print $2 }'` sudo kill -9 $pn /code/pre  <answer33132> You can stronguse the Activity Monitor/strong to log another user out by killing their login process:  ol liRun Activity Monitor/li liIn the filter at the top-right, type codeloginwindow/code/li liClick the row with the user's name in the emUser/em column/li liClick emQuit Process/em, then emForce Quit/em, and type your password./li /ol  This is just a nicer(?) GUI version of Josh's answer.  Before step 2, you can review the other user's running processes to see if they are running any apps that might lose data on logout.  <answer33137> In my opinion, the possible loss of data far outweights the possible gain in RAM.  Moreover, it has been a long time since Unix was able to swap memory to disk when a process was idle.  <answer270691> This command is simpler than the one suggested and it will have the desire result to kill all the user's processes (I had to run it twice)  codesudo pkill -9 -u user/code  If you just want to kill the loginwindow process for that user you can do the following:  codesudo pkill -9 -u user loginwindow/code  <answer287066> I think the simplest way of doing it is :  sudo killall -9 -u emwifes_name/em   <comment3191> You need to better define "is there a better way". For me, not much (computer-wise) is better than a terminal. If you want an app, just wrap the terminal command in an automator or applescript app. <comment3192> @mankoff, good point! But this isn't an Arch Linux forum, so let's assume I want a GUI/built-in solution :). But, you're right, I can just write a shell script. <comment3193> Here is the link to the script solution (I saw it before posting, but it's from 2005, so I assumed that by now this simple feature must have been incorporated into the GUI).  http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=118545 <comment3194> there is no built-in gui solution that i know of... <comment3195> OK, thanks, All! When I write a good script, I'll post it back here. <comment3482> Agree with the warning that if you don't log in to see what she's doing, then you don't know what you might cost her by logging her out. <comment3491> Yeah, you're right. Most of the time it's web-browsing... But one time it won't be! Thanks! <comment21056> If you force-terminate her `loginwindow` through `Activity Monitor.app` you could conveniently glance at the same time what other processes she has left open. <comment208352> One problem is that when a user is switched out, their processes may not be idle. They may be chewing up CPU and memory. Games seem particularly bad in this respect. <comment232835> If you end up running Awk anyway, the multiple `grep` commands can easily be avoided.  `ps awwwwux | awk '/her_short_username/ && /loginwind[o]w/ { print $2 }Â | xargs kill` and see also http://www.iki.fi/era/unix/award.html#grep <comment232899> That's a much better command line @tripleee, I agree. My awk wasn't as good 5 years ago :-) <comment236017> Question mentions the wife, but there is actually an even better case - when you have a child that has exceed their time limit for the day and only plays games and does other things that don't need saving.  Now not only do you have to log in as the kid but add time just to log them out. <comment241946> Wives and RAMs can't pleasure you together. You have to choose one. Now where's the script <comment243357> @Michael That is exactly _my_ use case. :) <comment250461> just fix a typo in your updated command, reads `sudu` should read `sudo`. <comment357770> Is that 10.10.4 only, or 10.10.4 and up?
