Change Terminal Theme for Developing <body> I just got an iMac and wanted to change the default terminal to, what i believe, is a theme.  I saw it a while ago and i'm not finding it.  Screenshot below.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NhNwy.png" alt="enter image description here"  You can find a video from Yeoman using it here  <answer110066> The closest I've found is the Steeef theme for oh-my-zsh. It seems very close, except the font/background is different (however that is set externally in Terminal settings).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jCEGg.png"  To install this:  ol liInstall Homebrew and zsh, then set zsh as default shell.  precoderuby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go)" brew install zsh chsh -s /usr/local/bin/zsh /code/pre/li liRestart Terminal./li liInstall oh-my-zsh.  precodecurl -L https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/raw/master/tools/install.sh | sh /code/pre/li liEdit codeZSH_THEME/code in code~/.zshrc/code to be codesteeef/code.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/T3iex.png" width="250"/li liRestart Terminal./li /ol  <comment129683> I think the screenshot is pretty similar. Can you help me installing it ? I'm pretty new to mac's :) <comment129686> @TheMiniJohn I've edited my answer :) <comment129687> Hey i finished Step 3, but i can't find ~/.zshrc. How can i find and open this file ? <comment129688> @TheMiniJohn It's a hidden file in the root of your home directory. If you have TextMate (with CLI) installed, you can run `mate ~/.zshrc`. Alternatively, you can edit it in Terminal with nano using `nano ~/.zshrc`. If you want to unhide the file to show it in Finder (to edit it with TextEdit etc) run `chflags nohidden ~/.zshrc`. <comment129689> nano worked. Thanks a Lot !!!!  :)
