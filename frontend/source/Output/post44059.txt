Can I remove the clip of the iPod nano 6G? <body> Is there a (non-brute-force) way to remove the clip-part of the iPod nano 6G? I find, I don't use it and it add clunkiness. Also it's a bit scratched since it's the only part not protected by a silicone wrapper.  <answer44063> h2It's very tricky./h2  You have to disassemble the whole iPod nano as the strongguide for clip removal on iFixit/strong shows.  This is a picture taken from the second last step:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tAI2p.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment50239> Great answer. But way too fancy for me :)
