How can I disable the firewall on OS X after forgetting how I set it? <body> I have enabled an option on my mac to ask for permission every time I open an network application, But I can't seem to find out how to turn it off.  Where would I disable the below dialog?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DcjxW.png" alt="dialog"  <answer82491> As the dialog explains, you can turn off the firewall in the Security preferences pane (or Security &amp; Privacy, on newer versions of OS X).  <comment95168> Would you like to disable the firewall entirely, or just whitelist that one app?
