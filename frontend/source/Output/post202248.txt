In the meantime i didn't used my phone so is there a battery issue or some thing else???  <answer202252> Apple has a battery replacement program for iPhone 5. You can check eligibility on this Apple page     Apple has determined that a very small percentage of iPhone 5 devices may suddenly experience shorter battery life or need to be charged more frequently. The affected iPhone 5 devices were sold between September 2012 and January 2013 and fall within a limited serial number range. (...)      The program covers affected iPhone 5 batteries for two years after the first retail sale of the unit or until March 1, 2015, whichever provides longer coverage.   <answer202257> First, check to see what application is consuming battery power. To check this, open SettingsGeneralUsage. Under Battery, touch 'Battery Usage'. After some loading time, you will see a list of Applications that have used Battery power in the last 24 hrs and last 7 days. If there is an application using a significant percentage of power that you have not used, you may wish to kill that app or restart your iPhone.  Specifically to the iPhone 5, see @Tetsujin response on extended warranty from Apple.  <comment244012> Definitely, the iPhone 5 is notorious for that.
