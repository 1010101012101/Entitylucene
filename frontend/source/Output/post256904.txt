Increase iPhone call history <body> How can see call history in iPhone one month back, i also tried with tried party software but that is not perfect , is the any solution from apple?  <answer256932> You can't. iPhone call history is limited to the last 100 entries. Older entries are hidden but they might be available through a 3rd-party app.  <comment320549> Mine goes back 2 months. It might be carrier-dependant.
