Unable to repartition my data disk <body> Last week I started having problems with my Mac (a mid-2010 Mac Pro running OS X El Captain), after searching for the cause I realized my OS X partition was corrupt.  A while back I turned on FileVault, and 2-3 weeks later all of a sudden my Mac started slowing down. In the end, 5 minutes after booting up my Mac simply froze, I wasn't able to do anything any more.  I decided to reinstall OS X but to my horror I realized that I couldn't select my original disk any more. No matter what I tried (I even booted up using a Windows 10 install disk to remove all the partitions on the disk) , I couldn't get OS X to reinstall on the same disk.  I finally gave up, installed it on the 2nd disk, installed Paragon Hard Disk Manager which allowed me to finally create a new partition on the disk, and started using it as a data disk.  I thought I had solved the problem, until I wanted to turn on encryption on the disk. I got an error message, which Google told me meant I didn't have an EFI partition on the disk.  So I googled around for a solution, found one but it made everything worse. Now even Paragon Hard Disk Manager can't create a working partition any more.  So... How do I clean up this mess? I have a working OS X install, I just want to create another partition on my other disk and encrypt it...  How can I fix this?

Probably the partition Paragon app tried to create:  precode/dev/disk1 (internal, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE               IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk1    1:       Microsoft Basic Data                         1.0 TB     disk1s1 /code/pre  I'm not certain the disk isn't failing, but my current problem started after me trying to recreate the EFI partition, so I'm assuming it's still a logical problem rather than an actual hardware problem.  <answer250088> To enable FileVault on a non-system disk you need an EFI partition, an HFS+ volume and a Boot OS X partition. The last one will be built while enabling FileVault.  Your disk contains none of them.  Open Disk Utility (in /Applications/Utilities), choose the appropriate disk (not any inferior volume!) and hit erase in the toolbar.  Choose a name, "OS X Extended (Journaled)" as format and "GUID Partition Map" as scheme. Then hit the erase button.  If the partitioning fails, close Disk Utility and open Terminal.app. Enter codediskutil list/code. Then enter codesudo gpt -r show diskX/code with diskX: the disk identifier of the stubborn disk. Below I assume the identifier is emdisk1/em.  If you are sure that you have chosen the stubborn disk (I.e. the one with the em2048  1953519616      1  GPT part - EBD0A0A2-B9E5-4433-87C0-68B6B72699C7/em partition) enter:  precodediskutil umountDisk disk1 sudo gpt destroy disk1 /code/pre  Enter codeexit/code to terminate the Terminal session and quit Terminal. Open Disk Utility again and repeat the steps to partition the disk mentioned earlier.  <comment310319> How certain are you that the drive itself isn't failing? <comment310328> Please start Terminal.app and enter `diskutil list`. Now search for the disk identifier of the stubborn internal disk (e.g. disk0). Enter `sudo gpt -r show diskX` (with diskX: the disk identifier of the internal disk) and add the result to your question by editing it. <comment310428> Since I already tried to recreate the partition using the Disk Utility I skipped this part and immediately went to the next step. After executing the commands and rebooting my system I finally maged to recreate my partitions :) <comment310429> @Fysicus The hardware of your disk may still be corrupted though. I try to find an appropriate tool. I'm using a tool called [Scannerz](http://scsc-online.com/Scannerz.html),  which isn't free. <comment310465> I'll run a scan then. I just hope I don't have to replace my disk. :(
