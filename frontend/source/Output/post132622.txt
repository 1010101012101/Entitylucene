Restoring data from Time Machine backup created on second Mac <body> I have a desktop Mac and MacBook Air.  The MacBook Air has decided to die, so I want to restore the back up files in my Time Machine to my Mac desktop.   How do I do that?  It must be simple, but I can only get into the data for my Mac desktop.  <answer132623> ⌥ alt/option-click the Time Machine icon in the menu bar and keep the key held whilst selecting Browse Other Backup Disks….  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mMgLX.png" width="288"  From there, you can select the other Mac and copy files.  <comment157075> Thanks for you quick reply but i only see select disk... no browse other backup disks... <comment157076> @Barbara Are you selecting it from the menu bar? I've added a screenshot <comment157077> my menu bar under the latest backup and date says...Back-up now... Enter Time Machine...open ™ preferences <comment157078> @BarbaraFranken are you clicking on the small circle with clock <comment157080> @Buscar Yes, those are the correct options <comment157081> @Barbara You need to hold alt (⌥) whilst clicking the option, and keep it held whilst you select the option. <comment157087> ok got that now thanks but still showing only one disk which is my mac... do you think they are all mixed up in this one disk?  sorry but i'm quite a dummy...
