iCal DAV The Server Responded with an Error (HTTP 302) after sleeping <body> Often when my Macbook Pro Retina has been asleep, I get the following upon waking up:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OGro5.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  It is irritating because I get the bouncy iCal icon in my doc and have to dismiss the error message every time. Anyone know how to prevent this?  <answer90137> Several things could cause this, but you could eliminate or reduce the chance by doing any or all of the following:  ol liTurn off all networking before sleeping./li liReduce the refresh time period for that calendar to avoid it refreshing while the system is waking or getting re-connected with an available network./li liQuit Calendar before sleeping./li liMove the calendar to another hosting site (assuming it's not really the Mac that's causing the http error.)/li /ol
