How to store note only on my Mac in Notes 4? <body> I'm trying the new Notes.app version 4 with El Capitan. I "upgraded" my existing data to be compatible wit the newly revamped version of this app.  I have an "iCloud" group on the left panel, with a couple folders. But I do not have an "On my Mac" group.   So how do I store notes only on my Mac rather than through iCloud?  <answer213111> h1Choose codeNotes/code  code"On My Mac" Account/code/h1  I have just opened Notes on El Capitan to verify this. Please click on strongNotes/strong in the menu bar, then click on code"On My Mac" Account/code to access the local storage facility. The new group will appear upon clicking this option.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9KsDR.png" alt="Notes"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3gwiK.png" alt="Group"  <comment257314> Yes, this is a solution. <comment257316> @BasilBourque Good to hear it's worked!
