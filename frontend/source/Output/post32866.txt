How do I assure that all files from a shared HFS+ drives are always writable by all users? <body> I have a shared drive on a Mac and I keep having problems accessing different directories.  For example, while logged on the server as root I create a new folder codeaaa/code on this drive.  Now, I discover that a normal user cannot write to this directory.  Is there a way for me to change the default permissions/ACLs so I prevent this from happening in the future.  I am looking for a one-time solution, not running codechmod/code or codechown/code each time.  Details:   ul liit seems that coderoot/code is not member of codestaff/code group because when I do codels -l/code I see group code_unknown/code listed for files created by root./li liBy default the files do get only xr write for the group (codedrwxr-xr-x/code), how can I change so the group will have the same rights as the user, by default?/li liCan this be changes per mounted volume or directory, or changing this would affect the entire system? Risks?/li /ul  <answer32889> Get Info on said drive and checking Ignore Ownership might help you.
