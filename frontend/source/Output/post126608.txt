Cydia apps gone after install and respring <body> I installed Overboard from Cydia and after respring all my Cydia apps are gone!  There is no Cydia section in Settings. I have reinstalled Cydia Substrate and PreferenceLoader, but nothing happened.  <answer126609> Go into Safe Mode using a tweak or by rebooting whilst holding volume up. Once booted, open Cydia and uninstall Overboard, then respring. If the icons still don't show, ssh into your device as mobile and run codeuicache/code then respring.  <answer129498> I had this problem recently.  Uninstalling 'libhide' from cydia did the trick (they were all there, just the hiding function had got a little excited...)   <answer184594> Uninstall AppSync, it worked for me.  <answer184599> Reboot the device a few times. It worked for me. Had to do it 3 times though.   <answer271444> I found a way to get my apps back.  ol liI downloaded codeifile.ipa/code and Cydia Impactor/li liI opened the Cydia Impactor and then dragged &amp; dropped the codeifile.ipa/code onto it, waited for it to be installed on my phone/li liOnce it finished I opened iFile on my phone. /li liIn iFile I went to codevar/mobile/library/caches/com.saurik.cydia/code and then I deleted that folder (codecom.saurik.cydia/code)/li liI exited iFile and all the missing apps appeared back on my home screen./li /ol  I hope this helps!    <answer271543> removing Appsync fixed it on 10.2 Yalu/b6.  Additionally SSH was not working over wifi so I used the python script @ http://www.hackthatphone.com/5x/open_ssh_usb.shtml to ssh over USB, then used dselect (you can just use an 'apt' command) to remove the troublesome tweak. Forgot how to restring over ssh so restarted and issue resolved. re-jailbroke and a ok.  <comment148446> Thx , it worked :) <comment218898> Welcome to Ask Different.
