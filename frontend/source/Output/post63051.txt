Terminal won't receive Control+← or Control+→ <body> I just upgraded to Mountain Lion and I'm perplexed to find that neither iTerm 2 or the standard terminal will not receive kbdControl ⌃/kbd+kbd←/kbd or kbd⌃/kbd+kbd→/kbd, which I typically use to jump words on the command line. I can, however, use kbd⌃/kbd+kbd↑/kbd and kbd⌃/kbd+kbd↓/kbd which I'm finding odd.  I've tested this by opening up codecat/code on stdin and mashing buttons. My initial guess is that OS X is intercepting them somehow, I suspected Spaces (I guess it's part of Mission Control now) at first, but after disabling all key combinations for it, I've come up empty-handed.  Has anyone ever seen this before, or does anyone have any other ideas?  <answer63057> kbdoption/kbdkbdf/kbd - Jump Forward a Word  kbdoption/kbdkbdb/kbd - Jump Back a Word  From the bash manpage:   precode   forward-word (M-f)          Move forward to the end of the next word.

It may be possible to modify that, or I would suggest emduplicating/em it, using codecontrol cursor left/code with the same code\033b/code action, and codecontrol cursor right/code with code\033f/code.  <answer63065> This is because kbdctrl/kbd+kbd&larr;/kbd and kbdctrl/kbd+kbd&rarr;/kbd are bound to changing spaces in strongMission Control/strong.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zy6iU.png" alt="Keyboard Shortcuts"  <comment72792> This doesn't help that the terminal won't respond to ^← or ^→. I know how to bind keys to actions, but I don't know why the terminal isn't responding to the keys being pressed. <comment72814> The OP's question indicates that he's removed those shortcuts. <comment72815> I think you should file a [Radar](https://bugreport.apple.com/) that even when you disable the shortcut, something still traps it. <comment91332> I can verify that Terminal will respond to Control-Left/Right if they aren't intercepted elsewhere. The default Terminal keyboard map even includes mappings for them, and they work if I turn off the Mission Control shortcuts.
