How do I use a second iCloud account with Messages? <body> I have two iCloud accounts, one for work, one personal. My iPhone is connected to my personal account, but at work I log into my work account.  For a while, any text messages I received on my iPhone also appeared in Messages and I was able to respond that way as well. I really liked that feature.  The problem is, I don't know how I turned it on before. I had to reset my phone last week, and now I can't get my text messages in Messages any more.
