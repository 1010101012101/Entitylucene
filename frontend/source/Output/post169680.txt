Does Windows, running on latest Apple computers, see boot disk partitioned as MBR or GPT? <body> From my understanding, the newest apple computers boot Windows in EFI mode. Traditionally, Windows has seen the boot disk as an MBR partitioned disk. In fact, the boot disk (i.e. /dev/disk0) has aways been partitioned as a GPT disk. I would like confirm there has been a change.  To be specific, open a Command Prompt as an Administrator and enter the following:  precodediskpart list disk exit /code/pre     Note: When entering the codediskpart/code command, it can take a while before the first prompt appears. This is normal. Be patient, the codeDISKPART&gt;/code prompt will appear.   What I am looking for a * in the Gpt column for Disk 0. strongIf Disk 0 is seen as an GPT partitioned disk, then Windows has booted using the EFI boot method. Otherwise, Windows has booted using the legacy BIOS boot method./strong An example, using an older apple (iMac/20 inch/Mid 2007), is shown below:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bhCKZ.png" alt="Example of diskpart command"  In the above illustration, Disk 0 is the internal hard disk partitioned as a GPT disk. To Windows it appears as an MBR partitioned disk, indicated by the absence of the * in the Gpt column. Disk 1 is a GPT partitioned USB thumb (flash) drive containing a single NTFS partition.   If you show a * in the Gpt column for Disk 0, could you report back the "model identifier" or "model/screen size/year" of your apple computer. It may also be useful to include the version of Windows and OS X you are using. Apple recommends a standard where there is one partition for OS X and a second Boot Camp partition for Windows. If you are using a nonstandard partitioning scheme, try to indicate how you differed.   <answer169689> If you install Windows with the Bootcamp Assistant from a standard Mac OS X system, Windows always will start from a PMBR/Hybrid MBR partition table embedded in the GUID partition table  (Legacy MBR). MBR takes precedence in hybrid configuration even if a EFI boot might be possible.  If you use a non-Bootcamp Assistant EFI install method for Windows (e.g outlined here) Windows will boot in UEFI-mode (compatibility Windows 32bit/64bit) and you will find a * in the Gpt column for disk0.  <comment255744> Do you know a comprehensive partition/disk editor/disk info/system info tool which presents more informations than just a (gpt) star for Windows? <comment255810> @klanomath: gdisk works with windows, but I have never tried this version. The Windows graphical tool is call Disk Management. It can be launched various ways. See this [link](http://www.softwareok.com/?seite=faq-Windows-8&faq=9). Personally, I wrote my own windows command line tool to do a text dump of the GPT contents. <comment255849> Is the command line tool you wrote available anywhere? I'm asking because I have a spare MacBook Air (mid 2013) at the moment and while trying to answer [this](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/211778/help-partitioning-free-space-with-utility-disk/211812) question I realized that I had no problem to create more than 4 partitions without losing the ability to boot to Windows. My mbr is empty except the pmbr. And I need a tool to inspect that further. <comment278746> @klanomath: For whatever its worth, I posted the command line tools at [sourceforge.net](https://sourceforge.net/projects/readgpt/?source=directory).
