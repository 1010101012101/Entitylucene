Third and fourth monitors disconnect on reboot <body> Yosemite 10.10.2 (14C109)  I have four monitors connected to my mac pro. One connected to the HDMI port, one connected with a passive (single link) DVI connector and two connected with dual-link DVI adaptors (the ones with the USB power and thunderbolt connectors). When I reboot, the dual link adaptors are disconnected until I unplug and replug their USB parts. The HDMI and passive DVI connected monitors are always active on reboot.   What a pain to get under the desk to reconnect the monitors.  Apple support techs send me to http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202801 which doesn't address this problem.  What can I do to get the third and fourth monitors to work immediately on reboot?  <comment206560> I have the same issue. Works on mavericks but not yosemite. Phoned apple 3 time. They " logging" the problem
