Is it possible to find the serial number of stolen devices using a Mac that they've been connected to? <body> For a number of devices that were stolen, can I find their serial number on a Mac that I still have and which the devices have been connected to at some point? In other words, are there any applications (or the OS) which might have kept a record of any of these devices' serial number(s)? I'm specifically thinking about:  ul liiPod/li liCinema Display/li liTime Capsule/li lianother Mac/li lia camera/li /ul  Would the connections have shown up in a log file somewhere with their serial number included? At least for an iPod, I wouldn't be surprised if its serial number gets recorded by iTunes somewhere. And iPhoto just might record a camera's as well.  <answer6398> strongHow to get serial numbers for displays:/strong  Go to code/Library/Preferences/com.apple.windowserver.plist/code. Open this with TextWrangler or a similar utility. Look for a codeDisplaySerialNumber/code key with an integer value that isn't 0. With any luck, this should be the s/n of your display.br emIf you haven't used this display for a while, the records of it may be gone./embr emAlso, it appears that this isn't guaranteed.

Also, the iPod plist in code~/Library/Preferences/code contains serial numbers.  <comment6684> The Bluetooth file just refers to a serial port. TM doesn't show up on mine. Trying another backup now to see if it appears. <comment6687> Any idea how the DisplaySerialNumber field in the file "com.apple.windowserver.plist" relates to the serial number as found on the display itself? I've managed to find my display's serial number in an old e-mail to Apple support, and I've also found entries for the display in the file. The two numbers do look somewhat similar, but they're not exactly the same. (For one, the real serial number contains digits and letters, while the field in the file only has digits. Some digits appear in one that are not in the other.) <comment6688> Sorry to hear it. I guess it strips alpha characters for efficiency. The reason for it to keep the number is just so that it knows which display to put a window on, and I guess it doesn't need the whole thing to keep it straight. <comment6689> Still no TM on mine.
