What does "[Update Needed]" mean when attempting to boot from an encrypted backup? <body> When I attempt to boot from an external drive that is an encrypted SuperDuper! mirror of my internal hard drive, I get a login screen that's missing my account an instead has an account called "[Update Needed]", with no user picture.  I understand that this is a known issue with FileVault, but it is not clear from what I've read whether it is necessary to do anything about this, or if it can just be ignored (after all, the disk is a backup, and the source seems fine).  Can I just ignore this and deal with it when and if I need to use the backup? Is this a sign of problems on the source drive that just aren't showing symptoms there yet (that drive is not, yet, encrypted)?  <answer62305> Try this: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3321886?start=0&amp;tstart=0  ul liTo begin, make a backup./li liDisable FileVault./li liCheck for updates again./li liApply update if possible./li liBoot into recovery mode by holding kbdCommand ⌘/kbd-kbdR at startup./li liRun Repair Disk Permissions in Disk Utility./li liEnable FileVault again./li /ul  <answer80122> h1[Update Needed]/h1  This may also appear on an codeApple_Boot/code slice (partition) that is not updated according to the list of users who are enabled for FileVault 2.   hr  h2Visualising changes to an Apple_Boot slice/h2  This first screenshot, from Mountain Lion, shows changes to the file system after using the Startup Disk pane of System Preferences – without a change of preference.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/k7FEI.png" alt="fseventer view of changes to the file system"  Critically:   ul lichanges were whilst booted from a startup volume named emOS/em/li lichanges were to the file system on a strongseparate volume/strong named emBoot OS X/em – on the codeApple_Boot/code slice. /li /ul  The two shots below are more relevant.
