osascript and AppleEvents <body> I logged the AppleEvents that get sent from a Terminal window. The event that the codeosascript/code command sends to the AppleScript compiler/interpreter wasn't logged. How come?  In greater detail, the following argument consists of three hypotheses followed by their logical conclusion. However, experiment shows that the conclusion is false. Hence the argument is faulty. Unfortunately, I don't know why it is faulty. Where does it break?  strongHypotheses/strong  ol limacOS comes with a built-in AppleScript compiler/interpreter that is installed as an OSA component./li liThe Terminal command codeosascript/code does not "know" AppleScript.
