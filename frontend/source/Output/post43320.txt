How can I set the double-click speed in Lion with a multi-touch trackpad? <body> In Snow Leopard and earlier (or perhaps the difference was with the hardware; I don't know which as I updated my computer and OS simultaneously), there was a preference under Trackpad to change the speed needed to perform a double-click. How can I speed it up now that it isn't there?  <answer43324> In Lion, the trackpad double-click speed slider and a few other trackpad options have been moved to: codeSystem Preferences &gt; Universal Access &gt; Mouse &amp; Trackpad &gt; Trackpad Options/code.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ps1cD.png" alt="Track Pad double click speed"  <comment49227> So that's where it went! I actually went to that tab of that pane in looking for it, but I didn't click on that button. Silly me. ;) <comment49260> No Silly Apple, that makes no sense to be there
