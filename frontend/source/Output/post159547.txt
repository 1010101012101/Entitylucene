How to identify an iOS hotspot from the command line? <body> Is it possible from the command line to identify whether the current Wi-Fi connection, or a detected SSID, is an iOS personal/instant hotspot?   I know OS X can detect this, as it shows a specific "hotspot" icon in the topbar when scanning the list of SSIDs or when being connected to an iPhone (see screenshot)   I tried using code/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport -I/code and codeifconfig/code but I'm not able to find information that helps me identify an iOS hotspot. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/z5pIk.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment231739> Did you find an answer?
