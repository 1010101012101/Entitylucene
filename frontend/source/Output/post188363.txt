MMS can not send to Android phone: gets iMessage error <body> This has happened twice, with two different Android recipients.  Both have been Android phones since inception - read: never had iMessage, so Apple shouldn't be confused about iMessage.  Anyway, we've had recent failures sending pics to Android phones we've sent pics before.  We get:  precodeCannot Send Message iMessage needs to be enabled to send this message /code/pre  iMessage emis/em enabled.  So, I tried a phone bounce, disabling/re-enabling iMessages, disabling/re-enabling MMS.  Disabling/re-enabling WiFi (TMobile, allows WiFi as an SMS/MMS transport). No good.  A simple text message worked tho.  just no pics  Tips?  EDIT: versions would be nice.  iOS 8.3.  iPhone 6.  UPDATE: I was able to send by sending to a new MMS group; the intended recipient and an iMessage account.  <comment230496> I have the same issue, but cannot recieve MMS and also group messages fail <comment230562> @JonathanLeaders I got it to work, not sure how :(. Maybe have them send you a message. It may reset some "has iMessage" flag locally on your phone.
