Why does Safari not use its notifications preferences? <body> I have some websites which have been given permission to use Notification Center, but Safari ignores its own notifications preferences.  When you give a site permission, some will create a new set of preferences, and this appears in the list just like any other app. But many do not, and they still can deliver notifications. But here Safari ignores its own preferences for notifications.  Instead, it just shows Banners, that disappear shortly and leave no trace.  Is this a bug?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zWcXI.png" alt="Safari Notification Settings"
