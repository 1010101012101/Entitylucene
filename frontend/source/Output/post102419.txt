Global shortcut for New Mail in Thunderbird <body> I would like to have a global shortcut key to send a new message using Thunderbird in Mac OS. How can I do this?  <answer102440> You can assign a keyboard shortcut to a script like this:  precodetell application "Thunderbird"     reopen     activate end tell tell application "System Events" to tell process "Thunderbird"     repeat 10 times         try             click menu item "Message" of menu 1 of menu item "New" of menu "File" of menu bar 1             return         on error             delay 0.1         end try     end repeat end tell /code/pre  If Thunderbird was not open before the script was run, there is a short delay before the menu bar is populated.  Edit: this does not reopen the main window sor switch desktops if the main window is already open on a different desktop/s:  precodelaunch application "Thunderbird" tell application "System Events" to tell process "Thunderbird"     repeat 10 times         try             click menu item "Message" of menu 1 of menu item "New" of menu "File" of menu bar 1             exit repeat         on error             delay 0.1         end try     end repeat     set frontmost to true end tell /code/pre  Edit 2: The second script also emsometimes/em switches desktops, but I couldn't figure out how to prevent it.  <comment120809> Thanks, this mostly works, but still has the problem that the workspace changes and that the main Thunderbird window reopens. I just would like to have a new message window in the current workspace. <comment120812> @anumi I edited the answer to add a second script. <comment121222> The second solution does not reopen the main window, but still switches workspaces. But that's an improvement!
