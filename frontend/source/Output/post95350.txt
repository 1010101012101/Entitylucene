Which country in Europe offers Macbook Air 13" with US keyboard (with wide enter)? <body> I would like to buy a strongMacbook Air/strong, but I don't like the small and narrow kbdEnter/kbd (return) key, small left kbdShift/kbd and the extra keys that you can buy in Czech stores/eshops that sell Apple products.  This is what I do NOT like: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zZu1e.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  And this is what I want: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JXTmS.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  I really hate the small kbdEnter/kbd and the small left kbdShift/kbd and the extra keys. Could somebody help me where in Europe (which country) or maybe in nearby regions (North Africa, Israel or maybe some country in the Middle East) can I buy Macbook Air 13" with US keyboard?  <answer95352> What about store.apple.com?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/viBU0.jpg" alt="" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QyFgX.jpg" alt=""  I have bought two Macs with a US keyboard from the Finnish store. US means the standard US layout with a single row return key. The International English and UK layouts have a two row return key.  You can probably get them from eBay as well.  <comment111836> A few years ago it wasn't possible, but now the Swiss Apple Store offers English keyboards with *any* Mac, don't you have that option in the Czech Apple store? There are 3 Apple retail stores in Switzerland: in Zurich, Geneva and Wallisellen, consult this link: http://www.apple.com/retail/storelist/ for more information. <comment113837> Hardware shopping questions are off-topic. You'll want to edit this to encourage an answer that teaches people how things are built rather than asking someone to find you the part you want. <comment209454> Funny. I really hate the one-row enter key.
