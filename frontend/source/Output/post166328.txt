not using free data allowance <body> I have a 5Gig data allowance on my phone and I hardly ever use more than a fraction of it.  But I seem to be paying a lot through my broadband provider.  How can I persuade my phone to use my free data allowance?! It's an iphone and I have a vodafone plan.  <answer166334> To use cellular data, disable Wi-Fi. This may impact location services.
