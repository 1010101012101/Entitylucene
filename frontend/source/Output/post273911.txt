Deleting entries in defaults <body> I have accidentally added an entry to my defaults (em/usr/bin/defaults/em) that is preventing me from installing apps via iTunes. How do I undo my change?  This is the command to read the offending entry:  precode/usr/bin/defaults read /Library/Preferences/com.apple.usbmuxd /code/pre  Which gives the following result:  precode{     BlackList =     (         "com.apple.iTunes"     ); } /code/pre  It was added by  precode/usr/bin/defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.usbmuxd BlackList -array-add com.apple.iTunes /code/pre  I thought this would remove it, but I can't figure it out.   precode/usr/bin/defaults delete /Library/Preferences/com.apple.usbmuxd BlackList com.apple.iTunes /code/pre  This just returns the help for defaults  Here are a few more things I've tried and the results  precode/usr/bin/defaults delete /Library/Preferences/com.apple.usbmuxd BlackList Domain (/Library/Preferences/com.apple.usbmuxd) not found.  /usr/bin/defaults delete /Library/Preferences/com.apple.usbmuxd com.apple.iTunes Domain (/Library/Preferences/com.apple.usbmuxd) not found. /code/pre  Not sure what the "Domain not found" error is. I tried sudo as well and saw the same error message. Is that not the domain I just added to with the initial write step?  I think this is the command in defaults I want to use:  precodedelete &lt;domain&gt; &lt;key&gt;                deletes key in domain /code/pre  <answer273912> You can delete the BlackList array with  pre class="lang-bash prettyprint-override"codedefaults delete /Library/Preferences/com.apple.usbmuxd BlackList #        delete &lt;domain&gt;                               &lt;key&gt; /code/pre  Apple doesn't provide an easy way to remove an array element. You can either set the BlackList array with code-array/code with the item excluded, or edit the file manually using Xcode for example.  <comment344329> Looks right to me, the same thing I tried above, although I still get the same error of not finding the domain. <comment344330> @Swim Domain not found means that file `/Library/Preferences/com.apple.usbmuxd.plist` can't be found. Does the file exist? Does using `defaults read` on that file still work? Did you do `defaults delete /Library/Preferences/com.apple.usbmuxd` without anything else on the end at some point? <comment344332> Reading still works. I looked at the file in xcode like you suggested (good suggestion! I'm new to mac and didn't realize that was possible.) -- When trying to edit in xcode, I get a permission error. I did a sudo chmod 777, but it still had a permission error when trying to delete the entry in xcode. <comment344337> Above, I should say instead of Reading works, say reading still returns the BlackList with com.apple.iTunes entry.
