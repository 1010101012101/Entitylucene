Adjust/move table in TextEdit <body> I know that I can adjust any row height / column width in RTF document by hovering their borders and dragging them. But it seems that I can't do it for the first column... Is there a way to kind of "tab in" tables (adjust the first column's border to the right) in TextEdit? At least by editing RTF sources...   If I can't, maybe that's not the right place to ask, but are there other word processors  with scalable / practically (possibly) infinite line width in RTF (like web pages, not divided into pages)? This "Moving" tables is also necessary.
