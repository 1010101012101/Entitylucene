Can I turn off pages auto correct for just subscripted and superscripted text? <body> Is there a way to turn off auto correct in pages only for things that are subscripted or superscripted, or would I have to completely turn off auto correct?  For example is there a way for it to stop auto correcting t subscript setup without completing turning off auto correct or adding all of the subscripts to the dictionary.
