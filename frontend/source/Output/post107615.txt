I've found this within five minutes: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/57916/how-do-you-remove-safari-6-on-mac-os-x-10-7-4 <comment126200> This still leaves the question where to get 6.0.2 from. <comment126203> Yes I did research, the link that you speak of states: <comment126204> If you are currently running Mountain Lion, or have installed a more recent version of Safari 6 (released anytime after Oct 2012) then you may encounter serious problems when attempting to follow these instructions. I did research, perhaps you misread what you found. <comment126965> Why do you want to downgrade? WHat problems have been introduced by 6.1?
