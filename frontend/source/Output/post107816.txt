Does free iWork on iOS entitle me to free iWork to Mac? <body> I have recently become the proud owner of a new iPhone 5s and have benefitted from the free iWork apps that are available to new devices.  I also own a 2012 MacBook Pro running Mavericks. Now I have the iWork apps on my iPhone, does it entitle me to them on my Mac via 'purchased' or are they different apps altogether being on different platforms?  <answer107818> Actually no, iOS and OSX version of iWorks are 2 different softwares although linked by iCloud (AppStore &amp; Mac AppStore "are" independent). iWork for OSX is free for every Mac bought after October 1st 2013.   There are some workaround to get the 3 OSX apps (Pages, Keynote &amp; Numbers) for free without any illegal download.   Does Apple know that or do they do that on purpose ? That a good question that I do not know the answer.  <comment126495> Nice link! You should probably summarize their tutorial here, just in case that page gets taken down sometime in the future.
