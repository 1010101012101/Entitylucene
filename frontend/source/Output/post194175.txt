How do I force Spotlight to index new folders? <body> When I create new folders, Spotlight does not see them. When does Spotlight index new folders? Or better yet, can I force Spotlight to index new folders?   <answer194177> From Apple Support: Spotlight: How to re-index folders or volumes     ol   liFrom the Apple (ï£¿) menu, choose System Preferences./li   liClick Spotlight./li   liClick the Privacy tab./li   liDrag a folder or an entire volume (your hard drive) to the list./li   liIf prompted for confirmation, click OK./li   liRemove the item or volume you just added to the listbr   by clicking it and then clicking the minus ("-") button./li   liClose Spotlight preferences./li   /ol      Spotlight will re-index the contents of the folder or volume.   Note: Dropbox specific information as an addendum to the Apple Support directions.  The above directions are the written ones from Apple Support however with an object like Dropbox on the Sidebar in Finder do not drag and drop it from there, instead either add it to the Privacy tab using the plus ("+") button or drag and drop it from your Home folder.  Then remove it using the minus ("-") button.  If Dropbox was removed from the Sidebar in it can be dragged back from one's Home folder.  <comment231548> If it matters, the new folders are Dropbox folders. <comment231551> Hmm that resulted in a poofy cloud and now i do not see dropbox at all <comment231553> No, it never showed up on the privacy tab. <comment231559> @SoilSciGuy, See the added note to my original answer. <comment231560> See the added note to my original answer. <comment231566> I dragged the DB folder from finder to the privacy tab, which is why it was removed from finder. I should have just used the plus button. Thanks.
