How to know under which account/Apple ID an app was purchased? <body> I uninstalled/removed apps I used to purchase using a family member's Apple ID; then I re-purchased apps using my own Apple ID.   Is there a way for me to check whether the apps are now under my Apple ID? I would like to ensure.  <answer106515> There are 2 ways I can think of now:  ul liFollow this step-by-step program to see your complete purchase history/li liRemove the app, make sure you're logged in on the right account and check if the just removed app has a cloud-symbol instead of "purchase" next to it./li /ul  Hope this helps.  <comment125283> I can see my purchase history in my own Apple ID. And I noticed that some of them got a new update and they are now through my own Apple ID. I didn't see the cloud symbol too.  Thank you very much for your help!
