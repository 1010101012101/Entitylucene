Quick entry for Google Translate via MacOS? <body> Is there a way to input text into a quick-entry form that takes that text to Google Translate, and then spit out a translation? You know how to-do list managers like OmniFocus and Things you can quickly add a to-do or when you press cmd-space for Spotlight Search? I have a feeling it would be through Automator, and saw the following question   Automator Service with Google Translate  but its all greek to me! How would the UI look like?   <answer272998> There are dashboard widgets that offer translation. https://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/travel/languagetranslator.html Then I use a hot corner to quickly launch dashboard. It can also be done by a keyboard shortcut. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7e14c.png" alt="enter image description here"
