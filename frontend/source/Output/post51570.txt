Which iPad/OS X apps can be used to create music for a game? <body> Surprisingly many music applications are being available for iOS and (maybe) OS X. Are there ones that can be in fact used for game creation? I'm looking to create in-background music, and maybe special effect sounds.  <answer51582> Apple's very own GarageBand is a good choice.  <comment58984> Are there any features such a software would need to have which are special to in-game music? <comment59033> @patrix: apps that build track from highly predefined samples, I guess they are often called with "DJ" prefix in name.
