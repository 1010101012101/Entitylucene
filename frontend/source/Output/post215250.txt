Share wifi connection from macbook to airport express <body> I'm trying to do the following setup:  strongInternet modem/router/strong - (wifi)  - strongMacbook/strong - (ethernet) - strongAirport express/strong -(wifi) -  strongvarious devices/strong.  Is it possible to share internet from a MB to an airport express through ethernet?  My MB is a MacbookPro retina from Mid 2012  As to why i'm doing this: I don't have access to the internet modem ( can't plug anything to it), so i'm trying to spread wifi to the rest of my apartment any ways I can. Any other ideas are welcome  <answer215327> ol liGo to strongSystem Preferences - Sharing/strong./li liEnable strongInternet Sharing/strong./li liSet strongShare your connection from/strong to emWi-Fi/em/li liset the strongTo Computers using/strong to  emEthernet/em./li listrongConnect/strong the ethernet cable from Macbook to your airport's strongEthernet WAN port/strong (Dotted circle)./li liThat's it./li /ol  <comment260086> Please add the name/type of the "Internet modem". I've never heard of a Cable/DSL modem providing Wi-Fi **without** being also a router. <comment260132> It's a Neufbox nb6 spec here : http://assistance.sfr.fr/runtime/internet-et-box/box-nb6/box-nb6-adsl-caracteristiques.html <comment260133> Thank whomsoever I've learned french at school ;-) <comment260134> I was plugging the ethernet in the wrong port on the Airport Express. Now i see the AE in the airport utility. Looks like internet sharing is not working i'll look into that.
