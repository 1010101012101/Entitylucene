Any way to "close" a group of reminders all at once on OSX? <body> Every time I turn on my mac, a set of like 10 recurring reminder popups clog up my OSX Desktop screen.  I may be a procrastinator and all, but Reminders.app's interface on OSX feels downright buggy without a button to close all reminders at once, or at least all recurring reminders.  Is there a keyboard shortcut or something to make them all "close" at once? A "Saturday shortcut", lets call it.  <answer290980> There are two fairly easy ways to do this:  h2Option 1 (default):/h2  With the default configuration of your mac, you can simply kbdoption/kbd + click the notification center icon in the top right corner of your screen. This will enable Do Not Disturb, which automatically dismisses all notifications and silences incoming notifications. If you wish to continue receiving notifications, you can kbdoption/kbd + click the notification center icon again. Your notifications that were on the screen will not re-appear.  h2Option 2 (creating a keyboard shortcut):/h2  ol liOpen strongSystem Preferences  Keyboard  Shortcuts  Mission Control/strong/li liEnable the checkbox next to strongTurn Do Not Disturb On/Off/strong/li liClick codenone/code to the right of the option/li liSet a shortcut./li /ol  img src="https://cdn.igeeksblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Custom-Command-to-Turn-On-and-Off-Do-Not-Disturb-on-Mac.jpg" alt="syspreferences screenshot" supCredit: igeeksblog.com/sup  Whenever you want to dismiss all notifications, press this shortcut twice.  <comment367420> I don't suppose you know if it's possible to close all reminders on an iPhone? <comment367512> I was thinking about asking that question also but didn't think it was even possible. I think a shake gesture would be a good way to snooze all your reminders <comment367742> @Little.Eden swipe down from the top to bring down the notifications, there are big (X) buttons - those will mass-delete notifications, but you may need to hit it once for each day.
