Macbook Pro starts with gray screen <body> When I'm closing the screen on my macbook and tries to start it up a few hours later it always starts with a gray screen. It take about 30 to 60 seconds until I can start using the computer.  The macbook is brand new. It doesn't matter if the charger is connected or not.  Anyone knows what the problem could be?  <answer84072> This sounds like an SMC issue to me. SMC is the System Management Controller chip that controls power-centric pieces of the Mac's hardware, such as power, sleep functions, fans, etc. The exact process varies by model of Intel Mac, so I've included the link below.

The idea is to make the answer stand alone. <comment97106> I tried to reset the SMC. Did not work :/
