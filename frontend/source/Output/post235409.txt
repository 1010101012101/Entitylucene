Lost Numbers, Pages, GarageBand, ... after fresh OSX install <body> For the history of my computer, I currently live in China and I bought my early 2015 MBP in Hong-Kong.  There are two methods that I know of to clean install an OSX.  First, through recovery by restarting the computer and holding command+R down until the recovery screen appears. Then the option displayed is download and install OSX from Apple. I tried that first but I guess being in China it displayed more than 50 hours and counting! You can imagine why I had to cancel it. However, with this solution you supposedly get your Mac restored as it was when you purchased it, right? That's what I was looking for.  The second solution is to create a bootable USB drive with OSX on it. It did the job, I was happy until I realized that Numbers, Pages, GarageBand and certainly others I still didn't noticed were missing!  While finding a solution I stumbled upon a forum where a guy had the same problem. His solution was simply to go to the App Store, log in with the original Apple ID and download them all back. Problem, there are not free anymore. The possible workaround this guy found was to click on Buy and Apple Store would recognize him and let him download for free, since it was already purchased in the first place. I tried that but when I created my account I selected "None" for payment method.  If I select a payment method and enter my Mastercard number, will they charge me?  <comment287923> Can you just login to App Store and see those apps under Purchase tab ? <comment287939> Oddly no I don't see them. And I'm using the exact same Apple ID. <comment287956> Can you see if there is a new folder inside your applications folder, named "incompatible" or similar? <comment288230> @Linus: no I don't. I'll just have to go to a physical Apple Store to get it sorted. Otherwise I dont see any way out. Last resort I will reinstall my last backup before the clean install.
