Where can I purchase a replacement screw for my MacBook Pro SuperDrive? <body> While replacing the logic board on my MacBook Pro (15" 2.4 GHz) and I stripped one of the 3.3mm 00 Phillips screws for the SuperDrive.  I have found only one source online that had replacements in stock (http://www.impactcomputers.com/), and they wanted to charge me $19.99 + shipping for 5 of them.  Are stores like this my only recourse, or does anyone know of a better online distributer of Mac parts?  I have checked ifixit.com and I would like to avoid buying full $60 sets for one replacement.  <answer41491> Have you tried ebay? ebay search for "macbook pro screws"  <answer41508> Have you got any old dead computers, or know someone who does? They provide a cheap and ready source of ridiculously expensive to replace parts, including such things as small metric screws.   <answer41518> iFixit is a good place for parts. They seem to sell complete screw kits for different models.   Although one screw missing wonâ€™t hurt the unit. I repaired a machine recently that is literally held together with celo tape and stickers.   <answer41546> You might want to try Other World Computing. They sell Mac parts and kits so they might be able to help you. I have used them in the past and they so far no complaints.   <comment47078> Go to the apple store. If it's just 1 screw and your fairly polite, they'll get it to you from their back room just to get you out of the already crowded store :P <comment47208> Yes bet he wants to avoid spending $60 for a single screw, as mentioned in the question. <comment55854> I was only able to locate full screw sets, so that was no dice.  Thanks tho! <comment55855> A great idea!  But sadly I couldn't find anyone with this model, I ended up just leaving the screw out...no harm it seems :)
