How to install 'MySQL Utilities' using brew or brew cask? <body> I installed MySQL server and client using codebrew/code. I installed MySQL Workbench with codebrew cask/code, but I don't find MySQL Utilities (something new?).  How to install that using codebrew/code or codebrew cask/code?  <answer136180> This will do it:  precodebrew tap caskroom/cask brew install brew-cask brew cask install mysqlworkbench /code/pre  <answer225708> mysql-utils is a different cask  precodebrew cask install mysql-utilities /code/pre  if you do a codebrew search mysql/code you can see the caskroom casks  precode$ brew search mysql automysqlbackup mysql âœ” mysql++ mysql-cluster mysql-connector-c mysql-connector-c++ mysql-sandbox mysql-search-replace mysqltuner               homebrew/php/php53-mysqlnd_ms homebrew/php/php55-mysqlnd_ms homebrew/versions/mysql51 homebrew/versions/mysql56 Caskroom/cask/mysqlworkbench                  homebrew/php/php54-mysqlnd_ms homebrew/php/php56-mysqlnd_ms homebrew/versions/mysql55 Caskroom/cask/mysql-utilities    &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;============= Caskroom/cask/navicat-for-mysql  /code/pre  In order to have a functional mysql-utils you would need to have the python connector. You can download it from   precode http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/python/  (osX 10.8 and 10.9)  or   https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/python/2.0.html (osX 10.7) /code/pre  But I prefer to have from the .tar.gz and install it manually.
