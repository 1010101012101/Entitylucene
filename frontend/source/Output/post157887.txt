Photo with a title and quality? <body> I would like to print high quality photos with the following caracteristics:  ul lilarge size (greater than A3),/li liaccurate tuning of the color options,/li liwith a well presented title,/li likeep a track of the setting used (so as to be able to apply it to many other photos)./li /ul  Something like this theoretical (low quality photo to avoid overloading everyone's connection) example: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MvoK0.png" alt="enter image description here"  I started trying to achieve this task with codeiPhoto/code and codePages/code but the results aren't satisfying in term of time spent to reach such a pretty simple set of functions.  hr  What is the best workflow or method to achive such a simple task?  <comment185757> I hope you're not upscaling from 636x381px, or you've no chance. Photoshop can do that type of task - presumably also the freeware Gimp, though I've never used it myself. http://www.gimp.org <comment185800> Good guess :). This theoretical example is a reduction of 1/15.
