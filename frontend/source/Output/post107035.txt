How to install Octave in OS X 10.9 <body> I had previously used macports to install octave. It was working fine after switching to 10.9, but after the upgrade I tried to add a different package and it did not work. So I foolishly followed the instructions to delete and reinstall everything, and now octave will not reinstall!  I don't care how I get octave on my computer. I just really really need a working copy of it for this weekend. Any suggestions (for a beginner) would be really useful.  <answer108501> Wow I did the same thing... I'd be stoked to see a solution to this.  Have you tried installing codeoctave-devel/code instead?   precodesudo port install octave-devel +atlas+docs+gcc48 /code/pre  Maybe this will work for you..   <answer108603> You might want to try this download from SourceForge:  ul lihttp://sourceforge.net/projects/octave//li /ul  <answer113802> This appears to have been fixed see this bug ticket  Please do:  precodesudo port clean octave sudo port selfupdate /code/pre  and then try installing it again.  <answer161977> You can also use Homebrew for installing octave. I find homebrew more clean and less intrusion than macports as it uses the system libraries available if possible.  Following the instructions on Octave wiki  precodebrew tap homebrew/science brew update &amp;&amp; brew upgrade brew install octave --without-docs /code/pre
