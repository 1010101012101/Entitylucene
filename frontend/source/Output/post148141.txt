The icons do not update in the Finder or Get Info Tab <body> I recently changed my text editor default from 'Text Wrangler' to 'Sublime Text' but even then all the default icons for the files types such as .js and .php still show TextWrangler default icon. When I open the files, It opens in Sublime Text correctly.  What can I do to fix all these default icons?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BazTq.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer148145> You may get some mileage out of the following article:  http://support.apple.com/kb/PH10847?viewlocale=en_US&amp;locale=en_US  In that Info screen, click the Wrangler icon at the top of the page and then kbdcommand/kbd+kbdx/kbd to cut the incorrect icon. That should restore the 'default' image, which is now Sublime Text.  <answer148504> This is for OS X Mavericks.     /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user   Running the above command on Terminal will rebuild the LaunchServices DB, and restarting the Mac works.

It did not work for me <comment174606> The command + x does not cut the icon, although I was able to paste another one but still it only worked for that one file <comment174607> Reboot solves the problem. <comment174721> @fartheraway that solved it <comment174729> damn osx caching functions... <comment248453> Icon and file associations on the mac always drive me crazy. OS X insists on generating the open with menu automatically, but it's always wrong. Showing duplicates, wrong icons, and applications that I do not ever want to use to open that file.
