Can I connect to a specific access point by BSSID? <body> Is there any way to get Mac OS X to connect to a specific access point by BSSID? I have a network with the same SSID for multiple access points, and I would sometimes like to specify which specific access point to connect to. Is this something Mac OS X can do natively, or is there a third party tool that can do this?  <answer8827> What OS X version do you have?  In older versions this is possible:     /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Resources/airport -A'NETWORKNAME' BSSID='00:11:22:33:44:55' password='PASSWORD'   But on OS X 10.6 it doesn't work anymore.  I've searched high and low for a solution for this, but haven't found anything yet. The only solution is going closer to your base station. So that the n -signal is stronger.  <answer217723> You can use that tool:  airport-bssid on github  <comment7371> If the APs are on the same network, you should be connecting automatically to any in range, right? <comment7372> @Nathan Connecting to the network isn't the problem, it's just one is a G network and one is an N network, and I want to use the N one whenever possible. Changing the SSID is, unfortunately, not an option. <comment7373> Gotcha. I was missing the g/n bit. <comment7459> Maybe if you dig into the preferences file and try to edit manually . I know for an old powerbook G4 (Mac 10.4.11) I have the airport command line tool "/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport" with the --associate and --bssid options available but it seems to be removed from newer releases. <comment88690> I have the same issue. I solved it from the other end, blocking my Mac's MAC from the undesirable router. <comment263217> the link doesn't inspire much confidence either <comment311628> @Annhydrium Please add some instructions. Most of the information contained in the README file on that GitHub project is in Japanese. <comment329223> Try google translate.
