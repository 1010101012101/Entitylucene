Mac Mail automatically moving mail to Trash after 48 hours <body> My daughter is using Mac Mail on a new MacBook Air running Sierra. Her ISP is BT (British Telecom). Initially this was running fine, but just recently perfectly good and normal mail that she wishes to keep is being automatically moved from her Inbox to Trash (not Junk) after about 48hr.   I have talked her through all the settings in Preferences over the phone and cannot see any setting that could have caused this. Anyone any suggestions?  <comment340751> Are you sure it's Mac Mail that's moving the email and not the email provider (Yahoo, Hotmail, gMail, etc.). <comment340753> I can't be sure. As BT used Yahoo Mail, goodness knows. The only options seemed to be leaving on the server or not. <comment340754> Is it an option for her to disconnect the BT account and not use Mac Mail for a few days and go directly to the BT email site to read/send?  If after using the BT site only for 3-4 days you still see email being sent to trash, then at least you know where the problem lies. <comment340764> @fsb â€” It would be an option for me, but probably easier for her to take a trip to an Apple Store. Thanks anyway.
