Sublime Text 2 in OSX: all fonts are bold regardless of theme or font <body> I have a weird problem on mac (OSX 10.7): any theme or font I choose - all fonts appear in bold. I sync all settings with Dropbox and on Windows 7 and Ubuntu the fonts are normal.  Don't know if it's an OSX problem or sublime, but did anyone run into this issue?  <answer77554> I haven't expereinced this issue but it looks like in your sublime preferences you can define font options in which you can say codeno_bold/code  precode{     // Valid options are "no_bold", "no_italic", "no_antialias", "gray_antialias",     // "subpixel_antialias" and "no_round" (OS X only)     "font_options": ["no_bold"] } /code/pre  From StackOverflow  <answer151687> Uncheck "Use LCD font smoothing when available" in System Preferences  General then restart Sublime Text.  <answer192222> on retina screen, i was used code"font_options": ["gray_antialias"]/code and got perfect result  <comment89876> I already use `no bold`
