USB modem no longer works after upgrading to El Capitan <body> I have a USB dongle model ZTE AC2792, which I got from my ISP (MTS India). I was using this since last 2 years on different OS X versions and never faced any issue. However recently when I upgraded to 10.11, it stopped working. I tried re-installing the device driver and got message saying its not compatible.   I tried searching for drivers for latest OS X, but I couldn't find even the product listed on ZTE website. ISP support team doesn't know anything about OS X. So no support at that end as well.   Is there any way to get USB modem listed as network interface in El Capitan, then I will be able to use OS X's PPP connection wizard to configure dialup. I don't need ZTE / MTS's interface to connect. Just need OS X to identify the USB modem.   Any help appreciated.   <comment274816> Just asking @devilzk83 , did you check if the dongle is working on Windows OS ? <comment275249> Yes @leovarmak, it works fine in Windows OS as well OS X 10.9, 10.10. Only OS X 10.11 is where its not working.
