How to capture screen on iOS 10 by using AssistiveTouch? <body> As my iPhone Home Button was broken, I use AssistiveTouch to help me to operate the phone.  But when I upgrade to iOS 10, I try to capture screen by using AssistiveTouch Home Button + power button, I cannot get the screen correctly as the AssistiveTouch menu is still on the screen.  Any work around? Thanks.  <answer252596> In the assistive touch menu you've to select: device - more - screenshot.
