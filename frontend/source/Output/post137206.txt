Window corners don't render properly <body> I have recently noticed that some of my windows have weird looking corners. It's like they are missing dark pixels right on the edge.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VbWyx.png" alt="weird corners"  It doesn't always happen, some windows seem to be 'immune' - one example would be Messages, which is the window in the middle.  I'm running OS X 10.9.3.  <answer137356> After the OS X Mavericks v10.9.4 Update, window corners have returned to their previous glory. Update notes don't mention any issue of this kind, so I guess it might have been fixed as a side effect of running the system updater.  EDIT: Aaand the corners are ugly again. It's really weird.  <answer138590> I'm not 100% sure, but it seems to be caused by Firefox. If Finder and Terminal are the first windows to be opened after booting the system, they look fine. If I begin by starting Firefox instead, windows opened afterwards become corrupted.  <comment163002> Do other users on the same computer have the same issue? (I can't reproduce this behaviour on my machine.) <comment163006> I'm the only user on this computer, but I've just tried enabling the guest account, and it still looks this way when I'm logged in as a guest. <comment163039> Is this a MBP? If so, is it a Retina display MBP?   Judging by the picture in the OP, it seems that it only happens when multiple windows are open at the same time, is this an accurate assumption? <comment163040> Nope, it's Air (13-inch, Early 2014). <comment163043> @smadeja I'm not familiar with that model's internal specs. Do you mind providing us with the specs - especially the graphics information? <comment163045> Sure. It's a 1.4 Ghz Intel Core i5 with HD Graphics 5000. The problem seems inconsistent, at the moment all inactive windows look fine.
