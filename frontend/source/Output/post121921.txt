Mavericks Open Directory Setup <body> I am trying to setup the Open Directory server and it keeps failing stating that       precode/etc/openldap/slapd_macosxserver.conf: line 229: invalid path: No such file or directory /code/pre  This is on a newly installed server. Was there something else besides running through the wizard that I was supposed to do?  <answer121924> The missing folder that the error is referring to is code/var/db/openldap/openldap-data/code. This database directory must exist prior to running slapd. Try creating the folder if it doesn't exist and make sure that the folder is read/write by the system.
