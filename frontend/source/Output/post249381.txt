How do I remove an app folder is OSX when all else fails? <body> I have a folder/package in the Applications called CrashPlan.app. The uninstall failed and I am left with a folder that has a Contents folder, but aside from that, is completely empty.  The folder info:   precodedrwxrwxr-x@ 3 root 102 13 Jul 20:36 CrashPlan.app /code/pre  I have tried the following:   precodesudo rm -rf CrashPlah.app chown chflags nouchg /code/pre  I tried the same things in Safe Mode and Recovery Mode. I tried disabling System Integrity Protection. Whenever I try to remove the folder I get: rm: CrashPlan.app/Contents: Operation not permitted rm: CrashPlan.app: Operation not permitted  Does anyone have any advise? I feel like I've tried everything.  <answer249382> I jumped a gun posting here and got the answer elsewhere.  Here is the solution: Because uninstall has already failed, the problem may be that the "system immutable flag" is set for /Applications/CrashPlan.app or its contents. In Terminal, try   precodels -ldO /Applications/CrashPlan.app  /code/pre  and   precodels -ldO /Applications/CrashPlan.app/Contents /code/pre  The ls command may show something like this:  precodedrwxrwxr-x@  3 root  102  schg   13 Jul 14 20:36 CrashPlan.app /code/pre  If you see the schg flag, run these commands:  precodesudo chflags -R noschg /Applications/CrashPlan.app sudo rm -fR /Applications/CrashPlan.app /code/pre  <comment309313> Crash plan has an uninstaller on the dmg you download use that
