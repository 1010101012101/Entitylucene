My iphone 4 needs a software update but none show up? <body> My Iphone 4 needs a software update when I try to download an app but when I go to settings it says there are none. How do I fix this?  <answer248924> The last version of iOS that the iPhone 4 supports is iOS 7.1.2. You will not find any more software updates for the iPhone 4 beyond this and you are unable to install any apps that require a more recent version of iOS.  <comment308606> Your only chance is if there is an older version of the app that will run on iOS 7.1.2, which is the last iOS available for iPhone 4.
