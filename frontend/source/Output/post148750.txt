Best way to recover/restore Time Machine Backup to a second HD? <body> My Macbook HD got corrupted and it couldn't be repaired. Being a 2011 Macbook model, I decided to buy a SSD to be the primary HD and a second 1TB to be used instead of cdrom (using a kit from maxupgrades).  So far, so good. Problem is: now I want to recover/restore a Time Machine backup to this new 1TB hard disk (that isn't the primary one). Which is the best way to avoid data loss in the process? Can I just copy the files from /Backups.backupdb/Latest?
