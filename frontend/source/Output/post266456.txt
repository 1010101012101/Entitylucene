Mac Fuse doesn't work <body> I have installed macfuse and fuse-ext2 multiple times and yet they don't seem to work. I want to be able to mount and edit a Raspberry Pi image file (NTFS) on an SD card. Unfortunately nothing appears of the image file in Finder. What am I doing wrong? One more thing: there's a file that should be edited to be able to write files on the target image. Every tutotiral mentions it yet it cannot be found :  System/Library/Filesystems/fuse-ext2.fs/fuse-ext2.util  Any ideas what I'm doing wrong?  <answer266503> What version of MacFUSE have you installed? MacFUSE is no longer maintained and has been replaced by Fuse for macOS.   The latest version is 3.5.4 and it's compatible with Mac OS X 10.5 and above and works on both PowerPC and Intel Macs.  If you require MacFUSE for your system, then there is a MacFuse google group that may be helpful, although I'm not sure how current it is since the onset of Fuse for macOS.  <comment334113> Can you add a link to the tutorial you've been following? Also which version of the operating system do you have on your Mac?
