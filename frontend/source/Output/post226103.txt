Temporary Folder Path for Apple Script <body> precodeset targetFile to (path to temporary items as string) &amp; fileName /code/pre  I am trying to download a web image to temporary folder by curl in a Apple Script.  According to the above code, the curl downloads it as correct but the targetFile is currently as:  precodeMacintosh HD:private:var:folders:...TemporaryItems:image.png /code/pre  But after download, I need the downloaded image path as a correct file path like:  precode/tmp/image.png /code/pre  How can I set codetargetFile/code as a string that have slash containing file path? Or how can I get the file path of the image after it is downloaded by curl?  <answer226113> You can work around this with something like  precodeset a to "/tmp/" &amp; fileName set targetFile to POSIX path of a --since you are using curl do shell script "curl http://example.com/images.jpg &gt; " &amp; targetFile /code/pre  This AppleScript will make a string containing code/tmp//code, and strongtargetFile/strong sets it to interpret as POSIX (used by shell and curl). Then it downloads strongimages.jpeg/strong and stores it as fileName
