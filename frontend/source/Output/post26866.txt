Is it possible to push the dismiss of a notification to MobileMe in iCal? <body> I have multiple devices set with the same MobileMe account. When I set up an alarm for an event, I get an alert box at right time on the computer I use at that moment. Right. But if I dismiss it on this computer (at work for instance), I will still be notified for the same event when I open my other computer as I get back home.  Is it possible to make something to have this notification only once and that the fact that I've read it is pushed back to my mobileMe account ?
