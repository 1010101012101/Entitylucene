How do I get a folder tree view in the left column of the Finder? <body> I'd like to have a tree view of my current folder (it's children and it's parents) for navigation in the left column of the finder's UI. How do I get that?  <answer237648> In OS X’s Finder, the key combination kbd⌘/kbd+kbd3/kbd arranges the view in column (tree) fashion.  If you wish to add the folder to the Finder’s strongemsidebar/em/strong, simply drag and drop the folder into it under the “Favorites” designation.   If you wish to make the column view the default view for that folder, use the key combination  kbd⌘/kbd+kbdj/kbd with the desired folder selected and then check the option codealways open [browse] in column view./code  <answer237768> codeFavorites/code in the left hand side is a flat list, but it's a good place to store some frequent destinations.  And make sure to select the third option (circled) so you can have a tree structure in your Finder.  Last but not least, you may notice that the screenshot has a codePath Bar/code at the bottom indicating your current location in the hierarchy. And I think this is the closest thing if you are asking for a Windows Explorer type layout. Enable it in the Finder menu: View-Show Path Bar  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/W9VdB.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment291149> This site works better with one question per question. I've removed the second question from your post, please ask it separately if necessary. <comment291227> @patrix, I'm curious, does it actually say anywhere in the rules only "one question per question"? <comment291231> @user3439894 http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/222735/can-i-ask-only-one-question-per-post lists some good reasons for this <comment291233> @patrix, Thanks, the accepted answer made good points. <comment291284> It sounds like the user is asking for a Windows Explorer type layout (unless I misunderstood)which that will not do and is not available in the Finder.. There are, however, 3rd party Finder "replacements/enhancements" that might give you the layout you crave. A search on macupdate.com might be a good place to start.
