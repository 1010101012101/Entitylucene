PostgreSQL in OS X Lion <body> There's be mention made of the fact that OS X Lion Server ships with PostgreSQL as it's standard database rather than MySQL.  Can anyone confirm:  ol liIt this specific to server or does OS X Lion "client" ship with it too?   I can see indications in the file system on my Mac that it might be included but don't know whether they're the result of a previous aborted Postgres install I did on my machine pre-Lion or just some form of standardisation of directory structures that stops short of an actual install./li liIs this intended for use as an end user database or is it just supporting functionality within the OS?/li /ol  <answer19211> On OS X Lion "client", here's what you can find:  precodemartin$ find /usr/ -name postgre* /usr//include/postgres_ext.h /usr//include/postgresql /usr//include/postgresql/internal/postgres_fe.h /usr//include/postgresql/server/postgres.h /usr//include/postgresql/server/postgres_ext.h /usr//include/postgresql/server/postgres_fe.h /usr//lib/postgresql /usr//share/devicemgr/backend/vendor/rails/activerecord/lib/active_record/connection_adapters/postgresql_adapter.rb /usr//share/devicemgr/backend/vendor/rails/railties/configs/databases/postgresql.yml /usr//share/devicemgr/webserver/gems/gems/eventmachine-0.12.10/lib/em/protocols/postgres3.rb /usr//share/man/man1/postgres.1.gz /usr//share/postgresql /usr//share/postgresql/postgres.bki /usr//share/postgresql/postgres.description /usr//share/postgresql/postgres.shdescription /usr//share/postgresql/postgresql.conf.sample /code/pre  So no binary or similar on a default install (yet there are c/c++ headers) and rails stuff.  (note I have Xcode 4.1 installed, and this is where all these Header files may have come from).  2) OS X doesn't use a relational database for anything as far as I know. If it's there is to support development or, well, the service itself.  <answer19557> 1) Yes, it's included in Lion's client factory default from my 2011 macbook air. I found it accidentally, codepsql -v/code will gives you postgresql's latest version, which is version 9 at the moment, entering codewhich psql/code will give you it's path which resides in code/usr/bin/psql/code. I found postgresql's default user which is code_postgres/code, simply change the password to your desired password as you will by entering codesudo passwd _postgres/code.  2) Nope, I didn't think it's for end user database. Even though the codepsql/code binary is there, I couldn't found where's the codeinitdb/code to initialize the database. But, I can't confirm whether it's to support lion's internal system or not, maybe someone can confirm this part?  If you need a working postgresql installation, my suggestion would be installing from source, by using the user code_postgres/code.  <answer22230> http://opensource.apple.com/source/PostgreSQL/PostgreSQL-23/  It's used as the datastore for the stuff codeserveradmin(8)/code works on, Server.App and Server Essentials.  But oh yes, you have it on the client, Server.App emactivates/em the stuff, does not eminstall/em it.    <answer38608> Yes, a clean install of Lion 10.7.2 includes Postgres.   I mean client/desktop edition (I've not used the Server edition).  The included documentation suggests Apple bundled version 9.0.4 of Postgres: file:///Library/WebServer/Documents/postgresql/html/index.html  FYI, current versions of Postgres today are 9.0.6 and 9.1.2.  Besides the list of /usr/ items posted by Mart√≠n Marconcini, I also found: /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/PostgreSQLClient.framework  This was after installing lots of stuff including Java and Eclipse, but not yet doing my own install of Postgres.  <answer45091> They seem to have renamed the server to codepostgres_real/code on my non-server version of Lion.  precode $ /usr/bin/postgres_real --version  postgres (PostgreSQL) 9.0.5  $ /usr/bin/psql --version  psql (PostgreSQL) 9.0.5  contains support for command-line editing  $ /code/pre  I haven't found codeinitdb/code or codepg_ctl/code strongyet/strong so far it seems using it in practice still requires a separate userland install.  I just pray that doesn't introduce conflicts and confusion between the two.  <comment21042> "OS X doesn't use a relational database for anything as far as I know". Actually, it makes quite heavy use of SQLite. <comment21051> @Thilo well, but that's a different story, SQLite you know, is far from being a process like PostgreSQL. I believe you know what I mean. OS X doesn't have  SQLite server running for its own usage that you could use and create dbs, and users, and host applications into.
