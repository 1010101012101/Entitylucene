How to break away from LaCie Big Disk Extreme firmware, for its two disks to appear as two instead of one? <body> h1Question/h1  How can I reconfigure a LaCie Big Disk Extreme so that Mountain Lion will see both of its disks?  h2Background/h2  Once, years ago, I accidentally did something bad to a LaCie device. Where normally its two disks appeared to Mac OS X as one larger disk, the accident caused the two smaller disks to appear. At the time, I chose to resolve the issue by reinstalling firmware with a LaCie-provided utility.   Now: I probably need to 'break away' from that RAID-oriented firmware – intentionally, not accidentally.  I don't want to create two emvolumes/em, neither can I place the disks in different enclosures.   I want to work with the two separate emdisks/em with the current enclosure, so that I can experiment with things such as ZFS.   When I last checked, in 2012, LaCie's firmware utility for this class of drive could not run on Lion.   Data in this enclosure is, always will be, disposable.   h3System information for the device/h3  precodeLaCie Big Disk Extreme LUN 0:    Manufacturer:     LaCie Group SA   Model:            0x1   GUID:             0xD04B5A0E058DF1   Maximum Speed:    Up to 800 Mb/sec   Connection Speed: Up to 800 Mb/sec   Sub-units:     LaCie Big Disk Extreme LUN 0 Unit:       Unit Software Version:  0x10483       Unit Spec ID:           0x609E       Firmware Revision:      0x102       Product Revision Level: 912 /code/pre  <comment76778> Would a good keyword for this be **JBOD**? If so, maybe we should move this question to Server Fault or Super User, where that's a recognised tag (respectively: http://serverfault.com/questions/tagged/jbod and http://superuser.com/questions/tagged/jbod). <comment99442> I'm looking for exactly the same, same Lacie, want 2 separate drives. Did you find a solution? <comment99882> @user45635 nothing yet. If I find one I'll add an answer.
