Bootcamp partition disappears after restarting on SSHD <body> I’ve encountered a really strange problem with my Hybrid Hard Drive (Model: ST1000DX001-1CM162). I’ve installed Bootcamp a few times on my iMac late-2009, and every time after a few restarts (prob. 2-3) the partition would just disappear without a sight. Didn’t seem to matter whether Windows 7 or 8. The partition wouldn’t even show up in Disk Utility. Any clues how to troubleshoot this?
