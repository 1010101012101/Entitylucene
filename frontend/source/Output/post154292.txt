iTerm - going one word backwards and forwards <body> Would it be possible to configure iTerm 2 to go backwards and forwards one word through the curent text in the command line using a keyboard shortcut?  <answer154295> codeCtrl-[ b/code jumps back a word. You can also use codeEsc/code instead or codeCtrl-[/code, and codef/code to go forward.  That is codeCtrl/code+code[/code release and then codeb/code orcodef/code. Or codeEsc/code and codeb/code or codef/code.   More information can be found at this other discussion on AskDifferent.  <answer154296> h2To Get Forward (Alt-f), Backward (Alt-b) and Delete (Alt-d) Word/h2  ol liOpen iTerm./li liGo to iTerm  Preferences...

Also you can delete a word backwards using  kbdOption ⌥/kbd + kbd⌫/kbd, delete the whole line using kbdCommand ⌘/kbd + kbd⌫/kbd, and more.  If the preset doesn't appear, reinstall iTerm2. If you installed it using Homebrew+Cask:  precodebrew cask reinstall iterm2 /code/pre  <comment246914> I tried to add an option+right shortcut and got a warning message about a conflict, because I didn't realize that you can configure keys both in Preferences  Keys  Global Shortcut Keys and also Preferences  Profiles  Keys  Profile Shortcut Keys. Configuring it in the default profile worked. <comment338624> On MacOS 10.12, I need to use hex code 0x17 to get delete to beginning of word <comment341962> works like a charm with macOS 10.12 and zsh <comment359803> You saved my life mate <comment361231> best answer ever you have a beer from me :) <comment362356> Consider upvoting jherran's answer. I think I just improved on their answer a little and probably should have suggested an edit instead of creating my own answer. I kind of feel like I stole it. <comment364218> It works for zsh as well!
