SSH (or SFTP) upload files from OSX terminal <body> I'm trying to upload a file through terminal (didnt managed to do it trough transmit.app)  ul liI'm connected to SSH to my server./li liI want to sent a file from my Local desktop to my server./li /ul  That the command I'm trying :   precodescp /Users/username/Desktop/ad-blocker.sh user@IP:/var/packages/DNSServer/target/script/ /code/pre  I always have this error though " No such file or directory "  not a expert of SSH, but if I'm connected to my server to SSH, how would terminal access my local file anyway (/Users/username/Desktop/ad-blocker.sh)  Kind regards.  <answer228370> You have to make sure that the path you are copying to exists.  Before executing your codescp/code command, codessh/code into your remote host, codecd/code to the directory, and issue the codepwd/code command.  That will give you the current working directory.  Copy that to your clipboard.  Exit SSH, then re-issue the codescp/code command with the directory (paste from your clipboard).  <comment278430> Thank, I didn't disconnect from the SSH first, now I have Permission denied, I have to review the server settings. thank you. <comment278431> *now I have Permission denied* your non-root user usually does not have access to files under `/var/`. This is correct. <comment278435> I've never run into that.  Must be a custom setting in sshd....
