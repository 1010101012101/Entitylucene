Recovering a partition on a flash disk <body> The other day my 128gb flash stick refused to be recognised when I plugged it in, giving me a code'failed to initialize'/code error with options to format it or eject. This was particularly frustrating because I always eject it carefully.  I used codeTestDisk/code to get a list of all the partitions it could find on the drive. Finding six of them, I copied the sector starts and lengths and wrote these partitions using codepdisk/code. The immediate result of this was that three codedmg/code disk images are permanently mounted when I insert the flash stick but not the partition I was looking for. Finder shows nothing else resembling an actual writeable drive.  When I ask for a list of partitions using codepdisk/code I get the following:  precodePartition map (with 512 byte blocks) on '/dev/rdisk2'  #:                type name      length   base      ( size )  1: Apple_partition_map Apple         63 @ 1          2:          Apple_Free Extra   73443080 @ 64        ( 35.0G)  3:           Apple_HFS one      7293752 @ 73443144  (  3.5G)  4:          Apple_Free Extra        960 @ 80736896   5:           Apple_HFS two       798128 @ 80737856  (389.7M)  6:          Apple_Free Extra   20619600 @ 81535984  (  9.8G)  7:           Apple_HFS three      25128 @ 102155584 ( 12.3M)  8:          Apple_Free Extra      84696 @ 102180712 ( 41.4M)  9:           Apple_HFS four      110000 @ 102265408 ( 53.7M) 10:          Apple_Free Extra   95297352 @ 102375408 ( 45.4G) 11:           Apple_HFS five     1095936 @ 197672760 (535.1M) 12:          Apple_Free Extra   25165024 @ 198768696 ( 12.0G) 13:           Apple_HFS six     14944120 @ 223933720 (  7.1G) 14:          Apple_Free Extra   22119280 @ 238877840 ( 10.5G)  Device block size=512, Number of Blocks=260997120 (124.5G) DeviceType=0x0, DeviceId=0x0 /code/pre  Now, I'm fairly inexperienced at this but the various codeApple_Free/code sections look unusually large to me. And with their collective size I'm sure the original drive is contained inside these in some shape or form. Is there a way I can convert an codeApple_Free/code section into a regular codeHFS/code partition using codepdisk/code to check or am I going about this completely wrong/liable to lose everything?
