GPU failure. Logic board. Mac Pro Mid 15' 2012 <body> I faced the problem with my mac pro that GPU started to fail. Apple run their diagnosis and confirmed it. So what happened laptop sometimes starting to run after restart all the other time just black screen with sounds and working everything. Apple says that can only replace logic board for $830 CAD and its a lot because they just replaced my screen 3 weeks ago (they saying this problem is not related).   I found this article that this macbooks more likely to have this problem (http://www.macworld.co.uk/news/mac/widespread-2011-macbook-pro-failures-petition-lawsuit-repair-programme-3497935/) and they were fixed for free by this program (http://www.apple.com/uk/support/macbookpro-videoissues/)  However, "The program covers affected MacBook Pro models until December 31, 2016 or four years from its original date of sale, whichever provides longer coverage for you."  Is there anything I can do about it or fix it for free or with some discount? I just got unlucky that this problem didn't happen 4 month ago.
