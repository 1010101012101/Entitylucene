Safari extension alternative for "cliget" or "curlwget" - to get curl/wget command with cookie <body> These two extensions for Firefox and Chrome respectively allow the user to click a link, not download the file, but instead get a wget/curl command with cookie included.  I am looking for the same thing for Safari.  https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cliget/ https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/curlwget/jmocjfidanebdlinpbcdkcmgdifblncg?hl=en
