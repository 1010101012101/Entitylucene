Mounting a remote SCP or SFTP share on Mac <body> I use Fuse4X and ForkLift to mount a remote directory (a dev server). I use PHPStorm to open projects and source (code/Volumes/dev/project_path/code), but sometimes it happens that Forklift freezes (in Activity Monitor 100 and more percent cpu). To solve this I have to kill Forklift, remount and reopen project.  Any idea or tip for better mounting?  <answer55413> This is not selling pitch but I use Flow sftp+ftp application to work on my servers.  <answer55445> Two good options, one paid, one free.  h2Transmit/h2  Transmit is a long-standing and well-regarded Mac app that handles FTP, SFTP, S3 and WebDAV (possibly other protocols, I'm not sure). It can mount anything you can access as a local volume. $34, but it's the faster way, if you don't mind buying another app.  h2FUSE and Macfusion/h2  Download and install FUSE for OS X and Macfusion. Make sure to check MacFUSE compatibility when installing FUSE for OS X. Open up Macfusion, add a new share with the + button, and you should be set. This is the free option, but it can be a bit fiddly, and I've heard it can be less stable, but I don't have enough experience with it to say for sure.  <answer60500> Try CyberDuck for free: http://cyberduck.ch/  And I found SSHFS: http://fuse.sourceforge.net/sshfs.html  <answer72657> Getting OSx for developer -ready, I have heard of the following below.   ul liExpanddrive here/li lisshfs with brew (FREE)/li liCyberduck -- insecure Java -implementation, apparently free version here/li liTransmit here/li /ul  And lastly platform-independent -solution that looks most promising because you can export instances:  ul liOwncloud.com here/li /ul  <answer78999> Best option for me is now strongSamba/strong. After install and adding smb user works perfectly. Simply connect in Finder - Shared - 'server-name'. Bye FUSE and Macfusion!  <answer230473> Seems https://mountainduck.io is where it's at:     Mountain Duck lets you mount server and cloud storage as a local disk in the Finder.app on Mac and the File Explorer on Windows. Open remote files with any application and work like on a local volume.   If you find other alternatives, add them at https://alternativeto.net/software/mountain-duck/  <comment84358> ...instead of wasting time with brew and proper sshfs -installation, you may want to try some of the apps -- I faced this bug with brew [here](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/issues/13647). <comment84359> ..according to feedback, the developer has abandoned this project hence -1. I don't know whether the feedback is correct but not good feedback in the store. <comment84362> ...last commit with Macfusion 3 years ago, first impression not good -- does it work let say for sftp? <comment144051> Transmit doesn't support SCP.  However, http://frank.vanpuffelen.net/2008/01/winscp-replacement-for-mac.html <comment295091> Transmit still does not support SCP. <comment295104> Any server that you can access with SCP should support SFTP, both run over SSH. SCP is non-interactive, so any sort of disk mounting would be a big hack at best.
