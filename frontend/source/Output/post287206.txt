Hotkey: LineIn: Enable/Disable Pass Through Audio <body> h2Intro/h2  I use a pair of in-ear headphones (i.e. spongy-expanding earplugs).br I really like them, but they are a hassle to put in or take out.    This is not an issue when doing uninterrupted work,br but when someone wants my attention while I'm working,br it's easier to just feed in sound through my laptop's internal mic.    I downloaded codeLineIn.app/code, a free application which does (only) this.br It is literally just a window with a button to enable/disablebr the passing of system input to system output.  When enabled, it works great for what I need; however,br I would like to reduce the effort of enabling and disabling it.  h2Question/h2  How do I set the capabilities of codeLineIn/code to hotkeys, such that:  ul liPressing a hotkey enables the feature seamlessly and invisiblybr (and therefore without interrupting whatever I was using or had on screen.)/li liPressing the same hotkey (or different) disables the feature seamlessly and invisiblybr (and therefore without interrupting whatever I was using or had on screen.)/li /ul  (The program does not support hotkeys by default,br nor are its features a system service by default.)  When I say seamless, I mean:  ul liwithout opening new windows (or at least closing them rapidly after)/li liwithout switching applications (or at least switching back rapidly  after)/li liwithout switching spaces (or at least switching back rapidly after)/li /ul  Alternatives are always welcome too; can't have the world. : j  Additional interests would be:  ul liLocking out the hotkey if the built-in speakers are active.  /li liDisabling the passthrough if the audio output device changes.  /li /ul  This is because passthrough is potentially damaging to built-in speakersbr due to feedback from the built-in speakers into built-in microphone.
