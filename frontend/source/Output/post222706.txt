Stream different videos and sounds to Bluetooth headphones & loudspeakers <body> I have Bluetooth headphones &amp; loudspeakers.   I want to stream sound from iTunes to Bluetooth headphones and a YouTube video to the loudspeakers.  I know that OS X allows to stream one source to both devices, but I want to stream each stream to different devices.  I know that in Windows it's possible via Realtek utility, but how about OS X?  <answer222709> OS X itself supports each app using a different device, as long as that app support select a device instead of using the default one. Unfortunately neither iTunes or Safari supports alternative device unless that's an AirPlay device.  You have still two options here:  ol liget an AirPlay enabled device, so you may choose device in iTunes or Youtube Player (which is powered by HTML 5 not Flash)/li liget another music app other than iTunes, I'd recommend Vox for Mac[1] which supports play iTunes Library and a lot more, you may choose device in the app. /li /ol  UPDATE 2016/02/20 AirFoil 5 for Mac[2] now supports set different audio source for different apps.
