Lost installation cd <body> I lost the installation cds from my MBP.  Is that possible get a copy from apple? Or can I use a installation cd from another MBP?  Thanks  <answer61930> Call (or visit) AppleCare (a genius bar) for a replacement disc to be mailed. If another identical model's media is available, that would work, but the restore media are narrowly made to just work for one or a few models in general.
