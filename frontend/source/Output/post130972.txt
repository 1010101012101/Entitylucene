MacBook discharging while plugged in under load <body> I have the latest Retina MacBook Pro codeMacBookPro11,2/code  I quite often have the CPU at about 400%-500% usage (e.g. 4-5 cores at 100%) and also do GPU intensive tasks. While this is happening, the battery can actually emdischarge/em even though it is plugged in. This has happened since I first got the MacBook and is not something which has developed over time.  This is very irritating for me, is this a fault or normal behaviour?  I have the model emwithout/em a dedicated GPU (Intel Iris Pro only), and I have an 85 watt power supply which came with the MacBook  Thanks  <answer142321> It is a known problem: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3069428 Someone has calculated the max wattage draw of a MBPr, but I can't find that a.t.m.  <comment214943> I noticed the same thing ( MBP Mid 2014 i7 ) and for a Â£2000 laptop, it's unacceptable to not be able to use it on 100% for more than a few hours. <comment215180> @AntouanK, I got a new power supply for unrelated reasons, and I've not been able to reproduce the problem since. My old power supply would get extremely hot on the cable, and eventually melted itself, turns out there was extra resistance in the wires for whatever reason. My new 85 watt supply is keeping up with the MacBook load perfectly <comment215192> Easy way: get "bitcoin-qt" and let it run for a few hours. You'll see the charge going down, even though it's plugged in. I have the stock charger that came with MBP. I'll see if I can try with another one. Thanks. <comment215528> Yeah, mine used to do just that under heavy GPU and CPU load. After getting a new (official) power supply, it's not happened again even in the same situations as the last one <comment339031> Same things are happening to my 2011 MBP, and it looks like designed behaviour. If you are curious, you can find your processor's TDP (45W for me) and compare it with charger power.
