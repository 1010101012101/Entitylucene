App store review - can project contain "beta" in its name even if it's not beta? <body> My project contains the word "beta" in name, but has nothing to do with beta. Renaming project is kind of tedious so I wonder if ios app store may reject my app due to that fact? Should I keep trying to rename the project?  What is your opinion?  Thanks in advance  <answer173564> If look at the AppStore you'll find some apps the uses the word beta without being beta-apps.   So if it's clear enough that your app is not a beta app, it should get accepted :)
