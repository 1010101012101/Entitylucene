Admin privileges requiring for installing a package build though Packages <body> Using osx 10.9 and packages for making package installer.  While installing a package made using strongPackages/strong in strong/Applications/strong location on a osx 10.9 machine, installer is asking for strongAdmin password/strong. Even though I had unchecked 'Require admin password for installation' while package making.  So, how to avoid this i.e a non-admin user should install this package. Package should install in /Applications location, so that non-admin user can use the app.  I check this and this  <answer163409> I think somewhere In your package you hav checked require admin authentication. I have tested on 10.9 its not asking for password.  <answer163420> The installer is actually doing the right thing by asking for an admin password. Users without admin rights do not have the ability to write to the strong/Applications/strong directory on a Mac.  Without knowing more about your installer, I suspect the request for an admin password is coming from Apple's strongInstaller.app/strong, which is the application that your installer is working with to install your application.   strongInstaller.app/strong is detecting that the non-admin account that's running the installation doesn't have admin rights and that strong/Applications/strong doesn't allow non-admin users to write to it. To resolve the issue, strongInstaller.app/strong is requesting that an admin account authenticate the installation and authorize the needed rights. Otherwise, the installation will just fail.  <comment190821> If everything You need goes into one bundle inside `/Applications` dir, why don't You pack Your `.app` file inside dmg, so user could just drag and drop Your app? <comment190825> There is a folder myapp which contains a)a.app b)b.app So I made package of this myapp folder which installs in /Application location. So in /Applications location myapp folder installs through myapp.pkg. <comment190828> So are you saying to make dmg of this myapp folder. how please xplain <comment190830> Using `hdiutil` command. Here's more info about this. http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/50040/74657 You can drag'n'drop this folder to `/Applications` without admin password. <comment190833> Here's explanation how You can make custom backgrounds inside `dmg` file: https://el-tramo.be/guides/fancy-dmg/ <comment190842> Thanks @MateuszSzlosek. I created dmg. But when drag and droping the contains dmg i.e. myapp folder, non-admin user requires admin privileges. So again the same issue. <comment190914> In /Applications location, drag and drop also requires admins privileges. So same issue. <comment191434> Which package are you using for installer making. I am using Packages. Application should be install in /Application location. It is asking password for both admin and non-admin users. Also I had not checked the require admin button. <comment191557> I am using Package Maker <comment191585> Are you installing package in /Applications location. <comment191595> Yes , i am installing package inside Applications
