mac goes for sleep on screen lock <body> On screen lock mac goes to sleep impacting the downloads &amp; etc.  Is there any way I can lock the screen with password protection and not loose the connections ?  OS version: EL Captain  Currently img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OIqRT.png" alt="power saver option"  <answer261132> Have you tried the following:  ul liGo to System Preferences  Energy Saver /li liSet computer sleep to Never (or an appropriately long period of time)/li liSet display sleep to occur when you like/li liNow go to System Preferences  Security &amp; Privacy/li liClick on General/li liTick the box for emRequire password...after sleep or screen saver begins/em/li liClick on the drop-down menu to select how long after sleep you want the need for a password to be activated (Immediately, 5 secs, 1 min, etc etc)/li liExit System Preferences/li /ul  Note, if you want you can also use the Screen Saver function to achieve the same thing. You would still do the above steps, but in addition:  ul liGo to System Preferences  Desktop &amp; Screen Saver/li liSelect the Screen Saver tab/li liSet the Start After option (at bottom left) to dictate when you want the Screen Saver to start - note you may want this to be set at a shorter period than your Energy Saver sleep settings (e.g. If you set your display sleep to occur after 15 mins, you may want your screen saver to start after 5 mins - this means your screen saver will be active for 10 minutes before your display will fully go to sleep)/li liChoose any other Screen Saver options you like/li liExit System Preferences/li /ul  If you have any problems/questions, let me know.
