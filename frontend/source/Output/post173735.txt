Display Port to Thunderbolt Display <body> I have a graphics card that has a standard sized display port(DP). If I purchase a male-to-male display port to mini-display port, will I be able to connect my 27" Thunderbolt display to my PC?  <answer173738> Short answer - No.  You can go from Thunderbolt to DisplayPort, but not the other way round.  You can connect DisplayPort devices to a Thunderbolt port, but you can't connect a Thunderbolt device to DisplayPort.  <comment204428> So there is no way to connect a Thunderbolt display to a PC? <comment204429> I can't find a single reference to being able to - yet lots that say you can't. Of course, there's one sure way to find out - try it & see.
