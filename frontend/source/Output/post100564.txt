Is there a keyboard shortcut that I could use to set a task priority in Reminders.app on a Mac? <body> I know that if I want to create a new task in Reminders and I write something like:     emBuy milk tomorrow at 3:00pm/em   Reminder.app understands by itself that the date and the time of execution of the task will be tomorrow at 3:00pm and it will set both of them for me. So I don't need to select the task, push the "i" button, check the option "Remind me on a day" and set a time and a date.  My question is quite simple, and is this:  strongIs it possible to do the same for priorities ?/strong  I mean: I'd like to write something like:     emBuy milk !!/em   and see the app that understands that the two exclamation points on the task mean that it has an higher priority. I tried to use different sentences and AFAIK there's no way of telling Reminders to set the priority for me, without having to manually set it. That would be super-handy for me. But I might be wrong, and this is why I'm asking you if there's any way to avoid having to go in the options of each task and set the priority.  Thank you and best regards  <answer100582> By default there is no way to set the priority of a reminder within the text.  There is a least one third-party app that was designed to do this, called (appropriately enough) AddToReminders, though it seems to have been abandoned, and you would need to compile the app yourself using Xcode.  <answer100587> I'd recommend using Keyboard Maestro for just such an operation. This is perfect for a KM macro.   EDIT: I tested the following and it works well.  Create the following AppleScript:  precodetell application "System Events"     display dialog "New Reminderâ€¦" default answer ""     set reminTitle to text returned of result     set thePriority to 13     set lastChars to reverse of characters -3 through -1 of reminTitle     log lastChars     set i to 0     set j to 0     repeat 3 times         set i to i + 1         if item i of lastChars is "!" then             set thePriority to thePriority - 4             set j to j + 1         end if     end repeat     set reminTitle to text 1 through (-(j + 1)) of reminTitle     if text -1 through -1 of reminTitle is " " then         set reminTitle to text 1 through -2 of reminTitle     end if     tell application "Reminders"         set newremin to make new reminder         set name of newremin to reminTitle         set priority of newremin to thePriority     end tell end tell /code/pre  Then assign the AppleScript to a Keyboard Maestro shortcut.  When you run the macro, you will be prompted to enter the reminder. Use one exclamation point to set "Low" priority in Reminders, use two to set "Medium", and three for "High". Using no exclamation points will set to priority "None". Note that using this does eliminate Reminders' ability to parse due dates.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WbXNJ.png" alt="High Priority example"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rY0C3.png" alt="Medium Priority example"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1PNft.png" alt="Low Priority example"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nfHZn.png" alt="No Priority example"  The resulting entries into Reminders.app will be...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yaHXq.png" alt="Reminders entries"  <comment118345> :-( I hoped I didn't tried the right way but now I understand there's no way of getting it done. Thank you very much for the answer. <comment118373> Can you use KM for this though? It requires clicking in a specific place then another click in the resulting...popover I guess you'd call it? Anyway it does not appear anywhere in the menus, only in non-standard UI. <comment118383> tubedogg, see edits in original answer. <comment118386> I added some code to look for !! at the end of the reminder string, and parse it appropriately. The only other concern I have is Reminders no longer parses for due dates, but that is somewhat beyond the scope of AppleScript to handle.
