Best Torrent Client that supports auto unrar <body> I used to be a PC boy and now been in to Macs for a few years. I am after a good torrent client that supports auto unrar and move on completion.  Anybody know of anything like this? Google doesn't seem to turn up much.  Thanks  Lee  <answer20864> Transmission is generally regarded as the best BT on the Mac, and can definitely do move on completion. That's found in the Transfers - Adding tab in Preferences.  It doesn't have auto unrar built in, but it can run a script on torrent completion.  There are several available scripts on the Transmission forums. Torrentexpander claims to work well on OS X and is written for Transmission.  As far as I can tell, the steps to using it are:  ol liUnzipping it and putting the torrentexpander.sh file into a suitable folder./li liIn Transmission, open Preferences, and click on the Transfers tab./li liIn the Management sub-tab, tick Call script when download completes, and then point it to the torrent expander.sh file./li /ol  In theory, it should then Just Work. I've not tested it, but it's all free and worth a shot. Post back if you're successful!
