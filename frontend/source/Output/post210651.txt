Simple Console Editor for OS X Terminal <body> I am looking for a simple console text editor for OS X to run in a terminal. I have used “Joe” for many years, and it’s very good, but I am looking for one that is simpler.  In particular I would prefer one that uses copy &amp; paste like modern text editors, and allows you to select text with the shift-arrow keys.  Windows has the built-in editor called “Edit”. Something like that would be nice.  <answer210654> There are a bunch of editors running in Terminal already installed by default. Some of them come with quite a learning curve though...  ul licodenano/code rather easy to use, onscreen help, limited functionality/li licodeemacs/code takes some time to get used to, start with the tutorial (type kbdCtrl-h t/kbd)/li licodevi/code/codevim/code takes some time to get used to as well, especially because it's a modal editor, start with the help document (type kbd:help/kbd)/li /ul  And of course there is also codeTextedit.app/code. Doesn't run in Terminal but is quite a versatile editor to get started.  <comment254230> What do you mean by "console editor"? If you mean an editor that runs in a terminal window, you can always use Emacs. The one bundled with OS X is old but still usable, you can download a newer version from "emacsforosx.com". (However, Emcas might not land in the "simple" section, though.) <comment254231> @Lindydancer I’ve edit the question accordingly. It’s to run in a termminal. <comment254233> See also http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/53444/built-in-text-editor-in-terminal , http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/97595/simple-text-editor-that-supports-highlighting-and-font-colours and a lot more via [search](http://apple.stackexchange.com/search?q=editor+osx). <comment254238> The requirement to run in Terminal pretty much excludes any modern conventions like selecting with the shift-arrow keys or interacting with the system clipboard.
