Where does iPhone save temp files? <body> I was doing a very important recording on the soundcloud iPhone app and it ran out of battery. When I charged it up soundcloud app doesn't have the recording anywhere. On the iPhone filesystem where is the file likely stored?  <answer54695> Probably code&lt;Application_Home&gt;/tmp//code see Apple's File System Programming Guide however you would need to ask soundcloud's authors for the exact details.
