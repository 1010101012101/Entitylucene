Google Chrome on OSX - disable password autofill <body> How can I disable password autofill/autosave in Google Chrome without deleting all my passwords from the Keychain? I tried just disabling autofill, but Chrome keeps filling out passwords and still conflicts with LastPass.  I want to keep the passwords in the Keychain to use them on my iPhone/iPad with iCloud Keychain, but in Chrome I only want to use LastPass. Using Lastpass and Chrome autofill together does not really work properly, since they seem to conflict. I have to try multiple times to fill out login data etc.  Any help is much appreciated. Or should I file a bugreport with Chrome?  <answer122344> In Chrome, open the Preferences  scroll down and use Advanced  Find Passwords and Forms and un-check it.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AHxbg.png" alt="enter image description here"  To prevent Chrome using already stored passwords remove it in keyhain.  You have to do that for every Chrome password saved in keychain :(  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bkpRg.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer153220> Open Safari. Click Preferences on the top left next to the Apple logo. A box appears. You can now see Autofill on top. Click Autofill. Now select or unselect as per your requirements.   <answer206791> In a similar vein to Buscar's solution. A way of getting chrome to forget already entered passwords and usernames is to clear browser history. Chrome - Clear Browsing Data - Make sure the passwords checkbox is selected and that "Obliterate the following items from:" is set sufficiently far back.   <answer283381> This is working with my Google Chrome.   Just go into History in Chrome or Press kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdH/kbd and clear your history. Obliterate the following items from the beginning of time. Then uncheck the password check button and hit clear browsing data.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GOksy.png" alt="Please Check this "  <comment142757> file a bugreport anyway, Chrome needs some major overhaul. <comment142760> As I said, this does not prevent chrome from filling out previously saved passwords (at least for me). Did you try it? <comment142762> Maybe I did not understand your question? you want to keep the Chrome passwords in keychain but you do not want Chrome to use them? <comment142763> Exactly, but Chrome seems to use it anyway even if Autofill is disabled. <comment142764> see my update :) <comment142767> Thanks, I will upvote your answer but this is not a solution for me - I have more than 1,000 passwords saved and will certainly not go through them one-by-one. I filed a bug report with Chromium: https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=347083&thanks=347083&ts=1393410783 <comment142768> Filed a bugreport: https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=347083&thanks=347083&ts=1393410783 <comment142771> Thanks, while waiting are you interested in Apple script to do that for you (disable Google Chrome access to keychain)? We would have to find one first, or ask a new question here. <comment142785> It would be great to have an Apple script to toggle Chrome access to the keychain passwords. I will take a look. <comment180396> Thanks for taking the time to answer. But this is how to deal with password autofill in Safari; tholu was asking about Chrome.
