How do I get rid of this:(-bash: cd: /Users/Dakota/Documents/School/Spring: No such file or directory) from my terminal? <body> Every time I open Terminal this is on there like 50 times.  precode-bash: cd: /Users/Dakota/Documents/School/Spring: No such file or directory -bash: cd: /Users/Dakota/Documents/School/Spring: No such file or directory -bash: cd: /Users/Dakota/Documents/School/Spring: No such file or directory -bash: cd: /Users/Dakota/Documents/School/Spring: No such file or directory -bash: cd: /Users/Dakota/Documents/School/Spring: No such file or directory -bash: cd: /Users/Dakota/Documents/School/Spring: No such file or directory /code/pre  I have no idea what I'm doing, I was just trying to get my Terminal to start with a folder and I found this online:  precodeecho "cd "`pwd` &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile  /code/pre  I used that when I was in the folder I wanted to start with on Terminal and it didn't work so being dumb I did it like 50 times so my Terminal always starts with a bunch of code-bash: cd: /Users/Dakota/Documents/School/Spring: No such file or directory./code It's ugly and I need it gone.  <answer278753> First we'll look at what the command did. The codeecho/code part returned the value of the arguments to the standard output. In this case, it wrote codecd/code plus the response of the command codepwd/code which returns the current directory. The code&gt;&gt;/code part of the command writes the output of the command before it (in this case, the result of codeecho/code) to a file. The file it wrote to was ~/.bash_profile, which is a file of commands to run when bash is invoked. In this case, when you start your terminal.  To fix it, you can simply remove the lines that the command added. To do so, you can use Nano, which comes with your computer. Run codenano ~/.bash_profile/code in terminal, and then remove the lines that say codecd /Users/Dakota/Documents/School/Spring/code. Save your changes by pressing codectrl + x/code, and then press enter. Now, when you open a terminal window, you shouldn't be seeing those lines of text :)  <comment350836> Never copy a command into your terminal if you don't know what it's doing. In this case, you are appending `cd wherever_you_are` to the end of your bash_profile, which controls your bash settings. Fix it easily with `sudo nano ~/.bash_profile` and delete that line and save. If you wanna make a folder by terminal use `mkdir myfolder` <comment350840> @Scipt Kitty No need to use `sudo` .
