Slow login and Terminal loading time in Yosemite, possibly related to open directory <body> I have a problem with slow login times in Yosemite.  Logging in is speedy after booting, but after a while (a few days usually) it slows down and can take 20-30 seconds.  The time to load a new Terminal window / tab also increases.  If I reboot, the problem is fixed...for a while.  I tried the answers in this question and nothing seemed to work.  I ran the profiling suggested here and this part of the output looks suspicious:  precode+   ! 8118 ???  (in login)  load address 0x10583c000 + 0x2a8f  [0x10583ea8f] +   !   8118 openpam_dispatch  (in libpam.2.dylib) + 277  [0x7fff86957a7d] +   !     8117 ???  (in &lt;unknown binary&gt;)  [0x1058c4bf2] +   !     : 8117 ???  (in &lt;unknown binary&gt;)  [0x1058c40e9] +   !     :   8117 ODRecordAuthenticationAllowed  (in CFOpenDirectory) + 258  [0x7fff9161df85] +   !     :     8117 transaction_simple  (in CFOpenDirectory) + 448  [0x7fff91615274] +   !     :       8117 _dispatch_semaphore_wait_slow  (in libdispatch.dylib) + 213  [0x7fff955c07f6] +   !     :         8117 semaphore_wait_trap  (in libsystem_kernel.dylib) + 10  [0x7fff882b751a] /code/pre  But further Googling hasn't turned up anything helpful for solving the problem.  Any ideas on how I can further diagnose or fix this issue?
