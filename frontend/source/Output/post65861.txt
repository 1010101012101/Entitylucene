iOS apps cannot be downloaded or updated <body> I tried to update my apps today, and there appeared a notice said that "iTunes terms &amp; conditions have changed. Before you can proceed you must read &amp; accept the new terms &amp; conditions". I selected OK and agreed the terms and conditions. Then there was another notice said 'download now: ***will now begin to download'. I pressed Ok. Then the first notice about the iTunes terms and conditions appeared again. All the process repeated then and it became an endless loop. I cannot download or update apps.   <answer65864> This is a widespread issue affecting many iOS devices (with the exceptions of international stores). sApple has yet to respond/fix this bug./s  strongupdate/strong It appears that Apple has resolved the issue. You can now download iTunes media normally.
