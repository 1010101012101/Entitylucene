How to use plain text smileys (disable automatic emoji substitution) in Messages.app? <body> How to use plain text smileys (disable automatic emoji substitution) in Messages.app? In OS X 10.8 there was a setting for this in the app’s Preferences pane, but in OS X 10.9 that doesn’t seem to be the case anymore.  <answer106254> Run the following command (source) in Terminal:  precodedefaults write com.apple.messageshelper.MessageController SOInputLineSettings -dict-add "automaticEmojiSubstitutionEnablediMessage" -bool false /code/pre  Then restart Messages.app.  <answer108638> Go to the Edit menu, submenu Substitutions, then uncheck Emoji.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cebfY.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment124856> In my opinion, it is not cool to ask and answer your [own questions](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/106058/difference-between-us-qwerty-and-international-qwerty-apple-keyboards) as a way of posting a tip that you have found, but maybe others disagree... <comment124884> @beroe Well, Jeff Atwood disagrees with you. http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/07/its-ok-to-ask-and-answer-your-own-questions/ <comment124887> Interesting. I'll have to ponder that. Thanks for the link. <comment127323> @beroe Also, http://apple.stackexchange.com/help/self-answer <comment127324> But someone else just might come up with an even better answer, as happened here. <comment127349> Nice! I always prefer `dwrites` because I keep a file of them that I use to setup a new system the way I like it, rather than checking 100 different menu items. Verified on 10.9. <comment127351> Yeah, [me too](http://mths.be/osx). But I guess most people prefer a UI for everything, so I ended up accepting the other answer ;) <comment127352> @DanielLawson [Depends on your definition of “better”](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/106254/4408#comment127351_106254), but yeah :) Love when this happens. <comment127363> @MathiasBynens You're absolutely correct.
