How can I disable Bluetooth A2DP profiles on the iPhone 4? <body> Simple question: I'd like to disable the A2DP profile for either (a) specific devices paired with the iPhone or (b) the profile entirely from the phone. How can I disabled the A2DP profiles? There used to be a program called Bluetooth Profile Selector for jailbroken iPhones. However, it stopped working after 4.3.1.  Here's the detailed scenario on why:br I have a stereo in my car that accepts a USB connector. This is how my iPhone is connected and plays music through. This way the audio quality is pristine, I can see the track information and control my iPhone from the headunit, and it charges my iPhone.  The headunit also pairs via Bluetooth for hands-free calling. However, because the iPhone supports A2DP, this is how it pairs to the headunit. I can do hands-free calling just fine, however it screws up the audio coming from the dock connector. Basically, the iPhone will begin playing music via the dock connector until it auto-pairs with the headunit. At this point, the iPhone automatically changes the output method to the Bluetooth connection. Manually changing this back over to the dock connector every single time is not something I wish to deal with.  <answer12851> The app you are referring to has a manual process you can try, but it is not for the faint of heart: http://blog.ramondeklein.nl/?p=257     strongHowto disable A2DP on the iPhone/strong      The interesting directory is   /var/mobile/Library/Preferences, where   the iPhone stores the BlueTooth   settings. These settings are stored in   the PLIST format, so you need a PLIST   editor (Mac or PC) or you need to   convert them by hand. Transfer the   com.apple.MobileBluetooth.services.plist   to your computer or you can use iFile   to edit the file on your iPhone   directly.      Open the   com.apple.MobileBluetooth.services.plist   in your PLIST editor and make sure you   edit the A2DPService section and store   the devices you don’t want to use A2DP   in the UnauthorizeList (without the   letter “d”). This dictionary will   probably not exist yet, so you need to   add it by hand. You need to know the   MAC address, but it is probably listed   already in this file.  precode&lt;key&gt;A2DPService&lt;/key&gt; &lt;dict&gt;   &lt;key&gt;State&lt;/key&gt;   &lt;true/&gt;   &lt;key&gt;UnauthorizeList&lt;/key&gt;   &lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;00:10:60:D0:91:D0&lt;/key&gt;        &lt;!-- This is the MAC address --&gt;     &lt;date&gt;2009-08-08T01:00:00Z&lt;/date&gt;   &lt;!-- Timestamp --&gt;   &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; /code/pre      Transfer the PLIST file back to your iPhone and reboot the device. Once it gets back on,  then the A2DP service should be disabled.   <answer21008> A new package was developed to disable A2DP and I can confirm it works.  http://www.if0rce.com/en/bluetooth-service-manager/  <answer28762> Do you not just need to do this;  ol liConnect via bluettooth/li liGo to the iPod app/li liClick on the hidden button bottom right that only appears when you are connected to Bluetooth./li liSelect the output device that isn't your handsfree destination, it seems to remember this choice on my setup(?)/li /ol  That worked for me when I had the same problem  <answer38357> Another answer mentioning the Bluetooth service manager doesn't work in all cases. Specifically, it only disables A2DP and it doesn't disable it per device.  I use a parrot car kit and would rather use my blackberry Bluetooth dongle I have in the car, unfortunately that little button that appears doesn't remember settings for me, kind of a pain to switch it while driving, it seems to change back to the parrot after a call also.    <comment13874> Thanks for sharing this, however this "manual" process mimics the jailbroken app's behavior and does not work. I am messing with the Bluetooth PLIST's now, so hopefully I'll come up with something on that route. <comment13876> Alright, sorry I couldn't be of more help! <comment43929> I'll add to this request. I have a bluetooth stereo (sony mex-bt3800u) which is great for music and podcasts via bluetooth but hands free is frankly cack. I have a parrot ck3100 also and when I get a call it seems to connect to both devices and it seems like pot luck as to which one will answer it! Seems daft I can't decide which device has access to which service on my own phone!
