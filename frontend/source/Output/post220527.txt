reactivate second monitor in el capitan <body> My first attempt to run el capitan 10.11.0 on one of my macintoshes is with a mac mini using a dual monitor setup.   There is one HDMI monitor Samsung Syncmaster and one DVI monitor Medion MD20429 connected via the display port with an adapter.   After getting back from sleepmode the second monitor (DVI) does not come up by itself. In system setup / monitor it does not show and only if i use the option key and click detect monitors (see e.g. http://osxdaily.com/2014/03/31/detect-displays-mac-os-x/)  will it come back.  My OS 10.9.5 Mavericks computers do not show this unwanted effect.  ul liHow can this El Capitan behavior be avoided? /li liIs there at least a one-click workaround somewhere?/li liis this a known bug to Apple?/li /ul  <answer220567> This is a two part workaround:  ol lian  applescript to click on the detect monitor/li lia bash script to run the script/li /ol  I "saved" the applescript to $HOME/source/detectmonitor.scpt (see  Run AppleScript from bash script) how to work around the issue that you can not really start with a text file ...  Then I saved the bashscript to $HOME/dm  I created a symbolic link ln -s $HOME/Desktop/detectMonitors $HOME/bin/dm  and set my Terminal preferences according to https://stackoverflow.com/a/8822669/1497139  now i can double click "detectMonitors" on my Desktop to work around the issue.  strongApplescript to click "detect monitor" in monitor system preferences/strong  see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12640643/applescript-to-run-detect-displays  precode-- Script to click the "Detect Displays" button -- 2015-12-22 WF -- see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12640643/applescript-to-run-detect-displays -- adopt to your language settings by setting the right button name below -- currently this is german "Monitore erkennen" -- to create and run this script you need a compiled scpt file to begin with see -- https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/103621/run-applescript-from-bash-script -- then you also need to set the security settings tell application "System Preferences"     activate     reveal pane "com.apple.preference.displays" end tell  delay 0.5  tell application "System Events"     tell process "System Preferences"         try --don't even consider not using a try block!             key down option             delay 0.5             --click button "Detect Displays" of window 1             click button "Monitore erkennen" of window 1             delay 0.5             key up option             tell application "System Preferences"                 quit             end tell         on error errMsg --logging out is the only other way to clear these             key up option             display dialog "ERROR: " &amp; errMsg         end try     end tell end tell /code/pre  strongBash-Script to run the applescript/strong  pre class="lang-bsh prettyprint-override"code#!/bin/bash # WF 2015-12-22 # run detect monitors cd $HOME/source/applescript osascript detectmonitor.scpt # set Terminal settings # according to https://stackoverflow.com/a/8822669/1497139 # to get this to close your terminal window exit 0 /code/pre  <comment266930> Please add some detail about the Mac, the connection methods and adaptors in use and the monitor manufacturer(s). In my Mac Mini (mid-2011) setup, I have a BenQ 27" connected via HDMI and a Dell 2009W connected via MiniDisplayPort/DVI adaptor. <comment279672> Can't you just click the Option key to toggle between the "Gather Windows" and "Detect Display" button in the Display preferences? <comment279951> Thats what I'd like to avoid: having to manually start the system preferences ...
