All windows loses focus every 5 minutes <body> While in Chrome or Sublime Text and mail for sure, my window will lose focus on 5 minute intervals. How do I determine culprit so that I can eliminate it? I've tried a reboot and closing applications that I think might be responsible and can't figure out what's actually causing the problem.  <answer285089> You can use the following Python script which can tell you which app is currently on focus:  precode#!/usr/bin/python # Prints current window focus. # See: https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/169277 from AppKit import NSWorkspace import time workspace = NSWorkspace.sharedWorkspace() active_app = workspace.activeApplication()['NSApplicationName'] print('Active focus: ' + active_app) while True:     time.sleep(1)     prev_app = active_app     active_app = workspace.activeApplication()['NSApplicationName']     if prev_app != active_app:         print('Focus changed to: ' + active_app) /code/pre  It will print active application which has the focus and any change every second.  supRelated script: Identify which app or process is stealing focus on OSX at Gist/sup  Usage:  ol liSave above script into codeget_active_focus.py/code file./li liAssign execution attributes by: codechmod +x get_active_focus.py/code command./li liRun it as: code./get_active_focus.py/code./li /ol  Output:  precode$ ./get_active_focus.py Active focus: Terminal Focus changed to: Google Chrome /code/pre  hr  Once you found the affected application, consider uninstalling or killing it (if possible).  <comment198817> look in your Console for repeating event. <comment198970> Please have a look at this answer: http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/139607/22003 If you need help to make `lastcomm` usable, just ask.
