Why is Time Machine (in 10.10.4) waiting for Spotlight to finish indexing? <body> I upgraded to 10.10.4 (from 10.10.3) yesterday … I've noticed since then that the hourly backups to my Time Capsule (4th gen, 2 TB) seem to take forever to get started ("Preparing …"). I took a look in my system.log, and there are many messages like this:  precodeJul  1 19:47:16 Musa.local com.apple.backupd[2984]: Waiting for Spotlight to finish indexing /Volumes/Time Machine Backups/Backups.backupdb Jul  1 19:57:19 Musa.local com.apple.backupd[2984]: Waiting for Spotlight to finish indexing /Volumes/Time Machine Backups/Backups.backupdb /code/pre  Not sure what could be causing this. A few others seem to have the problem as well. Rebuilding the Spotlight index of one's internal drive doesn't seem to help.  Any thoughts?
