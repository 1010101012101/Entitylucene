How many times can a iPhone 5/iPad 2 be charged with Rechargeable Tyre Inflator <body> I am thinking about buying a Rechargeable Tyre Inflator with built in USB.  Many of the devices available state the USB is compatible for Smart phone charging. But none specify what mAH total you can expect to get  from them, for example Michelin Cordless Rechargeable Tyre Inflator.  My main aim is to go camping for apprx. 4 days and I have a Power walker 10000mAH battery.  But this tends to become a charge station that others want to use and leaves me high and dry before the end of the trip.  So my main aim is to use this type of Inflator as a charge station with the expectation that by design and size it will have more mAH than the Power walker 10000mAH battery.  Roughly speaking with 10000mAH I would expect 4-5 charges on an iPhone 5.  Does any one have any experience using these as above or any clue as to how to find out or work out what to expect from them.  <comment160832> Can't answer your question completely, but the iPhone 5 has a 1440mAH battery. Based on how old it is and the number of charge cycles it has gone through, its capacity would be less than what it came with. So you could (somehow) try to find out the mAH of the charger and do a simple division by, say 1000, and figure out how many charges it will support.
