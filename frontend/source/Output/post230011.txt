Can I watch Netflix movie on iPad run on iPhone? <body> I watch Netflix when I exercise at the gym. My iPhone6 is using T-Mobile and it provides unlimited data and up to free 7GB personal hotspot per month. I use my iPad Pro to see Netflix movie on a bigger screen. However, it is limited to 7GB. Is there a way or a app to run Netflix app on iPhone and see the screen on iPad?   All screen sharing apps that I found are only for between iOS and Mac. What I want is between iPhone and iPad.  Thanks.  Sam  Edit: My iPad is not connected to T-Mobile directly. It's connected to the Personal Hotspot of iPhone. That's how my iPhone and iPad communicate. But I guess if an app runs on iPhone it won't comsume the Tethering usage even if they are connected.  <comment280673> Can you clarify whether you are already connecting your iPad to your iPhone via the iPhone's personal hotspot? Or is your iPad also connected through T-Mobile and it also has a 7GB limitation? <comment280710> no wifi at the gym, time to change the gym
