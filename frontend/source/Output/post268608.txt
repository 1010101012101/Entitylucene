Chrome on Yosemite <body> I had a number of application warn me that Snow Leopard is no longer supported, so I've updated my main system to Yosemite. (I am on a 2010 Mac Pro, BTW)   Now, Chrome is acting strangely, for a number of sites that have an embedded image I get   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/csBQE.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  That's what I see on Wolfram Alpha among other sites. It might go away for a time after restarting Chrome, but it always returns. Any idea what this is, and the fix?   <answer268644> There are a number of possible causes for this, but the first thing I would try is turning off hardware acceleration in Google Chrome. To do this, follow these steps:  ol liLaunch Google Chrome/li liGo to Chrome  Preferences (or just press the kbdcommand/kbdkbd,/kbd keyboard shortcut/li liAt the bottom of the page, click on emShow advanced settings.../em/li liLook for the strongSystem/strong subheading in the new settings that appear/li liUncheck the emUse hardware acceleration when available/em option/li liRestart Google Chrome/li /ol  Let us know how you go.  <comment337360> Do you have an Apple GPU or aftermarket? Also, is Chrome up to date? <comment337382> So far, that's it. Idiot-proof directions above (thanks) and a restart, now that mess is gone. I'll mark as 'accepted' if still gone in 24 hrs. Thanks! <comment337384> NVIDIA GeForce GT 120 - (This is aftermarket, right?) My other 2010 Pro has The ATI Radeon. Yes, Chrome is up to date. <comment337391> GT 120 should be the original, from that period. Monomeeth seems to have got it though..
