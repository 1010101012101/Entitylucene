Messages Preferences window won't launch <body> Running Sierra 10.12.6 on iMac. I recently had to jump through the second identification hoops, was re-directed to create new Apple password, which I did, was forced to enter that new password on all 6 devices, launched Messages after system reboot, and was getting a text stream from my wife's phone.  I checked both my iphone 5s and her 5SE, and the settings are appropriate, so we both get only our own text messages on our handheld devices.  I unfortunately cannot launch the Preferences window in Messages on the iMac.  The app is otherwise stable and functional, and under Accounts, nothing seems awry, but whether I click on "Preferences" in the pulldown menu in Messages or utilize the keystroke shortcut: Command/comma, nothing comes up, and it does not appear that the window is elsewhere on the desktop out of view, hidden, or minimized.  I'd be grateful for any ideas/help.  Thanks!  <comment373507> update: I took this to Apple support and after reaching a Sr. Advisor, Apple put a background recorder in effect, and took a sample of the problem behind the scenes, and it's been escalated to the engineers and I am now waiting...
