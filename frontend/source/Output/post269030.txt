Win10 / Sierra / Bootcamp - cannot see OS X partition, no CoreStorage, no FileVault <body> After installing one of the major Windows 10 updates a while ago, I lost the functionality of seeing the HFS+ partition under Windows 10. After reading up on this issue and finding a number of threads where users experience the same issue, I am still unable to find a solution that allows me to regain this function natively without the use of third-party apps such as MacDrive or Paragon.  Funny thing is that I am not running on CoreStorage and have FileVault disabled, hence cannot tell why this is not working as it supposedly is provided as part of the latest Bootcamp drivers.  Any ideas?

Give that Paragon merely installs drivers for HFS+ interaction, I tend to believe that the bootcamp drivers must have been affected during one of the Windows Updates, hence suggest others with the same problem to first re-install the bootcamp drivers before turning to Paragon.  The most up to date bootcamp drivers for your apple notebook can be found on the Windows Recovery Drive in the WinPEDriver Folder, you maybe have to assign a drive letter to the partition first (right-click "This PC"  Manage  Disk Management  right-click WINRECOVERY and click "assign Drive Letter").  Hope that helps  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uF1y8.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment337928> its a Macbook Air 13in early 2015. The additional Disks are (as far as I know, they just popped up after the Sierra and Win10 update) are 1. Win10 / 2. MAC / 3. Win10 Recovery / 4. Mac Recovery. I wouldnt worry too much about the smaller partitions, they seem legit to me. <comment337929> No, some of them don't seem legit to me: The default OS X & BootCamp layout is: 1. 200 MiB EFI 2. OS X main 3. 650 MB OS X Recovery (4. 2nd EFI) 5. Windows main 6. additional Windows partitions. The remains of the 200 MiB default EFI are still there: parts of the 2014 blocks gap and the 374824 blocks gap. <comment337930> I see that this is not the accurate partitioning, but I dont understand why this would affect the way the bootcamp drivers read the HFS volume? Can I delete the unnecessary EFI partitions via DiskUtil on MAC? Which Disk# should I delete? <comment337931> The disk0s5 EFI may be necessary: it depends on how you installed Windows 10 (either the MBR or the GPT method) and what the Win10 update has modified. In my opinion your problem is related with the missing disk0s1 OS X EFI (overwritten/replaced by the disk0s1 MS reserved partition) <comment337938> so easiest solution would be to wipe the whole HDD via OSX Recovery and then go again with Bootcamp and Win10? Thats a little overkill, isnt it? <comment337946> I would recommend a proper reinstall to not further degrade your partition scheme (e.g. after the next Win10 update), yes. It depends on the effort, of course. It is possible to replace your current disk0s1 by a proper OS X EFI. But this may break Win10 booting - I simply don't know how you installed Windows and what happened afterwards. So it would require a backup of at least the two Win partitions or better a dd of the whole disk.
