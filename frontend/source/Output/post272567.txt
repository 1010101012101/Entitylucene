Black screen with red vertical lines, then restarts in blue or grey screen on iMac Mid 2011 <body> Was doing some work on my iMac, and then I got a black screen with some small red vertical lines. I was trying to restart, then it starts up and hangs on grey or blue screen. Have then read a lot and was trying this:  ol liBoot into Single-User mode/li liExecute the following commands:  precode/sbin/fsck -fy / /sbin/mount -uw / mkdir /Disabled_System_Library_Extensions cd /Disabled_System_Library_Extensions mv /System/Library/Extensions/ATI* . mv /System/Library/Extensions/AMD* . touch /System/Library/Extensions exit /code/pre/li /ol  I got a lot of "permission was denied" for the two MV lines, I restarted and it booted fine, and no problem. Then after 30 seconds then the black screen came again.  Some websites talk about a GPU failure: http://www.macrumors.com/2014/01/17/2011-macbook-pro-gpu-glitches/ But have never seen that type of images. Can someone guide me what to do, can the NVRAM battery (if it's an old battery) cause this type of error?  I can do the fix again, but then there will go 30 seconds where it "works" and then the black screen with red lines will be shown again.  <comment342555> Sounds like the GPU is dying - the link has no relation to your issue, nor do the single user 'fixes'. <comment342623> Allan - Thats not a duplicate, bc. it's not the error i got, the lines are not so weight and you can't see the real screen image, it's a black image with red lines less then 1 pt weight, have search google, but can't find any images thats look like my error. <comment342633> The symptom may be slightly different, but the answer is the same.
