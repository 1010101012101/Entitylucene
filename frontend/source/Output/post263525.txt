Need help with Google chrome certificate transparency settings <body> I'm following this guide to disable cert transparency policy for certain domains.  So I modified the code~/Library/Preferences/com.google.Chrome.plist/code, and confirmed it with  precode%&gt; defaults read ~/Library/Preferences/com.google.Chrome.plist {     CertificateTransparencyEnforcementDisabledForUrls =     (         "static.lufaxcdn.com"     ); /code/pre  However it's not effective.   Maybe I've modified the wrong file? Anyone knows?  You can test with the following sites:  precodehttps://static.lufaxcdn.com/wcm-images/Qq2ftUycGETXm3-lLP4KNg.jpg /code/pre  <answer263527> Okay, I need to quit and restart Chrome, which is not mentioned in the document, sigh.  I also need to wait for ~1 minute, simple quit and restart may not work immediately.
