Can a TrueCrypt volume be ejected (or the app quit) upon entering sleep? <body> Is it possible to force all TrueCrypt mounted volumes to eject when my Mac goes to sleep or to have TrueCrypt quit (causing them to unmount)? I'm looking for a little extra "easy" security when I move my Mac around.  <answer70588> Per the TrueCrypt docs, the dismount option could be added to your shutdown script.  precodetruecrypt /d /code/pre  or  precodetruecrypt -d /code/pre  <comment81950> Can someone link this to or provide details how to execute a shutdown script at sleep time to complete this answer? <comment82541> Thanks for the tip! I found a few apps that'll help me do this since there is no sleep/wake script. <comment96448> @Matt, Care to share what apps you found? <comment96522> @Nate sorry, but i never really solved for it.
