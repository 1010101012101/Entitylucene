How do I remove the right side bar on Sublime Text? <body> When I work in documents with long lines, it gets very annoying because I have to very precisely drag my mouse in order not to accidentally touch that sidebar which drags me back to the beginning. (I'm talking about scrolling/marking horizontally).  <answer219312> If you are talking about the document preview it is called the emMinimap/em. It can be hidden from: strongView  Hide Minimap/strong  <comment350020> Is there a way to that permanently? <comment350025> You have to put a line in your user settings file.
