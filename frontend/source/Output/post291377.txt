Can't open iCloud in system preferences <body> I'm trying to open iCloud prefs in System Preferences, but I get a preferences error saying "could not load iCloud preference pane" (see screenshot). I have run disk permissions, and even installed a new OS using recovery mode, i can however open iCloud prefs using another user account on the same computer, any ideas anyone?   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CFIPG.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer291405> Well you have already given us the first clue as to where the issue is:     i can however open iCloud prefs using another user account on the same computer   While it is possible that a combo updater will fix the issue it is more likely (IMHO) something specific to your user profile. How I would do it.  ol liHold down the Option key while in Finder and select "Library" from the Go menu./li liYou want to look for items with "icloud" in their name and move them elsewhere. I usually use the desktop or a folder on the desktop./li liThere will be files in "Preferences" and "Application Support" and possibly elsewhere. Don't remove the folders, just any files within making note of the path each file was at./li liIt is possible that there are other files in the same locations that deal with iCloud. poke around and move ones that might qualify./li liOnce that is done, reboot and try opening that preference pane./li /ol  Note that you don't just delete the file in case the law of unintended consequences rears it's ugly head. So if things get emworse/em put the files back. But I am betting that won't happen.  I am thinking that there is a damaged preference or icloud support file somewhere in your user folder and "/Users/[USERNAME]/Library/" is the most likely place for said file to be.  A reboot should cause  macOS to rebuild the missing files and opening the iCloud preference pane should finish the job.  Note that it is possible that you will need to re-enter your iCloud account information once you get it working.  <comment367898> 'First fix' would be to get the Combo Updater for your current OS version & run it. Google for "Combo update 10.11.5" or whatever is appropriate - that should find it on Apple's site. Installing over recovery was presumably followed by a restore - which is likely to have re-imported whatever went wrong. <comment368032> Thanks Steve, I'll have a go at your suggestions over the weekend. I will of course let you know how I progress <comment369729> Hi Steve, I tried your suggestions last night and unfortunately it didn't make any difference, any further ideas would be most welcome <comment369744> Create another user account and migrate your documents and whatnot to the new user. Once everything is over, delete the old user account. Sorry thats all I got...
