Launching Character Viewer (aka CharacterPalette) from command line <body> So, recently I have being using the Character and Keyboard Viewer a fair bit and set up simple Alfred keywords that toggle the launch/quitting of these apps so as not to have to leave the keyboard.  This works splendidly for Keyboard Viewer running the applescript:  precode    if application "KeyboardViewer" is running then     tell application "KeyboardViewer" to quit else     tell application "KeyboardViewer" to activate end if /code/pre  But the same for "CharacterPalatte" (Character Viewer) which launches OK according to Activity Monitor does not show show the window!  The Character Viewer window is nowhere to be seen. It launches just fine using the menu dropdowns from the menu bar.  Any ideas?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KEFih.png" alt="CharacterPalette running, but no window")  <answer197117> My approach to launching Character Viewer ("CharacterPalette") proved otiose as there is an OS X shortcut I was previously unaware of: kbdctrl/kbd+kbdcmd/kbd+kbdspace/kbd opens character Viewer.  For reference this call in Applescript is:  precode    tell application "System Events"         key code 49 using {control down, command down}     end  /code/pre
