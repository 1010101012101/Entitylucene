How to script "add to iTunes Library" <body> I'm trying to deliver as a download a collection of audio files such that the user (preferably Win and Mac) would be able to double click on the file (perhaps a DMG? / ZIP)  and launch a script that would then add the media to the users iTunes library.  I realize that's big on concept and thin on detail --- At the moment I see it as a number of different problems.  ol liHow to create a DMG file/li lihow launch a script for the user to do the add to library when the open the DMG (or zip on Win)/li lihow to actually do the scripting (again obviously different for Mac than Win)/li /ol  I'm not expecting anybody to do the work for me, but I would appreciate pointers to suitable resources.  <answer35124> On the Mac side, you can create a DMG file with codeDisk Utility/code. Once started you can either select "New Image" to create a an empty one or use kbd&#x21E7;/kbdkbd&#x2318;/kbdkbdN/kbd to create an image based on a folder.  To copy the audio files to iTunes, it's probably easiest to just move/copy them to code~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Automatically Add to iTunes/code (may be called differently, just look at the folder first) and let iTunes (which must be running) do the rest.  <comment40013> OK, I'm liking this idea.  I didn't know about the "Add to iTunes automatically" folder.  Would there be a way to present this folder as a link in the DMG such that the user could drag and drop the files in the DMG to that folder easily.  For example, many software products that ship as a DMG have a link to the Applications folder, and the user just drags the package icon to the link and they're done. <comment40019> Hmm, might be difficult because `/Applications` is the same on all machines but `/Users/whatever/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Automatically...` depends on the user name as well as the locale (e.g. the folder is called `Automatisch zu iTunes hinzuf√ºgen` in german). Something like http://dougscripts.com/itunes/scripts/ss.php?sp=droptoaddandgiveinfo might be a better solution.
