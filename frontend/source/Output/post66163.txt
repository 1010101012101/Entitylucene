Deleted songs unintentionally <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   iOS 5 Music App Grey circle with a square inside it next to the song title - what does it indicate?       I have purchased songs on my iPhone and computer that occassionally have the symbol with a circle with a square inside it. Sometimes these songs play, sometimes they don't. When I have touched the symbol the song is erased. I don't want to erase it. What does this mean and how do I get rid of the symbol without deleteing the song?  <comment77817> The symbol is on my phone only. <comment77872> Sounds like the iTunes "Downloading" icon. Does [this question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/44139/8823) address the issue? <comment77976> I'm not sure. The symbol stays next to the song. The song will play but not always clear. I know that if I touch the symbol, the song will become deleted.
