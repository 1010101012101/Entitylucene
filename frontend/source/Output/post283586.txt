From my iPad, can I download a video from my iTunes library? <body> I have a bunch of videos on my desktop computer that I like to watch on my iPad. I normally stream them using Home Sharing, but sometimes want to download them. I know I can go to my PC, select the iPad in iTunes, and transfer the videos from there (I have Wi-Fi Sync enabled). However, is there a way to initiate this transfer over the network from the iPad instead of from the PC?
