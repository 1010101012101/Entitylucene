TextEdit files can only be accessed from TextEdit (That's how iCloud storage is made). Therefore you'll need a Mac connected to your iCloud account.   <answer110909> Go to https://developer.icloud.com and click on documents. You will find com~apple~TextEdit and you can download files but can't upload files.  <comment116952> The answer to this question is basically the same as that seen here: [How to I access documents saved in iCloud with Mountain Lion on my iOS device](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/57681/how-to-i-access-documents-saved-in-icloud-with-mountain-lion-on-my-ios-device) <comment130570> Doesn't this require a (free) developer account? <comment142391> No, it has nothing to do with apple's developer account and works for every iCloud account.
