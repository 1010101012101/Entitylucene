How to disable default keyboard layout shorcut in OS X 10.8? <body> When I select the "Simplified Pinyin" layout in Mac OS X 10.8, the shortcut kbdShift/kbd+kbd6/kbd is assigned to "Display smileys" (see screenshot below).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Exwuc.png" alt="enter image description here"  However, since this is a French keyboard, kbdShift/kbd+kbd6/kbd is normally to print the number 6, which means I can no longer type this number.  Is there any way to disable or change this keyboard shortcut?  strongEdit:/strong  I've tried reassigning the menu item to a different shortcut but that didn't work:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/97yO8.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Is there any other way to change or remove this shortcut?  <answer108123> You can change the shortcuts from the keyboard preference pane:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hlyY0.png" alt=""  In 10.9 the Show Punctuation and Show Facemarks menu items were combined into a single item that has option-shift-B as the shortcut.  On some keyboards you can also insert 6 by pressing fn-O.  <comment127273> I've just tried this but unfortunately it didn't work (see updated post). <comment127290> @Laurent Did you try typing at least one character using the Pinyin input method? New shortcuts seem to be registered only after the input method is used. <comment127331> Yes thanks, it's working now. It looks like I needed to restart my computer for it to work.
