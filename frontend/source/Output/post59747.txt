How do I get two status-bar clocks with different timezones? <body> I'd like to have one clock in my status bar set to the same timezone as my servers.  I've found three applications that will allow me to add another clock:  ul liDay-O/li liMenuCalendarClock/li liiClock/li /ul  but they all use the system time (which I'd like to keep as-is).  Are there any applications that allow timezone-munging inside the app, or will I need to write this myself?  <answer59749> Would having a menubar clock that displays other timezones in a drop-down menu work? I find iStat Menus works for me for seeing other timezones easily, albeit not as easily as having the time in the timezone you want shown right there. It's commercial software, but there are similar open source project out there. Maybe one of them does the "other timezones in the dropdown" thing?  <answer97232> Lovers clock might be the one you are looking for  https://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/26202/loversclock  <answer197032> World time widget  Try this app  <answer214495> Status clock is free, and available from the mac app store:  https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/status-clock/id552792489?mt=12  Worth a look too: https://github.com/palaniraja/mclock  Note: Loversclock, mentioned in another post, didn't download.  <answer261937> I would also really like to display multiple times in my menu bar, but I'm not able to find anything like that either. I landed on Clocker. It's free and you can easily assign a keyboard shortcut which is really nice.  <answer264066> There is a free option. Install BitBar and then the World Clock plugin from:  https://getbitbar.com/plugins/Time/worldclock.1s.sh  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DL9G2.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment69786> It's ok, but not ideal.  I'll take a look, thanks. <comment102898> Are you certain this isn't supported natively? I doubt you will have to install a 3rd party application for something so simple. <comment114084> Are you in some way affiliated? <comment122763> While it's hardly the prettiest thing I've seen, this does exactly what I want, and it's GPLed.  Thanks! <comment268317> Lovers works, but it does NOT work with the new "dark" menubar in OSX. Whereas mclock mentioned by @Ioannis below does adjust its text color. (https://github.com/palaniraja/mclock) <comment307946> download from the link no longer functional. <comment332036> Yes! This is a very nice, free solution. <comment343837> mclock is also free. You can download the binary from github. You can pay if you want by downloading it from app store.
