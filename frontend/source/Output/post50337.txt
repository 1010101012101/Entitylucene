Opening/viewing iCal in Windows <body> I have this one condition:  The boss is using mac, the secretary is using PC. The boss keep all the schedules in iCal,  and now the secretary cannot manage and see the schedules because i dont know how to open or view iCal in Windows.  Is there any third party software that can do this?  <answer58320> You can try Moo Calendar, it supports iCalendar format. If you have a Google Calendar account, you can use it to sync calendar with Google Calendar.   <comment57700> Does he use a syncing service like Google or iCloud? Or are the calendars only available locally? <comment57709> No, thats the problem, why? If the boss is using iCloud is that can help? <comment57734> Well, if he chooses to sync his calendars to iCloud or Google, he can give others access to his calendars online.
