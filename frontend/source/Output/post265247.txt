Can I choose or influence the two kinds of transition animation while switching between desktops? <body> Recently I noticed that there are two kinds of transition animation when switching between desktops.    ul liSometimes the background picture slides with the desktop, and sometimes the background keeps still./li /ul  How can I set which transition animation to use using MacBook Pro, macOS Sierra?  <answer269000> I noticed it too and I have been looking everywhere to find a way to change the animation. I find the one with the fixed background way better than the classic one. A reddit user asked that question and posted a video of the effect, here's the link to the post: https://www.reddit.com/r/OSXTweaks/comments/5hv924/request_fixed_background_while_desktop_switching/?st=ixzu7113&amp;sh=a3e1ddfb  Very interested if you have found something !  <comment333598> I'm not seeing this. The only 2 transitions I get are 'slides intact from one to the other' or 'one slides out nicely, the other is totally black until after the transition, then pops into place'. 1st is done with Ctrl/numpad 2nd by Ctrl/arrow. <comment337894> Welcome to Ask Different!
