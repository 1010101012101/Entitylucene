Not getting developer option on iPad air <body> In settings I am not getting developer option. Tried with Xcode 6.1.1 (no clue). can any one help to enable developer option on iPad air.  <answer237034> The developer item in settings (called "ontwikkelaar" in the screenshot) will become available when you have installed an app you created with xcode. Creating a simple empty app with xcode, connecting your ipad and then tun it on the device should be enough to display the developer item in your settings.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uIRLO.jpg" alt="developer item in settings" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3PiUT.jpg" alt="developer item opened in settings"  <comment290191> What iOS version your iPad has? With the later versions you can not see anything different on your iPad.
