How can I rename multiple pictures simultaneously? <body> For example,I have 20 pictures downloaded from the Internet. They have some crazy names like "XFGHDHR345" or "SDEREWQ230", and I want to name them:  "Picture 1"br "Picture 2"br "Picture 3"br "Picture 4"br "Picture 5"br .....br "Picture 20"br  I don't want to type them one by one. I want to change their names at once.   Is there a way to do this?  <answer87164> Using the built-in tool "Automator", you can define a workflow to batch rename files.  To do that, you will have to:  ol liOpen strongAutomator/strong emfind it using Spotlight or in /Applications/em/li liCreate a new strongWorkflow/strong/li liType get into the search field img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IYib4.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liScroll to the bottom of the list of items and drag strongGet Specified Item/strong from the strongFiles &amp; Folders/strong actions list on the left panel and drop it into the right panel/li liClick the strongAdd/strong button and find your files/li liAdd the strongSort Finder Items/strong action followed by strongRename Finder Items/strong/li liIt the strong"Rename Finder Items"/strong panel, select strong"Make Sequential"/strong and strong"Add number to"/strong emPicture/em/li liHit the strongplay/strong button and you should be done/li /ol  Have a look here or here for an example tutorials on your specific renaming task at hand. An excellent overview of what Automator does and how powerful (and simple) it can be as a personal assistant - see the web page http://macosxautomation.com/automator/index.html  <answer87166> Yes, you can use Terminal:  ol liMove all your pictures to a temporary folder on the Desktop, for example  codeTemp/code./li liOpen ApplicationsUtilitiesTerminal.app./li liChange directory to codeTemp/code:  precodecd ~/Desktop/Temp /code/pre  where code~/code is expanded to your home directory (that is, code/Users/&lt;yourusername&gt;/code.)/li liRun this compound shell command:  precoden=1; for file in *; do mv "$file" "Picture $n"; let n++; done /code/pre  where:  ul licodefor ...; do ...; done/code loops over your 20 files. codefile/code is the variable that holds filenames. See this article for more information./li licoden/code, initially set to 1 and increased by one in every iteration with codelet n++/code, is the integer suffix for the renamed files./li licodemv "$file" "Picture $n"/code renames the files. code$n/code is the value of variable coden/code./li /ul  The shell command is equivalent to:  precodemv SDEREWQ230 "Picture 1" mv XFGHDHR345 "Picture 2" mv YWUU7738DT "Picture 3" (...) /code/pre/li /ol  For more information on the bash shell see man bash. For more information on shell scripting see this guide at the Apple developer website.  <answer87194> If you don't want to use the Terminal or Automator, there are commercial apps with a GUI for doing this. One is A Better Finder Rename, which has a free trial version.  <answer87238> If you want to zero-pad the numbers or if the files have different extensions:  precodei=1; for f in *; do mv "$f" Picture\ $(printf %03d $i).${f#*.}; let i++; done /code/pre  More examples:  precode# lowercase (Bash 4) and replace spaces with underscores for f in *; do f2=${f,,}; mv "$f" "${f2// /_}"; done  # number based on modification date IFS=$'\n'; i=1; for f in $(ls -rt *.jpg); do mv "$f" $(printf %04d $i).jpg; let i++; done  # file-5.jpg to file-005.jpg for f in *; do b=${f%.*}; x=${f#*.}; mv "$f" "${b%-*}-$(printf %03d ${b#*-}).$x"; done /code/pre  <answer87496> I will recommend here NameChanger application. Its very simple and fast to use.  Very good options given there for renaming files with different criteria.   <answer171488> If you have Yosemite, it is built into Finder. Just select the files, rightclick and choose "Rename emn/em files". Then change the dropdown to "Filter" and voila! You have batch renaming options!  <comment101867> This is a much better explanation of using the shell to handle file edits than [we have over there](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/75114/any-easy-way-to-search-for-replace-characters-in-jpg-file-names-in-a-folder). Granted, that example is a simple edit - all files with pattern ABC need to be renamed to 123 so this has to be slightly more complex. +2 if I had two votes. <comment101869> Nice example of Automator - it's clearly intended for this case to clean up photo files. I'll add in the grandfather of Automator resources, Sal Saghoian's http://macosxautomation.com/automator/index.html <comment101881> For those who have Photoshop, it does a really nice job at easily doing just this. <comment101885> +1: Didn't know you could do that with Automator. <comment101929> +1 for ABFR -- while it does cost $20, it quite easily handles this particular task, where the initial filenames are random, and many other more complex batch renaming tasks besides. <comment101978> @Jadav I don't think you're counting keystrokes correctly here. Even if you key around the Finder and hit Enter on each instead of clicking, it's still more efficient to run the script, even if you're only doing 20 pictures. <comment101979> Compared to the Automator solution ! But newer than less that is some impressive programing on your side. <comment101980> HOLA @Lauri Ranta, was that English :), or is the computer going up in smoke after doing that to it ? <comment102519> I always like to point out the option of using commercial utility apps with a nice GUI because many casual users find that using the Terminal or Automator is too difficult for some tasks. ABFR is an example of a refined product that is very flexible and works well. For many users, spending $20 is a better option than learning the complexities of rarely-used text commands. You can decide which you would rather use. <comment201755> Wow! Hadn't noticed that one yet. Also includes options for adding text, and some fancier formatting actions. Operation is undoable by Finder. <comment208173> Wow! Thank you for this. I can't believe it took only 1.5 seconds to rename about 50 images. Then, @badabamn, that solution was even quicker!!! Thanks to all!
