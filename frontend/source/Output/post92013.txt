How to install Windows 8 with BootCamp 5 Assistant via USB? <body> I was able to put Windows 8 setup files on my usb from the installer. Now I just upgraded my machine to Mountain Lion. I have gone through the BC Assistant and it only asks for my Windows CD to be put into my drive. There is no longer an option to install via other media.   Anyone know of a workaround to install with USB stick?  <answer92227> This doesn't exactly answer your question but may help solve your problem: create a bootable Windows DVD from the Windows 8 setup files, as explained  here.  I did it myself some months ago when upgrading Windows XP to Windows 8, and it worked without a hitch.  You will need:  ul liAccess to a Windows computer./li licodeoscdimg.exe/code, a command-line tool for creating bootable Windows ISO files.

PWBoot (Portable Windows Boot) aims to simplify the process of making Windows Operating System to boot from any USB storage devices.  <comment108274> Does your system meet the requirements under  "Can I use a downloaded (ISO) version of Windows with Boot Camp?"  here: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5639 ? <comment144569> The question was about creating the USB installer, not installing to a USB disk. However, have you verified that this works to boot Windows from a Mac? In my experience this procedure works to create the USB installation but it won't boot on a Mac. <comment144570> The question is about installation from USB, not from a DVD.
