How can I decline a call in iPhone when the screen was locked? <body> I have an iPhone 4S. I really don't know in which basis it shows Answer/Decline buttons when someone calling me. Sometimes it shows both buttons and sometimes it only show the option "Slide to answer".  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZtFuE.png" alt="enter image description here"  The scenarios are,  ul liThe iPhone is locked/unlocked/li liThe iPhone is in normal mode/silent mode/li /ul  Note: I does not use Voice mail. I just need the "Decline" button in any mode/ any situation, because the mobile mode should not decide to hide the decline button. The owner of the mobile should decide it!  <answer66653> Push the power button on the top of the phone twice. The first time, the call is silenced. The 2nd time the call is rejected/directed to voice mail (if set up).  <answer66654> h3When the phone is locked (the screen is off)/h3  On strongiOS 6/strong, it show slide to answer and a little phone, that, when you slide it up, shows more options, such as accept / decline and more options.  On strongiOS 5/strong, it only shows slide to answer. Like Mark said, tap the power button once to silence the call, twice to reject it.  h3When the phone is in use (screen on, unlocked)/h3  On strongAll versions since the beginning of time/strong, it will show Accept / Deny buttons.  <answer189938> Double-press the power button.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/r2HVN.png" alt="Finger pressing power button"  <answer202873> So, Simple Tap the power button 1st time for slient the call and 2nd time for cancel the call  <comment78501> Are you on iOS 5 or 6? <comment78502> I am having iOS5 <comment78533> Thanks. Am I the only one who finds this totally non-obvious? :) Why aren't there buttons on the screen for this? <comment78541> By the way, you can push any hardware button on the iPhone to silence a call, it doesn't have to be the power button. <comment169498> same issue on iOS 7.1 <comment244686> Exactly what the accepted answer said. <comment244705> @Tetsujin: means using the phone power button at top <comment244719> Welcome to AskDifferent.
