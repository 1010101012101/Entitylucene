Why can't I access HTTPS sites through my iPhone's hotspot? <body> I can access HTTP and HTTPS sites from the iPhone without any problems. However, when I use the iPhone as a hotspot and connect my laptop to the it, I can't access HTTPS sites from the laptop.  It's almost as if there's a firewall on the iPhone, but this link says that there isn't.  What else could it be?  <comment367132> Can you access https sites from your laptop when you're connected elsewhere? <comment367407> @Little.Eden: Yes, I can.
