How can I open all the files in all the subdirectories of a folder? <body> I'm trying to recursively open all the files in a folder, including its directories. I've been playing around with codeopen /path/to/folder/*/code, and this will open all the files inside that folder but not include the sub-directories.   If I had a folder tree that looked like this:  precodeFolder &gt;subfolder1 &gt;&gt;file1.jpg &gt;&gt;file2.jpg &gt;subfolder2 &gt;&gt;file1.jpg &gt;&gt;file2.jpg &gt;subfolder3 &gt;&gt;file.jpg /code/pre  How could I open all the files in one terminal command?  <answer91816> I would suggest   precodefind . | xargs open /code/pre  <comment107884> Note that this has the potential to massively slow down / crash your system if you run it in the wrong folder... =P It won't ask if you really want to open every single file on your computer. <comment152463> As a side note, you can also use "find ./*/*.jpg | xargs open" if there are non jpg files that you want to ignore. <comment152507> I would rather use `find . -name "*.jpg"`
