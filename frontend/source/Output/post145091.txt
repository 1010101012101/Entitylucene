How long is it safe to store an unopened iPod Classic? <body> I just bought an iPod classic after the discontinuation, and I already have a working one, so I just want to store this one until its needed.  How long is it ok to just leave it in the box? I read once that you're not supposed to let a battery sit with no charge in it, and the date on the iPod box says 2009, meaning this thing almost definitely has no charge right? Should I start it on charge cycles or just leave it in the box?  <answer145093> I would recommend to:  Charge the battery to about 30%  Read more here:  Store it in dry and cool place.  <comment170998> Why? What's special about charging to 20%? <comment171000> It is the recommended charge to store batteries. When you buy a new device there is always some charge in it, that is the same reason. <comment171001> But why that number? That's a very specific number to put out there without much of an explanation. <comment171004> @IanC. see this for more details http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/how_to_store_batterie
