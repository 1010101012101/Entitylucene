Calendar in list but not in sidebar <body> I loaded the My Meetups Calendar from meetup.com into my gmail account which I synchronize with Calendar.app. The My Meet up a calendar is in the calendars list in the menu, but not in the sidebar, and that means I have to specifically open a separate window to see the events on my meetups.   Illustration:img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VpsG4.png" alt="enter image description here"  How can I fix thhis?  <answer157213> I solved this by going to Preferences (codeâŒ˜+,/code) - Accounts - Google Account - Delegation (tab) - Click on My Meetups.  I can now see the meetups in the calendar :)  strongWarning/strong: This is a viable solution only, of course, if you don't use the delegation feature - If you do, you will give (unneccesary?) access to your Meet ups to your delegates, which may not be what you want.
