IPad email client refuses to retrieve some emails <body> This is an original iPad using the default client against a remote IMAP account. It just does not retrieve mails from certain senders. They're not in other folders, they're Not in junk mail, Outlook has no problem retrieving them. It being an iPad I presume there's nothing as uncouth as a log file to look at, so I'm at a loss. Anyone know why?  <comment33036> You can look at a log file for any iOS device if you connect it to the computer and run the http://www.apple.com/support/iphone/enterprise/ iphone configuration utility, it has a log section. This probably wont help you in this specific situation, but I just wanted to let you know that does exist. <comment33046> Thanks! Or I could jailbreak it I suppose ...
