Is it possible to take a screenshot of a dashboard in OS X? <body> I'm using a kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd Shift ⇧ /kbd kbd 5 /kbd command to take a screenshot of a desktop, but it doesn't work if I switch to the dashboard.   Is there any way to take a screenshot of dashboard elements?   <answer164229> I'm assuming you set up kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd Shift ⇧ /kbd kbd 5 /kbd yourself, as it's not a System default.  If you use kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd Shift ⇧ /kbd kbd 4 /kbd then you can drag a marquee round the item you want, or even use kbd Space /kbd afterwards to grab the entire floating widget, examples below…  ol liUsing kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd Shift ⇧ /kbd kbd 4 /kbdbr Note the hard edges &amp; visible background.br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rl0U8.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liUsing kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd Shift ⇧ /kbd kbd 4 /kbd  followed by kbd Space /kbd then clicking the desired 'window'/widget.br Note the soft edges with shadowsbr img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KiN1I.png" alt="enter image description here"/li /ol  <comment192489> I can't reproduce this on OS X Yosemite (I can take screenshots using ⇧⌘3 and ⇧⌘4 (⇧⌘5 is not a default shortcut). What version of OS X are you using? Are you using Dashboard as a space or overlay? <comment192494> Cmd+Shift+5 is the sequence used by [Captured](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/captured/id414675451?mt=12) -- a popular screen capture and auto-share tool for OS X. They might be using that. <comment192497> @Tetsujin Thank you, it worked like magic! <comment192498> Welcome - glad it worked for you :) <comment192507> cmd shift 5 is the default for Skitch and Captured are you using either of those? <comment192653> @dstarh I use Skitch, but Cmd + Shift + 4 worked for me (see the answer below)
