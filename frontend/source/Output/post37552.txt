Anyone knows how many mAh in iPod Touch 4th generation battery? <body> Does anyone know how many mAh does the iPod Touch 4th generation battery have? Seems like Apple doesn't provide this particular info.  <answer37553> 930 mAh (3.44 watt hours). Up from the previous generation's 789 mAh (2.92 watt hours) battery.  Sources: [1] [2]  <answer37555> strongiFixit/strong disassembled the 4th generation iPod touch.  On their photo, you can see that the battery has strong3.44Wh/strong.br This calculates to strong930mAh/strong since the battery runs at strong3.7V/strong.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1acgb.gif" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KzKa1.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment42618> You could search for an image of the factory battery in a photo that someone takes of an iPod Touch that they opened up. Ideally the battery would have its capacity labeled, unless it's an Apple part or Apple had the product details obscured (which happens a lot with Apple devices, I hear). I'm searching for such an image now. <comment42620> You won this round! :)
