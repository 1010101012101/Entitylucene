OSx internet recovery mode how to bypass battery hardware check <body> I am running MacbookPro 2012, 4x2=8GB RAM, SSD 128 GB. somehow, SSD went runout and then whole OSX went crash last night, I tried a lot command+R but it seems its not working but transfering me to internet recovery mode, where there is another issue, it performs hardware check but my battery is a dead tool for last few months, and because of it, it sucks. how can I avoid this , should I unplug battery connection from motherboard or is there any other way to install OSX. I do not have any other Mac to download new OS.
