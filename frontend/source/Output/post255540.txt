Strange UNTITLED Volume appeared <body> Whilst trying to format an SD card through terminal I noticed that a "strange" volume named codeUNTITLED/code existed in code/Volumes//code as shown below (line 7):  precodesh-3.2# ls -al /Volumes/ total 8 drwxrwxrwt@  5 root  admin   170 Oct  2 14:31 . drwxr-xr-x  35 root  wheel  1258 Oct  2 13:59 .. lrwxr-xr-x   1 root  admin     1 Oct  2 13:59 Macintosh HD -&gt; / drwxrwxrwx   0 root  wheel     0 Oct  2 14:31 MobileBackups d--x--x--x+  3 root  admin   102 Sep 24 13:11 UNTITLED /code/pre  However, when I perform a codediskutil list/code, it is nowhere to be found (UUID voluntarily zeroed out in line 12):  precodesh-3.2# diskutil list /dev/disk0 (internal, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.3 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:          Apple_CoreStorage Macintosh HD            499.4 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3 /dev/disk1 (internal, virtual):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD           +499.0 GB   disk1                                  Logical Volume on disk0s2                                  00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000                                  Unencrypted /code/pre  When I perform a codedf -h/code it only shows me what is inside code/dev/disk1/code, so the information there seems useless in this case.  In order to gain access inside this volume I had do codesudo su/code hence the codesh-3.2#/codein front of every command results shown here. An codels -al/code gives the following:  precodesh-3.2# ls -al total 0 d--x--x--x+ 3 root  admin  102 Sep 24 13:11 . drwxrwxrwt@ 5 root  admin  170 Oct  2 14:31 .. drwx------+ 3 root  admin  102 Sep 24 13:11 .Spotlight-V100 /code/pre  And inside code.Spotlight-V100/code there's this:  precodesh-3.2# ls -al total 16 drwx------+ 3 root  admin   102 Sep 24 13:11 . d--x--x--x+ 3 root  admin   102 Sep 24 13:11 .. -rw-------  1 root  admin  4683 Sep 24 13:11 VolumeConfiguration.plist /code/pre  3 questions so far:  ul liDoes anyone else have this Volume?/li liHow to know what space it occupies?/li liCan I reclaim used space (even if very small) as suggested in the response of this question? (in other words: codesudo ls -laOR /Volumes/UNTITLED/code)/li /ul  <comment318279> Are you sure it's not just a placeholder used as the card is being formatted? <comment318807> Yes, Tetsujin. As a matter of fact, the computer has been restarted many times (without any SD card inserted) and this Volume continues to **appear in Terminal** only. **Neither** does it appear in the **GUI** (i.e. Finder) **nor** in **Disk Utility**.
