It has not been updated in some time, but it is absolutely usable. —and it’s open-source.  He has also released something more recent called Decibel. I have no experience with it, but it has the same capabilities as Play and focuses on the audiophiles. Decibel is not open-source but has support for more formats.  <answer14457> The FLAC community does a good job listing resources to play these files on all OS. Have you looked over their website to see your Mac options?  <comment12914> What do you use? <comment12915> iTunes :)   Why don't you use iTunes?  Is it due to the flac support?
