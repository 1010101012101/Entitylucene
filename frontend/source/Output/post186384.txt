Cannot type shift L in Terminal <body> As title says, I cannot type 'L' (uppercase letter) in Terminal. When I type 'bind -p' 'L' do not appear on the list. I have no problem typing l (lowercase letter). I cannot paste in 'L' neither.  Edit: I can type 'L' in cat. I can type any other letters in both upper and lowercase letters.  <comment220010> What happens if you type/paste it, just nothing? If you paste "HELLO", what happens? Do you have an `.inputrc` file in your home directory? <comment220034> Nothing happens. I do not have an .inputrc. <comment220036> Does it work when you are in e.g. `cat` and not on the prompt? <comment220133> So you can't paste `HELLO` either? Can you paste `TEXT`? <comment220167> I can write HELLO in 'cat'. <comment225425> What happens if you load a new shell or a clean shell with no options? (*E.g.,* start a `zsh` session, or start a fresh shell session with `bash --norc` and/or `bash --noprofile`) <comment225436> Still no capital L.
