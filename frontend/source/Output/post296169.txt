Display single double width chars in iterm3 <body> I have a battery-emoji in my prompt when the laptop is on battery power. Because this is a double width char and iterm has issues with it, my prompt is broken. One char after the prompt sign is swallowed because iterm calculates wrong terminal width.  To be clear: I have no issue with the emoji overlapping its next char or anything. I deliberately put it at the end of the line and I'm happy with that. I cannot put anything after the battery emoji because of the double width issues but this is emnot the problem I need to solve here/em.  The problem is that iTerm calculates a wrong width for the line where the emoji is (which is my prompt) and I want to know if there is a way to tell iTerm to calculate that correctly.
