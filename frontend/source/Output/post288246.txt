Black screen after login and frozen loading wheel <body> I am trying to help a friend with their machine. They are using an iMac (3-4 years old) running 10.12.  At first, their issue was at login. They would get to the login screen, enter their password, see the loading wheel for 1-2 seconds, then the screen would black out. But the machine is still on. Happened for a few times.  Now, though. It just powers on, get to the first loading screen, and then freezes. Tried multiple times. Same thing.  I wasn't sure what to do, so I had them follow this guide, What to do when your Mac displays a blank screen and the cursor after a macOS update.  ul liI had them reset the PRAM three times./li liThen boot to Single User Mode, and enter the commands in the article./li liThere seemed to be some errors in the drive, but I am not qualified to interpret them./li liHere are screenshots of all the entries and readouts in Single User Mode./li /ul  img src="https://i.imgur.com/EzmOEga.jpg" alt="Screenshot#1"  img src="https://i.imgur.com/iQ9ljfB.jpg" alt="Screenshot#2"  img src="https://i.imgur.com/Ez9OOPJ.jpg" alt="Screenshot#3"  What seems to be the issue, and what should I have them do next?  <answer288796> the part you want to pay attention to is the      CoreStorageGroup::completeIORequest - error 0xe000002ca detected for   LVG "Macintosh HD" (...) disk2: I/O error.   I Googled that error code and found a few reports online of people with that issue.  It looks to me like your hard-drive is failing (but that may not be true - it's just a guess).. any time I see the "I/O error", I typically assume the data is in jeopardy even if there's a chance it might not be.  You want to be as safe as possible.  I hope you have backups .. if you don't, you'll want to treat this situation as though you could lose all your data.  emHire a professional to make backups of your hard-drive and advise you on your best next steps./em  It never hurts to talk to Apple, if it's under warranty they may be able to help.  If not, you'll want to decide if you want to get a new hard-drive put in (depending on the year your iMac was manufactured, it could be very easy or very difficult) or just buy a new iMac.  <comment364749> Most likely your HDD has crashed.
