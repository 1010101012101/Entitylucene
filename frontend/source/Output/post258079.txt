May I delete cache and application support for Xcode? I'm using App cleaner <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mwinJ.png" alt="enter image description here"  I downloaded Appcleaner from App store and want to clean up to get some more space.  I have two versions of Xcode; 7.3 and 8.0. So there's no problem with two executable files but I'm wondering what that 'Application support' files are for. The bigger one takes up almost 19 gigabytes..  May i delete that one?  <comment322527> While this is not a direct answer, [this article](http://ajithrnayak.com/post/95441624221/xcode-users-can-free-up-space-on-your-mac) is a few years old but provides info on Xcode folders and what they're used for. You can see if it's safe to delete.  Credit to [this StackOverflow answer](http://stackoverflow.com/q/33322832/3487310).
