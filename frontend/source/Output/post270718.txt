"Accountsd wants to use the 'iCloud' keychain" <body> I, too, am suddenly getting this message.  I don't see a Keychain First Aid option in Keychain, and the two Login Keychain Settings were already unlocked.  Any other ideas for what the error message is all about, and what I should do about it?  <answer272642> A reboot solved this issue for me.  I had this same pesky popup with no apparent source. There were actually two of them:  precodeacountsd wants to use the "iCloud" keychain. Address Book Source Sync wants to use the "Local Items" keychain. /code/pre  Clicking 'cancel' on the first one would cause it to reload instantly, so there was no way to opt out of responding.  I closed all open applications and restarted, apparently resolving the issue. Several things make me nervous about this: (a) The persistent behavior of the modal, (b) the lack of clear source and reference,  and (c) the request for password on keychain which I never use. Is this a new virus?

It's likely a bad certificate if you owe accept one time. The error message you get setting up again will be more helpful
