iPhoto update not available <body> iPhoto won't open on my computer, insisting I need to update before using it, but when I click "check for updates" it informs me that there are no updates in the Australian store!!  Very frustrating, I don't use it a lot, but annoying that I can't use it until I update with a non-existent update!  Is there anyway around this? I'm not sure if I can download it from another countries store?  Lou  <answer217404> Does iPhoto show up under codePurchased/code tab of your codeMac App Store/code? If yes, you can try deleting the app from strong/Applications/strong and try installing (downloading) it again from codePurchased/code tab.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0kzg4.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xneQ0.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment262802> Please edit your question and add tags to indicate what version of Mac OS X is on your Mac, (or what version of Windows is on your PC,) and the current installed version of iTunes.
