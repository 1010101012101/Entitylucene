To give STDIN for Sed? <body> Pseudocommand   precodeecho '1,2,3,5' | sed -n data.txt /code/pre  which gives  precodesed: 1: "data.txt": extra characters at the end of d command /code/pre  I want to give linenumbers for search from other command.  Actually awk is giving those numbers from this thread.   data.txt:  precodehello  amigo this line 3 and here we go 4 and 5 is here /code/pre  where output should be   precodehello  amigo this line 3 and 5 is here /code/pre  How can you give sed those linenumbers?  <answer191682> Basically you can do something like  precodeeval $(echo sed $(for i in 1 2 3 5; do echo "-e ${i}p"; done) -n data.txt ) /code/pre  hr  To read the line numbers from a file containing the numbers, separated by space, use  precodeeval $(echo sed $(for i in $(&lt; line-numbers.txt); do echo "-e ${i}p"; done) -n data.txt ) /code/pre  In this case, you can use emany/em command which produces a list of line number instead of the code&lt; line-numbers.txt/code part.  hr  Or, if the numbers in the file are separated by code,/code  precodeeval $(echo sed $(for i in $(tr \, ' ' &lt; line-numbers.txt); do echo "-e ${i}p"; done) -n data.txt ) /code/pre  (and again, the command can be anything producing line numbers separated by code,/code)  <answer191712> Another way is using codesed/code with codexargs/code.  precodeecho '1p;2p;3p;5p' filename | xargs sed -n /code/pre  Basically codesed/code uses the format code&lt;line-number&gt;p/code to display a line. You can separate several lines using code;/code.  <answer191727> Assuming the output from your codeawk/code command is code1,2,3,5/code, you can do this:  precodesed -n $(my_awk_commamd | sed 's/,/p;/g;s/$/p;/') data.txt /code/pre  The codesed/code inside the code$(/code command substitution converts code1,2,3,5/code to the sed expression code1p;2p;3p;5p;/code, which is then interpreted by the outer codesed/code over the data file.  A unit test, replacing awk with a simple codeecho/code:  precode$ sed -n $(echo '1,2,3,5' | sed 's/,/p;/g;s/$/p;/') data.txt  hello  amigo this line 3 and 5 is here $ /code/pre  <comment227702> Any better idea how to do this better? I am really open to any innovation. To get linenumbers from a command and give them to Sed. <comment227704> How do say `i in [numbers-in-file]`? I tried `i in data.txt` unsuccessfully, also unsuccessfully `i in \`cat data.txt\``. data.txt here `1,2,3`. <comment227706> `data.txt` contains the text, doesn't it? You can do `for i in $(cat line-numbers.txt); do` but this requires the numbers to be separated by space, not by comma. <comment227707> or use `$(cat line-numbers.txt | tr , ' ')` to replace comma by space. <comment227792> and assuming you can't change the input you can do `echo 1,2,3,5|sed -e 's/,/p;/' -e 's/$/p filename/'|xargs sed -n`
