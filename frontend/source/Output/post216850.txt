How to make USB drives connect again in OS X <body> In the following I'll try to explain and ask in the best way I can. I couldn't find any solution for my problem using Google. So if there are any solutions, please point me to them. If you need more information to help out please let me know which information you need.  I don't have lots of information on my problem as I come from a Linux world and don't have experience using OS X. I tried to add a line to code/etc/fstab/code in order to permanently mount a network share.  I added a new line to OS X Yosemite's code/etc/fstab/code using codevi/code. After reboot code/etc/fstab/code disappeard. Consequences:  ul liInternal HDD (second drive) didn't mount anymore./li liUSB drives didn't appear on Desktop./li /ul  Thus I made some research and learned:  ul liUsed codevifs/code to edit code/etc/fstab/code./li licode/etc/fstab/code is depricated./li liDisk Utility does not help.  ul liShow usb-stick but cannot mount. Error: 'Mount failed. The disk "" could not be mounted. Try running First Aid on the disk and then retry mounting.'/li li'Verify Disk' says everything is ok/li li'Repair Disk' also works fine/li /ul/li liIt is hard to find information on this topic./li liIf I mount drive manually using codemount/code as root user, drive appears in GUI and seems to be fully accessible (ex. can be "savely removed")./li liMy problem could be somehow related to code/etc/auto_master/code and code/etc/autofs.conf/code.  precode$ cat /etc/autofs.conf | grep -v ^# |sort | uniq  AUTOMOUNTD_MNTOPTS=nosuid,nodev AUTOMOUNTD_NOSUID=TRUE AUTOMOUNT_TIMEOUT=3600  $ cat /etc/auto_master # # Automounter master map # +auto_master        # Use directory service /net            -hosts      -nobrowse,hidefromfinder,nosuid /home           auto_home   -nobrowse,hidefromfinder /Network/Servers    -fstab /-          -static /Volumes        auto_custom /code/pre/li /ul  I managed to create an entry in code/etc/fstab/code so second drive mountes again.  strongMy Questions:/strong  ul liWhat shall I do to make USB drives mount again using GUI only?/li liWhat happend? Why did code/etc/fstab/code disappear?/li /ul  <answer216855> Removing entry:  precode    /Volumes        auto_custom /code/pre  In code/etc/auto_master/code answered first question and solved my issue.
