Turn off swipe on Gmail app for iPhone? <body> Recently a new version of the Gmail app for iPhone has been pushed out. Among other changes, it added a "swipe to archive" feature. Thing is, I don't like that because I routinely accidentally swipe messages. I realize there's a brief chance to undo that shows up in the bottom, but is there a way to simply turn off the swipe functionality?
