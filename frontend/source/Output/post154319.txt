iPhoto pics can't be accessed <body> I have iPhoto 2011 on Mac Book pro.  I have an iPhone 4.  at some point my photos got synched from my MacBook pro to my phone.   When I saw this, I deleted my phone pics.  Now I cannot access any photos on my Mac Book.  I get this message"The volume for “DSC_4832.JPG” cannot be found."  how can i get access to my pics, please?
