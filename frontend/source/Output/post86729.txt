get a notification when my machine is pinged <body> I'd like to be able to be notified in any way (sound, notification, growl, etc) when someone pings my machine.  Is that possible?  <answer86767> Little Snitch may have the feature you want. It allows you to set up rules on network traffic, both inbound and outbound, mostly for blocking unwanted traffic, but I believe it can perform arbitrary actions such as notification for specific rules and types of traffic like ICMP pings.  There's a trial version that you can use to test.  I have no affiliation with Little Snitch or the company behind it.  <answer87291> Here is a 1st draft of a simple sonar:  precode$ cat &gt;sonar.pl &lt;&lt;____eof #!/usr/bin/perl use strict ; use warnings ;  $&lt; == 0         ||      die "$0: should be run as root" ;  my $host = `hostname` ; chomp ($host)  ;  # the targetted tcpdump buffered my $command = "tcpdump -i en1 -l -n -q \'dst host " . $host . " and ( icmp[icmptype] != icmp-echoreply )\' 2&gt;/dev/null" ;  sub bing {         printf ("^G") ; # ^G == a real ctl-G }  open (PIPE, "$command |")       ||      die "couldn't start pipe: $! $?" ;  # print without buffering $| = 1 ;  while (my $line = &lt;PIPE&gt;) {         bing() ; }  close (PIPE)    ||      die "couldn't close pipe: $! $?" ; ____eof $ chmod u+x sonar.pl /code/pre  <comment100253> Just be sure to rate limit the notifications since ping floods can send thousands of packets a second and you'll want your notification system to scale and fail gracefully. <comment100260> Thanks for the tip... but how do I get the notifications? <comment100266> I would probably have a pair of shell scripts. One running tcpdump and grepping for "ICMP echo request" and writing to a pipe and another script reading from the pipe and doing the rate limiting and calling [terminal-notifier](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/61943/is-there-a-way-to-add-items-to-notification-center-through-terminal-or-other-mea). However, I've done a fair amount of shell scripting, so you might not want this implementation if you're not handy with light scripting tools and syntax. <comment100281> Try the http://www.zonealarm.com/security/en-us/zonealarm-pc-security-free-firewall.htm  I did not ry it my self, but that might work for you and it is free. <comment100286> @Borderline ... No mac version of that software...
