Extract photo from Live Photo <body> I recently backed up all my iPhone 6s photos to my media server (running Linux).  All of the Live Photo files are in a ".mov" format.  They play fine as videos, but I'd like to extract the high quality photo from each file.  I tried inspecting the file with codeffprobe/code but that didn't give me much to go on  precodeInput #0, mov,mp4,m4a,3gp,3g2,mj2, from 'IMG_1419.MOV':   Metadata:     major_brand     : qt     minor_version   : 0     compatible_brands: qt     creation_time   : 2016-02-10 22:27:35   Duration: 00:00:01.47, start: 0.000000, bitrate: 9355 kb/s     Stream #0:0(und): Video: h264 (High) (avc1 / 0x31637661), yuvj420p(pc, smpte170m/bt709/bt709), 1440x1080, 8637 kb/s, 11.59 fps, 15 tbr, 600 tbn, 1200 tbc (default)     Metadata:       creation_time   : 2016-02-10 22:27:35       handler_name    : Core Media Data Handler       encoder         : H.264     Stream #0:1(und): Audio: pcm_s16le (lpcm / 0x6D63706C), 44100 Hz, 1 channels, s16, 705 kb/s (default)     Metadata:       creation_time   : 2016-02-10 22:27:35       handler_name    : Core Media Data Handler     Stream #0:2(und): Data: none (mebx / 0x7862656D), 43 kb/s (default)     Metadata:       creation_time   : 2016-02-10 22:27:35       handler_name    : Core Media Data Handler Unsupported codec with id 0 for input stream 2 /code/pre  Is it possible for me to extract the photo on Windows or Linux?  <answer228398> The photo isn't stored within the video. The phone creates a photo and video separately which can be pulled separately off the device using Image Capture's equivalent on Windows or Linux.
