Creating a Mac app bundle <body> I'm trying to create a Mac app bundle,  So I did this,  precodemkdir -p android.app/Contents/MacOS/ cp /path/to/myscript.sh android.app/Contents/MacOS/android chmod +x android.app/Contents/MacOS/android SetFile -t APPL android.app/Contents/MacOS/android /code/pre  But when I do codeopen android.app/code, it prompts me codeThe application cannot be opened because its executable is missing./code  That's totally weird. Anyone know how to fix that?  Running Mac OS 10.11.4  <answer236333> App bundles must contain certain files as documented in Apple's Bundle Programming Guide  The required files are  ul liInfo.plist file - The information property list file is a structured file that contains configuration information for the application. The system relies on the presence of this file to identify relevant information about your application and any related files./li liExecutable/li /ul  So you need an Info.plist  <comment289200> Mac app bundles are mysterious and weird.
