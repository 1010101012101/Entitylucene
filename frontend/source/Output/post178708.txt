Data spread on two disk, but only one Time Machine backup <body> ul liI have an MBA with 500GB SSD;/li liHowever I have 850GB of data;/li liI would like to split the data to something like 300GB in the SSD and 550GB in an external drive;/li liAnd I would like to have strongone/strong Time Machine backup.../li /ul  Is that possible?  The idea would be to have the important data (like all the documents) in the internal SSD drive, and from time to time, when needed, connect the external drive with the less "critical" data (like pictures and music). And what I would like is that when I connected mentioned external drive, I also connect a second external drive to do the backup (Time Machine) of the two drives containing the data. Is that possible?  I know it is possible to split the data by using symlinks, and as a matter of fact I stumbled upon the following stackexchange article which talks about this, but only for the data split, not the Time Machine backup part. Moreover, the article is a bit old (2011) and I wonder up to which point it is still valid/up-to-date: One mac, Two or more storage devices - how to divide things?
