Is there a GUI for OS X LaunchAgents? <body> I'm a web developer by day and a lot of the software I install on my computer (namely databases and web servers) come with an optional LaunchAgent to automate starting/stopping processes on boot. I'm wondering if there's a GUI for these types of services so I can use the LaunchAgent, then kill the services gracefully. Another great feature would be if I could turn off boot on launch and just use the LaunchAgent to start/stop a service as needed.  <answer19744> launchAgents are there to run in the background in conjunction with their respective Daemon, i.e. they have no GUI but you can load &amp; unload them using terminal using:  precodelaunchctl unload -S Aqua /Library/launchAgents/"launchAgent's name" /code/pre  "lanuchAgent's name" : enter the file name of the Agent you want to load/unload. /Library/launchAgents in OS X that is the default folder for Agents to load just replace unload with load  <answer19757> Lingon (MAS link)  It provides a nice GUI for creating daemons/agents, without writing plist file by yourself. You can also use it to delete daemons/agents that you don't want.  <answer94078> This seems to be exactly what you are looking for: LaunchControl  <answer161399> I found this article: https://foliovision.com/2014/01/os-x-scheduling-tools  Lingon looked very slick.  <comment21685> If in /Library they will probably need to run with sudo <comment21686> if you are logged in as a privileged user you don't need to, you need to use sudo if you want to un/load the daemon <comment21694> But I don't think it stops and starts processes - see its suggestion to logout/reboot after making a change <comment21762> It won't load and unload the jobs - but you can easily do that from terminal by dragging the name of the agent from Lingon to the terminal. The start launchctl command is also nice for testing. <comment21763> Try booting in single user mode some time and firing up jobs by hand using launchctl. It's so much nicer than the old days and you can really learn how things work. <comment21806> The OP seems to be looking specifically for GUI to control loading and unloading - not how launchd works in the command line. Good information, but not relevant to this topic. <comment111494> Nice one. This seems to map directly to how `launchd` works. Compare the dropdown in the upper left of the GUI to the list of file locations in the [docs](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/darwin/reference/manpages/man8/launchd.8.html). <comment154551> You wont need root for `LaunchAgents`. They run as unprivileged user! <comment188611> Lingon is awesome. Been a great program for many years now.
