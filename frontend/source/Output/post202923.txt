How much free space does fsck need to rebuild the catalog file? <body> I am in single-user mode, running codefsck -fy/code.  It attempts to rebuild the catalog file and exits with a status of code-34/code, complaining of a codedisk full error/code.  How much free space does the disk need to have for codefsck/code to do its work?  Right now it has over 150 GB free, which is about 25% of the disk.  <answer202925> To rebuild the catalog you need continuous space. Obviously, you do not have enough.
