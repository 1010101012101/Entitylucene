Install xquartz using homebrew on Mac OS X El Capitan <body> I installed xquartz in Mac OS X El Captain using the following command:  precodebrew install Caskroom/cask/xquartz /code/pre  After completion, codebrew list/code does not show xquartz. Am I doing something wrong here?  <answer224968> No - you shouldn't expect to see a cask when you type codebrew list/code - instead use codebrew cask list/code to check for XQuartz and other cask-only installs.  <comment272125> Isn't the program installed as XQuartz? Spotlight should find it but maybe that's not what you are trying to do? Also, `brew cask list` should list the casks you've tapped so maybe its just that? <comment272924> oh! ok. `brew cask list` shows xquartz but not `brew list`!
