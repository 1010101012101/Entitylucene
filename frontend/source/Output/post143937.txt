iTerm2: Saving Global Shortcut Keys <body> In iTerm2, I can define code"Global Shortcut Keys"/code, which is great. I can also code"Load Presets"/code within this view. But how can I save code"Global Shortcut Keys"/code?   I don't see an option to do this anywhere:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/awSlR.png" alt="enter image description here".  <answer143945> You can save different settings by going to the Profile Tab and creating a new Profile. It will have a tab at the right for setting key settings, and you can select/deselect that profile to enable your customized tabs.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WUYGC.png" alt="enter image description here"  If you want/need to edit the mappings en-masse, there is a file called codePresetKeyMappings.plist/code inside the Resources folder in the app. (Right click on app, choose "Show Package Contents".)  Within the Profiles tab, there is also a pop-up menu at the bottom for bulk copying presets from a given profile. (Selected in the image...)  <comment170175> Thanks. Once I do that, where can I find my profile in disk to make a backup copy? (in case my computer crashes)
