Fast CD ripping on old MacBook Pro, slow ripping on i5 PC? <body> I'm ripping my entire music collection into ALAC, as it's the best solution for quality and compatibility across all devices in our household. In order to speed the ripping process up, I have iTunes installed on my PC and Apple laptop with the same ripping settings (ALAC, error correction enabled), with the aim to merge the two local libraries later. The issue I have is, the Windows PC is extremely slow compared to the laptop, despite having the power advantage.  Any ideas what could be causing this? I the DVD-RW drive in the PC (Samsung SH-224DB) is capable of reading at 40x but it's clearly not even close. From what I have read, the SuperDrive in my laptop is only 20x~.  I'm almost tempted to convert the computer into a temporary 'Hackintosh' to see if there is any difference.  Screenshots of ripping progress  <answer115621> Installed Mavericks on the same, slow ripping PC onto a USB external drive. After adjusting one or two kexts, I had a mostly functional OS X environment.  Updated and ran iTunes with the same settings. Ripping is now mostly at 20x on the same CD drive. Looks to be a limitation with iTunes for Windows, or Windows itself. Who knows!  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/L8mG3.jpg" alt="Ripping on 10.9 Hackintosh"
