How can I config an email account in Apple Mail with my own domain? <body> I am using outlook.com for my own email "mydomain.info" but I can not add an account in Apple Mail. I have searched in Ask Different for similar questions. I got this:  Personal domain email using Outlook.com on Apple Mail  I have exact the same problem but the accepted answer doesn't work for me. My domain is "domain.info". I never configured an account successfully in Apple Mail from Maverick to Yosemite and now El Capitan.  <answer214547> Since you don't provide any more info about your email service, you must do some of the next:  ul liGo to your TLD admin panel, must of them already have documentation about how to configure this./li liCan you access it via web? something like emwebmail.MyDomain.info/em? if so, there could be some documentation in there too./li lihave you already tried adding your account via/li /ul  Settings  Internet Accounts  Add ( + button)  Add Other Account...  Most of the times this should work
