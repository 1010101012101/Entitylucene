How to stop being logged out of SSH sessions when locking the screen in OS X 10.9.1? <body> Every time I lock my screen I get logged out of any active SSH sessions.  I've added the following to my ~/.ssh/config file, but I still get logged out:  precodeHost *   ServerAliveInterval 60 /code/pre  How can I stop being logged out of SSH sessions when I lock my screen?  <answer119741> Two methods…  ul liAdd the following to code/etc/ssh_config/code:  precodeTCPKeepAlive yes /code/pre/li liUse codescreen/code:  ol liCreate a new screen with codescreen/code, then use the terminal normally./li liWhen the connection breaks, reconnect normally./li liRun codescreen -dr/code to reattach./li /ol/li /ul  <answer119920> It really depends on what is logging you out. Assuming that this is not an issue of changing Power settings (i.e. your machine is not sleeping), then most things that will break the connection can be solved by using a program called codeautossh/code.  It's a wrapper around the regular codessh/code program (which it uses) and it implements a more robust keep-alive mechanism.  I got mine from MacPorts, but I'm sure Fink has a port, too.  <answer125865> Install an app called "Lock Me Now" from the app store and once it has been installed launch it and from the preferences "check" "Just Lock" under "Lock Type" which does the same thing as the screen saver timing out. Also for ease of use you can assign a keyboard shortcut to simplify the process of locking your Mac (I chose to use Command + L )  <comment139689> I've used screen on the remote end to isolate myself from network interruptions. Does the TCPKeepAlive client setting prevent the remote server from disconnecting idle connections? My guess is a large fraction of ssh terminations are server side idle detections. <comment139690> @bmike Not really sure — I've always used screen myself too (as I can resume from different computers), but a cursory Googling gave me [TCPKeepAlive](http://tldp.org/HOWTO/TCP-Keepalive-HOWTO/overview.html). <comment139956> Doh. I think I was putting my mac to sleep because it's a macbook pro and there's no eject key. I'd read that was the button at the top right, but I think on newer macs it's just the power button. <comment313314> As of Sep 2016 there is no such app in the Mac app store.
