View all a fonts characters app? <body> Is there a Mac app for viewing all the characters of a font?   Font book doesn't seem have this feature.  <answer34243> Font Book does in fact have a view that displays all glyphs provided by a font &mdash; just select emPreview - Repertoire/em on the menu bar:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IMS5A.png" alt="Fontbook preview all glyphs"  You can also get a preview of a font using Quick Look: select a font file (from /Library/Fonts) and press kbdspace/kbd.  <answer34248> Alternatively in System Preferences - International in the Input Menu tab there is an option to place a Character Palette on the menu bar that can (among other things) show you all the glyphs in a particular font, what the glyph is called and allow you to insert the character into a document or text field.  <answer34374> I guess you're on Lion - right ?    Because in Snow-Leopard you could get that by showing the "character viewer" from the inputs menu or launching directly code/System/Library/Input Methods/CharacterPalette.app/code as described here and choosing "Glyph" view.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nDlC2.png" alt="character viewer"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZnAWM.png" alt="glyph view"  Check out the new smilies (now part of the Unicode standard ;) in the DejaVu font    But if you still got access to a strongSnow-Leopard/strong installation you can copy the CharacterPalette.app from code/System/Library/Input Methods/CharacterPalette.app/code and it will run on Lion, I would not recommend replacing the Lion version, but rather keeping the Snow-Leopard CharacterPalette as separate app - why did Apple have to make it worse in the first place ?!    As you can drag &amp; drop glyphs from the Snow-Leopard Character Palette but not from the new Lion Font Book...    This idea was inspired by Is it possible to use the character map as a standalone app?  <answer167153> I use character maps heavily and decides to make one which you access from anywhere using a web interface and requires no installation.  strongFeatures/strong  ul liSelect your own font file/li liProvides font and character information/li liCharacter copy-able/li liSupports TTF/OTF/li liSupports Icon fonts/li liSmooth interface/li liNo installation necessary/li liNo server upload necessary/li /ul  strongScreenshot/strong  img src="https://i.imgur.com/mW5uQAH.jpg" alt="Imgur"  <comment39070> ace ! cheers Graeme... <comment39082> In 10.7 Lion what you suggest is no longer possible in Character Viewer. <comment39126> @NathanGreenstein thanks for the image edit. <comment39129> Not mine, thank @Lri :) <comment39241> Which annoyed my so much (!) that I copied the SnowLeopard "Character Viewer" from /System/Library/Input Methods/CharacterPalette.app to my new Lion installation (not as replacement, but as separate standalone app) - and guess what: it works ! I was so happy :D - The idea was inspired by http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/20165/is-it-possible-to-use-the-character-map-as-a-standalone-app <comment39292> Well, crap -- I like the Character Viewer. Thanks for the update. <comment66884> Unfortunately, Apple broke this dialog in Lion like you said … it’s almost completely useless now. <comment169695> FWIW this still works in OSX Yosemite 10.10 <comment283605> And El Capitan 10.11
