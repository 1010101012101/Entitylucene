How many tries on iTunes Security Questions <body> I folgot the answer to one of my security questions and now, for the first time in years, I need to answer them to buy music from my iPod.  Now, I know I can change my questions, but I would really like to know what I thought was my dream job a couple years ago, so I'd like to try out a few things.  The question is: Are there going to be any negative consequences when I enter wrong answers, like waiting to try again or even a blocked account, and if so, how many attempts do I get before anything happens?  Thanks in advance for any answers.  <comment119289> YES, the negative consequence is: you account will be locked for 24 hours before you can try again.
