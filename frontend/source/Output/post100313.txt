Strange behavior of keyboard shortcuts <body> On my imac I have system Preferences - hardware - keyboard - keyboard &amp; text input set with a checkmark for move focus to menu bar with ^F2.  It works.  On my (pretty new) macbook air, I set the same thing, and it doesn't work.  I have (Text boxes and lists only ) checked on both machines, but I seem to get the same result with all controls checked..  Both are os x version 10.8.4  --  On the other hand, Under mission control, when switching to an application, switch to a space with open windows for the application WORKS for macbook air, but not for the iMac.  What am I missing?  Anyone else have these kinds of problems?  <answer100349> Do you have this setting enabled?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mfWs2.png" alt=""  If you don't, you can still use fn-control-F2 to move focus to the menu bar.
