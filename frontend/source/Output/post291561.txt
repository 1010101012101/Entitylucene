Hardware problem, graphic card cannot be initialized after 10.12.6 update <body> I updated my iMac to 10.12.6. As soon as iMac restarted after the update was finished, the screen went off.  I tried to connect it from another mac using screen-share, and I was successful. I noticed that system is running normally except for the screen which is off. Using screen-share, I can access internet, connect bluetooth devices, print… etc, but the screen is off.  System report shows me strong"No information found."/strong under strongGraphic/Display/strong.  I can't run system restore, because screen never goes on during the boot cycle.  Any help would be greatly appreciated!  h2Hardware Overview/h2  ul liModel Name: iMac/li liModel Identifier: iMac12,2/li liProcessor Name: Intel Core i5/li liProcessor Speed: 3.1 GHz/li liNumber of Processors: 1/li liTotal Number of Cores: 4/li liL2 Cache (per Core): 256 KB/li liL3 Cache: 6 MB/li liMemory: 8 GB/li /ul
