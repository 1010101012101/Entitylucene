Mid 2011 iMac - Upgraded RAM (32GB) never goes above 7GB of Used Memory (still laggy, crashy) <body> I've got a mid 2011 iMac (27").  Originally, I had 1TB HDD and 8GB of RAM. Over the last few months, it's been getting progressively slower and buggier (lagging, app crashes, etc). So, I upgraded to the following:  4.0TB Desktop SSHD Solid State Hybrid Drive (by Seagate, from MacSales)  32.0GB (8GB x 4) PC3-10600 DDR3 1333MHz SO-DIMM 204 Pin CL9 SO-DIMM Memory Upgrade Modules (by OWM, from MacSales)  emNote: While Apple states that the mid 2011 iMac can take a maximum of 16GB, it is well documented in many places that 32GB works fine./em  strongemMy current stats are now:/em/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZmbaO.png" alt="Current Mac"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CFMdQ.png" alt="Current HD"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Vl7do.png" alt="Current RAM"  Using BlackMagic Speed Test before and after, I get the following (using 5GB stress):  emBefore/em  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/53fo8.png" alt="Speed before"  emAfter/em  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PSAWD.png" alt="Speed after"  As you can see in the speed tests, there is some improvement with the disk speed. And the new drive is leaps and bounds faster on boot-up (after much headache).  strongemSo, My Problem Is.../em/strong  The problem I'm having is that the codeMemory Used/code emnever/em goes above 7GB. Before the upgrades, the used memory floated around 6.5GB, but even after the upgrade the numbers remain the same.  Regardless of whether I'm loading a bunch of "expensive" windows in a web browser (i.e. all filled with multiple high-res GIFs), or load a 15,000-line script into Brackets, the memory used hangs down below 7GB. The "browser with GIFs stress-test" will quickly cause the browser to crash (Safari, Chrome, it doesn't matter). And Brackets is notorious on my system for hanging and lagging with files greater than a couple thousand lines - this is why I upgraded in the first place!  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NCBS8.png" alt="Brackets Lag"  The screenshot above was taken while Brackets was trying to open multiple of the Brackets source files (i.e. main.js, third party.min.js). The same memory consumption is seen when trying to open source files in Brackets' dev tools. At the time of the screenshot, Brackets was unresponsive to any input until the files finished loading.  After loading, when trying to scroll these large files, it continues to be very laggy, completing the scroll no less than 5 seconds after I have stopped scrolling on the mouse.  So what gives? I am not a hardware guru, but it seems to me that if more memory is available, the system should be able to use it improve the user experience.  Is there a global setting I need to change, to allow access to all the RAM? Or am I stuck in this laggy, crashy purgatory until I can come up with the small fortune to upgrade to a new system? I don't expect brand-new 2016 Mac Pro speeds, but there is hardly any improvement (if at all). How do I let resource-heavy apps consume more memory?  strongEdit #1 - More Info/strong  Looking at the CPU usage, it shows "Brackets Helper" consuming a huge amount of CPU when this is all happening. Loading the files consumes more than 100% CPU (111%), and scrolling through them while highlighting text hovers around 70%.  So I might be out of luck if it's the i5 causing all these problems.   Still! Any thoughts or suggestions are still welcome! I'm trying to figure out how to run Brackets (and cache, and Brackets Helper) from a Ramdisk - if that'll help at all.  I dunno.  strongEdit #2 - Apple Hardware Test/strong   Per the suggestions in the comments, I ran Apple's Hardware Test (Option+D on boot-up). Only ran the Basic Test.  The results were:  precodeError: 4MOT/4/40000003:HDD-1355 /code/pre  I had this exact same error when I ran the Apple Hardware Test before upgrading the HDD and RAM. According to this post, it is the GPU.  I contacted Apple Support (online chat), which was ultimately a waste of time. Won't tell me anything without physically bringing it in to an Apple Store. According to this post, I can upgrade from the stock codeRadeon HD 6770M 512Mb/code to codeRadeon HD 6970M 2Gb/code, so I'll likely give that a shot.  But still nothing to facilitate the system using all the available ram. Is it maybe because the CPU can't handle that much (codeIntel Core i5 2.7GHz/code)? I'm looking into upgrading to the CPU to i7; the documentation of successful upgrades is hit-and-miss, but I'm sure there's a way.  If it isn't the CPU, any other thoughts?  <comment323325> Have you tried running [Apple Hardware Test (AHT)](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201257).  Hold the D key while booting from a powered off state with the AC adapter connected. <comment323352> If Allan's suggestion doesn't work (i.e. You can't run AHT), then try holding both the Option and D keys during startup instead. This will try to run AHT via the internet. <comment323421> Updated question, please see **Edit #2**.
