I'm log until ca. 15min and I get this only one line for today: charles   ttys000                   Tue Dec 24 11:27   still logged in. The date command prints "Tue Dec 24 11:27:02 CET 2013". <comment134523> @charles could you please explain what you are exactly trying to accomplish? It's not quite clear from your question as it's very brief. <comment134691> I want to track how long I worked every day. e.g. [08:05] Login, [12:20] Logout (launch) [13:35] Login, [19:05] Logout (back at home). <comment134748> Actually I would like to also track locked screen.
