How to get rid of Applescript confirmation? <body> I am an OS X strongnovice/strong.  I have an Applescript set to run at boot and instead of running automatically, I have to trigger the script with a run confirmation:  precode"Press Run to run this script, or Quit to quit" /code/pre  How do I get rid of this so the application runs seamlessly?  The following file was saved as an application.  precodetell application "Finder"     activate     tell application "Finder" to set pathToSound to (((path to me) &amp; "Contents:Resources:TardisTakeoff.m4a") as string) as alias      tell application "QuickTime Player" to play (open pathToSound) end tell  tell application "System Events"     key code 107 end tell delay (0.1) tell application "System Events"     key code 107 end tell delay (0.1) tell application "System Events"     key code 107 end tell delay (0.1) tell application "System Events"     key code 107 end tell delay (0.1) tell application "System Events"     key code 107 end tell delay (0.1) tell application "System Events"     key code 107 end tell delay (0.1) tell application "System Events"     key code 107 end tell delay (0.1) tell application "System Events"     key code 107 end tell delay (0.1) tell application "System Events"     key code 107 end tell delay (0.1) tell application "System Events"     key code 107 end tell delay (0.1) tell application "System Events"     key code 113 end tell delay (0.1) tell application "System Events"     key code 113 end tell delay (0.1) tell application "System Events"     key code 113 end tell delay (0.1) tell application "System Events"     key code 113 end tell delay (0.1) tell application "System Events"     key code 113 end tell delay (0.1) tell application "System Events"     key code 113 end tell delay (0.1) tell application "System Events"     key code 113 end tell delay (0.1) tell application "System Events"     key code 113 end tell delay (0.1) tell application "System Events"     key code 113 end tell delay (0.1) tell application "System Events"     key code 113 end tell delay (0.1) tell application "System Events"     key code 107 end tell delay (0.1) tell application "System Events"     key code 107 end tell delay (0.1) tell application "System Events"     key code 107 end tell delay (0.1) tell application "System Events"     key code 107 end tell delay (0.1) tell application "System Events"     key code 107 end tell delay (0.1) tell application "System Events"     key code 107 end tell delay (0.1) tell application "System Events"     key code 107 end tell delay (0.1) tell application "System Events"     key code 107 end tell delay (0.1) tell application "System Events"     key code 107 end tell delay (0.1) tell application "System Events"     key code 107 end tell delay (0.1) tell application "System Events"     key code 113 end tell delay (0.1) tell application "System Events"     key code 113 end tell delay (0.1) tell application "System Events"     key code 113 end tell delay (0.1) tell application "System Events"     key code 113 end tell delay (0.1) tell application "System Events"     key code 113 end tell delay (0.1) tell application "System Events"     key code 113 end tell delay (0.1) tell application "System Events"     key code 113 end tell delay (0.1) tell application "System Events"     key code 113 end tell delay (0.1) tell application "System Events"     key code 113 end tell delay (0.1) tell application "System Events"     key code 113 end tell delay (0.1) tell application "System Events"     key code 107 end tell delay (0.1) tell application "System Events"     key code 107 end tell delay (0.1) tell application "System Events"     key code 107 end tell delay (0.1) tell application "System Events"     key code 107 end tell delay (0.1) tell application "System Events"     key code 107 end tell delay (0.1) tell application "System Events"     key code 107 end tell delay (0.1) tell application "System Events"     key code 107 end tell delay (0.1) tell application "System Events"     key code 107 end tell delay (0.1) tell application "System Events"     key code 107 end tell delay (0.1) tell application "System Events"     key code 107 end tell delay (0.1) tell application "System Events"     key code 113 end tell delay (0.1) tell application "System Events"     key code 113 end tell delay (0.1) tell application "System Events"     key code 113 end tell delay (0.1) tell application "System Events"     key code 113 end tell delay (0.1) tell application "System Events"     key code 113 end tell delay (0.1) tell application "System Events"     key code 113 end tell delay (0.1) tell application "System Events"     key code 113 end tell delay (0.1) tell application "System Events"     key code 113 end tell delay (0.1) tell application "System Events"     key code 113 end tell delay (0.1) tell application "System Events"     key code 113 end tell delay (0.1)  quit me /code/pre  <answer245801> Open up your script in Script Editor. Do a Save As... (hold Option key down and "Duplicate" in File menu will change to "Save As...").  When you save your script as an application this time, make sure the box that says "Show Startup Screen" is not checked. See my screenshot.  That's all there is to it. Your old script was saved with the "Show startup screen" option checked. Now you know what that option does!  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pcAvM.png" alt="AppleScript save as application without Startup Screen"  <answer245827> This is not meant to be an answer to your question, it's an example of how to improve your emcode/em.  After reviewing your emcode/em, the 240 lines of emcode/em surrounding emSystem Events key code/em and emdelay/em can be condensed into 14 lines of emcode/em using 3 emrepeat/em statements in total. Setup a emrepeat 10 times/em statement for each emkey code/em and a emrepeat 3 times/em statement surrounding it.  Example:  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"coderepeat 3 times     repeat 10 times         tell application "System Events"             key code 107         end tell         delay (0.1)     end repeat     repeat 10 times         tell application "System Events"             key code 113         end tell         delay (0.1)     end repeat end repeat /code/pre  <comment303054> It might be more helpful if you'd include the contents of the AppleScript _script_ and how you saved it, e.g, as a _script_, _application bundle_ or _application_? The latter is better for automated processes assuming you have no _code_ that requires _user input_ to run. <comment303057> How exactly do I embed such a file into my question <comment303062> You can copy and paste the _code_ from the AppleScript into your question by clicking the edit link.  After you pasted it, highlight the _code_ and press the Code sample button (the curly braces) on the toolbar.  And don't forget to state how you originally saved it, e.g, as a _script_, _application bundle_ or _application_. <comment303300> Thank you, the script was not saved as an application in itself but only part of a larger application folder. Due to your detailed answer I was able to solve the problem by opening the application. Upon seeing the startup screen, I pressed file and unchecked show startup screen. Thanks <comment369670> I wonder where that option is saved in the application package itself, that you can just change that line instead of having to duplicate the file and delete the original...
