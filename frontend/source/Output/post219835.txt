How can I show the contact number of the Dialed contact <body> I want the contact number to appear on the dialling screen when initiating call that if contact has more than one number I want to know which number I had dialled.  <answer219844> Unfortunately, you cannot display the number of a contact while calling him. However, there's a way of identifying the number you are calling by adding a custom Contact Label.  To do so:  ol liOpen Contacts app/li liSearch for you desired contact/li liTap Edit in the top right corner to edit your contact/li liTap the label next to the number on the left. (see image below)/li liChoose a label for that number (see image below)/li liDo the same for the other numbers/li /ol  Then, when you call that contact, the label will appear directly below the contact's name.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3T5Ph.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/onrCq.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment265903> @MahmoudMohammed could you please upvote my answer and mark it as the correct answer if you think it deserves it?
