Rename various folders ignoring current name with Better Finder Rename <body> I have the following folders  precodetrip to xxx folder-temp pic-temp my-xxx-videos /code/pre  I wanna rename all the folders to "my-folders1", "my-folders2" and so on.  I am using better finder rename but I don't see an option that lets me completely remove any folder name and replace it with something else. Any ideas?  I already know how the incrementing number work.  <answer117577> Maybe it's easier to open Terminal, go the the parent folder and run  precodei=0 for f in *; do     if [[ -d "$f" ]]; then         mv "$f" my-folders$i         ((i=i+1))     fi done /code/pre  <answer117719> You can 'completely remove any folder name and replace it with something else' using the strongCompletely rename/strong action, available from Advanced &amp; Special:     This feature simply renames a file to the new name specified above. This is useful in combination with the droplet feature.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FeZHa.png" width="563" title="Advanced &amp; Special â†’ Completely rename"
