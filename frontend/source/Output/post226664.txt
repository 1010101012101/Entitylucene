HP monitor not working via Thunderbolt port to HDMI <body> I have two identical HP 27vx monitors and a Mac mini.  All were new in December 2015. One monitor works fine via HDMI and the Mac mini, but the second one will not work with a Thunderbolt to HDMI cable. The same monitor and cable work on an iMac and a MacBook Air I have.   I took the mini and one monitor to the Apple Store. The mini was able to run two monitors the store had with my cables. Tried my monitor on another Mac mini in the store and it would not work. They tried a Thunderbolt to HDMI adapters the store had and it did not work either.   If the Mac mini is booted up with just the HP monitor hooked to the Thunderbolt port, the mini crashes.  Any ideas?  Note: Mac mini running OS X 10.11.3
