I rechecked my codeusername/code, codepassword/code and the rest of the settings emMULTIPLE/em times and not really sure what else to do...  Any ideas?  <answer173436> I had the same problem in Mail / OS X 10.10.2.  After long searches for an answer, strongI solved the problem simply inserting again my passoword for the SMTP account/strong.   Even though the stored password was correct, it didn't work until I inserted again the password. Go figure why it didn't work before !!  <answer208557> Updating to El Capitan, I had this same problem. When I checked my mail settings I noticed that my incoming port was changed to 143 from 993. I changed it back to 993 and turned on SSL and all worked again.   <comment204045> And by the way, can anyone explain me what exactly "MCMailErrorDomain error 1045" mean? Thanks. :-)
