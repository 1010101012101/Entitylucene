MacBook Pro - when I type 0 (zero) volume icon pops up <body> Every time I type 0 (zero), the volume icon pops up. Is there a way to fix this? I am using OS X 10.11.1.  <comment268396> From what context?  Finder is foremost or just in general?  Any pattern?  If you could include a little more info.  Also, what have you tried? (Reboot, killall Finder, etc.) <comment268412> Given that the 0 key is near the volume function keys on a standard Mac keyboard, I'd also ask if there have been any spills/accidents near the keyboard. <comment268498> Its a brand new laptop, no spill. both 'O' and ')' has the same issue. Have not installed anything yet. I think its a hardware issue.
