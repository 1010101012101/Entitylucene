Does iPhoto hang on to images when Optimise Mac Storage setting is used in Photos.app? <body> Situation:  ul liI've migrated from using emiPhoto/em to emPhotos.app/em on the Mac./li liI am using iCloud Photo Library/li liI have both a MacBook and an iPhone connected to the iCloud Photo Library/li liBoth devices have the codeOptimise [Device] Storage/code setting enabled/li /ul  I've read this page from Apple, so I know that although Finder shows both the iPhoto and Photos libraries as 'using' a similar amount of storage, they're actually sharing the same, underlying image files.  I'm also aware that after migrating from iPhoto to Photos, I can continue to use iPhoto, but any changes there will not be reflected in Photos...  strongMy question/strong originates from the point at which I turned on codeOptimise Mac Storage/code on the Mac...  The MacBook in question is low on storage, so, as I continue to add photos (for example, I've imported some from an external drive), the overall space available on the Mac's HD is being kept in check by the emoptimise/em setting.  When I originally opened Photos.app, both the iPhoto and Photos libraries, in Finder, were roughly equal at ~25 GB. After turning on the optimise setting and importing new photos into Photos.app, you can see in the image below, the Photos Library is now lower, at 17.8 GB:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/97SiE.png" alt="enter image description here"  ul liWill iPhoto hang on to the 25 GB?/li liCan iPhoto work alongside the emoptimise storage/em setting?/li liAt some point, the iCloud Photo Library optimisation may decide to move emolder/em photos off the Mac, that are in that iPhoto Library... what happens then?/li /ul  Note: the Mac in this situation belongs to my wife. I'm keeping iPhoto around for a while, during the transition (some photo books being worked on, etc.). So it's kinda academic, because sooner or later I won't need iPhoto. But I'd be interested if anyone knows how the local library works alongside iCloud Photo Library, with emoptimise/em turned on.
