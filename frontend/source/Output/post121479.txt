iOS 7: Unzipping zip files, natively <body> I'm working on an iPad app and I need to be able to download and unzip a collection of images to display. Is this possible to do natively in iOS 7? iOS 6?  <answer121481> As far as I know, you need to use third-party tools like SSZipArchive or ZipArchive in order to work with zip files.  Using SSZipArchive, the line below would unzip a zip file:  precode[SSZipArchive unzipFileAtPath:path toDestination:destination]; /code/pre  strongEdit:/strong  It turns out that in iOS 7, Apple added support to natively unzip files in iMessage and in the Mail app! Not sure if this is 100% related, but it might help. See this link for more info.  <comment141615> I should be more specific, I need a library to do this in my app. I guess I can go with ZipArchive... <comment141616> Oh, sorry I guess I misread the question. Why are you hesitant to use ZipArchive? <comment141618> The app is for work, and one of our mandates is to use as few third party tools as possible. <comment162753> Just a heads up, the link to SSZipArchive you provided is not to the latest version - use this instead https://github.com/soffes/ssziparchive <comment162943> @ecnepsnai You're right! Looked like I linked to a fork by accident. I've updated the answer with the correct link. Thanks! <comment215143> Is there any way to change the extracted file name?
