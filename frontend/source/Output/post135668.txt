Excluding Chrome's session storage from Time Machine <body> Is it advisable to exclude code~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Session\ Storage//code from Time Machine backups? It certainly sounds like a prime candidate, but I am unable to find confirmation anywhere, which surprises me given that Chrome is fairly widely used.  <answer135737> Since you're concerned about this occupying space unnecessarily, you could the exclude the folder. While you're at it, you could exclude the following folders since the rest (apart from codeSession Storage/code) are not useful to backup repeatedly/regularly either:     ~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Session Storagebr   ~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Local Storagebr   ~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Application Cache   In more recent versions of Chrome/OS X, these folders may be located in:  /Users/$USER/Library/Caches/Google/  Note that excluding codeSession Storage/code will prevent your sessions from being backed up - so you cannot restore back to older sessions from a backup.br Excluding codeLocal Storage/code will prevent restoring the storage used by some/many web sites that use local storage to store information (to support offline use or for longer term identification).  <comment160833> What's the reason you're looking at excluding this? <comment160906> @MK - I'm looking at excluding this so that it doesn't occupy a bunch of space on my Time Machine drive. [BackupLoupe](http://www.soma-zone.com/BackupLoupe/) tells me that the contents of the folder have been changing a lot, though to be fair the total size of the folder is fairly small. <comment160947> Thanks @MK. Just to be clear, there are three folders total that one might exclude here: Session Storage; Local Storage; and Application Cache--right? <comment160959> Yes, that's right. You could exclude these three folders. <comment291454> In more recent versions of Chrome/OS X, these folders may be located in  `~Users/USERNAME/Library/Caches/Google/` <comment292925> And it looks to me from `/System/Library/CoreServices/backupd.bundle/Contents/Resources/StdExclusions.plist` like `~/Library/Caches` is excluded from Time Machine backups by default.
