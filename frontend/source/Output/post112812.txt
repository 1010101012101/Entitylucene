Applescript to copy folder (and contents) to current location? <body> I am trying to create a button on my Finder toolbar powered by applescript to make a copy of a set folder (e.g. /Users/James/doc) and all files/subfolders within it to the current location in Finder.  The motivation for this is that I have a LaTeX documentation format with subfolders such as img that I normally add to every new coding project in a folder called doc, so having a button that adds this folder would save me time instead of manually copying it across each time.  My applescript skills are not very good, I have tried:  strong1)/strong  precodeset x to ((the target of the front window) as text) as alias set y to ((folder "Users/James/doc") as text) as alias  tell application "Finder"     duplicate y to x end tell /code/pre  the error I get from running this first attempt is: codeCan’t make target of window 1 of «script» into type text./code  strong2)/strong  precodetell application "Finder"     duplicate folder "Users/James/doc" to (the target of the front window) end tell /code/pre  which when run gives the error codeFinder got an error: Can’t set target of window 1 to folder "Users/James/doc"./code  (PS: I already know how to turn the applescripts into Finder buttons)  <answer112885> The following script should work:  precodeproperty y : POSIX file "/Users/James/doc" as alias  tell application "Finder"     set x to target of window 1 as alias     duplicate y to x end tell /code/pre  By setting codey/code as a property (and as an alias), the script should not break by simply renaming or moving the the folder to be copied.
