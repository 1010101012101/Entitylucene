How to open an app on login on secondary screen? <body> Several apps I use are set to "Open at Login". However, they are always opened on the primary screen, instead of the last position, which is the secondary one.br I those apps exclusively on the secondary display and it's pretty annoying to always move them there and resize because of extra space (no dock there).  How can I configure where apps will open by default?br How can I force them to keep the same size as last time they were used?  <answer115400> h2Assign to Space/h2  ol liGo to the space you want the app to open in (in your case the second space)/li liRight click your application's dock icon/li liMove your cursor to "Options" Under "Assign to" select "This Desktop"/li /ol  h2Window position and size control/h2  I Googled and found a solution for the resizing issue. em(Source)/em  strongMake your application launch via an Apple Script!/strong  ol liMake a script similar to this:  precodetell application "YOUR APPLICATION NAME"     launch end tell tell application "YOUR APPLICATION NAME"     set the bounds of the front window to {0, 22, 800, 1024} end tell /code/pre/li liSave it as "Application"/li liPut the saved application in your Launch Items instead of the program itself/li liAdditionally you may undock it with Dock Dodger to make this script run silently./li /ol  <comment135304> Thank you for the answer; the first approach works great. The second one is interesting and I'll give it a try, even though I didn't expect it to involve installing a new program :)
