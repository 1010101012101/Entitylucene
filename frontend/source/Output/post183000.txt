Sort items in folder by date...only for that folder! <body> Normally I have all my Finder sorted alphabetically but, for some folders, order by date would be better but changing order in those folder will change order for all Finder...  Is there a way to sort items in a different way only for that folder?  <answer183008> You can only specify the sort order for the top-most folder in any given view.br If you want to sort a folder in a folder to a different view, you would need to open it in a new window…  Main folder sorted by Name, sub folder by Date…  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CJc7Z.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer208365> In El Capitan they added an option to sort photos in Albums by newest or older!!   It's in menu bar under View - Sort - by name, older or newer!!  <comment218173> That's a solution, the best would be something permanent so, every time I open that folder, it's sorted as setted before. I try to leave the question open for a while... <comment218176> It is permanent - it just needs both views open at once to see it. <comment218180> It's true, but if there was a way to do that in the same window it would be better... <comment218181> If there was… but there isn't ;-) A good example would be to sort a hierarchy of folders by date then watch what happens as the last modifieds get changed over time.
