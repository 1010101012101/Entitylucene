Disable automatic switch to Bluetooth carkit on iPhone <body> Whenever my iPhone connects with the Bluetooth carkit that is integrated in my car audio system, the iPhone switches AirPlay to the carkit and thus sends all audio to the carkit instead of the iPhone speaker. However, when I'm listening to the radio, those sounds are essentially lost.   So, whenever I start the car, I have to manually switch AirPlay back from the carkit to the iPhone, to make sure I will hear text messages coming in, for example. That has become a lot easier with the advent of the Control Center in iOS 7, but I would like to disable the automatic AirPlay switch to the carkit. How do I do that on my non-jailbroken iPhone 4S running iOS 7?  <answer103057> To remove a paired device (your car BT) from Bluetooth on iOS:  ol liTouch Settings/li liTouch Bluetooth/li liEnsure Bluetooth is turned on and touch the Arrow next to the required Bluetooth device/li liTouch Forget this Device/li liTouch Forget Device/li liThe pairing has been removed/li /ol  A personal Note: Please do not text while driving!  <comment121279> Go to BT settings and disable pairing with the Car device.
