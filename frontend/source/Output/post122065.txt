Facebook messenger online status <body> I'm using strongFacebook Messenger/strong on my iPhone and it happens very often that I appear strongonline/strong to people even though my strongapp is not running and even my network connection is off/strong. I think it's some sort of a bug, moreover I have the latest version of iOS and the app. I'm wondering how to be 100% sure that the app and all its processes are not running, some sort of activity monitor.  ul liiPhone 4S/li liiOS 7.0.4 (11B554a)/li /ul  <comment142372> Do you ever kill the application, not just closing - killing? And did you ever check your active sessions on the FB site? <comment142547> I did not check thoroughly my active sessions on fb site yet whenever I was having weird online status issue, I surely was offline on desktop. All I did to kill the app was to use quick app switcher, and shutting it down by sliding its screenshot up.  There is one more uncommon thing happening. Few friends told me than a three dots icon is appearing in their chat window as if I was typing something, when I was offline for hours. That icon stayed there permanently until I logged in next time. <comment142548> Change your password and kill all sessions. <comment143405> Have you tried turning off push notifications for that device on iOS (or just that app on that device)? It might be that Facebook assumes you are receiving push notifications so you will be online since their servers are online all the time and can push a notification to you? If your device doesn't receive push notifications after a while, then the servers send feedback that you are not online and that might change your status for that device.
