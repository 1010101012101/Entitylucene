Manually retrieve video from an in-app recording. (5th Gen iPod) <body> Is it possible to retrieve a recorded video that is stored in-app?   The video can't be accessed anywhere else on the iPod (as far as I'm aware) - I only know that it is data under Applications.   This app has been specially designed for business purposes - however the tech support at this small company have been far from helpful.   If anyone can offer any suggestions, I'd be very grateful.  <answer111752> If the App support this feature You can copy the video from iTunes else you have to use third party applications like PhoneView or iFunBox  Using iTunes:  ol liOpen the iTunes/li liConnect the device/li liselect the device from sidebar or device menu/li liSelect the Apps tab on device window (right side column)/li liScroll down, below the apps list there will be another list of app/li liSearch for the your app in that list (if the app support shared folder it will be listed here) and select./li liOn right side the shared document for that app will be listed from there You can select and save the video./li /ol  Using Other App (PhoneView or iFunbox)  ol liDownload and install the app from the links above /li liConnect the device and open the utility (PhoneView or iFunbox)/li liSelect The device from the left side bar/li liDouble click to list the user application/li liSearch for your screen recorder app and double click on it to show the content/li liInside the app there will be a document folder./li liThere you can see your video. just drag the file to desktop or you can export the file to some other location from the menu./li /ol
