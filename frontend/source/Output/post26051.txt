Applications gone from Dock. How to restore? <body> Somehow the Applications icon is gone from my Dock. However I can't just drag the Applications folder (from Finder) into the Dock. How else can I restore it?  Is there a config file somewhere for the Dock that I can just edit with vi and fix this?  Thanks.  <answer26052> Use Spotlight to open Applications. After applications are opened, drag and drop the application you want to dock.  <answer26053> Hmm, depending on how precisely you formulated the question there are several possible answers:  ol liThe Applications folder is missing from the Dock  ul liNavigate to Computer in Finder (Shift-Command-C)/li liOpen local hard drive (usually called "Macintosh HD" or computername)/li liDrag the Applications folder to the Dock em(near the end where the other folders and the trash are located)/em/li liRight-click the folder in the Dock and select show as folder/li /ul/li liThe Applications folder/link is missing from the Favorites list in any Finder window  ul liStep 1 and 2 as above/li liDrag the Applications folder to the Favorites list /li /ul/li liYou are actually missing the Launchpad icon from the Dock  ul liStep 1 and 2 as above/li liOpen the Applications folder/li liLocate Launchpad and drag it to the Dock (near the beginning this time)/li /ul/li /ol  <answer26054> You can find the strongApplications/strong folder by clicking on the Finder icon in the Dock.

You cannot put a folder in the main applications section of the dock.  When you drop it on the dock, it will not immediately allow you to add a new item - it will instead attempt to let you drop it onto something on the dock. You may need to hold it in between two icons for a second or so before the icons slide to the side, then you can drop it on the dock.  Alternatively, you can type this into a shell to reset the dock to the default state:  precodedefaults delete com.apple.dock; killall Dock /code/pre  It will also reset a few other settings. See codedefaults read com.apple.dock/code to see what will be deleted.  This may also work for you:  precodedefaults delete com.apple.dock persistent-apps defaults delete com.apple.dock persistent-others killall Dock /code/pre  <answer122575> Drag Launchpad.app to the Dock.  I am using Maverick 10.9.2  <comment29676> Why can't you just drag it back ? <comment29677> He wants the application folder, not a specific application. <comment29679> Check this out http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=480561 or try it: "Go to the finder and locate your Applications folder. Get Info on it (Command-I) then proceed to selecting the little folder icon on the top left. Cut (Command-x) and your original icon should be restored." <comment29680> Are you on Lion or Snow Leopard? <comment29696> If you do #1, it adds the apps folder to the Dock but the icon is wrong... the icon is the address book's. I then went into its options and selected "show as folder" and that fixed the icon. <comment29697> Snow Leopard. One has to drag it to the bottom, then select "show as folder". <comment29702> It defaults to Stack then which just shows a stack of icons of the folder content. Fixed above. <comment150952> Alernative #3 helped me. <comment192207> Is your problem fixed?  If so, please accept an answer by clicking the green check mark next to the voting icons.
