How to use multiple audio outputs (of a mac) simultaneously? <body> I have en external USB-audio device, which is great (Steinberg/Yamaha). And a bluetooth speaker and an Apple TV.  Is it possible to stream audio to ALL this devices simultaneously and synchronously ?  <answer287173> For this you can use the App "Audio MIDI Setup" in /Applications/Utilities.  When you open the app, you will see a list of all audio devices in the list to the left. With the "+" button at the bottom you can create a new strongAggregate Device/strong or a strongMulti-Output Device/strong.  The devices created there will show up as normal audio devices in the system preferences' "Sound" settings.  The Multi-Output Device seems to be what you are looking for. It will output the audio to all devices enabled in the right part of the window.  The Aggregate Device allows you to join multiple sound cards to simulate one audio device with more output channels (e.g. instead of four separate stereo outputs you would see a single 8 channel output).  <comment362795> Thanks for the answer. For now, I have made only  one test. I tried to create a multiple device with my external USB audio card, the internal speakers of my screen and a bluetooth speaker. Result: the sound is output only from the external sound card. But I do not despair, I will try again very soon and study the problem. <comment362905> This is great! Thanks, itspete, it's working very well for me. I am now playing streaming music using the Built-in Output (Yosemite) and AirPlay (Airport - home theater.) This is something I've wanted to do for some time, but didn't know it was possible. Hooray for apple.stackexchange!
