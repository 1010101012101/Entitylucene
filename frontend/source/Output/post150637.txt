Dual boot Mac - void warranty <body> For work reasons I have to dual boot windows 7 in my mac. Does doing so voids my warranty?  <answer150638> Your warranty will not be voided, as this does not violate any Apple agreements.  <comment177276> Nooooo it doesn't. They created Bootcamp for this purpose. Who told you that ? <comment177277> What about the performance factor when I run windows <comment177278> I find that an Apple computer runs Windows better than any other run-of-the-mill PC. You will get high performance. <comment177281> @jason no, I don't agree. You'll get better perf with a PC of this price. But it'll still be good <comment177445> @Thomas MacBook Air's have been called the best laptop to run windows. <comment177448> @JashJacob yeah, 2 years ago. See the `YOGA 3 Pro`... The MBA is shitty compared to it...
