Running Applescript using cron jobs not working <body> I'm new to conjobs and applescript but I have the script done correctly i believe. (any critique is welcome) I don't want to bloat my calendar with events to do this because I use my calendar for appointments and I don't need the bloat.  Here's my goal: run an apple script at 9am/5pm to enable/disable a mail account (after this works I'm going to add loging in/out of an Messenger account, first things first)  here's my script:  tell application "Mail"           set offTime to 17           set onTime to 9  precode      set dayOfWeek to weekday of (current date)       set theHour to get the (hours of (current date)) as string        if theHour ≥ onTime then                 say "email on"                 set enabled of account "MAILBOX" to true        else if theHour ≥ offTime or (dayOfWeek = Saturday or dayOfWeek = Sunday) then                 say "email Off"                 set enabled of account "MAILBOX" to false         end if /code/pre  end tell  accessing cron jobs via this  precodesudo pico /etc/crontab /code/pre  and within cron jobs i've used  precode0 9 * * * username osacript "/Documents/disablemail.scpt"  0 17 * * * username osacript "/Documents/disablemail.scpt" /code/pre  variations I've attempted (based on search engine results)  precode0 9 * * * username osacript "~/Documents/disablemail.scpt"  0 9 * * * /Documents/disablemail.scpt  0 9 * * * ~/Documents/disablemail.scpt  0 9 * * * osacript /Documents/disablemail.scpt  0 9 * * * osacript ~/Documents/disablemail.scpt /code/pre  I think that's all of them.  Any feedback/assitance appreciated, thanks!  <answer90811> Cron was replaced by launchd a while back. If you're just getting started with this project, you might want to do it in launchd.  <answer90825> The entries have to be on a single line. If you use code/etc/crontab/code, the sixth field has to be the username:  precode0 9,17 * * * yourusername osascript ~/Documents/disablemail.scpt /code/pre  You can edit the user's crontab with codecrontab -e/code (or codeEDITOR=pico crontab -e/code). The entries can't include username fields:  precode0 9,17 * * * osascript ~/Documents/disablemail.scpt /code/pre  <comment106615> In  cron ~ is not understood use thefull pathname <comment106623> But won't fix the issue <comment106637> @Mark It works for me in both the user's crontab and /etc/crontab.
