Mac Numbers - how to copy multiline text without quotes <body> When I copy a cell that has multiline content, and paste elsewhere, Numbers puts quotes around it.  How do I paste without quotes, I want to paste multiple line, as it is seen in the cell.  <answer293345> Try kbdCommand/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbdV/kbd to paste without formatting.  <comment369991> Hi guesty, welcome to Ask Different! :) Can I suggest you [edit](https://apple.stackexchange.com/posts/293240/edit) your question to clarify it somewhat? Perhaps adding a screenshot to show what you mean by *a cell that has multiline content* would be useful in ensuring you get relevant answers.
