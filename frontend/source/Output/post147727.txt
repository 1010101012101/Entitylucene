Delete a currently-open file directly in the application? <body> OS X's ability to rename or move a currently-open file right inside the application is really handy:  img src="https://i.imgur.com/8biq3uX.png" alt="enter image description here"  To take it one step further, is there a trick to actually emdelete/em the current file  inside the app also? (Obviously 'closing' the file would need to be the second half of the process.)  It would save a lot of time to not have to close the file, manually locate it in Finder, then move it to Trash - but but just delete it right there and then.  I have tried dragging the 'file' (with the file icon to the left of the file name in window title) to the Trash icon on the Dock, but that doesn't actually move it to Trash.  The best I can think of is to add code~/.Trash/code directory as an item in Finder Favorites, then change the 'Where' in the above screenshot to the created 'Trash' Favorite shortcut, followed by a kbdCmd/kbd+kbdW/kbd to close it.  It's a little clunky, but it's not bad.  So is there a nifty Automator workflow / AppleScript (which can then be easily assigned to a hotkey), to make the above process quicker? A single AppleScript that could perform both the step to move current file to 'Trash' directory and then the subsequent Cmd+W keypress after a 200ms gap e.g., would be ideal.  <answer147797> Try this strongAppleScript/strong in an Automator service (you can assign a hotkey to any service):  precodeon run     set x to path to frontmost application as string     tell application x to if exists document 1 then         try             try                 set p to path of front document -- some app use --&gt; path of document                 p             on error                 set p to file of front document -- some app use --&gt;  file of document             end try             my moveToTrash(p)             close front document         on error             my speakText("can't delete this document")         end try     else         my speakText("You have no open document in that application")     end if end run  on moveToTrash(p)     if p starts with "/" then -- some app return posix path         set tFile to p as POSIX file as alias     else -- some app return HFS path         set tFile to p as alias     end if     tell application "Finder" to delete tFile end moveToTrash  on speakText(t)     say t end speakText /code/pre  I tested the script on these applications (strong"BBEdit", "TextWrangler", "TextEdit", "Preview" "QuickTime Player", "Pages", "Numbers", "Keynote", "Automator", "AppleScript Editor", "Xcode"/strong) on Mavericks  This script will not work some non-apple applications.  To assign a keystroke combination to the newly created service:  Open the System Preferences application and navigate to the Keyboard preference pane, and select the Shortcuts tab. From the list on the left of the preference pane, select the Services category. A list of the installed services will be displayed to the right. Scroll to the last category titled General, and locate the service you just created. Double-click to the far right of the service name to activate the keystroke input field and then type the key combination you wish to assign to the service. Close the System Preferences application.  <answer147850>  I use this AppleScript:  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codetell application (path to frontmost application as text)     set f to POSIX file (path of document 1) as text     close document 1 end tell tell application "Finder" to move f to trash /code/pre  A hackier version that works with a few more applications:  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codetry     tell document 1 of application (path to frontmost application as text)         set f to path         close     end tell on error     tell application "System Events" to tell (process 1 whose frontmost is true)         value of attribute "AXDocument" of window 1         set f to do shell script "x=" &amp; quoted form of result &amp; ";x=${x/#file:\\/\\/};x=${x/#localhost/};printf ${x//%/\\\\x}"         keystroke "w" using command down     end tell end try POSIX file f tell application "Finder" to move result to trash /code/pre  <comment174317> Thanks, though I've gone with the one from ` above due to it looking like it works more universally! <comment174318> Thank you! It works perfectly so far, at least in TextEdit by my testing! I've successfully added code to the end of yours to emulate a swift `Cmd+W` after the initial step you've provided, and will edit your answer to add in that code if you don't mind.
