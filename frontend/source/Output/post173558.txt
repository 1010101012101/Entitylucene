How to disable indexing for a big Swift project? <body> I have a big Swift project. It's about 40 ViewControllers, 2 storyboards and some frameworks. When I make some changes XCode begins indexing all the project and it takes a very long time!  How can I disable indexing and compiling some unnecessary Swift files?  <comment204205> There are some big improvements for Swift builds in Swift 1.2 that'll come with XCode 6.3
