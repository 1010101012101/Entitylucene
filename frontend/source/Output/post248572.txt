"Offline mode" in iOS disabling radios <body> I want to put my iPhone on offline mode completely. That way no-one can find me using Cell Towers or GPS. I want to keep my phone on.  What is the best way for doing that?  <answer248617> Switching Airplane Mode on entirely disables the Wi-Fi, cellular and Bluetooth radios in your iPhone. To disable GPS as well, go to Settings &rarr; Privacy &rarr; Location Services and switch the toggle off.  <comment308018> Stack Exchange works best when there is one question to answer. You have 4 there, even though you only numbered the first 3. Please try to edit your post down to a single question, explain what research you have done so far & also perhaps why you are wanting to do this. See [How to Ask](http://apple.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-ask) <comment308033> Thanks for the link, I edit my question. <comment308034> You know GPS is a one-way system, like a radio station? Your phone can see where it is, but GPS can't see your phone. Cell towers, on the other hand can always be triangulated from if your phone has a voice-capable connection. Your level of "offline" really depends on whether you're trying to hide from your mom, or the FBI ;) <comment308035> This is a research and imagine that i want to hide myself from FBI :) <comment308036> voice-capable connection? What is your mean? Mean that tower-provider can find my location when i am in airplane mode or not? <comment308037> I saw some providers can change phone settings for gprs or mms or etc, So they can see your recieved gps data. am i right? <comment308038> I think you need to go & do some research, then come back when you have a single clear question, rather than one question after another. If your question is "Is my position discoverable to a third party when I have Airplane mode enabled?" then the answer is "No".
