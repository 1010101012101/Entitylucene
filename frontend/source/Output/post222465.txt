Not able to restore my 3TB fusion drive late 2013 iMac <body> Last weekend my iMac started to act in a very strange way. While I was working, my Mac was very slow and the mouse and keyboard didn't respond very well.   So I decided to reboot because having two users and switching from time to time, the memory could be the problem. But when I rebooted the other user was gone, and the Mac still was very slow. I rebooted several times and nothing changed, so I decided to try to reinstall El Capitan which was the latest version that I have - originally the Mac came with Maverick.  Then everything went wrong, the system couldn't complete the installation, I tried to erase the disk, I tried to repair the disk and several errors occurred,  To make this story short, I finally succeeded installing Maverick, but then I realized that it was installed in the 122.33 GB Apple SSD because the 3TB Fusion drive couldn't be formatted. Trying several time, the disk was finally erased and I ran several verification and repair passes and everything looks OK according to Disk Utilities.   But Mavericks is still installed in the 122.33 GB Apple SSD and it looks like the 3TB Fusion drive can't be recognized, partitioned or deleted, so I am very desperate.   Here are the screenshots:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8JfXk.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Vpvsu.png" alt="enter image description here"  I already followed this instructions here, but they didn't work. I don't recall the message but it didn't work  I hope somebody can help me, I am not under warranty and I have two Times Capsules back ups, so I don't care about the information.   <answer222470> I would suggest following the steps in the answer posted here  Most importantly: codediskutil cs create "Macintosh HD" disk0s2 disk1s2/code  Your diskutil output should look more like this with the "logical volume"  precode$ diskutil list /dev/disk0    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *121.3 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:          Apple_CoreStorage                         121.0 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Boot OS X               134.2 MB   disk0s3 /dev/disk1    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk1    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk1s1    2:          Apple_CoreStorage                         999.3 GB   disk1s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.1 MB   disk1s3 /dev/disk2    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD           *1.1 TB     disk2                                  Logical Volume on disk0s2, disk1s2                                  D11BC089-D75D-4239-AB60-4293803F5F6D                                  Unencrypted Fusion Drive /code/pre  And Core Storage list like this:  precode$ diskutil cs list CoreStorage logical volume groups (1 found) | +-- Logical Volume Group 56F5527E-528E-4FD2-A978-6BDB501423F5     =========================================================     Name:         Macintosh HD     Status:       Online     Size:         1120333864960 B (1.1 TB)     Free Space:   0 B (0 B)     |     +-&lt; Physical Volume 1CA60BDE-CFCA-414B-A429-B838AD39EA82     |   ----------------------------------------------------     |   Index:    0     |   Disk:     disk0s2     |   Status:   Online     |   Size:     120988852224 B (121.0 GB)     |     +-&lt; Physical Volume D730D88C-C673-4284-9A91-1B8E705FA5F2     |   ----------------------------------------------------     |   Index:    1     |   Disk:     disk1s2     |   Status:   Online     |   Size:     999345012736 B (999.3 GB)     |     +-&gt; Logical Volume Family B1CF5519-AC85-4259-9F1F-642EFD4D8B31         ----------------------------------------------------------         Encryption Status:       Unlocked         Encryption Type:         None         Conversion Status:       NoConversion         Conversion Direction:    -none-         Has Encrypted Extents:   No         Fully Secure:            No         Passphrase Required:     No         |         +-&gt; Logical Volume D11BC089-D75D-4239-AB60-4293803F5F6D             ---------------------------------------------------             Disk:                  disk2             Status:                Online             Size (Total):          1111826382848 B (1.1 TB)             Conversion Progress:   -none-             Revertible:            No             LV Name:               Macintosh HD             Volume Name:           Macintosh HD             Content Hint:          Apple_HFS /code/pre  <answer223238> Depending on the history of your Fusion Drive the following codediskutil list/code result:  precodediskutil list /dev/disk0    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *120.0 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI                         209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:                  Apple_HFS SSD                     119.7 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Boot OS X               134.2 MB   disk0s3 /dev/disk1    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *3.0 TB     disk1    1:                        EFI                         209.7 MB   disk1s1    2:          Apple_CoreStorage                         3.0 TB     disk1s2    3:                 Apple_Boot  Recovery HD            650.0 MB   disk1s3 /code/pre  usually indicates that the CoreStorage Logical Volume Group got corrupted or a Logical Volume is missing.

I believe there may have been a bad batch of Fusion drives. I had the same problem described with the same model. The problem is the HDD of the Fusion drive failed and it simply needs to be replaced.  AppleCare will cover this though. Take advantage of it, if you have it.  <comment269799> I already try this options but it didn't work, so my option was to delete de Core Storage, and try to start from scratch, so I did it and now I am see two drives the top one is Internal Drive Capacity 3.12 TB and the other is Macintosh HD with 3.12 TB Capacity too, but it that fine? Now I will restore all my information from my Time Machine. cross fingers <comment269944> I tried that option but it didn't work, <comment269945> Update, I still have problem, after errase de Fusion Drive and fixed it with Disk Utility, I was able to download the OS X, but when the systems tried to install, it saids "INSTALL FAILED OSX could not be installed on your computer OSX can't be installed on your computer on the disk Macintosh HD, because a recovery system can't be created.Visit www.apple.com/support/no-recovery" So I checked again the internal Drive and pop up an AFI error, please help <comment270398> @bmike I don't think the question is a complete duplicate. The problem in the linked q&a was the BootCamp install and a small EFI partition in the middle of the disk. The solution would have been much simpler here (but only if both drives aren't damaged). <comment270415> @klanomath Sounds good - let's open this up, then...
