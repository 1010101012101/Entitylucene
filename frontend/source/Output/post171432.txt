Using magic-trackpad for simple play/pause interface for movies or music <body> Backstory...my mother-in-law fell and has a spinal injury (C5), and she has no finger use, just her arms.  I want to give her some control over her iPad to play or pause movies and music.  Anyone have a script to assign the play/pause button as a single tap to the magic-trackpad?  Also, any other simple yet clever scripts for handicap use with the trackpad would be most appreciated.
