Data backup needed before Apple Store screen repair? <body> My 2016 Macbook Pro screen has vertical stripes of bad pixels and I just scheduled to take it in for repair. Do they usually just fix the screen or do they replace the entire computer? I'm curious because I really want to know the following -   Although it's advised, do I actually need to back up my data before taking the computer in for a monitor issue?  <answer283817> h2The usual procedure at a Genius Bar/h2  Apple will usually replace the display ("Display Assembly") only. You will see the items that will be replaced before a Genius in an Apple Store will let you sign to accept the repair.  h2Why you still should backup your data/h2  Yes, in case something goes wrong during the repair strongyou should still have a backup of your data/strong. In case the logic board gets damaged they will replace the display and the logic board. All other components will remain the same.  <answer283819> strongYou need to backup your data./strongbr strongPeriod./strong  There is a new adage for the digital world we live in...     "Any data which is not stored in at least three distinct locations ought to be considered temporary"   This translates to one on-site backup, e.g. Time Machine -  &amp; one off-site backup, iCloud, BackBlaze, CrashPlan etc.  The first is to cover for if you break your machine irreparably.br The second is for if the house burns down too.  Without strongboth/strong your data can be lost at the em'whim of the gods'/em... forever.  Please have a read of my somewhat tongue-in-cheek question I posted on the Ask Different Meta a while ago  strongRestore from backup?/strong
