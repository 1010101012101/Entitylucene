How to inspect HTTP requests in Safari 8 <body> I can't seem to find a way to view the raw HTTP requests sent by safari to the webserver. Does anyone know how you can do this in Safari 8.  I did manage to find some HTTP headers in the resource tab of the web inspector img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LCFX2.png" alt="enter image description here" But I want to see the raw (in plain text) HTTP request  Thanks in advance  <comment269065> is this possible with 8/9 safari? real pain to debug
