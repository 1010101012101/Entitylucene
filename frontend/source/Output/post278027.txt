Quick Look showing in other display <body> Sometimes I notice that when I have a Finder window in Display 1, invoking Quick Look on a document in that Finder window will show it on Display 2. Is there a way to fix this?  I thought that it perhaps would have something to do with the dock, but it doesn't seem like showing the dock on Display 1 causes the Quick Look window to appear on Display 1 as well.
