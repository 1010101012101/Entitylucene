MacBook Pro resolution problem (1080p) using El Capitan <body> I have a MacBook Pro Mid-2012 running OS X - El Capitan 10.11.6. In addition, I have a LG monitor 23 inches (model 23MP55). I'm using a Thunderbolt to HDMI cable to mirror (or extend) my display, but I'm getting an issue. The monitor starts to get noisy when I put a 1080p resolution. Oddly, it works fine with a low resolution like 720p.  I tested my MacBook using another operating system, and it just worked perfectly well on the highest resolution. Also, I tested my cable in another monitor, this time running OS X in my MacBook, and it worked perfectly fine. Moreover, I reseted all things that I could NVRAM, SMC, and I even reinstalled the OS X.   I think is probably a issue evolving the video card driver. Do you guys have any clue what might be? Here is a picture of my monitor with this problem.  Image: http://i.imgur.com/hGRvLBj.jpg  <comment313931> Which MBP do you have (13" or 15")?
