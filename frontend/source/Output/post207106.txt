Map screen sleep (ctrl+shift+eject) to F19 <body> How can I map screen sleep (kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbdEject/kbd) to kbdF19/kbd?  Other services I can find under keyboard shortcuts in settings but not this one.   <answer207109> As suggested out by Mateusz Szlosek, BetterTouchTool solves this for me where I very simply could set F19 to execute the Sleep Display action.  <comment249711> Have You seen www.bettertouchtool.net ? Free tool for keyboard/mouse/trackpad shortcuts. <comment249724> No I have not but I it seems to solve what I trying to do. Thanks!
