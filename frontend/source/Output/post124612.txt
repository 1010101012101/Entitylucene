Sending a PDF to iBooks (iPad) <body> How can I send a PDF to my iBooks in iPad without having to connect the iPad to my laptop using a cable?  Is this possible at all? Or do I necessarily have to use iTunes and a cable?  <answer124615> You can use  ul liMail/li liDropbox/li liGoogle Drive/li liAnd many more/li /ul  Basically you just need to be able to watch the pdf on your iPad in order to save and open it with iBooks also, you can still sync with iTunes  <comment159361> if you use icloud and have a mac and a ipad you can also simply import the pdf to ibooks on mac and icloud will do it for you <comment161969> Is using iTunes the issue or the cable? Remember you can do WiFi sync, no cable.
