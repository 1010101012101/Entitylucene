Safari not able to reproduce 8k video from youtube <body> I'm trying to see the new 8k videos on Youtube with Safari but when I choose the 8k quality I get an error: strongan error occured, please try again later./strong  An example of video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChOhcHD8fBA&amp;t  When I choose 4k works fine.   I'm using a Macbook Pro 15" with touchbar with Radeon Pro 460.  Any idea why this is happening? someone is able to see the video?  <answer279021> With Chrome you can play it. It looks like Safari is not compatible with 8k.  <comment340080> Whether it works or not is somewhat moot, if you don't have an 8k screen ;) <comment351198> I can select 8k video in Chrome, and it appears to play OK (but I don't have an 8k screen). The highest resolution Youtube shows me in Safari (`settings` - `Quality`) is 1440p. For reference, my largest screen is 2880x1800.
