Copy movies from PC to iPad keeping directory structure <body> How can i copy movies from PC to iPad keeping the directory structure for off-line usage. Either by USB or Wifi. I have a Linux and a PC box available.  I would like to provide a directory and all sub-directories and movies will be copied to the iPad.  Tried with iTunes, does not have a directory structure.   iCloud drive, i want to have the files offline, iCloud drive asks each single file to be downloaded.  Dropbox, each file has to be tagged with an offline flag. Onedrive, same like iCloud  Also there is no sync option to press or status information.   Several ftp clients, VLC, only support download of one file.  How can i get my files downloaded to my iPad for offline usage?  Thanks for your ideas and help
