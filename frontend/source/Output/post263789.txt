Trouble resetting iCloud on Device iPhone 6S <body> I set up icloud with an error in the email address. I want to change the icloud ID to my correct email but can't get any of the suggestions to work. Under settings, my icloud info is grayed out and does not contain a red delete button. I try to sign out and it won't let me without putting in my password for the nonexistent email address. What do I do now?
