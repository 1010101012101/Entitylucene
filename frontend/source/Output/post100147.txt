Difficulty setting the 'Open with app' to an alias <body> I am trying to set MacVim, installed via homebrew, to be the default HEX file editor.  I started this task by creating an alias to MacVim.app located in code/usr/local/Cellar/macvim/7.3-61/code and placing the aliased app in code/Applications/code.  This allowed me to see and open MacVim from the Application folder (more info here).    Now that the aliased app is there the "Open with app" selection via the codeRightClick/code-codeInfo/code has the aliased app greyed out.  To make matters worse it does not allow me to browse/select the real app located in code/usr/local/Cellar/code.    This doesn't seem to be asking to much here, any ideas on how to change this?  <answer100152> Not the cleanest solution, but pressing code//code while in the codeOpen With/code dialog allowed me to get to /usr/local.  Found the solution here
