Safari keeps downloading data when Gmail is open <body> If I have a visible tab (non occluded window) open on Gmail, my Safari (8.0 running on Yosemite) keeps downloading data at a rate of 1 MB/s. The same does not happen with Chrome.  I'd like to understand what this is for, and if possible, make it stop.  Some info:  ul lilogs don't show anything suspicious. /li licaches are ok/li linetwork panel of web inspector shows no activity/li lilsof output: https://gist.github.com/Agos/78fa61943af31d634a99/li /ul  <answer179016> Disabling Chat in Gmail looks like it sovled the issue for me.  <comment182674> I'm not sure why this is happening, but the MailPlane folks have apparently been dealing with it already. They have a beta that is supposed to fix it. <comment212130> I'm seeing the same thing, but my data rate is 3 MB/s down and 300 KB/s up.
