Video calls are not connecting iPhone 5s <body> My iPhone 5s is not connecting IMO, Skype, and another video call apps. Please advise me how to connect to them and use.  <comment273749> Do you have a Wi-Fi or mobile data connection? You need internet for most video call software <comment273755> Have you given those apps permission to use the camera?
