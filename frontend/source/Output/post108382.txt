Can I add 100 Phone Numbers to a Single Contact? <body> My bank insists on sending me account info SMS (texts) from ~100 different numbers. They all start the same, only the last two digits differ.  e.g.  ul li+43 664 6601301/li li+43 664 6601302/li li+43 664 6601303/li li.../li li+43 664 6601399/li /ul  Can I add all of them to a single contact? Preferably without having to type them separately.  I tried   ul li+43 664 66013/li li+43 664 66013,/li li+43 664 66013*/li li+43 664 66013#/li li+43 664 66013##/li /ul  but the iPhone doesn't recognize any for the caller id.  <answer108386> As far as I am aware there is no reference to wildcard characters in vcard.  If Mac OS or iOS supported such feature it would not be supported by other devices.  But you can add the 100 phone numbers by hand. I would recommend exporting the contact as a vcd file then add all the numbers by hand. Copy paste will be faster than writing them one by one in the Contacts app:  precodeTEL;type=WORK;type=VOICE;type=pref:+43 664 6601301 TEL;type=WORK;type=VOICE;type=pref:+43 664 6601302 TEL;type=WORK;type=VOICE;type=pref:+43 664 6601303 ... TEL;type=WORK;type=VOICE;type=pref:+43 664 6601399 /code/pre  And import it back.  <comment127082> The *-sign en #-sign could be use as part of a stored phone number. Thus they should not work as wildcards in this context. <comment127128> This worked, thanks.
