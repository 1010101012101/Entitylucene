Changing default font size in Safari using JavaScript <body> I like to decrease the zoom and the font size of Safari for a better overview, I know I can set a default zoom value, but can I set a default font size?  I'm using JavaScript at the moment but I have to do that to each tab.  precodejavascript:var p=document.getElementsByTagName('*');for(i=0;i&lt;p.length;i++){if(p[i].style.fontSize){var s=parseInt(p[i].style.fontSize.replace("px",""));}else{var s=12;}s+=2;p[i].style.fontSize=s+"px"} /code/pre  <answer252072> Your question doesn't provide a lot of detail, and it's also a little ambiguous (hence the comments you're getting).   Here is an answer assuming you're wanting to do this for your own personal web browsing, rather than as a web developer. This answer also assumes you're trying to only reduce the font size rather than the whole page.  Since there's no way to do this through Safari's preferences, you have two options open to you:  ol liUsing a custom style sheet/li liInstalling an extension/li /ol  strongStyle sheet/strong  If you know how to create your own style sheet, then follow these steps:  ol liCreate a style sheet to set your font properties/li liGo to the Safari  Preferences menu/li liSelect the Advanced tab/li liIn the Style Sheet drop-down menu, select Other.../li liNavigate to your style sheet and select it/li liExit the Safari preferences./li /ol  strongExtension/strong  There are probably many extensions that will achieve what you want. Here are the steps for one that I'm aware of:  ol liGo to: https://safari-extensions.apple.com/details/?id=com.sobolev.stylish-5555L95H45/li liInstall the Stylish extension/li liRestart Safari/li liTake note that to the left of the address bar you should now see the Stylish S button/li liGo to: https://userstyles.org/styles/68263/global-font-size/li liClick on the Install with Stylish button/li liYou've now installed this style/li /ol  Now, if you need to customise this style, do the following:  ol liclick on the Stylish S button I referred to at Step 4 above./li liClick on Manage/li liUnder the Global Font Size option click on Edit/li liThis displays the CSS code for this style. Edit it as you need./li liSave your changes/li /ol  Hope this helps.  If I've misunderstood your question, please clarify it.  <comment313531> Cmd + or - not doing what you expect? <comment313532> No, I often use theses, that increasing and decreasing the zoom but not the font size though <comment313533> should change everything; does for me. prefs/advanced - do you have any minimum font size set?
