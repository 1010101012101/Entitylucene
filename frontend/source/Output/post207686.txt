How can I stop Mac Mini from shutting off when removing an SD card? <body> I've been trying to use an SD card (a micro-sd adapter and card) in a 2011 Mac Mini. When I remove the card, the Mac completely shuts off. No dialog or kernel panic screen, just instant power off. What can I do, if anything, to figure out why this is happening and fix it? I haven't seen anything stand out relating to it in the system logs. Thanks.  <comment250570> Just a bit more info. 1. Do you boot the Mac mini with the SD card in the slot? 2. Are you ejecting it from the GUI or Terminal? 3. Does this happen with all SD cards or just the one? 4. How long ago did this start? 5. Have you had any recent hardware upgrades to your Mac mini? <comment250573> 1. I don't boot with the card in. 2. Have ejected from terminal and Finder. 3. Haven't used other cards, I will try some though. 4. Just noticed today, I can't remember the last time I used one. 5. No hardware upgrades. I wonder if it's this adapter I'm using, I'll try some other cards. Thanks! <comment250639> Just to follow up; I tried a "Maxell maxdata 8gb" card, and that can be mounted/ejected multiple times without a problem. It is slightly, but noticeably thinner than the "SanDisk microSD/microSDHC/microSDXC" adapter I'm having trouble with. This adapter seems just thick enough that when removing it from the mini's card slot, it pushes on something/trips something internally that shuts the mini off. FWIW. <comment250753> I would suggest it's the adapter in this case causing the problem. Maybe purchasing a USB-microSD adapter instead and connecting the microSD card via an available USB port. I always try to replicate the issue with different hardware or on another computer where possible. In this case using a different SD card has proved fruitful in discovering where the cause may be.  <comment250787> @DanijelJ Thanks very much. â€“ matt
