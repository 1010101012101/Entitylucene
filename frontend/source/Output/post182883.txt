How do I restore the default Postscript printer? <body> I did a emReset printing system.../em, thinking it would remove all printers I installed. I didn't think it would remove everything, including the default Postscript printer.  strongEDIT:/strong  I'm on a MacBook Pro mid-2014, on OS X 10.10.3.  ol liI went to emPrinters &amp; Scanners/em/li liI right-click on the printer list/li liThen, I chose emReset printing system.../em/li /ol  I know I didn't delete "Postscript" itself, just the configured Postscript printer target. Still, I want to bring it back, since I didn't intend to delete it.  Here's a screenshot of the action I'm referring to, although I just found this and it's not a screenshot from my machine.   http://i.i.cbsi.com/cnwk.1d/i/tim/2011/09/14/ResetPrintSystem.png img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/73BZR.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer184657> I did it like this:  ol liGo to emPrinters &amp; Scanners/em/li liClick on "+" to add a new printer/li liClick on emIP/em ol liAddress: localhost/li liProtocol: Line Printer Daemon - LPD/li liName: PostScript/li liUse: Generic PostScript Printer/li /ol/li /ol  <comment217843> how did you do it, on what system, what model <comment217846> Postscript is not a actual printer, it is a software, and I doubt you have deleted it.
