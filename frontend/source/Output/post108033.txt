TextEdit print to pdf failure in RemoteViewServices <body> I just started getting "error while printing" printing to a pdf from textedit (i.e. Print  PDF  Save as PDF ...).  This has worked in the past (for years), though a web search indicates it's a common problem,    e.g.    https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4459650  It does not happen when printing to pdf from Safari, and also does not happen when logged in as a different user.  The console log says  precode2/11/13 1:02:32.547 PM TextEdit[95328]: *** Assertion failure in -[NSAccessoryWindow sendEvent:], /SourceCache/RemoteViewServices/RemoteViewServices-80.6/NSAccessoryWindow.m:144 2/11/13 1:02:32.548 PM TextEdit[95328]: window allowed unexpectedly /code/pre  Some of the web posts have included these suggestions, which do not work for me (nor for  the other people with the problem, generally)  ul lidelete the textedit preferences (2 files in ~/Library/Preferences)/li liclear the print cueue/li licmd-option-quit Textedit and restart the machine/li lirepair permissions and disk check/li /ul  Seems like it's an unsolved problem, so fame and glory to someone who can advise.  The machine is running 10.8.5. Nothing has been updated recently, however  I recall I was trying to look in the print options for something a few days ago.  Also curious, what is this RemoteViewServices?  Is this the API used to send our print jobs directly to an agency in Washington?  More seriously, google has multiple mentions of errors, but no explanation of what it actually is.
