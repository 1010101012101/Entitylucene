How can I store media on an external device and view it on my iPad? And what kind of media is supported? <body> How can I store media files (mostly video) on an external device and watch them on my iPad?   Which media types are supported?  And where can I purchase media files of those types?  I'm assuming I could use one of the wifi hard drives.  But I don't know what kind of media they support, and where to purchase it.  <comment369944> Welcome to Ask Different.  One question per question, please. Also hardware shopping is off topic.
