How to set noatime for startup drive in Mountain Lion? <body> I've followed instructions to set the noatime flag in Lion so I can reduce SSD usage but it isn't working for me on Mountain Lion.  I'm still seeing this after restarting:  precode$ mount | grep " / " /dev/disk0s2 on / (hfs, local, journaled) /code/pre  Has anyone got any suggestions how to mount the startup drive with mount flag noatime?  <answer58231> I was having this same problem in ML.  I followed the instructions you linked to and kept getting the same result as you.  precodeDavids-MacBook-Pro:~ davidsilver$ mount | grep " / " /dev/disk0s2 on / (hfs, local, journaled) /code/pre  However, Harald Hanche-Olsen's recommendation to run codesudo mount -vuwo noatime //code seemed to correct the problem.  precodeDavids-MacBook-Pro:~ davidsilver$ mount | grep " / " /dev/disk0s2 on / (hfs, local, journaled, noatime) /code/pre  <answer58264> Ok, I think I've got it working.  Add the file code/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.nullvision.noatime.plist/code with contents:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN"          "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt;     &lt;dict&gt;         &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;string&gt;com.nullvision.noatime&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;array&gt;             &lt;string&gt;mount&lt;/string&gt;             &lt;string&gt;-vuwo&lt;/string&gt;             &lt;string&gt;noatime&lt;/string&gt;             &lt;string&gt;/&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;/array&gt;         &lt;key&gt;RunAtLoad&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;true/&gt;     &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  Run these:  ul licodesudo chown root:wheel /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.nullvision.noatime.plist/code/li licodesudo chmod 644 /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.nullvision.noatime.plist/code/li licodesudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.nullvision.noatime.plist/code/li /ul  The permissions have to be set to that for codelaunchctl/code not to complain.  Then you've got this on restart:  precode$ mount | grep " / " /dev/disk0s2 on / (hfs, local, journaled, noatime) /code/pre  You can check if it runs by looking in the console:  precode29/07/12 2:55:45.334 PM sudo[978]:     Aram : TTY=ttys000 ; PWD=/Library/LaunchDaemons ; USER=root ; COMMAND=/bin/launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.nullvision.noatime.plist /code/pre  <answer72602> The tool Chameleon SSD Optimizer will work for this and it also enables TRIM. I did a lot of research and most were directing to TRIM Enabler. Then, I read few but VERY good news about this one and opted for it as it seemed newer, more stable and with no or fewer bugs.  I installed did it on my iMac (2,5 GHz i5, 16GB Ram, OCZ Vertex3 120GB SSD [boot disk] + original 500GB HD) running OS X 10.7.5. Although it was already a nice fast machine, this made things feel even faster. I use my iMac for photo and video editing with Adobe Packages and everything's stable with this addition.  <answer101169> I also had problems and had do to some additional steps  ul lichange the permission of /Library/LaunchDaemons to 777 /li licopy an existant plist as com.nullvision.noatime.plist/li liedit it's content as mentioned above and save it/li lichange the ownership and permission as mentioned above/li lirun launchctl as mentioned above/li lichange back the permission of /Library/LaunchDaemons to 755/li lireboot and check with mount | grep " / " /li /ul  <comment66949> What happens if you just run `sudo mount -vuwo noatime /` from the command line? It might produce an informative error message. <comment66983> Ah! It worked but as I feared the flag is reset on restart. It seems the plist isn't getting executed at startup. You can apparently check for com.nullvision in the console if it runs. <comment66995> See my answer... <comment67015> I think it's okay for you to accept your own answer. It won't give you any reputation, for obvious reason, but it marks the question as solved. <comment67026> says I have to wait till tomorrow, probably to ensure other answers are provided if the OP thinks they've got it when they don't <comment67027> it gives no error, output shows noatime is enabled but it only lasts until the next restart, so it needs to be scheduled I guess. <comment67051> Yeah, I knew it had to be scheduled. I asked because I wanted to know if it was the command that had failed. But as you found out, it was the scheduling that didn't work. <comment67053> A small note, BTW: This runs the command with the `v` flag, but that just turns on verbosity. Which is hardly useful in a `launchd`-controlled job. I don't think it will even find its way into a log file? <comment67062> Yeah it puts it in the console, see my update <comment67079> That console message is from `sudo`, run in your terminal. The output from the `mount` command run by `launchd` is what I was referring to. Does it show up too? <comment67140> I did as you said above, however I still get /dev/disk0s2 on / (hfs, local, journaled) <comment83740> It will work see my expanded answer  http://superuser.com/questions/487926/how-do-i-use-noatime-with-filevault-2-fde-on-mountain-lion/508286#508286 <comment134257> Do NOT recommend escalated privileges of 0777. Files in LaunchDaemons should never be higher than 0644. The ownership of the file (with group) would be: root:wheel (something you actually don't list, but strangely reference).
