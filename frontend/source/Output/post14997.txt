applescript (osascript) for changing Terminal.app profile <body> Is here a way to changing the Terminal.app profile from the command line?  Here is already couple of questions about changing colors, but I need change the whole profile from the "Basic" (what is my default) to "Homebrew" or "Pro" from the shell script.  Looking for only clean command-line solution (e.g. without clicks, global shotcuts etc.), so probably with osascript. Need it because want change the Terminal.app behavior when ssh-ing into another computer, e.g. font-size, encoding, colors, emulation - the whole profile - not only colors.  Like something next:  precodesome_commands_here to change the CURRENT terminal profile into another ssh user@example.com /code/pre  And no, I don't want use iTerm2. :)  Ps: ok, as the last resort, shortcuts are acceptable, but no clicks. :) :)  <answer14998> precode$function setTerm() { PROFILE=${1}; echo "tell app \"Terminal\" to set current settings of first window to settings set \"${PROFILE}\""|osascript; }; /code/pre  Source: commandlinefu.com  When you connect to a remote computer using ssh, the terminal.app settings will set according to the remote bash profile. Therefore you need to define the preferred settings on the remote machine first.  <comment16185> remote bash profile is OK. I want change the Terminal.app profile (from 'Basic' for example to 'Homebrew') **before** run my ssh command. And remote .bash_* *does not* set my local terminal settings. (Or, if yes, can you provide an example - how?) <comment16186> Hi @jm666, see whether the commandlinefu.com(http://www.commandlinefu.com/commands/view/5049/osx-script-to-change-terminal-profiles-based-on-machine-name-use-with-case-statement-parameter-matching) could help you with that. <comment16187> Man - COOL - This is what i exactly want. Thanks. :) Can you pls add the link into the body of your answer?
