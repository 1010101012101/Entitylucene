Frequently synchronizing iTunes library between Macbook and PC <body> I have about 80 GB of songs on my Macbook Pro and my PC Desktop.  I sometimes buy music during my travels and import it to my Macbook.  When I process my DJ Tracks, they're added on to my PC.  I want the ability to add songs to either my Macbook or my PC and have them synchronized with each other on all attributes in iTunes (including Rating, Comments, etc).  I need to do at least once a week.  How do I make this possible?  <comment72398> iTunes in the cloud is a possible solution. otherwise you should be migrating your iTunes library all the time.(http://www.ilounge.com/index.php/articles/comments/migrating-itunes-library-between-windows-and-mac-os-x/)
