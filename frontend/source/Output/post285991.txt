Is there a way to schedule an iOS app to open at specific times? <body> I was wondering if someone had any ideas on how (like the title says) I could schedule an app to open, say every hour. Workflow app unfortunately does not support the app I need opened.  <answer285996> This isn't possible due to iOS restrictions.  <comment362405> A little more depth would have been nice, but thanks!
