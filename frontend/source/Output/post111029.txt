VirtualBox: run OS X inside OS X <body> I am using Oracle VirtualBox to run OS X inside OS X. This entails running OS X on Mac-branded hardware so does not break any license agreements.  I am following the instructions on this site:  http://ntk.me/2012/09/07/os-x-on-os-x/  I have downloaded "Install OS X Mavericks.app" and ran the script     InstallESD.dmg.tool -B -i InstallESD.dmg -o Output.dmg   on the InstallESD.dmg file as advertised on the site.  This outputs a file, oddly called:  Output.dmg?.dmg  Not sure why the question mark followed by the .dmg is appended at the very end, but anyways, I have configured VirtualBox to boot from this file, and it seems like some progress is made, but then the kernel boot messages inside VirtualBox seem to pause indefinitely when the following lines are reached:  precodeinit probe start SMC::smcReadKeyAction ERROR OSK0 0xff(0xff) fKeyHashTable=0x0 SMC::smcReadKeyAction ERROR OSK1 0xff(0xff) fKeyHashTable=0x0 DSMOS has arrived [IOBluetoothHCIController][start] -- completed SMC::smcReadKeyAction ERROR BEMB 0xff(0xff) fKeyHashTable=0x0 /code/pre  I've been waiting 15 mnutes, the hard drive seems to be resting with infreqeuent short flashes, and the boot process seems to have halted at this step.  Why am I seeing this and how can I proceed with the installation of OS X (10.9) Mavericks?  Thanks.  <answer111131> You will probably need to pass some boot flags to the OS while it is booting.    I googled your error and came to this site.  His OS X booted with codeCPUIDMAX disabled and -x/code.  <comment130783> Happy to test.  What version of host OS X are you running? and the version of VirtualBox. <comment130853> Interesting answer. However I have searched for a place to disable CPUIDMAX in the BIOS settings which I was able to enter by pressing F2 upon starting the bootup process, but did not find the option. <comment130854> It is unclear to me where these flags should be passed, I don't see the bootup process pausing anywhere to allow me to enter these options. Anyone have any idea as to where I may set them? Thanks. <comment130856> I don't have the time to play around with your set up at the moment, but if someone has not come up with the answer for you by tomorrow, I'll update my answer with what you need.
