How to quit without saving using just the keyboard? <body> When I quit an application (e.g., Excel) with kbdCommand-Q/kbd, a dialog box pops up, asking me to select between codedon't save/code, codecancel/code and codesave/code. I can hit kbdEnter/kbd to select codesave/code, or I can navigate the mouse to codedon't save/code, but how do I get that without the mouse?  On Linux and Windows I can use kbdTab/kbd to switch between the 3 buttons.  What do I do on Mac OS X?   Excel for Mac 2011 (14.3.8)  I tried:   ul likbdTab/kbd/li likbdshift-Tab/kbd/li likbdcontrol-Tab/kbd/li likbdoption-Tab/kbd/li /ul  No go.  <answer154049> The standard shortcut for "Don't Save" in the dialog you mention is kbdcommand ⌘/kbd+kbdDelete/kbd. The old shortcut, kbdcommand ⌘/kbd+kbdD/kbd, can be restored by issuing the following command in Terminal:  codedefaults write NSGlobalDomain NSSavePanelStandardDesktopShortcutOnly -bool YES/code  and to revert back,   codedefaults write NSGlobalDomain NSSavePanelStandardDesktopShortcutOnly -bool NO/code  In Microsoft Office 2011 for Mac, kbdcommand ⌘/kbd+kbdD/kbd seems to work by default (but the standard shortcut does not).  Basically, try either kbdcommand ⌘/kbd+kbdDelete/kbd for Apple or standard applications, and kbdcommand ⌘/kbd+kbdD/kbd if that does not work.  <answer154050> Since Lion, the standard key command for Don't Save is kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd Backspace ⌫ /kbdbr Prior to that it was kbd Cmd ⌘  /kbd kbd D /kbd which some apps still respond to.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/m4VaS.png" alt="dialog"  kbd Ctrl /kbd kbd Tab /kbd  will switch between the options, which can then be actioned by hitting kbd Spacebar /kbd , strongonly if/strong you have All Controls set in System Prefs  Keyboard  Shortcuts  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Hbz3O.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z9KEz.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer154055> It's not the default behavior for tab–I read because someone at Apple felt tabbing "wasn't magical enough"–but in the strongKeyboard/strong preferences, click the strongShortcuts/strong tab. Then select strongAll controls/strong to make the Tab key behave the way you want. Or just press kbdcontrol/kbd+kbdF7/kbd to toggle this.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pzs7v.png" alt="because apple hates disabled people"  If you are at the following dialog, just hit kbdd/kbd...no key-combo necessary. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/m4VaS.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment181284> old shortcut? Cmd/D has been standard for as long as I've known. I've never heard of Cmd/del for 'don't save' <comment181301> I suggest you update to latest version 14.4.5 and use the ctrl-tab that was not working in the v 14.3.8! <comment181308> @Tetsujin Apparently Apple made a change with the release of 10.7 (Lion) back in 2011: http://mattgemmell.com/save-sheet-shortcuts-in-lion/ <comment181309> hmm... makes sense... guess I never noticed at the time & spent a couple of years clicking don't save instead [I must honestly have just slept through the entire period... my best excuse]
