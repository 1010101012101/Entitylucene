OSX Partition won't mount. Permissions seem wrong <body> OS X was spinning and spinning when trying to shutdown so I held down the the kbd⌽ Power/kbd button to force shutdown.  Current Situation:  ol liI cannot boot to OS X directly, I first have to boot to single user mode and manually mount the OS X partition (code/sbin/mount -uw //code) then reboot and it works./li liFolder permissions on the Windows side are all screwy, even as admin can't save file to desktop etc./li liI remote to desktop (XP) via Citrix and when I try to copy folder to OS X from the Citrix XP desktop (OS X drive appears in Windows) it will create the folder then say it cannot write to it. A check in OS X  shows the folder is created as read-only for everyone./li /ol  2(*) and 3 may be unrelated and require an alternate thread (happy to create such) but I have them here for completeness.  Possible Causes:  ol liMy computer was slow to sleep so I ran the following commands in Terminal based on an article about Mavericks issues and then I repaired permissions.  precodesudo defaults write /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.coreservices.appleevents ExitTimeOut -int 1  sudo defaults write /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.securityd ExitTimeOut -int 1  sudo defaults write /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.mDNSResponder ExitTimeOut -int 1  sudo defaults write /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.diskarbitrationd ExitTimeOut -int 1  sudo defaults write /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.coreservices.appleid.authentication ExitTimeOut -int 1 /code/pre/li liRecent upgrade to Windows 8.1/li /ol  What I have tried:  ol liDisk Utility from OS X, recovery partition and TechTool edrive (10.9 compatible version). Results:     Incorrect number of threads but cannot fix.   Repairing permissions just has a problem with one printer./li liTechtool Pro (refuses to do a volume rebuild)/li licodefsck/code/li /ol  *) Sometimes I can get the OS X to mount in these programs and sometimes not.  Is there a permissions or partition table issue or something else? Does anyone know how to reverse the command line settings back to their original values?  strongMy setup:/strongbr MacBook Pro 2011 17" (GPU fail seems imminent)br Bootcamp with OS X 10.9 and Win 8.1br MacDrive (on Windows side)br Parallels 8  <answer118139> You could try to reinstall OS X from the recovery partition. If you don't erase the target volume from Disk Utility first, the Reinstall OS X option installs a new copy of OS X over the current installation. It should keep user files and settings in place, so it's not absolutely necessary to even have a backup. It fixed an issue I had where I was not able to start up in OS X.  If you don't already have backups, you can use Disk Utility to save a disk image to an external drive or copy files to an external drive in single user mode.  I don't think it would help, but you can revert the changes to the launchd plists by running these commands in single user mode:  precodesudo defaults delete /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.coreservices.appleevents ExitTimeOut sudo defaults delete /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.securityd ExitTimeOut sudo defaults delete /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.mDNSResponder ExitTimeOut sudo defaults delete /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.diskarbitrationd ExitTimeOut sudo defaults delete /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.coreservices.appleid.authentication ExitTimeOut /code/pre  <answer118803> Ok, I managed to fix but I did have to pay some money.  I ran Disk Warrior from my TechTool Pro drive and it was fixed. Below is the information that it returned.  • 1 file had a duplicate ID that was repaired.!br ! • 17 files had a directory entry with an incorrect text encoding value that was repaired.! ! • 1 folder had a custom icon that was found to be damaged.!br ! • 2 folders had a directory entry with an incorrect custom icon flag that was repaired.!br ! • 3 folders had a directory entry with an incorrect text encoding value that was repaired.!   ! • Incorrect values in the Volume Information were repaired.!br ! • Critical values in the Volume Information were incorrect and were repaired.!    <comment138237> Hey Thanks for the reply. Unfortunately the disk mounts as read only when booting from TTP and recovery partition.... I tried to get it mount write but have failed. Only seems to mount Write when Single User Mode using mount -uw... This seems a similar issue http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/116432/mbp-boots-only-through-single-user-mode
