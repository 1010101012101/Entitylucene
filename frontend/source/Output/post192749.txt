Launch App on connected Device without Apple Developer Program <body> In the WWDC 2015 Keynote, Apple said that with the arrival of XCode 7 and Swift 2 strongit will no longer be necessary to pay the Apple Developer Program suscription/strong to run our own iOS apps on our own connected devices.   What do I need to make use of this new feature?  <answer192753> You will need:  ul lia Mac running Xcode 7 (which is currently in beta and not finished yet)/li lian iOS device running iOS 9 (which is also in beta and not released yet) or iOS 8/li lian Apple ID to sign into both Xcode and the iOS device - this will generate the provisioning profiles needed for your code to run on your devices./li /ul  To get prepared for this, download the beta version of Xcode and follow one of the iOS session videos that show how to run one of the Apple-provided sample projects. You will then build and run that to your connected device as a target.  Eventually, the latest Xcode from the Mac App Store will have these features for anyone to use released versions of the tools on released iOS versions.  <comment229472> I'm curious about this too... Could big boost to the open source iOS community, so long as everyone can compile for their own devices. <comment229477> Also - is someone has questions on what specifically to do in Xcode or has  errors with a specific combination of OS X, Xcode, iOS - please ask a new question. Explaining everything in one answer would be quite long and broad. <comment230246> yeah, it was that easy! Thanks! :)
