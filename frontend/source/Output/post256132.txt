How do I move Siri's window? <body> Just upgraded to mac OS Sierra on my iMac, and Siri was installed as part of that. I have found it generally useful today, and will keep it.  However one annoying feature is that the window is on right hand side of the screen, very near the top. It is covering the tab bar on the right of my browsers. In particular it always covers the most recently opened tab, so I can no longer access that with mouse. If I could just move it down a cm or so it would be fine.  The siri window itself has no controls, and no entries in system menu. It does not respond to attepmts to move it with the mouse.  How can I move the siri window down on screen?  <comment319303> The Siri window is supposed to be open just when you are speaking to Siri and then disappear. Does it stay open? <comment319308> It stays open until I close it (x, top left) <comment319309> It should stay open only if you ask some information shown directly, but then it can be dismissed by typing esc <comment319312> Esc works as well, but in any case I do have to close it, it does not disappear
