iOS6 has loaded someone totally different's details <body> I did an Over The Air update on my iPhone 4S this morning to IOS6. But it has showed me someone elses phone number after the update.  When I send an iMessage to my wife, it comes from this random persons phone number. When I try to facetime, it comes from this other number. But "Phone" shows the correct phone number:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ucvWR.png" width="400" /  ^ This is the FaceTime setup. That is emnot/em my phone number. I have never seen that number in my life before.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4TzHA.png" width="400" /  ^ This is the Phone set up. That emis/em my phone number.  What's going on? How can I change this? Has someone else got my phone number and is getting my wifes messages?  <answer64614> Try changing the number manually. To do that, navigate to: emSettings/em  emPhone/em  emMy Number/em. It will allow you to change the number from there. See if that helps.  If that doesn't help, try resetting your network settings. To do that, go to emSettings/em  emGeneral/em  emReset/em  emReset Network Settings/em. This will not affect your data nor your apps.  <answer65811> Are you signed in with your own apple id? Something like that happened to my bf's sister where she was sending texts/iMessage from HIS number because she was signed into his account for some reason. She signed into her own &amp; it was fixed, but idk if that's your situation.  <answer96337> Sign out, all areas (including Game Center) turn off iCloud an soft reboot, an sign back in  <comment75832> Too much cloud in these phones. Best of luck, I think that Apple is having problems, or was having them with iCloud last couple of days. I don't know why Apple decided to flakify this service. Ugh. <comment75893> As you can see from my photos, the settings  phone  my number is already set correctly. I tried the 2nd one but no luck. It's not related to the phone, it's related to FaceTime and iMessage. <comment77442> No, I only have one apple ID and I was signed in using the correct one.
