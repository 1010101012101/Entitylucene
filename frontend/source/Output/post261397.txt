Calendar "Accept" notice not received by meeting organizer <body> In Apple Calendar I load an emailed meeting invitation (.ics file) from a Lotus Notes user.  It automatically adds all details of the meeting, and syncs with my iPhone.  When I click "Accept", I have a green check mark by my name.  However, the organizer never gets confirmation of my accept notice.  How can I get my accept noticed communicated back to the meeting organizer?
