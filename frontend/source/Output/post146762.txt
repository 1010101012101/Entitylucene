Cannot boot recorvery <body> I am trying to re-install our Mac Mini. Looking around Apple's website, it seems the codeRecovery Disk Assistant/code is the way to do it.  I have followed the instructions for the codeOSX Recovery Disk Assistant 1.0/code.  When I boot, no matter what key combination I try, the boot selection screen does not appear. I have tried holing down the codeAlt/code, codeCtrl/code, codeC/code and codeWindows+R/code keys.  I installed the assistant on an external hard drive and am using a Windows keyboard.  <answer146766> If you're using a Windows keyboard, the Windows key is usually synonymous with option. Hold just the Windows key as the system boots and you'll get the... Options (get it?).  Failing that, if you have an internet connection, try Windows+r. If you don't have a recovery partition it should go to internet recovery and download what it needs from Apple.
