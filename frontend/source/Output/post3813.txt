Is there a hard keyboard case for the iPad keyboard? <body> Is there a hard case for the Apple wireless keyboard for the iPad?  The case is to make the keyboard safe to transport, like in a backpack or something.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YhAhf.jpg" alt=""  <answer3823> I couldn't find any emhard/em cases, but Waterfield/SFBags makes some nice soft cases you can use for transporting your Apple Bluetooth Keyboard:  http://www.sfbags.com/images/prodpage_keyboardtravelcase.jpg http://www.sfbags.com/images/prodpage_keyboard_sleeve.jpg  <answer40462> I really like the inCase Origami Workstation because in addition to protecting the Apple Bluetooth Keyboard, it unfolds to support the iPad in a comfortable typing position.  Andy Ihnatko included it in emA spring selection of iPad-friendly accessories worth a look/em   Apologies for the commerce link above. The link is to the manufacturer's site and they don't separate emproduct/em from emstore/em. The Origami is widely available from a number of sources—I picked mine up at a local Apple Store—and no endorsement of inCase as the retail outlet is implied.
