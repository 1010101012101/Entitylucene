How to copy data from harddrive to time capsule over USB connection via OSX terminal? <body> I want to copy a big amount of data from a harddrive to a time capsule controlled drive.so I put the harddrive via USB to the capsule and connect to the capsule server with a Mac. But when I then move the data to a folder on the time capsule drive by drag&amp;drop it seems to me that the copying goes over WIFI instead of the directest USB data connection way. This takes aeons! Isn't there a way to tell the capsule server to copy the data over their USB connection? thnx! (I asked the same on stackoverflow, but maybe this is the right place for this kind of question?)  <answer68357> Keep in mind that the data flow is "drive - TC - Mac - TC", using the same USB wire both ways. If you want to speed it up, connect the harddrive directly to the Mac.  <comment79359> Asking twice is rarely advisable, please add at least a link to the other question. Regarding your issue: what makes you think that the copy is done via WiFi instead of USB? Did you turn of your WiFi to verify? <comment79365> time capsule has its own server. couldn't I just make the server copy the files by itself? <comment79366> no but the speed tells me. <comment79369> No, it can't (as you've found out) <comment79370> That's an assumption, not a prove. Turn WiFi off to verify. <comment79388> good point. ;-) <comment79390> looks like you're right. besides the design, apple sucks most of the time when it comes to proffessional usage... thnx!
