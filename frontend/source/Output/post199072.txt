Spotlight dark dictionary results with dark mode in Yosemite 10.10.4 <body> Spotlight gives dark dictionary results with some words when dark mode is on:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pQYIQ.png" alt="enter image description here"  I've had this problem since day one of Yosemite.  iMac (27-inch, Late 2009)  <comment238464> Try System Preference  Accessibility  Display  Reduce Transparency On <comment238483> That screenshot is with Reduce Transparency On. Take notice of the rounded corners, spotlight has squared corners with Reduce Transparency Off (see http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/198924/os-x-spotlight-ui-bug/199069#199069). Either way, it makes no difference.
