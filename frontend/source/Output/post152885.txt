Reconnect to VPN automatically <body> I have a Softether VPN server v2.00-9387, which is OpenVPN compatible. I am connecting to it via L2TP protocol on my Windows 7 and Mac OS X 10.9.5 computers, using built-in network connections, without any problem.  I want this connection to reconnect automatically whenever it is dropped on my Mac. For this purpose I created an Apple script using the instructions which can be found here. However I get following error upon running the script:  precodeCan't get &lt;&lt;class svce&gt;&gt; "VPN" of &lt;&lt;class locc&gt;&gt; of &lt;&lt;class netp&gt;&gt; of application "System Events". /code/pre  Could you please help me to solve this problem?
