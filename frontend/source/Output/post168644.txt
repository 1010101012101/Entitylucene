Will SCPlugin work on Mac OS Yosemite (10.10)? <body> I'm looking for a svn client for Mac Yosemite (10.10) which is similar to TortoiseSVN on Windows and RabbitSVN on Ubuntu.  I came across SCPlugin, when I could see that its latest version is dated as Feb-2010.   Would like to know if it works fine on Yosemite? (Or) Are there any other substitute svn clients for the same?  Thanks in advance.  <answer293984> SCPlugin is not working on recent OSX / macOS because the finder does no longer support plugins. Try free svnx or xversion  <comment242331> Looks like it's broken in Yosemite. https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6607645
