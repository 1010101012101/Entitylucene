AppleShowAllFiles Command not working in Mavericks OS X 10.9 <body> I have looked everywhere, but the command  defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE  killall Finder and all variations thereof does not work since I upgraded to Mavericks. Why is this?? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. All advice for 10.8 does not seem to carry over to this new OS  <answer112091> It worked for me in 10.9. You should be using code-bool TRUE/code (not just codeTRUE/code), although it worked for me either way. Also, are you running it as two commands (codekillall Finder/code is a second command)? The only other thing I can think of is that cfprefsd might have the old setting (or lack therof) cached, so you may have to shut it down it first. If I understand the setup right, that emshouldn't/em be necessary, but just in case:  precodekillall cfprefsd defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool TRUE killall Finder /code/pre  <answer112092> To answer your question, you can also use codeYES/code or codeNO/code as the boolean flags (See below). I have been using this setup for a few years now, and it does also work in Mavericks.  I have my computer setup such that I created an Automator workflow that runs the following shell script:  precodeSTATUS=`defaults read com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles` if [ $STATUS == YES ];  then     defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles NO else     defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES fi killall Finder /code/pre  I then used the Keyboard shortcuts panel in System Preferences to map a keyboard shortcut to this automator workflow to make it even faster.  The emonly/em downside to this method is that if you have a Finder window already open, it doesn't always reopen the Finder windows, but it's a much quicker way of enabling/disabling the showing of hidden files.  <comment131907> FWIW `/usr/bin/defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE && killall Finder` and  `/usr/bin/defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles FALSE && killall Finder` are also definitely working for me on 10.9.0
