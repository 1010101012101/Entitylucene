Switch tabs in Safari - Shortcut (⌘ + ⌥ + Arrow) <body> I would like to know if there is a way to switch tabs in Safari with the shortcut used in Chrome (⌘ + ⌥ + Arrow).  Right now with OS X El Capitan, you can switch between tabs but just up to the 9th one with ⌘ + number.  I find it way much easier to switch tabs with the arrows compared to the numbers plus you can get to all the tabs instead of the nine first ones.  <answer211249> You can use codectrl + tab/code to switch to the next tab (equivalent to code⌘ + ⌥ + &gt;/code) and codectrl + shift + tab/code to switch to the previous tab (equivalent to code⌘ + ⌥ + &lt;/code).  You can use this on Safari, Chrome and Firefox, basically with any app that has tabs.  <comment254998> Awesome! Great reply, right to the point.
