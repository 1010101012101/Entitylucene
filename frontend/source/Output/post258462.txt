Select disk destination on app installation with keyboard <body> On most app installers you have to select a disk where you want the installation. Is there any possible way to select it withou the use of the trackpad or the mouse?  <answer258466> Press 'Tab' button on keyboard and/or arrow keys. After you get to the required disk, press 'Enter'.  <comment323127> Doesnt seem to work on the mac os Sierra installer. <comment323192> Might depend on having System prefs  Keyboard  Shortcuts  Full Keyboard Access set to 'All controls'
