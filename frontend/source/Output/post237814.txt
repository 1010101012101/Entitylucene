NFS Mount failed and now it says `Device not configured` <body> I have Macbook Pro 2015, running El Capitan 10.11.1 and I am having issues with NFS mounts. I also have an Android TV Box and it mounts NFS without any issues, so I guess the issue is with my laptop. Here is the NFS config(code/etc/exports/code):  precode/media/mypassport 192.168.2.0/24(insecure,rw,all_squash,anonuid=1000,anongid=1000,no_subtree_check) /code/pre  When I run showmount:  precode$ showmount -e rpi  Exports list on rpi: /media/mypassport                   192.168.2.0/24 /code/pre  I mount from Finder  Go  Connect to Server and enter: codenfs://rpi/media/mypassport/code  This mounts my NFS drive, however sometimes it disconnects and I am not able to remount again. I have to restart my machine and keep trying till it doesn't disconnect.  When I codels/code into code/Volumes/code I get following error:  precode$ ls  ls: mypassport: Device not configured Macintosh HD /code/pre  Whats the issue here? Why it keeps unmounting or gets disconnected? And how do I remount without restarting?   <answer237816> h2Restart NFS without Rebooting/h2  Issue the following command in Terminal:  precodesudo nfsd restart /code/pre  This has the effect of stopping the NFS daemon, starting it back up, rereading your config and processing what's in your code/etc/exports/code  h2OS X Disconnecting from NFS/h2  Try this:   codefind . -name ._* | xargs rm/code on the R-Pi  in the directory that gets mounted.  That will remove any of the hidden "_filename" files that OS X creates when going through a directory  Based on this Apple Support Forum with similar symptoms:  https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2733032?start=0&amp;tstart=0   <comment291478> Let's take a look at your logs on ***both*** machines.  On your Mac, issue the command `syslog | grep -i nfs`.  I don't know what you are running as your host, but you can try the same command there.  If you see anything, rerun the command and append `| pbcopy` to the command so it outputs to your clipboard for pasting here <comment291484> NFS is being run in Raspberry Pi and it uses Raspibian Jessie. Let me post logs <comment291486> It disconnects in one or two minutes. For example, I have mounted the drive and using chrome or anything else, the mac would be still on and not going to sleep. And yet it disconnects. <comment291489> I don't know whats the syslog equivalent for Pi, so I posted output from `dmesg`. Here is the log from my laptop - [link](http://dpaste.com/2VHHBZD) and here is the link to that of Pi - [link](http://dpaste.com/3ZXVECT) <comment291490> Are you running a firewall on your Mac?  If so, turn it off <comment291491> No, firewall is already off. <comment291493> btw here is another log, did reboot and mounted. I didn't use `grep filter` cos there seem to be lines without `nfs` but relevant - [link](http://dpaste.com/3QNQC35)
