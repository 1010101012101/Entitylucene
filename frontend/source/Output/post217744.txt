Flickering band on Macbook Pro from early 2011 <body> I recently got a Macbook Pro 15" from early 2011 from a friend.  It gets a weird flickering band on the left side of the screen. It improves or worsens as I tilt the screen (which makes me think that it might be a faulty/poorly connected cable).  Any tips on how to address that one?   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HK2Aj.jpg" alt="enter image description here"   <comment263350> Luckily for you, that run of MacBooks had some bad graphics cards. I doubt that's your issue, but you can definitely call Apple, tell them you're having problems, and you're covered (they'll try to fix it) through February of 2016.
