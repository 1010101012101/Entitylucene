What does "Share Song" in Apple Music? <body> I clicked codeShare Song/code, but didn't receive any feedback (what Apple Music did).   Is there some kind of social network? Do I have a profile? Who sees the shared songs?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MQpA5.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer249292> You should be getting a pop-up like the below screenshot: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sIAI9.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Then you'd be able to share via any app you like. It will create a link to the song you've chosen to share.  Sources: iOSHacker
