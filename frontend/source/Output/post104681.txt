Transfer music from YouTube to phone <body> Im on my ipad an  I want to transfer my music from my YouTube playlist to my phone with out any cords. How do I do that?  <comment123160> Does your phone have access to YouTube on its own (via an app or the web)? By far the easiest way to do this would be by streaming from your YouTube playlist on the phone directly (since YouTube doesn't offer an easy way to download the tracks to your iPad, let alone send them from there to your phone). <comment123162> Transfer it to your computer then copy from there.
