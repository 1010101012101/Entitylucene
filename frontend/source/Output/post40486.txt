Multiuser GNU screen sessions <body> I am attempting to set up multi user screen sessions on Mac OS 10.7.3 and I run into the error codeAttach attempt with invalid pid(xxx)!/code.  If set it up as follows:  h2Initial configuration of system:/h2  Make the proper permisions for the screen command  precodesudo chmod u+s $(which screen) sudo mkdir /var/run/screen/ sudo chmod 755 /var/run/screen/ /code/pre  h2Screen setup/h2  From code&lt;user_sharing_screen&gt;/code  Initialize the screen with specified session name:  precodescreen -S &lt;session_name&gt; /code/pre  Make the screen multiuser:   precodeC-a :multiuser on C-a :acladd &lt;user_to_share_with&gt; /code/pre  From code&lt;user_to_share_with&gt;/code on the same system connect to the shared screen  precodescreen -x &lt;user_sharing_screen&gt;/&lt;session_name&gt; /code/pre  Then I get the error message codeAttach attempt with invalid pid(xxx)!/code  <answer43271> [Update]The screen utility is broken according to a superuser.com post starting from Mac OS X 10.6.  I was able to compile a working version of screen from MacPorts.org. If you're familiar with MacPorts I could provide you with an updated screen x86_64 binary or the source code patch file (changing one line in socket.c).[/Update]  strongUpdate2/strong Add diff of socket.c  precode--- screen-4.0.3/socket.c   2003-09-08 16:26:50.000000000 +0200 +++ /Users/fluffy/screen-4.0.3/socket.c 2012-03-10 22:58:57.000000000 +0100 @@ -745,7 +745,7 @@    if (eff_uid == real_uid)      return kill(pid, 0);    if (UserContext() &gt; 0) -    UserReturn(kill(pid, 0)); +    return 0;    return UserStatus();  } /code/pre  <answer106605> I created a homebrew fork with the patch shown above and it works for me.

If yes that would use /tmp/screens as temporary directory for the sessions? This means you can skip the part with creating the /var/run/screen directory. Unfortunately I get the same error message when trying to connect. <comment57111> Have you considered using [tmux](http://tmux.sourceforge.net/) instead of screen? Active development and you don't have to jump through all those hoops to get it working on OS X. iTerm even has built-in support for it. <comment57121> I ended up just setting up a server with Ubuntu for everyone to login to. <comment66654> A workaround could be trying tmux? They have very similar functionality. If you edit the criteria, I could answer in more detail if you are open to alternative software. <comment83741> I'm a homebrew user, is there anything comprable I could use? <comment84019> You would have to create a brew formula for it. I haven't done one and frankly I don't see me having time for it right now.
