I am not able to see or use cut/paste in lion <body> I upgraded to lion on the day it was released. After that I updated my system twice even then I am not able to see any cut paste option as specified here.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/C79bN.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Mine is still:-img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BQ26H.png" alt="enter image description here"  Note: Command+Option+V  is not working for me. Nothing happens :(  <answer24890> Assuming you have tried (kbdCommand ⌘/kbd + kbdC/kbd) and (kbdCommand ⌘/kbd + kbdV/kbd), as sometimes it will not show in the edit menu, try a P-RAM reset on the computer. Turn your computer off, then turn on while holding kbdCommand ⌘/kbd + kbdOption ⌥/kbd + kbdP/kbd + kbdR/kbd, the computer will turn off and on, wait for four charms before releasing. Hopefully this will resolve your issue.  <answer27893> You have to press the Option key BEFORE clicking Edit on the Menu. This will dynamically change the menu to show the "move" option.  <comment31991> No need to press Option *before* selecting the menu. The menu commands change dynamically if you press Option while the menu is already open.
