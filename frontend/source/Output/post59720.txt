How to delete or rename files from inside the open dialog on OS X? <body> By default I know that OS X does not allow you to do any modifications from inside the open dialog, like  ul lirename files/li limove files/li lidelete files/li litag files/folders/li /ul  Is it possible to tune the system in order to enable this functionality?  <answer59723> The Default Folder X add-on could help you out here.
