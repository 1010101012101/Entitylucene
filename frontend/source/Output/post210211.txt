PPTP VPN won't connect after updating to El Capitan <body> This is a 2015 rMBP and after I updated to El Capitan (have not installed any betas) my PPTP VPN connection just hangs on "Connecting". If I then click "Disconnect" it hangs similarly until I kill pppd.  Anyone have this problem and found a solution?  Edit: system.log after clicking "Connect":  precodeOct 15 19:03:56 nspassov nesessionmanager[5803]: NESMLegacySession[VA:0CABA80E-F475-40F9-B087-AF2C698ADB71]: Received a start command from com.apple.preference.network.re[23190] Oct 15 19:03:56 nspassov nesessionmanager[5803]: NESMLegacySession[VA:0CABA80E-F475-40F9-B087-AF2C698ADB71]: status changed to connecting Oct 15 19:03:56 nspassov pppd[23225]: NetworkExtension is the controller Oct 15 19:03:56 --- last message repeated 1 time --- Oct 15 19:03:56 nspassov pppd[23225]: password not found in the system keychain Oct 15 19:03:56 nspassov pppd[23225]: publish_entry SCDSet() failed: Success!
