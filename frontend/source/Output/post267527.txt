iTunes says I have 8k photos but I only have 6k on my iPhone? <body> I synced some photos from iPhoto to my iPhone. iTunes says that the photos were synced and there's 8000 photos in my phone.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/e0mCe.png" alt="iTunes"  But when I checked my photo the photos I synced weren't there.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WGtlz.jpg" alt="Camera Roll"  Can someone please help me with this?  <answer267531> Photos you sync from iTunes don't go into your Camera Roll â€” they go into separate albums. Look further down the albums list to find synced photos.
