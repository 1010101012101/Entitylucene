Time capsule not backing up <body> Since many days, my time capsule, isn't making any backups. I checked the light status and its green, when choosen the command for backup now, it spends good amount of time (10-15 min) saying "preparing backup" and then failing, and upong entering "Time Capsule" preferences and choosing the red icon, I am showed the following message img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aaFCF.png" alt="enter image description here"  I tried restarting time capsule and my mac. But nothing works, My system is updated too. How can i fix this problem and why is it happening?  <answer123647> It clearly advises you to use Disk Utility and repair your back up disk.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/E4jxl.png" alt="time machine error"  <comment144394> so did you use the disk utility as recommended to check the disk <comment144444> I did that already, nothing happens. <comment144483> @Buscarì›ƒ yes, i already did prior to posting this. But nothing. infact i don't see my time capsule device in it. <comment144484> If as you say you do not see the time capsule in disk utility, then you did not repair that drive. <comment144485> then you did not repair it! <comment144486> is it a USB disk, or how is it connected during the Disk Utility process ?
