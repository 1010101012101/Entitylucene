How to screencapture just the active display in a dual monitor setup? <body> When I use kbd⇧/kbd+kbd⌘/kbd+kbd3/kbd to take a screenshot with my laptop connected to a external monitor, it output a couple of images, one for each display.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/neRaS.png" alt="enter image description here"  Is there any way to take the screenshot of just the active monitor instead of both?  BTW, I know that exist kbd⇧/kbd+kbd⌘/kbd+kbd4/kbd that let me select a region, but this is not the idea.  I found the command codescreencapture/code that can capture only the main monitor with code-m/code option.  precodescreencapture -m ~/Desktop/screencapture.jpg /code/pre  But, what about second monitor?  <answer161418> I think from looking at Apple's official list of screenshot shortcuts, the shortcut that comes closest to what you're trying to do is   kbd⇧/kbd + kbd⌘/kbd + kbd4/kbd + kbdSPACEBAR/kbd.    After pressing that combination, you need to click on the window you want a screenshot of.  Since there's no other shortcut on the Apple-provided list that can capture the active screen, I believe you'll have to use this unless there's a third-party solution that allows different key combinations.  <comment187557> This would be very helpful. <comment187578> Have you tried Grab? It might allow you to do something along those lines. <comment187590> @baum, yes I tried it. But is even slower that have to erase one screenshot every time I take a screenshot. My point is, I never used both images, and asked thinking of a way to avoid one. <comment188665> I knew the shortcut, but, when you use it selecting a whole desktop does not work. It only capture the wallpaper without windows. <comment188671> @jherran You have to hover over the window, then click inside it.  There's no way to capture the whole screen. <comment188672> So, don't answer my question.
