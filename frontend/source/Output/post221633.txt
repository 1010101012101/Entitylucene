Several items disabled on iPhone <body> On my daughter's 5s, running iOS 8.1.2, the following items are disabled in settings:  Settings  Messages  iMessage (it's there but the on/off toggle is off and disabled)  Settings  FaceTime (it's there but it's greyed out and you can't tap it)  Settings  iTunes and App Store  Apple ID (it's there but greyed out and you can't tap it)  Settings  iBooks  use cellular data (it's there and on, but greyed out and you can't change it)  Settings  iCloud (it's there but greyed out and you can't tap it)  Settings  Twitter Settings  Facebook Settings  Flickr Settings  Vimeo  The above 4 are all there and greyed out and you can't tap them.   Restrictions is turned on, but nothing is restricted.   We have switched the phone off and on.   We have checked the time zone is correct.   We have gone through Settings  General  Reset  Reset Network Settings, then re-connected to Wi-Fi.   We have gone into the App Store app  Featured tab, and scrolled to bottom. Her Apple ID is displayed, with credit, but greyed out.   We have gone to the Apple ID website and signed in with her account, without any issue and without any warnings or comments about the security of her account. Her newsletter subscription language was Indonesian, which is unusual, but apart from that I couldn't see anything amiss.   Help?
