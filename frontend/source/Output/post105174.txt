Launch script after command finishes <body> I find myself running some long scripts/commands and I don't want to wait looking at it until it finishes. On the other hand, I would like to know right away when it ends. I know you can do the trick with code&amp;&amp;/code, but it seems like a lot of typing.  Is there a way to do this by actually putting a post-execution hook in bash? I know this is Bash related and not so much OS X but maybe there is something hidden in OS X.  <answer105180> There's no post-execution hook, only a pre-execution hook: if set, the value of shell variable codePROMPT_COMMAND/code is executed prior to issuing the prompt. See man bash for details.   An option would be to create a function that tells Terminal to beep after the long command is run, so you know when it finishes. Such a function would be:  precode$ function r { $@; beep; yourscript; } /code/pre  Your script will be automatically launched after Terminal makes a beep.  Use the function to run those long commands like this:  precode$ r longcommand /code/pre  You can add the function to your code.bashrc/code file to avoid defining it every time.  If you're not a fan of audible bells you can tell Terminal to flash instead:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LxZxJ.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment123673> Is running `&&` *really* that much extra typing?… <comment125858> Just realised I put `&&` which is one too many `&`, so it's even less typing… :)
