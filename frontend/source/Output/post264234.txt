I've just updated to the latest CC software 2017.0 releases - and not seeing the custom touch bar. A Google search yields a ton of news article demonstrations without actually telling you how to enable it.   A corollary question is - which are the context-specific touchbar apps?   <answer264831> You run Photoshop CC 2017 Version 18.0.1?  From the release note:      Use the Touch Bar with Photoshop - Photoshop now supports Touch Bar,   the multitouch display at the top of the new MacBook Pro keyboard;   Touch Bar support in Photoshop is currently a technology preview   feature   Adobe said it is an experimental feature. It could be that this functions is not turned on automatically.   You can turn it on here: Preferences  Technology Previews  Enable Touch Bar  <comment332900> I noticed 18.0.1 just came out :)
