searching an nfs-mounted volume <body> Does anyone know of a GUI way to search  mounted network volume without using Spotlight? We use a cluster roughly 80TB and need a client-side way of searching for files without indexing the entire thing every two seconds...  <answer53035> I'd recommend checking out EasyFind to see if it solves your problem. My shop has been using it to search SMB network volumes.  <comment60642> Thanks very much! Works like a charm and is surprisingly fast...!
