RDP from OS X to Windows using RD/TS Gateway Services? <body> I am trying to connect from my Mac 10.8 to my work Terminal Services server. It think it runs Windows Server 2008. When using the RDC Client on strongWinXP/strong âžž strongWin 8/strong it bring up these menu options:    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Gep8w.png" alt="enter image description here"    You can see here it has the strongcomputer/strong and the strongusername/domain/strong field. Then when I go to the strongAdvanced/strong field, I get the following:    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dEkbe.png" alt="enter image description here"    When I open up CORD, it is missing the option to put the strongcomputer/strong name in the field. For strongRDC/strong to my work network, I had the IT people look at both CORD and Microsoft RDC for OS X and they couldn't figure it out.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/q35tu.png" alt="enter image description here"  Can anyone shed light, based on those settings in my RDC (which is running on Windows 7 in a Parallels environment) how I could join to my network. Everyone says I need to be able to specify the following things:  ol liURL to join emlogon.tech2group.com.au/em/li liDomain and Username emstream/danijel.james/em/li liComputer name at the other end emrdfarm002/em/li /ol  <answer103764> These are the mappings from the MS RDP application to CoRD:  precode MS RDP Field                          CoRD Field  ----------------------------------------------------------  Computer                              Address  Domain part of your username          Domain (STREAM in your screen shots)  Username part of your username        Username (danijel.james in your screen shots) /code/pre  The RD Gateway server stuff isn't supported by CoRD though so you might be out of luck.  You can try RDP'ing to your RD Gateway (use codelogon.tech2group.com.au/code in the codeAddress/code field in CoRD) and then RDP'ing from that machine in to another machine.  The only RDP application for OS X that I know of that supports RD Gateway/TS Gateway services is iTap. It's not free, it's $24.99, on the Mac App Store. I haven't used it personally so I can't tell you if it's worth the money and supports RD Gateway the way it promises to.  <answer123095> Unfortunately, unless you are already a registered iTap user, it's no longer available as of October 8, 2013.  Microsoft's latest free version (8.0.3) does not support TS Gateway services.  I've been looking for something that does, but no luck so far.  Anyone have a suggestion?  <answer123405> Microsoft's new version, v8.0.3, actually does support RD Gateways. I have just successfully made a connection through one today.  https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-remote-desktop/id715768417  <comment122136> I'll give it a look and see how I go. I spoke with someone else here, and they said the same thing - it needs the computer name, the IP or the URL, and the username with domain. So it must have either 3 fields with username/domain combined, or 4 fields specifying each. We can't RDP to any other computer in the domain unfortunately. It's setup specifically to be for our Windows 7 desktops, which I do not use personally on my desk anymore.
