How do I install ios10 without a developer account? <body> Apple announced iOS 10 during WWDC 2016. It looks amazing so I wanna install iOS 10 on my iPhone 6s. But I don't have a developer account of Apple.  <answer242702> Without any research on the matter I would say: you can't.   That's exactly what developer account are for:Â so a new software / a new system can be released to a small group of expert users. While the software / system may already look ok in a presentation, it probably still is way too buggy for the average user. So  either be patient, or become a developer.   Also, Apple has released the last few major OS upgrades (for both Macs and iPhones/iPads) as Public Beta some months before the official release. This will allow you do get your hands on these new versions some time between now and whenever-the-release-date-will-be.  <comment298649> You don't want to yet. It's incredibly buggy, all the widgets break (until us developers get to them) and many features (like Siri + apps and Messages + apps) just don't work yet. Battery life has been killed by the first beta, so it's obviously not ready for public consumption yet. <comment298997> Thanks! I'll wait for the official release of iOS 10.
