Mount & unmount volume notifications <body> For the last month or so, I have been receiving notification windows in the upper right-hand corner whenever a volume is mounted or unmounted (i.e. portable hard drive, Time Machine, etc.) How do I turn these notifications off?  <answer10508> Check to see if you have Growl installed - it will be in System Preferences. Sometimes applications install it without your permission - even though the growl team explicitly don't allow it. Its safe though, I use and love the product.    <answer10521> If Growl is installed and you want to turn off just the notifications for volume mounts and dismounts (as opposed to getting rid of Growl altogether):  ul liSystem Preferences, Growl panel/li liApplications tab/li liSelect HardwareGrowler from the list/li liConfigure/li liNotifications tab/li liIn the dropdown, for each notification (e.g. Volume Mounted) you want to disable:/li liSelect it and untick the 'Enabled' box./li /ul  (Edit:) Or, as fnurl points out, remove HG entirely. I find it useful enough to keep, but tweaked to my liking.  It alerts me if my WiFi starts bouncing, f/ex.  YMMV, as always.  <answer10552> I use HardwareGrowler to get these messages.  Perhaps HardwareGrowler is launching at startup? If you do not want this, go to  emSystem Preferences → Accounts → Your Account → Login items/em  and find HardwareGrowler and remove it from the list.  <comment11019> As far as I know, this isn't built in to the system. Do you remember installing any software to trigger this?  Also, do you just mean that an icon appears on the desktop, or a real notification box appears?
