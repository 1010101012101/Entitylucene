how to upgrade iPad 1 to iOS 6 <body> I am having trouble with installing apps from App Store,  it pops up "this app requires iOS 6.0 and later".. I've been trying to upgrade the iPad to iOS 6.0 and it is saying iOS 5.01.is the latest version..  What to do?   <answer290465> The latest supported version for the 1st generation iPad is iOS 5.1.1. That means it's strongnot possible/strong to upgrade it to iOS 6 (or higher). You'll have to buy another one. Even if it would run iOS 6, it would be terribly slow. Modern apps are developed with way more memory and CPU power in mind.  <comment366638> Your iPad is too old to be updated, so you have to buy a newer iPad or live without the app.
