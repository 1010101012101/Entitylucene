Is there a bluetooth camera that works with an iMac? <body> I want to put a webcam in a far corner of my office and use it for Skype.  Do you know of a bluetooth or other wireless camera that will show up on a Mac like a regular camera?  <answer222312> What exactly are looking for? A Security Camera? Take a look at BestBuy's, Amazon or the AppleStores camera section. Most USB, Bluetooth or Ethernet cameras should be supported out-of-the-box.  Here are some ideas:  Withings Home HD WLAN  Video Camera  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1ffi5.png" alt="Withings Home HD WLAN Video Camera"  Arlo Netgear Wire-Free  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RmGZz.png" alt="Netgear Arlo Wire-Free"  NetCam Wi-Fi Camera with Night Vision img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IOsDS.jpg" alt="NetCam Wi-Fi Camera with Night Vision"  <comment269420> Thanks. Do you know if OSX actually shows these cameras as webcams that can be accessed by other apps? <comment269470> I don't see why this shouldn't be possible. e.g. in Skype you can select the video source.
