How to open applications in fullscreen via Terminal <body> I just created a script to open my most-used apps, but I have two questions about it.  The code of the script is the following:  precode#!/bin/bash echo "Hi $(whoami)" echo "Openning your default apps..." open -a Mail open -a Wunderlist open -a Reminders open -a Notes open -a Pocket open -a Safari echo "Do you want social networks? [y|n]" read social if [[ $social == "y" ]]; then     open -a Telegram     open -a Safari http://web.whatsapp.com     open -a TweetDeck fi echo "Do you want to listen some music? [y|n]" read music if [[ $music == "y" ]]; then     open -a iTunes fi echo "Have a nice day $(whoami)! :D" /code/pre  So here come the questions:  ul liHow can I open those apps in fullscreen by default? iTunes have memory and open in fullscreen mode, but the others don't./li liHow can I keep Terminal in foreground while the other apps are being open?/li /ul  <answer219972> On the Fullscreen-question: I guess there is other ways to do it but using AppleScript is one of them.  For Safari it would be something like this:  precode/usr/bin/osascript -e 'tell application "Safari"' -e "activate" -e 'tell application "System Events"' -e 'keystroke "f" using {control down, command down}' -e "end tell" -e "end tell" /code/pre  Just substitute the applications and the right keystroke in the line and use this instead of the 'open' command.  <answer219975>    How can I keep Terminal in foreground while the other apps are being open?   Use the code-g/code or code--background/code flag to codeopen/code:   precode -g  Do not bring the application to the foreground. /code/pre   for example:  codeopen -g -a Notes/code  will open Notes.app in the background.  Unfortunately not all apps appear to respect this. For those apps you may need to hide them manually using AppleScript:  codeosascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to set visible of process "FOO" to false'/code  where codeFOO/code is the name of the app.  p.s. - instead of code$(whoami)/code you can use code$LOGNAME/code   <comment267033> Where can I learn how to do AppleScript? Do you know any manual or website that explain the syntax?
