Default Browser .plist location <body> I have a custom built browser, lets say its similar to a firefox port such as Ice Weasel. I am wondering where I register this so that it will appear in the System Preferences  General  Default Browser menu.  I can view the current defaults on the command line from:   precodedefaults read ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices/com.apple.launchservices.secure.plist /code/pre  However, this only seems to give me what is actually set as my defaults and not as what CAN be set as my defaults. It's the latter portion that I am interested in. What do I need to do in order to register my custom browser so that it can be set as the default?  I'm guessing there is a .plist file somewhere for that?  <answer219584> You don't add yourself to this plistâ€”OS X manages this itself. For example, download a new browser and copy it to the Applications folder. Without opening it once, OS X will add it to the list in System Preferences.  This is achieved with the following in the Info.plist in the app:  precode&lt;key&gt;CFBundleURLTypes&lt;/key&gt; &lt;array&gt;     &lt;dict&gt;         &lt;key&gt;CFBundleURLName&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;string&gt;http URL&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;key&gt;CFBundleURLSchemes&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;array&gt;             &lt;string&gt;http&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;/array&gt;     &lt;/dict&gt;     &lt;dict&gt;         &lt;key&gt;CFBundleURLName&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;string&gt;Secure http URL&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;key&gt;CFBundleURLSchemes&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;array&gt;             &lt;string&gt;https&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;/array&gt;     &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/array&gt; /code/pre  <comment265579> Does the `defaults read defaults read...` have a special reason or is it just an error? <comment265583> it was a typo. thanks for catching it. i fixed it :) <comment348400> if you want the custom browser to open `file://` URL schemes, add this as well between the last `/dict` and the `/array`: `dict         keyCFBundleURLName/key         stringLocal file URL/string         keyCFBundleURLSchemes/key                      stringfile/string         /array     /dict`
