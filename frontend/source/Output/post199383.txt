How Can Web Sites (Ad Networks) Connect to Different IPs? <body> I use Safari on my Mac, and I also use Little Snitch (Awesome program, but it can get in the way, from time to time).  When I connect to some sites (not always the same ones), it tends to rat out the site for trying to establish a connection to a different IP than the one I am on (usually, an ad site).  Of course, I always block the attempts, but it makes me wonder how the heck ad networks can get around the XSS restrictions on AJAX.  This has been happening for about six months.  On the face of this, it looks like an alarming security issue.  Anyone know of a place I can read up on this?  <comment239978> did you look if those web sites have "redirect" <comment239979> That doesn't make sense, to me, though. AJAX won't let you connect to a server other than the one you are connected to. As a Web developer, I run into this all the time, and have to program around it. That's what is puzzling to me. I only see this in Safari, not Chrome, so I suspect that some protocol is being invoked in Safari that does the XSS. If it weren't for Little Snitch, it would be completely invisible. I would try using Charles Proxy, but it is infrequent enough to make that a huge pain. Even refreshing the page clears it, so only specific ads have it. <comment239987> I have not seen that problem with Firefox and my chosen DNS. <comment239995> Do you see these requests when the page is opened initially or some time after the page has finished loading? <comment239998> @Buscarì›ƒ would you recognize an XSS attack?    MAGNAWS is it opening in frame on the page? <comment240069> @Alistair McMillan: It happens after the page has loaded (maybe after a delay after that). Sometimes, I only see it when I close a page. Tyson: It is probably a frame, but I'll check. <comment240070> @MAGNAWS Probably the best thing to do here is to give us an example of a site that is doing this. There are various methods that could be used by less scrupulous developers to get around XSS restrictions. Without an actual example, this is all guesswork. <comment240080> @Alistair McMillan: I'll be looking at it a bit better in the future. I figured that this is something that a number of folks are seeing, as I ain't that tinfoil, compared to some. Little Snitch is really great. I suggest it. You'll be shocked at how many apps phone home. <comment240085> @MAGNAWS I used to use Little Snitch, probably still have a license. Don't have any need for that extra noise right now. And, sadly, I wouldn't be shocked. :)
