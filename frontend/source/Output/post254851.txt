OS X Yosemite - cannot remember Keychain access password <body> Is there any way to recover this?  Can I change it without knowing my current password?  <answer254858> No. You cannot recover the contents of the keychain without the password. There is no way to reset the password retaining the keychain data.  hr  If you want to access a login keychain after changing user's password, the keychain will still be accessible using the old password.  If the problem is reappearing password prompt after a login password change, you can delete and recreate the keychain, but the original data is non-recoverable.
