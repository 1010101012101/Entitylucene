OSX (Yosemite) Make 2 sided printing the default for *all* applications <body> I'd like to make double-sided printing the default for strongall/strong applications.  This item tells how to set it for one application, but by experimentation it only affects that application, not others.  I Googled, looked in the system prefs, looked on this site - no luck.  Is there a setting somewhere?  <answer182185> First save your print settings as a preset:  ul liOpen a document, then choose File  Print. Click Show Details./li liChoose any print settings you want to save as a preset./li liClick the Presets pop-up menu, then choose Save Current Settings as Preset./li liEnter a name for the preset settings, then choose whether to use the preset for only the currently selected printer or all printers./li /ul  Then make that preset as default: hold the Option (alt) key when choosing your preset, and it will become Default.

I spent some time solving this earlier today and here's another way: in a web browser, enter  http://localhost:631/printers in the address box and press Return. After the list of printers is returned, click on the printer in question. It took me quite a bit of poking around to find the setting for single-sided/double-sided as a default. I suspect one advantage to this technique is that it sets the default in the emprinter/em, where the Option key method may only set it for that emprint queue/em. Since deleting and re-creating a print queue is a standard troubleshooting step, the web browser technique might be a better long-term solution.  <comment311180> What an incredibly discoverable feature. Thank you!
