Finder acting different after mounting a DMG in Lion vs SL? <body> If I recall correctly, when mounting a DMG file in Snow Leopard, the Finder window with the App would become active.  In Lion, this isn't the case. Instead of the window becoming active, you have to manually select it. A small gripe, but annoying nonetheless.  Anyone have thoughts on this or how to rectify the problem? A terminal command to force the Finder window into focus perhaps?  <comment49139> possible duplicate of http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/7608/5118
