How I can activate the iPhone which is asking for credentials I don't remember? <body> I was going to sell my iPhone tomorrow, and I thought I'd reset it so that none of my things were on there. I had already made an iTunes and AppleID for the buyer and was going to set up the phone for them.  When one resets a phone it asks for the AppleID password. I entered that and then the iPhone was reset.  When it came to activating the phone again, it is asking for an iCloud account email and password which I can't remember. I know the password its just the email, so I went to reset my iCloud email and it won't let me - only my AppleID which isn't the same.  Can anyone suggest how I can activate the iPhone?  <answer164861> ol liDon't set it up for the next owner, let them do it themselves.
