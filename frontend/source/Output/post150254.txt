How do I search Recent Calls on iPhone? <body> I am looking for a phone number in my history. All I know is the area code 808, which will narrow it down immensely, and its having occurred between a month and two months ago.  How can I search the call history for the area code?  iPhone 5s, iOS 7.1.2  <answer285174>    Sorry for bad english, What I want to say is when a iphone connects to   the mac operating system, so the face time app which is inside the mac   system automatically detects the call history of the iPhone user. But   facetime account's log in should be same in mac sytem and iPhone. Then user   can able to search from recent calls from facetime app in Mac to get any number as asked in   this post.   <comment176853> It would help to know what phone - but if it's an iPhone my guess is you can't, other than scrolling down the list. Spotlight only seems find numbers that are also in your contacts. <comment177060> Would it not be assumed that the default phone on an Apple Q&A page would be the iPhone? ... moreover on other brands of phone searching through contacts and history is trivial! Apple omit such elementary functionality? Astonishing! Infuriating!! <comment177083> It would indeed be reasonable to assume that the default phone on an Apple page is an iPhone, but knowing the model and OS version helps people look for an answer, and also sometimes people post off-topic questions here. Similarly, you could be talking about searching for recent calls in Skype running on a Mac, or in some other program; it is better to specify, but yes, your defaults do make sense. <comment359593> This answer, as written, is very difficult to understand.
