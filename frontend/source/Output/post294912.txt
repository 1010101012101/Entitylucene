Prevent SoundFlower installation? <body> As I do some audio development I regularly have to install related software (DAW's, etc).  Also I use an RME audio interface that comes with Totalmix software.  For me that means I do not need any further audio-routing within the computer.  Nonetheless Soundflower gets installed (by some DAW?) regularly and without asking. And what's worse is that some Applications on updating select it as the default audio-I/O. So that is something I would like to prevent. Best at the root of it (i.e. prevent installation). If not possible maybe there is a way to configure it to be always off? Any hints on how to get rid of it (apart from regularly deleting the kext)? Which Software might it be, that relies on it? Max for Live??  <comment372202> Nothing should install Soundflower without asking. In fact no app can install system-level *anything* without you giving your permission. Are you sure you uninstalled it correctly? Method depends on which version is installed. https://support.shinywhitebox.com/hc/en-us/articles/202751790-Uninstalling-Soundflower might be useful. <comment372205> agree, it should not. it does though (and if program functionality depends on it, it might be argued that permission for that program should naturally extend to soundflower install).. i did delete the kext and the receipt (only one in both cases). and i did reboot. still.. <comment372206> Really, no. OS X will not allow any app to simply install kexts without asking. Apps install in one of 2 ways - drag to Apps, or run an installer. The 2nd requires admin authorisation before anything other than just the app itself is installed. If you subsequently remove it, it will need to ask again. <comment372208> I'm quite sure I never explicitly authorized SoundFlower installation. But then, who knows.. Would be good if this were my error, meaning it won't happen a 3rd time.
