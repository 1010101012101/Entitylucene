Is it safe to delete the contents of Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup if using iCloud? <body> My /Users/{username}/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup is 5GB and I'd really like to reclaim that space if I can.  I back up my iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch to iCloud, so is there any reason not to simply delete the 9000+ legacy backups in this folder?  <answer52109> Yes, it is safe to delete it, if you are sure you want to emlose/em those backups.  To do so, in a more emelegant/em way, just:  ol liOpen strongiTunes Preferences/strong /li liClick emDevices/em/li liLocate the backup for the iOS device you want to delete, select it, and click strongDelete Backup/strong./li liConfirm you wish to remove the selected backup by clicking Delete Backup./li liClick OK to close the iTunes Preferences Window./li /ol  Extracted from Apple's support document about iOs backups.  strongConfirmed:/strong Deleting through iTunes will delete strongall/strong the backUp files of the selected device.  <comment59600> If you wanna save space, try the free app monolingual, which removes duplicate binaries of apps written for power pc processorsâ€¦ saves like 2gb <comment59602> The problem is that there are over 9000 files in that directory, and there are only TWO devices (each with one backup) listed in the iTunes Preferences panel. <comment59603> I can't test this right now, but you could try deleting, from the iTunes preferences, the backUp for one of the devices, and see if it deletes all the backUps for it. Or just, *cough* delete the content of the folder. <comment59641> Judging by the dates, there are several backups in there for the one device.  Maybe, if you do a "restore from backup" you would get to choose among them? <comment290503> I believe the folder also includes downloaded copies of iOS updates, if you have upgraded from itunes
