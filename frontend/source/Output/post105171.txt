Stream DVD audio through AirPlay <body> Hi have a Bowers &amp; Wilkins Z2 which supports AirPlay.   When I see DVDs on my MacBook Pro I would like to stream the audio to the speaker.  Is there a way for doing it?  While iTunes provides an icon for AirPlay, the same is not true for QuickTime.  VLC 2.1.0 has a command in the Audio menu (codeAudio/code-codeAudio Device/code-codeAirplay/code) however it doesn't work for me.  <answer120309> Go to System Preferences → Sound → Output and choose your speakers. Lagging will probably make it unbearable, but maybe you can adjust video/audio sync in VLC.  <answer126538> An alternative is hold the 'option' key and click the audio icon on the menu bar. A special audio menu will appear, which allows to select the AirPlay device as default audio output.
