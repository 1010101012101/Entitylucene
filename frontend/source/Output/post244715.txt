CalDAV only works for first synchronisation, and then stops updateing the calender forever <body> From the same server I can successfully sync cardDAVs contacts, and IMAPs-mail, so I've ruled out network issues.  Furthermore, that same installation also syncs many other users (non-i) -Devices Contacts, Calenders, and Mails, so I've ruled out SOGOs CalDAV implementation.  This Problem is not present on the WinPhones, Androids(with DavDroid), Thunderbird/Lightning, and even Outlook 2010. I kind-of feel stupid now having recommended iDevices in the past.  I tried:  ul liRebooting normally/li liSigning out of iCloud, then rebooting/li liFactory-reset, then configuring the CalDAV first, then the rest./li liOpened the non-SSL Port (shudder) to the outside world for testing./li liCreating the Calender "twice", Once as Calender, and once as Contactlist/li /ul  None of those worked, and the last one was impossible through the settings dialog  I'm not quite sure, how to proceed. In the meantime, I bought some cheap androids, so that my users at least have their calendar on the road with them.  <answer244716> Did you check in Settings  Mail, Contacts, Calendars  Fetch New Data  Fetch Every 15 minutes.  Maybe it is set to Manually.  <comment301625> No, set to 15 Minutes. My users have also attempted to manually update by "dragging down" from the calendar view. <comment301631> What sync option do you have at https://sogo.nu/? <comment301668> it's self-hosted, haven't seen options on first run-through, that would make it work everywhere but the iDevices. Its mostly running on (good, imho) defaults. <comment301671> Take a look at the error logging or enable debug mode on your server
