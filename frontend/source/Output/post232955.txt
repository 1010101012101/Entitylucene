Why exactly do people consider the Mac Pro 3,1 (Early 2008) PCI bus too slow for fast GPUs? <body> I've upgraded the GPU on my MacPro3,1 (Early 2008) from the original 8800GT to a 6870 and things were fine. I've been looking recently to take it another notch up the ladder, but I've stumbled across some posts which suggest that the machine's PCI bus is too slow for anything past a (say) GT 680.  Now I know the FSB and PCI bus of the older Core 2 architecture isn't PCIe 3.0 nor the best speed demon when it comes to memory performance, but I haven't seen any real quantification of emwhy/em there is such a bias against the old machine.  Does anyone have any numbers to back up the claims? I'm looking at 2013-era GPUs at this point since I think going with a 2015 GPU is probably not going to buy me much over my 6870.
