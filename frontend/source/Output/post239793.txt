Syntax highlighting in QuickLook <body> I'm looking for a way to have syntax highlighting for my source codes in El-Capitan's QuickLook without installing TextMate. Previously I had TextMate and I got hooked to this feature.  Googling this bring some really old posts on web such as:  How do I get syntax highlighting of source code files within Quick Look back in Lion?  These are not maintained anymore based on their SVN/Git repo:QLColorCode and colorqc2  Surprisingly there are also some people who wants to get rid of syntax highlighting after installing TextMate:  Remove Quicklook Syntax Highlighting with TextMate2?  Having syntax highlighting is essential for me but I don't want to install a full featured text editor just to use on library of it!  My rationale in not installing TextMate on my El-Capitan is that I have RStudio and Atom which are way more customized/customizable than TextMate.  I would appreciate any suggestion/solution that is maintained properly, work with el-capitan.  Cheers,  <answer239796> Finally ... I found page providing some QuickLook solutions based on Homebrew's caskroom:  precodebrew cask install qlcolorcode /code/pre  This is based on a fork from and old repository but is maintained and developed quite well at least until today.  I gave it a shot and it works just fine, though I still prefer the dark theme of TextMate :)
