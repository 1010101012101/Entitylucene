How to remove a folder link from side bar in OS X Lion <body> I've updated my OS to Lion today. But now, I can't remove the folder "maven-2.2.0" from Finder Sidebar. This folder was deleted from my computer, and I can't right click on it.  How to do it?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/alsAS.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer19446> Hold down kbd⌘ Command/kbd while dragging the item out.  I found this Lion change interesting; I don't necessarily like it, but I think it mirrors the way that you have to hold down ⌘ when rearranging toolbar items.  <comment96748> I have the same problem, but thank you so much Jtbandes, I can solve it now with hold down ⌘ and drag it out side to remove it from toolbar.
