Fix WiFi connectivity on iPad 3 <body> We have a relatively old iPad 3 (a bit older than 3 years now). About one week ago (When we added a keyboard case) it started massively dropping in WiFi connectivity / quality. It mostly shows full connectivity in the icon in the top left. The Router (FritzBox 7270) is working absolutely fine (we get a perfect connection, fine speeds etc. on our phones). The Router is about 5-8m away from the iPad normally. When opening up the Youtube app, it often needs about 1min (!) to even start the Videobuffering, on Safari it often tries extremely long to search for pages. Once it has found the video in the youtube app, it normally (but sometimes even not without stuttering) goes through without problems.  What is wrong here with the iPad and how can we fix that?  Something wrong with the iPad itself? Something wrong with the keyboard case? Something wrong with the router?  Thanks for any ideas.  <comment330200> There is something wrong with the iPad for sure. The keyboard case definitely has nothing to do with it. <comment330202> @books453: So, just we should bring it to some repairman for checkup?
