MacVim -- how to make Ctrl+A go to beginning of line, Ctrl+E to the end of the line <body> I'm trying to switch to MacVim as my main editor, and I'm liking it so far, except for one issue:  I got really used to the Mac shortcuts kbdcontrol/kbd-kbdA/kbd to go to the beginning of a line, and kbdcontrol/kbd-kbdE/kbd to go to the end of a line.  However, these two don't work in MacVim (kbdcontrol/kbd-kbdA/kbd does something weird -- it seems to increase the last number in a line by 1 or something, and kbdcontrol/kbd-kbdE/kbd seems to scroll down the screen by one line).  Any way to make these two shortcuts go to the beginning of a line / end of a line respectively instead?  <answer49751> Add the following to code.vimrc/code or code.gvimrc/code:  precode:" Map Ctrl-A -&gt; Start of line, Ctrl-E -&gt; End of line :map &lt;C-a&gt; &lt;Home&gt; :map &lt;C-e&gt; &lt;End&gt; /code/pre  <answer56304> Those are actually emacs shortcuts that OSX is using, so you're asking how to emulate emacs key bindings in vim, which is a little unintuitive.  Id highly suggest getting used to either ^ to go to the beginning of a line, or I (shift-i) to go to the beginning of the line and switch to insert mode.  <comment56954> Perfect. Thanks :) <comment236671> I don't use mac, but you might want to use noremap instead of map, in case you ever want to map Home or End somewhere else.  In addition, you might want to use imap (or inoremap) in addition so that the hotkeys work in insert mode.
