Issues with installing Social Engineering Toolkit (S.E.T) <body> I'm trying to install Social Engineering Toolkit (S.E.T) on OS X Lion.  I found these commands in the internet: codegit clone https://github.com/trustedsec/social-engineer-toolkit/code   codecd social-engineer-toolkit/code  codepython setup.py install/code  codesetoolkit/code  But after I do codepython setup.py install/code it gives me this output:  precodeSaffet-iMac:social-engineer-toolkit SaffetYurtoglu$ python3 setup.py install Searching for pexpect Best match: pexpect 4.2.0 Adding pexpect 4.2.0 to easy-install.pth file Using /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5/lib/python3.5/site-packages Processing dependencies for pexpect Finished processing dependencies for pexpect Searching for pycrypto Best match: pycrypto 2.6.1 Adding pycrypto 2.6.1 to easy-install.pth file Using /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5/lib/python3.5/site-packages Processing dependencies for pycrypto Finished processing dependencies for pycrypto Searching for pyopenssl Best match: pyOpenSSL 16.0.0 Adding pyOpenSSL 16.0.0 to easy-install.pth file Using /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5/lib/python3.5/site-packages Processing dependencies for pyopenssl Finished processing dependencies for pyopenssl Searching for pefile Best match: pefile 2016.3.28 Adding pefile 2016.3.28 to easy-install.pth file Using /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5/lib/python3.5/site-packages Processing dependencies for pefile Finished processing dependencies for pefile /code/pre  It seems like everything is ok but nothing happens. What should i do?  <answer247990> In a vanilla Lion installing Social Engineering Toolkit works if you use  precodegit clone https://github.com/trustedsec/social-engineer-toolkit cd social-engineer-toolkit sudo python setup.py install /code/pre  (which will install some necessary tools/libraries to /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages).  After "installing" the toolkit use codesudo ./setoolkit/code to start the SE Toolkit.  Here are some env variables:  precode$ python --version Python 2.7.1 $ which python /usr/bin/python $ python -c "import sys;print(sys.path)" ['', '/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python27.zip', '/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7', '/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/plat-darwin', '/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/plat-mac', '/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/plat-mac/lib-scriptpackages', '/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Extras/lib/python', '/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/lib-tk', '/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/lib-old', '/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/lib-dynload', '/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Extras/lib/python/PyObjC', '/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages'] $ echo $PATH /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11/bin /code/pre  hr  You probably installed Python 3.5 – which is not included in OS X Lion – and modified some env variables. Without further informations your SE Toolkit install can't be salvaged.  <answer248144> The answer here was that there was an error in the $PATH in John's .bash_profile. For some reason, despite removing all the bits about python3.5/3.6 in .bash_profile, the export path command was putting them back in. This was solved by explicitly referencing all the paths and not adding on the current stored $PATH. The install is now using the correct python version.  <comment306062> It gave me the same output. I think i installed 3.5 packages too. Should i delete them ? <comment306082> What does the "same output" mean? Yours or mine? <comment306088> I mean same output as mine. `sudo python setup.py install` gave me the same output. And after that i did the same with python 2.7 and again i got the same but just the version numbers were 2.7 i couldn't copy it here it is too long. <comment306089> @John Which Python 3.5 did you install? Homebrew or another installer? Please add a link if you have installed a different one (non-homebrew)! And did you [repair your Lion install](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/247739/deleted-usr-local-bin-and-usr-bin-on-os-x)? <comment306090> Yes i reinstalled my mac.I downloaded the python 3.5 from  python.org <comment306113> @John I installed Python 3.5.2 additionally and it doesn't interact with the Lion's Python (2.7.1). I didn't change any env variables, bash profiles or system paths after installing Python 3.5.2 though. The SET install works after installing Python 3.5.2 like described above. Strange! <comment306126> So do you suggest me anything? I really don't know what to do. It seems like everything is right but nothing is happening , i don't get it. And i just realized that if i do `sudo setup.py` it gives me the same output i don't need to write install to get this return. <comment306128> i mean `sudo python setup.py` <comment306359> Comments are not for extended discussion; this conversation has been [moved to chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/43397/discussion-on-question-by-john-issues-with-installing-social-engineering-toolkit).
