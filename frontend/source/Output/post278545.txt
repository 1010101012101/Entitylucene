How do I save a text file with a Ruby (.rb) file extension? <body> I am new to Ruby and am trying to learn from a book. However, I have one problem – it says I should save a file so that it ends with code.rb/code but my Mac only lets me use code.rtf/code so that's what I used. But the next thing I needed to do was open it in Terminal and the command codecd /Users/username/ruby/code didn't work for me. I'm guessing the reason for this is because I didn't use code.rb/code it didn't work.  So my question is: strongWhat should I use for writing Ruby in the end of that command, or for saving with the code.rb/code extension?/strong  <answer278546> What you do is get yourself a proper code editor or IDE. Using TextEdit to write code is a very bad idea. Personally I'd recommend Sublime Text 3 because it has good text highlighting for many different languages, is free (well technically isn't, but for learning like you're doing, not buying a license should be ok), and is pretty lightweight but you should do some research and reach your own conclusions about which code editor or IDE is right for you.  <answer278549> You could only save as .rtf because the file was strongrich text/strong. To make it plain text, simply press kbd⇧ shift/kbd-kbd⌘ command/kbd-kbdT/kbd or go strongFormat/strong  strongMake Plain Text/strong, then you can save as .rb.  Try not to use TextEdit: there is no syntax highlighting and code completion, not to mention that you have to manually turn off those wrong quotation marks.  <answer278552> Could always use good ole codevim YOURFILENAMEHERE.rb/code within Terminal.   When you want to type, enter insertion mode by pressing kbdi/kbd; if you want to exit insertion mode, press kbdESC/kbd. Then to save your file just press kbd:/kbdkbdw/kbdkbdq/kbdkbdEnter/kbd (save and then quit).  Of course you miss out on all of the IDE features but it's a great text editor that is built in.  <comment350580> TextMate is another possibility: https://macromates.com/download
