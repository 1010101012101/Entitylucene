Why such slow download of windows support software? <body> I have been trying to download the Windows support drivers for Boot Camp all day, using a wired gigabit network connection.  The indicator gets about half way along then refuses to move. There is plenty of space on the USB hard drive I'm sending the drivers to.  <answer100322> You can download the Boot Camp Support Software directly from here (554 MB).  A workaround with instructions and link to download can be found here:  ol liThe download file is a code.zip/code file. Double click it to uncompress it,  if it is not automatically uncompressed./li liDouble-click the codeBoot Camp5/code folder./li liCopy the entire contents of the code.zip/code file to the root level of a USB flash drive or hard drive that is formatted with the FAT file system./li liWhen running Windows, locate the codeBoot Camp/code folder on the USB media you created in Step 3 and double click to open it./li liDouble click on codesetup/code to start installing the Boot Camp Support Software./li liWhen prompted to allow changes, click on codeYes/code and follow the onscreen instructions./li liInstallation can take a few minutes.

I stop the downloading process, and I want to delete the files in my computer. <comment288902> Ok, we can download that zip. But how BC 5.1.4 will locate it? There is no possibility NOT to download that support software from internet :-(
