Set Default NFS v4 when connecting from Mac OS X Lion <body> I have installed an NFS File Server on Ubuntu 11.10, and that is working well.   I am only able to connect to the NFS server from my Mac with this command:  precode mount -t nfs -o vers=4 10.0.10.26:/srv /Users/admin/Desktop/mount /code/pre  But I cannot connect via Finder (nfs://10.0.10.26:/srv) or through any third party programs that don't allow for the version parameter. The Syslog error is      mount_nfs: can't mount /srv from 10.0.10.26 onto   /Users/admin/Desktop/mount: Program version wrong   Is there any way to set this to V4 by default? Either server side or on my Mac? I need to be able to connect without the extra parameters.   Thanks  <answer55863> The syntax for using NFS v4 (and passing options in general) is :  precodenfs://vers=4,10.0.10.26/srv /code/pre  You can check the mount afterwards from the Terminal using :  precodenfsstat -m /code/pre  <answer209068> Hmmm, seems we need to have this question re-answered every major release of OS X.  So I can only say this works on 10.10.x :)  From OS X's man page for mount_nfs  em"nfs.conf(5) can be used to configure some NFS client options. In particular, nfs.client.mount.options can be used to specify default mount options"/em  To get the Finder to default to using NFS v4 add the following to /etc/nfs.conf using the terminal command "sudo vi /etc/nfs.conf"  precode nfs.client.mount.options = vers=4 /code/pre  Again, to check after mounting use "nfsstat -m" and check the "NFS parameters".  <comment188255> I found (OSX 10.9.5) that this was no good. The comma ends up in the mount command. Investigating the command it ran (from the ps list) I saw that this resulted in a command:      `mount_nfs -odeadtimeout=45 nfsvers=2,example.com:/var/www /Volumes/www`  - which was a failure. Experiments with other variations of spacing before the hostname seemed to help a little. Entering an nfs URL       `nfs:// -onfsvers=2 example.com:/var/www`  - Including those spaces looked like it should have worked, but for some reason still did not.
