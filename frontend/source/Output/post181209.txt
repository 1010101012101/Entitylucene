How can I change the encoding of a subtitle file? <body> I have a subtitle .srt file. Is there an app which can change the encoding of this file.br (I guess it's encoding is Arabic(windows-1256) but vlc and MXPlayer didn't open it.) The link of subtitle is here.  <comment215462> Is there a Apple product involved in this ? <comment215466> @Buscarì›ƒ My laptop is MacBook Air and I'm searching for an app or a way to do it. <comment215469> If it is not asking to much, please provide the link to the subtitle file so we can check on it. <comment215482> It seems to be in Arabic (DOS) encoding.  You could open in TextEdit and resave as UTF-8 or what ever you want.
