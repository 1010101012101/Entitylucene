Outlook 2011 category colors - Windows Color Palette? <body> Does anybody know what are the RGB "equivalents" of the category colors that MS uses in the Windows version of Oulook 2010?  Just starting to use a Mac "for real work" (vs tinkering with it as a set-top player in the past). I'm setting up my Mac Outlook/Office environment "just so" and one of the things I'm missing is to be able to construct the same categories and emassociated colors/em that I have been using on Windows.  I've been mucking around, and I already have the proper list of categories loaded, but I can't figure out what are the equivalent to the MS-provided colors. The Apple-supplied palette is to "bright" for my taste. I've seen that it's possible to create new colors/palettes (while in the Windows version it's not - that's an improvement IMO), but I haven't been able to find the RGB specs of the colors themselves...  Thanks!  EDIT: To clarify, the "colors" I'm looking for are the ones you get in Outlook 2010.  I've got a screenshot of the ones I mean:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wmhVZ.png" alt="Outlook 2010 Category Colors"  They have names such as "Olive", "Blue", "Dark Red", "Dark Maroon"....  <answer96061> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FV1UB.png" alt="Default Outlook Colors"  Using code/Applications/Utilities/DigitalColor Meter.app/code set to codeRGB as Actual Value, 8-bit/code and then hover over each color to find it's RGB color values.  h2Color Values:/h2  precode## COLOR       HEX     (RRR GGG BBB)  1 Red         #E7A1A2 (231 161 162)  2 Orange      #F9BA89 (249 186 137)  3 Peach       #F7DD8F (247 221 143)  4 Yellow      #FCFA90 (252 250 144)  5 Green       #78D168 (120 209 104)  6 Teal        #9FDCC9 (159 220 201)  7 Olive       #C6D2B0 (198 210 176)  8 Blue        #9DB7E8 (157 183 232)  9 Purple      #B5A1E2 (181 161 226) 10 Maroon      #daaec2 (218 174 194) 11 Steel       #dad9dc (218 217 220) 12 Dark Steel  #6b7994 (107 121 148) 13 Grey        #bfbfbf (191 191 191) 14 Dark Grey   #6f6f6f (111 111 111) 15 Black       #4f4f4f ( 79  79  79) 16 Dark Red    #c11a25 (193  26  37) 17 Dark Orange #e2620d (226  98  13) 18 Dark Peach  #c79930 (199 153  48) 19 Dark Yellow #b9b300 (185 179   0) 20 Dark Green  #368f2b ( 54 143  43) 21 Dark Teal   #329b7a ( 50 155 122) 22 Dark Olive  #778b45 (119 139  69) 23 Dark Blue   #2858a5 ( 40  88 165) 24 Dark Purple #5c3fa3 ( 92  63 163) 25 Dark Maroon #93446b (147  68 107) /code/pre  emNote: color values returned by color meter might be slightly different based on the selected color profile./em  Make a custom color and use the RGB Sliders and enter the decimal values above.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TaXRX.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer131593> Microsoft provides this mapping of color name to RGB value:  http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee203806(v=exchg.80).aspx  <answer132596> Using the link provided by @The Face of Bo above (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee203806%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx), the matching RGB values for the "named" MS colors are:  precode  Base R,G,B    Color name    |--------------|------------|    255, 255,255   No color       214, 37, 46    Red    240, 108, 21   Orange     255, 202, 76   Peach      255, 254, 61   Yellow     74, 182, 63    Green      64, 189, 149   Teal       133, 154, 82   Olive      50, 103, 184   Blue       97, 61, 180    Purple     163, 78, 120   Maroon     196, 204, 221  Steel      140, 156, 189  Dark steel     196, 196, 196  Gray       165, 165, 165   Dark gray     28, 28, 28 Black      175, 30, 37    Dark red       177, 79, 13    Dark orange    171, 123, 5    Dark peach     153, 148, 0    Dark yellow    53, 121, 43    Dark green     46, 125, 100   Dark teal      95, 108, 58    Dark olive     42, 81, 145    Dark blue      80, 50, 143    Dark purple     130, 55, 95    Dark maroon    /code/pre  (The formatting is a bit messed up, but I can't manage to get it "nice looking" as @hoss accepted answer!)  <comment112896> Hi, Hoss thanks for the info - but these are not the colors I'm looking for (or at least, not all). I've edited the question to show the ones I'm refering to. <comment112928> open `/Applications/Utilities/DigitalColor Meter.app`then hover over each color to get it's RGB value as needed. I'll update my answer to include this. but if I have a moment I'll enumerate the attached colors. <comment113057> updated my answer to include all of the standard colors. <comment113095> Thanks a lot, both for giving me the info, and also "teaching me how to fish"!! <comment154645> While this link may answer the question, it is better to include the essential parts of the answer here and provide the link for reference. Link-only answers can become invalid if the linked page changes. <comment157046> Added an self-response to showcase Microsoft's official list of RGB Values, thanks to @hoss
