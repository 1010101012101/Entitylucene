How do I make my meta keys work in Synergy? <body> I would like to make my keyboard work as expected when using Synergy. When I press kbdCmd/kbd + kbdAlt/kbd + kbdL/kbd I would like to see the pipe character.  My setup:  ul liServer - MacBook Pro - French layout (Mac)/li liClient - Ubuntu 13.04 - French layout (Non Mac)/li liSynergy - v1.4.1 (Latest version on Client and Server as this stage)/li /ul  The key kbd*/kbd / kbd$/kbd and kbd7/kbd / kbdè/kbd works fine but the combo kbdAlt/kbd + kbd$/kbd which is supposed to give kbd€/kbd does not work.  I've tried different layouts on the Client with different versions of Ubuntu and also keyboard layouts such as Frech Macintosh or Macbook Pro.   I've enabled the Access for Assistive Devices settings as per this post since it's a requirement for Synergy.  Is this something specific to international keyboards? I'm sure there must be some developers on MacBooks that have encountered this problem but I could not find any postings that helps in my case.
