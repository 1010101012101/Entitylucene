Viewing Composite Document File V2 Documents <body> Every now and then I receive attachments from Windows users that show up as "Picture (Device independent Bitmap)" and - when I run "file" on the command line, they are identified as "Composite Document File V2 Document".  I guess they are screenshots - what would be the best way to view them on a Mac?  Thanks.  <answer239337> Based on the output from codefile/code I'd suggest that you try codeunoconv/code to convert it to something your system can open.   <comment99349> When you Control-Click on the item, what shows up in the Open With menu? Preview? How about Safari? Device Independent Bitmaps are BMPs, a common Windows picture format. You might even be able to view them with QuickLook. <comment99377> I get preview as the default application, and then an error message that says: "The file “foo.bmp” could not be opened. It may be damaged or use a file format that Preview doesn’t recognize"
