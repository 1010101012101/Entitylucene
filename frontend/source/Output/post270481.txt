How can I make Apple Watch connect to the 2G endpoint without having to retype all my 5G passwords? <body> I know that the Apple watch will only connect to 2G wifi networks, and not the 5G version that I use most often.  Is there any way I can easily redo my wifi connections on 5G so it will also have a corresponding 2G network (for the watch)?  I'm thinking I might be able to use a synched Keychain on iOS and then copy and paste the Wifi networks, and removing the "-5G" suffix. Resync, then done.  Not sure if the keychain approach on OSX would sync back to the watch, but it's worth trying.
