macOS - ntpd uses more than 100% of CPU <body> it happens couple times every day, my MacBook becomes extremely slow. When I check Activity Monitor, I see that codentpd/code process uses more than 100% of my CPU (usually around 140-180%).  If I kill it (Force Quit), MacBook starts working as usual. But it will happen again in several hours. How can I fix this issue? It becomes really annoying  It started after one of the software updates (not sure exactly when).  MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Late 2013) with strongmacOS 10.12.3/strong  <answer281845> Go to System Preferences  Date and Time and uncheck Set date and time automatically. Close System Preferences, then reopen and re-check Set date and time automatically  <answer296068> Check if the NTP servers you have configured are correct and reachable.  Open a Terminal window and run  precodentpq -p /code/pre  This is the output I got on my system which had ntpd using around 80-90% cpu.  precode     remote           refid      st t when poll reach   delay   offset  jitter ============================================================================== *aer-foo5d20-dc- .GPS.            1 u   23   64   17   17.888   20.617   2.226  aer-foo6t20-dc- .GPS.            1 u   23   64   17   17.938   20.598   2.211  defra1-ntp-001. .INIT.          16 u    -  68m    0    0.000    0.000   0.000 /code/pre  This shows that I had 3 ntp server configured, the 2 first ones are ok but the 3rd one was unreachable (I'm no NTP expert but refid=.INIT., st=16 and reach=0 all seem to indicate something is wrong).  So I went to System Preferences  Date and Time , where indeed I had 3 ntp servers configured: 2 inside my company's network, and codetime.apple.com/code - so nothing resembling "defra1-ntp-001". Assuming "defra1-ntp-001" referred to time.apple.com I removed that one, and this resolved my problem.  Of course in my specific case, probably time.apple.com was unreachable because it is blocked by my company's firewall, so I don't recommend removing it as a general solution. Instead check your 'ntpq -p' output and try to determine which server is causing the problem and remove that one (and if none are left, add a known good one).  <comment346533> Go to `System Preferences  Date and Time` (unlock if needed) and uncheck `Set date and time automatically`. Close System Preferences, then reopen and re-check `Set date and time automatically`. Make sure the time server info is correct for your location on the planet. <comment346539> just did it, will check in a few hours if it helped, thanks <comment348524> @IconDaemon looks like it helped. If you can post your solution as an answer, I will confirm it <comment370488> Thanks for answer - this helped resolve my 200% utilized process.  I presume this is an OS bug?  Has it been reported to Apple?
