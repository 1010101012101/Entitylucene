Buy from the iOS AppStore via desktop browser and have app auto-install to my iOS device? <body> The question sums it: How can I buy from the iOS App Store and have it download to my iOS device, perhaps telling it?   Anytime I attempt to go to the AppStore website, it keeps trying to push me towards iTunes, which I don't have installed on all my computers (e.g. my work computer). I'd like to fire up a browser on my work or other machines, log into the AppStore from the desktop browser, purchase and push the app directly to one of my AppleID linked devices, it's gotta be possible in this day of cloud and mobile computing. (like Android or Windows Phone 8/10).  What am I missing here? Is there a different link? Different setting?  <answer178156> You can't do it from a browser. iTunes is the only way to actually purchase something. However, you can use codeSettings/code  codeiTunes and App Store/code on your iDevices to configure them to automatically download any new media that gets attributed to your Apple ID, such that you'll automatically get any new apps that your Apple ID buys on any device.  <answer178204> To go to the iOS AppStore from a Windows on OS X machine you need iTunes as that is the only app that knows about IOS things.  However if you browse on the iOS device you go direct to the AppStore and don't need iTunes  <answer251470> If you set up automatic download of purchased apps on iOS, then when you buy / get an app from iTunes, apple sends a push notification to your iOS devices to download their copy of the app.   Alternatively, you could sign up for a hosted MDM like bushel and use your browser to push apps to your device.   ul liIs it possible to remotely install an app on an iOS device from the web/iTunes?/li /ul  <comment210969> What machine are you using to browse the AppStore website? <comment210970> Added info to question. If it's a browser it could be any machine but right now it's a Windows 8.1 Macbook Pro. <comment210972> Are you sure? I find it unbelievable for 2015/iOS 8 ... Any data supporting that assertion? <comment210973> @DeepSpace101 I'd love to be proven wrong. If there's a web-based way to make iTunes purchases, that'd be awesome. However, knowing security-minded Apple, I wouldn't be surprised if their reasoning for doing this was because they have total control over iTunes, whereas you never know what bugs could be lurking in browser extensions and whatnot. <comment210974> They allow me to buy a $3000 Macbook Pro from within my browser, so surely buying a $1 or $5 app should be acceptable from a security perspective. I love my Apple products but this is such a let down from an app-economy perspective ... too much friction. Oh well.
