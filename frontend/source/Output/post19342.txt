NTFS mount issue in Lion <body> I am getting this error. Can anybody help me?  /Library/Filesystems/fusefs.fs/Support/fusefs.kext failed to load - (libkern/kext) requested architecture/executable not found;  <answer19347> You probably need to upgrade to a new version of MacFuse. Unfortunately there isn't one available. See this blog post. So there is a new project called OSXFuse which is going to support this. Here is the link to the Github project. https://github.com/osxfuse  I hope this helps a little.  <answer43256> Check Fuse4X project, it should help you. Here is another lengthy article about current state of NTFS on OSX.  <comment21300> http://handyrandy.tumblr.com/post/279850663 - perhaps this could help? <comment37104> FYI, you'll not be able to share a drive using other format than HFS+ on Lion, send my thanks to Apple. <comment49163> Answers on Ask Different need to be more than just a link. It's okay to include a link, but please summarize or excerpt it in the answer. The idea is to make the answer stand alone.
