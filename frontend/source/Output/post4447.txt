How to Listen For an Application Launch Event on Mac OS X <body> I wrote an AppleScript to mount a bundled sparse disk image. I want this script to be executed exactly when Time Machine launches.  I can check if Time Machine is running with codeon idle/code statement,  precodeon idle     ....     return &lt;interval&gt; end idle /code/pre  but I'm pretty sure, it isn't a robust way to do that.  IMO making an event trigger for codeApplication Launch/code event would be a better approach.  I appreciate if someone can help me.  <answer4885> You can use a LaunchAgent (see Lingon) to perform an action when a file is modified. Time Machine has some file somewhere that it modifies each time it starts.
