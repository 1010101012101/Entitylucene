How to remove a user from staff group in macOS? <body> How on earth do I remove one of my local user accounts from the default "staff" group in macOS? I've tried many of the obscure commands in the command-line to no avail, i.e dscl, dseditgroup.   This is what I tried:  precodedsmemberutil checkmembership -U someuser -G staff /code/pre  Response:  precodeuser is a member of the group /code/pre  Tried removing:  precodesudo dseditgroup -o edit -d someuser -t user staff /code/pre  Checking membership:  precodedsmemberutil checkmembership -U someuser -G staff /code/pre  Response:  precodeuser is a member of the group /code/pre  How come?  I want to remove a particular local account from the staff group so that it doesn't have access to the contents of home directories of other local accounts, amongst other things.  Any commands and/or GUIs that you can recommend for this?  <comment362314> Pay attention on this answer: https://stackoverflow.com/a/35574494/2174275
