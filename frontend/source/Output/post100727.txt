Adding New Contacts but they Disappear <body> When I add a contact from my keypad screen and save it the contact doesn't show up in my contacts list.  But if they call or text me it recognizes the contact.  Why is it doing this and how do I fix it?   <answer100778> Try this:  ol liOpen codeContacts.app/code/li liPress the codeGroups button/code in the top left corner./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Vfu85.png" alt="enter image description here"  ol start="3" liSelect codeShow All Contacts/code./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OECTF.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment118548> What version of iOS are you on? And follow these steps first and then let me know if it still doesn't work: Open "Contacts.app",Press "Groups" button, Select Show "All Contacts." <comment118595> Thanks that seemed to have worked. <comment118613> Tara, I will repost this as an answer for other "Googlers" to see.
