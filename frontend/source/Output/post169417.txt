File upload not uploading <body> I have a problem loading a picture file into facebooks "whats on your mind". I select the little picture icon, a file upload shows up, I select the picture file from the desktop where I have the picture on the desktop in .pictClipping and it is chosen by clicking on the "open" at the bottom of the file upload As soon as I click on "open" I get a small screen saying "no file chosen".   Any Ideas for correcting the once working procedure.??   <comment198984> How does this relate to Apple hardware or software? <comment199003> This is Facebooks fault. <comment199014> Please clarify what brings you to the assumption that this is Apple-related and also specify which OS X and Safari versions youâ€™re using.
