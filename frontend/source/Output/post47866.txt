Is there a scale indicator bar for the Maps app on iPad? <body> I'm using Google Maps in the Maps app on my iPad but I cannot find a scale bar.br Where is the scale bar for Google Maps in the native Maps app on an iPad?  <answer47945> There is no scale bar in Maps for iPad. I think it is not official (yet) because even on Android it can only be enabled from the "Labs" settings. So, it is not part of the official Google Maps images.  <answer48434> There is no scale bar in the Maps app, but you can use the app Mapscale, which gives you exactly what you desire.  <comment55524> Welcome to Ask Different!
