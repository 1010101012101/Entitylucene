How do I restore missing menu extras (clock, wi-fi, etc)? <body> When I log in to Mac OS X (10.10.5) I sometimes find that most of my menu extras are missing (clock, wi-fi, sound, bluetooth, etc.). If I logout and login, they almost always come back, but this takes too much time.  I suspect the problem is caused by menumeters but I find this menulet too useful to uninstall it.  How can I reset my menu extras (aka menulets) without logging out?  <answer202411> I was able to get my menu extras back without logging out by running codekillall SystemUIServer/code in the Terminal.app.  I found the answer from zane's Recover missing menubar icons - revisited System post. The post is from 2006, but the trick still works on Yosemite.
