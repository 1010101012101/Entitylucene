macvim not respecting os/x shortcuts <body> I have macvim working as expected on my older mac. On a newly minted Mac however, the normal key sequences to select, copy, and paste text:   precode  Shift arrow keys (select)   Command C, Command X, Command V (copy, cut, paste) /code/pre   are not being recognized.  Then there must be some settings/configuration required to get the Cut/Copy/Select using OS/X keystrokes to work in macvim?  What is/are those settings?  thanks!  <answer201093> I actually had to enable codecua/code mode manually.  That had not been necessary on my other Mac - so it is strange.  precode~/.vim/plugin/cua-mode.vim /code/pre  Taken from:  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fabi1cazenave/cua-mode.vim/master/plugin/cua-mode.vim  <comment241179> Did you copy your `.vimrc` settings from the old machine to the new machine as well? <comment241180> well that would make sense - sure ;)  I had anticipated some special customizations would not be availble until I do that (machine not presently accessible..)   But the modest surprise would be:  apparently macvim does not *default* to the CUA bindings ? <comment241202> It's been a while since I've used MacVIM and not just plain-old-vim, but my recollection was: no, it didn't use the normal OS X bindings for copy, paste, etc. There are also issues using `mvim` to launch MacVim from within a `tmux` session and the OS clipboard not being shared. <comment241407> I copied the .vimrc from the other machine - and the shortcuts still do not work.  I am really surprised at this point.
