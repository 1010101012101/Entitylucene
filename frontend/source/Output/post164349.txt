Windows Server causes massive lag in Yosemite after 30 minutes <body> I upgraded to Yosemitte about a month ago or so. It runs super smooth for the first 30 minutes or so and inevitably it starts to bog down severely. I checked activity monitor and Windows Server is using a high percentage of the CPU's resources. Generally it happens when I am running a program that uses a database of some sort (I believe it uses postgres). The specific program I am referencing is Poker Tracker 4. As soon as I reboot, the problem is fixed.  Are there any tweaks or setting changes I make to the OS that will help alleviate the problem?  Thanks,  Matt  <comment192682> You mean WindowServer? Windows Server is kind of confusing in a Mac forum ;) <comment192748> Yeah, unless they mean "VirtualBox/Parallels/Whatever in which I run Windows Server"... which seems unlikely. <comment192980> Yes, I mean WindowServer.
