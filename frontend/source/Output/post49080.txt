Address Book won't restore contacts from .abbu <body> My Address Book won't restore contacts from my address book archive (code.abbu/code).  I sync my address book with iCloud.    A couple weeks ago, Address Book told me there were some inconsistancies in my contacts.  It said that 12 of my contacts were outdated. The "updated" versions that it presented were actually versions that were older by several weeks or months.   ul liI told Address Book repeatly to ignore the changes so it kept on asking me. /li liI exported my correct contacts as a code.abbu/code file. /li liI also back up with Time Machine so I should have a good copy there.  /li liI deleted a "bad" contact from my Address Book, and then tried to import the .abbu file, the contact I deleted appeared for a second and then disappeared.  /li liI then deleted my entire Address Book.  /li liI tried again to import the .abbu file.  All the contacts appeared for a  second and then disappeared. /li /ul  This happen when iCloud was added in perferences and syncing and when it wasn't.  Deleting the file AddressBook folder in code~/ApplicationSupport//code also didn't help.  <answer49172> It was caused by iCloud.  Went offline, opened .abbu file, exported as vCards, went online, cards removed themselves.  Deleted iCloud account from Mac, added vCards, readded iCloud to Mac.   Fixed.  <answer79152> This works only if you don't have groups.  The point of having the ABBU file is to preserve everything, including groups.  To solve for that you have to copy all contacts and all groups to "On My Mac" and then delete the iCloud contacts before reconnecting to the internet.  Then once connected you have to move everything back to iCloud.  What a royal pain!  <answer114828> This took a lot of trial and error to discover, but it preserved my groups:  ol liGo into iCloud on web; select and delete all contacts./li liDisable internet connection, but keep iCloud account enabled in Contacts application./li liImport contacts archive into Contacts application on Mac./li liDisable iCloud account in Contacts application (which will move all iCloud contacts on Mac to new category, On my Mac)./li liTurn internet connection back on./li liRe-enable iCloud account in Contacts (which causes iCloud to merge full Mac address book with empty iCloud address book, but it doesn't tell you it's doing this â€” no dialog box asking you to merge or overwrite or cancel)./li liFinally, to avoid confusion, delete duplicate set of contacts labeled "On My Mac" on the Mac. (I do this to avoid confusion of accidentally adding/editing Mac-only contacts. There is a preference setting to make iCloud the default for new contacts, but this can toggle on/off without one's knowledge.)/li /ol  <answer145556> Check this posting in the apple forums from 9/16/2014. It's possible to preserve group information as well.  https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4638825  <answer196006> Export Address Book Archive..., or vCard), so restore them whichever way you backed them up. ....   <comment56287> Sometimes messing around pays off :) <comment71389> Wanted to add that disabling network access makes this a lot easier otherwise iCloud will keep removing newly imported contacts and groups. <comment234048> We're looking for long answers that provide some explanation and context.
