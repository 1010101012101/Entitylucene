Is it possible to prevent TextEdit's "The file has been changed" dialog from appearing unnecessarily? <body> Every so often, I  will be doing something on my computer (e.g., in Google Chrome), when an alert dialog from TextEdit.app randomly pops up. The dialog looks like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9bvIw.jpg" width="549"  The dialog asks if I want to save changes made to an open or minimized RTF document in TextEdit. The dialog sometimes appears even when TextEdit is not the active application; the dialog comes out of nowhere.  My answer to this dialog, 100% of the time, is kbdSave Anyway/kbd. This is because hitting the kbdRevert/kbd button irrevocably changes the file to the last-saved version of the file (which is obviously undesirable).  ol liIf the document is not being edited in another application, then why does this message appear? Or, how can I figure out which application (i.e., em"another application"/em) is responsible for the changes to the document, exactly?/li liIs it possible to prevent this dialog from needlessly appearing?

Try opensnoop on the file to determine the process which is accessing the file:  precode$ sudo opensnoop -f /path/to/file.txt   UID    PID COMM          FD PATH   501  32092 Finder        14 /path/to/file.txt     0     81 mds           28 /path/to/file.txt   501  41898 mdworker       9 /path/to/file.txt   501  42646 TextMate      16 /path/to/file.txt   501  42646 TextMate      16 /path/to/file.txt   501  42646 TextMate      25 /path/to/file.txt   501  42646 TextMate      26 /path/to/file.txt /code/pre  This is a live printout, so keep the opensnoop running until you get the sheet, then check your Terminal window and look back to see the process. ⌃C stops opensnoop when you're finished. You will need to disable System Integrity Protection to use opensnoop and can be re-enabled afterwards.  <answer286844> h2Closure:/h2  I followed the instructions provided by user emgrgarside/em in their answer.   I realized that the .rtf file was, in fact, being altered by another application. Hence, it is entirely appropriate that I was given the kbdThe file has been changed by another application./kbd dialog.  As emgrgarside/em suggested, the dialog never actually appeared needlessly.  Specifically, the file was being changed by an AppleScript of mine. The solution was to implement a check in the AppleScript code, to see if the .rtf file was already open. If the .rtf file was open, then I made sure that my AppleScript code would not write text to this file.  After I made the fix to my AppleScript code, I have never seen this dialog again.  <comment359168> I get the following message in Terminal after entering the `opensnoop` line: `token too large, exceeds YYLMAX`. Do you know how to fix this? <comment359181> @rubik This is due to incorrect quoting in opensnoop for files with spaces in the path. Open `/usr/bin/opensnoop` with a text editor and add a pair of double quotes directly around the $ variables on lines 162 and 163. 162 should now read `inline string PATHNAME = "'"$pathname"'";`, such that each side of quotes went from `" '` to `" ' "` (without spaces). <comment359200> How do you save the edited file? I can't save it in TextEdit or TextWrangler. I am given the error: _`You don’t own the file “opensnoop” and don’t have permission to write to it.`_ I also tried pasting the edited file in the `/usr/bin/` folder, and it wouldn't work. When I try to change the file or folder permissions via the "Get Info" window in Finder, I get the error:  _`The operation can’t be completed because you don’t have the necessary permission.`_ But, my user account is an administrator account and it is the only user. <comment359203> @rubik You'll need to disable System Integrity Protection to modify system files. Since you have to disable it to use opensnoop, I forgot to mention that. <comment361443> Do you happen to know what `RSScriptRunner` and `cp` refer to? Based on [my `opensnoop` log](http://i.imgur.com/6ofLw9T.png), I believe that it is one or both of these processes that is responsible for accessing/editing the .rtf file in the background.
