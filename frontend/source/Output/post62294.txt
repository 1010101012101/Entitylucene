Can't copy into my own Public folder <body> I can't copy into my own Public folder neither with my finder nor from terminal 'sudo cp ~/temp/gyongyinek/* ~/Public/'  If I execute the above command from terminal I got this: Operation not permitted If I want to copy from finder then the crossed out mouse cursor appears suggesting that the operation is invalid...  This is my Public directory access flag: drwxr-xr-x+  3 boti  staff     204 Jan 11  2012 Public  If on finder I hit Command+I then I have the following access rules: Fetching: Read Only Fetching: Read Only boti(Me): Read &amp; Write staff: Read Only everyone: Read Only  <answer63020> I found the solution The folder was locked...  <comment71982> I also checked the disk permissions but they were ok. <comment71983> Ohh... The folder was locked... Sorry for the stupid question.... <comment72553> Can you post it as an answer so the question won't get bumped up later? <comment72741> Oh thank you :) That is a good idea
