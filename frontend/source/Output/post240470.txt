How to switch keyboard layout on right cmd press <body> I want to make a shortcut for keyboard stronglayout switching/strong. The problem is I want it to be one key and I want this key to be specific "strongright cmd/strong". Previously I used PuntoSwitcher to switch layout by cmd press but it works for left and right cmd and this is not behaviour I expecting.   Also, I tried to use betterTouchTool, but i cannot make 1 key shortcut there.  Is there any way to achieve this behaviour?  <answer240473> Sadly I did a lot of research on the modifier keys for OS X a while ago, and you cannot differentiate left and right cmd modifiers. However the keybind normally for changing keyboard configuration is cmd-control-space for myself. Thats the normal configuration to select the next input source.  This is kind of like the annoying fn modifier that has no use but Functions 1-12. But that can be fixed with software.  Would have posted as comment, but I can't post commends yet.   edit: Oh, and shortcuts always require two key presses. A modifier and a primary. Otherwise things wouldn't operate quite normally if you understand what I mean. Such as allowing an [a-z] key to be launching an app.
