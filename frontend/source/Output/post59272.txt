AFP transfer speed seems to drop to nothing for no reason - Assistance to diagnose please? <body> I have an server that is running 10.5 and for some reason the speed of AFP transfers when serving around 30 clients drops to 300KB/s. This is really unusable, but I can seem to determine why this happens.  There are times when it is happily chugging along at 7MB/s and of course at that time everyone is happy. I do not use portable home directories, although I am holding off doing this because the server is so slow - I've deployed a NAS and linked that to my OD to use instead.  What I would really like to discover is "Is there a reason that causes AFP to hang the way it does" and if so how can I fix it.
