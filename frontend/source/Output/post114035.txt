No songs on itunes when ipod is disconnected <body> I didn't have such problem with the previous version of itunes, however after upgrading it to version 11, I can't get to access my songs after unplugging my iPod. In the past though I'd still manage to listen to songs synched on my iPod via itunes, but now after I unplug my iPod the songs disappear from itunes and I can't access them till I plug back my iPod.     Any ideas on how can I fix this?
