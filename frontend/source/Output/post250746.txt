iPhone 5 no longer responding to touch <body> My iPhone 5 touchscreen is not responding to touch! Last night, my phone was working just fine. I plugged it in overnight to charge, and when I checked my phone this morning, the touchscreen had broken.  Here's what's going wrong now:  ul liThe touchscreen isn't responding (I can't slide to unlock), though the screen emis/em on./li liThere are a bunch of lines on the screen, which disappear after the phone stays on for a few seconds or when I click the sleep/wake button./li /ul  The power button and home button are working as they should, I just can't get past the lock screen because I can't swipe to unlock (it's not registering the swipe or any taps).  What can I do to fix this?  <answer250894> I would recommend bringing the phone into your local Apple Store or using the official Apple repair site to send it in.  Sometimes, even when there is no obvious cause for screen damage, it can still happen somehow. This happened to a previous phone that I owned, I sent it in and the screen was replaced, fixing the problem.  <answer294779> My iphone 5s touch screen stopped working. It did work again after a while for like 5h and then stopped for good.  I decided to put it in a ziplock bag, get a bit of the air out and then I put it in the freezer for about 1-2h. Before I put it in the freezer the battery was at 7% then when I took it out 1% and it shut down.  I had it on charge for 1h but it didn't want to open at all so I took it out and left it till I woke up in the morning. I opened it , it was at about 47% battery and the touch screen was working and it still works (3rd day).  <comment311496> Try restarting your iPhone. Also, please clear up your language, we can't understand you! Comment back with `@JohnRamos` if that doesn't fix it. <comment311507> (Ok, I edited the question)
