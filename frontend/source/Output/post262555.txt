Mac logs out after not being used for awhile <body> After not using my mac for awhile, my account always logs out and closing  all the apps - it's quite annoying. Where can I disable this?  I have checked the setting under codeSystem Preferences &gt; Security &amp; Privacy &gt; General &gt; Advanced/code  and the 'Log out' checkbox is not checked.  I can't figure out what other settings is causing this.   <comment328926> Can you please provide more details. What version of macOS are you running? What model of Mac are you using? Does this happen at any time of day, or only at specific times? Is it always after the same amount of idle time? <comment328930> Also consider looking at `System Preferences  Energy` settings. Are you certain that it is logging out, and not restarting automatically on a freeze? Also, check your Console for any status or error messages that might appear around the time of the log out.
