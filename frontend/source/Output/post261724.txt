How to make autocorrect to correct "i" to "I" <body> "i" in english is always "I". Is there a preference to emautocorrect/em that auto corrects  small "i" to capital "I" in macOS?  <answer261725> Try System Preferences/Keyboard/Text/  check Capitalize Words Automatically  (Only available starting with Sierra)  <answer281653> Just type small "L" , it is as same as l   <answer281699> More specifically if you just want to capitalize the i as a word, in System Preferences  Keyboard  Text... add i to the replace column and I (capitalized) to the With column. It will capitalize i written by itself, but leaves it if it's within a word.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2SNrO.png" alt="Replace i with capital i"   (This only works in Sierra.  El Capitan and I think earlier versions require 2 characters to create a text shortcut.)  <comment327754> You said "_'i' in english is always 'I'._" **and that's just not a true statement!** The 9th letter of the modern English alphabet is used in both uppercase and a lowercase form depending on where and how it's being used. Setting an auto-correct to always change from lower case to upper case seems a bit ridiculous, unless you never type a word that isn't starting a sentence, is not a proper noun and doesn't contain the 9th letter of the modern English alphabet in any position other the first character. <comment327793> @user3439894 I think it's fairly obvious they mean "i" as a word. <comment327794> That will also capitalize the first word of a sentence, which you may or may not want. <comment327797> @user3439894 you should delete that comment, it is a nutty interpretation of the question.  It is really odd for a mac user to not see what is intended here. <comment327798> @timothymh  You mean the first letter, right?  If you have examples of when that's not helpful, I can add it to the answer. <comment327828> Yes, that is an [accepted meaning](https://cl.ly/iBGM) of the word. I often prefer to type in lowercase when in informal settings, such as iMessages, Skype, and other internet chats. <comment354382> it might look the same but the underlying code is totally different and it would be foolish to use this fix for anything other than printing something right away on paper. <comment354387> The letter `L`, written in lower case is `l` and is not at all the same as an `i` written in upper case i.e. `I`. Shown together, `lI`, you can plainly see they are not the same! <comment354537> I have Sierra installed, so I can't confirm that it works in previous versions, but I know this text replacement feature has been there for a long time. Here's an article referring to text replacement in [El Capitan](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH21555). As for words ending in "i", I typed this sentence in all lowercase in the Notes app: " I went down the mississippi in the river boat. " It capitalized the first "I" automatically and left all others alone. Another example, Minnie and I. It knew to capitalize the last i and leave the others alone. <comment354539> An undesirable situation would be writing dialogue: "How are you?" he said. That setting causes "He" to be capitalized. <comment354540> Why did this answer get the bounty? lol <comment354624> Hey Tom. Do you have any references for the 2 character minimum requirement? I can't find it in any documentation. <comment354674> It's not in any apple docs that I have found, but my El Capitan pops up error messages for single characters and spaces, and I remember from answering other questions like this that the problem was not solvable via these settings before Sierra <comment354977> @user3439894 Actually with the Helvetica font which Apple uses as the default for Mail, Notes, TextEdit, Pages, etc, these two letters do look the same, [see here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/PQdL1.png)
