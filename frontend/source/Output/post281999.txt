join multiple png images <body> Often I find myself needing to take many PNG images and join them into a larger image.  Specifically, in this particular case, I'd like to take 2 PNGs of roughly equal width (Â±2px) and different heights and create a new PNG where the first is above the other. E.g.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8iEV3.png" alt="enter image description here"  The join should be seamless.  Is there a command line tool/app that does this? Best would be if Preview offers a solution.  <answer282013> ImageMagick can do this:  precodeconvert 1.png 2.png -append result.png /code/pre  Alignment options can be specified using the code-gravity/code switch,  ul licode-gravity East/code align the right edges/li licode-gravity West/code align the left edges/li licode-gravity center/code align the centers/li /ul  <comment355001> [`sips`](https://developer.apple.com/legacy/library/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/sips.1.html) is the closest thing I know of, but I don't think this'll do what you want. Anything wrong with using a photo editing program like GIMP? <comment355002> @JMY1000 I'm hoping there's a native method or some simple one-liner terminal script. Using GIMP to do this simple task takes forever (starting up GIMP, creating new image of correct dimensions, pasting in the two PNGs.) Maybe there's a specialist app that isn't native to macOS, I wouldn't mind installing it if there was. <comment355004> Fair enough. Not aware of anything off the top of my head. <comment355018> In your OP you said, "Best would be if Preview offers a solution.", Preview doesn't have that functionality and neither does `sips` as mention in the comments. In your comment you said, "I'm hoping there's a native method or some simple one-liner terminal script", there is no native method that I know of, but that does't mean there isn't. The third-party app ImageMagic has a `montage` command to create a composite image by combining several separate images. You might have to first rotate the images using some other command of ImageMagic, or `sips`. Can't say for sure as I've not used it. <comment355028> @user3439894 I already have ImageMagick installed, I'll look into the montage command. :) <comment355091> +1 for coming back to share that ImageMagick could do this and how you did it. :)
