Terminal command ls/cd not finding any files on external harddrive <body> I'm having a bit of trouble with my external hdd and terminal. I've been able to access files on it via terminal in the past, but since I upgraded to El Capitan I can't seem to find anything on my external hdd. I can navigate through it and use stuff from it fine using Finder.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1p7Ei.png" alt="can see things fine using finder"  But then when I try to find anything using Terminal:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Bg0Ip.png" alt="terminal"  I'm really confused here — this has never happened before. Any ideas?  edit: did ls -l /Volumes:  precodelrwxr-xr-x   1 root  admin    1 Oct  4 22:05 Macintosh HD -&gt; / drwx------+  2 Shan  admin   68 Oct 11 17:29 ShanStore drwxrwxr-x  17 Shan  staff  646 Oct 29 21:41 ShanStore 1 /code/pre  Not sure why it's showing two external hdds — I only have the one  <answer214508> For whatever reason, the drive got mounted/attached under code/Volumes/ShanStore 1/code. The number will not be shown in Finder but codebash/code (in Terminal) is a bit more strict here.  To fix:  ul liUnmount/eject the drive in Finder und shut down the drive/li liRun codesudo rmdir /Volumes/ShanStore /Volumes/ShanStore\ 1/code (you'll probably get an error message about a non-existing code/Volumes/ShanStore\ 1/code, which is ok)/li liRun codels -l /Volumes/code to (hopefully) see code/Volumes/ShanStore/code gone/li liRestart the drive again/li /ul  <comment259032> Can you add the output of `ls -l /Volumes`? And you don't have to add screenshots, just copy/paste from Terminal is enough (and easier to read for people on mobile devices) <comment259033> I added an edit to the original post with the output. Thanks for the response! <comment259034> Now try `ls /Volumes/ShanStore\ 1/Main` :-) <comment259035> Can you post the cmd + i screenshot of Shan? <comment259036> Works like a charm, thank you very much!
