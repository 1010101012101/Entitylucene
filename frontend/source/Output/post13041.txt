Can't change Google Chrome icon <body> For every other application package I've looked at, there's a Paste option available in Edit menu after selecting the icon in "Get Info" dialog. For Google Chrome, there isn't.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0VjlO.jpg" alt="Google Chrome Info"  Why is that (i.e. is Chrome blocking the change somehow)? How can I get around this and change the icon? I'm sure there are apps for handling this, is there a way to do it without one?  <answer13042> Right click on the package, "show package content", then go in the "ressources" folder and change the icon there. The icon file is the code.icns/code file.  <answer281656> ul li"Show Package Contents", Contents, Resources/li liReplace app.icns with a new icon set/li liGo to a Terminal and do codetouch /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app//code and codekillall Dock/code/li /ul  Voilà  <comment13720> Thanks. Could you be please more specific on how and what to change? I've figured it out, but your answer seems incomplete this way. <comment13721> Like that or more ? <comment13722> By the way, I had to remove Chrome from Dock and put it back there to make the new icon appear in Dock (finder showed new icon right after I've changed the icns file). <comment13723> More, I guess, mention what icns files are there, how to edit them perhaps? <comment13735> Because of how Chrome updates, you will have to do this over and over again. Each time it pushes an update to you, it overwrites the old icon too. <comment13756> @Martin you will always have to do that anyway, or in the terminal type: "killall Dock" to restart the Dock, because it keeps a cached copy of the icon. <comment13763> @Martín I see! `killall` is easier than replacing the app in dock, thanks. <comment354386> `touch app` was the magic command thank you!
