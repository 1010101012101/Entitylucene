Interpreting constant kernal panic <body> I have very frequent kernel panic calls.  Here is a report on one of them.  I have no idea what is causing it.      precodeFri Jun 27 11:21:45 2014 panic(cpu 1 caller 0xffffff7fad305f7c): "GPU Panic: [&lt;None&gt;] 3 0 a0 d9 9 8 0 3 : NVRM[0/1:0:0]: Read Error 0x00000100: CFG 0xffffffff 0xffffffff 0xffffffff, BAR0 0x102c00000 0xffffff813c9b8000 0x0e7150a2, D0, P3/4\n"@/SourceCache/AppleGraphicsControl/AppleGraphicsControl-3.5.26/src/AppleMuxControl/kext/GPUPanic.cpp:127 Backtrace (CPU 1), Frame : Return Address […]       Kernel Extensions in backtrace:          com.apple.iokit.IOGraphicsFamily(2.4.1)[B889D3AB-CCC0-3FCD-A83E-D2E3E4CB537B]@0xffffff7fab95b000-&gt;0xffffff7fab992fff             dependency: com.apple.iokit.IOPCIFamily(2.9)[244D4E48-78E6-3369-8D76-285C66EF9BF4]@0xffffff7fab6be000          com.apple.driver.AppleMuxControl(3.5.26)[B67CD59F-1344-37BC-8A9A-46D6D3DCA13D]@0xffffff7fad2f7000-&gt;0xffffff7fad30afff             dependency: com.apple.driver.AppleGraphicsControl(3.5.26)[C0F9A79F-167E-3A68-873C-5CE17B97FB11]@0xffffff7fad2ef000             dependency: com.apple.iokit.IOACPIFamily(1.4)[045D5D6F-AD1E-36DB-A249-A346E2B48E54]@0xffffff7fac2f2000             dependency: com.apple.iokit.IOPCIFamily(2.9)[244D4E48-78E6-3369-8D76-285C66EF9BF4]@0xffffff7fab6be000             dependency: com.apple.iokit.IOGraphicsFamily(2.4.1)[B889D3AB-CCC0-3FCD-A83E-D2E3E4CB537B]@0xffffff7fab95b000             dependency: com.apple.driver.AppleBacklightExpert(1.0.4)[E04639C5-D734-3AB3-A682-FE66694C6653]@0xffffff7fad2f2000          com.apple.nvidia.driver.NVDAResman(8.2.6)[DB59C243-61DE-3B0C-86C3-6D89446F6F14]@0xffffff7fab9b4000-&gt;0xffffff7fabc27fff             dependency: com.apple.iokit.IOPCIFamily(2.9)[244D4E48-78E6-3369-8D76-285C66EF9BF4]@0xffffff7fab6be000             dependency: com.apple.iokit.IONDRVSupport(2.4.1)[B93BBFC9-9ED5-3DDD-8CED-5EDA081BB997]@0xffffff7fab99e000             dependency: com.apple.iokit.IOGraphicsFamily(2.4.1)[B889D3AB-CCC0-3FCD-A83E-D2E3E4CB537B]@0xffffff7fab95b000             dependency: com.apple.AppleGraphicsDeviceControl(3.5.26)[E971FED4-805F-3462-9D93-1919EBE3DC82]@0xffffff7fab9ae000          com.apple.nvidia.driver.NVDAGK100Hal(8.2.6)[AE5D65B5-1E26-3509-97B9-C68D97C21143]@0xffffff7fabc33000-&gt;0xffffff7fabddffff             dependency: com.apple.nvidia.driver.NVDAResman(8.2.6)[DB59C243-61DE-3B0C-86C3-6D89446F6F14]@0xffffff7fab9b4000             dependency: com.apple.iokit.IOPCIFamily(2.9)[244D4E48-78E6-3369-8D76-285C66EF9BF4]@0xffffff7fab6be000  BSD process name corresponding to current thread: WindowServer  Mac OS version: 13D65  Kernel version: Darwin Kernel Version 13.2.0: Thu Apr 17 23:03:13 PDT 2014; root:xnu2422.100.13~1/RELEASE_X86_64 Kernel UUID: ADD73AE6-88B0-32FB-A8BB-4F7C8BE4092E Kernel slide:     0x000000002ae00000 Kernel text base: 0xffffff802b000000 System model name: MacBookPro10,1 (Mac-C3EC7CD22292981F)  System uptime in nanoseconds: 3525601653  last loaded kext at 3285490337: com.apple.filesystems.autofs    3.0 (addr 0xffffff7faca77000, size 45056) loaded kexts: […] /code/pre  <answer136367> Lets try to narrow it down.  ul liStart in Safe mode (hold shift) to exclude the GPU and 3d party/li liUse Apple Hardware Test (hold D) to check for problems/li liReset your NVRAM/li lilast not least reinstall osx/li /ul  <comment161732> This is going to need an edit to be readable. Please compose a short sentence at the beginning to explain what you know or don't know about kernel panics (search here - there are several great explanations of the basics) and what you want to accomplish. Then paste the panic text and embed it as a code sample to avoid posting lines and lines of unformatted output. <comment161733> See http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1418/can-someone-help-me-read-this-crash-report-as-a-user for an example of the edit that would make this helpful to us to help you. Also http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/95764/how-i-can-read-macbook-crash-report <comment161750> @bmike  I tried to edit most of the irrelevant information out. In this case I would say it is the Nvida making the problem. Starting in Safe mode would prove that. <comment161755> @Buscar웃 Good first stab. In the future, don't call out edits to the text - just make the post read clearly. Like when a professional editor edits a novel. You only read the result - not the deltas. The system tracks edits if people want to know why / why an edit was made. Let's see what the OP needs when they edit it for what they want to have happen... <comment161770> @Ryan I've attempted to fix the formatting of the panic log, but if I've done it wrong please feel free to edit further. <comment161776> Thank you all, is the formatting better now? <comment161777> Hey, for those interested, it appears to be an issue with the external graphics card. Forcing and keeping the laptop using the integrated card appears to be working.. Workaround until i can stomach the logic board replacement.. You can download gfxCardStatus to manually switch over to the integrated card.
