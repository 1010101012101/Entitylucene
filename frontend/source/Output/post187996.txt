Can launchd be made to set a different owner on files it creates while executing a .plist job? <body> I have a launchctl .plist file in /Library/LaunchDaemons as follows:  pre class="lang-xml prettyprint-override"code&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;david.ports.slocate.home.updatedb&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;array&gt;         &lt;string&gt;/opt/local/bin/slocate&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;string&gt;-U&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;string&gt;/Users/david&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;string&gt;-o&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;string&gt;/Users/david/slocate_david.db&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;/array&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Umask&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;077&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;key&gt;StartCalendarInterval&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;dict&gt;         &lt;key&gt;Hour&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;integer&gt;5&lt;/integer&gt;         &lt;key&gt;Minute&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;integer&gt;45&lt;/integer&gt;     &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  For those who are wondering, I use the slocate port from MacPorts instead of the native locate database that ships with OS X.  This .plist job updates the slocate database specific to my home directory at 5:45 AM daily.  The Umask setting of 077 makes the output file readable only by me.  However, the file is created with the ownership of root; not what I want.  Is there a way to specify the ownership of the output file instead of the default of root?  I realize I can run this as a LaunchAgent under ~/Library/LaunchAgents, but I prefer the job to run whether I am logged in or not, hence installing it as a LaunchDaemon.  I'm running OS X 10.10.3 Yosemite.  <answer187997> Instead of code/Library/LaunchDaemons/code use the user based code~/Library/LaunchAgents/code in your user library. Then the process will be executed as the logged in user, instead of the root account.  <answer188012> I have a few suggestions. According to to the manual, you can set the UserName key- https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man5/launchd.plist.5.html. You could use periodic with a shell script to run slocate and change the permissions of the database. Setup a user crontab. A user crontab will only run at the specified time.  <comment222390> I prefer the job to run whether I am logged in or not.  I figure since LaunchDaemons run as root, they would be able to change the owner of files they create.  If that is not the case, what I will probably do instead is create another LaunchDaemon to change the ownership of that file and have it run well after the previous one completes.  Wish there were a more elegant solution than that.  Thanks for answering. <comment222393> Actually, no, the strategy in my previous comment won't work, because both jobs will run when the computer boots or wakes up past the scheduled run time.  Instead, on the second job, I will use StartInterval 300 or something to simply chown that file every 5 minutes.  Still inelegant. <comment222406> Setting the UserName key fixed it.  I can't believe I didn't see that or that it didn't occur to me.  I was looking for chown when I could have been looking for process owner.  Thank you.  I set this as correct answer.  Will upvote you when I have enough reputation. <comment222409> someone who knows the topic well :) a + from me
