iOS Podcast stops playing random time/place <body> I commute daily, and listen to Podcasts / iBooks to calm the nerves of traffic. Once I get in my car and put the earphones in, iOS suggest that I play my podcasts (this is annoying, but ok - so I tap play). Half way home, my podcast would just stop abruptly, and I'll have to physically open the app again and hit play on the podcast. The same happens when I'm doing audiobooks.  I cannot figure out if this is a location based problem (it feels that way) - however I cannot find any setting that's related to this.  Have anybody any insight into what this might be?  <comment306139> Are you sure you're using **downloaded** podcasts/books and not using **streaming** instead? <comment306416> Yup that was my first thoughts as well - but I checked that and it's fully downloaded episodes :/
