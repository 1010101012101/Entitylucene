Waterlogged iPod Touch <body> A few years back, I accidentally jumped in the pool with my third gen iPod touch still in my pocket. I placed it in rice for a while, and it started working again, but the screen was extremely dull. Every day after that that I used it, the screen steadily got worse and worse to the point where I couldn't even tell what the background was anymore. Since then, it has sat untouched. I plugged it in today, and the screen is static-y and grey and indistinguishable. It still functions, but I can only tell due to my own memory. Is it worth anything? If not, where could I properly dispose of it?  <answer99985> Are you interested in purchasing a new iPod Touch? If so, you could check out Apple's Recycling Program.  strongFrom Apple's website,/strong     Bring your old iPod to an Apple Retail Store and receive a 10 percent   discount on the purchase of a new iPod.*   I'm not exactly sure if you would qualify due to its screen, but it is definitely worth a shot. Take it an Apple Store and see if they will give you 10 percent off.  strongFrom an Apple Discussion Board,/strong     ... you can throw it away, bury it, smash it, take it to Apple as   recycling, use it as a paperweight, leave it in a drawer, etc.   h2Update/h2  I just checked on Newton's Head, and they will offer you code$5.50/code for an iPod Touch 3rd Generation, water-damaged with all original accessories.  So, it's not going to be worth that much.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xbBZJ.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment117688> Thanks. If the offer is that low, I may just take it to one of my local Target stores and recycle it there. Thanks again.
