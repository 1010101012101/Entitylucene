What does a darker grey arrow in finder represent? <body> I use Finder with the 'view as list' setting. Today I noticed that one of my folders had a darker grey arrow next to it than all the others:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YKr8u.png" alt="enter image description here"  (The codenotes/code folder is the one with the darker arrow)  I then took a copy of the folder to see if the copy would also have the dark arrow, but it jumped to a different folder! (now codetests_and_trials/code)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6Wb0t.png" alt="enter image description here"  I closed and reopened the finder window, and all the arrows were light grey with no dark grey arrows at all.  What was going on?  (This is on OS X 10.9)  <answer126108> This is simply a glitch. The darkened triangle is used when the button is pressed. It doesn't emmean/em anything about the folder and will be fixed by closing and re-opening the window as you discovered.
