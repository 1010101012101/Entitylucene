Can I mix Apple stock RAM with OWC RAM? <body> I have an iMac that shipped with 16GB RAM (using 2 out of 4 slots). I ordered two 16GB RAM modules from OWC. Instead of just replacing the RAM, can I actually add the OWC RAM to what's already in there? Will this cause problems, mixing the two brands?  <answer246592> Yes it will work, although it's always better to have the same latency and MHz kits.  <comment304222> It should work, **IF** your Mac supports 48GB of RAM. Some do some don't best to check the specs on Apple.com to see. But putting them in to see shouldn't cause any issues. <comment304277> I think he means: "Could I just bought 1x 16gb module to add to my existing 16gb to get 32gb?". So he wouldn't need to **replace** his current 16gb with OWC module. I might be wrong..
