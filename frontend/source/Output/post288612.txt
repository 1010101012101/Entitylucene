How can I print with the best possible quality using AirPrint from iOS to a Canon Pixma MG7750 printer? <body> My wife uses the Pages application on her iPhone and iPad to write documents with embeded photos.  When I try to print them - in 90% of cases, the images contain smudges. Quality control is very simple (like color and pages nr).  When I generate a PDF through iCloud/Pages and print the same document in Linux or Windows, print quality is at least good (Linux) or very good (Windows). This means the problem isn't with the printer, but in iOS.  On the iPhone I installed the Canon app, but if I select 'Print Document', the Pages documents are greyed out and not selectable.  When I login on the printer I can't find any more detailed quality control settings. Changing any of the settings that are available makes no improvement, and in some cases even results in more ink drops.  strongMy question is:/strong How can I print with the best possible quality from within iOS?
