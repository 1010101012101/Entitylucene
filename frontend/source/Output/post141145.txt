Connect automatically to VPN when connecting to wifi access point? <body> Is it possible to automatically connect to a VPN when one is connected to a WIFI access point?  To manually connect to a VPN after connecting to a WIFI access point works, but it is so easy to forget.  I am using Mavericks on a Macbook Pro Retina.  <answer141444> h1ControlPlane/h1  You want to have an automated action after you connect to a certain WiFi point. An easy way to do this, is using ControlPlane (formally known as MarcoPolo). This software makes your computer context aware and can execute scripts and programs when your location changes. Some examples that ControlPlane is aware of:  ul liCurrent Audio Output device (headphones/internal speakers)/li liDiscoverable Bluetooth devices/li liAdvertised Bonjour (Zeroconf) services/li liAttached FireWire devices/li liAssigned IP addresses/li liAmbient Light level/li liAttached Monitors/li liActive Network Links/li liPower source (power adapter/battery)/li liRunning Applications/li liCurrent Time Of Day/li liAttached USB devices/li liVisible WiFi networks/li /ul  strongedit/strong (21 aug 2014, thanks to @Rainer): Marcopolo is now ControlPlane. ControlPlane was created using code from version 2.5.1 of the MarcoPolo project still available at http://www.symonds.id.au/marcopolo/.  ControlPlane is a direct port of MarcoPolo and in fact, much of the configuration from MarcoPolo still works with ControlPlane, just better!  ControlPlane supports 32 and 64bit Intel based Macs running Snow Leopard through Lion.  <comment167993> That's an idea! But it seems that Marcopolo is  it maintained anymore and the author suggests using controlplne instead  http://www.controlplaneapp.com/ I will look at it again. Thanks. <comment168040> Ok - got it working with using ControlPlane, Tunnelblick for the VPN connection and AppleScript to connect and disconnect the VPN. <comment330892> @Rainer can you post that script? <comment330893> Sorry - Not usine it anymore and lost it. <comment373520> The applescript to connect to Tunnelblick  `tell application "Tunnelblick"  connect ("pfwtracs01-udp-1194-config") end tell`
