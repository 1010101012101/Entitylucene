Disable Continuity with iMessages.app <body> I have a work Macbook Pro and do not want to use iMessages.app at all to sync to my phone. When I open up the Messages application on my iPhone, Continuity tries to handoff the application to the OSX machine on the same wifi. However, I want to completely disable iMessages.app syncing to this computer. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9R5e8.png" alt="iMessages.app Continuity Popup"  I have disabled:  (On iPhone)-Settings-Phone-'Calls on other Devices' [Off]  (On MBP)-iMessages.app- No Accounts setup  Is there a way to disable this iMessages Continuity integration?   <answer227221> If you want to disable iMessage to be synced with your iPhone:  ul liOn iPhone -- Settings  Messages  Text Message Forwarding  Remove your MBP device that should appear./li liOn MBP -- No account setups is ok (double check if your iCloud account has already been disabled)./li /ul  Finally, you can definitively get rid of Handoff by unchecking "Handoff" in iPhone  Settings  General  Handoff &amp; Suggested Apps.  <comment276010> Thank you. It was the 'Handoff' setting on the phone, which seems to be a proxy for 'Continuity Enabled'. I turned that off and all application handoffs are disabled via continuity.
