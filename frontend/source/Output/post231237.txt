How to properly and for once reinstall PHP/Apache <body> So I'm struggeling with this since a long time and I'd like to find a proper solution.  I have php5.4.. install and I want to upgrade to Php 7.  No matter how hard I'm trying to do it I can't seems to touch my goal. I tried to remove php54 and other with homebrew, to remove it manually by command line, to overwrite it with new version nothing work. What ever Im doing when I type codephp -v/code I always end up with php5.4 :  precodeMarjorie:~ Mawel$ php -v PHP 5.4.45 (cli) (built: Sep  6 2015 20:56:23)  Copyright (c) 1997-2014 The PHP Group Zend Engine v2.4.0, Copyright (c) 1998-2014 Zend Technologies /code/pre  So I'm asking my self have I messed up with my php/apache conf ? Shall I try a clean-install of my system and would it be efficient ? I don't know ! I'm kinda lost and really need some help even for comprehension (is there a reason I can't get rid of old php version ?)  Anything would be helpful   h2Edit/h2  So here is more information for answering the questions :   Output of codebrew tap/code  precodeMarjorie:~ Mawel$ brew tap homebrew/dupes homebrew/php homebrew/versions /code/pre  As of what I've tried with home brew :  So here is step by step the idea :   precodebrew remove php54 brew install php70 brew link php70 Warning: Already linked: /usr/local/Cellar/php70/7.0.4 /code/pre  Lets add this information :   precodeMarjorie:~ Mawel$ sudo find ~/ -iname "php" /Users/Mawel//Code/agencedevoyage/sos-partenaire/vendor/phpunit/php-code-coverage/tests/PHP /Users/Mawel//Code/agencedevoyage/sos-partenaire/vendor/phpunit/phpunit/src/Util/PHP /Users/Mawel//Code/agencedevoyage/vendor/phpunit/php-code-coverage/tests/PHP /Users/Mawel//Code/agencedevoyage/vendor/phpunit/phpunit/src/Util/PHP /Users/Mawel//Code/PHP /Users/Mawel//Code/Site Perso/dev/vendor/phpunit/php-code-coverage/tests/PHP /Users/Mawel//Code/Site Perso/dev/vendor/phpunit/phpunit/src/Util/PHP /Users/Mawel//Documents/Cours/BTS SIO/Developpement/PHP /Users/Mawel//Documents/Cours/BTS SIO/Developpement/web/php /Users/Mawel//Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Cache/PHP /Users/Mawel//Library/Enthought/Canopy_64bit/User/lib/python2.7/site-packages/IPython/html/static/components/codemirror/mode/php /code/pre  And finally, my bash profile :  precodeMarjorie:~ Mawel$ vi ~/.bash_profile  alias composer="php /usr/local/bin/composer.phar" PATH="/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH" export PATH export PATH=~/.composer/vendor/bin:$PATH export PATH="/usr/local/mysql/bin:$PATH"  source ~/.profile /code/pre  <answer231315> The codebrew/code commands look ok. You have all the taps you need.br First of all since you're working with homebrew, I'd suggest the following two commands (let's start clean):  precodebrew update &amp;&amp; brew cleanup /code/pre  So we're sure that we're using the latest homebrew release and we cleanup all old formulas and leftovers.  From your codePATH/code it looks like codeusr/bin/code (which is the standard Mac OS X path for binaries and executables) comes before codeusr/local/bin/code (the path in which homebrew links the Cellar).br As you might know, Mac OS X when looking for binaries/executables scans the codePATH/code from top to bottom so if both codeusr/bin/code and codeusr/local/bin/code have the codephp/code executables, since codeusr/bin/code comes first in codePATH/code, then Mac OS X will use the codephp/code version in such folder, ignoring the version in codeusr/local/bin/code (which, as instead, is our target).    To make sure regarding which version Mac OS X is using, type in the Terminal  precodewhich php /code/pre  and if the output is codeusr/bin/code, then Mac OS X is using its own version.   The core indeed now is to change the codePATH/code order in codebash_profile/code, and make sure that codeusr/local/bin/code comes before codeusr/bin/code (it is clear now that we're forcing Mac OS X to use the homebrew version).  Once the changes have been done, restart your Mac and type in the Terminal  precodeecho $PATH /code/pre  This will display the entire codePATH/code list so you can make sure everything's in the right order.br Now, finally, you can check using either  precodewhich php /code/pre  or  precodephp -v /code/pre  which is the running version.  <comment282369> Calm down mate :) First of all tell us what brew commands have you tried and `brew list` which php version gives you <comment282370> Also, what's the output for `brew tap`? <comment282445> @Alessiox Edited my post <comment282451> Since you're working with homebrew, first of all I'd suggest to `brew update` and `brew cleanup` to remove older formula versions and leftovers/cache. Then in your `PATH` try putting `usr/local/bin` (where brew links stuff) before `usr/bin` (the apple standard) <comment282452> if you type `which pip` I reckon the Terminal will print `/usr/bin/php`, which is the Mac OS X standard (pre-installed) PHP release <comment282453> `Marjorie:~ Mawel$ which pip` `/Users/Mawel/Library/Enthought/Canopy_64bit/User/bin/pip`  And did everything else but no amelioration <comment282455> dude I'm so sorry. Not `which pip` but `which php`. I got confused, Canopy is indeed python-related and so is `pip` <comment282468> Haha indeed I was asking my self too :) So here you got it : `Marjorie:~ Mawel$ which php` `/usr/bin/php` <comment282469> As you can see the default `php` is not the homebrew `php` but the standard Mac OS X. Mac OS X as you might know, scans the `PATH` from top to bottom when looking for executables and binaries, so the `usr/local/bin` path (which is the homebrew path) should be at the top of the `PATH` (or, at least, before `usr/bin`. Try changing the `bash_profile` including the brew path at the top of the `PATH`, then restart and try again with `which pip` or `pip -v` and see if something changes. <comment282471> Your `PATH` definition is split in several lines, to make sure that the changes are ok, type in Terminal `echo $PATH`. This command will show the entire `PATH`, so you can easily check if `usr/local/bin` comes before `usr/bin` <comment282472> Well I've did it and restarted Apache I restart the whole computeur in a sec <comment282473> Great It works !! So it was all about `PATH`  Post answer below and I accept it ;) <comment318421> Superb answer. Thanks!
