macOS Sierra doesn't appear in my Purchased list within the Mac App Store <body> Typically, when users download and/or upgrade to a new version or macOS (previously Mac OS X), via the Mac App Store, that version of the installer appears in the strongPurchased/strong tab of the App Store app.  Below is an example of how this appears (I've added arrows to highlight the macOS installations):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Lzen4.png" alt="enter image description here"  However, users are reporting that they do not see the macOS Sierra installer in their list of purchased items. Signing out and back into the App Store does not resolve this issue.  strongQuestions/strong  ol liHow do users get their previously downloaded macOS Sierra installation to appear in the list?/li liHow can users ensure that macOS Sierra (or later versions of macOS) are available to them when newer versions of macOS are released?/li /ol  <answer286312> The download of macOS Sierra is strongnot linked to an Apple ID/strong. In fact, users can download it without having to sign into the Mac App Store.  Another recent change made by Apple is the inclusion of an additional macOS Recovery option. Instead of two, we now have three options:  ul likbdcommand/kbdkbdR/kbd to reinstall the stronglatest macOS that was installed/strong on your Mac, without upgrading to a later version /li likbdoption/kbdkbdcommand/kbdkbdR/kbd to upgrade to the stronglatest macOS that is compatible/strong with your Mac/li likbdshift/kbdkbdoption/kbdkbdcommand/kbdkbdR/kbd to reinstall the strongmacOS that came with your Mac/strong, or the version emclosest/em to it that is still availablesup1/sup/li /ul  sup1/sup That third option is a new option only available since 27 March 2017 and requires macOS Sierra 10.12.4.  The result of these changes is that in future, if you need to install a compatible version of macOS that is earlier than the one that is emstill available/em, you will need to have a copy of the installer.   In summary, if you wish to have a version of macOS available for possible future installation, it is recommended that you download and store the relevant installer so that it is available to you. You donâ€™t need to install it to do this, you can download it via the Mac App Store and then quit the installer when it launches. You can then make a copy of it for future use.
