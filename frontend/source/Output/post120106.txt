How can I make the icon of a folder to be a given .icns file? <body> I have a code.icns/code file. I want to make the icon of folder to be this code.icns/code.  How can I make that?  hr  h2EDIT/h2  The code.icns/code file that I use does not have the code.icns/code file as its icon.   I have tried to copy the code.icns/code file in codePreview/code and paste it to the icon, but it copies the code1024x1024/code image.  <answer120107> Open the code.png/code file in Preview (or convert image to png) or open code.icns/code in Preview  Press kbdcommand/kbd+kbdA/kbd to select the entire image  Press kbdcommand/kbd+kbdC/kbd to copy the selection  kbdControl/kbd+Click on the file/folder you would like to change and "Get information"  Click the icon (so there is a blue frame around it)  Press kbdcommand/kbd+kbdV/kbd to paste the image into that.  *Sometimes you can go straight from the Get Info window of the code.icns/code and copy the image icon there into the Get Info of the item you want to change. This works for most Apps except Finder.  <answer120559> ol li"Get Info" of the folder you want the icon to be replaced,/li liusing Finder, drag and drop the *.icns file to the current strongtop/strong, i.e. smaller icon of the folder in the "Get Info" window./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wLr2b.png" alt="example"  <answer120611> I had this problem myself and the only solution I found was to use Cocoa:     [[NSWorkspace sharedWorkspace] setIcon:image forFile:filePath options:0];  I've written a simple app that just asks for an icon, then a file or folder on which to apply that icon.

Mac OS is kick ass and so is Preview. Open the .icns in preview and copy it. It'll work <comment140249> I checked: it does not copy the `.icns`, it copies the `1024x1024` image. <comment140583> Or open the "Get Info" inspector (CMD + I) of the folder and the one of the icon. Click the icon copy it (CMD + C) and click the folder icon then paste the clipboard content (CMD + V). PS: You may paste any kind of image althought better to use a square image of at least 1024px and a format that includes transparency such as PNG. <comment140587> @llange Your method works only if the `.icns` file the `.icns` file as its icon, which is not the case for my file :( <comment140588> @piobyz Great, it works like a charm! <comment140597> I must have poorly explained myself, and I'm sorry for that (my apologies). If you have an "icns" file (icon) you may use the inspector on both files and copy paste (because some times drag and drop isn't convenient). If instead you have an other type of image copy the image (e.g.) from Preview.app : select all (CMD + A) copy (CMD + C) and paste the clipboard content to the folder inspector (the PS part of my previous comment). <comment140691> Have you checked @piobyz's answer? <comment140737> Well @piobyz's answer is certainly easier, thank.  I just take any opportunity to write an app :) <comment343964> Answers on Ask Different need to be more than just a link. It's okay to include a link, but please summarize or excerpt it in the answer. The idea is to make the answer stand alone.
