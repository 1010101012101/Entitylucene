iPad Air - How to type exclamation point from the exclamation/comma key <body> This has been bugging me for a while. While I see the exclamation point in the exclamation/comma key, there is no way to make that key type the exclamation point. What I am able to do with the key is to type comma and single quote with the key.   What am I missing? How can I make exclamation/comma key to type exclamation point.  <answer120218> h1Press ⇧,/h1  Press the kbd⇧/kbd shift key, then press the kbd,/kbd comma key, which will insert a code!/code.  hr  This also works for the question mark above the kbd./kbd  <comment140233> Works. Way the keyboard remembers the pressed state of shift key was confusing. If I delete character and backtracks and if shift is active in that state, it will not trigger the exclamation point. I have to turn off shift, and press again for this combo to work. <comment140238> I don't get your question...
