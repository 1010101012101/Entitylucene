Format SD card with FAT and custom file allocation unit size <body> I'm using Maverick (a offline mapping application) on my Android device which has thousands of files in the tile cache with a size of 168 byte. The SD card is formatted with a file allocation unit size of 32 KB. This results for each file in a huge waste of space:  precode168 Byte (33 KB on the volume) /code/pre  You can imagine that a 2GB is full even if you want to store 50MB of emreal/em data. Is there software I can use on my Mac to change the file allocation unit size during formatting of the device?  <answer44005> Open up a terminal and check out the following command:  precodeNAME      newfs_msdos -- construct a new MS-DOS (FAT) file system  SYNOPSIS      newfs_msdos [-N] [-B boot] [-F FAT-type] [-I volid] [-O OEM]                  [-S sector-size] [-a FAT-size] [-b block-size]                  [-c cluster-size] [-e dirents] [-f format] [-h heads]                  [-i info] [-k backup] [-m media] [-n FATs] [-o hidden]                  [-r reserved] [-s total] [-u track-size] [-v volume-name]                  special [disktype] /code/pre  In particular these parameters:  precode -S sector-size          Number of bytes per sector.  Acceptable values are powers of 2 in          the range 128 through 32768.   -a FAT-size          Number of sectors per FAT.   -b block-size          File system block size (bytes per cluster).  This should resolve          to an acceptable number of sectors per cluster (see below).   -c cluster-size          Sectors per cluster.  Acceptable values are powers of 2 in the          range 1 through 128. /code/pre  You should be able to perform a custom format with the options you need, obviously make sure you test this out thoroughly.  <answer44008> Stuffe has given the correct answer. For other users I want to add the steps to create the volume:  ul lidetermine the device node: codediskutil info /Volumes/NameOfVolume/code (/dev/disk1s1)/li liDeaktivate the Volume with disk-util/li liCreate new Volume: codenewfs_msdos -F 32 -v NameOfVolume -c 1 /dev/deisk1s1/code/li /ul  The cluster size code-c 1/code will create the size of 512 Byte   <comment50021> Great additions.
