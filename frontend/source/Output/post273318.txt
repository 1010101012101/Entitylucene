Music application missing from home screen on iOS <body> I have an iPhone 7. For some reason, the music application is missing from my home screen. I have tried resetting to home screen layout but the music app still doesn't show up. I can see my music when I go into manage storage but can't play it on the phone.  <answer273319> You have probably deleted it...br You can just reinstall it from the AppStore: https://appsto.re/us/-Jzdcb.i  <comment343571> Does the music app show up in settings normally? Are all the other apps ok?
