Numbers: How to make a sum product of 2 columns numbers of which only those with checkboxes checked in a 3rd column respectively? <body> Say, sumproduct(A, B)=a1*b1 + a2*b2 + a3*b3, now I have many columns C, D,..., e.g. c1 checked, c2 unchecked, c3 checked; d1 unchecked, d2 checked, d3 checked;  Now I need a formulae which I want to put in a cell of each of column C, D... to compute a conditional sum product to get a1*b1 + a3*b3 and a2*b2 + a3*b3 respectively.  This can be used in my nutrition calculation table of daily intake.  Thanks a lot.  <answer256046> You can add an additional column D, where D1 to D3 would contain:  precodeIF(C1,1,0) IF(C2,1,0) IF(C3,1,0) /code/pre  This would print a 1 if checked or a 0 if not checked, and you simply would need to add column D into your sumproduct:  precodea1*b1*c1 + a2*b2*c2 + a3*b3*c3 /code/pre  <comment324377> Thanks and sorry, I cannot accept this answer, I don't want introduce an auxiliary column. Actually, I have many columns C, D, E, F... all are with checkboxes..I need a conditional sum product formulae to compute and show the results for each column in a cell in the same column. <comment324381> Question revised. Thanks.
