OS X Ram Viewer <body> I am starting to become an intermediate C++ programmer and messing around with memory allocation and would like to take a look what is going on behind the scenes. For instance, I would like to see whats going on in the 0x7ff8ecaf7 region of emvirtual memory/em (correct me if I'm wrong) in the picture below. Is there a way to view the emvirtual memory/em contents of RAM in OS X? img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/I0QrE.png" alt="assembly dump"  <comment175147> The debugger will allow you to do that for your process <comment175149> You may want to read and understand the concepts behind virtual memory management.  It is not as simple as 'reading' the contents of RAM. Each process has a dedicated address space which the OS dynamically maps to physical resources. <comment175231> Here's Apple doc about virtual memory: https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Performance/Conceptual/ManagingMemory/Articles/AboutMemory.html <comment175239> you might want to be more specific in your title.
