How to update company's MacBook Pro with OS X Lion? <body> How a company I work for should update my MacBook Pro to Lion? I have some options but I'm unsure which way to go?  strongNote:/strong volume license is not an option (not that many Macs at my company).  ol liUpdate to Lion using my Apple ID and ask for reimbursement. Cons: not quite the right thing IMO as license is on myself then. Pro: pricing (€23.99)/li liAsk company to buy an USB stick with update. Pros: seems the easiest way. Cons: pricing is at €59.99, so the company may not be willing to go that way when the update is cheaper in App Store./li liMaybe a company can update via App Store by logging in with company's Apple ID?/li /ol  What you recommend? What's your experience?  <answer33878> The company should have an Apple ID set up. I would recommend that this is registered to a member of the IT team who is most responsible for software purchasing.  Then they can download OS X Lion from the app store, and have the license.  Is there a business requirement to be running Lion or is this user preference?   <comment38663> Who owns the computer and who will own the OS - you or the company you work for? <comment38665> @Mark: The company owns the MBP, so it will own the OS licence as well. Or maybe I can own the OS licence, but how I take it with me when e.g. I leave the company? <comment38672> It's both - a requirement and preference (mostly stay up to date with latest tools for iOS dev, productivity etc.). Anyway, I you're right about setting up AID for IT and run it through their dept. Thanks! <comment38673> No worries, that way they still handle everything, including any problems, if you get any.
