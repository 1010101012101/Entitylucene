Every browser seems slow on my Macbook. Also lot of fan noise <body> I've been working on this Mid 2015 MBP (i7, 16GB) for about 2 years now. Coming from Windows I feel like a lot of websites perform really badly on my Macbook. Especially noticeable on Javascript heavy websites and sites like Google Maps or websites where stuff if overlaid on Maps like for example www.zillow.com or similar type of sites.  At first I thought it was just Chrome, but I've tried Firefox just now and it's just as slow registering map movements, clicks etc. It also feels like it gets slower the longer you spent time on those websites.  Also my mac randomly starts creating a lot of fan noise whilst connected to my 4K monitor. I can see why if I'm running a game or watching a 4K movie, but not with just normal web browsing. When looking at the Activity Monitor I cannot see it doing anything strange or CPU/GPU intensive.  I never have any of these issues on my similar specced Windows 10 PC.  Does anyone recognize these symptoms and maybe have a fix? I already tried resetting the NVRAM and SMC etc. a while ago.  Cheers!  <comment374072> There are two separate questions here (should only be one) and  both of which are unclear becauses the premise for both is based on a perception (i.e "feels like") rather than verifiable data. <comment374075> Well it is slower and I think the two questions are related. <comment374076> That may be, but it's not what you wrote.  You didn't say the fans came on "while using your browser", you said they came on "while connected to a 4K monitor".  "Feels like it's slow" doesn't mean "it actually is slow. "  For example, have you tested this in Safari? <comment374077> Well, check that you have latest version of Java, or if you do not have it installed, may be you could try to install it (https://www.java.com/en/) and see if this will make any difference. Also, clean your Mac with free utility - Onyx (https://www.titanium-software.fr/en/onyx.html) <comment374085> Is it a 15" MBP? I think they can use the integrated GPU or a dedicated GPU. Have you accidentally disabled the dedicated GPU? This might explain why it feels slow in some circumstances. <comment374086> At what resolution do you use your 4K monitor? At the full 4K, or another, custom resolution? A custom resolution could result in macOS rendering the screen in an even higher resolution and then displaying it scaled, leading to a very high GPU demand. <comment374097> @DenisRasulev Why Java - web sites are usually Javascript <comment374098> @Bento - What are the websites like in Safari? What does Activity Monitor show for CPU and memory <comment374226> Activity monitor doesnt show anything weird, 10% CPU, Chrome does eat a lot of RAM though. Sometimes 800MB+ per tab.  15" MBP with Radeon R9 M370X, it's not disabled.  Safari does do it better though. Not as good as in Windows but better than Chrome on MacOS. Just cannot get used to Safari.
