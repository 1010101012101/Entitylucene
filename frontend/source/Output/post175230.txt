Reinstall OS X (Yosemite) without Internet Connection <body> I have got very slow internet connection. Last time, it took me 8 hours to download the Yosemite installation files. Is there anyway to clone a clean copy of OS X to another drive?  I have tried rsync in the Terminal after Bootup + Option. The rsync command is not available  <answer175232> You can use a third-party utility like Carbon Copy Cloner or you can even use Disk Utility in OS X to create and restore OS X Images.  There is also stronghdiutil/strong and strongasr/strong if you want to work from the command line.  In a Terminal type codeman hdiutil/code and codeman asr/code to bring up their man pages.  <comment206538> Next time, remember to copy the installer over to another drive, so the install doesn't delete it. <comment206540> I have seen "How to Make a Bootable Mac OS X Yosemite 10.10 USB Thumb Drive" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQurLY61EtA). What's the point creating a Bootable USB thumb drive? This drive takes 5.6GB. Booting from such a drive, you still need to download the installation file from the internet. No point in preparing that at all <comment206542> You can't install without an installer - you have to download it onceâ€¦ the trick is not to lose it. <comment206544> Nope. You have to use the internet by all means <comment206545> btw, did you try Recovery? Cmd/R at boot. <comment206546> @Hoy Cheung, you are wrong!  If you've created the USB installer properly you do not need to re-download to install! <comment206547> @user3439894, thanks for the suggestion. Can you provide the command for hdiutil? I am not very interested in any third-party utilities, since I need to create a clean copy. <comment206548> Don't shout. Rolled back edit. <comment206551> OK. I have found this page: https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT201372. I will try this first. <comment206554> @Tetsujin - I totally agree the trick is definitely not to lose the installer, given the way Apple pulled the Mavericks installer from the App Store. I also think it's equally important to make a USB installer and put it somewhere safe, so you'll always have the ability to reinstall whether you have network access or not... <comment206558> Thank you guys. I was misled by a staff in the genius bar. He said I couldn't create an installer and refused to help me to make one. But now I have succeeded to create one by following this page - support.apple.com/en-au/HT201372 <comment206565> @Hoy Cheung, Since Apple has a "Create a bootable installer for OS X Mavericks or Yosemite" document at their website I find it utterly ridiculous that the person helping you at the Apple store would refuse to help.  I would complain to the management of that store as there is no good excuse that you were not properly helped! <comment206796> I just wonder how Time Machine works? Is it an application that can recover the OS image before the computer boots into OS X? Should I still work with hdiutil?
