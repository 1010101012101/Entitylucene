2017 MacBook Pro 13" with Touchbar (USB-C) can't connect to LED Cinema Display 27" (Mini DisplayPort) <body> I purchased a new 2017 MacBook Pro 13" w/ Touchbar (updated in June) from my local Apple Store. I want to connect my 2010 LED Cinema Display 27" which uses a Mini DisplayPort connection. The clerk at the Apple Store wrongfully sold me the Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 adapter, which did not work. I later confirmed on Apple's support site that it does not work for this use.  I then purchased an AllSmartLife "USB C Type to Mini DisplayPort Adapter" from Amazon, which had many reviews from people having successfully made the connection I am trying to make. I received the adapter, plugged it in and... nothing. I looked back realized none of the reviews specified they had a 2017 MBP.  Does anyone have this exact setup with a successful connection? If so, which adapters did you use?
