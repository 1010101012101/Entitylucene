Can I add a couple of text files in Xcode for write and read <body> I'm using Xcode for developing in C++ language. Is it possible to add a couple of txt files to write and read from them? It is a very cool feature to test a project in a lot of tests.  <answer158366> Go to File → New File or type kbd⌘/kbd+kbdn/kbd. Under iOS or OS X select Other and click Next. You will be asked to give a name to that file. Call it codewhatever.txt/code and you are done.
