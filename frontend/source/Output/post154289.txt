Installing gprof on Mac <body> I would like to install GNU Profiler (gprof) on Mac. I tried to install codebinutils/code using Homebrew; however, the package that Homebrew installs from the following address does not have codegprof/code.   precodehttp://ftpmirror.gnu.org/binutils/binutils-2.24.tar.gz /code/pre  According to codebinutils/code website, it should have codegprof/code in it.  precodehttp://www.gnu.org/software/binutils/ /code/pre  Any suggestion for installing codegprof/code is welcome.  <answer154324> If you run codebrew install -v binutils/code, you will see this output flying by:  precode*** This configuration is not supported in the following subdirectories:      ld gas gprof      (Any other directories should still work fine.) /code/pre  In codeconfigure.ac/code there is  precode*-*-darwin*)   noconfigdirs="$noconfigdirs ld gas gdb gprof"   noconfigdirs="$noconfigdirs sim target-rda"   ;; /code/pre  So, codegprof/code is not supported on OS X.  I think the preferred profiling tool is DTrace.  <comment181597> Thanks. Any other solution to get `gprof` to work? <comment285173> @Javad do have any solution to gprof to work on OS X? <comment285424> @Mohan Not really, I gave up on this.
