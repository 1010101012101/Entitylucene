Broken iPhone and unable to back up Apple Watch <body> I broke my iPhone and lost all the data. I got my old iPhone which I managed to restart.  How do I backup my Apple Watch without a phone? I can't even pair it with the old iPhone.  <comment350134> If you have an iCloud backup of your old iPhone, that iCloud backup should also contain a backup of your Apple Watch.
