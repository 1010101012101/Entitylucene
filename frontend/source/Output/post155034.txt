Create custom text transformation <body> In a text box, I can right click and select Transformations  Make Uppercase.  Is it possible to create my own text transformations? a super simplified example would be to wrap the selected text in parenthesis.  <answer155071> Make an Automator service which accepts text and use the following AppleScript action:        img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GY1oY.png" width="588"  precodeon run {input}     return "(" &amp; (input as string) &amp; ")" end run /code/pre  <answer155226> You can also create code~/Library/Keybindings//code and save a property list like this as code~/Library/Keybindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict/code:  precode{   // option-9 to wrap with parentheses   "~9" = (setMark:, moveBackward:, insertText:, "(", swapWithMark:, moveForward:, moveForward:, insertText:, ")", moveBackward:); } /code/pre  Quit and reopen applications to apply the changes.  See http://osxnotes.net/keybindings.html or https://github.com/ttscoff/KeyBindings/blob/master/DefaultKeyBinding.dict for more examples.  <comment182372> did you try anything like Automator service, a Apple Script ?
