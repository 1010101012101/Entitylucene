Completely recover space from sparse bundle when "hdiutil compact" is not enough <body> emCurrent situation/em: I have a large sparse bundle image whose size is reported as 91GB (cmd+I from Finder). Its contents, instead, are only 80GB. codehdiutil compact/code does not shrink the image:  precodeStarting to compact… Reclaiming free space… .............................................................................. Finishing compaction… Reclaimed 0 bytes out of 25.6 GB possible. /code/pre  So there are 11GB of space that I cannot recover.  emHow I got there/em: Before getting into this situation, I had ~27GB of smallish files (MP3s, from 2-8MB) that I deleted from the image. I then ran codehdiutil compact/code, but it only recovered 16GB of those 27GB, leaving 11GB of wasted space.  Any idea? Google is failing me.  <answer62991> Either recreate the image, or defragment and repeat codehdiutil compact/code. For defragmentation, I use iDefrag.  <comment62537> From the manpage for `hdiutil`: "Depending on the location of files in the hosted filesystem", compact may or may not shrink the image. 11GB may just be worth recreating the image.
