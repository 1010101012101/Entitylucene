Sandbox browser for safely viewing malicious websites <body> I'm looking for a quick and safe way to browse potentially malicious / infected websites. So far all of the products I've found are PC only. I can run a Virtual PC environment but it's a pain and I'm looking for something simpler.  I'm on Yosemite.  <answer175204> I recommend a VM with the OS and the browsers of your choice. Using the snapshot/clone features you may always revert to the original vanilla state.  Three of the advantages:  ul liUse an arbitrary OS/browser combination (a lot of malicious websites often attack special combinations e.g. Windows XP/7/IE or OS/Flash) /li liYou may detect any impact on the file system safely by comparing the mounted vanilla and infected volume (in read only mode)./li liYou may run fseventer or dtrace (Mac OS X) or other tools (Win/Linux) without interference of your real OS./li /ul  Another possibility is outlined here in an article from 2010. Don't know if it still works:  OS X has a built-in sandbox feature for applications, which can restrict their access to certain parts of the system. There isn't a lot of documentation available on the sandboxing system, but I've successfully been able to sandbox Firefox. It has some limitations, but my plug-ins and add-ons work though yours may not.   If you have issues, you'll have to search for the directories where your plug-ins are housed, and give read or read/write access permissions in the firefox-sandbox file. There is only write permission to the ~/Downloads directory, so if you want to save files in a different location, you will have to change the firefox-sandbox file or move them after the download has finished. First, create the following file and save it somewhere as firefox-sandbox:  precode;; http://codereview.chromium.org/379019/diff/1/2 (version 1)  (deny default)  (allow file-write* file-read-data file-read-metadata   (regex "^/Users/user_name/Downloads")   (regex "^/Users/user_name/Library/Application Support/Mozilla")   (regex "^/Users/user_name/Library/Application Support/Firefox")   (regex "^/Users/user_name/Library/Preferences")   (regex "^/Users/user_name/Library/PreferencePanes")   (regex "^/Users/user_name/Library/Caches/Firefox")   (regex "^/Users/user_name/Library/Caches/TemporaryItems")   (regex "^/Applications/Firefox.app")   (regex "^(/private)?/tmp/"))  (allow file-read-data file-read-metadata   (regex "^/dev/autofs.*")   (regex "^/Library/Preferences")   (regex "^/Library/Internet Plug-Ins")   (regex "^/Library/PreferencePanes")   (regex "^/usr/share/icu")   (regex "^/usr/share/locale")   (regex "^/System/Library")   (regex "^/Applications/Firefox.app")   (regex "^/usr/lib")   (regex "^/var")   (regex #"Frameworks/SDL.framework") ; Our Module Directory Services cache   (regex "^/private/var/tmp/mds/")   (regex "^/private/var/tmp/mds/[0-9]+(/|$)")   (regex "^/Users/user_name"))  (allow mach* sysctl-read)  (import "/usr/share/sandbox/bsd.sb") (deny file-write-data    (regex #"^(/private)?/etc/localtime$"      #"^/usr/share/nls/"      #"^/usr/share/zoneinfo/"))  (allow process-exec    (regex "^/Applications/Firefox.app"))  (allow network*) /code/pre  Replace the /Applications/Firefox.app.... parts with the path to Firefox on your system. Also replace user_name with your username. Next, open up a Terminal and execute this command:  precodesandbox-exec -f firefox-sandbox /Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox-bin /code/pre  Make sure the firefox-sandbox file is in the directory where you run the above command, and Firefox should launch in a protected sandbox.    <comment206483> @Asmus It is not at all relevant to this question (or any of your business) but I'm a web developer and I often work with clients who call me to work on their infected websites. In other words, it's my job. Thanks for your concern. <comment206487> Yeah this is my fallback but it's cumbersome to fire up a VM just to quickly check a site. I was hoping for a quicker option <comment206494> Of course this bit of information is not *needed* to answer your question, but I have the tendency to ask "why?" before helping others do achieve something potentially dangerous/stupid (here: possibly trying to reach "shady" parts of the internet, which may do more harm than good in the end). <comment216030> Have you found any better solution to this problem besides using a virtual machine? <comment338585> What about just viewing the infected website on Safari or Chrome for iPhone? That's what I do sometimes :D
