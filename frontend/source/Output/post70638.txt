How can I find and edit my external hard-drive's .fseventsd folder? <body> While changing my 'file directory' preferences on Vuze, I accidentally created a folder in the .fseventsd-folder on my Seagate external hard-drive.  I can't even find the .fseventsd-folder using search Spotlight, in fact the only way I can see this folder is when I go back to the file directory preferences from Vuze and I can't edit anything from there.  ol liIs this going to damage anything, delete my data or anything weird like that?/li liIs there any way of deleting this folder (the accidentally created folder not the .fseventsd-folder)?  /li /ol  <answer70640> Files and folders starting with a '.' are invisible in Finder by default. You have to activate this option in order to view/delete them.    Open Terminal and typ codedefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool true/code, after that, restart your Finder.br To hide those files again, open Terminal and type codedefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool false/code and restart Finder again.   But remember, they are hidden for a reason, so don't mess around with this kind of folders unless you are absolutely certain of your actions...  <answer70643> If you're comfortable with a terminal then navigate to your external disk (usually lives in the code/Volumes//code directory:  precodecd /Volumes/&lt;Name-of-disk&gt;/path/to/.fseventsd-folder /code/pre  If you're not sure where this is you can find it by navigating to code/Volumes/&lt;Name-of-disk&gt;/code and executing:  precodefind . -name .fseventsd-folder /code/pre  hr  Once you are inside the directory, list the files in that directory (the code-a/code lists hidden filesâ€”the ones that start with a code./code):  precodels -a /code/pre  Locate the name of the folder you accidentally created from the output of the above command and then use the following command:  precoderm -r -i &lt;name-of-folder&gt; /code/pre  (The code-i/code is optional but it will ask you to confirm the action if you're a little nervous.  hr  Then exit the terminal using:  precodeexit /code/pre  <answer84271> If you don't want to show hidden files in Finder (files/folders starting with a "."), then another way how to gain access to a hidden folder is this:  ul liOpen a Finder window/li liPress kbdCmd/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbdG/kbd/li liIn the input dialog, type out the folder you want to get to.br E.g. code/Volumes/250GB HDD/.fseventsd/code.../li /ul  emNote: You can use the kbdTab/kbd key to strongauto-complete/strong.
