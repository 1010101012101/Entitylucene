Installing OpenMP-enabled XGBoost <body> I have scoured the web trying to figure out how to install XGboost. A simple pip or conda install does not work, even though it worked for many of my colleagues. I went to the installation guide which directed me to run the following to install gcc:  precodebrew install gcc --without-multilib /code/pre  To confirm I already have it installed I tried again and received the following message:  precodeWarning: gcc-7.1.0 already installed /code/pre  So I should be good there. Then I clone the repository with:  precodegit clone --recursive https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost /code/pre  and then run the following:  precodecd xgboost; cp make/config.mk ./config.mk; make -j4 /code/pre  and run in to the following errors:      c++ -std=c++11 -Wall -Wno-unknown-pragmas -Iinclude   -Idmlc-core/include -Irabit/include -O3 -funroll-loops -msse2 -fPIC -fopenmp -MM -MT build/learner.o src/learner.cc build/learner.d   c++ -std=c++11 -Wall -Wno-unknown-pragmas -Iinclude   -Idmlc-core/include -Irabit/include -O3 -funroll-loops -msse2 -fPIC -fopenmp -MM -MT build/logging.o src/logging.cc build/logging.d   c++ -std=c++11 -Wall -Wno-unknown-pragmas -Iinclude   -Idmlc-core/include -Irabit/include -O3 -funroll-loops -msse2 -fPIC -fopenmp -MM -MT build/c_api/c_api.o src/c_api/c_api.cc build/c_api/c_api.d   c++ -std=c++11 -Wall -Wno-unknown-pragmas -Iinclude   -Idmlc-core/include -Irabit/include -O3 -funroll-loops -msse2 -fPIC -fopenmp -MM -MT build/c_api/c_api_error.o src/c_api/c_api_error.cc build/c_api/c_api_error.d   clangclang: : errorerror: : unsupported option '-fopenmp'unsupported option '-fopenmp'      clang: error: unsupported option '-fopenmp'   clang: error: unsupported option '-fopenmp'   make: strong* [build/c_api/c_api_error.o] Error 1   make: em/strong Waiting for unfinished jobs....   make: strong/em [build/logging.o] Error 1   make: */strong [build/learner.o] Error 1   make: *** [build/c_api/c_api.o] Error 1   I can't make sense of what the issue is, but really need XGboost to run through Python on my computer!  installation guide: http://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build.html  system version: macOS Sierra Version 10.12.4  <answer291263> I know this is old, but I had the exact same error as you and here is what I did to solve it.  I edited the first few lines of the config.mk file yopu are copying to be  precodeexport CC = gcc-7 export CXX = g++-7 /code/pre  because you are using gcc 7.1  Then you can finish making and building as you can find in many tutorials (e.g. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39315156/how-to-install-xgboost-in-python-on-macos)  <comment357500> Please add your system version and a link to the installation guide you followed, by editing your question. Don't post the details as a comment!
