When I unplug my headphones, my speakers (and headphones) stop working <body> Happens intermittently: When I unplug my Sony headphones, I am unable to get my 17" MBP (2.8ghz intel core 2 duo, running Lion), to make any sound. I've tried a handful of different hardware, and nothing will make a peep.   Restarting "fixes" it.   <answer25451> Its a bug Lion has.  This thread should provide you with more info of users suffering the same bug.  This app claims to fix it (I found it on that same thread).  I haven't had the bug for a while, but I did have it quite a bit before. I really hope Apple fixes it, by 10.7.2 perhaps.  Hope it helps!  strongEdit/strong: Probably the most relevant information in the thread is that it seems to be a bug on Core Audio. code$ sudo killall coreaudiod/code quits the process and the system automatically restarts it, effectively providing a quick fix to the bug. The rest are people posting about their personal experiences and thanking the developer of the app that automatically applies this fix.  <comment28792> Have you tried simply reinserting the headphones and pulling them back out again? Sometimes pulling headphones out too quickly can leave the OS confused. <comment181050> Please add the relevant content to your answer; if those links die, your answer becomes useless.  It's also worth noting it happens to me on 10.10 with a Late 2013 MBPr 15-inch.
