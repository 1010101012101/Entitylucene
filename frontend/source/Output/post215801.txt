Execute arbitrary script when iTunes plays new song? <body> I want to execute a script when iTunes plays a new song.  I have looked at Automator as well as the iTunes Library in Script Editor, but don't see anything that will allow me to do this.  Any ideas?  <answer215810> You could use an AppleScript to watch for song changes. The script below will get you started:  precodetell application "System Events"      set previousSong to ""      repeat         if exists process "iTunes" then             tell application "iTunes"                 if player state is playing then                     set currentSong to name of current track                     if currentSong is not previousSong then                         set previousSong to currentSong                          -- Execute your script, command, or application here                                                 say "Song changed"                      end if                  end if             end tell              -- Wait some seconds             delay 10         else             exit repeat         end if     end repeat  end tell /code/pre  This AppleScript checks every 10 seconds for the name of the currently playing song. If the song name differs from 10 seconds ago, the phrase "Song changed" is spoken.  <comment260728> This is would probably the best way, however if you do not intend to skip songs, may I suggest, that you wait for the length of some, so it doesn't run so often. Just drag iTunes to Script Editor to see how to get that.
