How to avoid iTunes' "Do you want the application iTunes.app to accept incoming network connections?"? <body> The last few releases of iTunes 12.5.x.y ask, every time iTunes is launched:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/w04ek.png" alt="Do you want the application &quot;iTunes.app&quot; to accept incoming network connections?"  precodeDo you want the application "iTunes.app" to accept incoming network connections? /code/pre  Is there a way to select either answer as a default and avoid getting constantly asked that question?  <answer271531> strongEl Capitan/strong  Uninstalling and reinstalling iTunes is the only way I could solve this issue.  As this (battery-draining, maldesigned) page warns you, you can't just drag iTunes to the Trash. El Capitan will warn you that it's part of the OS. codeGet Info/code, clicking on the padlock, and giving everyone read+write permission will get over that.  The next step is to download it. Surprise: iTunes is not available on the App Store. But you can download a dmg just fine here.  After 5 minutes of use I can confirm the message no longer appears.  I can also confirm that the music collection appears unharmed.  strongPre El Capitan/strong  Thanks to owlswipe's hint, the solution follows.  In System Preferences, under Security &amp; Privacy  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LSojM.png" alt="system preferences"  Click "Firewall Options"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WA1V5.png" alt="incoming connections"  and allow incoming connections for iTunes.  It's not clear why "incoming connections" is an option for iTunes.  <answer294347> Deleting then installing iTunes seems like a bizarre way to resolve this issue, but it's also the only solution I've found that actually works.  <comment341249> You can probably set a default in System Preferences - Security and Privacy - Firewall and stop that from popping up? <comment341252> @owlswipe   You're right. Exiting iTunes, turning the firewall off, and relaunching iTunes avoids triggering the dialog. The dialog comes back up when I turn the firewall back on while iTunes is running. In any case, turning the firewall off is a rather drastic solution! <comment341296> There are no other settings in Firewall Preferences that could have an effect (without turning off firewall)? <comment341309> @owlswipe thanks, that was it. I don't recall changing this setting. In any case, I wrote an answer. <comment341311> @stuffe It's actually a 3-question questionnaire ;-). The other two questions are: http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/271532/7985 and http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/222955/7985 <comment341351> Happy to help! Glad you found it. <comment371539> This page https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5262268?start=0&tstart=0   suggests that "some kind of permission or application signature" is the culprit. We're still waiting for someone to identify which file permission gets messed up. That would be a much lighter solution. (Not sure what an "application signature" might be.)
