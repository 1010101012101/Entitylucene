macOS Sierra on external drive – Mac do not go to sleep anymore <body> Since two days I am using an external SSD as system disk (to work with my system on my iMac or on my new arriving MacBook Pro – on demand – without any synchronization process). Just attach the disk and boot my system.  On my iMac this work pretty good. I have tested my Thunderbold 2 case – wich was faster on boot as the USB 3.0 case. But the Thunderbold case need external power – so thats not perfect.  Now I am using the USB 3.0 case just connected via USB. And this morning I noticed, that my iMac didn't went to sleep – just the dispay turned off. So the system will not go to sleep automatically. After 5 minutes with turned off display I can still see some flashing LED on the SSD case – once a minute or something.  What can I do to get my system automatically to sleep again?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/09vZw.png" alt="enter image description here"  Update:    Running codepmset -g/code in Terminal, I get the following  precodeCurrently in use:  standby               1  Sleep On Power Button 1  womp                  0  halfdim               1  hibernatefile         /var/vm/sleepimage  powernap              0  autorestart           0  networkoversleep      0  disksleep             0  sleep                 1 (sleep prevented by backupd, backupd, UserEventAgent)  autopoweroffdelay     28800  hibernatemode         0  autopoweroff          1  ttyskeepawake         1  displaysleep          1  standbydelay          10800 /code/pre  <answer287389> Maybe you have "Prevent computer from sleeping..." activated in Energy Saver preferences. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dA1gi.png" alt=""  <answer287394> There are dozens of reasons a Mac won’t sleep on the Sierra versions of the os. Have a look at the details and diagnostics that codepmset/code command provides:  ul liMacBook Pro won’t sleep automatically — no process preventing sleep according to pmset. What’s going on?/li /ul  In many cases it’s software like google notifier that prevent sleep by design or software like google software update that run a process that often will then block sleep since it’s regularly downloading and updating in the background and hanging around until chrome relaunches.   <answer287397> strongIt won't go to sleep because it can't./strong  There's a process (or processes) preventing your system from going to sleep.  codepmset -g/code tells us:     code(sleep prevented by backupd, backupd, UserEventAgent)/code   ul licodebackupd/code is the Time Machine backup daemon which more than likely is backing up to a USB drive./li liUserEventAgent is a processes that manages high level events that codelaunchd/code doesn't manage - this could be any number of things./li /ul  To put the machine to sleep you will need to disable Time Machine and resolve whatever process codeUserEventAgent/code is attached to (it may be Time Machine itself).  <comment362836> No. I have unchecked all four checkboxes. And checking "put harddisk to sleep when possible" also do not change anything. <comment362838> Do you have a blanck screensaver activated? <comment362839> I have the default screensaver activated. It appears, then after a few minutes the display turns off but the iMac do not go really to sleep. <comment362843> Could you include in your question a screen capture of `System preferences  Energy Saver  Power Adapter` so as to get better answers? <comment362844> Edited. But german. Sorry for that. <comment362852> And why is it possible to get the iMac sleeping when manually activating the sleep mode (via the Apple logo top left). Is it possible to create a small script that detects "no mouse movement" or "copy actions" for X seconds (like the system itself) and put the iMac via Shell script or something into sleep mode. <comment362855> Is it actually being put to sleep or is the display just being put into low power mode? <comment362856> It is in sleep. The LED on mouse and SSD goes off after a few seconds. My server (which is checking for network availablility via bash script) turns off after 5 minutes if iMac not reachable. So yes, it seems to be in sleep mode. <comment362858> `Currently in use:  standby              1  Sleep On Power Button 1  womp                 0  halfdim              1  hibernatefile        /var/vm/sleepimage  powernap             0  autorestart          0  networkoversleep     0  disksleep            0  sleep                1 (sleep prevented by backupd, backupd, UserEventAgent)  autopoweroffdelay    28800  hibernatemode        0  autopoweroff         1  ttyskeepawake        1  displaysleep         1  standbydelay         10800`  actually is TM backup running. <comment362860> Now I disabled automatic TM backup and aborted the acutal backup and everything got to sleep. Hmm. :-) Doing the backup now and will test it again after that. <comment362946> TM was the "problem". After starting a completely new TM backup and finishing it the iMac went to sleep as well :-) Thanks for your support!
