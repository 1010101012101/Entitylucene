Browser Ghost Image Briefly Appears <body> I am regularly seeing the top edge of another Chrome browser window in the bottom right of my Macbook Air screen (OS 10.11.6). I can't see enough of the window to view the contents, but it only last about 2 seconds, and then whooshes off the screen. It often happens when I open a new tab or window while using Chrome.  Has anyone else experienced this? I don't have a screen shot because it happens so quickly.  <comment339948> Have you ever connected an external monitor to your MBA at any time? <comment340155> Never, only a portable CD player, a Kindle (does that count as a monitor?)... <comment340230> My idea was that you'd set some Chrome window to open on another monitor that is now disconnected. • What happens if you run Chrome when the MBA is disconnected from a network (either wired or wireless)? • Do you have a default page that opens when you run Chrome? (Preferences  On startup  Open a specific page or set of pages) Perhaps there is odd page stuck in there from the past.
