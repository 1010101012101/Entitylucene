Disable Shift Cmd Q for logout <body> I would like to disable  kbdShift/kbd+kbdCommand/kbd+kbdQ/kbd keyboard shortcut for Log Out.   I am using strongKarabiner/strong at the moment, but I only managed to disable it completely using the following xml:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;     &lt;item&gt;         &lt;name&gt;Disable COMMAND SHIFT Q for Logout&lt;/name&gt;         &lt;identifier&gt;disable_CMD_SHIFT_Q_private&lt;/identifier&gt;         &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::Q, VK_SHIFT | VK_COMMAND | ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::VK_NONE&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  but I would like to have the keyboard combination available in strongemacs/strong (in ESS for debugging).  Is there some way that I can effectively unmap the keyboard combination?  <answer210567> The following works for me on 10.9.5:  ol liSystem Preferences  Keyboard  Shortcuts  App Shortcuts./li li'+' to add a shortcut/li liApplication: codeAll Applications/code/li liMenu Title: codeLog Out [Your Name]…/code  Here, copy the exact text shown in the Apple menu, replacing code[Your Name]/code, and note that the ellipsis code…/code must be typed with kbdalt/kbd-kbd;/kbd/li liKeyboard Shortcut: kbdctrl/kbd-kbdshift/kbd-kbdcmd/kbd-kbdQ/kbd (or whatever you prefer: something different to kbdshift/kbd-kbdcmd/kbd-kbdQ/kbd)/li liLog out and in again./li liNote that the keyboard shortcut has changed in the Apple menu, and kbdshift/kbd-kbdcmd/kbd-kbdQ/kbd no longer triggers the menu./li /ol  <comment254243> Works perfectly. Very good to remember that the system shortcuts can be modified even if they are not visible in Preferences  Keyboard  Shortcuts. <comment286212> Works for me as well on Yosemite (10.10.5)
