Use move to next space shortcut on multiple monitors <body> kbdcontrol/kbdkbd/kbd is used to switch to space right. I use two monitors. The above shortcut works on one monitor. To make this shortcut to work on the second monitor, I need to click on the second monitor and then use this shortcut. Even focusing on some application using kbdcmd/kbdkbdtab/kbd opened on second monitor doesn't work. How to make this work on the second monitor using keyboard only?
