Change the font size of Safari's Web Inspector <body> Does anyone know how to change the font size in Safari's Web Inspector? It's too small for me and my eyes can't stand staring at it during long periods of time.   I've found some links on the web concerning my question but they don't seem to work either:  ol lihttps://gist.github.com/vlazar/1549785/li lihttp://miekd.com/articles/adding-some-monospace-to-the-safari-web-inspector//li /ol  I'll switch back to Chrome and use its own Web Inspector if there aren't any solutions available.  <answer88580> At the end of inspector.css add the font size and style.  The file is located in code/System/Library/Frameworks/WebKit.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/WebCore.framework/Versions/A/Resources/inspector/code  (for Safari on Windows the file located at:  codeC:\Program Files (x86)\Safari\Apple Application Support\WebKit.resources\inspector\inspector.css/code )  An example:  precodebody, #console-messages{ font-size:18px; } /code/pre  <answer102514> For Mountain Lion (10.8.x), I found the file name is actually strongMain.css/strong and on my system it is located in:  /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/WebInspector.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/  Add the following text to the end of this file and save it. Essentially, this is the same text as in the other answer in this thread, but without the line breaks.  codebody, #console-messages{font-size:18px;}/code  You will need to strongrestart your Safari/strong after you make this change, before it will take effect.  h3Tip: To quickly open the folder where Main.css is located.../h3  ol liSelect the path/li liRight-click on the selected path and then from the popup menu choose: emServices/em - emOpen/em./li liThis will open the folder for you./li /ol  <answer111632> Thanks for the answers above. As an update, in Mavericks 10.9, the file is still Main.css and can now be found at the following path: /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/WebInspectorUI.framework/Versions/A/Resources  <comment131267> Rather than thanking for other answers in your answer you may comment or preferably, use your votes and upvote the answer you like. <comment134335> There is no file inspector.css in that directory :( <comment134336> Didn't work for me. Is there possibly less hacky way? <comment134849> Not that I know of. Actually, I have switched to Chrome for my web development. In Chrome you can just press Cmd+/- to adjust the console and development environment font size and I no longer have out-of-memory problems, which I did with Safari.
