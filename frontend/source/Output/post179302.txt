Fan speed increased after upgrading to SSD <body> I just replaced my Macbook Pro's Mid 2012 HDD with a Samsung 850 EVO SSD. The performance is great and I am very happy, but I noticed that the fan seems to run faster. It is not a drastic change, but it is noticeable. I have downloaded iStat Menus, the Exhaust of the fan is 2000 rpm and the Temperature is a bit over 50°. Is that normal and is there any chance I did something wrong while replacing the HDD?  I am running Yosemite and I did a SMC reset.   <answer179305> Have a look at Controlling the fan speed in Mac models after an SSD upgrade.

After some extended research I found out statements that 2000 rpm is actually normal for MBP 2012 <comment212541> @Georgi if you found references solving your question feel free to use full answer with link to references to help others with similar question. <comment329400> Can someone confirm if this is true? if so the answer above should be removed or modified. <comment329401> What URL did you find the problem? It's common that some side sites get messed up / malicious downloads. Good information if we can narrow down what source to avoid. I edited the answer above since MacUpdate might not be the best place to get smcFanControl.
