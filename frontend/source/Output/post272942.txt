In Excel 2016, is there a way to pull data labels from another range of cells? <body> I believe the question is pretty straightforward. The way it's done on Windows in any of the latest version is on the format pane, usually there is an option to select data from a range of cell. But it seems to be missing here. Is there a way? If possible without resorting to VBA.  Thanks :)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kBYsp.png" alt="Label options"
