Scaled resolution on a 12-inch MacBook <body> If you use a scaled resolution (not right-2X) on a MacBook Pro w/ retina display, it will tell "using a scaled resolution may affect performance". img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qqF2a.png" alt="13&quot; MacBook Pro"  However, on a 12" MacBook, the scaled resolution is used by default (the default is "looks like 1280x800" and the non-scaled resolution should be "looks like 1152x720"), and there is no prompt about performance. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PZpFD.png" alt="12&quot; MacBook"  What is under the hood? Is Apple simply hiding the fact that 12" MacBook is using a performance-hurting scale by default, or the 12" one is special in hardware?  <comment325490> The new Mac Book Pro (at least the 13" one) also seems to use the scaled resolution as default. So the same question can be asked there.
