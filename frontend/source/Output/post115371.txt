The point is that the argument (i.e. the POSIX folder path) is provided to `$@`. You'll need to have your Python script understand the argument itself. For /usr/bin/python, see my answer to your last question: the arguments are passed to `sys.argv[1:]`. <comment135054> yes i am doing that already :/ <comment135055> Finally Got it working!!!, but still the menu is in Services located here would have been nice it menu could be at second number in the list of right click items
