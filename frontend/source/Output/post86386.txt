Can not preview message in Mail.app <body> Using last OS X Lion, I was using Mail.app, classic view, so there was always a preview for each message. This has now dissapeared, how can I solve this?  <answer86398> Classic view is the view set in PreferencesViewingUse classic layout:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Mhdos.png" alt="enter image description here"  In this view, the message preview area is located below the message list.   The view may be minimized:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Bx3nb.png" alt="enter image description here"  Just drag the separator at the bottom of the window to show the message area.   <comment99769> With classic view, you mean you use PreferencesViewingUse classic layout? The preview view may be minimized, is there a separator at the bottom of the window which you could drag? Could you add a screenshot of Mail.app? <comment99782> yes!!! the separator was somehow hidden, thanks a lot! <comment99789> Great it worked, I added an answer, take a look at it and accept it if you think it correctly describes how to solve your issue. Thanks! <comment99797> of course, don now!
