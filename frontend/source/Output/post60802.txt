Why do httpd and mysqld processes not show up in Activity Monitor? <body> I'm running Mountain Lions built in Apache2 server. I have started the server and I can see the web pages but I can't see any httpd process in the Activity Monitor. Same goes for MySQL. I can't see mysqld process in it either.  I used MAMP before and those processes where shown in the Activity Monitor.  I can run the following command in terminal to list all processes in a text file. httpd and mysqld processes are showing up there.  codeps -A &gt; process.txt/code  Why the Activity Monitor is not showing these processes?  <answer60901> In Activity Monitor there is a dropdown menu in the top of the window. emMy Processes/em was selected. Changing it to emAll Processes/em solved the issue.  <comment70055> Choose _All Processes_ form the dropdown in Activity Monitor.
