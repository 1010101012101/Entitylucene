List all devices connected, lsblk for Mac OS X <body> In Linux if I want to see all the devices currently connected to my computer in the command-line, I run:   precodelsblk/code/pre  or    precodeblkid/code/pre  What's the equivalent command under Mac OS X?    strongNOTE/strong    The goal here is to be able to option information about a device based on its label or other uniquely identifying attributes, emeven if it hasn't been mounted/em, thus codedf/code is not a viable option.    hr /  Examples of the kind of info I'm looking for are:    ul licode/dev/&lt;dev-name&gt;/code/li licodeuuid/code/li licodelabel (if any)/code/li licodemount point/code br //li /ul  strongNOTE/strong  I strongneed/strong to be able to see network-attached drives as well!  <answer107956> strongcodediskutil list/code/strong will list all disks with their identifiers, even if unmounted.  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"code/dev/disk0    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *251.0 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:                  Apple_HFS Mac SSD                 150.0 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3    4:       Microsoft Basic Data Windows 8               100.1 GB   disk0s4 /dev/disk1    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *500.1 GB   disk1    1:                  Apple_HFS George Garside          300.2 GB   disk1s1    2:               Windows_NTFS GRGARSIDE               199.9 GB   disk1s2 /code/pre  hr  emFor mounted disks onlyâ€¦/em  To find the raw device name (i.e. code/dev/disk0s1/code) you can run strongcodedf/code/strong.  You can limit the results to locally-mounted filesystems, use codedf -Hl/code.br This results in a list of partitions and their raw device names, as shown below:  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codeFilesystem     Size   Used  Avail Capacity  iused    ifree %iused  Mounted on /dev/disk0s2   150G   130G    20G    87% 31761475  4859615   87%   / /dev/disk0s4   100G    83G    17G    83%   184667 17015601    1%   /Volumes/Windows 8 /dev/disk1s1   300G   282G    19G    94% 68771109  4529660   94%   /Volumes/George Garside /dev/disk1s2   200G   172G    27G    87%   144125 26731127    1%   /Volumes/GRGARSIDE /code/pre  <answer107964> Mac OS X offers the codesystem_profiler/code utility that can be run from Terminal. You can pipe it through grep to find specific strings that you want.  <comment126625> This only works on mounted drives, I want to be able to see ***all*** devices, regardless of whether they are mounted or not. <comment126630> @AlexejMagura See edit :) <comment130943> does that work with network volumes?  I can't seem to get it to do that. <comment130945> For drives that aren't mounted yet, I mean, sorry. <comment130946> @AlexejMagura No, since when network volumes are unmounted, they are not available to be remounted in the same way that physical disks are. <comment131618> so it's not possible to see network attached drives that are unmounted?  (I unaccepted so that I'd get your attention, sorry about that.)  I've been trying to figure out a way to say `if network drive is present mount it on /Volumes/DRIVE-LABEL` in a backup script I've been writing. <comment131621> @AlexejMagura That's not really possible, although an AppleScript `try` should work: just try to connect to the drive as usual between `try` and `end try`. <comment244561> Where is the UUID? <comment248884> Toward helping some users: this command won't do the job if one do the disks has certain corruptions, like btree errors. Then the `diskutil` will error out before showing the USB device. An impediment when you need to backup to said USB drive before reformatting the corrupt disk
