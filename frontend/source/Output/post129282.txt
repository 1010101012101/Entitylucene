How can I use Torify for an App on OS X <body> I want one of my applications to use Tor; however the app itself does not have proxy setting and it uses the System proxy. The problem is that I don't want to set my system proxy and I just want this one application to use tor.  I searched a bit for a solution, I came up with codetorify/code. I have installed codetor/code and codetorify/code using codebrew/code and everything works fine and for example I can force codecurl/code to use codetor/code like this: codetorify curl ifconfig.me 2/code  To use codetorify/code, I need to start my app from Terminal. For this, I use codeopen -a myapp/code. However, this does not make codemyapp/code to go behind the tor proxy.I think it's because of the codeopen/code command and I think I have to open codemyapp/code somehow directly. By the way, codemyapp/code does not work when I try to run it by opening the executable file inside the code/Contents/MacOS/code folder.  Do you guys have any suggestion?  Thanks in advance  <answer129284> h3Tell your command where your myapp.app resides/h3  You need to provide the open command an absolute or relative path to the application, unless the executable is already within your $PATH, or you change your working directory to the location in the filesystem where your myapp.app is (in my examples, myapp.app is the Applications folder, the home Applications folder, a folder called someotherplace, and the Shared folder, respectively).  precode open /Applications/myapp.app  open ~/Applications/myapp.app  open ../someotherplace/myapp.app  cd &amp;&amp; cd ../Shared/ &amp;&amp; open myapp.app /code/pre  You can also type your open command and hit spacebar, and drag your application from anywhere into the Terminal, and the path will be provided.  h3There is another way/h3  You can execute your executable using its full path  and adding the ampersand.  This will run it in the background so your terminal isn't tied up:  precode ./myapp.app/Contents/MacOS/myapp &amp;  /Applications/myapp.app/Contents/MacOS/myapp &amp;  cd /Volumes/externaldisk/projects/thisone/myapp.app/Contents/MacOS &amp;&amp; ./myapp &amp; /code/pre  And interestingly, using this method you can launch as many instances of your app as you have memory to do so.  h3To use torify with your myapp.app/h3  I'm reasonably sure you need to launch it like this to use torify (assuming your myapp.app is in the /Applications folder):  precode torify /Applications/myapp.app/Contents/MacOS/myapp &amp; /code/pre  or   precode cd /Applications/myapp.app/Contents/MacOS/  torify myapp &amp; /code/pre  <answer171834> You're right. codeopen/code launches the program in the background, so Torify doesn't work. The solution is to start the app by directly invoking its binary. Here's how:  precodetorify /Applications/MyApp.app/Contents/MacOS/MyApp /code/pre  <comment151630> I did not mean that `myapp` cannot run from terminal. The thing is that if I run `myapp` using the `open` command it won't run behind the Tor proxy. By the way, it does not run correctly when I open it using the binary file inside the `/Contents/MacOS/` folder. <comment151631> I edited my question to be more understandable.
