How to know the duration of battery usage in one session? <body> I would like to know how long was my battery running since it's last charge. There is a built-in time-remaining counter but I would like a time-used counter.  <answer111187> Starting with Mavericks (OS X 10.9), this is available in Activity Monitor. Open Activity Monitor from the /Applications/Utilities folder, and go to the Energy tab. The center pane of the statistics at the bottom of the window includes the amount of time since you last unplugged the charger, which appears shortly after you switch to battery power.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PdsPe.png" alt="Select the energy tab"br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SOH25.png" alt="Battery time at bottom of center pane"  <comment130893> That's great, but it shows the time since the macbook has been unplugged, whether it was used or in sleep mode. Is there a way to filter out sleep time ? <comment130948> Not that I know of. One way to think of it is that it *is* using battery power when asleep, just not as much. I suppose if you really want to ignore sleep time, you could calculate it manually from that counter and data from `pmset -g log` on the command line, but that seems like more effort than it's worth. <comment130956> Agreed. While it uses minimal battery power during sleep, the counter still adds up the time the laptop was set to sleep. For example, 5 hours of total sleep time counts as 5 hours since battery was discharged, even though it uses 1-2% power. <comment340030> Does this include the time that it was completely shut down
