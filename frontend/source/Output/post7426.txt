Bandwidth shaper or bandwidth controller application for Mac OS X <body> I'm looking for a bandwidth/packet throttle/shaper program with the following features:  ul liSimilar to Windows-based Netlimiter./li liGUI based and not terminal or command line./li liShows list of all applications communicating over network its connections, transfer rates and more./li liSet download or upload transfer rate limits for applications, connections or groups of them. /li /ul  <answer7439> There are multiple ways to do this.  For example, using ipfw, codepf/code, or trickle, or GUI front ends to these, such as:  ul liSpeed Limit (not maintained as of 2014)/li liThrottled (only 10.4.x - 10.8.x)/li liWaterroof (10.7): http://www.hanynet.com/waterroof//li liIceFloor (10.8): http://www.hanynet.com/icefloor//li /ul  <answer7601> h2Charles Proxy/h2  Limit the bandwidth and see requests, responses in real time. br  Charles Proxy has quite a nice GUI.   <answer54374> Waterroof or Noobproof, both free!!  <answer63349> For those on 10.7 or newersup1/sup, the easiest solution to the bandwidth limiting part of the question is Apple's Network Link Conditioner (NLC), a free utility that was originally included with Xcode. Then Apple got all sandbox-happy, so now it's a separate download from Apple's developer web site, called the Hardware IO Tools for Xcode.  The important points going for NLC are that it's from Apple, it's got a very straightforward UI, and it emworks/em. Some of the other suggestions given in other answers fail some or all of these criteria, particularly in failing to work on newer OSes.  As for monitoring per-application bandwidth usage, I recommend Rubbernet.sup2/sup  hr  strongFootnotes:/strong  ol liIf you're still on 10.6 or older, you can get the same effect from the command line by adding a limited-bandwidth pipe to the firewall./li liBeware that if you're using the App Store version of Rubbernet, you also need to install a daemon to do the monitoring. (Another end-around the sandbox mess, I'm afraid.)/li /ol  <answer102147> take a look at little snitch: http://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/index.html  Little Snitch features real-time network monitoring. It started as a nice GUI for adding per-application access rules and has grown into a bandwidth tool as well. I don't know how to use it to shape bandwidth. It's mostly an all-or-nothing, accept/reject network access monitor.  Still, it will certainly help you find out which processes are spiking your Mac's network activity.  img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/hcft6w1wnqa0myf/Screenshot%202014-03-11%2022.14.38.png" alt="menu snitch"  <comment7973> See SuperUser question http://superuser.com/questions/126642/throttle-network-bandwidth-per-application-in-mac-os-x <comment8053> +1 For those. Sadly none really does what the OP wants which is real time monitoring of network traffic by App. Been looking for this myself for some time to no avail :S <comment8081> `iftop` might be useful for you. Does realtime monitoring (not shaping), and by host (not app). <comment56952> Unfortunately http only <comment56967> No you can do HTTPS, it's in the proxy settings I think <comment63741> `ipfw` is deprecated according to `man` on Lion. can `pfctl` be used the same way? <comment63751> Yup. And IceFloor is a frontend: http://www.hanynet.com/icefloor/index.html <comment73237> The canonical question on this site appears to be here - http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/24066/how-to-simulate-slow-internet-connections-on-the-mac <comment80672> Thanks for your answer, geo! Can you please add more information? How do these applications help the OP? <comment82228> I read all the above answers, and still I agree that nobody found the solution. We are looking for an exact alternative of netlimiter for windows. So a GUI based software that easily allows to monitor and also limit the download/upload of each application, not ports, but applications. For example if I am using JAKSTA to download videos that will use all the available bandwidth leaving me stuck and unable to surf the web while I download the videos. So, Any valid alternative for the mac? <comment120362> can you explain how little snitch will be helpful? <comment137292> 2014: The status seems to still be the same as above commenter. No apps (not even saying good apps), for limiting bandwidth based on apps and not ports. <comment146295> This is a partially useful answer, in that identifying per-app traffic on Macs is not that easy.  Having shaping in same tool is ideal but not sure if that exists. <comment213909> NLC is great utility, thank you!
