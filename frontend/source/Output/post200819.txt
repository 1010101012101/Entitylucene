"iCloud Download" column in iTunes keeps reappearing <body> I updated my iTunes on my computer, and one of the things I noticed was that the "iCloud Download" column had now appeared on top of my music library. Now, I don't use iCloud for my music, so I right-clicked the bar and turned it off.  A few minutes later, the iCloud Download tab was back again. I could've sworn I'd turned it off, but just to be sure I right-clicked and turned it off again.  A few more minutes pass, and the iCloud Download tab is right there back again. Every time I turn it off, it just keeps reappearing sooner or later. I have Automatic Downloads for music checked off, so I don't know what is causing this.  This is very annoying. Does anyone know how to fix this?  <answer201019> Make sure you log out of the store after you've used it. Go to Store  Log Out and this should sort the problem.  <answer207328> I found an answer that doesn't require you stay logged out of the iTunes store (found here, whose poster found it here).   ul liIn iTunes, press kbdcommand/kbdkbd1/kbd or click codeMenubar/View/Music/code. /li liClick the codePlaylist/code button from the center-top row of the the iTunes window, below the large Apple logo. /li liClick codeMenubar/View/Only Music Available Offline/code. /li liRepeat for all other media types: kbdcommand/kbdkbd2/kbd or codeMenubar/View/Movies/code, kbdcommand/kbdkbd3/kbd or codeMenubar/View/TV Shows/code, etc./li liReturn to codeMusic Playlists/code, and the codeiCloud Download/code column is gone, no matter whether you're signed into the Store, no matter whether you've enabled/disabled Apple brand subscription-based streaming, and even after quit/relaunch of iTunes. /li /ul  <answer226172> I just removed it. And you must deactivate it from music, movies and TV for it to remove it  <comment242413> I really don't want to be logging in and out all the time, but if that's the only solution, then I guess I don't mind. <comment250018> I, for one, do mind. <comment250120> What a strange feature. Thanks! <comment250138> Tell me about. Or better, tell Apple: http://apple.com/feedback
