Send emails automatically to a list of contacts with specific attachment <body> I have the task of sending a standard email to a list of people. The hard part is that each email has a specific foto attached. My list is like this:  ol liJohn Snow, john@winterfell.com, johnSnow.jpg/li liAria Stark, aria@winterfell.com, ariaStark.jpg/li /ol  And my email looks like this:  precodeDear &lt;name&gt; &lt;surname&gt;,  bla bla bla. Find attachment &lt;fileName&gt;  thanks  &lt;attachment&gt; /code/pre  The list contains 150 people. How can I program or send this email? Is there an app or a script for doing this? or any online service?    For your reference: I know a bit of php, python, JS and shell scripting, maybe that helps.   THANKS!   PD. I asked at madmimi.com, but they can't attach specific files depending on the contact. All emails would have the same attachment, which I don't want.   <answer191221> You may want to play with standard MacOS X tool - Automator. Not a big expert myself :), but I know it helps in exactly this type of tasks. Here are couple of useful basic tutorials on Automator:   ul lihttp://www.macosxautomation.com/automator/learn.html/li lihttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z56PBanBSx4/li /ul
