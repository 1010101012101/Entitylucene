Can't create App Store account? <body> Every time I attempt to create an App Store account, I get the following error:  img src="https://i.imgur.com/0TpT9W2.png" alt="Apple."     strongYour session has timed out. Please try again./strong      Code: 5107   This error has persisted for weeks; I'm effectively locked out of the App Store, and everything that comes from it. (Which, as a developer, means a lot of things, since tons of stuff annoyingly depends on Xcode.)  <answer274277> All you need to use for an App Store account is your Apple ID.  If what you're trying to do is create an Apple ID and you keep running into Code: 5107 errors, you can try using a browser instead to create your Apple ID.  To do this:  ul liLaunch Safari (or your preferred web browser)/li liGo to: https://appleid.apple.com/account/li liComplete the form etc to create your Apple ID/li /ul  Once you've created your Apple ID (or if you already had an Apple ID), sign in to the App Store. You can do this as follows:  ul liLaunch the App Store app/li liClick on the Store menu/li liSelect Sign In.../li liEnter your Apple ID/li liEnter your Password/li liClick on Sign In./li /ul  If I've misunderstood your question, please let me know.  <answer282599> the trick is how you go to "Create account" page wizard ..  ul liopen iTunes then go to Apps/li lichoose a free app/li lichoose create account/li lifill your info/li lithen "None" will appear as a payment method, select it./li limake sure you enter right zip code for the country you selected/li /ul  and that's it.  <comment344711> Like `brew install macvim --with-override-system-vim`; apparently that requires Xcode… <comment344750> As a workaround, you can install Xcode-beta from https://developer.apple.com/download/. If that doesn't work then there must be something wrong with your Apple ID. <comment344950> I don't have an Apple ID yet; I'm stuck trying to create one. <comment357640> If I'm remembering right, this is the method that I was attempting to use; the error occurs after submitting the information on the payment screen (with None selected); i.e., after your last step. (I didn't realize prior to posting this question quite how many variations there were on creating an account.) <comment357708> Yep .. i was creating it from app store and it wont work but when i accsesed the page from iTunes it worked for me and that's weird ... <comment357724> This sounded like it could work, and it does get me an AppleID. However, if you attempt to use the ID to sign into the App Store, it says, "This Apple ID has not yet been used with the App Store."; it then proceeds to prompt for payment information (which I do not have), and the "None" option is not displayed. <comment357729> _Actually_, the None payment option appears if I try to upgrade a free app. (Just not if I just sign in normally…) Technically, I think that worked. (It said my account was now usable w/ the App Store or something) However, clicking any "Update" button just causes the button to grey out, and an AJAX spinner to appear, spin for a while, and then disappear. So, nothing works, but I think I technically have an account now, so I'm awarding you the magic Internet points. <comment357730> Oh, sorry, I missed the part about via iTunes. I tried a variation on Monomeeth's method, and that seemed to work, so I'm not able to test this anymore.
