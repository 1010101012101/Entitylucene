Terminal Failing to login <body> Suddenly, when I attempted to create a new terminal window, it fails. It does nothing for about a minute then shows only this:  precodeLogin incorrect login: /code/pre  Typing in my username doesn't work. I get the same message. Terminal was already up and running in another window. I just can't create any more.  My editor, IntelliJ, has a built in terminal and that's running fine.  <answer244476> I had a similar issue; the computer had been attached to Active Directory and the account had been disabled. I went ahead and disabled Active Directory by going into strongSystem Preferences/strong  strongUsers &amp; Groups/strong  unlocking the system to make changes and select strongNetwork Account Server:/strong and just deleted the Active Directory account.  <answer251200> Just a hunch: you might have too many pty's open (pseudo-teletype).   Happened to me while using Xcode, which apparently opened up too many terminal sessions in the background and prevented me from opening a new one.   If this happens again, you could try  precode  sudo sysctl -w kern.tty.ptmx_max=255 /code/pre  <comment235439> And it cleared itself up after 30 minutes. Weird. There was a scary minute when the login screen was exhibiting the same behavior. If anyone has a theory as to what might have happened, I'd be interested in hearing it. <comment235443> Your login shell might be broken. Try going to Terminal **Preferences**  **Startup tab**, and check that "Default Login Shell" Is selected. if it is, select "Command (complete path)" And type `login username`. You might have to enter password every time you view terminal. <comment246421> (Waited for enough rep to comment) a similar thing happened to me when I was using Terminal while a system update was installing; commands suddenly stopped working and I started to panic. After the update, which presumably had affected binaries, paths, etc, things went back to normal. I have the feeling this might have been what happened in your case. Did it work again?
