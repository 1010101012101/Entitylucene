But I'm not sure if they are comparable to my problems. They all about Bootcamp and boot loaders. - Sorry if I ask twice:  Fusion Drive seems to be messed up  I think I messed up the Fusion Drive on my 1TB iMac (with BootCamp)  I don't have any Timemachine Backup and If its possible I would also reinstall everything but I need some crucial data of the HDD.  strongEDIT:/strong  Added another Screenshot from Recovery Mode. Where you can see 1,11TB used for "Other". I had ~900GB free of disk space before this issue.  strongEDIT1:/strong  I can succesfully boot so single user mode kbdcmd/kbd + kbdS/kbd. I did prefsck -fy/pre and I got: “The volume (name) appears to be OK”. I could also see my whole file structure. Last I rebooted but same behaviour - so no luck here  strongEDIT2:/strongbr Output of codegpt -r show /dev/disk0/code and codegpt -r show /dev/disk1/code  img src="https://i.imgur.com/vwtFvy8.jpg" alt="gpt"  strongEDIT3:/strong    output of codedf/code:  precodeFilesystem  512-blocks        Used  Available Capacity   iused     ifree %iused  Mounted on /dev/disk2  2177413120   388991584 1787909536    18%  48687946 223488692  18%   / /code/pre  BTW: The number of emUsed blocks/em + emAvailable blocks/em + em512,000 blocks/em = number of 512-blocks.

Attach it to the broken Mac, boot to single user mode (kbdcmd/kbdkbdS/kbd while booting), mount the external drive and rsync your user folder and other important files &amp; folders to the external volume. Then erase Macintosh HD and reinstall OS X. strongYou may also rsync your complete system!/strong  Mounting an external drive to /Volumes (even though the boot drive is readable only) should be possible by using:  precodegpt -r show disk0/1/2 #search for the proper drive because *diskutil* won't work in SU mode /sbin/mount_hfs -o nosuid -w /dev/disk2s2 /Volumes/ #mount the external drive (e.g. disk2s2) to /Volumes rsync -aAvX /Users/user_name/ /Volumes/user_name #Backing up the user folder.  /code/pre  If the above rsync options don't work use something like codersync -aE .../code instead.  The root of the external drive is directly in /Volumes (so strongno/strong volume name in-between like on a normal system: /Volumes/Volume_name_ext_drive/).  After rsync'ing check the content of the "new" user folder.  (Tested in a VM)  <comment297775> 1. I would believe Macintosh HD is greyed out because it's not mounted. Select the greyed out partition and click mount in the toolbar. 2. The non-indented disks in the sidebar are physical disks, and if partitioned to fill the entire space, will appear as "100% full" with the name of the partition and its color beneath. Have you tried selecting your startup disk from Recovery (Apple Menu  Startup Disk)? <comment297791> Hi! Both not possible. 1. If i try to activate the Macintosh HD via Disk Utility it says "Please run First Aid. Can't Mount" (I can mount it via diskutil diskmount /dev .. but then there is just  a /Volumes/EFI Folder) 2. Apple Menu  Startup Disk. Its empty, can't choose from anything. <comment297800> Yes sure! First Aid is on my screenshot you can see above. It was the first thing i did. In Recovery Mode and in Internet Recovery Mode. Im stuck right now. <comment297806> EDIT: Added another Screenshot from Recovery Mode. Where you can see 1,11TB used for "Other". I had ~900GB free of disk space before this issue. <comment297814> Hi! Sure, I did a quick update in the thread above. Regards <comment297826> It fails here: /sbin/mount -uw / mount_hfs: error on mount): error = -1. Permission denied. And now i know why my disk is full. Stupid me, i did a video record in background yesterday and yes it filled up my space. Now I can't rm it because of read only mode <comment297834> @klanomath I edited your block with my current results. This is the output of df <comment297837> rsyncing all my files was my last possibility which i would try now but Is it even possible to mount an external Hard Drive in an Read-only file system? <comment297841> @kkern BTW your disk doesn't seem to be full - that's really a strange error! <comment297845> Thank you for you snippet. I needed to format (journal) the external drive on my macbook to mount it properly. Currently I'm rsyncing all my files. Will be back here after finishing.
