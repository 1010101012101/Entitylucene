What is the command sent by the home button on iPad bluetooth keyboards? <body> The top-left key on some bluetooth iPad keyboards functions as a home button. What happens when you connect the keyboard to a regular desktop and push the button, ie, what does the computer see? Is this some sort of command that could be replicated, say with a HID like the Teensy?  <answer104763> I found a Bluetooth keyboard designed for iPad and other platforms here.  The product pictures show two labels on the top row of keys.  The top left key is labelled with both the "home" roundrect icon and "Esc".  iPad Bluetooth keyboard http://f.cl.ly/items/1d3o0z1u2q1w0i1u3e2D/Screen%20Shot%202013-10-09%20at%2016.56.53.png  So I think it would be worth trying to send the key code for Escape.  <comment122950> Perhaps I've missed the point, but... I think it isn't possible to connect an iPad keyboard to a desktop computer.  The keyboard connects to the iPad via a dock connector (30 pin, or Lightning for newer models), and this doesn't appear on desktop computers.  Or: what have I missed? <comment123068> Whoop I meant bluetooth. Editing accordingly. (Most iPad keyboards are bluetooth. <comment123102> Can you provide a keyboard type? The Apple Keyboard does not have such a home-key. Have you tried catching your key codes using third party software? (http://manytricks.com/keycodes/) <comment123292> Sorry for the down vote, but I tested this in the inverse sense (Bluetooth keyboard on iPad), and it is not sending kbdEsc/kbd... Good guess, though. <comment123293> Good question... If VoiceOver is on, the iPad will accept control-option-H to go Home (and command-Tab works for app switching), but I couldn't get this or any key combo to work w/o VoiceOver, using a normal Bluetooth keyboard. If someone has one of those special keyboards, maybe they could try seeing what code is generated when connected to a desktop computer. <comment123309> Could somebody try using [the program @the manytricks link](http://manytricks.com/keycodes/) to test a keyboard with a home button and see if it gives any output?  Alternatively try punching the button in question into terminal/cmd and see what it spits out. <comment123310> On my apple keyboard (sans the home button) that simply sends an escape, which does nothing to the iPad. <comment123334> The keyboard might be 'smart' in the way that it knows the difference between a regular computer (esc) or an iPad (home) when sending the key signal using the bluetooth MAC address. <comment123519> From the highlighting, it appears that there is a "fn" key on the keyboard that would send the blue command if the "fn" is used as a modifier key. <comment123554> @MarkThalman That's a specific keyboard, not what we're looking for. Thanks though. <comment136157> I tried doing that on Many Tricks' Key Codes - the program does not capture output from pressing any key on the first row on the keyboard <comment137185> @user1565195 Did you try pressing the function key?
