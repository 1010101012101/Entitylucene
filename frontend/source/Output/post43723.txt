Windows-style taskbar functionality in OS X? <body> Looking for an OS X add-on that will enable Windows-like (one-click) functionality for switching between different windows of a single application.  Example: I have 5 maximized Chrome windows open, and wish to switch to a specific window. My current options are Exposé, the "Window" file menu, and Cmd-`. None of them are ideal because they take more than one click to execute, which is why I miss the taskbar in Windows. (For those of you unfamiliar with the taskbar, it displays a list of all your system-wide open windows similarly to how tabs are displayed in modern browsers.  So basically, I want to see a list of all of my open windows, and be able to toggle between them with a single click.   <answer43724> My solution to this is to not maximize windows: if I have one large window open in the middle, I'll leave ~50 pixels of open monitor on each side (less on the top) and I'll arrange ancillary windows (chat, terminal, Stickies, etc.) so various edges of them stick out beyond the edge of the big central window. Apps that have larger windows (browsers, email, etc.) that I access less-frequently I'll leave in the middle and click on the Dock icon to bring all of them forward and choose which one to use (usually, there's only one window in this sort of app in my normal usage).   If I have a ton of windows open in a certain app (usually BBEdit or Excel), I'll make sure none of them completely occlude another so I can, at the very least, get to any window in two clicks: one on the Dock icon and the second on an edge of the window I want; in some cases, I'll four-finger-swipe to get Exposé and then click on the document window I want.  <answer43727> Expose is the answer, you just need to configure it properly.  I use a trackpad (on my desktop mac!) and have a four finger swipe to bring up expose. With a mouse you might want to investigate activating expose with a screen corner or keyboard command (eg: left hand on the keyboard, right hand on the mouse).  Properly configured, expose is fast. It also gives you a bigger click target than the task bar.  There is no way to get the exact task bar functionality on OS X, you are going to have to learn a different workflow. But once you learn it, you'll be just as efficient.  <answer43730> I haven't seen anything quite what ur looking for, but Witch does a good job of rotating through all open windows whether they are minimized or not.  <answer43732> Using your Chrome example,  Hold CTRL and click on Chrome icon on the dock, it will bring up a list of Chrome Window that is currently opened.   <answer43754> Could perhaps HyperDock or DockView meet your needs?  <answer43771> And don't forget that holding down option when clicking between different application windows (or to the Desktop) will hide the app you're clicking out of.  If you're a OOTMOOTK (one on the mouse, one on the keyboard) type user, it makes a world of difference.  <answer89823> iTaskbar is a product that I'm affiliated with, so be sure to check out other's reviews of it. At the moment it's the only product in this category since creating a taskbar on OS X is not as trivial as on other operating systems. ;)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PzYYJ.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  We hope it will be helpful to all those people who, just like us, need a taskbar to work efficiently.  <answer90436> I do not have a mouse so cannot test using one.  strongWith a Trackpad/strong   You can use a gesture to swipe the "Application's Exxposé"  The "Application's Exposé" shows you thumbnails and scaled windows of the current Application.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aVvHL.png" alt="enter image description here"  Or if you hover over any app in the dock which has open windows (does not have to be the currently active) and use the gesture "Application's Exposé" will show you the windows for that app.  You can then click into one of them or gesture back to your current app.  Setup the gesture in the Trackpad preference pane in System Preferences  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zTS7K.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongUsing the keyboard/strong   You can do the same by setting a hot key to replace the gesture part. But it will only show the current apps windows.  This is set under the Application Windows in Mission Control preference pane in System Preferences.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vaZYJ.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer143073> try uBar, which is a Windows-style taskbar for OS X (I am the developer). Just set Window Grouping to Never in the preferences, and it will display each individual window in the bar.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KyMa4.png" alt="uBar, the taskbar for OS X"  <comment49727> What version of OSX are you using? Lion? Snow Leopard? <comment49753> +1 for HyperDock. If you like HyperDock, you might also like [HyperSwitch](http://bahoom.com/hyperswitch/) from the same developer, especially if you prefer keyboard shortcuts. It's still in beta, but I haven't had any issues so far. <comment105499> Please have a look at the [FAQ], especially the part about self-promotion. <comment105829> Sorry for having violated the rules. It's true that I'm affiliated to the product, I didn't know I had to state it. I just thought the link was exactly the answer to the question of the user. My bad :) <comment106148> Also are you using a Mouse or Trackpad <comment106541> @krav We have a very nice system where anyone can edit things.
