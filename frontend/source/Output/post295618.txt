Much appreciated!  <answer295620> The MacBook Pro (17-inch, Early 2011) has several output options. Which you can find on the Apple website: https://support.apple.com/kb/sp621?locale=en_US  ul liNative Mini DisplayPort output/li liDual display and video mirroring: Simultaneously supports full native resolution on the built-in display and up to strong2560 by 1600 pixels/strong on an external display, both at millions of colors/li /ul  Your display has two inputs:  ul liHDMI 1.4/li liDP1.2/li /ul  and a max resolution of strong2560 by 1440/strong  So I'd go for a mini-displayport to displayport 1.2 cable, like this one: https://www.startech.com/eu/Cables/Audio-Video/DisplayPort/6-ft-Mini-DisplayPort-to-DisplayPort-Adapter-Cable-Male-to-Male~MDP2DPMM6  <comment373822> Dear Volsk, Thank you very much for your detailed answer!
