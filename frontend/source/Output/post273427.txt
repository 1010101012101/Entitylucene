Restoring Windows 10 on a Macbook Pro 2016 <body> I had windows 10 running through bootcamp for a week and a half and I decided to run the updates.  Now when I try to boot my windows I see a black screen with the spinning dots, and it stays like this forever.  Is there anyway I can restore my windows 10 to a restore point through OSX?  Since I have this new Macbook Pro 2016 with display bar, I don't have any F keys, so I can't seem to be able to boot it in safemode?
