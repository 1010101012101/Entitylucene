ThunderBolt to Mini Display port <body> Is it possible to connect a strongemMacbook Air 2013/em/strong to strongemMacbook Pro 2009/em/strong through a thunderbolt cable in order to transform the latter to a second Display ?  <answer162506> According to Apples documents it is not capable on another Macbook.  It is called strongTarget Display Mode/strong and is supported on certain models of iMacs.  You can try third party apps that will turn an old computer into a second monitor.  I used the third party app "Air Display" and can say it worked great on Mavericks. (Haven't used in Yosemite).  It is a cost to download the app.  Apple Target Display Mode  AirDisplay  <answer162534> It's not possible for you to use either of your MacBook's as a second (external) display. Apple only allow the use of iMac's as secondary displays using a mode called "emTarget Display Mode/em".  No matter the use of ThunderBolt, Mini DisplayPort or any number of adapters you won't be able to achieve the result your looking for.  However there are several applications that do enable you to theoretically achieve this over the network (Air Display, AirParrot, MaxiVista, ScreenRecycler etc...) but none are a true replacement for a physical secondary display.
