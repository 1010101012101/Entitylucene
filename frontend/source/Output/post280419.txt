bash - is there a way i can change directory while omitting the default result of listing the contents of the directory <body> I have a script where i change directory alot, but the output is messy because it displays the file listing every time...is there anyway i can perform a change directory and not print the resulting file list.  For example:  precode&gt; |  =&gt; cd testDir     &gt; total 4 &gt; -rw-r--r--  1 tboland  staff     6B Apr 11 10:46 test1.txt /code/pre  I would prefer no response at all...like this  precode&gt; |  =&gt; cd testDir  ________________________________________________________________________________ | ~/testDir |  =&gt; /code/pre  My PS1 and PS2 is:  precode&gt; export PS1='_____________________________\n| \w \n| $(__git_ps1 "(%s)") =&gt; ' &gt; export PS2="| =&gt; " /code/pre  <comment352720> Please post the output of the following commands:  `echo $PROMPT_COMMAND` and `echo $PS1` to your original question.  I have a feeling you are executing the `ls` command somewhere in these settings. <comment352740> Thanks @Allan - I updated my question <comment352747> You have changed ~/.bash_profile to do something - what have you changed and why? ie do you understand what is in that file. If you don't I would (copy it as a backup) then delete the file and add lines from the backup that you need (and understand - even if it is by commenting a link to where the change came from) <comment352748> And the `PROMPT_COMMAND` variable?   Just as an aside..why you using a script to change directories - why not use an [alias](https://ss64.com/bash/alias.html) (man page)? <comment352749> What happens when you use a `\\` in front of cd- `\cd testDir`? <comment352866> @Mark - Thank you all...you are all correct,  im using a bash_profile i found on line with cool settings that i got a couple years ago when i got my first mac....now im starting with my own fresh blank profile...Thank you....you think i should delete this question? <comment353113> Maybe we should rephrase the question rather than delete it.
