Apache "Client denied by server configuration" <body> When I am running my codelocalsite/~user.name//code on OS X 10.7.5 it is loading the the correct page but in the log code/var/log/apache2/error_log/code it's recording this message.  precode[Fri Mar 14 00:17:07 2014] [error] [client ::1] client denied by server configuration: /usr/~ /code/pre  Here is my httpd-vhost configuration for localhost  precode&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;   ServerName localhost   DocumentRoot "~/Sites"   &lt;Directory  "~/Sites"&gt;     Options Indexes Multiviews     AllowOverride All     Order allow,deny     Allow from all   &lt;/Directory&gt;  &lt;/VirtualHost&gt; /code/pre  A check of codeapachectl -t/code shows no unexpected errors since I'm using localhost and don't need fully qualified DNS:     httpd: Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name, using MacBookPro.local for ServerNamebr   Syntax OK   I am serving plain text files with basic html in them. What could be the reason for this?  <answer124236> access to the directory on the hard disk was denied by an Apache... that can be an explicit deny directive, or if the dir is outside of document root.  I suspect you don't have (and don't want!) /usr as part of your documentroot.  <comment145241> What sort of web page is being served? Have you enabled cgi-bin or other changes to the apache config file? (also anything odd from apachectl -t) <comment145242> The page served is a plain html/text file. And the output from apachectl -t is following :-  httpd: Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name, using phillip-MacBookPro-344.local for ServerName Syntax OK <comment145244> My documentroot is the Sites folder in my home directory. <comment145245> Thanks @bmike for making it more accurate. <comment145247> You're most welcome. Let's see if people have ideas... I'm wondering if it's just a harmless error that some potential module might need to access /usr and the permissions are set to prevent that unless you enable that module (which presumably would change permissions or relax the check causing the "error") <comment145249> As is evident from the above config the DocumentRoot is the Sites folder in my home directory. How is /usr coming into picture here ? <comment145250> How can I find that module? Sorry I am pretty novice in these things. <comment145253> the request log shows /usr/~.   I think it is not interpreting ~ correctly as your home directory. <comment145255> Sure   I meant rather my documentroot does n't have that directory in the path.
