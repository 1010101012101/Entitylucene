Mac Outlook identity problem after upgrade to Mavericks <body> Upgrading a friends' 2011 MacBook Pro 15â€³ from Snow Leopard to Mavericks went as smooth as expected, however the single problem that's left concerns the Microsoft Outlook application.   There seems to be a problem with rebuilding the Main identity using the Microsoft Database Utility. I already tried to manually copy the essential parts to a new identity using finder and rebuilt it, so far without success. Every try ends in error [-18000]   The main identity has a size of approximately 10GB  Anybody experienced the same problem?
