Make meta + arrows count underscore as words? <body> I find myself using the kbdmeta/kbd + kbdarrow/kbd keys constantly.   When I am editing code, it would be nice if I could count underscores as words so that when I decide to rename a variable it goes to the character right after the underscore.  For example, if I have a variable named codeworkout_disabled_color/code, and I press kbdmeta/kbd + kbd&#8592;/kbd, and my cursor is currently at the end of "color", then it would go to the left of the character codec/code.  Is anybody aware of how I can do this?  <answer80504> Try modifying codenxhtml-mode-hook/code.  precode(add-hook 'nxhtml-mode-hook           (lambda () (modify-syntax-entry ?_ "w"))) /code/pre
