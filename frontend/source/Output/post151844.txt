Function keys since upgrading to Yosemite <body> kbdOption/kbd + kbdF1/kbd takes me to Display preferences, instead of using the current app binding, as it did in Mavericks. Is there any way to override this behavior?  I can't find the binding in Preferences - Keyboard - Shortcuts.  I see the binding on the Apple shortcut page, and I think it's always been there, but previously applications could overrule the setting.  If it's relevant, the app in question is IntelliJ Idea.  <answer151872> It turns out the problem came from the external keyboard, a Logitech K750. I had to use the Logitech Control Center to get the correct behavior. Why this wasn't a problem in Mavericks, I'm not sure.
