Macbook Pro Late 2011 15" Inc <body> I currently have a Macbook Pro late 2011 15 inch which is running Mac OS X 10.7.5 which is a little outdated for my preference. When I run a software update there it says there is no software update available and when I open my Appstore it crashes so I can not download the update for El Capitan. Does this version of the Macbook not support later versions of OS X? How can I get around this issue and download El Capitan?  <answer237716> Here's the requirements for upgrading to El Capitan.  Do you meet all the requirements, strongespecially the free space/strong?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8dEur.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer237718> http://www.apple.com/osx/how-to-upgrade/#hardware-requirements  El Capitan is usable for MacBoolPro Mid 2007 and newer, so yes your mac can run El Capitan
