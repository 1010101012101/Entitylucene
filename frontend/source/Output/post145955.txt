Xls to csv - Numbers creates multiple csv files for some reason <body> I have a small xls file which 200Kb of size. When I export it to csv format, Numbers creates multiple csv files. How do I make it create a single one?  <answer145971> CSV are simple text file where the data are only separated by comas and new lines.   There is no concept of sheets therefore Numbers need to create a csv for each sheet.   <comment171980> Does it have multiple sheets ? <comment171993> @MatthieuRiegler, yes, thanks.
