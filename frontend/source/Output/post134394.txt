safari sometimes can't load sites or sometimes it loads sites without css <body> I am a software developer experiencing strange errors with safari.  Sometimes safari loads some of the github.com pages without styles. The same happens with my heroku dashboard: https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps. But only sometimes.  With heroku I had much more stange errors: 'Safari can't load the url: heroku.com '  In chrome these errors never happen... I tried to load these pages in chrome immediately when I observed the error and for my biggest surprise in chrome everything was working. (I have fiber optic huge bandwidth internet so this is a very strange question.)  Any idea is welcome.  <answer134402> Try restoring safari to factory default:  ul liSettings/li liSafari/li liDelete history and data/li liCheck the strongadvanced/strong tab if everything is clear, else clear it./li /ul
