How to uninstall NTFS-free? <body> I'm a pc user that started using OS X a while ago.  I installed ntfs-free to be able to write in my external NTFS devices and it worked fine, but with the last OS X update it stopped working.  In order to directly use the built-in OS X driver for NTFS partitions I want to uninstall ntfs-free because I'm afraid it is preventing the driver to run.  As far as I know there is no program or library deleting app or functionality in OS X, so how can I do this?  <answer145044> Here's the official uninstall script:  precode#!/bin/sh  sudo rm -R /System/Library/Extensions/ntfs-free.kext sudo rm -R /sbin/mount_ntfs-free sudo rm -R /System/Library/Filesystems/ntfs-free.fs  if [ -f "/sbin/mount_ntfs_original" ]; then   sudo mv -f /sbin/mount_ntfs_original /sbin/mount_ntfs fi /code/pre  supSource: http://ftp.jaist.ac.jp/pub/sourceforge/n/nt/ntfsfree/uninstall.sh/sup
