Device (iPad) only detected on iTunes <body> My iPad is only detected by iTunes after I reset the lockdown folder. Photo Capture and Photos both said there is 0 device.  Before I reset the lockdown folder, even iTunes didn't detect my device.  I am using OS X 10.11.3 and I reseted the lockdown folder by deleting all files in the directory (not deleting the folder) code/var/db/lockdown/code if that helps.  Thanks  <comment276130> Apple says to delete the files.
