Cannot update HomeBrew: Permission denied <body> I am trying to fix some brew doctor error but now after manually erased some files that brew doctor suggested I get the following error when trying to do a brew update :  precodeerror: cannot open .git/FETCH_HEAD: Permission denied  Error: Failed to update tap: homebrew/versions Already up-to-date. /code/pre  <answer144797> I managed to fix this error by fixing the user owner of the /usr/local folder from 504 to Administrator (the user id I am using when I log in to macbook pro terminal). This was achieved by using this command :  sudo chown -R $USER:admin /usr/local  <comment170539> use `sudo` for the update? <comment170541> What are the permissions on `/usr/local/.git`? Sounds like you're perhaps sharing a machine and someone else updated homebrew and, in the course of doing that, took ownership of the `/usr/local` directory tree. <comment170549> No the macbook pro is mine.I am not sharing with anybody else.The permissions of /usr/local/.git are Administrator staff
