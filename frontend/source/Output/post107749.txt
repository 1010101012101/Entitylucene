Mavericks SSH keys and Keychain <body> Before Mavericks I could use Keychain to store my SSH keyfile passwords  The connection between private key and Keychain was like this:  ssh-add -K /path/of/private/key  However now in Mavericks, the -K option has been removed.  Of course, I can skip the "-K" option and manually copy paste the password every time I start my computer... but I would rather use the keychain method again.  How can I use Keychain for my ssh private file passwords again? Is it down in a different way now?  <answer107758> Are you sure you aren't using codessh-add/code from another source?  On my Mavs, codessh-add/code—which is code/usr/bin/ssh-add/code—does have the code-K/code flag.  It's in the manpage, shows in the usage message, and is accepted.  Check codewhich ssh-add/code to see if you're pulling in codessh-add/code from elsewhere due to your codePATH/code.
