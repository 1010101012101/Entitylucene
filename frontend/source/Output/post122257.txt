Removing shutdown and sleep button from the Apple menu on Mavericks <body> I'm trying to remove the "Sleep" and "Shutdown" entries from the Apple menu. So far I managed to do it by editing code/System/Library/Frameworks/Carbon.framework/Frameworks/HIToolbox.framework/Versions/A/Resources/English.lproj/StandardMenus.nib/objects.xib/code but that solution is quite ugly. It can be a cause of some instabilities?  I tried the following commands:  precodesudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow ShutDownDisabled -bool true sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow ShutDownDisabledWhileLoggedIn -bool True /code/pre  but they don't seem to work anymore (I used this in Mountain Lion). I wondered if there was any better way to do disable those entries.  <answer250927> Not sure about Shut Down but you can disable Sleep using pmset:  precodesudo pmset -a disablesleep 1 /code/pre  This will gray out the Sleep menu item as well.  https://support.apple.com/en-lb/HT200106  <comment222924> Why do you want to do this? Is your Mac in a lab? <comment306294> Some interesting commands here: https://derflounder.wordpress.com/2013/01/27/disabling-the-sleep-command-in-the-apple-menu/, for anyone still interested. <comment311795> This does not answer the OP's question.  The question is how to remove the command from the Apple menu, not prevent the Mac from sleeping. - From Review - <comment311805> As mentioned in the linked article, it grays out the Sleep menu item too..  :) <comment311810> Please add all the relevant information to your answers in order to make them more useful.
