How to bridge vboxnet with Wi-Fi on OS X 10.10 "Yosemite" <body> I am trying to bridge two interfaces on OS X 10.10 "Yosemite" but somehow this does not seem to work for virtual interfaces:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gMJI4.png" alt="enter image description here"  The network on Virtualbox goes over "Host Only Network"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/F9Jwy.png" alt="enter image description here"  Is there a way to overcome this? I want to bridge 192.168.56.1 with the Wi-Fi in order to make my virtual machines visible to other computers on the internet.  <answer201184> VirtualBox and OS X provide several (no-NAT) methods to connect your VM:  strong1. The VirtualBox "Bridged Adapter":/strong  First remove bridge1 in Terminal and use a "Bridged Adapter" instead of vboxnet0 in your VM. Go to the Network settings of the respective VM - Adapter1 - attached to: and change the type from whatever it is now to "Bridged Adapter" then choose your Wi-Fi interface:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4wGUI.png" alt="network settings vm virtualbox"  The VM's en0 attached to the bridged adapter has to be configured with a unique IP in the same network range as the hosts interface IP.  Example:    ul liMy hosts en1 config: network: 192.168.1.0/24 IP: 192.168.1.2 gateway: 192.168.1.1/li liThe VM's eth0 config: network: 192.168.1.0/24 IP: a free and unique IP-address in the range 192.168.1.3-192.168.1.254 gateway: 192.168.1.1/li /ul  If you want to make the VM accessible to other computers in the WAN (internet) (e.g. a web-server) you have to forward the respective ports in the router to the VM's IP. The VM can be accessed by all other computers in the same network (192.168.1.0/24) in your LAN directly.  Finally it looks like this:  precodeWAN &lt;---&gt; Router/Switch (&amp; port fw to VM) &lt;----&gt; Mac &lt;-------&gt; VM            192.168.1.1                      192.168.1.2   192.168.1.130                 ¦                 ¦              other Mac(s)            192.168.1.3|4|5...  /code/pre  strong2. The OS X bridge/strong  I assume en1 is your Wi-Fi interface and eth0 is the first adapter in your (Linux-)VM. Check this with codeifconfig/code on your VM-host. Please adapt the commands and change the interfaces below if necessary.  If you don't want to use "Bridged Adapter" but vboxnet0 do the following after starting VirtualBox:  Attach the VM adapter 1 to the "Host-only Adapter" and the "Name" vboxnet0.  On the host in Terminal enter:  precodesudo sysctl -w net.inet.ip.forwarding=1 sudo ifconfig bridge1 destroy #if bridge1 still exists sudo ifconfig en1 down sudo ifconfig vboxnet0 down sudo ifconfig bridge1 create sudo ifconfig bridge1 addm vboxnet0 addm en1 sudo ifconfig bridge1 192.168.1.2 netmask 255.255.255.0 up /code/pre  In the VM (Linux) you have to configure an IP-address and a default route:  precodesudo ipconfig eth0 192.168.56.101 netmask 255.255.255.0 arp sudo route add default gw 192.168.56.1 /code/pre  A configured "Network Manager" might interfere with those settings.  On the various Macs in your network you have to configure an additional static route:  precodesudo route -n add -net 192.168.56.0/24 192.168.1.2 /code/pre  On the router your have to forward ports to the VM and add a static route to 192.168.56.0/24 to make the VM accessible to other computers in the WAN (internet).   Finally it looks like this:  precodeWAN &lt;---&gt; Router/Switch (&amp; port fw to VM &amp; static route to 192.168.56.0/24) &lt;-----&gt; Mac &lt;----------------------&gt; VM            192.168.1.1                                                    192.168.1.2|192.168.56.1   192.168.56.101 (&amp; default gw or static route to 192.168.1.0/24)                 ¦                 ¦              other Mac(s)            192.168.1.3|4|5... (&amp; static route to 192.168.56.0/24) /code/pre  The bridge and the various routes (except those on the router and the default gateway of the VM) don't survive a reboot.  To roll-back all changes:  To remove bridge1 on the host do the following:  precodesudo ifconfig bridge1 down sudo ifconfig bridge1 deletem en1 deletem vboxnet0 sudo ifconfig bridge1 destroy /code/pre  To disable forwarding on the host do the following:  precodesudo sysctl -w net.inet.ip.forwarding=0 /code/pre  To remove static routes on the Mac enter:  precodesudo route -n delete -net 192.168.56.0/24 192.168.1.2 /code/pre  Remove the static route on the Router.  hr  As a result one might say it's much easier and much more comfortable to use method 1.  <comment242490> I am not sure if this is true for vboxnet0 (host only network). <comment242492> yes, since lauch. Works perfectly. This is another interface by the way. Goto: preferences - network. <comment242570> I have created the bridge1 as you described and it shows up in ifconfig bridge1 correcly. However, I can not reach the VM from another computer by 192.168.56.150. The shared subnet is 192.168.0.1. I have also tried it with the changed attached adapter like you showed, but then the VM has no access to anywhere. Alll pings fail. <comment242671> @merlin I completely reworked my answer to get everything working
