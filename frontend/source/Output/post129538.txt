Different results of running the same AppleScript <body> The script is:  precodetell application "DEVONthink Pro"     activate end tell  tell application "System Events"     tell process "DEVONthink Pro Office"         tell menu bar 1             tell menu bar item "Data"                 tell menu "Data"                     tell menu item "Open With"                         tell menu "Open With"                             click menu item "Preview (default)"                         end tell                     end tell                 end tell             end tell         end tell     end tell end tell /code/pre  If run direct from the AppleScript Editor, it would work as expected, i.e. open the selected file with Preview. But if run from DEVONthink itself, it would do nothing except pause the application for some seconds.  Why is this happening? How to get it work as expected?  <answer218533> The problem strongemmay be/em/strong quite simply that your compiled applescript is strongemnot privileged/em/strong to access DEVONthink-Pro's menus - but ScriptEditor strongemis/em/strong ...br br Have a look into: &nbsp; System-Preferences-app / Security &amp; Privacy / Privacybr ... and select "Accessibility" in the list on your left.br  Now you can add your compiled app to the "privileged list" on the right side.
