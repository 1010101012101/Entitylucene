could you force install OSX Mavericks onto a Apple MacBook A1181 early 2008 model if running snow leopard or mountain lion osx <body> iv just bought an Apple MacBook A1181 (white) early 2008 model and was wondering if i could install mavericks on it? in any way shape or form?  <answer135780> To install Mavericks, you need one of these Macs:  precodeiMac (Mid-2007 or later) MacBook (13-inch Aluminum, Late 2008), (13-inch, Early 2009 or later) MacBook Pro (13-inch, Mid-2009 or later), MacBook Pro (15-inch or 17-inch, Mid/Late 2007 or later) MacBook Air (Late 2008 or later) Mac mini (Early 2009 or later) Mac Pro (Early 2008 or later) Xserve (Early 2009)  /code/pre  Your Mac also needs:  precodeOS X Mountain Lion, Lion, or Snow Leopard v10.6.8 already installed 2 GB or more of memory 8 GB or more of available space /code/pre  There are some attempts reported how to Force Install on non compatible models, but the result is more of a waste of time then a working computer.  <comment160969> did you do any research, have you tried anything ? <comment160974> see also http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/57698/will-mountain-lion-run-on-an-early-2008-macbook-white
