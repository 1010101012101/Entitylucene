Hostname changes in the terminal when connecting to some wifi networks <body> When I connect to some wifi networks my computer hostname changes in the terminal - is this normal? Is there a way I can prevent this from happening?  <answer50035> OS X normally gets the hostname from a reverse lookup of the IP address the machine has. When you're on DHCP, that means your hostname can change. If you want to force a hostname, you can edit /etc/hostconfig (use the cli editor of your choice, you'll need to use sudo) and change strongHOSTNAME=-AUTOMATIC/strong- to strongHOSTNAME=NameYouWant/strong  <answer55589> On Lion (at least), the best way to achieve this is by running scutil:  precodesudo scutil --set HostName NAME /code/pre  replacing NAME with the hostname you want. Note that code/etc/hostconfig/code is deprecated, if you can believe a comment at the top of the file.   <comment57508> When I did this, a lot of tools I use in the command line all broke...seems they stored the hostname. Is that common? <comment63790> @ChrisAbrams: I don't think that's common, but it's hard to say more without knowing what broke, and how. (I know it's a long time since you asked. I saw this just now.) <comment149509> This fix still works on Mavericks if anybody is interested. Thanks for the tip!
