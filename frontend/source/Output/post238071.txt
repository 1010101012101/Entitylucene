Weird time format in Quick Time <body> I have time displaying like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/c2oHV.png" alt="enter image description here"  in some my videos in strong.mp4/strong format (not at all of them). What is it about &amp; how to change it to normal view? OS X 10.11.4  P.S. All is fine in strongElmedia Player/strong (it's the same video opened).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zecbf.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment291817> Do all videos played in QT have a messed-up time format or just this one? <comment291818> No, some have & some don't. <comment291849> What duration and position should it actually be? <comment291911> Please, see the updated original post. <comment291913> Does this happen for videos less than an hour long? And to check a theory, what language/region is your system in? Do you use 12-hour or 24-hour time in your system? <comment291931> Nope, it happens in videos that are longer than 1 hour, I think & use 12-hour time in my machine. I try to change the time to 24 format & everything changes to what I want, but, what's happened in 12-hour format? <comment292088> @k1r8r0wn QuickTime Player has had an issue with certain Language/Region configurations for the past few releases of OS X (it really hasn't been updated much since 2014). What happens varies, for example it shows "aK:00:00" on my Japanese configuration.
