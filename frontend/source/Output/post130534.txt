Facebook app on IOS won't update some threads <body> Many threads that I visit frequently at some point stop updating. I get the notifications that someone has commented on the subject but when I click the link I can't see the latest changes. Even if I go back to the thread several weeks later I can't see anything after the point where the thread stopped from updating. As far as I know there is no app cache that can be cleaned or similar. How can I achieve to start updating those threads again? This doesn't happen with all threads just some. If I go into Safari I can see the changes after where the app stopped updating the thread.  My info: iPhone 5s, iOS 7.1 Facebook version 9.0.0.25.31  Thanks for suggestions!  <answer130564> Sadly it's delete and reinstall.   I recommend Facebook's Paper app which behaves itself and provides a better interface IMHO https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/paper-stories-from-facebook/id794163692?mt=8  <comment153510> Delete and install solved it. But using the app two days I have again a tread that locked up. Terrible. I might try the Paper app.
