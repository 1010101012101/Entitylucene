Launching server.app logs "Could not find image named 'XSMail'" in system.log, should this be fixed? <body> Launching the Server.app version 1.5.0 (Mac OS X 10.7.5) creates these lines in the system.log every time:  precodeServer[24746]: Could not find image named 'XSMail'. Server[24746]: Could not find image named 'XSiCal'. Server[24746]: Could not find image named 'XSAddressBook'. /code/pre  This machines always fails to "Enable Apple push notifications" without supplying any error message and mostly fails to load the server its "Settings" tab. Loading settings is usually only good on first launch after reboot.  Are these the "Server" strongCould not find image named 'XSMail', 'XSiCal' and 'XSAddressBook'/strong serious enough that these should be fixed? When Could not find image named log lines should be fixed, how to fix the issue?  <comment126072> Already found how to fix: copy `Mail.app`, `iCal.app` and `AddressBook.app` to the `Applications` folder.
