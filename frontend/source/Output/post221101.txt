Repeating a formula for every row in Pages <body> I'm working on a simple formula in Pages where I have a table with 4 cells per row.  Product Name, Purchase Price, Quantity and Total. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pOxxA.png" alt="enter image description here"  I've created a simple formula that multiples Purchase Price with Quantity and displays the result in the Total row.  My problem is that I am at this time unaware of how many rows I will be requiring. So my questions is, is it possible to every new row I create inherit these properties / this formula when added?  <answer221163> If I'm not mistaken, tables have a small yellow dot on the highlight box at the bottom once selected.  Clicking and dragging this dot downwards will duplicate the rows (and hence their enclosed formulae).
