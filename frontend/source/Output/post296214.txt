How to ensure that all applications use system proxy (SOCKS5 proxy) <body> I am trying to ensure that all traffic from application running in the system is routed through a system proxy.   I have set a SOCKS5 proxy server in Network Preferences code(Advanced -&gt; Proxies -&gt; Socks5 Proxy)/code.  Some applications respect the settings but other don't. In my case all browsers work through proxy, but other applications (mostly command-line) don't use proxy and traffic is sent without proxyfying. For example, strongnodejs, curl/strong.  How can I force all application to use proxy or don't send any request at all ?   I would be grateful for any help
