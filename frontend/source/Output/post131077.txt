OS X 10.9 - Home Directory for Share Only Account? <body> I created a new Share Only user account but I am not able to find the home directory for this account in Finder, or under /Users.  I know for sure that the account was created correctly, because when I try to recreate the same Share Only Account, the system tells me that an account of this type already exists.  Where can I find the home directory for this specific account?  My other accounts (Standard User Account, Administrative User Account and Parental Control User Account) appear in the /Users directory.  <answer131082> Sharing Only accounts do not have home folders. Home folders are really only used during a local login session, and Sharing Only users cannot log in locally, there's no real point to having one.  If you want a Sharing Only account to have a their own private file storage location, create a folder (where doesn't really matter), use System Preferences - Sharing pane - File Sharing service to add it to the shared folder list, then set the owner to the Sharing account (and optionally limit access for other users).
