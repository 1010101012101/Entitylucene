Enabling BitLocker without TPM on MacBook Pro with Bootcamp <body> I have been wanting to enable BitLocker without a compatible TPM (my MacBook Pro) on a Bootcamp partition that has read / write access to the EFI. Is there a way to do this?  <answer292900> I wanted to document this because the information that I've found is spread out and highly complicated. I've found a set of steps that are much simpler to enable BitLocker on a Bootcamp install of Windows. I've combined the information from these two sources for this guide:  ul liHow do I mount the EFI partition on Windows 8.1 so that it is readable and writeable?/li liBitlocker in Windows 8.1 inside Bootcamp on the MacBook Pro (mid 2009)/li /ul  The first step is to boot into your Windows partition, then log in, and open up an administrative command prompt.  Mount the UEFI partition to a drive letter:     codemountvol b: /s/code  Copy the Microsoft EFI binaries to the UEFI partition:     codebcdboot c:\windows /s b: /f UEFI/code  Unmount the UEFI partition:     codemountvol b: /d/code  Configure BitLocker to work without a TPM:  ol liStart = run = codegpedit.msc/code/li liOpen the Local Computer Policy node/li liNavigate to codeComputer Configuration \ Administrative Templates \ Windows Components \ Bit Locker Drive Encryption \ Operating System Drives/code/li liDouble click on codeRequire additional authentication at startup/code/li liEnable the feature and check the box next to codeAllow BitLocker without a compatible TPM/code, click Apply and Ok, and close out of Local Group Policy Editor./li /ol  Reboot your machine back to Windows.  You can now enable BitLocker on the device using just a passphrase.  <comment369554> Thanks @bret7600 for the edits and nice work kop48
