How do I remove crashplan from my Mac <body> I recently tried out CrashPlan on my Macbook, but I decided not to go through with that.  However, now that I'm not going to be using CrashPlan after all, I can't figure out how to remove their app from my Mac.  I've tried simply opening up Finder and moving it to Trash but I get the following error when I try that:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/497ej.jpg" alt="an error stating that the operation cannot be performed because I lack the permission to access the item in question"  I've also tried deleting it from the command-line using coderm -rf CrashPlan.app/code; even when I run this as root, I still get:  precoderm: CrashPlan.app/Contents: Operation not permitted rm: CrashPlan.app: Operation not permitted /code/pre  I also tried doing this with the GNU version of coderm/code, but I still get an error:  precodegrm: cannot remove ‘CrashPlan.app/Contents’: Operation not permitted /code/pre  I ran, codeget info/code on the CrashPlan app in Finder, and I noticed this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/duZTE.jpg" alt="shows that the crashplan app is locked"  However, when I uncheck the codelocked/code field and then try to move it to Trash, I still get the same error that I got the first time.  Any ideas?  <answer121626> On OSX the root user is disabled for security reasons. codesudo/code might work, but if not, you can try the following. You need to login as administrator user. On my system, the default user (rxt) is not admin. So I need to do codesu adminuser/code, after which the adminuser password is needed. This makes you administrator, but not root. Now you can become root by using codesudo -i/code. In some situations this is different from using codesudo/code plus coderm/code or some other command. If you need more rights, become root by using codesudo -i/code!   <answer121628> Since Crashplan runs with elevated / non-standard permissions for an ordinary app, you will want to:  ol liReinstall the same or newer version of the software to correct whatever changes non-standard or half-removed. (Free download from http://www.code42.com/store/)/li liRun the uninstaller that is inside the package contents of the app. (Documented https://support.code42.com/CrashPlan/Latest/Getting_Started/Uninstalling_The_CrashPlan_App)/li liOptionally delete these two folders if they exist:  ul li~/Library/Application Support/CrashPlan/li li/Library/Application Support/CrashPlan/li /ul/li /ol  <answer121645> A much easier solution is to simply run the included uninstaller on the disk image.  <answer130572> Um.  I just went to the folder Library/Applicationsupport/CrashPlan and clicked on the uninstaller icon.  It uninstalled and it is gone now.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0esRr.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer144930> CrashPlan app contains an uninstaller built in. You can access the Uninstaller app by following the steps below :   ol liGo to Applications/li liControl Click on CrashPlan App &amp; choose Show Package Contents/li liGo to Contents Folder/li liLocate Uninstall app &amp; double click to run it/li liAuthenticate using Administrator password &amp; wait for it to complete/li /ol  This whole process should be over it a minute or two.  <answer156397> I had this same exact problem and no amount of "uninstalling" would get this pesky application file to DELETE.  I even connected this Mac in Thunderbolt Target Mode to another Mac and tried to delete it that way.  No go.  I was at my wit's end, almost ready for a complete system backup, wipe and re-install.  Fortunately before getting that far, I was able to fix it by removing the "system immutable flag" via Terminal.app, using the "chflags noschg" command.  In the terminal:  precodecd ~/.Trash/ chflags -R noschg * rm -fR * # or empty via Finder /code/pre  <answer157671> I couldn't trash Crashplan, either. And when I did option/click, revealing the Package Contents, the uninstaller wouldn't work.  What worked for me was redownloading &amp; reinstalling Crashplan. Then I did the option/click thing, ran the new uninstaller, and this seems to have completely removed Crashplan, including the pre-existing app that I couldn't get to move to the Trash.   <answer169912> I couldn't remove Crashplan also, tried delete, show contents and run uninstaller no success. Downloaded the app again and you get a new uninstall option. This worked a treat.  <answer175419> I had the same problem. Fastest solution and worked on both computers was:  (a) Go to http://www.code42.com/store/ (b) Download free version of CrashPlan (c) After clicking to install the pop-up with the application symbol (that you drop into your Applications folder) also has a small trashcan in the bottom right corner. (d) After installation complete click the uninstall trashcan. (e) All old and new crashplan files get removed instantly.  <answer199508> There are other reasons for wanting to delete a specific CrashPlan.app  I am in this camp. I have a backup copy of CrashPlan.app this is created by backup software and sometimes I need to delete the backup file and I get into the probem space of the question.  In this case, I am not deleting the primary CrashPlan.app and thus all the advice about uninstall does not apply.  Here is what I had to do:  precode# Change directory to the particular trashed or non-trash resident CrashPlan.app cd /Volumes/Mavericks_NonSSD/_CCC SafetyNet/2015-08-05/Applications/CrashPlan.app/  sudo chflags -R noschg * sudo rm -r Contents/ cd .. sudo rm -fR CrashPlan.app/ ls -lsaG /code/pre  All is good now for me....  I actually had to remove the CrashPlan.app from the trashcan and put it back where I deleted it from to get this to work, but it should not be necessary.  <answer225759> In terminal copy  sudo rm -R /Applications/CrashPlan.app enter password, done. You will still see the app icon but all process are stopped for good; for what I can see.   <answer227063> ol liOpen the Finder./li liPress kbdCommand/kbd kbdShift/kbd kbdG/kbd/li liA dialog box appears: Go to the folder./li liPaste this text into the dialog box:br Installed for everyone: code/Library/Application Support/CrashPlan/Uninstall.app/codebr Installed per user: code~/Library/Application Support/CrashPlan/Uninstall.app/code/li liClick Go./li liDouble-click Uninstall./li liFollow the prompts to complete the uninstall process./li liRemove the following directory from your system:br Installed for everyone: code/Library/Application Support/CrashPlan/codebr Installed per user: code~/Library/Application Support/CrashPlan/code​/li /ol  <answer245073> I used this and it worked for me:  precodecd /Applications/CrashPlan.app/Contents/.Uninstall.app/Contents/Resources sudo chmod u+x uninstall.sh sudo ./uninstall.sh /code/pre  <comment141786> Have you tried the Standard Uninstall procedure listed here: https://support.code42.com/CrashPlan/Latest/Getting_Started/Uninstalling_The_CrashPlan_App <comment141802> @Deesbek yes, I ran all the `rm` commands above as root; I'm pretty sure that I even said that I had run them as root. <comment171228> Downloading a 50 Mb file is last thing people want to do to get rid of something. The uninstaller is included in the .app  Show Package Contents. <comment198062> This worked for me, but I had to run it as a sudo command: `sudo chflags -R noschg *` <comment198293> I followed what harmon said above to redownload, but the install screen now comes with an uninstall option by double clicking a trash can instead of reinstalling the application. <comment249040> Simple and effective. Worked like a charm.
