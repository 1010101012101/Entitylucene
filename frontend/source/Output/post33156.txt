Avoid automatic shutdown <body> I have a MacBook Pro running Lion. Usually, I need to run tasks that takes hours... so I just leave the laptop working before going to bed.  When I wake up, I notice that it tried to shutdown the system. How do I notice this? Well... all apps are closed except for iTerm (which always stops shutdown process when there is more than one tab open).  I tried to search the energy saving settings but there is nothing related to this... I would like to see how to prevent this behavior.  <answer33170> ol liMake sure your power adapter is connected to the Mac while you are sleeping./li liIn the Power Adapter section in Energy Saver, make the "computer sleep" - "never"./li liYou don't want your screen is on when you are in bed right? So make "Display sleep" - some minutes./li liUncheck "Put the hard disk(s) to sleep when possible" and "Restart automatically if the computer freezes"./li /ol  That should work!  <answer206813> You can also temporarily disable sleep from the command line with "caffeinate" regardless of the sleep settings in system preferences.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GMPup.jpg" alt="caffeinate"  The basic function of caffeinate when run without any arguments it to prevent active sleep while caffeinate is running:  precodecaffeinate /code/pre  It will prevent active sleep until you stop caffeinate with "Control + C" or kill all caffeinate processes. After termination the MacBook will resume its normal behaviour (perfect for a computational intensive task)  You can also run caffeinate for a specific pre-determined amount of time to prevent sleeping for that specific amount of time e.g. 4 hours (specify time in seconds) - The ampersand makes the terminal run the process in the background so you continue working.  precodecaffeinate -t 144000 &amp; /code/pre  Caffeinate can also be attached to other commands to prevent the MacBook from sleeping while the given command is being executed:  precodecaffeinate [command_to_run] -arguments /code/pre  For a full list of options please refer to the man-page
