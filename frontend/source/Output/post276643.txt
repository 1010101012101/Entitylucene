I normally download IPSW and update using iTunes so that the updates do not take all the internet bandwidth.  I would like to know if it's possible create our own server and publish those updates such that users can update their phone by Wi-Fi. That way instead of downloading updates directly from Apple it will download from my private server.  <answer276645> You can run the Caching service, part of server.app. The Caching service supports OTA updates for iOS 7 and later.
