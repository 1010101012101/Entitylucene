Is there a way to copy the link URL in Safari (Mac OS X) without using right click? <body> In Safari, if you want to copy the link URL, you should do 3 operations:  ol liHover the link/li liRight-click the link /li liUse the "Copy link" item from the main/contextual menu/li /ol  Alternatively, you can hover/navigate to the link and then select the link (usually if textual) by using the mouse/trackpad. Then you hit CMD+C and have the link copied, but these are still 3 operations (navigate/hover, select, copy).   So, the question: Is there a way in Safari to reduce the above to just 2 operations:  strong1) Hover/strong and strong2) Copy/strong ?  It seems there are similar tools/plugins for Firefox and Chrome:  ul liChrome: Copy link address/li liFirefox: Copy URL on Mouse Over/li /ul  There is even a plugin for Safari which does something similar, but not exactly: emType to navigate/em. The issue is that this plugin is not designed to solve the above problem, so even though the plugin allows you to copy the link you have selected, it is not solving the real problem - how to reduce the steps to just 2 (hover and copy).  Ideas are welcome!  <answer90742> Is there a wider description of your use case for this, or is this the only function you'd like to have in Safari?    i.e. You can use an Automator action to return all links and pass that to another action, if you are trying to pick up all links in a page via codeGet Link URLs from Webpages/code if you are attempting to automate grabbing links emin general/em, not just the one you are hovering over.  <answer90744> Depending on what you are trying to do with the link, it may be sufficient to drag it. If you click and drag a link in Safari, you can drop it in many places and get the desired functionality. For example, if you drop it in a text editor, it will drop the link URL (for plain text) or a formatted link using the title from the page. If you drop it on your desktop, you will get a webloc file. If you drop it on the Safari URL bar or tab, that tab will load the link.  If you really need to copy the link, one possibility is to use spotlight as a easy-access text field. Start dragging the link, hit kbdCommand/kbd+kbdspace/kbd (or whatever you have it set to) to pop up spotlight, drop it in the search field, and copy.  <answer231196> Select Command-L That will highlight the URL field Then just select Command-C to copy.  This is the quickest keyboard shortcuts I have found.  <comment106654> Thanks @ughoavgfhw - using drag & drop would certainly help! <comment106655> I want to copy a specific (usually one or several, but not all) links from a given page and paste it in Mail.app. Imagine creating a status report via e-mail, in which you want to provide links (URLs) to the concrete issues in a web-based tracking system. <comment106824> The Mac still relies on Drag and Drop, though a lot of this remains unspoken. Having two open app windows visibleâ€”-Safari and Mail, for example--allows drag and drop of not only links but images and sometimes text selections. Sometimes dropping on the Desktop as intermediate step--but experiment! <comment342131> What about Google search URLs? It will not work for them...
