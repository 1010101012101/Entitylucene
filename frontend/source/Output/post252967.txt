How to Show Apple Wallet without Apple Pay — Boarding Passes Only (iOS 10) <body> In Australia, Apple Pay is not widely supported, so the credit card facility is not of much use at this time. On the other hand, the two major domestic airlines certainly support Apple Wallet with their boarding passes.  The question is:  (a) Is it possible to hide the credit card section, or, at least, to move it below the boarding passes? (b) Is this why the double-click short cut doesn’t work to show the Wallet from the lock screen?  <answer253044> For devices supporting Apple Pay, the feature cannot be disabled and is shown at the top of the Wallet app. There is no option to hide the feature or disable it using Restrictions.  Double-clicking the home button only works if there is a card in Apple Pay, upon which the default Apple Pay card is shown and other Wallet cards/passes can be presented. Unfortunately without any Apple Pay card this feature is unavailable.  <comment314925> Bummer. Thanks.
