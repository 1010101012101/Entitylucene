Why doesn't the screen command source my .profile? <body> When I start a new screen, the aliases that I have set in my code~/.profile/code do not seem to be sourced.  Does anyone know where I can change this or which file is actually read when starting a new screen?  <answer55758> For an alias to work in ~/.profile the session needs to be a login shell. Bash, which is probably what you're using, is typically read from ~/.bash_profile.  There's a good explanation of the differences mentioned here:  https://superuser.com/questions/183870/difference-between-bashrc-and-bash-profile  <answer258109> Apple uses ~/.bash_profile as mentioned above. If you want bash inside screen to behave exactly as the Apple Terminal, create a ~/.bashrc file with the command  precodesource /etc/profile /code/pre  which will include all Apple settings.   <comment63996> Doesn't `screen -l` work?
