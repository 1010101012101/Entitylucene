downloaded all photos from iCloud on iPhone, but little downloading clock keeps appearing <body> I have 1063 photos on iCLoud. I bought an iPhone SEand logged on to my iCloud with it. All the photos show up in my photos app. However, when I scroll through my photos, every photo has a low quality and I can see a downloading icon in the bottom right corner. My question is how I can download all photos in once, because right now I have to view each photo individually to see that little downloading clock appear in the bottom right corner, otherwise they do not download themselves onto the phone itself.
