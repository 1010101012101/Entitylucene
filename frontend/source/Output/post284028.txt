Can't trim an H.264 movie produced by avconv with Quicktime <body> I've already used Quicktime a lot to trim videos (cut away the part before the start and after the end of the sequence I want to keep). But now I wanted to do the same, I can set the mark, cut, but I can't remove the piece. Usually I can mark one of the parts after the split and press backspace to delete it, but with these movies nothing happens.  They are code.mov/code with h.264 and aac streams, as all the other files were, but what's different: They are converted by codeavconv/code. Could that matter? And what can I do about it?  <comment358173> Could you perhaps also post a screenshot of the Movie Inspector window for a video that's not working, in case somebody here can spot something odd? Probably also worth checking Console.app for any messages that appear when you press backspace to delete. If all else fails, you could always try to trim the video in iMovie instead.
