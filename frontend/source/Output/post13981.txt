How to move a folder containing aliases to another machine without breaking the aliases? <body> I've got a large folder of music with lots of aliases to tunes that are spread throughout subfolders of the main tunes folder. For example I might keep the original files sorted by artist, and then have a folder for a genre with a bunch of aliases to tunes (or folders of tunes) for that genre, like a playlist.  Now that I've got a new laptop how can I transfer the whole folder without breaking the aliases?  I tried using the symbolic link options of rsync but that doesn't seem to work with OS X aliases.  BTW I'm not interested in replacing the aliases with a copy of the original, I really want to keep the aliases :)  Is this something Time Machine can help with?  Thanks!  <answer13986> I believe aliases will be handled correctly if copied through the finder, even to external media.  If you are doing it through codersync/code you will probably have issues.  References:  ul liForum Posting/li liScript to possibly convert Aliases to Symlinks/li /ul  <answer13997> Aliases are not the same as symlinks.  Symlinks just point to a path (relative or absolute). Aliases first track the file's unique ID and then the path.  Since there are two pieces of information stored in an alias - they are more robust and will follow a file that's moved based on the unique ID.  Finder (or the very powerful codeditto/code) are your best bets for moving aliases intact. Worst case you could use disk utility to make an image of a folder that contains everything needed as a subfolder and then move that to preserve the relative locations of the files and isolate the effects of a short name change (/Users/whatever) in case you wish to change that. Once the original mac is disconnected from the new mac - the aliases will reconnect as desired to location of the files on the new mac.  <comment14943> Is there a reason you can't use a metadata-based system (e.g. iTunes playlists) for this kind of organization?  If someone told me they wanted to organize resources using symbolic links instead of metadata, I would warn them of the possibility of exactly the kind of situation you outlined here in your question. <comment14944> +1.  For Austin's comment.  Also - just copying the aliases over should be sufficient as long as the directory structure is the same, no? <comment14947> I use Ableton Live for DJing and it's really useful to have this kind of setup when digging through tunes finding something to play.. I could go in to detail about it but let's just say Live doesn't have a nice iTunes style metadata browser :) <comment14948> @Harv Hmmm maybe I'm breaking the aliases with the way I'm copying the folder to an external disk. I'll try again later with a direct copy.. <comment14949> @mash aaah okay.  Innnteresting.  Yeah, let us know how it works out. <comment15009> +1 to you all. I was of the opinion that Live did a pretty good job of integrating iTunes metadata (e.g. BPM field can be used to house key, and then key is available in Live). Is this not the case? Been a while since I used it and I may confusing it with Traktor or something similar. I believe @Harv is right though. The symlinks should still work as long as the directories are the same. Interested to find out. Good luck. <comment15010> Very interesting. Thanks. <comment15248> Thanks all, a direct copy worked fine, I had been breaking the aliases by backing up the folder with rsync. <comment15250> @boehj I don't know what data Live reads from iTunes, sounds interesting..
