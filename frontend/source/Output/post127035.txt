Can I give Automator apps a window? <body> Can I create a window / UI for applications created using Automator? Or is this just not possible with Automator apps?  Background: I created an "application" through Automator, and dragged the app into the Dock and it works fine. However the app does not act like an normal app. e.g. I can't seem to "open" a window for it, or have it in the CMD + Tab menu.   Note: this is a follow up question to: “drag n drop” application to convert images to base64 string for web development  h1SOLUTION/h1  As per answer below I used the emfree/em platypus. I simply created a new script through the UI and copy and pasted the code I'd used for my Automator app:  precodefor f in "$@" do     openssl base64 -in "$f" | pbcopy done /code/pre  Note: this copies the base64 string to clipboard, and thus I assume its only good for simple imgs (which is all I want it for)  <answer127100> Create the application with Platypus instead:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/z3YXt.png" alt=""  The application window looks like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hm1oo.png" alt=""  <comment148800> what UI window would that be? <comment148802> Anything really, I just want to be able to load up my app via spotlight - and then drag and drop files on it in the CMD + Tab menu. Sure I can have it in my dock, but...I don't really like the dock <comment148818> so just a drop box window, that stays open. <comment148846> Well, just a window so OSX treats the app like other normal apps. If its in the CMD+Tab menu (which I can drag files onto), or there is a drag / drop target, then I will be happy.
