Storage used by applications doesn't match between folder info and system report <body> I'm running on Macbook Pro OS X 10.11. I'm curious that when I check my storage the system reports I've used for apps 100.15GB whereas the applications folder size is just 39.56GB. Is it probably counted for storage that apps use to store their data?. If so how could I inspect those data (e.g. location and size) to consider removing them?   Thanks in advance.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EEjng.png" alt="storage info from applications folder"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PrU6X.png" alt="storage info from system report"  <answer235071> Not all applications are stored in /Applications. That's the default install folder for most applications, but it doesn't include all applications. In fact, since applications are really just bundles of files, most applications can be run from anywhere.   To demonstrate this, take a look in System Profiler at Software  Applications. You'll see lots of software that isn't in /Applications  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/s1gHe.png" alt="enter image description here"  With that said, using this as a method to eliminate large applications probably isn't the most efficient or easy. You'd be better off using a disk scanner like DaisyDisk, Disk Inventory X, or some other alternative.  <comment287471> Thank you for very fast response, I'll be checking those tools out.
