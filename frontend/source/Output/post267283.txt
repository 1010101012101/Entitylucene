How do I regain all unallocated disk space to add it to macOS after removing Linux partitions? <body> I originally came across this post with a possible answer but, I do not understand how to go about the process, especially when 2 drives are both not showing there full size. This originally happened when I had Ubuntu Gnome installed alongside OS X (one drive (SSD)).   I have dedicated the SSD to my OSes and the other HDD to my home folders.  When I attempted to delete the Linux partitons (one on each drive) they are now completely gone out of sight. I am unable to regain that space to add it to my system and home partiton on the drives.   Both are 500 GB drives but only 250 GB are used. I have a mid 2012 MacPro    (Incase your wondering how I have 2 drives in this mac I replaced my optical drive with a hard drive caddy)  When trying to read the gtp/pmbr scheme this is what it spits out disk0 is osx disk1 is home.  precode  zackerys-MacBook-Pro:~ gefiltefish1478$ sudo gpt show disk1 Password:       start       size  index  contents           0          1         PMBR           1          1         Pri GPT header           2         32         Pri GPT table          34          6                   40     409600      1  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B      409640  488050672      2  GPT part - 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC   488460312       2024            488462336     260096      3  GPT part - 0657FD6D-A4AB-43C4-84E5-0933C84B4F4F   488722432  487790592            976513024     260096      4  GPT part - 0657FD6D-A4AB-43C4-84E5-0933C84B4F4F   976773120         15            976773135         32         Sec GPT table   976773167          1         Sec GPT header zackerys-MacBook-Pro:~ gefiltefish1478$ sudo gpt show disk0        start        size  index  contents            0           1         PMBR            1           1         Pri GPT header            2          32         Pri GPT table           34           6                    40      409600      1  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B       409640   499902768      2  GPT part - 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC    500312408     1269536      3  GPT part - 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC    501581944   498372488             999954432      260096      4  GPT part - 0657FD6D-A4AB-43C4-84E5-0933C84B4F4F   1000214528         655            1000215183          32         Sec GPT table   1000215215           1         Sec GPT header /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/smIWO.jpg" alt="disk1"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1l4nm.jpg" alt="and both drives show somthing like this"  This is the output when I run codedf/code.  precodedf Filesystem                       512-blocks      Used Available Capacity iused      ifree %iused  Mounted on /dev/disk0s2                      499902768 130185800 369204968    27% 1249077 4293718202    0%   / devfs                                   375       375         0   100%     651          0  100%   /dev /dev/disk1s2                      488050672 465813600  22237072    96%   89020 4294878259    0%   /Volumes/HOME map -hosts                                0         0         0   100%       0          0  100%   /net map auto_home                             0         0         0   100%       0          0  100%   /home localhost:/KJdZJAu-3rlfljye4LGYtx 499902768 499902768         0   100%       0          0  100%   /Volumes/MobileBackups /dev/disk1s1                         403266        15    403251     1%       0          0  100%   /private/var/tmp/MP4XJX8Y   /code/pre  I'm extremely wary about rewriting any GPT without someone else's input.  Needing help; I know @klanomath was able to fix this issue hopefully he can have some input on my situation.  Possibly someone can make a bash command line to automate the process for other users who may encounter the issue.   Possible future GitHub project if I figure out how to do this on my own.  <answer267298> Your disk contains some blocking Linux swap partitions: disk1s3, disk1s4 and disk0s4 (all partitions with the type 0657FD6D-A4AB-43C4-84E5-0933C84B4F4F). Additionally your probable Recovery HD disk0s3 has the wrong type: it should be 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC.  Depending on your Mac model either use Internet Recovery Mode or a bootable OS X installer thumb drive to "repair" your disks.  hr  Since your user folder resides on a different partition create a emsafety net/em admin user first on your boot disk. Log-in as second admin user to be sure that the account works independently from your main admin user.  hr  ul liBoot to Internet Recovery Mode (or the thumb drive)/li liOpen Terminal in the menubar  Utilities/li liEnter codediskutil list/code to get an overview./li liUse the disk identifiers of your SSD and the HDD (e.g disk0 and disk1) enter codegpt -r show disk$/code.

That will help people understand your issue and try to suggest fixes. <comment335311> @fsb Yes, my apologies. I have edited it; in desperate need of help. <comment335315> What exactly are you asking? <comment335317> Disk0s3 has the wrong partition type: it should be 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC. Everything else looks ok. To regain empty and continuous space to expand your OS X partitions you simply have to delete disk1s3 and disk1s4 as well as disk0s4 (all Linux remnants). <comment335319> @klanomath Ive tried deleting the partitions (in osx and recovery) but i get "MediaKit reports partition (map) too small. If you recently grew your whole-disk, you should run whole-disk repair." On disk0 and "Couldnâ€™t read partition map." on disk1. Is there any other data I could post to help diagnose the issue. <comment335320> @klanomath Im thinking it would be possible to boot into gparted and deleting those partitions since I have an ISO on hand. <comment335321> @NEXTCODE4U Did you soft link the whole /Users folder to /Volumes/HOME (disk0s2) or single $user folders to /Volumes/HOME/Users/$user (or /Volumes/HOME/$user)? <comment335322> @NEXTCODE4U gparted is IMHO always a very bad idea! You can regain the space and change the Recovery HD's type in Internet Recovery Mode or with a bootable OS X installer thumb drive (depends on your Mac model)! <comment335324> @klanomath Its single; just my user folder. Ive had the home folder like this even before I installed ubuntu so i don't see how it could be part of the issue. BTW thanks for the input more than appreciate it. I'm desperate for my storage!!! <comment335328> @NEXTCODE4U there are several methods to "export" a user folder: 1. soft link to /Users/ or changing the $user folder to /Volumes/HOME/ with dscl (or with the Directory Tool) or in the system prefs  User & Groups. Do you still have a /Users folder in the root directory? I'm just asking for safety nets (e.g. if you have a second admin user at /Users/$adminuser2) Depending on that I'll propose a strategy how to resolve your problem. <comment335329> @klanomath I did it through system prefrences <comment335330> @NEXTCODE4U Also: Please add your Mac model to the question (e.g. MacBook Pro Early 2011 or MacBook late 2009) <comment335331> @klanomath YOU WERE RIGHT! I have a mid 2012 mac pro so it would only let me use the mountain lion recovery (witch wouldn't let me delete the partitions) I simply partitioned a section of my drive and wrote the sierra installer to it. (sorry didn't know i had a copy in my home folder) After deleting all linux partitions and my recovery partition I was able to reclaim my space. I see where I went wrong now, my bad. More than appreciate the input. I wouldn't of been able to figure it out without ya homie -hits my chest twice and throws peace sign-
