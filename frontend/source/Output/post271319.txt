Restoring Contacts groups from Time Machine <body> For reasons unknown, everything just completely vanished from my Contacts (including contacts and all of my groups).  Note, these are all Contacts that were stored emon my Mac/em -- I don't use iCloud and they are not synced anywhere else.  No problem -- I have a Time Machine backup, so I enter TM, scroll back in time to yesterday, and there they are.  I select all and restore all of my contacts.  Back in the present, all of my individual contacts are there.  emBut none of the groups are./em  I've just spent several hours fruitlessly trying to figure out how to restore my groups.  One thing that has emnot/em worked is copying the entire Application Support  AddressBook folder from my Time Machine to my user library:  when I try this, and then restart Contacts, the entire list is empty again.  (I don't understand this behavior at all, by the way.)     Where does Contacts store my group metadata?  How can I restore it from a Time Machine backup?   <answer271354> In Contacts, look at the View menu; you can hide groups, or show groups.  The data (at least, in El Capitan, 10.11.6) is in   "/Users/your_name_here/Library/Application Support/AddressBook"  When I delete a group, it changes the files "Metadata" and "AddressBook-v22.abcddb-wal"  <comment341143> You don't seem to have understood the question. The groups have been DELETED. And as I already said that restoring the entire Application/AddressBook directory didn't help, just telling me that they're somewhere in that folder is obviously not helpful. <comment341215> What is the evidence of deletion?   Could it be disappearance?  Change in the View menu explains disappearance. <comment341219> When you hide groups the sidebar disappears.  In this case the sidebar  is present, but empty:  it says "All Contacts" and there is nothing below it. <comment341238> Two files change when I delete a group (see edited answer above)
