Why do some items in my Finder window appear grayed out? <body> In my finder window some items are grayed out. Why is that?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AVzTP.png" alt="enter image description here"  I've taken more snapshots:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BIJ2H.png" alt="enter image description here"  Note: If I rename the file it is no longer grayed out.   Note 2: I noticed a intermediary file is being created that is immediately renamed:    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nmhJI.png" alt="enter image description here"  Note 3: I also noticed that the .DS_Store file is grayed out.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tv2RD.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer212843> The items you are seeing are invisible items. Names that start with a dot indicate the file should be hidden. If you changed finder to show hidden files, it will display them greyed out, but the files will work as normal. Besides having a name that starts with a dot, it is possible to set a special file attribute that will make finder hide the file.   If you want to turn the showing of hidden files back off, one option is to use the terminal, open it and use this command: codedefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles NO/code and then log out and back in.  <comment256983> If you get information on the file - does it appear locked? What happens when you duplicate the file? <comment256986> I'm able to make a duplicate easily. I've right clicked on it and selected get info and it's not locked. <comment256987> OK - that rules out a file lock/permission issue. Sadly, still lots of guesses to cover. http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/163939/ and http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/74624/ and http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/9681/ cover some causes. Also, if you have any system extensions, they can cause this if they hang processing a file (virus scanner, dropbox type syncing, etc...) <comment257022> Are the screen shots hidden though? When I rename them they are no longer grayed out. <comment257023> I think that may just be a rendering bug that happens when you turn on an unsupported feature, but that's mostly a guess. I had that happen in 10.5 years ago when I turned on invisible files. <comment257038> @JohnKeates I've had this bug to, and I don't have the show all files on. <comment322800> Check the extended properties. http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/258235/85301
