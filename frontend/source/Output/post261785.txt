How to drag window from anywhere on the window without using the title bar? <body> I have made my Terminal borderless, like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WCXnC.png" alt="Image of Terminal window"  So, how can I move the window from anywhere inside the window and not just the title bar?  <answer261791> To move any window, including borderless ones such as iTerm, you can move the mouse to any edge of the window until the cursor become a double-arrow, then click and hold while moving the mouse in a direction opposite of what would change the window size.  As an example, if you mouse over the top edge while the cursor is a double-arrow then click, hold and drag upwards or downwards it makes the window larger or smaller respectively, however if you drag left or right the window moves and once moving you can drag it anywhere and then release the mouse when you have the window where you want it.  The same paradigm applies on any edge of the window, moving the mouse to any edge, to where the cursor becomes a double-arrow then click and hold, and move in a direction that will not make the window larger or smaller will move the window instead.  <comment327821> How did you make Terminal borderless? <comment327822> @user3439894 I am using iTerm 3 which has an option to hide borders <comment360969> Wow. I suspect that's not what they had in mind when they designed that particular feature.  That said, good thinking.
