Generating a monochrome PDF file from a color PDF file <body> How can I generate a monochrome pdf file from a color pdf file?  I have tried ImageMagick's convert, but with bad results.  A direct conversion     convert -monochrome file.pdf file-bw.pdf   produces dithered images.  Going through png     convert -monochrome -background white -geometry 2048 file.pdf file-bw.png   stubbornly keeps the background to some shade of gray.  <answer51338> You can do this easily in Preview:  ol liOpen the PDF in Preview./li liGo to File  Export.../li liFrom the Quartz Filter drop-down box, select Black &amp; White./li liSave and you're done./li /ol  <answer54946> You can also use strongGhostscript/strong to transform color into grayscale PDFs. The most recent version is v. 9.05, which is the recommended one for this task.  Commandline:  precode gs \    -o grayscale.pdf \    -sDEVICE=pdfwrite \    -dPDFSETTINGS=/prepress \    -sColorConversionStrategy=Gray \    -sColorConversionStrategyForImages=Gray \    -sProcessColorModel=DeviceGray \    -dCompatibilityLevel=1.4 \    /path/to/input.pdf /code/pre
