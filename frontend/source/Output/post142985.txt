It often suggests some solutions.  It looks like you haven't tried that yet, so if you get into trouble, start there.  You can also consult the Homebrew web page, the Homebrew wiki, and the Homebrew troubleshooting page.  If you consult those resources, you'll find suggestions to run codebrew doctor/code and to set the permissions on code/usr/local/code... as well as other suggestions.  So, please try those first, if you get into trouble again in the future.  <comment168435> Please try and explain your problem.
