What is the /data/db folder in OS X? <body> I'm using OS X 10.6.8 and cleaning up my almost full hard-drive using the free tool Disk Inventory X. I stumbled upon the /data/db folder which weighs more than 600Mb. Before deleting some of its content I'd like to understand: what is it? Is it system critical? Note that I'm a web developer and I often create databases on my computer. It seems that the name of the files matches some of the databases I previously created, but not sure it's a 100% match.  <answer64684> On my snow leopard system there is no such directory. I guess custom installed.  do a  precode&gt; sudo -s  &gt; ls -alR /data/db ls: /data/db: No such file or directory /code/pre  <answer65601> It was custom installed by MongoDB, this the default folder for writing database. So it has nothing to do with OSX.  <comment77146> Yes, custom installed by MongoDB.
