How can I reenable admin privileges without an administrative user? <body> I installed server and fiddling around settings and I unchecked administer this account and the server crashed immediately.  Now I am listed as standard user and cannot perform any changes:  precode$ dscl . -read /groups/admin GroupMembership GroupMembership: root /code/pre  I thought there will be atleast 1 user to administer the whole computer excluding root :(. How can I get back. Quite panicked as I might loose everything.  <answer58860> You can try whether codesudo -s/code still works (which would allow you to add yourself to the admin group again), but probably it won't.  Do the following  ul liReboot into Single User mode by keeping kbdCmd-S/kbd pressed during reboot/li licode/sbin/mount -uw //code/li licoderm /var/db/.AppleSetupDone/code/li licodereboot/code/li /ul  This will trick your Mac into behaving like a new installation (but with your data still intact). Follow the setup without migrating any data etc., near the end you will have the option to create a new user with admin privileges. Make sure to pick a new username here to avoid any conflicts.  <comment67775> Why not Single User Mode in first place? <comment67776> That will probably work as well. The idea is not to recover the system afterwards but just to create a new admin user. <comment67777> sudo -s says this : Gamer is not in the sudoers file.  This incident will be reported. <comment67778> I will try CMD-R now what should I do once I enter recovery mode? <comment67779> So once I enter recover mode I create a new admin account correct? <comment67780> I will try that and brb Thanks for quick replies :) . I will report back in few moments <comment67782> It says performing Internet recovery this may take a while <comment67783> Are you sure it won't perform restoration? As in delete all data <comment67785> Actually it should prompt you first <comment67786> I am on recovery screen now I only have 4 options <comment67787> Restore from time machine , reinstall OSX , get help online , disk utility. Where can I add new account or modify existing one . Thanks <comment67795> Err, I remember an option to add new users?! Grr, hang on. <comment67798> Should I try going into single user mode? <comment67799> and perform changes as suggested here : http://www.hackmac.org/tutorials/how-to-create-a-new-administrator-account/ <comment67802> rather http://www.thegeekplace.co.uk/2011/11/15/my-admin-rights-have-disappeared/ <comment67803> but the hackmac article looks good as well <comment67804> Thank you so much for sticking with me and helping . I will do what you suggested by going to that link. I will post back in a bit <comment67817> Could you two take this into a [chat room](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/4345/discussion-between-patrix-and-gamer)? <comment67824> Gamer can't, not enough reputation <comment67854> Hello solved the issue :-) all working now thanks once again <comment67863> Is "rm rm" a mistake? <comment67864> And besides .applesetupdone is actually called .AppleSetupDone . This WILL be a problems on case sensitive volumes <comment67868> Thanks for the inputs Max. Changes are made now :-)
