I've manually copied files from my time machine backup drive and now I cannot delete them from my computer <body> I got a new computer and I didn't want to do a full time machine restore but rather pick and choose what files I was going to copy off of my time machine drive.  So, I went into the directory, found some files I want, and did codecp -Rpv dir /Users/username/dir/code  However, With the code-P/code it kept the same permissions as the files on the time machine. codechmod -R 777 dir/code doesn't work and neither does resetting permissions from within the 'get info' - 'sharing and permissions' setting.  How can I get the permissions for the directory back to something that will allow me to delete the directory?  <answer283241> I've sorted it out. First, you need to look at the ACLs that got copied along with the files.  precodels -le /path/to/dir /code/pre  Once you've done that you can see that everything had this:  precode0: group:everyone deny write,delete,append,writeattr,writeextattr,chown /code/pre  So, what I did was add a new ACL policy to the directory by doing this:   precodechmod -R +a "admin allow read,readattr,readextattr,readsecurity" dir  /code/pre  Followed by:  precodesudo rm -rf dir /code/pre  <comment357110> Welcome to Ask Different!
