Network sharing using AFP command line: mount_afp: AFPMountURL returned error 2, errno is 2 <body> I have a server with some directories exported for AFP.  I can mount afp volumes from Finder without any problem.  When I try this from the command line:  precode$ sudo mount_afp  'afp://me:mypass@my-server/home/me'  /Users/me/myMountPoint /code/pre  I get the error  codemount_afp: AFPMountURL returned error 2, errno is 2/code  As stated, I can mount my-server's code/home/me/code using Finder and my credentials on that machine just fine.   Also tried with codemount_afp -i .../code interactive mode with no luck.  apparently, error 2 is:  precodeerror 2 siInitVBLQsErr: VBLqueues for all slots could not be initialized. or dsAddressErr: address error /code/pre  Which doesn't help much  <answer271993> Turns out code/home/me/code wasn't the share name on my-server - just the local path.   It is actually "me's home".  I went in to the server and changed that behavior in /etc/afp.conf
