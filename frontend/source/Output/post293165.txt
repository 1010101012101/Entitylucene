Install El Capitan from Recovery Mode in Terminal <body> While doing clean installation I formatted my iMac's hard disk and now I can't boot using USB bootable which having El Capitan, but I can go to recovery -10.11.4 disk and can see USB drive mounted. Now I want to Install OS X El Capitan.app in Recovery Mode and I want to execute it somehow to start the installation from the terminal. I don't want to connect to the internet.  How can I finally install El Capitan from Recovery Mode, within the terminal?
