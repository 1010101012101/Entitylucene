Is there an alternative App to Mail on iPad? <body> I'm looking for another app than Mail on my iPad. I have searched the appStore without success.  Is there not other emailers on iPad ?  <answer23186> A solution would be to use strongGmail web app/strong and add it to the dashboard.  The iPad web interface is pretty nice, I believe it works offline, too. One of the main problem is that there's no new mail notification.  <answer23200> If you are using Gmail then have a look at:  ol liInbox2/li liMailing Desk/li /ol  Inbox2 even lets you integrate your conversations from other webapps (twitter, facebook, linkdin), if that is something relevant for you.  <comment25864> What exactly are you looking for in this Mail alternative? <comment25866> It's in fact I don't want to merge my emails and the one of my wife in the same App. I will use the other one, leaving Mail for her. It's an idea to get along with the fact that there is no "session" on the iPad. <comment95167> The Inbox2 URL says it is for Windows, and the Mailing Desk link is giving a 404 error.
