Do not let the viewer go to the first page systematically <body> I edit tex files with codeEmacs/code under codeMac OS X 10.10.1/code, compile tex pdf and view it with codePreview/code.  The problem is that each time the code is modified and re-compiled, the viewer systematically goes to the first page of the pdf. Ideally, I want to stay in the same page as before, where is probably the modification.  Does anyone know how to achieve this? Will changing to another viewer do the trick?  PS: I used to do this under Ubuntu with codeevince/code and codeokular/code, that worked fine.  <answer212361> In Preview there is only a setting that let it start on the page that it was last used, but that is not necessarily the page with the modification made by emacs.  <comment256422> I did tick the setting `Start on the last viewed page`, it did not help. Apparently, each time the pdf is re-generated, this information is lost... <comment256470> That may be due to the OS X version? Which OS X are you using?
