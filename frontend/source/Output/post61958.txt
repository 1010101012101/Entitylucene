GMail and Outlook Attachment Not Showing in Mail after Upgrading to Mountain Lion <body> I used to see Word and PDF attachements with my GMail account in Mail.  Recently I added my new Outlook account to Mail and found that attachments are missing.  So I asked my friends to send attachments to my GMail account and they are also not showing up.  All I see in attachment is a winmail.dat file (no matter my friend sends a Word or PDF file over).  This happens only after I upgraded to Mountain Lion.  Just wonder if there's some setting I need to tweak, hopefully this is not a 10.8 problem.  Thanks for any help.  <answer95273> There is a free online winmail.dat reader at Winmail.dat. The usual warnings about uploading documents to an unknown website apply, so don't use this for confidential stuff.
