Problems changing drive icon <body> Want to change the icon of my main drive.  I have a bunch of drive icons from interfacelift.  They appear to be just .icns packed in the resource fork  (%file  returns empty, and %cat  prints nothing, which is fine, I understand why).  My understanding is the way to use these was:    ol liopen the icon file info (cmd-i)  liselect the icon in the upper left, copy it (cmd-c)  liselect the drive you want to change pull up info (cmd-i)  lipaste icon on top of icon on drive /ol  Makes sense to me.  Doesn't work.  Checked from shell, .VolumeIcon.icns doesn't exist on the drive.  Any thoughts?  I feel dumb, I've done this before, can't make it work now.  (10.6.6)  <answer9625> Did you click on the icon to select it before pasting?  I found I needed to do that or it would ignore my paste.  <answer9627> Check to make sure you downloaded the correct version. I just went to interfacelift.com, selected an icon set, chose Mac OS X download. The icon set downloaded and unpacked as folder with the icons as folders. I then followed the same steps you listed above and changed the icon of one of my drives.  Before  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tugS5.png" alt="Before"  After  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Eugko.png" alt="enter image description here"  If you can see the Info window in the 2nd picture (the After), the icon at the top of that window is highlighted with a slight blueish border. That's what it looks like when it is selected.  Hope this helps.  <answer9628> emsigh/em figured it out.  Should have tried this first.  I needed to give myself write permissions to the drives.  Just added my account as read-write to the drive itself from the info pane.  Everything worked after that.  <answer9744> For anyone coming to this page for help with changing the icons of applications, it might be helpful to know that a similar solution is needed.    Select the Application you wish to change the icon of, press cmd i, and look at the bottom of the window.  Change "everyone" to read/write and then proceed to drag and drop your icon on the applications icon within the info pane. Don't forget to change the permissions back to read only for "everyone" when you're finished.  <answer113272> I have found that OSX 10.6 default permissions can cause the problem in third party applications. There is generally not a problem changing Apple icons, because they require your password. To edit the permissions:  ol liFind your application in finder in the Application folder./li liRight click - Get Info, or select the application and press codecmd + i/code./li liEdit the application permission by clicking the lock in the bottom right corder, see picture of bottom of the Get Info panel./li liChange the permissions for everyone to Read &amp; Write./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/R4DTZ.png" alt="enter image description here"  Now you can drag the code.icns/code icon image you like over the icon in the top left corner of the Get Info panel.   <comment10066> Yup. Was highlighted blue. <comment10067> Ha! I was just about to ask that. I updated all my icons with new ones but I was unable to update the Time Machine drive icon because of a lack of permissions. Glad you figured it out.
