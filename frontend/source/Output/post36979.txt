How do I insert a function along with a word in numbers <body> I am using numbers and I have a column function at the footer row. I'd like it to produce a Countif() along with a word.  I tried: code=Countif(Checkboxes,True) "Checkboxes"/code so that it would express for example code5 Checkboxes/code  That did not work as expected.  <answer36990> You can do this in the custom cell format rather than the function.  ol liGo to the cell click formatmanage custom cell formats/li liFrom the Type pop-up menu, choose Number &amp; Text/li liDrag the (blue) Entered Text element from the Date &amp; Time Elements box into the empty format field above the box./li liPlace the insertion point after the element, and then type your text 'checkboxes'/li liClick Ok to save./li /ol
