Adding New Dictionary <body> I am following the instructions at the bottom of this article article to add the Webster's dictionary to my dictionary.app list. It does not seem to be working (the new dictionary does not show up in the dictionary.app preferences pane.  I think the problem might be because I am on Mavericks but the dictunifier app is from 2011. Does anyone know of a workable way? The dictionary tar.bz file contains files with the extension .dict.dz, .idx, and .ifo.  <comment157750> I am also running Mavericks and was able to add the dictionary.
