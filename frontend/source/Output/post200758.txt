"iPad is disabled, connect to iTunes" <body> Trying to turn on my kids' iPad which has been off for a few months.  Tried several of my 'usual' passcodes, but iPad became 'disabled' before I could try them all.  Now it's "iPad is disabled, connect to iTunes"  Connecting to iTunes via hold-home-and-plug-in-USB pops up iTunes with "Restore" or "Update".  Do NOT want to lose all data, there are probably photos on there that are not backed up.  Is there ANYTHING I can do?  I'm not even sure which version of iOS is on there, but it's 8.something...  If I could just get a few more attempts to enter PIN, I would figure it out eventually.  Can I jailbreak it in this condition? Somehow pull the data before Restoring/Updating?  HELP!  <answer200765> I heard that Jailbreaking it may work, it's probably your only option to salvage the data on the iPad. Normally, I would strongnever/strong even suggest Jailbreaking, but in this case, it's probably your only option. I've never done it and have no interest whatsoever in Jailbreaking, so I can't tell how to do it, what to use, or even if it will for sure work, but it's worth a try.  <comment241985> If a person wanted to jailbreak a locked ipad (which I obviously don't) and that person didn't know which ios version was on the ipad, how would they proceed? Is there a jailbreak for all 8.x ? <comment241987> If you were to just connect it to iTunes, not restoring it, I think that it would tell you the version of iOS it's running. Could be wrong, though. <comment241990> I tried that, but all itunes says is "to allow access, please respond on ipad", and the ipad just says "connect to itunes". <comment241991> You might make that a separate question on Ask Different. I have no idea.
