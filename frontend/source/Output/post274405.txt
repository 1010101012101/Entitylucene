Reverse Accidental Activation of Find My iPhone on iPad <body> My elderly 83 yr. old neighbour has asked for help getting into her iPad.  Seems she accidentally may have put on "Find My iPhone", she has an eyesight problem. She does not have an iPhone, but I have to presume she did something like this? We have her username and password, and a list of her personal questions to answer if needed! When we open the system she puts in her 4 digit number to unlock the iPad. Next we are asked for User ID and Password. I have the original Apple ones put in at set up. Next, a screen tells us about "Administrative Options", however I can go no further.  I do not know what was involved in the accidental activation.  Any advice?  Angie  <comment345011> Findmyiphone is also useful with iPads as an Activation Lock preventing a stolen iPad from being cleared and re-used after being stolen. Don't be confused because it's called findmyiphone.  If you can log into http://www.apple.com/find with her credentials from a regular computer and browser, you can turn it off there by removing the iPad from her account.  That doesn't need to be done however unless she is selling the iPad. <comment345063> Could you post a screenshot of the page you got stuck on?
