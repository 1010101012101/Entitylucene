iPhone restarts whenever a call is made <body> I updated my iPhone yesterday and now whenever I take or make a call my phone restarts itself.  It was updated via iTunes on my computer. Each phone call can last between 1 - 10 minutes. I've never had this problem before.  <answer13266> Sounds like either a bug or the update didn't work properly.    That said, you should re-apply the update using these instructions from Apple support.  <comment70853> What version of iOS are you running? What version sis you update from? What model of iPhone do you have?
