How to capture audio with Quicktime Screen Recording <body> I need to create a bunch of screencasts for my work.  I was going to use Quicktime to do this but when I choose "New Screen Recording" to do this, the audio is never captured.    How can Quicktime be made more useful for screencasts?  Update:  Here are some suggested methods that have been proposed in various forums that simply are not viable:  ul liUsing a male to male audio cable and connecting the speaker jack to the microphone jack.  This might work on Windows, but Macs only have a single audio jack, ruling this method out./li /ul  <answer251873> Sadly, after much research, the answer to this question is: "Can't be done."  At least not with Quicktime alone.  Quicktime is purposefully crippled and you will never be able to record audio using just it.    The best work around that I have found is to download Jing.  The free version if your screen casts only need to be five minutes long or less, or the paid version if you need longer screencasts.  I hope that someday Apple will grow a pair and uncripple their software, but until then Quicktime is not a viable self-contained solution for screencasts that include audio.  <answer251879> You could use Audio Hijack (per Tetsujin) to capture the audio as needed or you could use a USB audio adapter to do it for significantly less.  I use the Behringer UCA202 Audio Interface with my iMac.    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FAZZz.png" alt="enter image description here"  When I needed to record a screencast emwith/em the audio from the application, I just used an RCA audio cable I had laying in a drawer similar to the image below.  You don't need anything fancy or expensive, just a standard RCA audio cable.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9XP4hm.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  In quicktime, I just selected the USB device as my input:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/R1FKS.png" alt="enter image description here"  Now, when I say emsignificantly less/em, Audio Hijack is about $50 if buying the new license.  The USB Audio device is $30 and if you have to buy an RCA audio cable, you're looking at another $5.  So, for $35,  you get an audio interface that has many more uses than the software can provide (for example, I can hook my Bose Wave Radio to my iMac now) whereas the software doesn't allow you to do that.  Make no mistake, Audio Hijack is good software.  This is just another, albeit less expensive, avenue to solve your problem.  <comment291054> Possible duplicate of [QuickTime Screen + Audio Capture](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/60085/quicktime-screen-audio-capture) <comment291060> Seems to be more of a handling problem here (while the linked question asks about the general feasibility and has two, let's say, rather unhelpful answers). <comment291173> The proper go-to app for this is Rogue Amoeba's Audio Hijack.
