MacBook Pro 13 resolution problem? <body> I just bought a MacBook Pro 13. whenever I play a game that has lower resolution than 1280-800 I get two big black rectangles on both side of the screen, instead of the screen entirely filled.  Is there any solution for this problem?  <answer16783> This happens because the game is not widescreen enabled (but 4:3). This usually happens with ports of old games, from the times, when 4:3 (or close to 4:3) resolutions were common em(like 640x480, 800x600, 1024x768, 1280x1024)/em. Look for resolution settings in the game and change it to something closer to 16:10 and the black bars will be smaller.  <comment18338> thanks @mspasov but in game only three options are there 640x480, 800x600 and 1024x768 <comment18350> Then I don't think that there is a way to make it run widescreen on your monitor (16:10). However if you connect an external 4:3 monitor the game will run on "full screen".
