Is there an app to chat on Facebook on iOS? <body> Is there an app to chat on Facebook on iOS ?  I would like to be laptop free  <answer29819> There are two, both from Facebook. It's available in the Messages section of Facebook app, as well as the standalone Facebook Messenger app. The standalone app uses a denser interface, and would be an improvement if you were going to use this heavily, but the section of the complete app isn't much worse.  <answer29823> Also you can use IM+ it's a free app. And if you like to spending some money you can use IM+ Pro.  <comment34207> I see, however both don't show who is currently online... <comment34208> @Patrick: They haven't always worked for me in the past, but since I updated to iOS 4 I've got reliable push notifications for messages from Messenger. The Facebook app gives me some push notifications, but I'm not sure which; it's probably based on some settings. <comment34209> Push notifications work but they ignore mine and friends online status <comment105623> As of iOS 6 push notifications don't work right in the Facebook app.  See this question for details:http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/89947/27661
