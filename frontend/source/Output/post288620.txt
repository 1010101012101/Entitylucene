How do I align my TOC so the chapter names are on the right <body> When I create an automatic TOC in my word document, the chapter names appear on the right and the page numbers on the left. I want it the other way around.   <comment364478> I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because it is not about Apple hardware or software. <comment364480> Check out help function in Word and this is not an Apple issue. <comment364486> @Mark & SolarMike unless the OP is using Word for Mac (but he/she should indicate so; also, which version and a screenshot would be nice as well).
