Shortcuts to label files in Finder <body>    Are there any shortcuts to label a file in Finder?   The fastest way i know is strongto place an icon in the menubar/strong, but it would be much better when i can do it with the keyboard.  <answer55070> You could make your owns, creating an emApplication/em with strongAutomator/strong and then assigning a strongShortcut/strong to it.  To create the emAplication/em just:  ol liGo to strong/Aplications/Automator/strong and create a new strongWork Flow/strong./li liSelect strongGet Selected Finder Items/strong./li liThen select strongLabel Finder Items/strong, and choose the color you want to label with./li liSave as emAplication/em./li /ol  Now, you could assign a shortcut to it with an application such as QuickSilver, for instance.  You could, too, create a strongService/strong in strongAutomator/strong, which, as Daniel points out, can get a shortcut assigned directly. This post, shows you how.  <answer55114> I had assigned shortcuts to scripts like this in FastScripts, but I stopped using them because getting the selection does not work reliably in 10.7 or 10.8.  precodetry     tell application "Finder"         repeat with f in items of (get selection as alias list)             try                 set label index of f to item 1 of {2, 1, 3, 6, 4, 5, 7}             end try         end repeat     end tell end try /code/pre  <comment63182> Or you could create a **Service** in Automator, which can then be assigned a shortcut directly. <comment63184> @DanielLawson Indeed. Thats covered in the post I link to. Perhaps I should have made that clearer. <comment100563> I tried this method but it only labels the color red, how can you cycle through the other labels ? <comment100570> You have to save different scripts for each color (1 is orange, 3 is yellow, 0 is none). But they aren't really usable until Apple fixes that bug. <comment100577> What is the bug exactly ? <comment100587> If you open a new Finder window and select some files, `tell app "Finder" to selection` refers to the second frontmost window (or desktop). It doesn't happen if you move focus to some other application and back first.
