How to get pass a forgotten iPhone passcode? <body> I forgot my iPhone 5 passcode when I was changing the code. A window appeared on the device screen saying that iPhone is disabled.  I have Apple ID and password for it. After signing in to iCloud I have erased the device in order to remove the passcode from my iPhone but it still says that device will be erased when device will connect to internet. What would i have to do?  <answer173314> Connect the device to iTunes over USB and restore it. Once the restore process is complete, you can restore the backup.
