change Caps Lock key to fn key <body> I replaced standard kbdfn/kbd key by left kbdcontrol/kbd, left kbdcontrol/kbd by another useful key.   And as far as I don't use kbdCaps Lock/kbd key in everyday life, I decided to replace kbdCaps Lock/kbd key by kbdfn/kbd.   I use for this purpose PCKeyboardHack.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wbKXa.png" alt="change Caps Lock to fn key in PCKeyboardHack"  I just inputed number code63/code (which corresponds to kbdfn/kbd) in codeChange Caps Lock/code row.  But now my kbdCaps Lock/kbd don't do nothing: neither codeCapsLock/codeing nor kbdfn/kbd key work.  When I change kbdCaps Lock/kbd key by codeforward delete/code for example (117 code) - it is ok. And kbdCaps Lock/kbd starts work as codeforward delete/code key.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6bT2Y.png" alt="change Caps Lock to forward delete in PCKeyboardHack"  But I need to set kbdfn/kbd to kbdCaps Lock/kbd key.  strongUPDATE/strong  I have noticed in KeyRemap4MacBook EventViewer: when I press kbdCaps Lock/kbd...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DfXYA.png" alt="KeyRemap4MacBook EventViewer"  ... I get codecontrol_l/code keycode. But in fact it don't work even as codecontrol_l/code (I checked).   Why it shows codecontrol_l/code? Maybe because I have changed kbdfn/kbd key to left kbdcontrol/kbd in codeKeyRemap4MacBook/code app.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Qv3Ph.png" alt="fn to control_l in KeyRemap4MacBook"  When I uncheck this checkbox and watch in codeEventViewer/code on kbdCaps Lock/kbd clicking again: I see codeFn/code code on output.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oObDB.png" alt="fn logged in eventViewer but in fact not working"  But in fact it does not work as kbdFn/kbd (I check it on kbdfn/kbd+kbddelete/kbd)  strongUpdate 2/strong  I disabled kbdCAPS LOCK/kbd  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/q3Wq2.png" alt="CAPS LOCK - no action"  In PCKeyboardHack set kbdF19/kbd to kbdCaps Lock/kbd  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sJLUO.png" alt="F19 to Caps LOCK"  In codeKeyRemap4MacBook/code remap kbdF19/kbd to kbdfn/kbd  precode&lt;item&gt;     &lt;name&gt;f19_to_fn&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;identifier&gt;f19_to_fn&lt;/identifier&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::F19, KeyCode::FN&lt;/autogen&gt; &lt;/item&gt; /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/l5Wev.png" alt="enable f19 to fn in PCKeyboardHack"  And now kbdCaps Lock/kbd works as kbdfn/kbd except f1 - f12 keys. For example when I press default kbdfn/kbd + kbdf11/kbd I see Launchpad. When I press remapped kbdfn/kbd +  kbdf11/kbd I see volume down. So kbdf11/kbd not working with remapped kbdfn/kbd.   In other combinations like kbdfn/kbd + kbddelete/kbd = codeforward delete/code remapped kbdfn/kbd works well.  <answer115410> Brett Terpstra covered this in a December 2012 article about remapping the caps lock key.  http://brettterpstra.com/2012/12/08/a-useful-caps-lock-key/  <answer115418> Just changing caps lock to key code 63 with PCKeyboardHack works for me. Have you tried setting caps lock no action from System Preferences?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qFlE3.png" alt=""  You could also try to use PCKeyboardHack to for example change caps lock to F19 and then use a private.xml like this with KeyRemap4MacBook:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;   &lt;item&gt;     &lt;name&gt;test&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;identifier&gt;test&lt;/identifier&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::F19, KeyCode::FN&lt;/autogen&gt;   &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  <comment134507> Are you pressing an actual function key (F1-F19) with the function key (FN)? normally for it to work you need to press `FN + F1-19`. <comment134517> yes I test fn key with `forward delete`. I press `fn` + `delete`. When I have standard `fn` key I can forward delete and when I set `caps lock` to `fn` key, I cannot forward delete pressing `caps lock + backspace` <comment135106> Thank you! Caps Lock to fn works  except f1 - f12 keys (Please see update 2)
