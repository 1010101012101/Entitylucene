Internal and External microphone isn't working <body> There is a problem with the microphone on my MacBook (Yosemite 10.10.3)  The internal speakers work OK, and if I plug in headphones, they will work too. Unfortunately, the internal microphone doesn't work. When I plugged in an external microphone, it would't work either.  Does anyone have any ideas what could it be?  <answer187859> I use a MacBook Pro, but I've noticed this behaviour with some software, where the audio gain in System Preferences gets reduced to zero (i.e., no mic input). I suggest the following procedure:  ol liLaunch the software that you're having difficuty with./li liGo strongSystem Preferences/strong  strongSound/strong  strongInput/strong/li liIncrease the strongInput volume/strong slider as desired/li liSwitch back to your software application, without closing the strongSystem Preferences/strong dialog./li /ol  For some reason, if you close strongSystem Preferences/strong, then this can cause the software to reassert zero gain.  You might also want to consider resetting the system, just to ensure that you're resetting anything that might be inadvertently causing your issue.
