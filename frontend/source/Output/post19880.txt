Is it possible to automate FTP in Terminal? <body> I want to add an FTP command to my crontab to automatically download a file. How do I do this?  <answer19881> The easier way to do this is with wget. For example:  precodeIan-Cs-MacBook-Pro:ianc ian$ wget ftp://gnjilux.cc.fer.hr/welcome.msg --2011-08-02 19:48:00--  ftp://gnjilux.cc.fer.hr/welcome.msg            =&gt; `welcome.msg' Resolving gnjilux.cc.fer.hr... 161.53.74.67 Connecting to gnjilux.cc.fer.hr|161.53.74.67|:21... connected.

And a strong--quiet/strong mode so it's codecron/code-friendly and doesn't fill up your local inbox without messages for successful downloads.  <answer19882> The BASH script below will work  precode#!/bin/bash  remotefile="/path/to/ftp/server/file.png" hostname="ftp.server.net" username="ftpuser" password="ftppass" ftp -in $hostname&lt;&lt;EOF quote USER $username quote PASS $password  binary get $remotefile $HOME/temp/file.png quit EOF /code/pre  <answer19910> You may use curl which is available under Mac OSX already and can (for non-anonymous ftp) use logins stored in .netrc (so the password doesn't show up in a ps listing)  Plain vanilla anonymous ftp  precodecurl ftp://your.server.name/path/to/file.tar.gz &gt; ~you/Downloads/file.tar.gz /code/pre  Using .netrc  precodecurl --netrc ftp://your.server.name/path/to/file.tar.gz &gt; ~you/Downloads/file.tar.gz /code/pre  Specify user/password directly (visible in ps afterwards)  precodecurl --user "user:password" ftp://your.server.name/path/to/file.tar.gz &gt; ~you/Downloads/file.tar.gz /code/pre  <comment21930> Welcome to Unix wonders in Mac :) <comment21972> you can use launchd instead of cron as it's the official apple supported scheduler now. Cron still works, but launchd is the way of the future :D <comment21973> I used wget all last school year to download notes from my professor automatically just like this. Saved me from not having notes quite a few times since I never had to remember to get them. <comment21987> When did that change?
