Not able to sign in to iMessages on MacOS Sierra 10.12.5 <body> Not able to sign in to iMessages on MacOS Sierra 10.12.5. I enter the correct credentials and nothing happens, I can't sign in. I don't really want to try anything rather than to enter correct credentials, so please, refrain from suggestions like "restart your computer or similar". Thanks for your consideration, because I paid properly for my mac, and I expect for this to work and not have to take it to a computer repair shop just to have messages enabled.
