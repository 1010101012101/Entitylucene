Change file kind / kMDItemContentType <body> I have two text files with no extension and made them executable. Both are set to open with Terminal app. However one file is shown as kind "Text" and the other one as "executeable unix file".  if I display the metadata attributes with      mdls &lt; filename    I can see the the Content Type is different:  file 1 shows:  precode... kMDItemContentType                  = "public.unix-executable" ... /code/pre  file 2 shows:  precode... kMDItemContentType                  = "com.apple.traditional-mac-plain-text"  ... /code/pre  How can I set the kMDItemContentType of file 2 also to "public.unix-executable"? Is there a command line to to change it?  <answer134731> Explicitly set it within the file itself.   Right click (or kbdoption/kbd + click) the file  Open With  Other...  TextEdit.   Alternatively, you can use a text editor such as nano or vi within Terminal.   Set the attribute below the shebang line  precode#! /bin/bash  kMDItemContentType = "public.unix-executable"   #Rest of your shell script /code/pre  I just tested this on a script in my bin:  precodenjboot$ mdls /Users/njboot/bin/jpgrm  kMDItemContentCreationDate     = 2014-06-10 06:06:53 +0000 kMDItemContentModificationDate = 2014-06-11 19:58:23 +0000 kMDItemContentType             = "public.unix-executable" kMDItemContentTypeTree         = (     "public.unix-executable",     "public.data",     "public.item",     "public.executable" ) /code/pre  <comment159840> How can I edit meta attributes with nano or text edit? If I open the file I only see the file content, not the attributes ... where is the trick? <comment159919> @markus what type of file is this? i literally meant add it as text within the file under the presumption that it's an executable shell script. don't use nano. just use textedit. remove the executable property before opening it `chmod -x /path/to/file` then within the file itself add as text in a newline (below the shebang `#! /bin/whatever`) `kMDItemContentType = "public.unix-executable"` ...once done, save changes and make it executable again `chmod +x /path/to/file` <comment160451> It is a small shell script to connect to a server via ssh, but is has no extension. Just adding #! /bin/bash changed the kMDItemContentType after saving. <comment160454> The funny thing is that even if I open the file again and remove "#! /bin/bash", the kMDItemContentType keeps "public.unix-executable" in the metadata attributes.
