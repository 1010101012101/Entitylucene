Hacked, possibly - has anyone seen this message before? <body> This afternoon, the touch screen of my phone became unresponsive. I tried to restart the phone but it would not. So I went on and deleted find my iphone profile because it stopped the phone from restarting. As soon that was done, my phone restarted itself. Then I saw the following message on my phone:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YUOwQ.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Has anyone had this problem before. What's the cause of it?  P.S. I have since reset my phone and changed my iCloud password just in case.  <answer210366> From the picture it looks like someone placed your device in lost mode. When a device is placed in lost mode you have the option to display a message and a phone number on the lock screen.   When you erased the device and signed back in with your Apple ID this would turn off lost mode for the device.   <comment253887> No one else has my iCloud access and that isn't my phone number. Does this happen often do you know by any chance? <comment253888> I wouldn't have any idea how often it happens to people. When you place a device in lost mode you can have it display any phone number you want. Is your device jail broken? Installed any sketchy apps via third party stores? <comment253889> Nope, not jail break + all legitimate apps downloaded from the official app store. <comment253890> What do you mean "deleted find my iPhone profile"? <comment253895> Log on to iCloud, choose 'Find My iPhone', then click on the device, click 'Erase iPhone'. <comment253929> What happens when you call the number? <comment254007> Why don't you find it out ;) ... I don't think it's a valid number - it's too short.
