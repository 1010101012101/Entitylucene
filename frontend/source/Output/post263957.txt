USB Drive was not recognized by Windows. Windows created GPT partition setup <body> This USB disk was code/dev/disk1/code but now after Windows touched it I see code/dev/disk1/code and code/dev/disk1s1/code. How can I fix it so I can mount the drive correctly to access information?  This is what I believe is an HFS disk as I was previously able to mount it in Single User Mode using codemount -t hfs/code
