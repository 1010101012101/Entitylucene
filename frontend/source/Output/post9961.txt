How do I resize OS X main partition when I already have other BootCamp partitions? <body> Short story: partition resizing using strongDisk Utility/strong fails because strongMediaKit reports no such partition/strong when I try to shrink it. I also tried the same while booting from the DVD, same result.  Details:  ul lireFIT is installed and partition tables are in sync./li /ul  Current configuration:  ul lirefit/li lihfs+ - with OS X 10.6 on it/li lilinux swap/li lilinux ext4 - with Ubuntu on it/li /ul  I can boot both, OS X and Ubuntu, via rEFIt boot menu but strongI want to shrink the OSX partition in order to add another NTFS partion where I want to install Windows 7 x64/strong.  What should I do? img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WYGxZ.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer9978> Here is my current solution:  ul liboot from OS X DVD - mandatory!/li liopen terminal/li licodediskutil list/code/li licodeumount "/Volumes/Macintosh HD"/code/li licodefsck -f /dev/disk0s2/code/li licodediskutil resizevolume /dev/disk0s2 100G/code/li /ul  <answer13826> Easy method: iPartition ($45)  It gives you the option in the program to create a bootable DVD if you want to make changes to your boot drive.  You could also run it from another Mac with the Mac you want to modify booted into Target Disk Mode.  Definitely not free, but it will save you a headache.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vOGGF.jpg" alt="iPartition"
