How does Calendar automatically create an event after receiving an email with an appointment <body> There are times when I receive an email from various companies (or even airline tickets) that shows an appointment time, and it automatically shows up on my iOS calendar app with the specific time and addition descriptions.  I am looking for documentation on this.  <comment347786> This looks a bit like a [XY problem](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/66377/what-is-the-xy-problem). What do you want to accomplish once you have the documentation? Are you just curious about how it works, do you want to implement it in mails you send, are you debugging situations where it doesn't work, or something else? <comment347883> I want to know how it works and how i can implement it in emails I send
