Terminal window displays odd text after being resized <body> If I open a terminal window, and then shrink it as far left as possible, and then enlarge it again, it displays some odd text, including some of the letters in my hostname:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tY2nH.png" alt="Error Screenshot"  Any way to fix this?  Note: I'm guessing this is a bug, since when I go fullscreen, and then go back to a window, it goes back to normal and won't happen again.  Update: Some other weird stuff happens when I resize the window from using commands within the window.  <answer224553> It's a bug caused by Terminal's automatic text rewrapping combined with your shell's codeSIGWINCH/code re-rendering. If you just want to clear the corrupted text, you can use codeEdit-&gt;Clear All/code (default shortcut kbd âŒ˜ /kbd  + kbd K /kbd) to clear the window, leaving only the prompt.  <comment272343> It's a bug caused by Terminal's automatic text rewrapping combined with your shell's SIGWINCH rerendering. Nothing you can really do about it except to clear your terminal (Cmd+K).
