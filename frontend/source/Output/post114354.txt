How do I disable private browsing in Safari <body> One of my friends has a child who is being overly sneaky online (imagine that). She wants to disable the ability for her child to select "Private Browsing" in Safari. In her opinion, Parental Controls are too limiting for a teenager, but Private Browsing is too permissive. Is there a terminal command or other way to do this on OS X?  (Of note: I did see the trick of using Interface Builder to edit the NIB file to delete the option from the Safari Menu, but I think it would be beyond her tech ability to perform those steps. I also doubt she'd want to install Xcode).  Thanks for you help!  <answer114355> I could suggest something more evil :   Enable parental controls and use the logs !   Someone on Apple Support asked if private browsing disabled logging. It appears no, the parents controls will still log the websites. Even if the sneaky kids enable the private browsing, the logs will spill the beans !   <answer195357> Click on Safari. Click on Preferences. Click on General. Go to first choice "Safari opens with" select "a new window". Mine was selected on the choice of "Safari opens with" "a new private window". This had been driving me crazy for a month.  <answer261754> If logging isn't practical or you want to be more proactive and prevent Private Browsing from being accessible in the first place, it is possible (though not a short process) to disable Private Browsing if you are willing to mess with Safari's internal files.  h2Install the necessary files/h2  ol liInstall Xcode (available in the App Store)/li liDownload a zip file of Nib-Decompiler from GitHub (or clone the repository if you know how to do that)/li liOpen the codeNibDecompiler.xcodeproj/code Xcode project in Xcode/li liCompile the project.

Additionally, keyboard shortcuts are tied to menu items, so that's disabled too.  hr  sup * code~/code means your user home directory. codeLibrary/code is a hidden folder that isn't visible when you navigate to the home directory. You can get to this folder in the Finder by going to the "Go" menu and choosing "Connect to Folderâ€¦", then typing in code~/Library/code. You will then see the folders you need to copy files to./sup  Instructions copied from this MacRumors forum thread, updated for Safari 9 in this post.  <comment134018> Have you considered options such as [K9 Web Protection](http://www1.k9webprotection.com/)? <comment134029> Far more easy to log the websites on the router or via parental controls than it is to hack the app to change the behavior. +1 for solving the problem <comment134136> She had used OpenDNS filtering/monitoring in the past as a similar strategy. I'm not sure why she wants to go the disabling route instead. <comment311256> Thanks for this very simple answer. All that stuff about Terminal and scripts and all I wanted was this straight forward solution! <comment346392> This works perfectly, but once you've removed the menu option, you can still right click on the dock icon for safari and open a private window <comment348464> Or push cmd + shift + n for a new private window. <comment348575> @Joseph The key command is tied to the menu bar, and removing it removes the key command.
