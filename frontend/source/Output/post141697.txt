Are my battery cycle counts increasing when MBP is on and plugged in? <body> I often leave my Macbook Pro (13" - Late 2011) plugged in while working on it with the charge at 100%. This post suggests that when the battery is at 100% and the laptop is plugged in, the battery stops charging altogether.   Let's say I use my computer in this configuration for 10 hours at a time. strongWould this "cycle" of use actually contribute to my battery cycle count?/strong  <answer141714> If your battery is at 100% and your MacBook is plugged in then the battery isn't charging or discharging, so it isn't using a charging cycle.
