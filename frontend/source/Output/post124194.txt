how to build mysqlsniffer in os x 10.9 <body> I'm trying to build that (hackmysql.com/code/mysqlsniffer.tgz) in my mac.  I see only errors during compilation. I understand that is because of some gcc keys/options. Based on Google search i've figure out that codeunknown type name 'u_char'/code means that my compiler use another C standart, but which one should I use ? I've found instruction (how to build mysqlsniffer) for Linux users only, and certainly it does not work for mac.  precode$ gcc -m64 -g -O3 -lpcap -o mysqlsniffer *.c   In file included from misc.c:9: ./misc.h:10:15: error: unknown type name 'u_char'; did you mean 'char'? void dump_pkt(u_char *pkt, u_int len, char only_hex);               ^~~~~~               char ./misc.h:10:28: error: unknown type name 'u_int' void dump_pkt(u_char *pkt, u_int len, char only_hex);                            ^ /code/pre  Question: Is it possible to compile it on mac ?  My gcc is:  precode$ gcc --version Configured with: --prefix=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr --with-gxx-include-dir=/usr/include/c++/4.2.1 Apple LLVM version 5.1 (clang-503.0.38) (based on LLVM 3.4svn) Target: x86_64-apple-darwin13.1.0 Thread model: posix /code/pre  <comment145160> So basically you're using something written for Linux on OSX and wonder why it doesn't work? <comment145165> I'm not wonder, I'm asking is there any specific option or gcc's argument to compile linux software on BSD platform. Of course I don't know how much that software linux specific. But Why not ?
