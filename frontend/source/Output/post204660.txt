Blank Mail screen which then crashes but reminas open in background <body> The title sums it up. Once opened it simply doesn't show any emails and then eventually seems to crash but is open in the background still not showing anything.  <answer204661> Try to restart your Mac and see if that fixes it.  <comment246770> What version of OS X? What model Mac? Did you try installing an unsupported version of OS X to this machine? Have you deleted any system files recently? Are you running any automator functions for mail? Do you have a time machine back up that you can restore your Mac to a time before the error. Have you tried a restart?
