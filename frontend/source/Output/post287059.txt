Kernel Panic - Cause to worry or coincidence? <body> I have a 27-inch, late 2012, iMac running Sierra. On a recent boot up, I got the following screen, which I have since learned in a Kernel Panic message. I might have also been booting a hard drive while the main system was booting up. On a subsequent boot, the message did not reappear.   I'm kind of freaking out because I rely on my computer for business, do not have easy access to technical service where I am, and am afraid of pending CPU issues.  I've only seen this once, rebooted, and everything seems to be fine.  Might this have occurred because I was fiddling with a hard drive while booting up? Should I be worried, or simply chalk it up to coincidence? Thanks in advance.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qP4N3.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment362351> I would run [Apple Hardware Test (AHT)](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201257).  Hold the D key while booting from a powered off state with the AC adapter connected.  But "fiddling with your drive" is concerning given that "page fault" is swap space (hard drive volume)
