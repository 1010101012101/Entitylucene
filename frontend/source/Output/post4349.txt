Cannot restore or recover ipod Classic 80gb <body> I have an ipod Classic 80gb.   It is currently stuck on the apple screen.  I am unable to recover or restore the ipod.  It is not recognized by windows as either a ipod or a mass storage device.   When I plug it into my PC nothing happens.     It just sits there with the apple logo on the screen.  None of the buttons respond with the exception of a reset.  (toggle hold switch - hold center + menu for 6 seconds.)  A reset will cause the screen to go blank for a few seconds.    Nothing else I have found seems to work.    Let me know if you have any ideas  <answer4706> The hard disk has probably failed. If so, your options include:  ol liBuy a new iPod/li liBuy a replacement hard drive on eBay (etc) and replace it./li liFind a used iPod somewhere and swap parts to yours until it works./li /ol  <answer4707> You can try to diagnose the problem with the diagnostic mode.  To enter the diagnostic mode, press the folowing key when the apple logo appears after a reset :  strongiPod 1G, 2G et 3G, press the keys for 5 seconds :/strong   ul li"back"/li li"next"/li li"select"/li /ul  strongiPod 4G, 5G, mini et nano,  press the keys for 5 seconds :/strong  ul li"back"/li li"select"/li /ul  In the diagnotic mode, you can navigate in the menus with the back/next keys and launch a bunch of test.  <comment4523> Can you hear the disk spinning? <comment34896> If you buy a used iPod wouldn't you just sync that with your library, rather than swapping parts?
