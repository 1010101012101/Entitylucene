PF / IceFloor - Redirecting a service / port to a specific IP <body> What I'm trying to do is redirect all requests to a certain service or port to a specific IP address with IceFloor as the frontend for PF. In the example I'm posting en1 is my only enabled network adapter, 192.168.0.1 is the server I'm trying to redirect to and port 53 is the port I want to redirect all traffic for to that IP.  Icefloor has been letting me enter (but not completely add to the ruleset) these two lines through the custom rules page.  I don't get a bad syntax warning as though I've put in a bad rule, but the rules aren't appearing in either the icefloor custom rules GUI list or the icefloor.custom_rules file.  precoderdr on en1 inet proto tcp from any to any port 53 -&gt; 192.168.0.1 port 53 rdr on en1 inet proto udp from any to any port 53 -&gt; 192.168.0.1 port 53 /code/pre  Any ideas what I'm doing wrong, or if this is even possible?
