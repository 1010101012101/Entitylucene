Changing default symbols bound to option key? <body> When I type ⌥ and some letter a special character usually shows up - this would be really useful except for the fact that I have no use for a lot of these characters.  How can I customize which characters are bound to these shortcuts?  <answer148290> Create the folder code~/Library/KeyBindings//code and in it create a file called codeDefaultKeyBinding.dict/code and add whatever special character you need like so:  precode{     "~c" = (insertText:, "⌘"); } /code/pre  This makes kbd⌥/kbd+kbdc/kbd insert the symbol code⌘/code. For more information on this file and its syntax refere to this article. After editing the file you need to restart your application for the changes to take effect.  <comment173371> what Mac and OSX are you using. <comment173419> Macbook Air 2011, OSX 10.9.4
