Can I use the USB-C cable for my charger to transfer large files between different OS X laptops? <body> I have more than one Mac Book Pro, and need to transfer large files between them.  Can I repurpose the USBC cable for power to transfer between Mac Books?   Is there a better/faster cable, or way to transfer files between MacBooks?  <answer272560> The charger included with the 2016 MacBook Pro is a standard USB Type C cable. It should achieve speeds of up to 10gbps.  If you'd like speeds of up to 40gbps, I'd buy an official thunderbolt 3 cable from Apple. These should have the highest speeds.   NOTE: My bad, I looked into it and the cable is a standard USB C cable, not thunderbolt. Answer has been changed to reflect that.   <comment342547> I thought I read somewhere that not all USBC cables themselves are equal. <comment342561> @LamonteCristo well how big is the file you're moving? There are some sizes where it really won't matter. <comment342562> @LamonteCristo I noticed that the cable is actually USB c, not thunderbolt. The answer now reflects that. <comment342565> Thanks. This is the article that confused me earlier http://blog.fosketts.net/2016/10/29/total-nightmare-usb-c-thunderbolt-3/ <comment342567> @LamonteCristo it confused me too :). From what it seems, USB c is capped at 5, not 10. SSUSB (blue ports) are capped at 5. For maximum throughput, you'll want any thunderbolt 3 port
