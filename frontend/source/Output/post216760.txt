Splitting Partition On External Drive <body> I have a 1TB external drive with three partitions:  ul liFAT32 for extra storage (~500GB)/li liUbuntu (~499GB)/li liLinux swap space (~1GB)/li /ul  I want to boot to rEFind and then to Ubuntu from any Mac; preferably without destroying my Ubuntu install. I would like to split the FAT32 partition into two partitions:  ul liFAT32 space (500GB minus a few megabytes)/li libootable partition for rEFind (the aforementioned megabytes)/li /ul  How can I do this, for free, on OS X; preferably from Terminal or Disk Utility? Would making the extra storage partition bootable work?  <answer216764> Unfortunately OS X codeDisk Utility/code refuses to modify partitions on codeMBR/code disks. You can modify partitions form the command line using codefdisk/code. If you have a codeUbuntu/code machine you would be better to use this e.g. using codegparted/code to resize/move/create the partitions.
