How to disable Apple Push Notification Service (apsd) on OS X 10.8? <body> I am using an iMac at work, and the IT security guys are raising issue with the Apple Push Notification Service (apsd) trying to bypass the proxy continually.   I would like to know how I can disable apsd from running.  <answer92216> I figured out that I needed to enter the following in the terminal:  precodesudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.apsd.plist /code/pre  I did this already, and it seemed to fix the issue, but would love to know if this is the advisable way to solve the problem.  ========================================================  Also, in case you want to enable the process afterwards, you can use this:  precodesudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.apsd.plist /code/pre  sources:  https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/launchctl.1.html  http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/disabling-unnecessary-mac-osx-services/  <answer100555> Another solution would be to use Little Snitch and to block apsd from there.  <answer104622> As mentioned by Fabrice, Little Snitch is a means to solve this problem.  It doesn't answer the OP's actual question (which is how to disable apsd from running), but it can solve the sort of problem, albeit in a bandaid way, that the OP has.  With LS in place it's one button click solution to never hear from apsd again...   <answer118335> sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.applepushserviced.plist  For 10.7.5 FYI. The service name is expanded.  <answer145223> precodesudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.apsd.plist /code/pre  this will completely stop apsd as your background service.  Similar in linux, for those process that are running in code/etc/inittab/code  <answer278507> Maybe, it will be a safer alternative to use Little Snitch and a customized Hosts File to Block Apple stuff you don't want (If you are not planning to use Apple related services such as FaceTime, Messages, App Store and so on) You could also block, at the DNS level, Apple related domains that such process use.   h2Per Example:/h2  Hostnames:  a1441.g4.akamai.net         init-p01st.push.apple.com.edgesuite.net         init-p01st.push.apple.com     IP Addresses:   184.28.188.170         184.28.188.163     --- Hostnames:  35.courier-push-apple.com.akadns.net         24-courier.push.apple.com         21-courier.push.apple.com         13.courier-push-apple.com.akadns.net         9-courier.push.apple.com         6-courier.push.apple.com         32.courier-push-apple.com.akadns.net         13-courier.push.apple.com         34-courier.push.apple.com         17.courier-push-apple.com.akadns.net         34.courier-push-apple.com.akadns.net         47.courier-push-apple.com.akadns.net         46-courier.push.apple.com         39-courier.push.apple.com         9.courier-push-apple.com.akadns.net         47-courier.push.apple.com         11-courier.push.apple.com         43-courier.push.apple.com         14-courier.push.apple.com         19-courier.push.apple.com         41-courier.push.apple.com         8.courier-push-apple.com.akadns.net         1-courier.push.apple.com         24.courier-push-apple.com.akadns.net         17-courier.push.apple.com         21.courier-push-apple.com.akadns.net         10-courier.push.apple.com         38.courier-push-apple.com.akadns.net         38-courier.push.apple.com         6.courier-push-apple.com.akadns.net         32-courier.push.apple.com         8-courier.push.apple.com         35-courier.push.apple.com         18-courier.push.apple.com         1.courier-push-apple.com.akadns.net         43.courier-push-apple.com.akadns.net         11.courier-push-apple.com.akadns.net         10.courier-push-apple.com.akadns.net         sjc-courier.push-apple.com.akadns.net         19.courier-push-apple.com.akadns.net         18.courier-push-apple.com.akadns.net         14.courier-push-apple.com.akadns.net         46.courier-push-apple.com.akadns.net         41.courier-push-apple.com.akadns.net         39.courier-push-apple.com.akadns.net     IP Addresses:   17.249.28.28         17.249.28.27         17.249.28.30         17.249.28.19         17.249.28.36         17.249.28.22         17.249.28.31         17.249.28.12         17.249.28.21         17.249.28.25         17.249.28.32         17.249.28.8         17.249.28.24         17.249.28.10         17.249.28.18         17.249.28.11         17.249.28.33         17.249.28.34         17.249.28.13         17.249.28.23         17.249.28.26         17.249.28.35         17.249.28.20         17.249.28.15         17.249.28.17     ----  The above, is just a small example of all Apple's process / services phoning home. The full list is Extensive. I block them at both; At the App level (Using Little Snitch) and at the DNS level (Hosts File) because they Tend to bypass or go around the back of VPN connections. So, I consider them a Privacy and Security Breach. I Love my Mac, but I don't use any apple related apps and services.   AS per Little Snitch, you have to Uncheck some predefined settings. So, next time an Apple process kicks in, such as the apsd process, you can then choose to block all outgoing connections.   To Edit the Hosts File on your Mac, Open Finder, Go to Folder, write: /etc/hosts and the open using TextWrangler. Don't forget to use  0.0.0.0  as a Prefix on all your entries, you can use other commands on TextWrangler such as Sort, Add Line Breaks, and so on. Then, just save and reboot.  If you try to Disable some Apple process via Terminal, you may be required to disable first SIP, which I personally preferred to live it alone. (Operation not permitted while System Integrity Protection is engaged)  <comment108206> I know that apsd uses port 5223, so I was thinking I could just close that port, but not sure if this would work or if it would just assign another port to the service... <comment369983> with latest macOS I receive this error `/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.apsd.plist: Operation not permitted while System Integrity Protection is engaged`. Any idea howto disable this spyware service? I don't wish to reduce security with `csrutil disable`. Thanks
