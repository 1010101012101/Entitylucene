Is there a beginners guide to Unix from the OS X point of view? <body> I'm hoping to build on my embarrassingly-limited knowledge of the command line, and I know there are a ton of great resources out there. I'm wondering if there are any books or other resources that are tailored specifically to the OS X user running Terminal.  Thanks.  <answer9979> This Mac OS X Unix Tutorial has a lot of information in there which you could start from. All in all, I think that if you start up with any of the good resources on Linux (or Unix), you should be able to get up to speed with most aspects of Unix on OS X.   <answer9989> Well, there is always Apple´s official command line guide but back when I learned my way around the Terminal, I found Unix for the beginning Mage (PDF, free) quite entertaining emand/em educational (given it suits your humour).   If you´d rather go for a book, I´d highly recommend "The Mac OS X Command Line: Unix Under the Hood".  <answer9990> O'Reilly has several Learning UNIX for Mac OS X books. They were all published several years ago, and the most recent one is for Tiger. But they are still relevant to UNIX, as one of the great things about UNIX is that the fundamentals are quite stable.   <answer9994> I'm a fan of Take Control of the Mac Command Line with Terminal, by Joe Kissell. It's a $10 ebook that is specifically designed for beginning command line users on Mac OS X. I think it's exactly what you asked for. I find many O'Reilly UNIX books to be frustratingly opaque for the beginner.  Book blurb from the above link:     If you've ever thought you should   learn how to use the Unix command line   that underlies Mac OS X, or felt at   sea when typing commands into   Terminal, Joe Kissell is here to help!   This 111-page ebook will help you   become comfortable working on the   Mac's command line, starting with the   fundamentals and walking you through   more advanced topics as your knowledge   increases. And if you're uncertain how   to put your new-found skills to use,   Joe includes numerous real-life   "recipes" for tasks that are best done   from the command line.   Disclaimer: Though I wrote a Take Control book seven years ago, I have no financial interest in Joe's book.  <answer9997> There is this kid on youtube who runs the macheads channel - best place to start learning the terminal is his 21 part series - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaIBH4fNqOc  Another source I would point to is the Meet the Command Line series by Dan Benjamin at Peepcode: http://peepcode.com/products/meet-the-command-line  <answer96172> I have a newsletter and upcoming screencast specifically for OS X users, which you can follow here:  http://learning-the-unix-command-line-on-os-x.chipcastle.com/  <answer96181> http://wiki.bash-hackers.org/scripting/tutoriallist has reviews of some bash tutorials for beginners.
