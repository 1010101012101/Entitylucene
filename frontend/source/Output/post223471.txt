How to open specific port in EI Captain? <body> I have gone through many articles (please list emone/em article you are following so we might suggest a better or at least follow along) and found the same solution but no result??  I have done -   precodesudo nano etc/pf.conf /code/pre  and added:   precode# Open port 100 for TCP on all interfaces pass in proto tcp from any to any port 100 /code/pre  and saved it.  Then to verify:   precodesudo pfctl -vnf /etc/pf.conf /code/pre  it results in:   precodepfctl: Use of -f option, could result in flushing of rules   present in the main ruleset added by the system at startup.   See /etc/pf.conf for further details.  scrub-anchor "/*" all fragment reassemble   nat-anchor "/*" all   rdr-anchor "/*" all   anchor "/*" all   pass in proto tcp from any to any port = 100 flags S/SA keep state   dummynet-anchor "/*" all    Loading anchor com.apple from /etc/pf.anchors/com.apple   anchor "/*" all   anchor "/*" all    sudo pfctl -vnf /etc/pf.conf /code/pre  But when I check in network utility port scan it doesn't shows that port is opened.  Also tried with turning off firewall.  I'm running OS X 10.11.2 and don't know how to forward my local host to a public IP using 80 port without doing anything but I want it to be forwarded to port 100 instead.  <comment270954> It's unclear **what** you want to forward and why? Do you want to run a web server on your host using port 100 instead of port 80/443? <comment270972> I'm also having problems understanding what you need help with. Could you edit in two things in your post. 1) what process will listen on a port? You can test with `sudo python -m SimpleHTTPServer 100` and you should get a firewall permission dialog and then port 100 should be open if you approve the app to listen. 2) edit out all the port forwarding - that's another question for ssh and likely already asked/answered. If you can refine the port opening issue, I think this can get a speedy answer... <comment271107> I can not say specifically why , I am playing around with too many things and needed to learn this. <comment311468> This doesnt seem to work on El Capitan ?? Any ideas
