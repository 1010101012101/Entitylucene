iMessage / iCloud via SSH Port forward to get through firewall <body> What ports does iCloud and iMessage use and is it possible to use SSH port forwarding via  a proxy to use them on a network that blocks the services?  <answer170237> According to: http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202078  precode| Ports                     |FaceTime | iMessage| | 80 (TCP)                  |    ✓    |    ✓    | | 443 (TCP)                 |    ✓    |    ✓    | | 3478 through 3497 (UDP)   |    ✓    |    -    | | 5223 (TCP)                |    ✓    |    ✓    | | 16384 through 16387 (UDP) |    ✓    |    -    | | 16393 through 16402 (UDP) |    ✓    |    -    | /code/pre  Which means 80, 443, and 5223  hr  emThat being said I have YET to actually tunnel iMessage correctly/em  <answer207213> So I think i've found a way to accomplish this (however) its more of an idea right now than a reality.  The concept would be to stand up a socks ssh proxy codessh HOST -D 1080/code and then write a custom codeproxy.pac/code file that routes specific sties through this socks connection  Directions on how to write one of these proxy things are here: https://mikewest.org/2007/01/auto-configuring-proxy-settings-with-a-pac-file  If i ever make progress i will update this answer.
