How can I log into an azure VM via my Mac? <body> Recently switched to Macs.  I have some Azure VMs. In Windows, I just need to boot up the remote connections dialog, put in the server and credentials and it should log me in.  Is there a similar sort of thing for OSX as well?  <answer111630> You just need a Remote Desktop Client.  Microsoft has an official one called Microsoft Remote Desktop, that is free. It's available on the App Store.  There are other alternatives as well, such as CoRD.
