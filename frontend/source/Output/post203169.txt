Property to force launching in full screen <body> Is there any property that forces an application to start in full screen if it supports it?  I noticed in code~/Library/Saved Application State/com.mycompany.myapp.savedState/windows.plist/code there's a key that saves the window state on some applications.  precode&lt;array&gt;     &lt;dict&gt;         &lt;key&gt;NSIsFullScreen&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;true/&gt; /code/pre  Some applications write it while open but don't save it and then start again not in full screen. And locking codewindows.plist/code will log an error and the app will still launch in a window.
