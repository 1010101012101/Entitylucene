Target iMac does not wake up with the main iMac, but works the other way around! <body> I have two 27inch iMacs, both 2011.  When I connect iMac A to iMac B and let it sleep, iMac B's display does not wake up.  However, it still shows up in the Displays and I can still play audio through it.  When I connect iMac A to iMac B to use as an external display, they both wake up after sleep.  Why does it work one way and not the other?
