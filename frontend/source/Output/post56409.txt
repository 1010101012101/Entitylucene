How to copy files from an unbootable Mac? <body> My MacBook Pro (2008) will not boot, so I want to copy some files before reinstalling Lion.  How do I do this from the Recovery disc?  <answer56410> You might try using Target Disk Mode - hold down kbdT/kbd at startup and then connect the MacBook Pro to another Mac (or a PC that can read Mac drives) via FireWire or Thunderbolt.   Or try holding down the Shift key to boot into Safe Boot mode.  If neither of those work, try booting from your MacBook Pro's system restore DVD, use Disk Utility and try repairing the disk, or try a 3rd party utility such as the venerable DiskWarrior.  <answer56411> All the methods above are good and I'd start with the Target Disk Mode attempt.  Also, I definitely second DiskWarrior.  However, if all else fails, I'd recommend pulling the hard drive and running Sleuth Kit.  It's rather complicated and mainly CLI, so research it first.  http://www.sleuthkit.org/  <answer56413> I recommend using a Linux Live disk, specifically...  h1Linux Mint/h1  ... as is comes with codenautilus gksu/code preinstalled. (This allows you to easily open folders as admin.)  You simply boot from the Linux Live disk, and use it to access your files on the Macintosh HD as administrator which allows you to copy them to an attached external hard drive.  Here's a short strongvideo tutorial on youtube/strong. Note, that this tutorial uses an older version of Linux Mint.  <answer77611> Boot up in Recovery Mode (Command + R) add attach an external drive via USB. Then open the Terminal to copy files using the command line. All disks are available under /Volumes.  <comment64743> Do you have access to another Mac? (or a PC, but that would be trickier). <comment64751> I have an iMac as well. <comment64753> I don't have a FireWire or Thunderbolt cable, otherwise that'd be the perfect answer.  Safe boot mode didn't work unfortunately.  I'm going to try Linux Mint first, and if that doesn't work, I'll try DiskWarrior.  Thanks. <comment64754> If all else fails, I think I'll end up pulling the disk.  Thanks <comment64755> Trying that now... Thanks <comment64800> I couldn't get the MBP to recognise the disc. I only had some DVDs kicking around so will try a CDR in the hope that works.  I also tried a bootable Ubuntu USB but that wasn't recognised either. <comment64801> @Paul Bootable Linux USB on Macs are almost always a trouble to get to work. So, try CDs/DVDs first. When you see two boot options (*Windows* and *Efi*), I recommend to choose Windows, as Linux EFI boot still has many driver problems. <comment64802> That's the thing - I'm not even seeing the Linux option to be able to boot into it. I only see the Mac HD, and the Recovery HD.  Any ideas? <comment64803> @Paul Try a *[PRAM reset](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1379)*. If you still don't see the Linux disk then, somethings really wrong. You should add that to your question. <comment64804> BTW: You press the *Alt* key upon boot, right? Just making sure.... <comment64805> Yep, the alt key. Just tried the PRAM reset and still no Linux disk on the boot screen... <comment64806> I've had no luck with bootable Linux so have ordered a Firewire cable from Amazon. <comment64807> So, I guess this is a hardware failure? You probably need to get the HDD and put it into an enclosure and try to recover the data. If the Mac does not see the Linux CD, it also should not see the OSX install disk/usb, I think. <comment305170> You just saved my bacon.
