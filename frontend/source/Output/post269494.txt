Send an email as an attachment from iPhone <body> This may be the most easy question to answer but I have struggled for few days now to get a proper view on how to achieve attaching an email on another email in iPhone 7.  I am a new iPhone user and would like to achieve  ol liAttach existing email onto new email/li liAttach existing email to a reply/forward email/li /ol  Is this at all possible?  <answer269525> Currently, you can't send an email as an attachment on iOS. The only functionality available is to use the Forward button to quote a copy of the email (with or without the original attachments).  (On macOS mail.app, right-click on a message and select Forward as Attachment.)  <comment338526> @klanomath I prefer answer, please don't show your editing skills to earn points, I am not new to stackexchange <comment338529> Please check my reputation and compare it with [this](http://apple.stackexchange.com/help/privileges) list: I don't get any points editing your question.
