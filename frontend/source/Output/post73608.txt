Is it possible to check the DNS server you're using on the iphone? <body> on windows, you'd use something like ipconfig /all to see the dns server you're hitting.  What would u do on an iphone or mobile device?  <answer73610> You can see the DNS assigned to the Wi-Fi in strongSettings â†’ Wi-Fi/strong, then tapping on the blue arrow next to the network you're connected to. I'm not sure if it's possible to do the same for the cellular connection however.  <comment85516> ah that's useful. but yeah, it would be good to be able to do it for 3G too
