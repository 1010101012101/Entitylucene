Home folder has two Desktops within it - can one be deleted? <body> Somehow I created a second Desktop Folder and icon within my Home Folder. One Desktop has the word original following it, the second has a different icon.  Can any suggest how this happened and can I get rid of one of them?  <answer94201> strongThe code~/Desktop/code folder is the one you should keep/strong since it contains your actual desktop. It should be the one with Apple's Desktop folder icon on it.  The code~/Desktop (original)/code (I presume the emoriginal/em is in brackets) is from Migration Assistant (and/or Time Machine) unless you manually created it yourself. You can take out files that you need and place them elsewhere, then delete the folder.  <comment110457> You should copy all the things inside the original Desktop to the actual current Desktop to make sure that you don't lose anything if you delete it. <comment110458> And to answer your question - after removing the items from Desktop (original) just drag it to the trash
