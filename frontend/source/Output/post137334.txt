Unable to add account in Google Hangouts <body> I've been unable to login to Google Hangouts via the iPhone mobile app. I keep getting "Unable to add account". I've tried restarting my phone, nothing changes. If it helps, I am using a legacy business account from Google.  iPhone: 5sbr OS: iOS 7.1.2br App: Hangouts from Google Inc, 2.1.0  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EbMkl.png" width="320" title="Unable to add account"  <answer140082> You have to enable Google+ in your Google App account to let your phone use Hangout. Login to Google App admin, then choose "More controls" at the bottom and choose "Other Google Services". Then you can see Google+ in the list.  <comment163188> Are you able to log into Hangouts using that account in a web browser? <comment163189> Yes, I am able to log into Hangouts using any web browser on my computer. <comment163191> If you are using a Google Apps account, do you know if Hangouts is enabled for your account? Your admin needs to enable Hangouts, but I'm assuming they've already done that if you can log into Hangouts using a web browser. https://support.google.com/a/answer/4213662 <comment163194> I definitely do have access to the Google Hangouts. http://i.imgur.com/hYr6TOi.png
