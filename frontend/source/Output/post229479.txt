Unable to get a local notification for NSCurrentLocaleDidChangeNotification <body> I am new to iOS development. I have implemented the following sample code to test if i can receive a notification for locale change(In my case, I need to get a notification when I change the language). But when I change the language and come back to the app, I am not getting the log statement which I have given. Is it the way to get the notification? If yes, what might be the reason for not getting the log displayed.  precode-(void)applicationDidBecomeActive:(UIApplication *)application { [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self                                          selector:@selector(notify:)                                               name:NSCurrentLocaleDidChangeNotification                                             object:nil]; }  -(void)notify:(NSNotification*)notification {     NSLog(@"Notification observed"); } /code/pre
