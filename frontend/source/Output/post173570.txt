Shortcut to copy text to clipboard and then search it on safari? <body> is there a shortcut for this: I'm on Safari and see a term I'd like to google. Maybe an obscure term or something I want more information of (gadget, e.g.) Now what I do is:  ol liI copy the text/li liopen a new tab/li lipaste the text /li liand press enter./li /ol  Is there a shortcut? Like copy+search key combination?  Thanks!  <answer173571> Highlight the text, right-click and select Search with Google from the contextual menu.                              img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dWIAx.gif" alt=""  This can be automated with Keyboard Maestro.  <answer173580> Using the built in 'Search With Google' service for strongSafari/strong you can assign it a shortcut key combo.  I had to make sure that the normal service did not have a shortcut. Giving it one here does not work on my 10.10.2 os x  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/myWUc.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  Now add a new strongApplication/strong shortcut for strongSafari/strong: Using codeSearch With Google/code  as the Menu title.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/v9xwR.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/us7iu.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  You then may have to relaunch Safari for it to pick it up and you can use it.  But now all you need to do is select some text in Safari and use the shortcut.  <comment204218> Does it have to be keyboard shortcut? Because there's builtin context menu called *Search with Google* when You right click on selected text.
