I forgot what my Apple ID was, but I remember my password. How can I find my e-mail? <body> So I remembered an older account that I had with apple and I remember the password. I remember there being a lot of games I liked and would like those back without having to pay again.  Can someone help?  <answer277863> Apple made a site just to help you and others:  ul lihttps://iforgot.apple.com/li /ul  Then click the link that says strongForgot Apple ID?/strong
