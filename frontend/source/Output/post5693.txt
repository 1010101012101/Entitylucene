How to sync mail between PC and Mac <body> I have both a Mac and a PC. On the PC I use Outlook.  My question is, how do I sync mail between the PC and Mac? Previously I was keeping the .pst file from the PC on an external HD so I could see it on all my PCs, but now with a Mac, I'm at loss as to what to do. I still plan to use both Mac and PC.  <answer5694> My first instinct is to suggest using IMAP and just keeping all your mail etc on the server. Then it is as simple as using Thunderbird or another Mac compatible mail client up to date with your email accounts.  However, I am assuming you have a reason to not go this route. An alternative would be to use Outlook for Mac if you're familiar with Outlook and wish to keep using it (and are okay with shelling out a little bit of money for it). I would like to believe that Microsoft kept compatibility with pst files alive in the transition.  <answer5695> If you are looking for backup &amp; Restore of mails, you would love to use strongGMAIL back-up utility/strong. I usually forward all mails from my account(a setting to send a copy to other account) to gmail account &amp; I can always have backup on gmail. I can download all mails from GMAIL-Backup utility &amp; similarly restore to specific account. This is what I did when I want to have backup of mails &amp; transfer it to mac. You might not like the answer. But I explained what I did. So, this would be just a suggestion instead of an answer. ( once you have backup of all mails using gmail-Backup, you can copy in to pen-drive &amp; then you can use it anywhere you want )   <comment5892> Maybe he does not use IMAP because he does not know it. For me, IMAP is the only reasonable way to achieve his goal. <comment5906> Also, Mail.app on the Mac supports IMAP. And I don't think the two outlooks can 'share' the PST. <comment5907> Do you know what type of mail server you are using? How is your mail client set up currently? Do you know if you are using IMAP or POP? <comment5927> @jmlumpkin To my knowledge, they can't share it. I assume the OP was separately importing the pst into each, which is rather painful. Hopefully IMAP is a possibility for the OP so he can avoid that fate. <comment86174> Use IMAP.  You get builtin support that can sync Macs, PCs, tablets, smartphones, whatever.
