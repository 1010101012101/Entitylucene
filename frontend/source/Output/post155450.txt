If I store music in CloudDrive, can I play it in somehow? <body> I do not realy like this iTunes syncronization, connect device with cabel, start iTunes, .. too complicate. Can I sync and play music via CloudDrive?  <answer155463> No. Unless you use a specific third-party app that allows this (I don't know of any) then synchronisation of music from a computer to an iOS device with iCloud Drive is not possible.   However, you may find that iTunes Wi-Fi syncing sufficiently solves the problem you describe of having to physically connect your iOS device to your computer in order to synchronise media.   <comment182858> No, that is not possible. <comment182873> Do you know wether I can access iTunes music library from iOS App? Because iCloud Drive I can access.
