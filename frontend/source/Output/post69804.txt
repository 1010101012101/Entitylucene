How to remove old device from Safari iCloud Tabs? <body> I returned a MacBook to Apple Store, however apparently I forgot to sign out of iCloud and the latest tabs I was browsing still appear in Safari iCloud Tabs of my new MacBook and existing iPad.  I removed the device from icloud.com - Find My iPhone but it didn't work. Tabs list from my old computer is still there and I am trying to remove it from my devices list. I appreciate any ideas.  <answer69831> From Apple's iCloud Tabs support article (emphasis added):     If you can't access the device that shared the tab, emthe tab will automatically be cleared from the list after 14 days if the tab isn't updated/em.   So, any leftover tabs should be gone after two weeks.  <answer197209> Read this Article.
