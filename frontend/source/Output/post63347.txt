Are there non-English books in the iBookstore? <body> All I'm seeing in the iBookstore are titles in English.  Are there any non-English (specifically Russian) public-domain books in the iBookstore?  <answer63366> I did searches for Tolstoy, Pushkin, and Dostoyevski and found at least one Russian language book under each one.  Are these not there for you?  <comment73223> The russian iBook store looks rather non-russian indeed. But there are non-english books available e.g. in german, french, italian etc. <comment73225> Which national iBookstore is your Apple ID connected to? The US store has different titles than the UK store [and so on...](http://thenextweb.com/apple/2011/09/29/apple-adding-25-new-countries-to-ibookstore-market/) <comment73226> Is there even such a thing as language-oriented iBookstores? On my iPhone I can only see one huge list of public domain books (some of them are in other languages as you said), but is it possible to filter by language at all? <comment73227> @patrix, I see these options now on the iTunes, thanks. Sucks there's no Russian :-( <comment73228> @bmike, not Russia, but I'd expect all public domain works to be available in all countries. <comment73260> Like patrix said, the iBook store looks rather non-russian, but there are some Russian books on it. They are just difficult to find. https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4058126?start=0&tstart=0 <comment73448> I meant books in the Russian language. iBooks has a variety of translations (even to languages other than English), but not the original works (at least none that I could find - if you succeeded, what were your exact search queries?). However, I did run your search, and for Pushkin there's a poem ("To the beauty who sniffed tobacco") in Russian. Not quite what I was hoping for, but it answers the question :-)
