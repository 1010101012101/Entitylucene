How can I create Apple ID for a child without a Credit Card? <body> I am trying to create an Apple ID for my 10-year-old son. However, I do not have a Credit Card, only a Debit Card. I'm using the iCloud 'Family' setting, but it says 'Credit Card Required'. I guess this is because, legally, someone under 18 may have a Debit Card, but you must be 18 to have a Credit Card. How can I bypass this? I'm using an iPhone 4S, running the latest iOS update (I updated today). What should I do?  <answer180504> ol liSign out./li liSearch for any free app./li liSelect "Get" and "Install App"./li liYou should see screen, that you need to log in to download.
