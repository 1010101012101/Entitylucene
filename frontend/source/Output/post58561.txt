Can OS X apps access my contacts even if I don't give them permission? <body> After I upgraded to Mountain Lion, I noticed that apps have started asking for permission to access my contacts.  Very cool.  When Skype initially asked for permission to access my contacts, I decided not to grant it.  However, when I loaded Skype this morning, I noticed that my Skype contacts screen was still getting populated from my Address Book.  I double-checked in the Security prefpane, and Skype still does emnot/em have permission to access my contacts.  How is Skype getting my contacts?  Can apps access my Address Book even if I have explicitly denied them permission?  <answer58572> As this was an upgrade install, you had used Skype already for quite a while, right? I assume that Skype is simply displaying strongits own database/strong which it build-up before Mountain Lion.  I myself don't use Skype, so I just installed it and used my firewall to monitor what files Skype accesses:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bTZOo.png" alt="enter image description here"  During the setup I was also prompted by Mountain Lion if I wanted to grant access to my contacts. I denied access. If I had granted access to my Contacts, the firewall would have intercepted as a second barrier (I've set it up this way). But this was not necessary.  After several restarts Skype had written to code~/Library/Address Book Plug-Ins//code, but your contacts are stored in code~/Library/Application Support/AddressBook/code. As you see in the first picture, Skype never gained access to my contacts.  And indeed, there are no entries in Skype's own address book:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1U5hD.png" alt="enter image description here"  So what you have probably achieved now in Mountain Lion is that Skype will not gain access to any strongnew Contacts/strong that you add to your address book. When Skype had access to your contacts in Lion, it copied them already and there's nothing you can do to undo that.  <comment67409> I'm not sure how Skype works, but perhaps Sykpe already imported the contacts into itself before, so it has them already? If you add a new contact into your Address Book does it appear in Skype? <comment67412> Makes sense. That's what I was going to say too. <comment67413> "and there's nothing you can do to undo that", well, you could just remove them from Skype. <comment67414> @vcsjones I bet Skype has copied them to its servers. Just like many other social apps. *That* is the actual problem :( <comment67962> Confirmed.  I deleted the contents of `~/Library/Application Support/Skype`, and my Address Book contacts no longer appear in Skype.
