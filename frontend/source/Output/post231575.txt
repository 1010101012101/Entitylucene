Does Mac offer a way to return video specs in terminal without ffmpeg? <body> I was curious to know if there is a way in Mac terminal to return a video's details similar to sips is for images on the Mac before I install ffmpeg?  I am currently using Yosemite so if there an alternative has been developed for Yosemite for getting video specs through terminal other than ffmpeg or ffprobe please advise.  After research the only Q&amp;A returned is: Terminal tool to join mp4 videos  <comment282800> Have you tried using `mdls`? <comment282801> What is that?  I'm not familiar with it <comment282802> From its manual page: "mdls -- lists the metadata attributes for the specified file" <comment282804> would that list the frame rates and compression because the man page doesn't have much detail <comment282819> Is there any reason why you can't just test `mdls` against a video file and see what it outputs!?
