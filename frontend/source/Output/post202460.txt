Having trouble with file sharing between two Macs <body> Due to slow Internet I have two Mac mini's on two different networks and moving data between these two Macs have been a problem for me as disabling my hard drive and moving it to the other Mac is starting to annoy me a lot. I move a lot of data daily and I really want to just find a way to make it easier for me. I use one more than the other and want to keep one as my main one and the other will be just for monitoring and quick use.  So is there a way that I can connect these Macs that are on two different networks via Intranet? (Or maybe have like an offline Dropbox connected via FireWire?)  <answer202464> Without knowing the distance between the Macs, you would connect them as follows:  ul liThunderbolt networking/li liEthernet direct connect/li liEthernet to a gigabit switch/li liEthernet to an ethernet switch/li liEthernet to a router/li liWireless to a router/li liUsing the slow internet you mention/li /ul  <comment244204> This is even trickier without more data. Why would slow internet make two Mac Mini be on different networks? Why not string a cable between the two and have gigabit or better speeds? What does "disabling my hard drive and moving it to the other mac" do? are you implementing a sneaker net for data transfer? <comment244206> Ive just did some reading about Airdrop <comment244207> You don't mention the distance separating these two minis. Are they in the same room, house, neighborhood, etc? <comment244208> Since you commented AirDrop - that is far far far slower than an ethernet cable between the two devices, so unless you really can't string a cable, wired is superior to wireless for large data transfers.
