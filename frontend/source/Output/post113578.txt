share screenshots with Dropbox does not work <body> the automatically share screenshots with Dropbox does not work for me in 10.9. Iâ€™m not sure what to do, already installed the latest version of Dropbox  <answer113581> I personally don't have this active on my Dropbox account by default but of you I tried it out on my 10.9 system.   It doesn't work for me either and this could either be because of the OS or Dropbox. What I suspect is that OS X won't allow the changing of the screen shot location from a third party app.   What you can do as a work around is the following:  Launch Terminal and use the following syntax:  precodedefaults write com.apple.screencapture location /path/ /code/pre  For example, if I want to have the screenshots appear in a specific Dropbox folder, you would use:  precodedefaults write com.apple.screencapture location ~/Dropbox/Pictures/Screenshots /code/pre  Log out or restart your Mac and take a screenshot. This should now automatically place the image in the new folder and thus Dropbox is syncing.  For additional fun check out: http://secrets.blacktree.com/?showapp=com.apple.screencapture
