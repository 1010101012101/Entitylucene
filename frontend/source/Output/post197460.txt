Why keyboard shortcut "ctrl + left" doesn't work? <body> I'm used to switch between my desktop spaces using kbdctrl/kbd + arrows. But kbdctrl/kbd + kbd←/kbd doesn't work while kbdctrl/kbd + kbd→/kbd works fine.  Here is my settings:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tK4dQ.png" alt="System Preferences &gt; Keyboard &gt; Keyboard Shortcuts &gt; Mission Control"  <answer197466> To solve this problem:  ol liChange keys for shortcut to kbd⌘CMD/kbd + kbd←/kbd (or anything else). But it won't work after that yet./li liReboot your mac./li likbd⌘CMD/kbd + kbd→/kbd now is working./li liChange keys to kbdctrl/kbd + kbd←/kbd./li /ol  <comment236055> OS version: 10.10.4 (14E46)  MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Early 2013) <comment236058> did you try to click on it a reassign it ! or try using the "cmd" instead of "ctrl". A Question, did you reassign the cmd and ctrl  keys, since it is normally the "cmd" not the ctrl. <comment236061> @Buscar웃SD after reassign it still doesn't work, but after rebooting it works fine. Thanks you! <comment236063> Sorry, forgot to say you need to reboot :) <comment237684> I always set these to ^⌘← and ^⌘→ so that they work the same as on my Linux installation.
