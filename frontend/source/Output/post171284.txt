Xserv Mac os x server serial number <body> I Have a Xserve!When i Power on the xserv this window opens!where can i found serial number? or how i can install a new mac os x? please help meimg src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aB9pi.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer171286> The serial number is printed on a card that came with the installation DVDs.  If you don't have this card, or the DVDs, then maybe the original owner still has a record of it.  <comment201509> thank you! can i install a newest version? <comment201510> That depends on how old the Xserve is.  According to http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201475 only the 2009 Xserve is supported.  And, even if you upgraded the base OS, you would need to purchase the Server.app for Yosemite in order to do server-type stuff.
