What file systems does Apple use in iPhones? <body> h1HFS/h1  WWDC 2012 Session 709, ￼emWhat’s New in the File System/em, presented by Deric Horn included the following observation: Journaled HFS+ everywhere.  In the iOS Developer Library, NSDictionary Class Reference contains references to emHFS/em.   Do iPhones use HFS Plus?  Journaled or not journaled?  I'd like an authoritative reference. Thanks.   hr  h2Types of HFS Plus/h2  iOS and iPhone aside for a moment … Apple's hdiutil(1) Mac OS X Manual Page lists four HFS emfilesystem types/em for creation purposes:  ul liHFS+/li liHFS+J (JHFS+)/li liHFSX/li liJHFS+X/li /ul  hr  h3Postscript/h3  Beyond the accepted answer … as Apple sometimes distinguishes between strongJHFS+X/strong (journaled, case sensitive) and strongHFSX/strong, so:   ul liextra kudos to anyone who can verify whether, in an iPhone, strongboth/strong HFSX slices are journaled /li /ul  … I do have fileXray, but I don't foresee myself making an ssh connection to my first generation iPhone ;-)  <answer107887> strongAccording to iOS Forensic Analysis, the main filesystem is HFSX/strong.     h3HSFX/h3      All Apple mobile devices use HFSX as the file system. HFSX is a variation of HFS+ with one major difference. HFSX is case sensitive.    HFSX is reported by Apple as Mac OS Extended (Journaled, Case-Sensitive).  There are two main partitions of HFSX: the OS and the user data. Prior to these partitions is the usual MBR partition (around 100 MB).  hr  SSHing into my jailbroken iOS 6 device seems to support this, since I can create case-sensitive directories. Creating the following directories was no problem:  precode$ mkdir test $ mkdir Test $ mkdir TEST /code/pre  <comment126534> In the book neither *JHFS+X* nor *JHFSX* is mentioned, which made me wonder whether it's case-sensitive *without* a journal. But then, where Sean Morrissey uses [fileXray](http://filexray.com): **kHFSVolumeJournaled (volume has a journal)** … I wonder whether that's true for both HFSX slices of the disk. I'll add something to the question. <comment126536> Background: https://twitter.com/jollyjinx/status/395193114941734912 observes breakage of an original photo on an iPhone. <comment126623> Weird, I sought answers a few times before posting this question. I don't know how the duplicate was missed. Maybe because I sought iPhone instead of iOS. I'll add a tag to the earlier question. <comment342819> If all goes well, after iOS 10.3 they will be using APFS: https://arstechnica.com/apple/2017/01/ios-10-3-will-be-apples-first-update-to-convert-storage-to-apfs/
