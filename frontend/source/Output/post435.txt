My personal settings on OS X disappear after booting Windows (XP or 7) on my MacBook Pro <body> I installed Windows 7 (and XP before) on my MacBook Pro and whenever I boot my Windows and after that boot my OS X my clock shows the wrong time and strongmy login items that I set in the system preference  Accounts/strong disappear!   I have also lost my strongsecond language added/strong! Indeed I lost all my specimen settings.  Someone told me that's because MBP don't have BIOS and that causes the problem to happen. Does anyone know how must I solve it?  P.S: asked this question before on superuser and get this answer about to edit registry and set RealTimeIsUniversal to 1.     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\TimeZoneInformation   but it just solve the time problem.  this is my login items but I don't think it related to apps was set here because I changed them many times and still have the problem.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zyAS6.png" alt="alt text"  <answer436> strongAbout the time :/strong  You have to tell Windows that the clock is UTC.  To do this, edit the following in the registry :  precodeHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE  SYSTEM   CurrentControlSet    Control     TimeZoneInformation      RealTimeIsUniversal /code/pre  and set it to a codeDValue/code of 1.  <answer550> Try to backup and delete the file under code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginitems.plist/code  This will remove the login item you have and Mac OS X will create a new (clean) one.  For more information:    ul liDo you by any chance use some kind of app cleaner on your Mac that would delete code.plist/code files?/li liWhen on Windows, do you mount your Mac partition with read access?/li /ul  <comment404> this just solve time issue and some one on superuser told me how solve other problem? <comment405> What's the point with the clock setting ? I don't see how they're related. <comment406> I just want said that this registry solve the clock issue not the problem about I lost my login items that I set in the system. <comment407> Ok â€¦ So you should probably change the title of your question as I'm pretty sure that the clock settings are not related to the lost of login items. <comment408> Actually, I believe you should post another question about the login. And accept this answer for the wrong date issue. <comment410> as I edit my question I explain that the date issue was solved before in superuser I just copy & paste my question from there, and also I changed my title, Sorry for any inconvenience caused. <comment411> Like the person told you on Super User, you've got two problems, so you've got to ask two questions. Since the time problem is solved, **remove it (the registry hack) from this question**. This led @studer to think you still had a time difference problem and might fool other people too. <comment413> If you reboot OS X without booting in Windows, do the login items disappear? I can't see why booting to Windows would mess up the Mac OS X login items. <comment418> no it won't disappear, if I directly boot my os x. <comment428> can you update your post with the list of your login items? <comment508> I try this later and inform you the result.
