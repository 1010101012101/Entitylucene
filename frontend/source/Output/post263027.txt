Quitting app regains focus <body> I'm very annoyed with focus management on macOS since El Capitan. When I quit Safari (or any other app, that takes some time to quit) with kbd⌘/kbdkbdQ/kbd and then immediately press kbd⌘/kbdkbdSpace/kbd to activate  Alfred or Spotlight, the Alfred/Spotlight window shows up for a second, but then disappears before I can enter the command for Alfred/Spotlight.  This is most easily seen in case of app launchers, but happens for other apps too. Can this behavior be somehow corrected?  <comment329542> Have you updated Alfred to the latest version? Is Alfred supported by macOS Sierra? <comment329553> The same thing happens when using Spotlight. <comment329571> Have you disabled/removed Alfred to see if it is causing the problem? <comment329574> @IconDaemon Did you even tried to observe what I described? It's not system related, it works this way on every mac, whether you observe it depends on how fast your system is and how big application you try to quit. btw. It's the same thing with opening <comment329593> I don't really understand your complaint about my comment. Trying this myself, when the app _is still closing_, Spotlight does indeed appear and disappear rapidly. It may be you just have to wait a fraction of a second longer than you want to before trying to invoke Alfred or Spotlight. <comment329596> That's the point - I don't want to wait that fraction of a second.
