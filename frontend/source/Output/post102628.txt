I have deleted a bunch of music from iTunes on my Macbook Pro, but am not gaining any free space <body> I am trying to clear off a lot of extra space on my hard drive. I started with about 90 gigs of music today when I had about 45 gigs of space left available. I just deleted almost 40 gigs worth of music from iTunes and emptied the trash. But it doesn't show any increase in available space.   I have been using the codedf -H/code terminal command to look at disk usage. This is the result:  precodeFilesystem                          Size   Used  Avail Capacity    iused    ifree %iused  Mounted on /dev/disk0s2                        249G   195G    54G    79%   47650435 13189307   78%   / devfs                               188k   188k     0B   100%        636        0  100%   /dev map -hosts                            0B     0B     0B   100%          0        0  100%   /net map auto_home                         0B     0B     0B   100%          0        0  100%   /home localhost:/klncoWvMIai4qlXuHftSwz   249G   249G     0B   100%          0        0  100%   /Volumes/MobileBackups /dev/disk1                          3.3G   3.3G     0B   100% 18446744073707931462  1621231 1712789607586623232%   /Volumes/GSP1RMCPRXFRER_EN_DVD /code/pre  I have also verified my disk, repaired it, and repaired permissions. Nothing is changing though.  <answer102847> I fixed the problem by resetting the PRAM and the NVRAM.  <comment120846> How exactly did you delete music "from iTunes"? Also: on what disk (screenshot) is your music library? <comment121071> I deleted it from the disk. By deleting from iTunes, I meant just deleting music files. <comment121185> I do not see how this makes sense. <comment121234> Neither do I, but it worked. Maybe that in conjunction with repairing the disc and verifying it. <comment134206> Often problems can fix themselves given time.  In this case, shutting down probably helped greatly.
