My Mac would turn on but it would get stuck on the white screen upon startup after chime <body> My Mac turns on but it gets stuck on the white screen upon startup after the chime. I have OS X 10.7.5  I have tried many things unsuccessfully like:  kbdCommand/kbdkbdR/kbd: Boot to OS X Recovery Mode = The window does not pop out.  kbdOption/kbd: Access Mac Startup Manager = When I choose the Recovery disk, again it goes to white screen.  kbdOption/kbd: Access Mac Startup Manager = Again it goes to white screen.  I reset kbdCommand/kbdkbdOption/kbdkbdP/kbdkbdR/kbd: Reset PRAM = with no luck  I reset SMC, disconnected the battery cable and held the button for 5 seconds = No luck  Used kbdCommand/kbdkbdS/kbd: Single User Mode = Type codefsck â€“fy/code and press kbdReturn/kbd  I typed  code/sbin/mount -uw //code:  precodehfs: Removed 2 orphaned  / unlined files and 0 directories /code/pre  I tried:  precodetouch /private/var/db/.AppleSetupDone exit /code/pre  = This didn't work either  When I connected in Target Mode T via Thunderbolt cable to another Mac = I was able to scan entire disk drive and fixed any errors on disk = but now still unsuccessful with boot up.  When I was in Verbose Mode I noticed the following line:  precodeSMC: :smcInitHelper ERROR: MMIO regMap == NULL - fall back to old SMC mode  BootCacheControl: Unable to open /var/db/BootCaches.playlist: 2 no such file or directory  /code/pre  Do you have any recommendations what I should try next?  <answer232240> Wow, it looks like you did almost everything already. What I have left for you are reinstalling your OS X and Reset PRAM.  <answer273364> Hold Command + Option + R during boot. It will go to Internet Recovery mode, it will download original Mac OS X that came with your Macbook and allows you to remove your partitions using Disk Utility and install a new Mac OS X on it.  <comment283876> Yes I did PRAM = command-option-p-r with no luck either :( <comment283880> How would I reinstall OS X since when I am in Alt/Option    Access Mac Startup Manager =  My window gets stuck on the white screen and does not move ? Do you think would it be good to format drive through Target Disk Mode and then to try install using USB Stick with installation files ?  Any ideas? Thanks
