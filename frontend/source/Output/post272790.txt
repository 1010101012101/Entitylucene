How does pairing work between iOS and Fabriq speaker? What protocol or API? <body> I recently bought a Fabriq speaker (https://www.thefabriq.com).  However, the set-up process felt strange... you download an iOS app, switch on the speaker, enter your wifi password on the iOS app, and then the speaker is magically able to connect to your wifi network.  My question is, on a technical level, how is this possible? The speaker wasn't paired over Bluetooth, there was no WPS set-up or anything like that, and the iOS app didn't ask for any extra permissions (that I recall).  So how could the app send the wifi credentials emto/em the speaker for this initial set-up process? How are they communicating?  Edit: There's an alternative set-up in the manual that involves connecting to the speaker's own WiFi network for the set-up. However, during the normal automatic set-up, the speaker doesn't require any user intervention ... so is the app somehow connecting to its own WiFI network behind the scenes?  More generally, is there an API for this / is an app capable of connecting to arbitrary wifi networks without user permission? Seems like this might be a security risk if so ...
