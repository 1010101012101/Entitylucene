How to Repeatedly capture fixed screen region to sequence of images <body> I need to repeatedly capture a fixed region from each of a sequence of web pages to a series of images that I can then compile to a PDF. Ideally I could just navigate from page to page and press a hot key to capture the area and save the image to an automatically incremented filename each time.   What I want to stop doing is manually defining the region each time (it's irritating and when I drag to create the region it's even more irritating to try to get the exact pixel dimensions correct), which seems to be the only option with Skitch and others I have tried.  What software will allow me to do this most efficiently?  <answer167273> Have you considered batch cropping the screenshots? For example, using Imagemagick (which you can install via homebrew: codebrew install imagemagick/code):  precodecp original.png test.png #backup original! mogrify -crop 800x600+100+200 +repage test.png /code/pre  where code800x600/code is the size of the region, and code+100+200/code the X/Y offset. This can be applied to several images at once by simply specifying several filenames. strongNote that this will modify your images (in-place)/strong, so operate on copies.  <answer167299> You can use codescreencapture/code commandline utility. Create an strongAutomator Service/strong (takes no input) which will do a shell command and assign keyboard shortcut to it.   The shell script will look like this:  precode/usr/sbin/screencapture -R0,0,1000,400 /path/to/save/FileName$(date +"%m_%d_%Y_%H_%M_%S_%s").png /code/pre  codescreencapture/code has code-R/code modifier not listed in codeman/code but it's listed in help as:  precode-R&lt;x,y,w,h&gt; capture screen rect /code/pre  The values I used above captured this image which also shows how the rect coordinates worked.  Change codex,y,w,h/code values for those You need.  The codedate +"%m_%d_%Y_%H_%M_%S_%s"/code adds a timestamp to the file name  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ErqUC.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  You can actually use Screencapture to find the rect you want by using kbdcmd/kbd +kbdshift/kbd+kbd4/kbd  which will give you some cross hairs with the numbers on for click drag release capture rect.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tlHiX.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  In Terminal.app  typing: code/usr/sbin/screencapture -h/code  will give you the help documentation  precodeusage: screencapture [-icMPmwsWxSCUtoa] [files]   -c         force screen capture to go to the clipboard   -C         capture the cursor as well as the screen. only in non-interactive modes   -d         display errors to the user graphically   -i         capture screen interactively, by selection or window                control key - causes screen shot to go to clipboard                space key   - toggle between mouse selection and                              window selection modes                escape key  - cancels interactive screen shot   -m         only capture the main monitor, undefined if -i is set   -M         screen capture output will go to a new Mail message   -o         in window capture mode, do not capture the shadow of the window   -P         screen capture output will open in Preview   -s         only allow mouse selection mode   -S         in window capture mode, capture the screen not the window   -t&lt;format&gt; image format to create, default is png (other options include pdf, jpg, tiff and other formats)   -T&lt;seconds&gt; Take the picture after a delay of &lt;seconds&gt;, default is 5   -w         only allow window selection mode   -W         start interaction in window selection mode   -x         do not play sounds   -a         do not include windows attached to selected windows   -r         do not add dpi meta data to image   -l&lt;windowid&gt; capture this windowsid   -R&lt;x,y,w,h&gt; capture screen rect   files   where to save the screen capture, 1 file per screen /code/pre  <comment196184> Thank you so much. I had no idea that there *was* a command-line screencapture command! I'll use this with Keyboard Maestro and...done! <comment196185> I can only mark one answer as "the" answer, but this is a useful approach I never even though of (and will make use of in the future. I even use ImageMagick for other tasks...). Thank you!
