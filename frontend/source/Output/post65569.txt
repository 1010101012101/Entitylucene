I cannot connect to iTunes and the App Store from my iPad in iOS6 <body> I just updated to iOS6 yesterday. After the update, I cannot connect to the App Store and iTunes on my iPad.  There are no options to click when I'm prompted by this message em"Cannot connect to iTunes/App Store"/em.  What should I do?  <answer69351> I would suggest taking a look at this:  http://support.apple.com/kb/TS1398  And if that doesn't work, try this (under Troubleshooting on an iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch):  http://support.apple.com/kb/TS1368  <comment77270> Reboot your device to start. <comment77273> Are Apple properties the only thing you cannot access? [apple.com](http://apple.com)? Any other websites? Do apps that rely on network activity (Netflix?) function?
