View passwords of all Wi-Fi networks my Mac has connected to in the past <body> I have connected my Mac to lots of public Wi-Fi networks. I want to know their passwords. What should be the strongterminal command/strong to list all the Wi-Fi networks whom I connected with in the past with their passwords.   <answer150299> Open strongKeychain Access/strong from /Applications/Utilities and search for strongAirPort/strong. All the network passwords are listed as 'AirPort network password' entries. Double-click an entry, then select strongShow Password/strong and enter your login password to view it.  <comment176919> thanks thats the graphical way, found other way to do it via terminal: cd /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport <comment182732> â†’ Stack: could you develop the method you found, and make an answer of it?
