Removing the taskbar transparency in uBar <body> Is there any way to remove the taskbar transparency in uBar? (i.e. set the transparency to 0%, i.e. 100% opaque)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/afSG1.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer164348> The version 2.3.8 that came out the day after you asked this implemented a Custom theme in Preferences that allows you to have 100% opacity.
