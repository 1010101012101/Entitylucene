MacBook unibody 2010 will not charge reliably <body> I have a 2010 MacBook unibody (the white one, not the Pro) and I have been having all sorts of trouble with it. While I have most of the other problems figured out, there is one that keep persisting and I've tried everything I can think of (or find) to fix it:   ul lithe MacBook will not charge reliably. /li /ul  It will charge for about a week, then it quits working and dies and I can't use it for a few days. Everything I know/tried is listed below.  strongWhat I Know:/strong  ul lithe MagSafe charger seems to work for a few days, then stop working for a few days/li liit only seems to stop working when my MacBook's battery dips below 30%/li lionce it stops working, I can not get it to work again unless I unplug it from the wall and the MacBook and let it sit for over 24 hours/li lithe MagSafe charger is emimmaculate/em. No dirt anywhere on the charger or the port/li lithe MacBook discharges even when the adapter is connected/li lithe light on the charger is off when it does not work (even when connected)/li liall pins are making proper contact with the MacBook/li lithere is current going through the cable and into the MacBook. /li /ul  strongWhat I Have Tried:/strong  ul licleaning the charger and port/li liusing different wall adapters/li liusing different outlets/li liresetting the SMC and the NVRAM/li liwarming up the charger./li /ul  Unfortunately I don't have access to another first generation MagSafe MacBook or MagSafe charger so I have not been able to find out which part is broken: the MacBook or the charger.   Taking it to the Apple Store is not something I am willing to do, so I'd prefer a solution that does not involve me leaving my house.  Thanks.  <answer195264> Unfortunately you've tried everything... If there is enough power left to boot you could go to the Apple Menu  About this Mac  System Report  Power  AC Charger Information and have a look if it recognises the charger, and check the battery health.  If this isn't an option because the battery is flat, or health is good and the charger isn't recognised. Then sadly you are going to have to leave the house.  <comment233101> Thanks for the reply! I just got it to start charging again and it does recognize the charger as well as the wattage, and it reports the battery health as "normal". I figure its probably time to buy a new charger :/ <comment233104> Who down votes a answer like this? <comment233109> I thought it was a solid answer (Thanks btw). I'd upvote it but my account is too new. <comment233110> People are strange.
