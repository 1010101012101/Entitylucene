Problem loading iPhone on voltage converter (12 V <-> 230 V) <body> A few days ago I had a very strange problem. First, the iPhone 4S was attached to a car radio and it was loading an hour long, but the battery charge level only increased by one percent! It was hot out there but if it gets too hot the iPhone should shut down.  Then I loaded my iPhone with the power supply attached to a voltage converter. I saw the battery charge increasing and some time later the iPhone was completely shut down.  So I tried it the next day on the voltage converter but it doesn't powered on. After a few days I was back at home and here I tried to load the iPhone as usual. The iPhone displayed me low battery and after some hours it was turned on and completely loaded. Now it does work as expected, but I don't understand what was happening and why did it happen.  Has anyone a clue what I should do the next time?  <comment233770> I could imagine that the load of the charger is too low for the converter and it doesn't actually work. <comment233772> Hmmm good point. A product (smartphone) from a competitor did work. I also tried to load at different times but it never worked. Could it be that the iPhone needs more power (Voltage/Ampere) than the other? <comment233774> I had a similar issue once. The iPhone selects a current based on the remaining battery load. when it is almost empty this can be around 1A (newer iPhones at least). when it is almost full, it decreases to around 200mA. <comment233775> The only thing which is strange then is that the iPhone wasn't empty. It had about 30%. Perhaps it never loaded and instead it dropped until it was completely empty. Thanks for your thoughts. <comment233776> get a cigarette lighter usb plug for a few dollars ;) <comment233843> My iPhone used to complain that the radio would work to play, but not to charge. Works fine on an older iPod classic, so that's what I keep in there now. Used to use a 12~240v inverter successfully to charge everything [though they make the screen 'buzz' & mess up the touch whilst charging], but now I just use those 2 buck 12v 'cigar lighter' adapters with 2 USB sockets. No issues.
