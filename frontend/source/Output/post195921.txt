File Sharing section in itunes is missing <body> I remember that there was a feature in iTunes that allows to show, add and delete data from every single app on a synced apple device (iPhone or iPad) from the PC. I wanted to do it today but the file sharing section in apps is not showing. Why?  <comment233908> Itunes synced and backed up the data but the file sharing section still isn't showing. <comment233913> Sure you're in the correct section, scrolled down? That's usually the issue. Sure there's at least one app capable of doing this? <comment233916> I scrolled down. Nothing is there. Only the apps section. <comment233918> I checked on both Mac & PC, iTunes 12.2.1 - it's there on both. Maybe reinstall, i don't really know how it could be missing.
