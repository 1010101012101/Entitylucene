How to import icloud library .xml file in iTunes <body> I have just one .xml file which was exported from my old iTunes. When I import this file I see all the songs appear but the are greyed out(unable to play).  I tried turn off/on iCloud Music library but with no result.  <comment341328> Same computer as the export? if not, did you also copy the actual music across, & is the relative location identical? <comment341334> ah, forget that - I missed 'iCloud'. I've no experience with that, I keep all mine locally.
