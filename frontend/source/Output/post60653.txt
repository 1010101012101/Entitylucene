How to do fresh install of Mountain Lion? <body> My Mac is very slow.    My Mac is running OS X Mountain Lion after an upgrade from Lion.    How can I do a fresh install the OSX Mountain Lion, with a clean HDD (all of my documents deleted), so it feels like a new MacBook?  <answer60654> ol liBack up your data./li liBoot into the Recovery System by holding kbd⌘/kbd+kbdR/kbd during early boot./li liSelect Disk Utility and format your drive where OS X and your files were stored on./li liQuit Disk Utility and select "Install Mountain Lion"./li /ol  <answer60660> You should make a boot disk first, then you can boot from it and install.  h1Make a boot disk/h1  Before we start you should get your hands on a usb drive with at least 8 gigs of space that you're happy to wipe clean.  ol liFirst off you'll need to redownload the Mountain Lion app from the app store, unfortunately it disappears after you install/li liRight click on “Install Mac OS X Mountain Lion.app” and choose the option to “Show Package Contents.”/li liInside the Contents folder that appears you will find a SharedSupport folder and inside the SharedSupport folder you will find the “InstallESD.dmg.” This is the Mountain Lion boot disc image you are looking for./li liCopy “InstallESD.dmg” to another folder like the Desktop. /li liPlug in your USB drive of at least 8 gigs and Launch Disk Utility from the Utilities folder in your apps./li liSelect the drive in the left hand pane and click on the "erase" tab Set the format to MAC OS Journaled and give it a name like Mountain Lion OSX or something you'll remember.

For Mountain Lion , you need 8 GB RAM. Other thing, I would like to suggest you to clean your Mac, remove all system junks from your Mac and gain more free spaces. Still, if your Mac is slow then do fresh installation.  <comment69814> is there any official documentation for this at apple.com ? <comment69824> You don't have to make a bootable install disk first. But it's not a bad idea. <comment69834> [OS X: About OS X Recovery](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4718) <comment69850> After you've reinstalled ML, please report here on whether your machine feels faster. (BTW, what Mac is it?) <comment69859> Check your hardware too. Your hard disk may be failing. <comment69861> Wouldn't this redownload Mountain Lion from Apple's server? If he has the image he could burn the image to a DVD or thumb drive first so it's quicker. <comment69867> Yes, it would, but: The installer deletes itself after updating. So he has to download it anyway. <comment70016> @lhf i use macbook 13" earlier 2011 <comment71898> You don't HAVE to, but I find it's way faster that way. Redownloading the installer from recovery is super-pokey. <comment84075> Thank you for a really good explanation. +1 <comment98473> No, you need 2 gb of ram. And 8gb of free space to install Mountain Lion. http://www.apple.com/osx/specs/ <comment98630> Thanks, i forgot the erase part so Lion didn't recognize my drive. +1
