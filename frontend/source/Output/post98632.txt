What is the file type, what is your Widows version iPad version, on what laptop, anything you tried so far, does the file in question shows o the laptop. <comment115856> @Buschar Hi! iPad model A1430, MD407LL/A. iOS 6.1.2. (I hope...in Settings/General under 'Version'. <comment115859> @Buschar ...apology. Windows 7 Professional, Toshiba Portege R830-17C. File type I have no idea, the others I did manage to download are .MOV. Many thanks for your help. <comment115889> Now lets see...sometimes that happens when the file is in USE. You should have gotten an error message, but who knows. Make sure the file is not in use, copy protected or locked, maybe turn off - on your ipad. Try moving the file with in your ipad from one folder to another.
