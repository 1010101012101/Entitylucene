Can't click links at all in certain circumstances <body> This problem has bothered me for a few months now, but only in very limited circumstances. When I went on medium.com and tried to access my profile, when I clicked to open the navigation, the box dropped down for less than a second before disappearing.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PZYBS.gif" alt="enter image description here"  Even worse, the menu doesn't even appear at all every click. It's about every other click, but I don't think exactly. Double clicking has mixed results, but none too promising. I tried in Safari with the same results.  The even more annoying thing is that in Chrome, I can't left-click on any extensions to access their menus, at all.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/m0pxW.gif" alt="enter image description here"  And I'm not 100% sure if this is related, but I've also been having issues installing certain applications, including Wireshark and TrueCrypt 7.2  When I opened the installer, I get two instances of the installer, each of which stall and never finish the initial file verification process (before I can even start the installer).   <comment297784> Does this only happen with chrome? Does safari have to same issue? <comment297796> How odd. Does this also happen if you boot into safe mode? <comment297946> @IronCraftMan I have the same issue with Safari <comment297947> @JMY1000 I didn't think of that, actually. Just tried though and booting into safe mode does solve the problem of clicking it, but then I run into different weird display issues <comment297956> Try booting into Apple Hardware Test / Apple Diagnostics and see if you're having GPU issues.
