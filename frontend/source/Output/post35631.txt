What is the shortcut for fullscreen mode in Lion? <body> Some apps allow their windows to be viewed in full screen, such as Google Chrome, which is really good.   Wondering if there is a shortcut to do it?   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fA3cI.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer35634> kbdctrl/kbd+kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbdF/kbd works for Safari and Chrome.  The strong^/strong is old unix style for kbdctrl/kbd, which is why the option in the menu is:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rWu7P.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongEdit:/strong  While the answer above only works for both Safari and Chrome, the following shortcut works only for Chrome and Firefox:   kbd&#x21E7;/kbd+kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbdF/kbd  <comment40631> Rant: iTunes uses âŒ˜f, so it's now impossibly hard to access the search/filter box with the keyboard only. Argh! <comment40632> Not Rant: A caret (^) is the symbol for Control, old unix users represent copy/paste as ^c ^v. Aside from the incorrect capital F (IMO), that screenshot indicates 'Control+Command+f', and your answer indicates the same combination. <comment40637> Ah, something new to remember! Still, it is somewhat unintuitive for the average user. BTW: You can access the iTunes search box via ALT+CMD+F.
