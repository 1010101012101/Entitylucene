All editing and sharing options disabled in Quicktime <body> I downloaded a video with these specs:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eMUFW.png" alt="enter image description here"  I'm unable to cut, copy, paste, trim and share since all these options are greyed out:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/W6t5h.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QgWxM.png" alt="enter image description here"  Why?  <comment284204> Paid (pro) edition vs free version? <comment284332> Free version, but all these features are usually enabled and working. Re-encoded the video with Handbrake and now it works: question still standing though.
