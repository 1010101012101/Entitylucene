How to pinpoint cause of disk I/O errors <body> I am getting (seemingly random) disk I/O errors on my bootdrive. At first I thought it was caused by a faulty hard drive, but now I've replaced it and I still get those errors.  These are the steps I have followed beginning from the first time I noticed something was wrong:  ol liLaptop hangs with just Google Chrome and Postbox (an e-mail application)/li liI restart the laptop, but it never gets past the screen with the grey apple./li liStarted Apple Hardware Test by holding "D" during startup. This came up with no errors/li liThrough Verbose mode, and Disk Utility of the install CD I saw that it had disk I/O errors./li liI switched the Momentus XT drive for the stock Apple HDD./li liInstalled a fresh copy of Snow Leopard/li liRecovered everything from a Time Machine backup/li /ol  After a day it started giving disk I/O errors again in Console. This makes me think that an app or a setting is causing this as it is unlikely that both the hard drives are corrupted.    How can I pinpoint which application is the cause?  Below are my system details:  precodeMacBook Pro 5,3 2.66 Ghz / 8GB RAM Snow Leopard 10.6.8 First HDD: Seagate Momentus XT 500GB Second HDD: Stock Apple Hitachi 320GB /code/pre  <answer79035> I've had my MacBook Pro repaired. They changed the SATA cable, and everything is working again.  <comment89427> If you are not equipped like a repair shop with ample spares and ability to isolate failures by systematically testing each component in the chain, I would re-seat the cables (or the drive if you are not comfortable getting to the cable interface to the logic board). IO errors are almost always a failing drive so swapping that drive once the error rate (or loss of time or data) outweighs the cost of the time and parts to repair that drive. <comment89480> If it's not the harddrive it can very likely be the the internal SATA cable the drive is connected with. <comment89482> @MacLemon Is there a way to test this with my current setup? I am now running Snow Leopard from the Momentus XT in an external enclosure through Firewire. No problems (yet). <comment89483> Replace the cable for a known-good cable and see if the problem goes away. If you don't have any troubles with the same disk in an external enclosure my bet stays on the SATA cable.
