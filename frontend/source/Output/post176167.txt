What is SiLabsUSBDriver.kext? <body> What is SiLabsUSBDriver.kext? Is this part of the official Yosemite system and if so, how do you know? Where can someone go to find this out from Apple directly? Thanks.  <answer176169> It's the kernel extension for the Silicon Labs USB to Serial driver.  It is not a part of OS X Yosemite as it's not included in the Install OS X Yosemite.app bundle.  <comment207940> So... NOT part of Yosemite, then...? <comment207942> No it's not and I edited my answer to reflect that fact.  Also the USB2Serial dongle may just have the Silicon Labs chipset and was installed by another product named dongle using that brand chipset. <comment207959> Yeah, I think it came from a Garmin GPS install.
