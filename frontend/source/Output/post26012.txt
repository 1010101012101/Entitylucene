FaceTime Failed: Person Not Available <body> Consider an iPad 2 using WiFi attepting to make FaceTime calls to users on an iPhone 4. Each contact has their phone number defined under the iPhone tag (as opposed to Mobile).   Whenever attempting a FaceTime connection, FaceTime attempts to connect, and fails with the error:     FaceTime failed - 'Person' is not available for FaceTime.   Measures attempted:  ul liclose FaceTime from running apps./li lidisable &amp; re-enable FaceTime from Settings./li liconfirmed the device's WiFi is active &amp; enabled./li /ul  I've seen the 'solution' of "reset all settings", but suspect that's overkill, and likely won't work, as reported by lots of other users.  How can this error be avoided?  <answer26015> strongAccording to Apple, some of the symptoms are:/strong  ul liWhen you are calling someone on FaceTime, the number on their screen is not your number./li liPeople are unable to initiate a FaceTime call with you. /li liAfter installing a new carrier settings update, FaceTime does not activate./li /ul  strongHow to fix:/strong  ul liIn Settings  Phone, turn FaceTime OFF and turn it back ON again/li liGo to Settings  General  Reset  Reset all settings/li liDone/li /ul  <answer38200> Also be sure that BOTH devices are on wifi, not just the iPad.  <comment29623> Are you saying that the iPhone user has everything configured appropriately, but Facetime calls do not reach them? <comment29664> http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4246 <comment104541> Did you ever try the opposite way? have them call you !
