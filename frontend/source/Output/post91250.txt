Start XQuartz automatically on X11 app launch <body> Before switcthing to Mac OSX 10.8 everytime I launch application which uses x11 it was starting x11 automatically.  After switching to XQuartz and 10.8 it does not work anymore and I have to launch XQuartz manually.   How to launch XQuartz on demand?  <answer96244> I don't have to launch xQuartz, I just use Terminal and ssh -Y user@IP.  Then X emulation appears to be available as I can launch X windows from the server.  <answer99732> I was having the same problem. Quitting XQuartz and deleting ~/.Xauthority resolved the issue for me.  I got the idea to do this from the Mountain Lion, Xquartz, and (lost) autostart thread in the Apple Mailing List. Other suggestions from that thread include:  ul liLogging out and then back in after installing XQuartz./li liEnsuring that the $DISPLAY variable is being set by by launchd and not clobbered by your shell scripts (see http://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/wiki/X11-UsersFAQ#sshXforwardingdebugging)/li /ul  <comment107337> Do you set DISPLAY in `.bashrc`/`.profile`/`.bash_profile` or the like? Check it by starting Terminal.app and typing `echo $DISPLAY`. <comment107573> No, I don't set it.
