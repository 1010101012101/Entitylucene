How to change the color and format of the static host/path/user string in the Terminal or iTerm? <body> Example:  precodecookie:~ j$ date Sun Aug  5 02:14:29 CEST 2012 cookie:~ j$ /code/pre  Just as it's pasted here, all three lines are of the same color. I would like to have "codecookie:~ j$/code" or at least part of the string be of a different color than the rest.  I know that I can specifically enable color coding for specific applications like codels/code or codegit/code, but I haven't found anything like this.  Is there a way to change the coloring and format of the static host/path/user string in the Terminal or iTerm?  <answer59508> Check out this page for instructions on how to do this http://www.macosxtips.co.uk/index_files/customising-the-terminal.php  <answer59517> What you are looking for us customizing the prompt in the bash shell.
