Contacts.app command line interface <body> Is there a CLI front-end to the Contacts.app (formerly Address Book.app) database?  Example:  precodemycontacts --email '*@google.com' # to get Googlers /code/pre  <answer72656> Contacts still has AppleScript support. You can see documentation for the supported properties and commands by opening its dictionary in AppleScript Editor.  codeosascript -e 'tell app "Contacts" to properties of people where vcard contains "@gmail.com"'/code  I didn't find a way to check the actual email fields using a single specifier.  precodeset l to {} tell application "Contacts"     repeat with p in people         repeat with e in (get value of emails of p)             if contents of e ends with "@gmail.com" then set end of l to name of p         end repeat     end repeat end tell l /code/pre  <answer123398> The closest thing to a generic solution is Shane Celis's codecontacts/code command available at http://gnufoo.org/contacts/.  This is also available as a package in homebrew, which can be installed with: code$ brew install contacts/code  There are other options that may also work for you.  Contacts just stores info in a sqlite database so you can access it with the sqlite command.  You could create a custom script to accomplish a particular task if you want.  Scott Stevenson had a tool called abtool up that was popular for a while, but it appears to be a dead link now.  You might also try searching through some of the stuff on GitHub.  In particular, since Shane Celis's app appears unmaintained (while still functioning well), there are some who are building replacements.  <comment84355> Thanks, upvoting because it's a solution to the actual query I requested but it isn't a generic solution so I won't accept just yet.
