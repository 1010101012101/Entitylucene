iPad Maps can't fetch directions? <body> Macbook Pro (MBP) and GPS iPad side by side but on different WiFi routers.  Maps app open on both.  MBP takes less than two seconds to display route.  On iPad, the end points have apparently been handed off to the iPad (they are the first choice on the list).  But ten minutes later, the iPad is still "loading."  strongWhat might cause this?/strong  Other internet functions seem to be OK.  I want to be able (when off WiFi) to see where I am on the route.  I've done it before with this device.  This school has four WiFi SSIDs, and I use two of them.  I changed the iPad from B to A and the MBP from A to B to see whether it was some sort of port blocking.  Nope, MBP still gets route instantly and iPad never.  But now it's even weirder: iPad instantly shows the location of the destination if I don't ask for a route.  But AFTER that, tap "directions," and the route comes up instantly.
