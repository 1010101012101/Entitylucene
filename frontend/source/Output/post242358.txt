How can I change Finder's sidebar icons in OS X El Capitan? <body> Without using a 3rd-party application, how do I go about changing the icon in the sidebar for the Developer folder? When I click on "Get Info" for this icon it's showing the icon does have the hammer icon but it's not showing in El Capitan in the sidebar when I add it over there?  Does anyone have a solution or can refer me to an article that will provide me with some direct information on how to add/edit this?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7WjgC.png" width="379"  <answer283741> I found a SIMBL plugin that changes the icons on the sidebar to custom ones. By removing the icons from the configuration file, it doesn't replace any icons with custom ones, but only allows the icon of the folder itself to be displayed on the sidebar. Keep in mind that this will also change your home folder, All My Files folder and all other folders to display in colour.  Download modified version here  Remember to use mySIMBL for the plugin to fully work: mySIMBL download  strongDisclaimer:/strong The original plugin is made by W0lfschild and is open source. I do not own this file, I have only provided a version with pre-edited config files. Original version is on GitHub (github.com/w0lfschild/colorfulSidebar_9)  <answer284344> Only items you can activate from Finder  Preferences  Sidebar have custom sidebar icons. If you manually add folders, such as the Developer folder, to your sidebar favorites, they will show up with a generic sidebar icon, even if the folder has a custom Finder icon.  The only way to change this would be with hacks as described by e.g. Keyboard_Gamer's answer.  <comment298100> I believe they're all generic icons, unfortunately - have a look at `/System/Library/CoreServices/CoreTypes.bundle/Contents/Resources`, all the sidebar icons are there <comment298104> Related: https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/76897/change-mac-os-x-finder-sidebar-icons https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/187767/change-mac-os-x-sidebar-icons <comment298134> @perhapsmaybeharry I can see the Developer icon is in the folder there and it's still not showing up in my Sidebar :-( <comment298137> @Danijel-JamesW the icon you see is the generic "Finder" folder icon, named `DeveloperFolderIcon.icns`. However, sidebar icons are named `Sidebar*.icns` and are monochromatic. I'm not sure if it's possible to add/edit a sidebar icon without affecting all other sidebar icons.
