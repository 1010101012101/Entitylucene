Navigate to a certain tab and close that tab in OSX Terminal <body> I've got multiple terminal tabs open, and I want to be able to close the current tab. How can I make the current terminal tab be the active tab, so that I can close that tab with kbd⌘/kbd+kbdw/kbd?  I am in the default Mac terminal.  <answer96657> If you're trying to do it in a script, you might use something like this:  precodetell application "Terminal"     repeat with w in (get windows)         repeat with t in (get tabs of w)             if processes of t contains "man" then                 set selected of t to true                 set index of w to 1             end if             --properties of t         end repeat     end repeat end tell tell application "System Events" to tell process "Terminal"     perform action "AXRaise" of window 1     tell menu 3 of menu bar 1         if enabled of menu item "Close Tab" then             click menu item "Close Tab"         else             click menu item "Close Window"         end if     end tell end tell /code/pre  Tab objects don't have a codeclose/code command. codeset index to 1/code doesn't actually raise a window, but it makes it it appear as window 1 to System Events, which supports the AXRaise action.  <answer137304> In OSX Terminal, hold down the keys kbd⌘/kbd+kbdShift/kbd while arrowing right or left. This will allow you to switch between active tabs.  When on the tab you wish to close, as you noted, kbd⌘/kbd+kbdw/kbd will close that tab.
