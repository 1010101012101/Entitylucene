iPhone 5 problem, "No Service" and not being recognised by iTunes <body> I've recently purchased a second hand iPhone 5. They demonstrated the phone making calls before I purchased it.  Unfortunately the phone strongisn't being recognised by iTunes/strong, emand/em is also very frequently showing me the message strong"No service"/strong. I did however very briefly have service earlier today, enough to send and receive a couple of SMS's.  The things I have tried are:  ul liRestarting laptop,/li liTrying another laptop,/li liUninstalling and reinstalling iTunes (on both laptops),/li li"Reset Network Settings,/li liRebooting phone,/li liAirplane mode on / off,/li li4G on / off,/li liUpdating all software,/li liTrying to turn off automatic carrier selection, but I get the message "Unable to load network list",/li li"Reset All Settings",/li liTrying many mixes of restarting with cables in and out and every different USB port available to me,/li liOffering my lunch to the gods./li /ul  The software involved is:  ul liiTunes 12.1.50/li liiOS 8.1.2 /li liOS X 10.10.2/li /ul  I've also checked and the phone is definitely unlocked, and marked as last activated yesterday when I first tried to use it.  I would be greatly appreciative of any further suggestions.  <comment206273> Did you try with another SIM card? Probably won't help with the iTunes issue, but the "no service" error might just be a buggy SIM card. <comment206277> After seeing some comments here: http://www.reddit.com/r/applehelp/comments/21wjdz/itunes_will_not_recognise_iphone/ I tried this: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201263 and this appears to have solved the connection problem. Still got "No Service" issues. Will try a new SIM tonight. Thanks!
