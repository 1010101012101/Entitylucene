Cannot drag and drop files from the Dock folders <body> On the Dock I have two folders, Documents and Downloads.  I was used to drag files from the Downloads folder and drop them on the Desktop or somewhere else.  Now I can't do it anymore. I'm only able to drag and drop files from the Dock folder to the Trash.  How can I fix it?  <answer72635> Relaunching the finder fixed the problem.
