Why does the webcam of my MacBook Air (11", mid 2011) does not work? <body> I do not know when it did not work, but I guess it was when I installed El Capitan. Actually it is at version 10.11.6 and every App (Skype or Facetime) tells me that there is no webcam connected.  But my system says different: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6HBtQ.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/W5XtB.png" alt="enter image description here"  I read very old threads at Apple Help Site, but I doubt that these OS incompatibility problems do not fit to my problem.  It might be related to this question. But there is no answer.  <comment311145> Does it work in Quicktime or PhotoBooth etc? <comment311154> Well - now I just check it again and my webcam is working. It's like in the linked post.
