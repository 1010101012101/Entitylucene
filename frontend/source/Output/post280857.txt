How to reset Spotlight cache/index? <body> I uninstalled Parallels Desktop, so I don't have a Windows VM any more. However when I type codewe/code into Spotlight, the Windows Weather app comes first, and if I press it, it says Parallels Desktop is not installed anymore.  How do I clean the cache or re-build the index?  (I am not sure what this operation is called)?  strongNOTE/strong: I would like to avoid having to use codesudo/code.  <answer280860> To see where an item in Spotlight is located, press ⌘↩︎ (cmd-return) to reveal the item in Finder. That error isn't something I'd expect if the item had actually been removed.  You can reindex your disk by adding the disk to System Preferences → Spotlight → Privacy (which will delete the index), then removing it from the list.  ul lihttps://support.apple.com/kb/HT201716/li /ul  <answer280922> Usually it's not necessary to rebuild the Spotlight database to get rid of Windows applications of a deleted Windows VM in the Spotlight results.  To properly remove all traces of a deleted Windows VM with some kind of integration in macOS - like a VM specific Application menu - remove the links of the Windows apps in $HOME/Library/Parallels/Application Menus/ and/or $HOME/Applications (Parallels)/.  To remove Parallels Desktop completely from your Mac remove the following files and folders besides the main app in /Applications:  ul li$HOME/Library/Preferences/com.parallels.*/li li$HOME/Library/Parallels/li li$HOME/Applications (Parallels)//li li$HOME/Documents/Virtual Machines (or something similar - please check that it doesn't contain VMs of other type2 hypervisors like VMware)/li li/usr/local/bin/prl* (possible soft links to Parallels command line tools in the app bundle)/li /ul  <comment353268> Already checked $HOME/Library/Parallels/Application Menus/  and $HOME/Applications (Parallels)/ for links to (now deleted) Win apps? <comment353389> This was the issue. I tried looking for a complete guide on how to uninstall completely parallel but couldn't find one that goes after the "drag n drop Parallels from Application to the Trash"
