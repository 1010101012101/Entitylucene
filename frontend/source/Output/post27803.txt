Wifi stops working on Macbook Pro (Lion) <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   Internet stops working frequently on OS X Lion       Just bought Macbook pro 2011 running on Lion. I connect to my WiFi, but it has started happening frequently that internet stops working even though my DSL modem and wifi router are ON and working perfectly, as I acess it via my phone also. But on mac, no internet. To fix it either I need to restart the machine or turn wifi OFF and then ON.  Is this issue common on OS Lion?  any solutions?  Thanks  <comment31858> I believe this has been fixed by the latest updates. Also, repeat question - this is/was a common issue with Lion. <comment31863> How to update it?
