Notes on iOS 7 crashing on Startup <body> After upgrading to iOS 7 the standard Notes app crashes when starting it.  I'm running iOS 7.0 and have reproduced this after a clean power down of the phone.  <answer102901> Took me a while to figure this out so I'll share it if it helps someone else:  ul liInstead of tapping on the Notes icon, search for a specific note in spotlight then open that note./li /ul  After that Notes will work normally again.  (Apple knows about the bug but they didn't fix it in time for the release.)  <answer105843> You could also open Siri and tell Siri  Note hello  I would note "hello" for you click on it and it opens notes and it would work like normall  <comment124442> Also a clever way to bypass the default view when starting notes.
