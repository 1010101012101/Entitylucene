Using Launchbar to make Popclip appear <body> strongPopClip/strong is a Mac app that adds the iOS functionality of a bunch of options showing up above selected text. PopClip automatically appears every time I select text, and that's annoying, so I want to trigger it from the keyboard instead. I'm trying to set up strongLaunchbar/strong to launch an Applescript to cause PopClip to appear next to selected text.   The Applescript I'm using is codetell application "PopClip" to appear/code. However, when I press ↩ with the text selected in Mail and "Show Pop Clip.scpt" selected in Launchbar, nothing happens. And when I press ⇥ as Obdev (the Launchbar developer) recommends here, I don't see an option to "Run" as they suggest.   How can I use Launchbar to make Popclip appear?  <answer181201> With Launchbar you can run scripts in the background by pressing Option+Return, rather than just Return. This works for me, whereas Return by itself did not.
