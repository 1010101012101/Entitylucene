Is it possible to change the gray color scheme of Lion? <body> Seems to be too much gray in Lion.  Status bar, title bar, scroll bars, links bar, tabs, everything blends into itself.  I am guessing that is part of the design. Any options to changes these?  <answer48349> There doesn't seem to be an awful lot you can do, but as a start, you could get the colored iTunes icons or Finder sidebar icons back like they used to be in Snow Leopard.  <answer48367> You can make a subtle change away from gray shifting towards blue with theOS preferences. Go to Apple Menu - System Preferences...  Then click on General in the upper left  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gJBZw.png" alt="enter image description here"  And then select Blue under appearance  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xHoUM.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer48617> It's possible to mod the color scheme but it involves changing resource files and is not for the faint of heart.
