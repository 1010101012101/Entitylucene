How do I select a file or directory inside a package? <body> When an application pops up the Mac OS X standard file or directory chooser dialog it won't allow me to open packages so that I can select something within.  Is there a way to do this without creating a symbolic link to the target?  For a specific example: I've installed Komodo Edit &amp; the Python SDK for Google App Engine.  In Komodo's Language  Python preferences I can add Python import directories to help with syntax checking or debugging.  The GAE libraries are in code/Applications/GoogleAppEngineLauncher.app/Contents/Resources/GoogleAppEngine-default.bundle/Contents/Resources/google_appengine/code but I can't navigate there using the directory chooser.  (I'm not asking how to browse the contents of a package from the Finder or command line.)  <answer769> From the dialog, use kbdCommand/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbdG/kbd. This will open a small 'Go to folder' dialog where you can type (or paste) the path that you want including paths within packages.  <answer770> You can use the Finder to navigate inside the bundle, and then drag and drop the file to the 'Open file' dialog/sheet.  See a more visual explanation here.  <comment677> Typing worked but pasting didn't - so I think Carmine's answer is better, though it's good to know about this anyway. <comment678> Thanks for the tag Am1rr3zA; I wanted to add 'package' but it's new, as am I... <comment1340> Great answer.  I'm using this all the time now, this used to frustrate the hell out of me.
