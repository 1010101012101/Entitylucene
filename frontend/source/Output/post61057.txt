Warning message when trying to change Standby mode settings <body> I tried changing the Standby mode settings using the command codesudo pmset -a standbydelay 5400/code . I set it to 5400 so that it is delayed to 1.5 hours compared to 70 minutes as default.  However, I get the following message right after I changed it :  codeWarning: Idle sleep timings for "Battery Power" may not behave as expected. - Disk sleep should be non-zero whenever system sleep is non-zero./code  What does this mean ?? Must I change the value back to 4200 ?  emedit/em  precodeActive Profiles: Battery Power       -1* AC Power        -1 Currently in use:  standbydelay         5400  standby              1  halfdim              1  hibernatefile        /var/vm/sleepimage  darkwakes            0  gpuswitch            2  disksleep            0  sleep                180  hibernatemode        3  ttyskeepawake        1  displaysleep         5  acwake               0  lidwake              1 /code/pre  <answer61065> Based on the output of codepmset -g/code, you have your system set to sleep after 2 hours, but the disk sleep timer is set to zero--meaning never according to the codepmset/code man page. To correct the error, set codedisksleep/code to a value greater than zero but less than (or equal to) codesleep/code.    Use something like the following with your preferred codedisksleep/code time,  precodepmset -a disksleep 45 /code/pre  to set codedisksleep/code to 45 minutes for all power situations.  You may want to adjust these times for when your MBPr is running on battery.  Set battery profiles with code-b/code instead of code-a/code.    I think you'll benefit greatly from the codepmset/code man page. It's very clear and You'll probably discover something else that pertains to your needs there.   <comment70397> Could you post the output of `pmset -g`? <comment70411> Hmm Disk Sleep is related to the option `Put hard disks to sleep when possible` .. However I disabled that because I have SSD instead of HDD, so I do not really need that option (according to sources I read online) .. Does the warning message indicate that a severe problem might appear later on ? <comment70414> I know what you mean. It doesn't appear to make sense, but apparently you can't have the system sleep without the disks sleeping ? <comment70415> This is just to work around your error based on what `pmset` expects. <comment70441> Hmm yeah, interesting. I read the `pmset man page`, thanks for the link. What would happen if I ignored the warning message ? <comment70481> Since you have an SSD, I think it's safe to ignore.  This option is infinitely more important for HDDs.
