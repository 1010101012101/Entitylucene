How can I switch dialog buttons using the keyboard? <body> Whenever I'm trying to close a file that has been changed, I get the save file dialog  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tsjeG.png" alt="save file dialog"  I remember that the emDon't Save/em button used to have focus, so I could press it using Spacebar, while pressing Enter would click on emSave/em. But now on Lion, I'm unable to find a way to press the emDon't Save/em using keyboard only, since kbdTab/kbd doesn't change focus to anything, and space doesn't work either.  This is the same for all file save dialogs in the system.br strongIs there any way I can press the emDon't Save/em button using keyboard only?/strong  <answer38017> Go to...   ol listrongSystem Preferences&#x2192;Keyboard&#x2192;Keyboard Shortcuts/strong/li liand select strongAll controls/strong under strongFull Keyboard Access/strong  ul liNow you can use kbd&#x21E5;/kbd (tab) to switch between the dialog boxes./li listrongNote/strong: Unlike in Windows, you need to hit kbdspace/kbd to trigger a highlighted box that is not the default one! (If this is not natural to you, here's something that helps many to remember tab and space rather than just enter. The space bar is the keyboard version of a one button mouse with the tab moving the mouse's pointer for you.)/li /ul/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YVBVZ.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment43066> Awesome thanks! <comment69542> Unfortunately, this no longer works as of Mountain Lion (OS 10.8.0). Does anyone have an update? <comment75452> @TrevorBurnham It works for me on OSX 10.8.1. <comment75858> @TrevorBurnham You have to hit **space** if you want to trigger a selected button that is not the default one. <comment75885> You can also select them with ⌘⌫, or ⌘D in some applications. <comment75977> I'm no longer experiencing the problem I reported above. Must have been fixed in 10.8.1. <comment118615> oh THANK YOU... been searching for this :)
