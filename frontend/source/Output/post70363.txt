How do I force a "Waiting" file to upload to iCloud? <body> In this question, I learned that the "dotted-line cloud" icon in OS X's iCloud file view means "Waiting to upload". While writing a document in Byword today, I saved it and found it had been marked with this icon - there were several other documents, months old, that still had the "Waiting" icon as well.  Is there any way to, if not force, emgently encourage/em these files to upload to iCloud?  <answer70364> I was concerned I'd have to save these documents to my local filesystem, delete them from iCloud, and then perhaps save them to iCloud over again, but it turned out that simply re-opening the "Waiting" documents, making a trivial change to them (such as deleting a character and then adding it in again), and then saving the file caused them to be synced successfully.  <answer122577> I ran into a similar problem but every time I tried to open the file, the hosting application (Keynote in this case) hung. I was able to codekillall -9 ubd/code to unwedge iCloud.  <answer150282> The way I fixed it was to drag one document over another, which automatically creates a folder (like in iOS). Then, I dragged them back out from the folder, and the status waiting status was gone.  <answer186152> The way I fixed “waiting” was to drag one document over another while holding down “option” key.  <answer224531> ol li2-finger-click the song./li liSelect "Add song to iCloud music library"./li /ol  <comment272330> How does this help to upload stuck files into iCloud? <comment272413> We're looking for long answers that provide some explanation and context. Don't just give a one-line answer; explain why your answer is right, ideally with citations. Answers that don't include explanations may be removed. <comment373792> The **gently encourage** part is so Apple :) I was wondering if there would be a better solution now in 2017. But apparently not.
