Can't generate a Reflow project from photoshop CC <body> According to this video importing a psd from strongPhotoshop CC/strong to strongReflow/strong is as simple as going to the menu strongemFile  Generate/em/strong and clic strongemEdge Reflow Project/em/strong.   But this menu item is not showing in my case.  I'm using a Mac OSX 10.8.5, the 30 days trial of creative cloud for the moment with both strongReflow/strong and strongPhotoshop CC/strong installed and up to date. I also have Photoshop CS6 installed on my Mac.  <answer131820> In the case of exporting Edge Reflow projects, if you are not able to see a menu option for:  ul liFile /li liGenerate /li liEdge Reflow Project/li /ul  Please check that you have the folder:      &lt; install directory  /Adobe Photoshop CC/Plug-ins/Generator/reflow.generate    If you do not have this directory, uninstall and reinstall Edge Reflow.   The Edge Reflow installer should automatically install the plug-in for you.
