Best practice to maintain high charge count <body> I have a MacBook Pro, always plugged, I put it to sleep during the night. Is  that the best thing to do if I want to maintain a high number of remaining charges, while also keeping a healthy battery?   Or should I turn it off at night instead of sleep, plug it off, or something else?  <answer190347> apple has a useful page with some tips on how to keep your battery healthy right here: Apple battery tips They also recommend discharging the battery about once a month. I don't think sleeping instead of powering off makes that much of a difference.  <comment225989> You should read what [Apple says about maximizing battery performance](https://www.apple.com/batteries/maximizing-performance/#macbook).
