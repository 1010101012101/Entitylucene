MacOS Extended (Journaled, Encrypted) uses h/w encryption? <body> I have a LaCie 2big, connected via Thunderbolt 2.  When I select as a disk-partition strongMacOS Extended (Journaled, Encrypted)/strong, does that uses some type of hardware encryption or is it all software?  <answer136243> Using this option, you'll endup with a whole disk encryption.   It uses OSX CoreStorage volume management technology and XTS-AES 128-bit encryption, so it's software.   hr  Edit : As pointed Alan Shutko, since 2011 Intel added an Intruction set to intel processor to do AES encryption.    <comment161565> Unless you have a suitably recent Intel Core processor with built-in AES, in which case the AES will be done that way. In any case, it is never done by hardware in the drive. <comment161698> What are you trying to figure out in the end? In one sense all encryption is hardware since code runs on a CPU and everything is software since without programming or direction a digital computer does nothing.
