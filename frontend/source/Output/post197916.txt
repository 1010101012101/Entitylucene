Can't create/adjust/delete a partition <body> So I wanted to create a new partition to test the new El Capitan operating system. But I'm unable to create a new partition, the '+' sign is greyed out.  This is what I have currently configured for my drive: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qgZ5Y.png" alt="enter image description here"  Now I've googled this problem and found similar cases but they all mentioned that it's because the 'Revertible' setting was configured 'No'.  Now in my case this is configured 'Yes (no decryption required)' as shown below:  precodeCoreStorage logical volume groups (1 found) | +-- Logical Volume Group 9EDF35D5-3B14-4F68-8A1A-98151AB82671     =========================================================     Name:         Mac     Status:       Online     Size:         179371204608 B (179.4 GB)     Free Space:   18882560 B (18.9 MB)     |     +-&lt; Physical Volume 3DB04CA6-AF59-4FF4-9D01-E5D9C5418933     |   ----------------------------------------------------     |   Index:    0     |   Disk:     disk0s2     |   Status:   Online     |   Size:     179371204608 B (179.4 GB)     |     +-&gt; Logical Volume Family 721050CD-09E2-4002-A065-8C724204B12C         ----------------------------------------------------------         Encryption Status:       Unlocked         Encryption Type:         None         Conversion Status:       NoConversion         Conversion Direction:    -none-         Has Encrypted Extents:   No         Fully Secure:            No         Passphrase Required:     No         |         +-&gt; Logical Volume C51A83AC-321D-4B5F-A5D7-7713F8B36874             ---------------------------------------------------             Disk:                  disk1             Status:                Online             Size (Total):          179000000512 B (179.0 GB)             Conversion Progress:   -none-             Revertible:            Yes (no decryption required)             LV Name:               Mac             Volume Name:           Mac             Content Hint:          Apple_HFS /code/pre  <answer198146> I was able to fix it by getting the UUID for my disk and then run the following command:  precodecorestorage revert UUID /code/pre  You can get the UUID for your corestorage disk by passing codecorestorage list/code and then you will get something like this codeLogical Volume C51A83AC-321D-4B5F-A5D7-7713F8B36874/code. The part behind 'Logical Volume' is your UUID.
