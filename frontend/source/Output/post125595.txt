Change of default behaviour when connecting to external display: mirror mode <body> Some OS generations back the default behavior when a new display was attached was that the screen was mirrored.   I would like to get this behavior back since without it I have to fiddle with the system settings every time I want to give a presentation, since the projector I am connecting with is new to the OS and I have to set up everything.  So question: Is there a plist or something that I can change once and for all?  <answer125615> Just press kbdâŒ˜/kbd + kbdF1/kbd after connecting the display to your Mac and your screen will mirror.  ps. you might have to press kbdfn/kbd as well. This depends on how you've set up your F-keys.  <comment147052> Thanks! This is great! But having a plist setting would save even pressing these two keys.
