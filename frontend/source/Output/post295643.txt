Can I print lists from the Reminders app? <body> I would like to print out the lists and tasks that I maintain in the strongReminders/strong app.   I can copy the text or take screenshots and paste them to a program like Word, but… Is there an easier approach?  <answer295694> You can achieve this using AppleScript on your Mac. Press kbd⌘ cmd/kbd kbdspace/kbd and enter codeScript Editor/code. Create a new script with the following code in it:  precodeset _body to "" tell application "Reminders"     set AppleScript's text item delimiters to "\n"     set _body to (name of reminders in list "Tasks" whose completed is false) as string end tell  set _output to "Macintosh HD:Users:YourName:Desktop:List.txt" try     set _reference to open for access file _output with write permission     write _body to _reference     close access _reference on error     try         close access file _output     end try end try /code/pre  Replace codeTasks/code with the name of the list you want to print, codeMacintosh HD/code with the name of your startup drive, and codeYourName/code with your username.  This will place a file named codeList.txt/code on your desktop with all those reminders ready to print.
