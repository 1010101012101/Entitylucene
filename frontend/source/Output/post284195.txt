Chrome randomly opens window with a audio tab muted. Seems like I have a virus <body> Recently my chrome has been acting weird. All of the sudden it's been opening a bunch of windows/tabs that has a muted audio tab in it. I can't seem to track down which application/plugin is causing it. Does anyone have any tips how to isolate which one is causing it so I can track down which one is causing it or better yet a fix for it? I've been searching for a while and can't seem to find any solution.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Oe8ZA.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment358367> Try scanning your computer with [Malwarebytes](https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/237486879d36363118852c55ae510d0cb14053da56e790c2cd6d572a6355682e.gif), a free mal- and ad-ware removal tool. _Disclaimer:_ I'm only a satisfied user of Malwarebytes, which has disinfected many computers in my client base. <comment358370> Thanks for recommending @IconDaemon.
