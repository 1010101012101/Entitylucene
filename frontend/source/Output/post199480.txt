Yosemite file permissions/ownership issue <body> I'm no stranger to OSX and a while back I upgraded to Yosemite at rollout.  I'm a web developer an I'm encountering a strange behaviour with file permissions ever since upgrading. For example, I'm using the command line to pull in files through Git or Composer. Previously, when I did this, I was automatically the owner of these new folders and files and had read/write access.  However, when I perform the same operations, I'm no longer the owner and have to go about codechown/code and codechmod/codeing various folders in order to get going.  I haven't heard of anyone else experiencing this. Any ideas?  Chris  <answer199795> I found the solution which was much more localised.  I needed to codechown -R/code my composer directory. For some reason, I wasn't the owner. After running this command, the issue was resolved.   <comment240167> Out of interest, who owns the the files when you pull, what permissions are they and what do you expect them to be? <comment240341> I'm not sure who owns the files. They are publicly available in repositories hosted on Github etc. <comment240347> sorry, I meant when you pull and the file isn't owned by you, who *is* it owned by? When you pull a new file what is the output of `ls -l file`? And what do you expect it to be?
