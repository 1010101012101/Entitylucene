Audio Input not working on 13-inch Macbook Pro Mid 2012 <body> I am trying to connect an audio device (analog synthesizer) to the input of my 13-inch Mid-2012 Macbook Pro running OS X Mavericks 10.9.3. The synthesizer's output is a standard 1/8th inch stereo plug. According to http://support.apple.com/kb/ht3625, I should be able to switch this from System Preferences. However, my screen looks like this even when my device is plugged in:  img src="https://s14.postimg.org/crn0dvr0h/Screen_Shot_2014_07_03_at_6_29_49_PM.png" alt="Screenshot"  There is no option to use the audio jack as an input.  How do I connect my device to the audio input?  <answer136980> From the technical specification:  precodeAudio  Stereo speakers with subwoofer Omnidirectional microphone Headphone port Support for Apple iPhone headset with remote and microphone Support for audio line out (digital/analog) /code/pre  There is no direct "microphone in" or "line in" connector. The only way to connect a microphone is to use a splitter meant for iPhone and similar devices, like this one. You should note that the input is mono only, no stereo support.  <answer136989> You missed the first sentence:     Plug the input audio device into the combination audio port using the   strongproper adapter cable/strong.   You can not use your "standard" stereo plug, use Apple specific plug.
