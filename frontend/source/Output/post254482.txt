Apple Mail: no search results after Sierra update <body> After a Sierra update, Apple Mail is not searching anymore, and Spotlight provides incomplete results - it does not provide a top lists e.g. searching for "Excel" does not show Excel or it does not provide results in Mail.  What should I do now?  <answer254484> I would start with the procedure described in Rebuild the Spotlight index on your Mac:     ol   liChoose Apple  menu  System Preferences, then click Spotlight./li   liClick the Privacy tab./li   liDrag the folder or disk that you want to index again to the list of locations that Spotlight is prevented from searching. Click OK to   confirm./li   liSelect the folder or disk you just added, then click the Remove (–) button to remove it from the list./li   liQuit System Preferences. Spotlight will reindex the contents of the folder or disk./li   /ol
