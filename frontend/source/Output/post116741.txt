iPhone with broken home button is stuck on black screen after jailbreaking <body> I have an iPhone 3Gs and recently noticed that the home button doesn't work anymore. I used AssistiveTouch.  Now I want to jailbreak my iPhone, but it's gone wrong: the device is stuck on a black screen after jailbreaking, iTunes doesn't recognise my iPhone and my home button doesn't work.  What can I do?  <answer116774> If you can't restore the device to factory settings after connecting it to iTunes, I'm afraid the best you can do is take it to a authorized Apple service center and get it fixed.   <answer116868> Let the iphone discharge. Then connect it to your computer. If iTunes recognize it, try to restore it.  <answer194438> I would reccomend a vist to authorised apple service centre.Better leave it to the professionals.  <comment231902> Welcome to Ask Different!

I searched it on Google and found a program called RecBoot, but it shoeldn't work on 64 bit computers, and i have one... Do you think it's gonna work if i run a 32 bit version of windows in virtual machine and then try recboot? Thanks!
