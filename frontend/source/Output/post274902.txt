Do "Click to Tweet" and "Click to Post" still exist? <body> Mountain Lion had "Click to Tweet" and "Click to Post" buttons in Notification Center if you had Twitter and Facebook configured in System PreferencesInternet Accounts. However, I can't find them. I'm using El Capitan. Did Apple remove this feature? I can't find anything on the Internet saying so.  <answer274913> You have to add the widget. Open Notification Center, choose Edit, then drag the Social widget.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dCpW6.png" alt="Notification Center Social widget"  (The Twitter widget in the screenshot is from the Twitter app and shows tweets. That's not what you want. You don't need Twitter installed for this — Social is a system widget.)  If Twitter/Facebook doesn't show in the Social widget, make sure the Share Menu option is enabled for the account in System Preferences → Internet Accounts.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LOPS3.png" alt="System Preferences → Internet Accounts"  <comment345742> Aha! They moved it! Thanks.
