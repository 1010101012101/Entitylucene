ReportPanic on OS X Yosemite 10.10.2 <body> I run OS X Yosemite 10.10.2 on a first generation 27" iMac. Over night the computer apparently crashed.  All applications I had open had gotten all jumbled in the restart so I pressed the codeF3/code to see every thing and saw the following pop-up message:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WdybS.png" alt="enter image description here"  I've seen these kind of messages before, but I had never seen them labeled as "ReportPanic".  Can someone explain what this is and what it means?  The label gives me pause.  Is this a real OS X message or a possible hack?  <answer174815> ReportPanic is the name of the application that saves your data and handles crashing. It is a normal OS X application.  <comment205935> That sets my mind at ease.  Thanks for the quick reply. <comment205936> @Jagra Just to confirm, you were in Mission Control when you took that picture, right? <comment205956> just click on the "Report" and you will see if it is real or not. If you wish us to help you publish some 50 lines here. <comment206041> Yes, in Mission Control
