Visualizing Data on a Mac? (MySQL db is source) <body> I'm having difficulty finding a promising OS X app for connecting to and visualizing data which resides in a MySQL database; it seems like there are various options for Windows, but not so much for Apple?  I'm hoping however that there are some gems that I just haven't discovered yet  I would like to be able to publish these charts to the web; I have heard of people using Excel for this, but I don't own Excel for Mac and I'm not sure if the same abilities are present in the Mac version of it  <answer118827> OpenOffice and derivatives like LibreOffice and NeoOffice can connect to a MySQL DB using ODBC; and, once the connection is established, the spreadsheet component can use it as a data source.  <answer118828> There is R, with gui Rstudio, or tableau, but as @bmike says, depends on what exactly you want to do.  <answer118853> You can go for Navicat for MySQL/Premium (Mac) and Sequel Pro. They can help you to connect and visualise your data.  ul lihttp://www.sequelpro.com/li lihttp://www.navicat.com/products/navicat-premium/li /ul  <answer123781> You can try out Ubiq. It is a web based data visualization tool for MySQL. It supports MySQL database on Mac.  <comment138557> What package does what you need on windows? Since office 365 if free for a month and you can try it out quite readily. Also, unix based plotting is rich, free and well documented. Have a look at [posts like this](http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2013/12/simple-plotting-from-the-command-line/) and packages like [mathplotlib](http://matplotlib.org).
