Set up a password policy that has a maximum failed login attempts and a reset after a certain period of time <body> I tried using pwpolicy to set this up.  I was able to set up maxFailedLoginAttempts, but setting minutesUntilFailedLoginReset doesn't seem to do anything.  When I query pwpolicy using:  precode pwpolicy -n /Local/Default -getglobalpolicy /code/pre  I keep seeing that minutesUntilFailedLoginReset=0 even though I just set it to 60.  I even tried changing this for one user, and it claims it was changed but when I query the user's policy or the effective policy nothing has changed.  <answer2496> I’m assuming that you’re aware that pwpolicy doesn’t affect Admin accounts (tho it may show you otherwise, leading to believe that it does).   I also asume that you’re running the commands as sudo or at least have tried.  Other than that, I haven’t tried that value myself. As a side (and curious) note the minutesUntilFailedLoginReset is strongnot/strong in the manpage for pwpolicy.   precodeman pwpolicy /code/pre  <comment2185> Post the commands you’re using to set the pwpolicy please. Thanks. <comment2425> I used a standard account (not an admin) for my tests.  I ran the commands using sudo.  It is weird that minutesUntilFailedLoginReset isn't in man.  Thanks. <comment2462> I couldn’t find other reference to it in the OS X documentation, I think you might be out of luck. Leave the question open to see if somebody comes in the future with a better idea. Good luck!
