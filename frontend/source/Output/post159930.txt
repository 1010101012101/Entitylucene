How do I zip a .app file using terminal? <body> I'm having trouble zipping a code.app/code file. If I zip without code-r/code (recursive) it is really shallow, if I zip with code-r/code it's really dense. The zip doesn't unzip correctly regardless.   <answer159931> From the man page for codeditto/code:  precodeditto -c -k --sequesterRsrc --keepParent src_directory archive.zip /code/pre  <comment188013> This still isn't preserving codesigning, although it does answer the question. :/ <comment188018> @ThomasReggi, I just tried it with code signing and it worked for me.  Is there something unusual about your app like a non-Mach-o executable? <comment188019> Not sure what that is I just signed and got `signed bundle with Mach-O thin`. I'm signing with this command `codesign --verbose --deep --force --sign "Company, LLC." Atom.app` I'm lost and can use any help, when I verify I get `nested code is modified or invalid` <comment188032> I figured it out with this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20266954/codesign-deep-on-mavericks-xcode-5-0-5a1412
