Tried to hide a dock icon but failed <body> I tried to hide an app's icon on the dock but the app (Clock) could not be launched.  I googled and found some solutions to dock icon hiding.  I modified the app's Info.plist by adding the following two lines:   precode&lt;key&gt;LSUIElement&lt;/key&gt; &lt;string&gt;1&lt;/string&gt; /code/pre  I also tried this:  precode&lt;key&gt;LSUIElement&lt;/key&gt; &lt;true/&gt; /code/pre  But, it didn't work. The app couldn't be launched. The pop-up window says:     Clock quit unexpectedly.br   Click Reopen to open the application again. Click Report to see more detailed information and send a report to Apple.   The app is "Clock" (like the desktop gadget in Win7) that I downloaded from App Store. http://clock.projectworld.net/  I am wondering whether this app can be modified as an agent or not.  <answer158517> I suspect that the Clock application is code-signed, which is likely what is causing the crash.  I tried to do the same LSUIElement change in the plist file to Clock.app and it gave the same crash.  Some research told me the following:     There's one more step to the process if the developer has signed the application with an Apple Developer Certificate â€” and that includes all Mac App Store applications. Without this step, you'll likely get a crash when opening the app. To prevent this, you'll need to re-sign the application using the following command in the Terminal:      sudo codesign -f -s - /path_to_app/appname.app      Replace "/path_to_app/appname.app" with the path and the application name that you just tweaked the Info.plist for. After doing this, press enter, and enter your password. The application will be re-codesigned and you should be able to launch the app without any issues.   source: http://www.maclife.com/article/columns/easy_mac_hacks_run_os_x_applications_without_their_dock_icon  I have downloaded Clock.app, Added the LSUIElement key to the plist file, and I resigned the application, and it seems to have had the desired result you are looking for.  There are some considerations though, the only way I could close the app without a dock icon was to use Activity Monitor and kill the process.  The link I pasted above also gives a few more warnings you should read before doing this.  Make a backup, try it out, and let me know if you have the same success I did?  <comment186332> Can You show us part of the report about what crashed? <comment186373> After I modified the app's Info.plist, the app was simply unable to be launched. And a small window popped up saying "Clock quit unexpectedly. Click Reopen to open the application again. Click Report to see more detailed information and send a report to Apple." No matter how I tried, the app could not be launched. I could not restore the original Info.plist. <comment186375> Although I don't know what "re-sign" really means, I followed the suggestion given. And it worked. Really amazing. But I wonder how long the "re-sign" can last. Is it one-time only? or I have to re-sign the app every time I try to launch it? Thanks for your help.
