Uninstalling MacPorts <body> I have installed homebrew so I want to uninstall MacPorts. Here, I read I should enter  precodesudo port -fp uninstall installed /code/pre  in Terminal.app. But I got the following error:     Error: No ports matched the given expression when used sudo port -fp   uninstall installed   What might be the reasons? are there others ways to uninstall Macports?  <comment323017> What output do you get for `port list installed` <comment323100> @root I get the following `-bash: port: command not found` <comment323202> Sounds like its already uninstalled then. <comment323408> @root and how can I verify something isn't installed? (equivalent to ask "how can I verify if something is installed). Thanks! <comment323797> Considering the 'port' command is no longer found that is pretty much confirmation that it is no longer installed. <comment326481> Do you still have an /opt/local directory ? That's where MacPorts is installed. You can also check the following directories:   ls \         /opt/local \         /Applications/DarwinPorts \         /Applications/MacPorts \         /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.macports.* \         /Library/Receipts/DarwinPorts*.pkg \         /Library/Receipts/MacPorts*.pkg \         /Library/StartupItems/DarwinPortsStartup \         /Library/Tcl/darwinports1.0 \         /Library/Tcl/macports1.0 \         ~/.macports
