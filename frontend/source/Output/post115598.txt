How to set an iTerm2 startup command <body> How do I set a command on a profile so that when I start a new terminal window, it fires off that command.  Specifically, I'd like to be able to set my virtualenv with:  precodeworkon ENV /code/pre  So that it starts automatically into my virtual environment when that I use that profile.  <answer115870> Got it, there is an option added in the development branch of iTerm that adds a "Send text at start" option to the profile settings. This will eventually be added to a (more) stable version of iTerm.  <answer136655> In iTerm2, preferencesprofilestab codegeneral/code, there is an option in codeCommand/code called codesend text at start/code that executes any command you put there after login.  In particular, I typically have  precodesource ~/.virtualenvs/.../bin/activate /code/pre  for profiles that use Python.  <comment169894> How to run multiple commands one after another in same profile tab? <comment257192> Can't seem to execute multiple commands either using iTerm2 - attempting to 'make configure', and then 'make service'. Any ideas appreciated! <comment257445> You can separate commands with a `;` and that will allow multiple commands on one line.  In this example `make configure; make service` should work.
