Trouble accessing ntfs drives in mac os x <body> I installed tuxera-ntfs in mac os x and am able to mount my external disks and use them without any issues.  I can delete files, copy files to my external disk and from my disk  But I am not able to cut the files(use the cmd+X) . Any files that I copied from my external disk to my mac, I face the same issue.  Also I am not able to change user permission by using codechmod/code for any of the files.  I have two disks and the behaviour is the same in both of them  I want to know if this is a default behavior of using ntfs drives in mac or I am missing something.  <answer175247> i use this i have not problems http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/26288/ntfs you can try !   <comment206462> Welcome to Ask Different!

Any knowledge of this weird thing that i am encountering. <comment206499> I answered the first part over in SU. idk on the 2nd part, sorry. Not even sure how NTFS & what is essentially a nix command are going to get along. Did you try Get Info & see what is available there for perms? <comment206507> maybe - http://www.tuxera.com/community/ntfs-3g-advanced/ownership-and-permissions/ <comment206572> While this link may answer the question, it is better to include the essential parts of the answer here and provide the link for reference.
