Uncaught exception raised in open directory client-side plugin <body> When I attempt to change the open directory settings for 10.6 server using ServerAdmin I get the following error.  This prevents me from making any changes to any open directory settings for the system.  Does anybody have any ideas on how to solve the issue?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/m53hm.png" alt="Example error message"  <answer131282> It seems difficult to believe that it is as you suspect, that something that a client did has locked you out of control of your own server.  Check permissions! Break out the Terminal and attempt to discover where the critical configuration files are for Open Directory, and make sure your permissions ( codels -l/code ) haven't been "bonked" &lt;-- (sorry for the inscrutable admin rhetioric ;-)  Also, if you find the config file(s) in question, you will be able to examine and edit manually ( codesudo cat ____/code and codesudo vi ____/code). If these files are in an xml binary form, they can be converted with codeplutil -convert xml1 config.plist/code and converted back with codepluitil -convert binary1 config.plist/code -- as always, copy the orginals somewhere else, back them up, and work with copies to experiment, so you can always restore them necessary.  hr  also you can attempt to use the codeserveradmin/code (&lt;---that's hotlinked) command line tool to attempt what the GUI is preventing you from doing. here is another good reasource, as well as here  hr  It is difficult to diagnose/troubleshoot this without having access to the machine, so I hope I give you ideas to try that may lead to new paths to a solution. Again, let me know in comments if this answer is not helpful, and I will again delete to prevent noise. Good luck!  <comment153553> Can you be a bit more specific as to what you are trying to change in your OD? Is the OD a master or replica? When did the issue start occuring? Maybe restart the server temporarily in save mode and see if the plug-in error remains. <comment153860> It doesn't appear to matter what I change.  Any of the OpenDirectory settings appear to trigger this issue, but I first became aware of it specifically when I was attempting to change the LDAP SSL certificate.  The OD server is a master with no replication server configured.
