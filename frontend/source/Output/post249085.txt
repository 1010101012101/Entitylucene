How can I make phone calls on the internet IPhone 6 <body> I have a remote location were I have only satellite service, no cell service.  When I first purchased my iPhone 6 to my surprise I received messages (voice) left on phone at this location. I couldn't call people back but could text them over the internet.   Now after returning to the remote location I can not get any more messages left on my phone from voicemail. I am still getting text messages, which I also did with my iPhone 4S.   Did an update wipe out this ability or have I turned something off by mistake? I have all of my data turned on to WiFi.  <answer249088> Sounds like you want to enable Wifi Calling on your device. Turn on Wi-Fi calling in codeSettings &gt; Phone &gt; Wi-Fi Calling/code. For more, check out the Apple page on Wifi Calling.  <answer249095> If you want a cross-platform solution (in case you don't want to become more tied down to iOS), there are numerous VOIP solutions. With Skype, for example, you can purchase a phone number for a pretty reasonable price. (Or just use Skype-to-Skype for free.) I know you didn't ask for a cross-platform solution, but you didn't rule it out either - and either way, this could solve your problem.
