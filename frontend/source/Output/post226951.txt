Why Retina screenshots are twice as large as chosen area? <body> This is a known issue, but I do not understand why the screenshot taken on emmy/em retina-MBP always has doubled size as compared to area chosen for screenshot:  If I choose 100x100 (as OS shows - of what? pixels? - on "get info" they do not provide, only shows "dimensions") area I get 200x200 which upon scaling becomes more blurry than original picture.  My questions:  ol liDo all retina users always get these doubled screenshots?/li liHow can I take a screenshot of the same size as the area I choose? /li /ol  I found a lot of "resizing" solutions, but is there a way to take a screenshot with "original size" without resizing the resultant screenshot?  <answer226953> ol liYes - that's the way it's coded/engineered/li liNo - you'll need to post process the images using a tool that's designed to automate this or use Automator to make a service to resample the images./li /ol  I like Skitch and Napkin for processing retina images, but there are many others.  <comment275609> thanks for the answer, could you please comment about "additional issue" I added to the question - it is very important for me, because I feel I cannot work effectively on Retina. <comment275610> Let's revert that edit and ask a separate question with just that pixelmatr issue, @Ilan . We strongly prefer one question per question but since yours were a bit easy - I tried for letting both run the first time. You can click on the edit link and see the text to copy/paste and then tag/edit the new question... <comment275612> If you believe this is a separate issue and the question will not be marked as duplicate I will be glad to ask another Q. <comment275617> Go for it @Ilan - you're asking how to use pixelmator - not at all what this post is covering :-)
