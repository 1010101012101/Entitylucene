Paste text with AppleScript without simulating cmd-v with System Events <body> I would like to be able to use AppleScript to paste the clipboard's text into the foreground application. Every solution I can find online uses codetell app "System Events" to keystroke "v" using command down/code. However, I am running this script with a keyboard shortcut, so I may already be holding down keys when this command fires, which makes the paste fail because more keys are pressed than just codecmd/code and codev/code. I know that I can use codedelay/code to give myself time to release the keys, but that feels like a hack (and ideally the paste would be instantaneous).  Is there a way to use AppleScript to paste without simulating the shortcut cmd-v? Thanks.  Edit: Also, if there is a way to use AppleScript to copy selected text without simulating cmd-c, that would be much appreciated as well.  <answer237161> I managed to find the following solution.  precodetell application "System Events" to tell process (name of current application)     tell menu bar item "Edit" of menu bar 1         click menu item "Paste" of menu 1     end tell end tell  delay 0.1 /code/pre  The delay is there to give the system time to copy before using the clipboard.  <comment290322> Is using clipboard okay or does it need to be without clipboard? <comment290324> A solution without the clipboard (like setting a variable to a string and then printing it) is also fine.
