Can OS X automate creating a reminders from a page in a web browser? <body> I enjoy the feature of creating reminders from a web page with one click. similar to how Omnifocus does this.   Can Apple's Reminders do the same by apple scripting or other addition/short cut?    <answer79122> If you want to add a selected text as a reminder   ul liOpen Automator /li liCreate a new service /li liService receives selected strongtext/strong in strongany application/strong/li liAdd a strongRun ApplScript/strong Action /li liAdd the following script/li liSave it/li /ul  the script :   precodeon run {input, parameters}      tell application "Reminders"         set theReminder to (make new reminder with properties {name:input})         activate     end tell      return input end run /code/pre  Now when selecting text, you can with a right clic add it as a reminder. If you want that only in Safari. Replace the strongany application/strong with strongSafari/strong at the top of the Automator window.   And if you don't want to show the Application Reminders when adding a new one, just remove the line  strongactivate/strong in the script.   <comment91450> Nice idea, but please do some editing on the last sentence. What do you mean by "shop the App Reminders"? <comment91452> 's/shop/show' done.
