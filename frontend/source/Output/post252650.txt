How to reset the iPad without PC and iTunes <body> I have an iPad and I forgot the passcode. I can't remember email ID or Apple ID.  Now I only have the iPad and bill. Many stories I've read suggest to reset the iPad and then login.  How do I do that?  I don't need the data so it's ok to wipe it out.  <answer256613> The iPad has been unlocked with help of Apple Support. :)  Thanks everyone.  <comment314366> i don't need old data. <comment314383> Open iforgot.apple.com from there you'll be able to recover your password. <comment314396> In iforgot.apple.com asking mail ID or apple ID. I forget both. I don't know which mail id i used. <comment314397> How can you forget your e-mail address? <comment314400> that is two years back, i used more than two email address.now i formatted my iPad and i can't remember my old email address which i given. <comment372214> How did you unlock it?
