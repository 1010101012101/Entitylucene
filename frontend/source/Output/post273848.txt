Is there a way to undo tap to focus? <body> When I use the inbuilt camera app, my finger sometimes accidentally touches the viewfinder somewhere, and it focuses and meters there. I want to undo the tap to focus, so that it focuses on wherever it thinks is appropriate, which is where it was focusing before my finger touched it.  I may not have noticed where it focused. If I did, I could have tapped that area to focus there. But since I don't remember, how do I reset the focus?  The solution I came up with is killing the camera app and reopening it, but is there a better one?
