macOS Sierra kernel_task high CPU and memory usage for main user <body> I tried everything that comes up in the Apple forums, such as booting in the Safe Mode, Disk Utility's First Aid, closing all the apps and paying close attention to Console app and System Monitor to find out the culprit, restarting several times, finishing up any system updates (I had an Xcode update in queue) etc. None above helped.   One thing I did notice is, as I setup a new Admin user and started logging in as that user, the codekernel_task/code simply didn't even show up in the Activity Monitor, and the symptoms seemed to disappear. While it seems like kernel_task is an issue in the OS space (even kernel space) rather than a user space problem, switching to a new user seems to help. However, I do not want to switch to the new user, considering it is quite inconvenient to also migrate all the program's configurations/caches etc.  So any idea what is causing this and how to solve this? Seems a bit irrelevant but the hardware seems all right and an almost new MacBook.  <comment354706> If the problem is there with one user account, and not another - you should look into the differences between the two. Specifically checked which programs you have set to start a login (login items) and your configuration files. You could try simply moving away your configuration files to an archive folder, and then moving back a few files at a time, logging in and out to see when the problem comes back. Then you have found the cause of the problem.
