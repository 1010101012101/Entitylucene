What is "http://init-p01st.push.apple.com"? <body> Ive seen this popup a few times in my internet tracking. So, what is Apple using this url for? What happens if I block it?  <answer174171> It is a server used for push notifications for iOS and OS X. If you block it, you may not receive push notifications.  <comment274809> what about the `/bag`? `http://init-p01st.push.apple.com/bag` <comment274827> @AfrizaNArief what about it? <comment274830> also for push notification? <comment274831> The whole server is to do with push notifications, hence why it has "push" in the name.
