I'm using git+notational velocity and want to know how to commit after I exit the program <body> What I'm looking to accomplish is have something trigger a git add *.txt and git commit -m "Automated Commit `date`' when I close Notational Velocity. I'm guessing I could probably accomplish this with an AppleScript but I don't know the language well enough. I looked into creating a launchd plist that would watch the main database file and that didn't seem to cause it to trigger a commit at all. Does anyone know of a good way to accomplish this?  <answer20030> Create a bash script with  precode#!/bin/bash cd /path/to/notational/velocity/folder NOW=$(date +"%m-%d-%Y") git add *.txt git commit -m "Automated commit $NOW" killall NotationVelocity # or whatever its name is /code/pre  Then save the script, make it executable with  precodechmod +x name of the script /code/pre  and when you want to close NV, just double-click the script.  <answer20060> You can use Keyboard Maestro to completely automate the task. Here's a screenshot of a macro doing just that :  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bnfpP.png" alt="enter image description here"  You should adapt the bash script to suit your needs, I'm not sure how to include the date in the commit message (in addition, I forgot to put the git add command).  <comment22164> I haven't tried it yet but this looks like what I was trying to accomplish, thanks! <comment22172> You're welcome :) <comment22190> Once I have enough rep I will come back and upvote this :/
