Is there any app to add a keyboard shortcut to a mouse click on a specific location? <body> Basically I have a program that I use to study and I need to be able to quickly choose between a 8 choice answer button. The program does not have inbuilt keyboard shortcuts. I need to answer a question every 2 seconds so moving the mouse around gets tiring if I could just associate where the buttons are to 1-8 on the keyboard that would be great.  <answer86162> Try the TAB + Enter key.  The TAB key should move the cursor to next question, the enter key should answer it.  Setting it up with 1-8 requires more doing, and you need to tell us what program are you using.  <answer86169> Try saving scripts like this in AppleScript Editor and assigning them shortcuts with FastScripts or other applications:  precodetell application "System Events" to tell process "Safari"     click at {923, 186} end tell  tell application "Safari" to tell document 1     do JavaScript "document.querySelectorAll('#hmenus div ul li:nth-child(3) a')[0].click()" end tell  tell application "Google Chrome" to tell tab 1 of window 1     execute javascript "document.querySelectorAll('#hmenus div ul li:nth-child(3) a')[0].click()" end tell /code/pre  Another option would be to use Keyboard Maestro:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7ApmP.png" alt=""
