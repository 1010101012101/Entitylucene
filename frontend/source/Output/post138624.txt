Outlook 2011 not displaying CC in headers of forwards <body> I have an Outlook 2011 user for whom, when they forward emails, the CC list from the forwarded message isn't displayed, only the To and From fields. User's Attribution setting is correct in Preferencesâ€”Composing. A lot of the user's emails are sent as part of maintaining a proper "paper trail," and the department head insists on printing them out as a fixed record of that paper trail, but without the CC info, the trail is incomplete.   Anyone else seen this? Know a fix? The user's inbox has tens of thousands of items, so I'm loathe to reinstall.  Edit: OS X 10.9.4 on a A1419 (EMC 2546 - the late 2012 8GB / 3.4GHz / 27").  <comment163564> What Mac and what OS is it? <comment163581> Thanks for that prompt. Added into to the question.
