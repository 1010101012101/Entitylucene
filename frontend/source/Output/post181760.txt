Can I back up to an SD card? <body> I happy accident occurred this weekend when I left my camera's USB cable at work. I discovered that I have an SD slot in my MacBook Pro.  Can I backup to an SD card using a third party back up package? I typically do a nightly local back up as a fail safe.  <answer181766> I use an SanDisk Ultra miniDrive (64 GB) for transferable storage. However, I use an external hard drive to maintain Time Machine backups.  Of note, for compatibility with Time Machine, the SD's default format (exFat) was incompatible, and I needed to use Disk Utility to reformat to Mac OS Extended (Journaled).  For for information about SD cards, Apple provides information.  <comment216189> You can, but I wouldn't trust an SD card as far as I could spit it as far as reliability goes. Fail rate is alarmingly high.
