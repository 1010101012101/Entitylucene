Can I make aol.com my default email reader in Mavericks instead of Mail? <body> An AOL rep reset my Safari, and since then, whenever I hit kbdcommand/kbdkbdI/kbd it brings up mail instead of italicizing words. How can I change back?  <answer152352> Assuming you already have the AOL mail installed on your system,  go to Apple Mail  (open it)- preferences  Select the Default mail reader to AOL.  The kbdcmd/kbd kbdi/kbd is standard Safari keyboard shortcut to open your default email (AOL) and to send the current webpage- nothing to do with AOL setting it up.  <comment179252> There seems to be two overlapping questions here. Can you narrow this down to one question per question and ask the other separately if necessary?
