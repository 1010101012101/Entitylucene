Screensaver in Lion <body> I like to use events and albums from iPhoto as my screensavers. Lately, only some events and albums show up when I go into preferencesscreensavers.  If I go out and come back in, most will then show,  but once I choose an event or album it doesn't reliably show up when the screensaver should start.  I get message that folder is empty of pictures and to choose a different one.  Suggestions?  <answer36839> I would verify that your iPhoto library is fully intact.  To do this:  ol liOpen Finder and open the code/Applications/code folder./li liScroll down to iPhoto./li liPressing codeOption/code and codeCommand/code, double-click iPhoto./li /ol  You'll be presented with a strongRebuild Photo Library/strong window.  I would check the following options:  ul liRepair the iPhoto Library Database/li liRebuild the photos' small database/li liExamine and repair iPhoto Library file permissions/li /ul  Click codeRebuild/code and wait until the process is complete.  Once it's all done, go back to System Preferences and check to see if you can select iPhoto and albums okay.  If the issue persists, I'd take a look at this article on Mac OS X Hints and follow the steps listed there.  Good Luck!
