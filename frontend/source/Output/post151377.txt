Rotate a video taken on an iPhone, and save it as an MP4 <body> I was recording a video on an iPhone and I had it "upside down" by mistake, meaning the camera was in the bottom-right corner rather than the top-left.  When I watch the video on my Mac in Quicktime, the orientation is fine, anyway, but when I watch it in VLC, then it is upside down. I want to fix the orientation because I want to convert the video from MOV to MP4, and this would also make it upside down (because it loses the orientation/rotation metadata that the MOV file contains, to properly orient the video).  How can I properly rotate the video so that it looks correct?  I tried a few methods already, but none worked. For instance, I tried this (Can HandBrake flip/rotate a video?), but that didn't work for me. I also tried this ( video captured from iphone gets rotated when converted to .mp4 using ffmpeg ) but I got a few errors in Terminal when running the commands, like regarding experimental features, etc.  <answer151426> iMovie &amp; VLC can both do it  I'm not sure VLC can export the result, but iMovie can.  There's also RotateMyVideo which will do it online  iMovie from Crop...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ed7Mb.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  VLC from Effects &amp; Filters  Video Effects  Geometry  Transform  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/D0RMX.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Source : http://www.wikihow.com/Rotate-a-Video  <answer151581> I opened iMovie, and imported the upside down video (which only appears upside down in non-Apple apps, like VLC). Since iMovie is an Apple app, it is able to read the rotation metadata, so it showed the video correctly. I then simply exported the video as an MP4 from iMovie, which resulted in a video with the correct orientation.  No manual rotation was necessary in iMovie since it already was able to read that metadata, as I mentioned.  <comment178101> Do you by any chance have Photoshop? If I remember correctly, it is very easy to do with PS. <comment178142> Photoshop does video now? Never knew that. But no, I don't have Photoshop. That would be a very expensive solution to something that seems relatively simple, at least with the right tools. Often free open source tools can do it, but I just can't get the right combination to work. <comment178379> Although neither method worked for me (and a few of the ones listed on that page are Windows-only or upload-only), it reminded me of iMovie, so that helped. Thanks! <comment178428> Yes, certainly not worth getting Photoshop just to work with the videos. But if you had it I know it works nicely. And yes, it does have some video functionality. Nothing incredible but something.
