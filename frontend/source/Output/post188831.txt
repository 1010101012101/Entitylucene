Thought bubbles in Yosemite <body> When using Preview my Yosemite does NOT have the thought bubble option.. Is it a problem or does Yosemite not offer the thought bubble as Lion did. I can get the speech bubble no problem.  <comment223599> It is no longer there. It was all the way till Mavericks, but then someone decided to remove them. <comment223626> thank you... any easy way to make thought bubbles??
