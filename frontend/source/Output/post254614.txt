USB Devices Un-Responsive When Waking Mac Mini <body> I have a brand-new Mac mini which I bought directly from the Apple store. (I'm a Linux user new to the Apple world). It is OSX, Mac mini Late 2014, 3 GHz Intel Core i7, 16 GB 1600 MHz DDR3 with Intel Iris 1536 MB.   I'm having trouble with devices not working... I use a standard USB keyboard and mouse (read: non-apple) ... when I return to my mini, it's asleep, so I press the power button to turn it on.  Typing and moving the mouse has no affect and I am forced to hold the power button down for 10 seconds before I can actually use the computer and have it recognize the keyboard and mouse.  The mouse LED light is lit, so I know it's being powered-- not sure how to make it actually behave the way one would expect.
