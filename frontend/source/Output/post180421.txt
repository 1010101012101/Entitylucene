How to UNLOCK rotation of the iPad 2 non retina <body> At the bottom of iPad screen, when I swipe up and that pop up appears, there's no picture of rotation lock. Then in settings under General there is a USE SIDE SWITCH TO:  Lock Rotation  (blue check). How do I unlock rotation? I click on the blue check but it doesn't disappear.  EDIT: Every app I click on that used to rotate orientation, now don't rotate.  <answer180422> The strongLock Rotation/strong and the strongMute/strong Under the strongUSE SIDE SWITCH TO:/strong act as radio buttons.  Selecting one deselects the other.  Depending on which one is selected determines what the side switch does.  Either strongMute/strong or  strongMute/strong or strongLock Rotation/strong.  The side switch is either On (showing an orange dot ) or off  (NOT showing an orange dot )  In Mute mode:   ul liside switch ON = silent /li liside switch OFF = sound/li /ul  In Lock Rotation mode:   ul liside switch ON = No Rotation/li liside switch OFF = Rotation/li /ul  The Control Center's  (when you swipe up) button that is used for  strongMute/strong or strongLock Rotation/strong will also change to either a strongMute/strong or strongLock Rotation/strong button depending what is selected in the settings.  So you have full control regardless of how you are setup.  <comment214291> When iPad is in Lock Rotation, no app rotates but there's sound. When iPad is in Mute and not Lock Rotation. Now appropriate apps rotate but there's no sound.  How do I make it that the apps rotate and there is also sound? <comment214292> Select Lock rotation in the menu. And have the side switch set to off (not showing orange) <comment214303> I don't see a side switch on/off button. Under USE SIDE SWITCH TO: it only lets me check LOCK ROTATION or MUTE. I can't press anything else <comment214304> The side switch is a physical switch at the Top right edge of the iPad
