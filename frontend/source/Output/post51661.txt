How to automount SMB share in OS X <body> I am running OS X Lion.  I have the following line in my /etc/fstab:  code//darren:q@acid/home   /acid   smbfs   nodev,nosuid,auto/code  If I run codemount -a/code, the share mounts correctly, but if I just reboot the computer, the drive does not mount.  The drive in question is an Ubuntu SMB share.  Can anyone advise?  <answer51663> You need to mount the drive once, then go to Settings Panel and Users &amp; Groups. There you can add it. If you hide it, it will mount but don't open the finder screen upon logging in.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/b9ZWG.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer76714> I ran across this today which is one way to do it.  In summary for Mountain Lion:  ol liEdit the file /etc/auto_master/li liWithin add code/- auto_smb/code/li liCreate /etc/auto_smb/li liWithin add code/Volumes/mount_point -fstype=smbfs,soft ://user:pass@smbserver/share/code/li /ol  The author goes onto mention a second method using the vifs command, but I've never tried that one and it seems to do something of a pre-mount at bootup. You still have to touch the Volume for it to completely mount.  Lastly, the author states that "soft" should be used in step 4 above because failures to mount will cause the bootup to hang.  <comment88945> Thanks for the answer. Would you mind summarizing the instructions provided in the link? It is often good to include a link with your answer, however, links can break over time, so it best that they are not solely the answer. <comment106004> He's not talking about Amazon Cloud Drive; your response does not apply to regular filesystem mounts. <comment106017> It does. Screenshot only show the screen where you should do it, not the program. <comment110126> OK.  How then do you automount an SMB drive via Settings  Users & Groups  Login Items  I've done it via the accepted answer (/etc/auto_master and /etc/auto_smb), but I don't know what program you would put into Settings  Users & Groups  Login Items to make it work.  A bash script of your own devising?  If so, what would the script say? <comment110261> Just use Finder to mount it, then you can add it to the screen above. <comment110460> oh, now I see what you mean (when you just said "then you can add it" it wasn't clear you meant "drag the mounted volume onto the Login Items list"). I didn't know that volumes could be added to that list ... but, clearly, they can.  That's a great tip, thanks!
