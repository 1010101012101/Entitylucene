Random podcasts appeared in the podcast app <body> I recently reset my iPhone and restored it using my latest iCloud backup. I noticed in the podcast app that four Christian podcasts appeared under a "Not Subscribed" section (seemed interesting that all of the podcasts had the same general theme). I had never subscribed to, or even heard of, the four podcasts. I deleted them and closed the podcast app. Now each time I reopen the podcast app, one of the podcasts continues to reappear and attempts to start downloading an episode.  I found this question that sounded oddly similar, but it had no answers.  strongUpdate/strong  I tried removing all podcasts and syncing with iTunes on my computer (which shows no current podcast subscriptions), but this random podcast still appears.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lZk2A.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer265061> I'm not sure why this worked, but I reset my iPhone a strongsecond time/strong and restored it from the strongsame/strong iCloud backup and that seems to have fixed it.  <comment332310> Please mark this as the best answer then <comment332311> @RushilSrivastava Tried to, but it told me I couldn't accept the answer for another 15 hours. I will accept it once the site allows it.
