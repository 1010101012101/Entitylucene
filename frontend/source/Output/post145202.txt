How to view the notification centre on my "new" iPhone 4? <body> I recently got an iPhone 4, and I can't access its notification centre. From the lock screen, pulling down allows me to access it, but as soon as I enter my 4 digit password and access the home screen, I can no longer access it. My Version is 7.1.2.  <comment171105> again, how far do you get after entering the password?
