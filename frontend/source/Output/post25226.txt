Is there a way to "split" one display so that it treated as two separate screens? <body> Is there any app or hack which can split a monitor into multiple screens? So for instance, a 1920x1080 display could be treated by the operating system as though there were two 960x1080 screens connected instead.  <answer25449> h2There is No: True Multi-Monitor Support for a Single Display/h2  There is no way to get the OS to treat a single display as more than one display.  h2You Can:  Fill Defined Sections of your Screen with an App/h2  You can get very close to what you are looking for with a tool like SizeUp or Divvy. They will allow you to fill sections of your screen with an app. Halves, quarters, etc.  <answer99387> Adding my vote for Moom! Excellent - as simple or complex as you need it to be, and keeps out of the way. http://manytricks.com/moom/  <comment28479> It might help to specify exactly what you are wanting to do with those two screens (and if it is Apple specific). There may be other ways to accomplish whatever your goal is than to get the OS to treat one monitor as two. <comment28496> @lemonginger: I mostly want to be able to full-screen zoom on apps within sub-windows. (It would also be nice if Lion's full-screen mode played nice with multi-window setups, but that's another subject...)  Lri: I'm fine with removing that, I'll check out the other question for alternatives. <comment28497> ahhh, yeah not sure on that one. I agree that multi-monitor support in Lion so far is a big step backwards from SL. Hoping that 10.7.2 fixes some things. <comment100562> Another couple of options, just because different people prefer different ways of working, are http://www.trifleapps.com/arrange.html and http://spectacleapp.com/ . The latter is free and very good if all you need are the basics. <comment116948> StackExchnage sites show votes by clicking the up arrows not by extra answers/comments. However this is the first mention of moom so could you explain what it does
