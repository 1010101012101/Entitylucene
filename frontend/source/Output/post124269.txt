Why is my Launchpad missing app icons? <body> Sometimes my Launchpad just look like this without any app icons. What causes this problem and how can I solve it?  I am using 2011 11â€³ MacBook Air with OS X 10.9.1  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/f5Fmu.png" alt="Screenshot"  <answer126781> Delete the Dock database files and relaunch Dock:  precoderm ~/Library/Application\ Support/Dock/*.db &amp;&amp; killall -HUP Dock /code/pre  <answer144910> This didn't work for me,br Finder did not respond, clicking on Apps gave this error    precodeCould not obtain valid temporary directory for sandboxed app ... /code/pre  I also had to open a terminal and run:  precodecd /var/folder sudo rm -rf * /code/pre  Searched for and opened Activity Monitor, stopped the com.apple.IconServicesAgent service and rebooted.  My icons came back in launchpad and dock.  <answer164614> i read on another website if you type the following in terminal the launch pad gets back to normal:  coderm ~/Library/Application\ Support/Dock/*.db; killall Dock/code  i had the same problem and this worked so hope it helps anyone else with the same problem.  <answer232678> A less intrusive way to tell LaunchPad to reset it's settings and regenerate app listing and icons is to perform this command line step:  precodedefaults -currentHost write com.apple.dock ResetLaunchPad -bool true; killall Dock /code/pre  Your screen desktop may blank and the dock will go away momentarily. If this doesn't work, the next step is to log out and back in. A reboot also could help further in some limited cases.

The question is pretty vague. <comment148511> I don't recommend to delete these files, to my know this resets the while dock. <comment148512> This happens to me sometimes too specially when my mac has pretty much to do. <comment167558> @wumm Yes it will reset the dock, but it is also likely to fix the problem. You can always make a backup of the files first and restore them if the problem was not fixed. <comment361559> You could take a look at https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/286549/18660 and see if that helps
