Getting duplicate iOS notifications from IFTTT <body> I use IFTTT to send me iOS notifications for some of my recipes, but for some reason, every time it sends me a notification, it sends it twice. So every notification I get from IFTTT is duplicated.   Anyone know why this happens, and how I can fix it?  <answer169773> I just fixed this. What I did was I deleted the iOS Notifications channel, then deleted the app from my iPhone, then re-installed the app, re-activated the channel, and re-created the recipe.
