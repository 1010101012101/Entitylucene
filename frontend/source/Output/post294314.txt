How can I disable color management on OS X? <body> I'm not sure if it's possible but I'd like to disable color management on OS X, or at least when working with Photoshop and Illustrator. The problem is that no matter what I do in both application when trying to set a color mode, a color profile or the Proof Color options, both apps are showing different colors for the same image.  Here is a screenshot with how it looks when I have both application windows with one part over the built-in monitor and the other over an external monitor.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/b1YIb.png" alt="enter image description here"  Also, when I was tracking down the issue, I discovered that when dragging the windows from one monitor to the other, the colors look like if the window is still on the first monitor, but then change to how they look in the second monitor after I stop dragging the window. This makes me thing that is not a color calibration issue, but rather something with the way the app manage the color profile for that monitor.  So, is there a way to solve this problem? maybe disabling color management at all for the whole system, or only for some applications?  <answer294334> If you go into codeSettings &gt; Displays &gt; Color &gt; Calibrate/code you should be able to make your display mirror the colors on your external display. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AX27Z.png" alt="Color Settings" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/62fcM.png" alt="Color Calibration"  <comment371504> If you disabled colour management it would simply be wrong on both screens. <comment371510> Best practices suggest avoiding different colour management applications at the same time to avoid conflicts in the way the image is rendered. <comment371526> Do you mean Color LCD is the option to disable color management? <comment371529> @Stan Hmm.. I hadn't thought about that, not sure if that the case when using Photoshop and Illustrator both at the same time though. <comment371615> I don't think it's possible to disable it altogether but the Color Settings are where you'd go to calibrate or edit it in order to fix any color problems you're having with your display.
