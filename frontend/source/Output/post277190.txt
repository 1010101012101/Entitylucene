Python 3 ImportError: cannot import name 'Config' when importing boto3 after installing with pip3 <body> Currently trying to configure Python3 correctly with boto3 to utilize the AWS Dynamo Python SDK. I've used HomeBrew to install Python3 and then I've installed pip and pip3 for my python 2 and python 3 versions respectively.  I've also installed boto and boto3 for both Python2 and Python3.  precodeworkspace: python -c "import boto" workspace: python -c "import boto3" workspace: python3 -c "import boto" workspace: python3 -c "import boto3" Traceback (most recent call last):   File "&lt;string&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;   File "/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/boto3/__init__.py", line 16, in &lt;module&gt;     from boto3.session import Session   File "/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/boto3/session.py", line 18, in &lt;module&gt;     from botocore.client import Config ImportError: cannot import name 'Config' /code/pre  But it's Python 3 that's giving me the problem as you can see above. Here's my full setup:  precodeworkspace: which python /usr/bin/python workspace: which python3 /usr/local/bin/python3  workspace: brew list --versions python3 python3 3.6.0_1  workspace: sudo pip install boto; sudo pip install boto3; Requirement already satisfied: boto in /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages Requirement already satisfied: boto3 in /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages Requirement already satisfied: jmespath&lt;1.0.0,&gt;=0.7.1 in /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages (from boto3) Requirement already satisfied: s3transfer&lt;0.2.0,&gt;=0.1.10 in /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages (from boto3) Requirement already satisfied: botocore&lt;1.6.0,&gt;=1.5.0 in /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages (from boto3) Requirement already satisfied: futures&lt;4.0.0,&gt;=2.2.0; python_version == "2.6" or python_version == "2.7" in /    Library/Python/2.7/site-packages (from s3transfer&lt;0.2.0,&gt;=0.1.10-&gt;boto3) Requirement already satisfied: docutils&gt;=0.10 in /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages (from botocore&lt;1.6.0,&gt;=1.5.0-    &gt;boto3) Requirement already satisfied: python-dateutil&lt;3.0.0,&gt;=2.1 in /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages (from     botocore&lt;1.6.0,&gt;=1.5.0-&gt;boto3) Requirement already satisfied: six&gt;=1.5 in /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages (from python-dateutil&lt;3.0.0,&gt;=2.1-&gt;    botocore&lt;1.6.0,&gt;=1.5.0-&gt;boto3)      workspace: pip3 install boto; pip3 install boto3; Requirement already satisfied: boto in /usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages Requirement already satisfied: boto3 in /usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages Requirement already satisfied: botocore&lt;1.6.0,&gt;=1.5.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages (from boto3) Requirement already satisfied: jmespath&lt;1.0.0,&gt;=0.7.1 in /usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages (from boto3) Requirement already satisfied: s3transfer&lt;0.2.0,&gt;=0.1.10 in /usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages (from boto3) Requirement already satisfied: docutils&gt;=0.10 in /usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages (from botocore&lt;1.6.0,&gt;=1.5.0-&gt;boto3) Requirement already satisfied: python-dateutil&lt;3.0.0,&gt;=2.1 in /usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages (from botocore&lt;1.6.0,&gt;=1.5.0-&gt;boto3) Requirement already satisfied: six&gt;=1.5 in /usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages (from python-dateutil&lt;3.0.0,&gt;=2.1-&gt;botocore&lt;1.6.0,&gt;=1.5.0-&gt;boto3) /code/pre  The frustrating thing is that boto3 works totally fine on Python 2.7.10 which came with my macOS install. But I'd like to use Python 3 and can't seem to continue with it.  <answer283414> It will work if you specifically install Python 3.5, not sure if they have updated it for 3.6 yet, but recently it was incompatible with it.
