Can you use Touch ID to bypass system password prompts? <body> Touch ID on my new MacBook Pro is pretty great, but I only seem to be able to use it to unlock the machine, not bypass/replace my system password once I'm in.  Is there a way to enable this?  <comment328156> Have you completed the setup for Touch ID?  If so, you should be able to use it to make purchases with iTunes, iBooks, Apple Pay, Safari, etc. <comment328165> @fsb Yes, and it works fine for those things. It seems that the app showing the password prompt has to specifically allow for itâ€” the newest Xcode allows TouchID to replace local password, but not to get the dev password out of the keychain. I suppose that's coming sometime in the future? <comment328167> I would agree.  The api is new and dev's still have to incorporate it into their applications (for example, [this sample code](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/samplecode/KeychainTouchID/Introduction/Intro.html) from Apple). <comment328304> Great question! I still have to type in my password whenever I want to change system settings, install new applications, ... Using TouchID for those tasks would be great.
