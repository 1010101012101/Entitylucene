Issue in disabling SIP (rootless) in El Capitan <body> I have just installed El Capitan and I immediately experimented some problems because of the new SIP mechanism. Some tools I need as well as some tweaks did not work anymore. So, I decided to turn it off using the Apple "official" procedure (boot to Recovery, codecsrutil disable/code, reboot).  Now all my tools etc. are back working again. But if I check the SIP status using the csrutil utility I get:  precode$  csrutil status System Integrity Protection status: enabled (Custom Configuration).  Configuration:     Apple Internal: disabled     Kext Signing: disabled     Filesystem Protections: disabled     Debugging Restrictions: disabled     DTrace Restrictions: disabled     NVRAM Protections: disabled      This is an unsupported configuration, likely to break in the future and leave your machine in an unknown state. /code/pre  The fact it says "status: enabled" is strange, but it does not worry me to much because, after, all the elements are disabled. I cannot rest easy with the sentence "...likely to break in the future and leave your machine in an unknown state".  Any ideas about this output?! Thanks in advance  <answer210632> If all functions listed are showing as being disabled, SIP is actually completely disabled; itâ€™s just confusingly worded.  My friend had the same problem so I did some research online and found out that it is a bug. There is a bug report on this message; it is bug ID 22361698 and is cross-posted to Open Radar here:  https://openradar.appspot.com/radar?id=4932475130216448  In the above link it says to:  ol liBoot to Recovery HD/li liOpen Terminal/li liRun the following command: /usr/bin/csrutil disable/li /ol  You should then receive the following output:  ol start="4" liSystem Integrity Protection status: disabled./li /ol  <comment255568> Yes, It was exactly what I did. Probably, as you say, it is a bug.
