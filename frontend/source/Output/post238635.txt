Missing lock icon in System Preferences->Sharing on El Capitan <body> See attached image below. I have a few macs and on one of them, I cannot for the life of me figure out how to lock the Sharing tab under System Preferences. The lock is present and working on other panes that support locking. I also went to Security &amp; Privacy advanced and could not find anything there. How do I re-enable the ability to lock this pane and does anyone know why or how it got that way? My other Macs don't have this problem.  Edit: I am including another screenshot from my other Mac to show that there is indeed a lock on that pane.  I am running OS X El Capitan 10.11.2 on a Macbook Pro Retina (late 2013)img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9KBQz.jpg" alt="Mac OS X System Preferences Pane"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/t4geC.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer238637> There is no lock on this screen.  There is only a lock if the setting requires an codeAdministrator/code (someone with the role of strongAdministrator/strong) to make the changes (i.e. strongSecurity/strong).  If anyone can make the changes then there's no need for a lock.  Make sure you're logged-in with the role of strongAdministrator/strong to see the preferences that you can lock/unlock.  strongEDIT: based on OP's new comments:/strongbr/   - Log in as a user with strongAdministrator/strong rights.br/   - Open codeSystem Preferences/code and select codeSecurity &amp; Privacy/code.br/   - Click the lock icon and authenticate.br/   - Click the codeAdvanced/code button at the bottom and enable the codeRequire an Administrator.../code in the popup window.br/   - codeOK/code the change and then lock the S&amp;P preference pane.br/  Now when you open the codeSharing/code preference pane you will have your lock back.  <comment292707> There is a lock on that screen. See below from my other Mac.  https://imgur.com/PZA0BrA <comment292708> There is only one account on that machine and it is the administrator account. I have no other accounts and guest is disabled. <comment292716> I don't have the lock on my Mac and I'm the only user and administrator. <comment292741> I don't understand. I don't want anyone to be able to make the change. Not even me unless I unlock the setting with a password just like other panes in Preferences. You say "anyone can make the changes then there's no need for a lock" but I don't want this. I want it like my other Mac where not anyone can make the change as I have locked it. Both machines only have 1 user and that user is the administrator. So why does one machine not have it? How come you and and fbara don't see this? There must be a setting somewhere. <comment292743> See my edited answer. <comment292761> That's it!!!! Thanks. I would delete the first paragraph of the current answer and make the edit the answer. This is exactly what I wanted.
