Merging Time Machine backups on two drive <body> I have a RAID I have used for years as my Time Machine Backup.  Recently the volume I have my backups on got corrupted and unusable. I also have a TMB on a NAS with about half a year of backups already on it. If I copy the folders from the failing drive onto the NAS, will TM detect them and allow backups from them?  Will TM clean up the drive by adding hard links?  <comment341323> @fsb, that question talks about using a new drive for backups and possibly moving them to a fresh drive. However, in my case, the destination already has time machine backups on it.  My question is if I move a backup folder to the NAS TM, will it get indexed properly to be used?
