How can I simulate a keypress of 'Insert'? <body> I have an application that I'm running through Wine 1.6.2. I need to simulate a keypress of Windows' "Insert" key. How can I do this?  Some background: I'm running a game in Wine that I'm connecting a joystick to with Enjoy2. I'm tricking the game into thinking that joystick actions are keypresses, and it works quite well - except for the emone thing/em in the game that's assigned to "insert".   <comment185107> try the one above the 7 key on the 10-key pad like an x in a square. idk the equivalent if your on a laptop. <comment185109> @Tetsujin On a laptop, yes. But I might be able to go get a Windows keyboard, would that help? <comment185110> possibly, never tried it
