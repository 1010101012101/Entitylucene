How to bind hostname with ip? <body> There are 2 VMs running on VMWare on a remote server. For instance: devops-01 and devops-02. Both of them have SSH access enabled.br To access to the first one I do: codessh dev@devops-01/code. For the other one: codessh dev@192.168.80.y/code (codey/code sometimes changes).   Normally I only used devops-01 and rarely the other one. Today, it all changed. Ideally I would like to access both VMs like this: codessh dev@devops-&lt;ID&gt;/code. But, I'm sure that involves calling the server guy and he's on vacations. So, I thought in "switching" my VMs settings.    I copied all the settings from codeSystem Preferes &gt; Network &gt; Ethernet/code from the devops-01 and pasted them to the devops-02 corresponding settings. (IP, Subnet Mask, Router, DNS Server, Search Domains are the same).br I also went to codeSystem Preferences &gt; Sharing/code and edited the computer name on devops-02. (So now, it says devops-01).br Then, I stoped the emold/em devops-01 VM. And now, I have the emold/em devops-02 VM running, supplanting devops-01. strongBUT/strong codeping devops-01/codesays that there is no route to it. Of course it works fine using the ip. But, that's not my intention.  strongWhat am I doing wrong?/strong  <answer214612> Correct me if I'm wrong here, but you'd like a hostname to direct you to a specific IP address of your choice. If so, edit the hosts file located in strong/etc/hosts/strong by adding a line like this below the localhost entry:  em123.45.67.89 devops-01/em  Again, correct me if I'm misunderstanding you.  <comment259176> Yes. I want a hostname to direct to a specific IP. But, doing what you suggest only works in my current computer. If I go to other computer, I'll need to do it again. - Before messing up with my changes, I was able to access it without modifying /etc/hosts. <comment259177> But you said it only worked for one of them (devops-1), or did you mean both? <comment259179> Yes. I was able to access devops-01 from all the computers in my network. But that was not the case for devops-02. The latter one was a test machine, but now... it should replace the first one. <comment259449> One way this can happen is that the VM got a different IP-address (from DHCP?) than is stated in DNS. If you do a `nslookup devops-01`. Do you get the same IP as the IP for the VM? <comment259601> @JoachimBratteli, nope.  nslookup devops-01 ;; Got SERVFAIL reply from 192.168.85.45, trying next server Server:  192.168.85.30 Address: 192.168.85.30#50  ** server can't find devops-01: SERVFAIL <comment259723> Seems like the IP of devops-01 is not resolved by your DNS-server. Either your IP configuration is pointing at the wrong DNS-server or you need to fix the setup of your DNS-server.
