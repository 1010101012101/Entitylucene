How to configure postgresql in Lion <body> I am new in mac os. I was trying to install Postgresql. Before i did not know there is a Postgresql already available with default installation. So, I downloaded Postgresql 8.4 and installed it. I changed the configuration as the instruction.   [sudo vi /etc/sysctl.conf]  precodekern.sysv.shmmax=33554432 kern.sysv.shmmin=1 kern.sysv.shmmni=256 kern.sysv.shmseg=64 kern.sysv.shmall=8192 /code/pre  ol liI changed strongemkern.sysv.shmall=33554432/em/strong and saved it. Then whenever I installed the postgresql 8.4 it shows an error. Now I do not know is it already installed or not? How can I check it?/li liAfter that, I found some command and execute those. But I do not know how to fix it?

Are you trying to re-run the installer?  In answer to two, take a look at http://www.jonathandean.com/2011/08/postgresql-8-4-on-mac-os-x-10-7-lion/ who seems to have gotten it sorted.  There absolutely is a GUI for PostgreSQL, it's called pgAdmin 3 (or pgAdmin III). If you successfully installed the OS X version of PostgreSQL from their site, then you should already have it (take a peek in Launchpad). If it's not there, you can get it at http://www.pgadmin.org/ but read the downloads page carefully---it isn't well sorted and the most up-to-date version is in the middle of the list.  As EmmEff said, in future Homebrew or MacPorts might be easier (especially if you like playing around!) since you can wipe the install cleanly.  <answer57330> To avoid all those heartaches, you might want to check out Postgres.app. Just copy to the Applications folder and you're done. From the Github page:     Postgres.app is the easiest way to get started with PostgreSQL on the   Mac. Open the app, and you have a PostgreSQL server ready and awaiting   new connections. Close the app, and the server shuts down.   As for the client, check out Navicat. Good luck!  <comment46391> You're probably going to want to reinstall Lion to ensure you get the stock version back, otherwise start removing all the remnants of both versions and install 8.4 again.  In the future, use something like Homebrew or MacPorts to install generic packages into a safe location.  That way if anything goes wrong, you can remove it without affecting the base OS installation. <comment68786> That is really neat! Great idea for testing.
