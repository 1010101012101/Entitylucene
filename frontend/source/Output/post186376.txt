Hotkey to show hidden files and folders in File Open dialog? <body> This question is very similar to Is it possible to always show hidden/dotfiles in Open/Save dialogs?. How to show hidden files and folders in finder? is also related. However, I strongemdon't/em/strong want to always show them, and that's what codedefaults write ... AppleShowAllFiles .../code does.  Rather, I want to switch it on when needed. I'm trying to open code.bash_profile/code, so I need it now:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4Zofq.png" alt="enter image description here"  Linux and Gnome allow us to kbdCTRL/kbd+kbdH/kbd to toggle between showing and hiding hidden files. But Gnome hotkeys don't work on OS X (which is expected).  For completeness, code.bash_profile/code does exist in the home directory:  precode$ ls ~/.bash_profile  /Users/jww/.bash_profile /code/pre  hr  A related question... As can be seen above, typing the filename in Finder (or is it Spotlight) search did not work. I tried to right click to get a context menu in the File Open dialog in hopes of checking a box like "show all files". And I tried the View menu looking for a "show all files" with the File Open dialog open.  Why is this hidden away somewhere? What purpose does it serve to strongemnot/em/strong allow a user to easily open a file?  <answer186378> kbd⌘ CMD/kbd+kbd⇧ SHIFT/kbd+kbd./kbd reveals hidden files in Finder and Open/Save dialogs.  hr  You can also press kbd⌘ CMD/kbd+kbd⇧ SHIFT/kbd+kbdG/kbd and type the path to the hidden folder, just like in Terminal (kbd⇥ TAB/kbd autocompletion also works).  Editing hidden files can be dangerous if you don't know what you're doing.  <answer186388> Mateusz Szlosek covered the first part. Below is how I have handled the second part for my own use.  In my haste to post my answer, I did not realize the second part has already has been answered. See How to set ⌘ + H to enable show hidden files. What I offer below differs by a dialog informing you of the current status.   I created a service using the Automator application. When I want to toggle the viewing of hidden files, I select "Toggle Hidden Files" from the Finder services submenu as shown below. (Hint: Click image for a better view.)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/chHbw.png" alt=""  This will cause either pop shown below to appear.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zTZaz.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pskCf.png" alt="enter image description here"  The steps to create the service are give below.  ol liOpen the Automator, select a new document of type Service./li liDrag the action "Run Shell Script" to the workflow pane./li liEdit the contains to appear as shown below. (Hint: Click image for a better view.)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PtaGf.png" alt=""  The text for the script is repeated below.  precodeSTATUS=`defaults read com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles 2&gt;/dev/null` if [ "$STATUS" == TRUE ]; then     STATUS=`osascript -e 'tell app "Finder" to display alert "Finder is showing hidden files." buttons {"Cancel", "Hide"}'` else     STATUS=`osascript -e 'tell app "Finder" to display alert "Finder is not showing hidden files." buttons {"Cancel", "Show"}'` fi if [ "$STATUS" == "button returned:Show" ]; then     defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE     killall Finder elif [ "$STATUS" == "button returned:Hide" ]; then     defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles FALSE     killall Finder fi /code/pre/li liSave (or move) the codeToggle Hidden Files.workflow/code file to the code~/Library/Services/code folder./li liYou may need to relaunch the Finder application in order for the service to appear on a menu./li /ol  h2Update 1/h2  Building off of Mateusz Szlosek's answer, I see the keyboard shortcut kbd⌘ CMD/kbd+kbd⇧ SHIFT/kbd+kbd./kbd could be added for my service. Go to System Preferences and click on the Keyboard icon. Select "Services" then "Toggle Hidden Files" under the "General" heading. Replace "none" with the kbd⌘ CMD/kbd+kbd⇧ SHIFT/kbd+kbd./kbd keyboard short cut.  <answer246938> strongDISCLAIMER/WARNING/strong   Hidden files are hidden for a reason usually. Use the script below only if you're reasonably sure you know what you're doing. In other words: If you break your system by randomly deleting hidden files, it's your own fault.  hr  Here's the script I use to toggle show/don't show hidden files inside strongFinder/strong.   (The OSX native shortcut to toggle hidden files in strongOpen/Save dialogues/strong was mentioned by Mateusz Szlosek above already)  The difference between my script and others I've seen so far:   Most scripts don't do anything else after killing Finder. Usually, this means you have to navigate back to the folder you were in originally, since the automatic Finder relaunch doesn't reliably open your last active folder.  strongThe script below instead reopens, and focuses on, your last active folder, i.e. the folder you were in when using the toggle, but now showing (or not showing) hidden files./strong  I assigned a shortcut to it (cmd+shift+.) and find working with hidden files in Finder a lot more convenient now.  Credit to Tetsujin who posted a script on this site a while ago that I adapted to add the 'reopen last folder' functionality.  precodeon run {input, parameters}     tell application "Finder"         set var1 to POSIX path of (target of window 1 as alias)     end tell     set newHiddenVisiblesState to "YES"     set oldHiddenVisiblesState to do shell script "defaults read com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles"     if oldHiddenVisiblesState is in {"1", "YES"} then         set newHiddenVisiblesState to "NO"     end if     do shell script "defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles " &amp; newHiddenVisiblesState     ---- Sleep hack mentioned below. 0.5s minimum, 1-2s safer. Ugly, but (probably) unavoidable.     do shell script "killall Finder; sleep 0.5s"     tell application "Finder"         ---- Close other windows if Finder managed to relaunch already         if application "Finder" is running then             close every window         end if         open (var1 as POSIX file)         activate     end tell end run /code/pre  To use the script: Open a new workflow in Automator, drag in "Run AppleScript", copy&amp;paste the code above, and save inside your services folder (usually, ~/Library/Services/, afaik).  Attaching a shortcut to execute a script should be covered somewhere else on this site. I limited the scope of my shortcut to Finder alone.  hr  Style remark:  I have to resort to a bit of an ugly hack, using 'sleep' after killing Finder, before manually opening the original folder.   If I don't force this delay, there's a chance OSX relaunched Finder already and opened a folder (not necessarily the last active one, in my experience). Together with my own 'open' command, this can lead to the nasty effect of two (unkillable, even) Finder processes running, and Finder not working anymore at all. If this happens, logging out and back in again fixes it, but it's a waste of time obviously, so I use 'sleep'.   A sleep value of 0.5s works for me, but to be on the safe side, you can slightly increase it (adding a more noticeable delay to the process then).  If someone knows of a way to either suppress the Finder relaunch and unreliable opening of some window after sending the killall signal -- or some other way to get rid of the 'sleep' hack -- I'd be happy to hear it!  <answer282809> This might be a new feature, but on Sierra, kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbdShift ⇧/kbd kbd . /kbd will toggle hidden file display in the finder.  <comment220002> Works for me in Column view if I change path - go to another drive & back again, etc. - or change view, to icon & back. <comment305586> Are you aware that your username is still readable in those screenshots? :P <comment323397> I did exactly as you've told (there is said file in my ~/Library/Services folder), but to no avail even after restarting the computer. <comment323411> @Walter: I have added the `Toggle Hidden Files.workflow` to Sourceforge.net. See the site: [Toggle Hidden Files](https://sourceforge.net/projects/toggle-hidden-files/files/?source=navbar). You can download the workflow from there. The instructions for installation are also show at this site. <comment326453> The keyboard shortcut "cmd+shift+." seems to work on a broader scale in Finder in Sierra (not just the Open/Save dialogs), in several views as well. <comment356420> I believe that's the answer provided by @Mateusz. <comment356616> You're right. I thought the question was about finder windows as well. <comment359342> Wow, can't believe there is a shortcut for this, how oddly specific. Thanks! <comment366596> wow! this is exactly what I was searching for! thanks! <comment372774> @MattFletcher, Where? I can't see it in the past versions.... <comment372778> @Mateusz, Does cmdshiftG even works without a first cmdshiftdot? <comment372780> @Pacerier sure, why not? <comment372853> @MateuszSzlosek, Doesn't seem to work for me. cmdshiftG cannot select the hidden file, not unless I first do a cmdshiftdot. It works for you? <comment372910> Ah I get what you mean. So Yes CMD+SHIFT+G won't select hidden file unless you reveal them using CMD+SHIFT+. But You can still navigate to hidden folders using CMD+SHIFT+G without revealing them. Good point! <comment372915> As in it's not blurred enough to make it undecipherable. I can easily read what the blurred text says <comment372937> @MattFletcher - You can also go to my profile, view my name and get my email address. Or you can get it through my GitHub profile. What's the point? <comment372950> It was just because it was blurred, so I'd assumed that was done intentionally. No need to get antsy
