Can Numbers use 8 hour long days when converting from days to hours? <body> Using Numbers 3.6.2, I am using cells formatted as "Duration" in days. I then have a SUM cell that sums all the durations and shows for example "64d" (Suppose in cell D1).  I then do in a new cell (D2 for example) the following formula: code=D1/code and change the display days to hours. It shows "1536h".   But I want to use days of 8h (a normal average working day). How can I do this?  If I change the formula to code=D1*8/code, then I get 8 times as many days which is certainly not what I want.  <answer238703> Changing the formula to code=D1/24*8/code does the trick.
