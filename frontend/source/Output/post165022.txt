Problem with installing Java: java: command not found <body> I just installed Java 8.25 but I'm still not getting 'legacy' applications to work. I tried verifying the version in terminal:  precodemanfred$ java --version -bash: java: command not found /code/pre  I think there's a conflict between two versions or something perhaps. How can I solve this?  <answer166781> Looks like Java is not in the path.  I do something like this in my ~/.bash_profile  precode# Get Java Home for the specific version JAVA_HOME=`/usr/libexec/java_home -v1.8 2&gt;/dev/null` # Add Java to the path export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH /code/pre  Quit terminal once you create or edit ~/.bash_profile.  FYI if you are creating ~/.bash_profile make sure you give it executable privileges.  <comment193588> How did you install Java? <comment193673> @Mark the .dmg with installer. <comment193676> which dmg? Oracles JRE, or JDK etc <comment193677> @Mark First I did the Oracle JRE 8.25 and then the JDK 8.25... <comment193681> As per my answer [here](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/112533/237) Oracles's OS X  JRE does not install /usr/bin/java. I would reinstall the JDK and check what is in /usr/bin <comment195540> ~/.bash_profile does not need executable privileges <comment195542> Interesting all these years I have been making sure my bash start up scripts have execute privilege.  Good to know that is not needed.
