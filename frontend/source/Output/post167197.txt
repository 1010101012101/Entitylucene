Non USB iPhone Charger <body> Does anybody know of any non-USB chargers for iPhone (lightning connector)? I need a charger that can only plug into an AC outlet and not have any type of USB connector.  <answer167200> Found this a BH in a 20 second google search! http://www.bhphotovideo.com/bnh/controller/home?O=&amp;sku=902893&amp;gclid=CJ6GgZrLkcMCFWFp7AodCg4AzQ&amp;Q=&amp;is=REG&amp;A=details  <answer167203> OK, if for "Edward Snowden" reason you can not use any USB connection in your work place, there is a alternative solution:  It is a 2 piece set that allows you to charge you phone in the car and in the office for $25 total.  1- Get a car charger to lightning like this one  2- get a car charger to wall adapter. Like this one.  <comment196036> what did you find so far? <comment196037> There are some that do this that plug into a DC outlet, but every AC charger I've seen is some variation of the charger the device ships with (i.e. a lightning to USB cable that plugs into a brick that plugs into an AC outlet <comment196038> That is all I found so far (AC- USB out- Lightning end) so why no USB? <comment196044> so you need hard wired version :) <comment196110> Can you just permanently glue the USB into the socket with epoxy?
