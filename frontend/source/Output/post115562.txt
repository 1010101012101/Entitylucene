How do I disable the Minimize (command-M) shortcut in Mavericks? <body> I want to unset the Cmd+M shortcut but I can't seem to find it. I've checked  codeSystem Preferences &gt; Keyboard &gt; Shortcuts/code but no luck there. I've even tried running codedefaults write -g NSUserKeyEquivalents -dict-add 'Minimize' '\0'/code to no avail.  <answer115584> The easiest way to do this is to install a key remapper (I use KeyRemap4MacBook). Though the name seems to suggest otherwise, currently KeyRemap4MacBook actually works with all Apple computer products that can run OS X 10.4 or later, including iMac, Mac mini, and Mac Pro.  Using this method, you can map ⌘M, which OS X maps to the minimize function by default, to Fn+⌘M, which is significantly harder to accidentally press, and which OS X maps to no functionality by default.  In other words, you can swap the functionality of these two key combinations so that ⌘M no longer has a functionality and is essentially disabled. While it is not strictly "disabling" the shortcut, this workaround achieves the same effect.  Use the following steps to disable the minimize shortcut in Mavericks:  h31. Install KeyRemap4MacBook/h3  Download the appropriate code.DMG/code file from the link above and double click it. If you get a message like this:     Your security preferences allow installation of only apps from the Mac App Store and identified developers   Then open the codeSystem Preferences/code program already installed on your computer and, under the codePersonal/code tab, select codeSecurity &amp; Privacy/code. Next, under the codeGeneral/code tab, click the lock in the lower left corner to make changes (provide an administrative password if needed), and under codeAllow applications downloaded from:/code label, select the codeAnywhere/code radio button.  Now you can install the application; you may need to restart once it's finished.  h32. Configuring the custom settings/h3  While KeyRemap4MacBook offers a diverse collection of useful features, disabling the minimize shortcut is not among them. Instead, it provides a handy XML file that you can modify using their API to achieve almost any key remapping you can think of.  Open KeyRemap4MacBook, and navigate to the codeMisc &amp; Uninstall/code tab. Under the codeCustom Setting/code label, click the codeOpen private.xml/code button. Make sure the document opens in a plain-text editor such as TextEdit. Once opened, you should see a blank XML file with empty coderoot/code tags. Replace the entirety of its contents with the following code snippet:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;     &lt;item&gt;         &lt;name&gt;Disable Minimize&lt;/name&gt;         &lt;identifier&gt;private.disable_minimize&lt;/identifier&gt;         &lt;autogen&gt;             __KeyToKey__             KeyCode::M, ModifierFlag::COMMAND_L,             KeyCode::M, ModifierFlag::COMMAND_L | ModifierFlag::FN         &lt;/autogen&gt;         &lt;autogen&gt;             __KeyToKey__             KeyCode::M, ModifierFlag::COMMAND_L | ModifierFlag::FN,             KeyCode::M, ModifierFlag::COMMAND_L         &lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  [Note: The previous code uses the left-most command key. If you are interested in disabling the right-most command key, change each instance of codeCOMMAND_L/code with codeCOMMAND_R/code.]  Save the codeprivate.xml/code file. Return to the codeChange key/code tab. In the main list, under the coderemapping/code label, you should now see a codeDisable Minimize/code checkbox.  Check the checkbox, and you should now no longer be able to minimize your windows with the ⌘M shortcut. If you ever need to use the shortcut again, use Fn+⌘M, or simply uncheck the codeDisable Minimize/code checkbox.  <answer125628> You don't need to install any additional software.  ol liGo to strongSystem Preferences/strong  strongKeyboard/strong  strongShortcuts/strong  strongApp Shortcuts/strong/li liClick the img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xDPw7.png" alt="Plus Button" button below /li liEnter "strongMinimize/strong" into the strongMenu Title/strong text input field./li liAssign some bizzare key combination that you won't press by accident./li liClose the window to save the changes./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iqu86.png" alt="Keyboard Shortcuts Settings"  emI'm aware that this is not really "disabling it" but the result is effectively the same and without depending on 3rd party software./em  <answer186510> strongAlternative Solution/strong  I tried to follow setting my own shortcut like Machal has suggested. However it didn't work for me and just doubled the keybinding for minimize.   I did find, that setting something else to CMD+M worked perfectly:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/i9qCK.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer223745> I disabled Mission Control in "System PrefShortcuts TabMission Control" by unchecking checkbox Mission Control in the column and then kbdCmd-M/kbd would minimize any app open instead.  So, using "Keyboard Maestro" I creating a "Do Nothing" Group and assigned kbdCmd-M/kbd to "No Action" as in screenshot.  Worked like a charm!  <answer286710> h2macOS 10.12 (Sierra):/h2  The accepted answer didn't work for me.

The problem is that this merely overrides the command-m.  If you disable the selection here, then command-m will still cause the window to minimize.  I (and presumably others) want to do this so that they can use the command-m for other applications. <comment271321> Which screenshot are you referring to? <comment271925> This didn't work for me on El Capitan 10.11.2.  "Minimize" shows up under "All Applications" in the Keyboard Shortcuts list, assigned to Control-Option-Command-M, but that key combination doesn't minimize, and Command-M still does. <comment271927> This worked for me on El Capitan 10.11.2 <comment317542> Also works for me in macOS Sierra <comment323332> Can I suggest that you add to this response an over ride for the "Minimize All" command. <comment345991> Accepted answer needs an addendum: You will want to override both "Minimize" and "Minimise" (Chrome for instance wants that spelling).
