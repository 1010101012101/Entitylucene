If I block and then unblock someone, will I get their SMS sent while that person was blocked? <body> While using an iPhone 5, iOS 9, if I block someone, wait some time, and then unblock that person, will I receive SMS messages sent to me while that person was blocked?  <answer235103> No, the messages are blocked and they're not stored anywhere.   <answer278008> I don't know about the iphone but if i block someone on the google pixel phone and then unblock them, the sms text comes through eventually even if it was sent while blocked.  <comment349875> Welcome to Ask Different.
