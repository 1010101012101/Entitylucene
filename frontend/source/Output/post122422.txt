How to get Cmd-Tab (Mapped to Alt-Tab) in a Parallels Windows VM to cycle just Windows Apps? <body> I have a Windows VM running in Parallels and is working just fine. I have mapped Apple-kbd⌘ Cmd/kbd key to Windows-kbdAlt/kbd and Apple-kbd⌥ Opt/kbd to Windows-kbd⊞ Win/kbd.  When I press kbd⌘ Cmd/kbd-kbdTab/kbd - even in full screen mode - I cycle through all Apps running in both Windows and MacOS. How do I get it to just be Windows?  <answer170409> To disable the OS X system keyboard shortcuts while the focus is on your VM, just change the setting under Shortcuts labelled "Send OS X system shortcuts" to Always.  This will send all keystrokes emonly/em to the VM when it has the focus.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2TNG4.png" alt="Screenshot of keyboard settings"  <comment261568> This preference seems not to exist on Parallels 11 ... <comment308980> Correct, I dont see that option in Parallells 11 <comment328655> I don't see this in Parallels 12 either. I could really use something like this. <comment329615> I updated the screenshot and explanation to Parallels 12.  It's all still there, just the setting looks a little different. <comment330613> @jbandi Open "Parallels Desktop Control Center" (that's where all your VMs are lister), click on gear icon for your VM, click "Hardware Tab", click "Mouse and Keyboard" entry, click "Open Shortcut Preferences..." button.
