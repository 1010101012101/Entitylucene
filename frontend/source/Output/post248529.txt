see Wikipedia articles on a Map - free alternative to 5$ Viki app (Reader for Wikipedia) <body> I wish to see Wikipedia articles on a map. Explore local Wikipedia articles. The app Viki offers that feature.     NEARBY PLACES: Discover interesting Wikipedia articles about the area   around your location. Or explore any other spot in the world. It’s fun   with Viki’s unique map visualization.   Is there a free alternative? Maybe web based? I found with a search engine a OpenStreetMap project, but sadly not a ready-to-use product.  <answer248536> WikiLinks is free and shows articles about your surroundings. Although it doesn't have a map view, it lists articles about points of interest near your location sorted by distance. Also includes international results for languages you pick.
