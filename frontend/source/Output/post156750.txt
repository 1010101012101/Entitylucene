Apache running on Yosemite not working as expected <body> I plan to use both code/Library/Webserver/Documents/code and code~username/Sites//code. I have phpmyadmin folder in /Sites directory. If I go to   precodehttp://localhost/~username/phpmyadmin /code/pre  it works, but if I go to  precodehttp://localhost/phpmyadmin  /code/pre  I get "The requested URL /phpmyadmin/ was not found on this server.". I've reviewed the relevant files to make sure I enabled the relevant lines and such. Am I missing something obvious?  <answer156759> This question on Stack Overflow should be able to help get your localhost up and running again.  ul liGet localhost running on OS X Yosemite/li /ul  <answer188772> You've essentially set up two different sites here:  For codehttp://localhost/code your files are stored in code/Library/Webserver/Documents/code.  For codehttp://localhost/~username/code the files are stored in code~username/Sites/code  Therefore, anything you put in code~username/Sites/code will emonly/em be available when you go to codehttp://localhost/~username/code.  If you want to keep the two things separate, you'll need to put the "phpmyadmin" under code/Library/Webserver/Documents/code eminstead of/em codehttp://localhost/~username/code.  <comment184840> Well, I don't think this is exactly the answer. Its basically the same as the procedure that I was following wrt setting up Apache here: http://coolestguidesontheplanet.com/get-apache-mysql-php-phpmyadmin-working-osx-10-10-yosemite/ <comment223522> While this link may answer the question, it is better to include the essential parts of the answer here and provide the link for reference.
