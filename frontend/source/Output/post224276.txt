Use brew to check version of software online before installed <body> For example, when I run  precodebrew search octave /code/pre  It shows      homebrew/science/octave                Caskroom/cask/octave   I don't know which to install so I want to check the version of these programs. Is there any way to get it without installation.                    <answer224277> You can get information on each of the hits:  precodebrew info homebrew/science/octave brew info Caskroom/cask/octave /code/pre  In both cases, these may require you to "tap" the containing levels, but it gives you the command to run for each as needed.   From the first package information, you should get an info URL of https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-science/blob/master/octave.rb and then could inspect the source of that octave installation. Repeat for the cask and then you can decide or not to install one or the other.
