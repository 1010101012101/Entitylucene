Change Terminal.app's Default Shell to BASH <body> How can I change codeTerminal.app/code's default shell to codeBASH/code?  For some reason, my friend's Mac (10.6.6) defaults to using codeTCSH/code instead of codeBASH/code. The obvious remedy is to choose code/bin/bash/code as the command to open shells with (as below), but then it fails to load code.bashrc/code and code.bash_profile/code (even if I give a code--source/code or code--rcfile/code parameter). img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PPojq.png" alt="/bin/bash"  How can I switch it to use codebash/code the emright/em way?  <answer7985> By using codechsh/code from Terminal. It changes default shell for user. Alternatively you may setup Terminal to use code/bin/bash -l/code ... this will cause BASH to behave as login shell, i.e. it will read code.bash_profile/code.  <answer8003> Open System Preferences, select user and right click on its name. "Advanced options..." will appear. Change shell there. If you're die hard Apple user, you probably will have to enable right click first. Depending on your computer model, it can be done under Trackpad or Mouse Preferences.  <answer21794> As of Mac OS X Lion 10.7, Terminal will create login shells even if you choose a custom shell in Startup preferences. So your initial problem should no longer be an issue on Lion. (Although I recommend setting the shell via System Preferences to ensure it's set for the user account and not just for the Terminal application.)  <comment8622> No go for `chsh`; it still gave me `tcsh` as the default shell. However, `/bin/bash -l` does work. I'd like to hear other opinions before I accept it as the _right_ answer, thought. <comment8674> This is most likely the best way to do it. Easy, permanent, and doesn't conflict with anything else. <comment8681> Great. I didn't know about this. I'm coming from unix word where chsh is the way to go, but I would surely recommend using built-in Mac OS X tool instead. <comment8718> You can always control click instead of right click, which is the traditional way to access context menus. <comment8733> @Antal S-Z thanks for this to know <comment23987> Re "For some reasonâ€¦": The default shell used to be tcsh. Now it's bash, but existing user accounts are not changed when upgrading to a newer Mac OS X. Users with older accounts will need to switch shells themselves. <comment37765> I don't see the 'user' icon in System Preferences <comment39870> I had to "Click the lock to make changes" in order to coerce the context menu to reveal itself. This was on Lion.
