What iOS browsers support Firefox Sync? <body> My Mom wants to be able to use Firefox Sync to sync her bookmarks between her laptop and her iPad. What browsers support Firefox Sync?  <answer43045> How about Firefox Home? It's not a browser but you can sync your bookmark, and open them via Safari.  <answer43056> I only know of iLunascape (FREE) and 360 Web ($0.99) to support Firefox Sync.  <answer46734> The best browser for this is Mercury Browser (app store link). It supports full Firefox browser syncing. There is a .99 upgrade to remove ads.br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/T5mH7.jpg" alt="Mercury Browser"  <answer135122> Now Mercury Browser not support Firefox Sync. Foxbrowser is a good alternative.

Thanks though!
