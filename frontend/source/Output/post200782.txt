Text shorcuts with @ symbols are not working in OS X <body> On my iPhone, I've setup text shortcuts that allow me to quickly enter email addresses. For example, typing codex@g/code for example might resolve to codexyz@gmail.com/code.  These shortcuts have been synced to my Mac, along with all my other devices, but it seems that having an code@/code symbol as part of the shortcut, means they don't work in OS X (running Yosemite right now).  I have done the same for domains, so codegoogle/code might resolve to codehttp://www.google.com/code, and that works.  I could always create an OS X friendly shortcut, but what I'd really like to know is if it's possible to get the code@/code symbol to work in OS X as a shortcut?  <comment242063> Interesting. I have 2 that work on Yosemite. Do you have instances where they don't work? <comment242064> I've tried in the Notes app, the Twitter widget in notification centre and in Chrome. Shortcuts without the @ symbol work in all those places. <comment242065> Try recreating them on your Mac instead of the phone. See if that works. <comment242066> I tried that before posting up, just didn't work. At first I thought they hadn't even synced but they had and I can configure them on both my iOS and OS X devices. <comment242068> I can't duplicate.  I made a shortcut on my iPhone (z@e) which expands to: xyz@example.com every time on my Mac running Yosemite.  Hope you find a solution. Cheers <comment242069> Expands in OS X? <comment242070> Yup.  In Notes and even here: xyz@example.com (works after hitting space bar) <comment242113> I didn't think Chrome supported expansion. Try Safari
