Enlarging or reducing desktop view and making paragraphs <body> ol liI have a Facebook friend who is stating my posts appear huge to her. I use a pc and had thought she had one too. So with little known I told her how to make the text she was seeing smaller by using the Control and - keys. She said it didn't work./li liShe runs all her text together on Facebook so I asked her if she could put paragraph breaks in so I might be able to read her extreme long messages. I use Shift and Enter on my pc./li /ol  So how do I tell her how to do this on her Mac?  <answer265503> It should be the same in the Mac, you can also tell her to zoom in with the trackpad  But this looks to be a problem with Facebook itself, according to this reddit post some posts appear bigger than others because of the number of characters. If they have 35 characters or less, the font size is bigger.  <answer265504> On a Mac you would typically use the kbdCommand/kbd key instead of the  kbdControl/kbd key when dealing with many common text keyboard shortcuts.  In terms of the kbdShift/kbd+kbdEnter/kbd keyboard shortcut, that should still work on a Mac.  However, since you're talking about Facebook, it could also be a Facebook formatting issue or related to the specific browser she's using as well.
