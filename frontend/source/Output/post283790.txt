MacBook Pro crash recovery <body> I have problem with my MacBook Pro 2015 (i7, 16 GB RAM). It crashes when I open my session or enter in recovery mode. I did a SMC and NPRAM reset but no improvement.  Internet recovery by Apple doesn't work either, after downloading the recovery from Internet and loading the progress bar stops at 1/10.  Have you idea? RAM issue? I never opened it.  <answer283856> Troubleshooting is a process of elimination and can require some patience.  The first thing I would do is try running Apple Diagnostics to test your hardware.   strongRun Apple Diagnostics/strong  Follow the steps below to run Apple Diagnostics:  ol liFully shut down your Mac/li liEnsure you have no external hardware (e.g. keyboard, mouse, display, printer, portable hard drive, etc) connected/li liRestart your Mac/li liImmediately press the kbdD/kbd key and strongkeep it down/strong until you see the Diagnostics screen appear/li liWait for Diagnostics to finish (this typically only takes a few minutes)/li liOnce complete, one of two things will appear on the screen:  ul lia emNo issues found/em message/li lia brief description of any errors found plus further instructions/li /ul/li liIf the diagnostics test does find errors, take a note of what they are/li /ol  strongNote:/strong If pressing and holding the kbdD/kbd key at Step 3 doesn't work, start again at Step 1 and, at Step 4 press and hold both the kbdOption/kbdkbdD/kbd keys instead. This will try and run diagnostics from the internet instead, so you will need to allow more time for it to complete.   Regardless, take a note of what happens and let me know how you went. Then we can proceed with further troubleshooting.  <comment357981> Nothing wrong in diagnostic mode.
