Windows 8 Resolution Problems <body> I just installed Windows 8 on my ManBook Pro Retina 15" and I am having some problems. Scince the default resolution looks bad, I set the Resolution to 2880x1800, but this made everything small. I tried scaling, and set that to 200%, but now third-party apps look unbearable. For MacOSX I know there is a solution called Retinizer, but that aplication does not support Windows. Is there anyway I can have everything at a reasonable size, but at the same time having everything look good?
