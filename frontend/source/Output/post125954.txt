How to have Safari restore form data? <body> I want to have Safari restore form data when restoring my session. This should be native, but Safari does not have this — yet.  The extension Lazarus looks great. But it does not work.  I have also looked at an extension named Form Autosave. But it is crappy.  I have Safari 7 on Mac OS X Mavericks.  <comment159940> Argh, just noticed that Lazarus isn't working since the upgrade to Mavericks.  It was truly a lifesaver (and worked quite well). <comment246771> The link in the original question above… {http://canisbos.com/formsaver} …is broken.
