Is it possible to set the unlock passcode with configurator profiles? <body> I'm managing a half dozen devices with Configurator. I'd like to set the unlock passcode on all of the devices to codefriend/code. Is this possible using profiles or some other method in Configurator? If so, how?  I can't seem to figure out how, and my Google-Fu isn't giving me answers (too many wifi answers).  <answer177144> Not to my knowledge; You can mandate a passcode has to be in use, but you cannot dictate what that passcode is.
