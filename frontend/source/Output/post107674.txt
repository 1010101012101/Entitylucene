How can I set a keyboard shortcut that includes the backspace key? <body> My question is in the title: does OS X allow to set a shortcut with backspace, like  kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdOption ⌥/kbd+kbdCommand ⌘/kbd+kbdbackspace/kbd (in my case to an Automator service)?   strongEdit/strong:br You might think "Try it yourself"; well, I did it. In System Preferences → Keyboard → Shortcuts, I tried to add this shortcut to my service and it doesn't work. The problem seems to be with backspace. kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdOption ⌥/kbd+kbdCommand ⌘/kbd+kbdm/kbd works well.  Does anybody know a workaround that allows me to use the kbdbackspace/kbd key in a keyboard shortcut?  <answer108196> While it's not free, Keyboard Maestro will solve your problem.  Here's a very simple example: Just set the Hot Key to ⌘Delete (by pressing ⌘+⌦) and assign a menu item for it to activate. You can also specify the applications that the shortcut will work in, so you can reuse the trigger.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gehgN.png" alt="Keyboard Maestro Macro"  Of course, given that's it's a emvery/em powerful macro program, you can set it to do much more complicated tasks—from running Applescripts to manipulating Markdown.  <answer108248> To change the shortcut of a service, run codeplutil -convert xml1 ~/Library/Preferences/pbs.plist/code, open the plist, and change for example  precode&lt;key&gt;(null) - Some Service - runWorkflowAsService&lt;/key&gt; &lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;key_equivalent&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;@~a&lt;/string&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; /code/pre  to  precode&lt;key&gt;(null) - Some Service - runWorkflowAsService&lt;/key&gt; &lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;key_equivalent&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;@~&amp;#x8;&lt;/string&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; /code/pre  Then restart to apply the changes.  @ is command, ~ is option, and &amp;#x8; is delete (Windows backspace). Forward delete (Windows delete) would be &amp;#x7f;. The shortcut strings use the same format as in DefaultKeyBinding.dict.  To change a global shortcut set in the App Shortcuts section, run codeplutil -convert xml1 ~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist/code, open the plist, and change for example  precode&lt;key&gt;Some Menu Name&lt;/key&gt; &lt;string&gt;~@a&lt;/string&gt; /code/pre  to  precode&lt;key&gt;Some Menu Name&lt;/key&gt; &lt;string&gt;~@&amp;#x8;&lt;/string&gt; /code/pre  Then quit and reopen applications to apply the changes.  Application-specific shortcuts are stored in ~/Library/Preferences/*.plist and ~/Library/Containers/*/Data/Library/Preferences/*.plist.  <answer160157> ul liStep 1 - get karabiner (if it's not already on your mac, which it might be). /li liStep 2 - open Karabiner/li liStep 3 - go to "change backslash key"/li liStep 4 - click "change backslash to forward delete / + (Fn+backslash to backslash"/li liStep 5 - close window./li /ul  This makes the backslash key the delete key.  I never use backslash, so it works great for me. Hope this helps.   <comment126255> If you want, you can add your findings as an answer to keep the site organised. <comment126256> Actually my question was to know if there was maybe a work around for this. <comment126259> Ah sorry, I misunderstood. I thought you just wanted to know if the shortcut could include the backspace key or not. <comment250287> I don't know if yosemite treats this file differently, or if my issue is specific to chrome, but I cannot get this to work.  Saving the file with the new key binding doesn't propagate to the keyboard shortcut preferences, nor does it show up in chrome's menu.  A warning to hotkey-heavy folks like myself, I have found a lot of difficulty trying to customize my keyboard shortcuts throughout OSX (coming from windows & linux).  Although it seems as though there is a lot of opportunity for fine-grained customization, I'm finding a ton of bugs within OSX keybindings as a whole.
