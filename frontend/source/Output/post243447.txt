WiFi network issues on El Capitan <body> I know similar questions have been asked quite a few times, but my problem seems to be subtly different and I'm really hoping there is a different answer.  I've got a work MBP running El Capitan. When I'm on the wired network at work, it's absolutely fine. When I'm at home on the WiFi, it's sometimes absolutely fine and sometimes it's awful. When it's not working well, I can reboot and it will be fine again for a week or so, and then something will happen and it will get awful again.  When things go wrong, the WiFi connection between the MBP and the router is fine. There is no problem there. The problem is in the actual networking. I can do a ping to the router IP itself, and it will go through periods of perfect responses and periods of Request Timeout. I've included a link to a Pastebin with the ping output rather than including it here purely because of the size of it.  I've seen suggestions of deleting the networking system preferences and having them get recreated on reboot. I'm loathe to do this because there are also preferences for the work networks - VPN and secured WiFi - that I can't easily reproduce. As such, I'm hoping that somebody can suggest something else that might help.  Ping output: http://pastebin.com/YWn3WHnA  <comment315396> It seems to be interferences. Do you get the same result from another device? Have you tried to move the Mac closer to the access point? You should try to scan wireless networks around you and pay particularly attention the channels they use, then make sure yours is using a different one. <comment315400> I only get out on macbook, but it is the only apple device we have. Our android phones and tablets, and my wife's windows laptop are all fine. I also get the problem on the 2G, 5G and the open guest network from our house router, but not from using my phone as a hotspot, and not from the WiFi at work...
