Display contrast change when playing media <body> I have a weird issue with my MacBook Pro that I bought about 3 weeks ago.   I noticed that when I start playing VLC player or even when opening up certain websites that the color saturation seems to automatically change on the machine. I don't think that this is related to the "automatically adjust brightness" in the system preferences because I disabled that and the issue remains.   Does anyone know why the color saturation seems to change when I start playing media? For example, the grey at the top of windows seems to change to a very pale blue.  <comment71913> I have the same issue! But itâ€™s not just when playing media. It happens with any dark colour. After I move my mouse over said colour or scroll a page, the blacks lose some saturation. This is very localised to only the dark colours, like the black bar over this page. <comment76210> Does it do this when the graphics card switches? (Use gfxCardStatus to see when that happens.)
