Macbook wake from sleep ctrl key to activate keyboard <body> I have a really annoying problem with my 2011 13" Macbook Pro running 10.6.8.  Whenever I open the lid after it's been to sleep the keyboard seems to be in a mode where it thinks the Ctrl key is pressed down. This means that, at the login screen, I can't type in my password.  I can press the Ctrl key and it switches back to the standard keyboard mode, so it's not broken, per se.  Is this some mode that I have enabled by mistake? I've been into the preferences and things like Sticky Keys are disabled... would really like to get this solved!  Thanks!
