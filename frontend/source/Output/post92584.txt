Keyboard shortcut to switch between Songs, Albums, Artists, Genres, Videos, Playlists in iTunes? <body> I wasn’t able to find keyboard shortcuts for switching between Songs, Albums, Artists, Genres, Videos, Playlists in iTunes. This is the only thing that is missing in order to have a complete keyboard experience.  Are there any shortcuts for this? And if not, can they be created and how?  <answer92588> You could assign shortcuts to scripts like this:  precodetell application "System Events" to tell window 1 of process "iTunes"     if exists radio button 4 of radio group 1 of splitter group 1 then         click radio button 4 of radio group 1 of splitter group 1     else -- if the sidebar is not shown         click radio button 4 of radio group 1     end if end tell /code/pre    precodetell application "iTunes"     set view of browser window 1 to user playlist "Music" end tell tell application "System Events" to tell window 1 of process "iTunes"     if exists radio button 4 of radio group 1 of splitter group 1 then         click radio button 4 of radio group 1 of splitter group 1     else         click radio button 4 of radio group 1     end if end tell /code/pre    precodetell application "iTunes"     set view of browser window 1 to (get user playlist 1 where special kind is none) end tell /code/pre  <comment109612> Thanks.  The first two scripts output the following error, when executed in iTunes:  Error Number:System Events got an error: Can’t get radio group 1 of window 1 of process "iTunes". Invalid index. -1719  The 3rd one is working as specified.  Do you have any idea how to make the others work? <comment109613> They didn't work when the sidebar was shown, but I edited the answer. <comment109615> I tried it again, with the sidebar turned on and off, but it turned out the same:   Error Number:System Events got an error: Can’t get radio group 1 of window 1 of process "iTunes". Invalid index. -1719   (iTunes version 11.0.4.) <comment109616> If it was the first script, it's just meant to click the fourth tab in the bar at the top. It doesn't work if the bar at the top doesn't exist. <comment109618> The tabs are present all the time 100%. Just in case we talk about different group of tabs I posted a [screenshot](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s2/sh/10cf06f8-3d26-4918-852d-2d38ea4062a6/2d356ecdd1442a04b6418bf80e18a8c8).  I tried the 1st and 2nd script, sidebar on and off, but to no avail. The 3rd one is working properly.
