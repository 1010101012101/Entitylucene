In AppleScript when entering password, is a click required <body> I'm writing an AppleScript to toggle on/off a VPN connection for a computer.  I have things more or less working, however, I have to click on the password prompt dialog in order for the script to enter my password.  Here is the code block to put the password in, I added the codereopen/code and codeactivate/code commands because I emthought/em they would bring the window to focus.  precode-- Enter the password now! tell application "System Events"     tell process "SecurityAgent"         reopen         activate         set value of text field 2 of window 1 to myPass         click button 2 of window 1     end tell end tell /code/pre  Is there something simple I'm missing?  hr  h3UPDATE/h3  Ok Update - Actually it looks like it IS entering the password but its after maybe a 6 second delay or something like that.  I'm no sure if that changes the question  <answer192499> Try adding this to your code:  precodeset first responder to text field 2 of window 1 /code/pre  This should bring focus to the text field.  For reference, see this post on MacScripter  <answer192522> precodetell application "System Events" to tell process "SecurityAgent" to Â¬ set frontmost to true /code/pre
