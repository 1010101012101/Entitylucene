iOS8 how can I reduce the amount of system alert dialogs that I'm being asked? <body> Since upgrading to iOS8 I'm growing increasingly frustrated with the number of system dialogs that iOS randomly asks me.   ul lilocation in background/li liset up family sharing/li lianother email address added to another device/li lietc, etc, etc./li /ul  I find it really frustrating when I reach for my phone to take a picture and there's an alert dialogue sitting on top of the screen, it feels like I'm interacting with Windows 95.   strongIs there a way to reduce amount of popups and alert dialogues that iOS8 asks the user?/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ywjYN.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer157214> These popups are the base of the privacy features of iOS.
