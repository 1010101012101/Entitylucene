How do I convert my Photos library to actual files and folders with no quality loss? <body> I spent a lot of time organizing my iPhoto Library with Events. Now, my events have been converted to "Folders" in the new Apple Photos system. I moved them up a level (making them emAlbums/em), and I've been using this kind of structure to keep my photos stored in different sets for several months. Now, I'd like to convert my Photo Library to a file-and-folder structure, so that I can move to a different program, such as strongemShotWell/em/strong for Ubuntu. Unfortunately, it seems that they have been "converted" to a new Apple proprietary format (strong.photolibrary/strong). Is there any way I can automate the creation of a folder structure like this:  precodePhotos Library/Example_Album/IMG_0001.jpeg /code/pre  Without losing any quality?  Here is what I tried:  ul liRight-clicking onto Library and selecting "Show Package Contents": files seem to be in a wrong structure/li liDropping all Albums from Photos to Desktop: does not export files with correct "Albums" folders/li liDownloading strongPhotosToDisk/strong from here: requires a $12.95 purchase, which is not acceptable./li /ul  emHelp will be much appreciated!/em  <answer234530> At the end, the only solution to this was to download Photos-to-Disk Software I mentioned above. It worked perfectly, creating the Folder Structure I needed. I recommend to do the same guys, if for some reason you have this issue.  <answer268522> It's already there in that form.  It's just a question of finding it, and then copying it.  ol liGo to your Pictures folder/li liIn that find the Photos Library probably called "Photos 3 Library"/li liRight click, or control click, on Photos 3 Library and pick Show Package Contents.  Do not alter, move or delete anything in here./li liYour photo masters are all in the directory Masters in a hierarchical date structure./li liRight/control click on Masters to find out how big it is.  You're going to need that much space./li liCopy the whole folder (press alt and then drag it) to somewhere outside of the library, anywhere you want./li /ol  Et voila.  <comment286638> .photolibrary isn't a "proprietary format," it is rather a bundle or package as you've discovered. It contains the original unaltered photos and metadata. The masters folder would have your photos, organized by date. <comment286639> And how would I export my files with the structure I created within the program? That information is stored in a proprietary format <comment286641> Have you added new photos to Photos since converting? <comment286643> Yes. I also changed something in the albums. I can't go back to iPhoto Library. If there's no way at all, I will have to buy that program, delete the Photo Library and never use Apple software again. I'm very disappointed. <comment286664> Nothing about Photos advertises a "folder and file" hierarchy. An album is an abstraction in Photosâ€¦a single photo can appear in multiple albums. Think about this: how much is your time worth, and how much time are you willing to spend researching this, and how good is that $13 looking? If you want to let Apple's failure to consider how you wished their software would work reason to swear off the company altogether, godspeed--it's really no difference to us. We're here for you if have any other questions. <comment337433> But it's not organized in albums
