Frequently VS Recently Used Emoji's? <body> My iPhone used to show me my strongfrequently/strong used Emojis, which was super helpful. I guess after one of the updates though, my phone started showing me my strongrecently/strong used Emojis instead. It can be helpful but I would like to see my frequent ones instead, so is there a way to switch that? Or am I stuck with recently used?  <comment274493> Are  you now on 9.2.1?   My 9.2 still says Frequently.
