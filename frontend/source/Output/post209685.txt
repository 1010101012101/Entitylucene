Is it possible to import iPhone photos with corresponding .AAE files to Photos on the Mac? <body> I'm transitioning to using Photos.app on both iOS and OS X - with the intention to use emiCloud Photo Library/em...  Before making this change I had to move a bunch of photos off an iPhone to free up space. I did so using emImage Capture/em on the Mac - and I've ended up with code.JPG/codes paired with code.AAE/codes (the latter, as I understand it, containing the image edits).  (So, I moved the photos off the iPhone to a folder on a Mac, duplicated on external disk, did a back up, then deleted the images on the iPhone)  I've read this Q&amp;A with tells of a method to use a python script to apply of the filters to the corresponding images.  What I'd like to know: is it possible to import both the code.JPG/code files and code.AAE/code files so that the original image is still available in Photos? E.g. so that the emrevert/em option would still be available...  <answer222331> best way to do this is via AirDrop, its super fast and doesn't require a internet connection (bluetooth and WIFI need to be switched on though). Works with iPhone5 or up, maybe 4S as well but i didn't try.   https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201463
