Applescript to delete iMessages from Messages app <body> I have an Applescript that sends myself and colleagues iMessages when certain events happen. Some times hundreds of iMessages are sent in a short space of time to lots of people and the Messages app fills up pretty quick.  Is there an Applescript I can run that deletes conversations from the Messages app?   (It can be a blanket 'nuke all messages', I'm not worried about keeping the history on this particular computer.)  <answer97044> Can you create a Folder Action to empty the ~/Library/Messages folder at intervals?
