Control Option Command C shortcut not working? <body> I have a services shortcut set to Control+Option+Command+C, which I frequently use. It suddenly stopped working and I'm not sure why. There is no warning of a conflict, and I've searched through all the currently set shortcuts and nothing else is set to use this set of keys. If I set the shortcut to use any of the surrounding letters of C (e.g. X) with all the same modifiers it works. If I use a different set of modifiers (e.g. Control+Command+C) it works. This set of keys doesn't work with other services either, so it's not just this service. I've tested multiple applications in focus when the shortcut is used, so I doubt it's specific to the application in focus. Any suggestions as to what might be going on and how to fix it? Thanks!  strongUpdate:/strong The same thing happens when replacing codeC/code with codeL/code. If anyone else could comment whether these combination of keys have the same problem on their device, that would at least suggest whether it's a general problem or just specific to some configuration on my machine. I was using El Capitan when I posted the question, but I'm currently using Sierra v10.12 and the problem still exists.
