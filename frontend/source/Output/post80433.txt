How do I open a file from TextEdit on MacOSX? <body> How do I create a link in TextEdit on MacOSX that will let me open an external application?  <answer80438> Doing strongTextField / Edition / Edit Link/strong (strongAdd Link/strong if you've got any text selected)or kbdCommand/kbd+kbdK/kbd, will let you add an emHyperlink/em.  Typing codefile:///code before the application's file path will give you a embluish/em clickable text, which, on click, will open the file path. Here's how it should look like:  codefile:///Applications/NameOfTheApplication.app/code  It strongwon't/strong open the Application, but will open a new emFinder/em window with the item already selected.   <comment92825> "External" as in same hard disk or volume? <comment93370> Shame you can't actually open an application but this does help. <comment93371> Yes, that's not clear. I just meant another application - i.e. not another copy of TextEdit. Nothing to do with hard disk or volume.
