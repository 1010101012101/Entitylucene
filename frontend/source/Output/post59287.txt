How to uninstall deprecated Unsubscribe plugin from Mail.app? <body> I used the Unsubscribe plugin for Mail.app, but it is now a part of TrustedID (http://www.unsubscribe.com/), so now I can't use it anymore and want to remove it.  When I want to uninstall the plugin from inside the Mail.app preferences, nothing happens when I hit the button codeRemove Unsubscribe Plugin/code. There's nothing in /Users/emMyUserName/em/Library/Mail/Bundles that looks like the Unsubscribe plugin.  How to uninstall deprecated Unsubscribe plugin from Mail.app?  <answer59354> It's not in your Home folder. Look in the Library folder on the main level of your hard drive. ([Macintosh HD/Library/Mail/Bundles] Replace "Macintosh HD" with the name of your hard drive.)  <answer86117> UnsubMailPluginMail App for OS X is a leftover from a free program which later switched to become a user pay software. The program vanished but the plugin stayed to pop up and annoy you.  To remove it:  ol liOpen your Finder window./li liProceed to the codeGo/code menu./li liThen down to codeGo to Folder.../code./li liThen in the window delete existing wording and type in code/Library/Mail//code./li /ol  When the folder opens, locate the plugin and move it to Trash.  <comment68394> No, the folder in the main Library is empty. <comment99361> Reformatting this as a series of discreet steps (1, 2, 3...) would make it easier to read.
