very slow boot disk selector menu, except directly after NVRAM reset <body> I fiddle with linux on my 13 inch recent macbook and I suspect that is what caused this.  I have done complete internet recoveries of OSX and removed linux.  But everything before the OS in the case of linux or things like using the boot disk selector is extremely slow. I could barely even type in my password for the internet recovery.  However, I did notice that the boot disk selector works fine if I attempt to use it directly after resetting the NVRAM. Subsequent attempts are extremely slow again. For example, in the boot disk selector menu, I could press the left arrow to select a different disk and have to wait ~30 seconds before the next drive is selected. But after that selection, and after the OS is booted, everything works normally.  I have reset the SMC too, with no improvement, though, it gives no indication if it actually occurred.  What is going on?
