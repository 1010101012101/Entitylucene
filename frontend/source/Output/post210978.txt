My iPhone 5 isn't downloading apps <body> There are a few apps that I found online that I'm trying to download, but my phone isn't letting me. When I click the link and it brings me to the app store, I click the "get" button, and then the "install" button, but instead of recognizing that, it just reloads and I have to click it again. I've tried it many times with many different apps, but it just keeps reloading until I give up. It didn't even give me an error message. I know I have plenty of storage, so that isn't the problem. Thank you for any insight.  <answer210979> There is a service disruption affecting the all iTunes stores.
