Swapping desktops (unintentionally) on Mavericks <body> I am using OSX Mavericks 10.9.2 and I have 4 desktops that I use in my daily workflow. From time to time Desktop 2 and Desktop 3 switch places and I cannot figure why. Probably when moving from desktop to desktop (sometimes I use 3 finger swap and sometimes Control^#) I activate some shortcut.   Does anybody what is shortcut for swapping desktops or some other explanation for this? And how to disable it :)  Thanks  <comment147697> Does http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/104900/is-there-any-way-to-save-the-order-of-spaces-in-mission-control help (assuming you mean Spaces when you say Desktop)? <comment147698> @patrix It does speak on same topic but it does not help. Since I have already made my assignment to specific desktop (space) all works as intended. Until desktops swap places. I am new to Mac so in Mission Control I see name 'Desktop 1', 'Desktop 2' ... probably older alias is Space so I think we mean the same thing. <comment147699> Have a look at http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/104912/9058, is the 2nd option set or unset on your Mac? <comment147712> Thank you! This is solution, if you like you can answer and I will accept. I would not mark it as duplicate since it much more "google-able" in current form. <comment147714> Closing will keep it indexed by Google and reference the other question as well.
