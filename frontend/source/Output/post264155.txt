Using too much of Hotspot hurts the iPad? <body> I have a iPad mini2 em(cellular)/em. Recently my modem has been broken and to use the internet via my laptop I use a personal hotspot connection. I mean I connect to my ipad by my laptop for using the internet.  As I've mentioned in the title of my question, I do that too much. For example 10 hours per day. Now I want to know, should I stop doing that? would it hurts my ipad?   You know, I feel the connection has slowed recently, I mean when I turn personal hotspot on in my ipad, it takes 1 min to my laptop find it and connect to it. I think that happened faster already.  <answer264196>    Should I stop doing that?   The only reason you may want to stop is to avoid going over your cellular data limit (if any).     Will it hurt my iPad?   No, this wont "hurt" your iPad, however it's a process that requires the iPad to work a bit harder than normal, meaning you can expect these while you are using the hotspot:  ul liShorter battery life for the iPad/li liSlower Performance on the iPad/li liSlower internet speeds than usual for all devices/li /ul  <comment331061> Does your cellular provider throttle your data speeds after you've used a certain amount of data?  Even "unlimited" plans can do this, there is no general answer to this question it's very specific to your carrier and plan.
