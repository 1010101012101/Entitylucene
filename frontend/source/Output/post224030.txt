Copy not possible from ssd to another ssd <body> We want to move 30GB of data located on a 128GB ssd to another 120gb ssd. This is not possible as disk utility says that /dev/disk2s2 doesn't have enough space.  The data we want to copy is os x itself, and some programs used in the store.  Can this be solved by partitioning the 128gb ssd and than copy the partition? Or is the a command line way to achieve this?  strongupdate/strong At this time, we partitioned the 128ssd. We just started copying, fingers crossed.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fhYCA.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer224034> h2Remote Synchronisation: codersync/code/h2  Consider using OS X's strongTerminal.app/strong and included codersync/code command line tool to safely copy the data:  precodesudo rsync -vaE --progress /Volumes/SourceName /Volumes/DestinationName /code/pre  See Fastest and safest way to copy massive data from one external drive to another for how this command works and what each section means.
