Strange looking mouse pointer with squiggles and 24 <body> I opened up my macbook this morning (resumed from sleep) and found that my mouse pointer looked like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pe8bV.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  If I hovered over a button, the pointer part would change to the little hand, but the squiggles and the 24 stayed in place.  Likewise when I tried to take a screenshot, the camera icon would show but still the squiggles and 24 behind it.  (Of course, you can't take a screenshot of the mouse pointer, hence the photo.)  After a restart, the issue is gone.  What could have caused this?  OSX 10.7.5
