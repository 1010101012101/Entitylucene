How to prevent MacBook Pro from sleeping with turned off external display? <body> I have two displays connected to my MacBook Pro Retina 2015, running 10.10. It is connected to power, so it will not sleep once I close the lid.   However, if I am doing long during calculations over night I want to power off the external displays. This is not possible, since as soon as I shut down the last display the system stops to calculations, compression tasks etc.  Is there a way to keep OS X awake on a power book with a closed lid and turned off displays while connected to power?  <answer214014> ol liMove all windows from your external displays to the mbp's display/li liRemove your display connector/s/li liVoila, It works!/li /ol  If it doesnt work, Try Resetting the SMC and PRAM/NVRAM. Google about how to do that..
