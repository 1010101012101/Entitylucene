Should I reinstall the operating system on Mac Book Pro if I get lots of crashes? <body> I'm running OS X Yosemite 10.10.2 on my Mac Book Pro Retina 15" early 2013 and find that starting back around Mavericks, my Adobe Acrobat Pro X and now XI crashes frequently.  Sometimes with Yosemite, I also see the finder crashing.  I'm not seeing issues with other applications.  I visited the genius bar today and the person there suggested to re-image my computer.  I'm hesitant to do this because it is a big time commitment and I'm not convinced it will resolve the issue.  I would have to back up everything and deactivate all my software, re-image, and then reinstall all my software.  I imagine this would take around 5 hours to complete all those steps.  I report the crash to apple each time it occurs, but not sure that has any effect, as I've been reporting for a long time now, and it still persists.  Is this likely a corruption of the operating system that a reinstall would fix or is this just a bug that would return upon re-image?  If it is a corruption of the OS, is there any other way to repair without doing a clean install that would take me many hours?

report here, which is too big to include in this question.  hr  I don't have a reliable way to cause either the Finder or Acrobat to crash.  The Finder crashes are much rarer.  For Acrobat, I do notice a couple patterns:  ol liCrashes sometimes occur just after saving the document (this is the case for the above crash report)./li liCrashes sometimes occur related to adding text to the document via the codeAdd Text/code tool under Content Editing./li /ol  In either case, it seems that mouse movements might trigger the issue and thus I think I might be reducing the probability of crashing by avoiding mouse movements for a bit after either of the above two actions.  hr  Here is the Etre Check report for my system.  <answer181575> I wouldn't reinstall an operating system because one application is misbehaving. That doesn't really make any sense. This could just be a bug in Adobe's software. If there is a way to report bugs to Adobe I'd try that, I'm sure they'll be more interested in faults in their own software than Apple will be in what is to them third-party software.  Anyway.  The first thing I'd do is make sure I had all the latest updates installed. This could be a bug that someone has already reported and Adobe have fixed. It looks like you do have the latest version of Adobe Acrobat XI though.  The second thing I'd do is I would try the application within a new account. As you use an application is creates all kind of settings, cache, etc files throughout your account. Create a new account, which will essentially be starting from scratch without these files and see if it works reliably there without crashing. If it does then the case of the crashes are something within your own account.  The third thing would be to try cleaning up after the application in your own account. So locate all the files that Adobe Acrobat has created within your account and either delete or temporarily rename them (caches under /User/USERNAME/Library/Caches/Adobe..., preferences under /User/USERNAME/Library/Preferences, perhaps other files in something like /User/USERNAME/Library/Adobe, etc). And then try the application again. You can try this a step at a time, to try to identify which is causing the problem.  If there are a serious of steps you follow that reliably cause the application to crash, please update your question and we might be able to give a more specific answer.  <answer181615> Besides the advice already given, have a good look at your fonts; a wonky font can cause Acrobat to misbehave.  There is also an utility available from Adobe (no, I don't have the link available right now), which does a deep cleaning of everything Acrobat; you might therefore consider running that tool and reinstall Acrobat.  <comment216050> I've edited the question to add more context as to what seems to trigger the crashes in Adobe.  The Finder crashes are rarer and I have not come up with any noticed patterns. <comment216059> Do you use an Apple mouse or a third party? It might also help to run [EtreCheck](http://www.etresoft.com/etrecheck) on your Mac, then paste the results into a [Gist](https://gist.github.com) and add a link to the Gist in your question. It could be a third party extension or plugin that is loading itself into Adobe Acrobat that is causing the crashes. EtreCheck will tell us the extensions/plugins/etc that are running on your Mac. <comment216065> @AlistairMcMillan I've added the requested Etre Check report.  I use the Apple mouse. <comment216222> I would agree with Alistair. It is likely an Acrobat issue. yes you could re-image the Mac and it should fix it but with a little more investigating or at the very least ripping anything associated with Adobe off your system (prefs, cache, etc.) should get you the desired result without the pain of a re-image
