Updating OS X to NOT the latest version <body> I have a macbook that is running OS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion); for various compatibility-related reasons I would like to upgrade the system, but emnot/em to El Capitan. Yosemite (OS X 10.10) would be dandy. The App Store, of course, only offers an upgrade to El Capitan, currently the newest OS X version.  I know that it is possible to restore a computer to the OS it had prior to an upgrade, but is it possible to upgrade to a (never-seen before) OS version that is not the latest available?  strongEdit:/strong This question is related (but only if Yosemite had been downloaded via the App Store in the past).  <answer216391> Only if you know someone who has it in their App Store Purchase History who would be willing to download it for you.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YB0qJ.png" alt="enter image description here"  Drop it in your Applications folder &amp; run it; it will directly update to 10.10.5, the latest version.  Alternatively, if you have a Family Sharing account with anyone who has it in their history, you could download it directly.  <comment261458> In the future, I'd recommend downloading each update, but not installing it. Instead, quit the installer and wait until you are ready. If you don't want it left on your HD, you can redownload it from the App Store, even if there's a new version. <comment261460> I'll ask around, thanks. <comment261461> Good idea. I actually always download them & move to another drive. I have all OSes back to at least Tiger. [some early ones as ISOs.] <comment261469> @Tetsujin me too. Helps if you need to work on an old Mac.
