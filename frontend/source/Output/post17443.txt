Delete Mails in Mac Mail without Trash <body> How can I delete an email in Mac Mail instantly without moving it to the trash? I don't want to look at the spam crap twice :-)  strongUPDATE/strong: I want to do this because I have some very old mails in my trash I don't want to delete at the moment (or decide what to do with). So I cannot delete my whole trash. But to avoid the trash becoming bigger and bigger I want to delete spam etc. without moving to trash...  <answer17472> Why look in the trash at all? Just set your Trash to automatically delete messages after a day. You can do that in the Accounts pane of preferences:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pdTFa.png" alt="Accounts pane"  <answer17474> Delete the message: kbd⌘/kbdkbd⌫/kbd  Then empty the trash: kbd⇧/kbdkbd⌘/kbdkbd⌫/kbd  <answer56245> A very old tip (2006) from MacWorld suggests using kbd⌘ Command/kbd+kbdX/kbd to cut the messages and then just copying some text to wipe the clipboard. This seems to work, but Mail.app tries to copy the contents of those emails to memory - so probably not very useful for lots of mails with attachments.  <answer128508> You can delete emails and bypass the trash using  kbd⌥ Option/kbd + kbd⌫ Backspace/kbd  (Successfully tested with OS X 10.9 (Mavericks). Could work with older versions, too.)  hr  If you want to delete emails that are strongalready in trash/strong it is enough to hit kbd⌫ Backspace/kbd to delete them permanently. If you are accustomed to also press the kbd⌘ Command/kbd, like deleting a file in Finder, you can do so. But basically, backspace is enough.  <answer141805> All you have to do is any of the following:  ul lihold down the kbdOption/kbd key, while clicking on the trash can on the top toolbar/li lihold down the kbdOption/kbd key, while clicking on 'delete' on the top menubar/li lihold down the kbdOption/kbd key, while right-clicking on the desired emails and scroll down to select 'delete'/li lihold down the kbdOption/kbd key, while pressing the kbdDelete/kbd key on your keyboard./li /ul  <comment64551> I think the questioner wants to avoid the trash completely. <comment64552> I have the same issue. Due to a server error I have 25000 emails in a folder. I want to delete them instantly not move them all to the Trash folder. <comment113788> Given your reason for not emptying Trash I would create a new folder and move the questionable messages from trash to it to allow you to review them <comment167105> Welcome to Ask Different!
