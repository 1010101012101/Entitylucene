Can I adjust iPad display size to make it fit the screen better? <body> I have an iPad mini (original model) running iOS 8.4 Recently I have noticed many apps seem to be too large for the screen; usually the top or bottom is partly off screen.  When I press the button, the home screen displays normally for a few seconds, then seems to "grow" e.g. the iPad in the top left now shows "Pad" wth the "i" off the screen.  This may have been since a software upgrade, but I can't be sure.  <answer201446> Check Settings-General-Accessibility-Zoom and made sure that Zoom is unchecked. Other than that, as far as I know, there is no way to change anything like that, at least without Jailbreaking (and I strongly recommend against that). It does seem like the kind of thing that iOS 9 might fix, though.  <answer201697> Perhaps you have somehow turned on the Zoom feature of Accessibility?   ul liOpen the settings app/li litap general/li litap accessibility/li liturn off zoom/li /ul  If you need more details, the following article might help  https://www.apple.com/ios/accessibility-tips/  <comment243162> Zoom and accessibility could easily have this effect  no jailbreak needed. <comment243163> @bmike True, I completely forgot about that.
