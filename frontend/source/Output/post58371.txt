No Sites Folder in Mountain Lion after Upgrade <body>    After i upgraded Mountain Lion on my MacBook Air, i haven't any Sites   folder in my home-folder.   On my Mac Mini there is still my Sites folder with all my local sites in it.   strongHow do i get it back?/strong   ul liXAMPP is installed/li liXCode is installed/li liDeveloper tools are installed/li /ul  <answer58387> Have you tried just recreating the folder and naming it the same thing? I don't believe the folder is created when you install developer tools. It should be there due to Safari.  <comment67138> Simple Trick - solved my problem! Thank you! But i'm a german user, so sites is normally translated in "websites". So something is wrong... but it works! <comment67139> No problem, I'm glad that worked :)
