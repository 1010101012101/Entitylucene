FocusFollowsMouse, cut-paste from browser to Terminal in 10.8 (duplicate) <body> Added: this was discussed in focus-follows-mouse-plus-auto-raise-on-mac-os-x on SO in 2010. In short, accept it, or buy an addon: how-can-i-make-focus-follow-the-mouse-cursor.  hr The sequence:  ol licut text in a browser window (mouse swipe, ⌘ C: "Edit" blinks)  /li limove the mouse to a Terminal window (cursor goes solid)  /li liclick in the Terminal window -- strongnecessary in 10.8.3, not in 10.4 ?/strong  /li lipaste, ⌘ V  /li /ol  works only with "click in Terminal" on my new iMac 10.8.3.br On a 10.4 iMac though, ⌘ C - move mouse - ⌘ V works without the extra click.    Has FocusFollowsMouse changed in 10.8, or is it just me ?  I have  precodedefaults write com.apple.Terminal FocusFollowsMouse -string YES  defaults read | grep -i mouse --&gt;      "com.apple.mouse.scaling" = 1;                     default = "Time Profile App Under Mouse";                 NSMessage = timeProfileUnderMouse;     FocusFollowsMouse = YES; "com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.mouse" =     {     MouseButtonDivision = 55;     MouseButtonMode = OneButton;     MouseHorizontalScroll = 1;     MouseMomentumScroll = 1;     MouseTwoFingerDoubleTapGesture = 3;     MouseTwoFingerHorizSwipeGesture = 2;     MouseVerticalScroll = 1;     USBMouseStopsTrackpad = 0; "com.apple.driver.AppleHIDMouse" =     { /code/pre  If it matters, the mouse is a cable mouse, TERM = vt100.  <comment105877> FWIW, Terminal behaves the same way for me in 10.8, and iTerm 2 also requires clicking the window first. <comment109741> I don't recall `FocusFollowsMouse` sending Command keys to the terminal in previous versions. Command keys are usually only sent to the frontmost application, even if a background window has keyboard focus for normal input. <comment109742> Note that your `defaults` command is incorrect: replace `-string` with `-bool` (although some applications will figure out that the string "YES" should be treated like boolean YES, you must not rely on it).
