Can I remove admin rights from an OS X account without using the command line? <body> I gave my everyday OS X user account admin rights whilst trying to get a code project working.  I now no longer need admin rights. However, when I log in using either my everyday account emor/em my admin account, the “Allow user to administer this computer” checkbox for my everyday account is both selected and disabled, so that I can’t remove the admin rights from my account. (I did click on the padlock icon and unlock it using my everyday account password first.)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/usiwK.png" alt="enter image description here"  Is there a way to enable the checkbox, or another way to remove admin rights for this account?  I’ve seen how to do so on the command line, but it feels like there should be some way to do this in the GUI.  <answer226693> Aha — the reason why this option was greyed out is, I think, because I was still logged in under the everyday account.  When I emlogged out/em of the everyday account, and logged into my admin account (instead of just switching straight to the admin account, leaving my everyday account logged in), emthen/em the “Allow user to administer this computer” checkbox for my everyday account was enabled, and I could uncheck it.  <comment275285> Have you verified that the pane is unlocked by clicking on the Padlock in the lower left-hand corner to allow for editing? This is required to edit the page for admins as well. <comment275286> @smoooosher: I did!
