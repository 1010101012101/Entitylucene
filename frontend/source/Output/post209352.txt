Applescript: "can't get tab group 1 of window" (El Capitan) <body> The following is an applescript that I use to change audio output devices:  precodetell application "System Preferences"     activate     set current pane to pane "com.apple.preference.sound" end tell   tell application "System Events"     tell application process "System Preferences"         tell tab group 1 of window "Sound"             click radio button "Output"             if (selected of row 2 of table 1 of scroll area 1) then                 set selected of row 1 of table 1 of scroll area 1 to true                 set deviceselected to "Headphones"             else                 set selected of row 2 of table 1 of scroll area 1 to true                 set deviceselected to "MX279"             end if         end tell     end tell end tell tell application "System Preferences" to quit /code/pre  It worked on Yosemite, but when I updated to El Capitan it is giving me the following error:  precode"System Events got an error: Can't get tab group 1 of window \"Sound\" of application process \"System Preferences\". Invalid index" /code/pre  I'm pretty unfamiliar with applescript, so any ideas why this might be happening will be much appreciated.   <answer209434> In the first part of your script you load the codeSound/code preference pane. It can happen that the pane isn't fully loaded before you send commands to it in the second part of the script. The error says that the codetab group 1/code (the one that contains the codeOutput/code tab) doesn't exist at the moment you are trying to access it.   To make sure the codetab group 1/code exists, we can wait for it with these two lines:  precoderepeat until exists tab group 1 of window "Sound" end repeat /code/pre  The full script:  precodetell application "System Preferences"     activate     set current pane to pane "com.apple.preference.sound" end tell   tell application "System Events"     tell application process "System Preferences"         repeat until exists tab group 1 of window "Sound"         end repeat         tell tab group 1 of window "Sound"             click radio button "Output"             if (selected of row 2 of table 1 of scroll area 1) then                 set selected of row 1 of table 1 of scroll area 1 to true                 set deviceselected to "Headphones"             else                 set selected of row 2 of table 1 of scroll area 1 to true                 set deviceselected to "MX278"             end if         end tell     end tell end tell tell application "System Preferences" to quit /code/pre  <comment252783> That makes sense, thanks! Do you know why this was working for about 9 months prior and only now started acting up? System lag from El Capitan, maybe? <comment252810> Good question. To be honest, I don't know. <comment262482> Might you have any input for this question? http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/217148/using-apple-script-to-manage-sound-output-selection <comment265894> If you use "window 1" instead of "window 'sound' to refer to the window, it will also word on systems which run a non english system.
