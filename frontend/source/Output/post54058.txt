Mac OS X custom keyboard shortcuts <body> Whenever I set a custom keyboard shortcut in Mac OS X (10.6.8) for a menu item, I cannot use it until I open its menu by clicking on it at least once. This happens every time I launch an app and affects services too.  Is there a workaround?  <comment61862> Are you using the Keyboard preference pane to set these shortcuts? Are you sure they don't collide with another shortcut defines somewhere else? <comment61864> Yes, I do. And shortcuts don't collide with other shortcuts... <comment61865> That's odd; I've never seen that happen. Hopefully someone who has will have an answer. <comment61868> Try this test: make a new service using Automator, then assign it a shortcut... <comment61871> I set a keystroke for the service, then opened the Services menu it one app (to make sure it was assigned), ran it there via the keystroke, then went to a different app and ran it (successfully) via the keystroke there without opening the menu in that app. <comment61872> I have had this problem “forever” myself. It appears to be gone in one of the latest Lion updates. <comment61873> I'm pretty happy to know I won't have this bug anymore when I'll upgrade to ML. Thanks a lot! <comment61875> @egon1984 Harald didn't mention ML. <comment61876> Harald mentioned Lion, and ML is a Lion update. <comment61939> I think @HaraldHanche-Olsen meant 10.7.x. I'm still running into the same issue on 10.7.4 though. <comment61957> Yes, I meant 10.7.x. But if others are still seeing it on 10.7.4, then it may not have been the upgrade that cured it for me. <comment61958> So, which upgrade cured it for you?
