Mount ISO as CD/DVD in VMware fusion 5 <body> I am trying to mount as CD/DVD an ISO image of Windows 8, in VMWare Fusion 5, but i cant.  I dont know if this is a VMware bug.  I have rMBP, and since it doesn't have an optical drive, I have to mount ISO as a CD/DVD. But when the VM boots, i get a black screen with a "_" at top left corner.. and then nothing happens..  I tried to get into the BIOS and boot options while VM was booting.. with no luck. I read somewhere about drag and drop(the ISO), but still didn't manage to make it work.  Any help would be greatly appreciated!  <comment110619> nevermind. i tried the iso on a PC and i figured out that it was corrupted!
