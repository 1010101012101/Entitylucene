How to hide all file extensions in subdirectories of a given folder? <body> I know that I can open the file information dialogue (Get Info) for several files at once using ⌘⌥I and hide/unhide file extensions. How do I accomplish this for all files in a directory tree (including files in subfolders)?  <answer114057> Ok, I found a solution using Hazel:  I created a rule based on their posting emHow to get Hazel to go into subfolders/em:     If (…) emKind is Folder/em      Do the following (…) emrun rules on folder contents/em   The next rule selects a certain set of files, e.g.     If (…) emKind is pdf/em      Do (…) emRun AppleScript embedded script/em   The script is  precodetell application "Finder"     set extension hidden of theFile to true end tell /code/pre  I defined more conditions more different file types, so it doesn’t work on emall/em files as requested. With a limited number of different files this should be no problem.  <answer114058> You can easily do this in Terminal with the codeSetFile/code command:  strongTo hide file extensions in a directory and all sub-directories:/strong  precodecd &lt;path to directory&gt;  find . -name "*.*" -exec SetFile -a -E '{}' \; | echo "hiding extensions" /code/pre  (can change the second * to a particular extension type if you choose)  strongTo show file extensions in a directory and all sub-directories:/strong  precodecd &lt;path to directory&gt;  find . -name "*.*" -exec SetFile -a -e '{}' \; | echo "showing extensions" /code/pre  <comment172438> I think you meant to say "-a e", not "-a -e".  "e" designates the extension you're changing.  It's the argument to "-a". <comment172669> @Robert, It works the same with or without the `-`.
