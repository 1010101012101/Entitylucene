Windows 10 / Boot Camp on a Mid 2010 iMac with Sierra. "The installer disc could not be found." <body> I'm trying to install Windows 10 on my mid-2010 Sierra iMac (with optical drive) using Boot Camp.  I run Boot Camp and check the option to "Install Windows 10 or Later Version", and click Next, but then it says "The installer disc could not be found."  I can't progress beyond this message.  I have the Windows ISO file downloaded and mounted and ready to go (I mounted the ISO as a drive). But, from what I understand by researching this a bit, since my iMac has an optical drive, it seems like Boot Camp only ever looks for the Windows install disk in the optical drive.  Is this correct? Or is there another way to get Boot Camp to see the Windows installation disc other than using the optical drive? (mount it another way?)  Thanks.  <comment319454> I realize the question was about Windows 7, but the premise is the same. Also see http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/170759/bootcamp-no-iso-option <comment319461> Well, with System Integrity Protection on a Mac now it is harder than ever to edit those files, even as Root.  Maybe I'll just buy a DVD and try to burn one after all...  Man what a hassle.  This used to be so easy to run Boot Camp... <comment319510> @tubedogg How is this a dupe?  Win 10, macOS Sierra, and mounted ISO versus Win7, OS X, and USB key.  Apple/Oranges. <comment319514> @Allan No. The underlying issue is that the Mac is old enough to have an optical drive, which precludes Boot Camp from allowing a USB key to be created without modification of the Boot Camp app bundle. "mounted ISO" = "USB key" because the ISO has to be written somewhere that will be accessible after reboot and during the Windows installation process. The differing versions of Windows and macOS are irrelevant. The defining factor is the age of the hardware and what macOS allows as a result. <comment319515> @Allan The actual question is whether or not a mid-2010 iMac even supports booting from a USB key. That I don't know the answer to. But the above noted questions answer the "why" of the OP's query about the ISO option not being available.
