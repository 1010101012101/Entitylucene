what is the purpose of mds folder on a Mac <body> I found out that contents of codemds/code folder located at code/private/var/folders/zg/jjtx0_k94pdc5p5q6gcvf4900000gn/C/mds/code gets deleted and back created quite often. I wonder, that is the purpose of this folder and it's content? It contains codemdsDirectory.db/code, codemdsObject.db/code and codemds.lock/code files.  <comment292895> mds is a daemon for Spotlight. It indexes files to be searched by Spotlight. <comment292902> Thank you! So every time this folder gets modified a new file was created on filesystem? <comment293092> not necessarily, a file can be changed too. Why are you even worrying about these files? Be careful deleting files in `/private/var`.
