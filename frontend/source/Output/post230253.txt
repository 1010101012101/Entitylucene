Selecting text while jumping with cursor in iTerm2 <body> I would like to know if it is possible to get text-editor-like functionality for selecting text in iTerm2.  For example, in Sublime Text 3, I can do the following:  kbd&#8679; &#8997; &#8594;/kbd = Select word to the right of the cursor.  kbd&#8679; &#8984; &#8594;/kbd = Select entire line to the right of the cursor.  But I cannot for the life of me seem to do this in iTerm2.  I can add actions that make my cursor jump over words, or jump to the end of the line, strongbut not jump emand/em select at the same time./strong  To be clear: I am not looking for an emalternative/em to highlighting text in this manner (for example any method that begins with a kbd&#8984; F/kbd search or that requires a mouse), I am looking for the exact functionality outlined above.  <answer265771> You can setup key shortcuts for this functionality in iTerm2.     In Prefs  Profiles  Keys you can assign keys to move the beginning or end of the selection by a single character, word, or line. No such keys are bound by default.   To make a shortcut for the precise text selection you are referring to you would assign the shortcuts to the following actions,  code⇧ ⌥ →/code = codeMove end of selection forward, Move by word/code  code⇧ ⌘ →/code = codeMove end of selection forward, Move by line/code  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bWHFG.png" alt="Move end of selection forward, move by word" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/X7eK7.png" alt="Move end of selection forward, move by word"  Source: https://www.iterm2.com/documentation-one-page.html  <comment335058> I will accept this answer as it is clearly as good as we're going to get. *BUT*, readers should be aware that the functionality detailed here may be different from what they might expect. <comment335059> a) “Move by line” is basically unusable to people expecting text-editor-like functionality *only* within the user-editable portion of the command line. <comment335060> b) Most Mac users may like this, but separating the moving of the selection into "start" and "end" parts means that at best you can only get native Mac-style selection-moving when mixing back and forward selection-moves, rather than the (more Windows and Linux-centric?) convention used by Sublime Text.  (This is hard to explain — try it out to see what I mean.)
