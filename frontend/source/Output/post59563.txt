How to copy many emails to a specific folder rather than copy/paste the contents of each message? <body> I'm trying to create a project folder for some woodworking I will be doing over the next few weeks. Among the first items into this folder is a collection of ~25 emails containing photos and measurements of components on a similar project.    Is there a quick way to copy each of these emails to a specific folder rather than copy/paste'ing the contents of each one?  <answer59565> If the photos and measurements are attachments you could use Automator to download the selected messages to a folder.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/t0jye.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  strongEdit:/strong I wrote this AppleScript that will download the message and the attachments for all the selected emails in Mail. Make a new folder in your home directory called codeEmails/code and run the following code in AppleScript Editor.  strongNOTE:/strong Make sure the codeEmails/code folder is empty. There may be problems if there are items in it already.  precodetell application "Mail"     set the_messages to selection     repeat with this_message in the_messages         set message_subject to subject of this_message         set message_body to content of this_message         set download_path to "~/Emails/\"" &amp; message_subject &amp; "\""         set save_path to (POSIX path of ("/Users/" &amp; (short user name of (system info)) &amp; "/Emails/" &amp; message_subject &amp; "/"))          (* create a directory for the message and attachements *)         do shell script "mkdir -p " &amp; download_path          (* save message body into a file *)         do shell script "echo \"" &amp; message_body &amp; "\" &gt; " &amp; download_path &amp; "/message.txt"          (* save the attachments *)         repeat with the_attachment in this_message's mail attachments             save the_attachment in save_path &amp; ":" &amp; (name of the_attachment)         end repeat     end repeat end tell /code/pre  <answer59637> ol liSelect all the emails you want copied by clicking on each one with the command key pressed./li liDrag one of the selected emails to the Finder icon in the Dock. A Finder window should open. /li liNavigate to the folder where you want the emails copied by hovering your cursor over them.

I updated my answer to include AppleScript that should do what you want. <comment68720> Unfortunately, it does not work with multiple emails in Mountain Lion.  The emails simply snap back. <comment68724> I just tested, and on my iMac they do, but on my new MBP, they donâ€™t. Strange. <comment68726> I tested on my Mac Pro (Lion) and Macbook Pro (Mountain Lion).  It looks like it SHOULD work, but it doesn't.
