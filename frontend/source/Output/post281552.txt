Setting Apple Sierra finder to show the full directory tree by default? <body> I have this issue since upgrading to Sierra that the finder doesn't show the full location when it opens for things like downloading, saving, etc. This is across multiple apps including Chrome, Safari, Adobe products, etc. See attached screenshots but the problems works as follows:  ol liInitially I am prompted with the last memorized location I downloaded, saved, etc.  /li liThen if I'm wanting to save/download to a different directory I have to click the dropdown to select a new location.  /li liAfter that, the finder window shows the full location.  /li /ol  How do I set this default so I can see the full location each time instead of having to click several times to see everything? I get that memorizing the last location is helpful but not fully if I don't have the option to go see the whole tree.
