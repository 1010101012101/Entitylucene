Weird display issue on OS X Lion when switching external monitor <body> I'm using a MBP with a second (external) monitor and since I upgraded from Snow Leopard to Lion, I encountered some display issues that appear in the emApplication Switcher/em, and sometimes in the menu-bar.  In case of the menu, the font in the dropdown appears with jagged edges, as if there suddenly was a huge contrast-change affecting only the menu-items.  In case of the emApplication Switcher/em, the effect is even worse as shown in this image:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6XcB1.jpg" alt="display issue on mac os x lion"  Interestingly, this glitch seems to strongonly/strong affect overlays like the emApplication Switch/em or the menu. The rest of my OS and all Applications are looking fine.  If I go to emSystem Preferences/em and choose another color-profile for my monitor, the issue is gone. If I select the previously selected color-profile, the issue appears again. The issue happens with every profile though. So if I choose emAdobe RGB (1998)/em and restart my computer, the issue occurs. It disappears when I select another profile, for example emApple RGB/em. After a restart, the glitch will re-appear (even with the newly selected emApple RGB/em) and only a profile-change will remove it.  It's not too big of a deal, but if anybody has some pointers how to resolve this, I'd really appreciate it. Btw. the issue appears on different monitors, so it's not some monitor-hardware fault or anything.  strongUpdate:/strong I was under the impression that the issue reappears after a restart. That assumption was wrong, the issue appears whenever I switch the external monitor (eg. change from monitor at work to the one at home).  <answer35091> I am also experiencing the same problems and have posted a thread to the Macbook Pro Apple Forums. While there isn't any answer yet you might be interested in following along that thread.  So far the only reliable way to fix it would be to restart the machine. Or to log out and log back in. Neither method is satisfactory.  <answer38529> Here's a sequence I have had some luck with without having to log off and on.  ol liMBP in standby mode./li liEnsure monitor is turned off./li liHook up external monitor cable./li liOpen MBP and wait for recognition of second monitor./li liPower on the second monitor and sign in./li /ol  This works with both my Dell and Lenovo monitors.  Both of them are my primary displays.  <answer41472> I have been able to work around the issue using the free app stronggfxCardStatus/strong to switch between integrated and discrete graphics on my MBP.  It doesn't matter which you use, switching to the other one fixes the problem until next time.  <answer48273> I've had an identical problem on my 2010 MBP since upgrading to Lion last fall. Here's what I did today that seemed to fix the problem:  1) Go into Macintosh HD and find code/Library/colorsync/profiles/displays/codebr 2) Move all files in the 'displays' directory into a backup folder on your Desktopbr 3) Open System Preferences  Displays and click on "Color" for each of your displaysbr 4) Your computer will take a few seconds and create a fresh display file for each monitor.     After doing this all the weird screen artifacts and colors have gone away on both my MPB LCD display and my 19" external monitor connected with mini-DVI.  <comment39999> That seems to be the same issue as here. I didn't notice that it's caused by screen-switching! That might be the root of the problem, as I was doing that as well. Will watch that thread.. please make sure to post the solution here if one comes up! <comment55311> I had the same problem but it seems to be working fine now after upgrading to 10.7.3. <comment55319> Interesting. I'm currently checking this.. will see if it works when I'm back at home. Although going to `Displays  Color` didn't create new color profiles. It was disconnecting/connecting the external Monitor that did this (you might want to add/fix that in your anser). <comment55431> This seems to have solved the issue. Thanks. <comment65373> Thanks for this, I'd set it to integrated only to preserve battery. When I connected to a monitor later, it wasn't recognized. I had to change it back to dynamic.
