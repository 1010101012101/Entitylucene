How to fix this OS X Dock Tooltip encoding problem? <body> I'm running Lion in French and have had the following bug in my Dock for the last couple of weeks. It doesn't go away if I reboot or kill the Dock.  Have you ever seen something like that before?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rDmUP.png" alt="My Dock&#39;s going crazy!"  <answer44658> You could find the strings file (which holds the translations) and do a search and replace on nonstandard characters.  <comment50782> That sounds hackish :) <comment50783> It's only a little hackish. You're better of doing that than messing with finder. <comment50803> What have you done to get this problem? <comment50806> To the best of my knowledge, nothing at all. <comment50807> Oh, those problems are the best of all :)
