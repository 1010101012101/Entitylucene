Docksend in Transmit 4 by Panic no longer works after upgrading to OS 10.7.3 <body> I've just upgraded to OS 10.7.3 and Docksend in Transmit 4 by Panic no longer works. I drop files on the dock icon and nothing happens in Transmit.  <answer45416> I used the strongUsing DockSend/strong help menu and it worked like a charm for me. I'm on 10.7.3 as well:  You might just need to toggle it off, wait (perhaps reboot) and toggle it back on. Here are detailed instructions from the help menu:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IoKzG.png" alt="enter image description here"  So, following that, you'll end up here:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iRPWC.png" alt="enter image description here"  Make sure that strongUse DockSend/strong checkbox is checked! If it is and it still won't work, I would reinstall Transmit. If it still won't work after that, definitely contact Panic support.  <comment86571> I'm reopening this since even though few people might still run 10.7.3 - there is useful information even if this sits in a dark corner of the site. Unless the information is actively wrong, let's leave this on the site since it's not clear this really is tied to 10.7.3...
