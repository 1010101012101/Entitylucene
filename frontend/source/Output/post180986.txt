Bulk merge items sub-folders into new folder <body> I have a main folder with about 80 folders in, each with about 10 items in. I want to be able to use a Terminal command or something to just move every item from each sub-folder into a new one (i.e the newly created folder would have around 800 items in, not separated by individual folders). Doing this by hand would be very tedious. Is there a way to do it easily and quickly? I have looked at codeditto/code, but couldn't figure out how to use it for my use case. Any help would be much appreciated, thank you!  <answer180988> Assuming the structure is like  precodemain-folder     subfolder-1         item-1         item-2     subfolder-2         item-3         item-4 /code/pre  and all the items are uniquely named, you can use  precodecd main-folder mkdir ../target-folder mv */* ../target-folder/ /code/pre  to move everything into a target folder on the same directory level as the main folder. If you just want to move everything into the main folder, just use  precodecd main-folder mv */* . /code/pre  <comment215129> `mv */* .` worked perfectly, thank you! So easy :)
