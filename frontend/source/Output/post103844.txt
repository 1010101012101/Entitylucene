Wallpaper Identification: Where can I find a better version of this? <body> (Please forgive me + nuke from orbit of these kinds of questions aren't allowed here. Don't know where else to ask.)  I'm trying to find a higher-res version of this specific wallpaper: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8dwNa.jpg" alt="iPhone Wallpaper"  The site where I got the iPhone version did not deal with iPad wallpapers, so I didn't have an option there. Nor did it list an author for me to track down. I've tried Google image search for similar images and just plain browsing a ton of other sites, but I can't find anything.  Thanks!  <answer103850> That's actually Tiger's (Mac OSX 10.4) default wallpaper.   I found one easily on Google searching codeTiger default wallpaper/code : http://www.journaldulapin.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Aqua-Blue-10.4.jpg  It might just need a little rotation :)   <comment122253> wow, what a keen eye :) <comment122369> This is why I asked here. Awesome, thanks! :)
