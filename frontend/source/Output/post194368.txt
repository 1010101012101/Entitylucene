Turn Wifi off/on with a single key? <body> Is there a way to assign the WiFi on/off function to one of the function keys like F4 that I otherwise never use? I assume Applescript would be required. However I may want to use a BASH script instead.  <answer194372> Thanks to budakpisang for this:  In terminal, you can turn wifi off and on with these commands  precodenetworksetup -setairportpower en1 off networksetup -setairportpower en1 on /code/pre  en1 being wifi. Try codenetworksetup -listnetworkserviceorder/code to see whether that's right for you or not.  Here's a one-liner to toggle between on and off  precodenetworksetup -getairportpower en1 | grep "On" &amp;&amp; networksetup -setairportpower en1 off || networksetup -setairportpower en1 on /code/pre  strongCreate a keyboard shortcut that runs a shell command/strong  ol liStart Automator, and create a new Service./li liSet "Service receives selected: to "no input" in "any application"./li liAdd an action named "Run Shell Script".

The following script doesn't make any assumptions on which network adapter is used for WiFi:  precodeset_wifi_on_or_off() {   networksetup -getairportpower en${n} | grep ": ${1}";   if test $? -eq 0;   then     echo WiFi interface found: en${n};     eval "networksetup -setairportpower en${n} ${2}"     return 0;   fi   return 1; }  for n in $(seq 0 10); do   if set_wifi_on_or_off "On" "off"; then break; fi;   if set_wifi_on_or_off "Off" "on"; then break; fi; done /code/pre  <comment231828> Thanks. That's a little more involved that I'd like. I reinstall my OS periodically to wipe away any malware infections. Doing all those steps each time would be tedious. I'll file a feature request with Apple for a switch or something. <comment232183> Note that on some machines (e.g. late model Macbook Pro Retina), the WiFi network is eth0. <comment309769> F12 is increase volume see Apple's list of keyboards https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201794 <comment309770> F12 on windows US standard Keyboard :) <comment309771> This is an Apple based site so Apple keyboards are expected here so we want an answer for that <comment343124> @Ebu You can copy over this folder to keep your services: `~/Library/Services`
