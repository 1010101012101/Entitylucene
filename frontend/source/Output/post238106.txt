Restore iphone 5 with broken wake/sleep button <body> I have forgotten my 4-digit iphone passcode and want to restore it but have a broken wake/sleep button and cannot find a way to do so online, any suggestions?  <answer238114> Follow Apple Support's guide for what to do if you forgot the passcode on your phone: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204306   You shouldn't need the sleep/wake button for this. Once you get your iPhone unlocked with the help of that article, turn on "AssistiveTouch" in Settings-General-Accessability so you can sleep your phone again.  <comment291861> Did you forget your AppleID password? Or the 4-digit code to get into the actual device? <comment291862> 4-digit code to the device <comment291872> The Recovery Mode mentioned in that article for the link you provided requires the use of the power button. I don't believe this will work. <comment292234> @TMHahn I don't believe that it requires the use of the power button. If you have a mac, you can just plug your iPhone into iTunes and hit "restore iPhone".
