Applications folder not owned by root, cannot change it <body> After a recent run of Migration Assistant from an old MacBook to a new one, my Applications folder is owned by my normal user account rather than by root.  This prevents VirtualBox from functioning (see here, for example).  Attempting to fix the permissions with a simple codesudo chown root /Applications/code gives the error codechown: /Applications: Operation not permitted/code.  This is pleasantly vague, and the Internet assures me that there may be many causes.  (I had other sources I could cite, but I'm new to this site, and thus can only post up to 2 links.)  I do not wish to just start removing flags carelessly from code/Applications/code, so I've done some investigating instead.  Here's what's NOT the problem:  ul liFile flags:  Only the codesunlnk/code flag is set, which prevents code/Applications/code from being deleted.  Seems entirely appropriate for code/Applications/code, so I think there's no problem there.  In particular, the codesuchg/code flag is NOT set./li liSIP:  That feature doesn't govern the code/Applications/code folder, as far as my reading indicates.  So I don't think I need to do any of the "Recovery Mode" business to disable SIP./li liACLs:  The only one reported by codels -le/code is codegroup:everyone deny delete/code which, again, seems entirely appropriate, and doesn't seem to have anything to do with codechown/code./li /ul  So that's what's NOT the problem (I think).  But I don't know what IS the problem.  <answer245756> Funnily enough this is a perfect example of one of the few situations where repairing disk permissions is actually called for.  Unfortunately the Repair Disk Permissions option has been removed from Disk Utility in El Capitan.  However you can still do it from the command line.  In Terminal run the following command to find out which permissions are incorrect.     sudo /usr/libexec/repair_packages --verify --standard-pkgs /   And run the following command to repair the permissions.     sudo /usr/libexec/repair_packages --repair --standard-pkgs --volume /   More information here: http://osxdaily.com/2015/11/04/verify-repair-permissions-mac-os-x/  <answer245765> What shows your 'Get Info' command (right-click on Applications folder) and can you change owner from there?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ORMa5.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer245822> Turns out I was wrong to assume that SIP could not be at fault.  When trying the operation with SIP disabled, it worked.  I also needed to codechmod/code /Applications to have permissions 755 (was 775) before VirtualBox would be happy, but that, too, was doable with SIP disabled.  All working now.  Thanks to a discussion ranklord and I had in some comments above, and then in the chat for this question, for figuring this out.  <comment303035> Is `sunlnk` a valid flag? I don't have el capitan but you can check in `man 2 chflags`. <comment303036> I can confirm `sunlnk` on the /Applications folder on El Capitan. <comment303038> Thank you, but this did not succeed.  While this did repair a lot of things, it also gave a lot of "Error 1: Operation not permitted" messages.  At the end, my Applications folder is still owned by my main user, not root. <comment303041> My UI does not look like yours.  I do not have a "Permissions" section, just a "Sharing & Permissions" section with a different UI, like this: https://ibin.co/2npqPDIByBvN.png <comment303043> Yes, `sunlnk` means you that the "unlnk" (unlink = delete) operation is "s"et (the flag is on, not off). <comment303044> Is the user under which you are working in admin group then? <comment303046> No, I seem to be in the "staff" group. <comment303047> Then you need to check permissions for this group. Could be that you don't have enough rights to change ownership of the folder. Or add yourself to admins group <comment303048> The group for the `/Applications` folder is currently `staff`.  That's the folder that matters, right (not its containing folder)? <comment303049> Hmm... May be we have close encounter with [SIP](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Security/Conceptual/System_Integrity_Protection_Guide/ConfiguringSystemIntegrityProtection/ConfiguringSystemIntegrityProtection.html) here? :) <comment303050> Let us [continue this discussion in chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/42396/discussion-between-nathan-and-ranklord). <comment303063> Beside the topic of this post: what did you do/install to make the "Get Info" panel look like this?
