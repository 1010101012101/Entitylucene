How do I connect my Mid-2010 iMac to my Late 2015 Macbook Pro <body> I mistook the mini Display Port (mDP) behind my iMac to mean it was a Thunderbolt port. The kbdâŒ˜ Command/kbd kbdF2/kbd does not work when both ends are Thunderbolt for my setup.  Please suggest what cables to buy.   Edit: This is 27 inch iMac  Model Identifier: iMac11,3  <answer243544> If you are using a 27 inch iMac (Mid 2010) then you need a mDP to mDP cable.  According to Apple's Support Page, Use your iMac as a display with Target Display Mode, you can accomplish this with the cable referenced above, but only with a 27" iMac if you are using the Mid 2010 model.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ynq0G.png" alt="system requirements"  <comment299940> Which iMac do you have specifically?  Please issue the command `system_profiler SPHardwareDataType | grep -i identifier` in Terminal and post the results to your original question. <comment299944> Do I need an mDP to ThunderBolt cable too - my MBP does not have a mDP port. It has two Thunderbolt ports instead. <comment299947> No.  mDP to mDP per Apple.  A Thunderbolt port is a combination of mDP **and** PCIe. <comment299951> So one end of the new mDP cable will connect to the iMac and the other end will also fit into the Thunderbolt port on my MBP? <comment299952> Added  Model Identifier: iMac11,3 <comment299954> Correct.  mDP and TB use the same connector.  I wrote a primer on TB [here](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/228892/119271). <comment299956> Thanks.  That info is super important to make sure we are giving you an accurate answer.
