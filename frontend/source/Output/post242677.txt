In Accessibility, what does "Descriptions" do? <body> In strongEl Capitan/strong's Accessibility Preference pane, there is a setting for strongVideo/strong strongDescriptions/strong:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4sBqD.png" alt="enter image description here"  After looking here and there, I couldn't find very many informations about this feature. I understand that it might be a feature developed specially for people that are visually impaired, but as a person who produces films and videos, I would love to know more about this.  What films is this feature working on? (just strongiTunes/strong films?, Does it work with standalone files? strongYouTube/strong videos?)  How is this implemented technically (one of the links I gave mentions strongFinal Cut Pro/strong, but what is the standard called? Can I make videos on strongPremiere/strong that will be compatible with it, no matter how audio tracks are embedded?)  I am interested in learning more about ways to make videos I produce available for more people, and this setting didn't seem very obvious for me in helping me understand how to do so.  <comment316114> did you learn something out of here? I'm blind and I'm also curious!
