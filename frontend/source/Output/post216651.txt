Adding photos to iPhone from Mac using image capture <body> Does anyone know of a way that I can put photos on my iPhone using image capture?  <answer216652> Add the pictures to your photostream in Photos.They will appear on your phone if you have Photo streaming turned on.  <comment261851> Actually, it needs to be using image capture because it bypasses Live Photos and separates it into a photo and a video. I'm trying to play with the framework by making fake Live Photos <comment261852> Fascinating question - the data flow is clearly designed to go the other way, but sometimes you can find hidden settings or tricks. <comment261855> Hmm I use image Capture to connect to a scanner. It captures in picture formats not video. Isn't that what you want? <comment261856> Image capture works for all video formats as well <comment261860> Interesting but your question was how to put photos on your phone not video. I just dragged a photo to Photos and it appears on my phone. Try that with your video. <comment261861> But Photos carries the 6s Live Photo metadata. I need to bypass that which is why I'm using image capture
