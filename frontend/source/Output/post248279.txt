iCloud Music Library and Apple Music subscriber - mass delete all local music files from iPhone <body> I enabled iCloud Music Library and subscribed to Apple Music.  I have iPhone with 16 GB and wish to delete all local music files, to free up space for other stuff. Before iCloud Music I would "not sync" my music files and then they get deleted from iPhone.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZLaVr.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HmLMS.png" alt="enter image description here"  With a search engine I found how to to delete songs in Music app. Bud sadly I need to delete every artist individually.
