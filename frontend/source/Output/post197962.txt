How do I record my iPhone's screen and sound whilst recording my mic <body> I have my iPhone plugged into my computer via USB, I have QuickTime Player open and am previewing my iPhone screen as well as the iPhone's audio, but how would I go about recording my audio from my microphone which is connected to my computer, all in QuickTime? I have tried Audacity, but that didn't work due to lag with QuickTime and that caused the audio to be horrendously out of sync.  <answer198236> Try having two Quicktime recording windows open (one Movie recording--iPhone screen and audio, and one Audio recording for your microphone). Just start the two recording sessions together (they don't have to started at the exact same time, you can edit them later) and then use iMovie or Final Cut Pro to edit the clips so your iPhone audio and visual plays simultaneously with your other audio recording.  <comment237259> Okay - thanks for your answer!
