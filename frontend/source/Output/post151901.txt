1x icons appearing on retina MacBook Pro <body> I updated my retina MacBook Pro to OS X Yosemite and noticed that a number of the icons in preference windows are appearing at 1x, which looks terrible. The weird thing is that it seems to be the emsame/em couple of icons that appear at 1x, even though they're used in different apps.  For example, the General icon (the lightswitch) appears at 1x in Safari, Terminal, Calendar, Messages, Contacts, etc.; the only app that shows it correctly at 2x is Finder. Same for the Advanced icon (the gear).  Here's Calendar preferences – you can see how all the icons other than Accounts are blurry:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/z9Fny.png" alt="enter image description here"  Now compare to Finder and notice how much sharper the General and Advanced icons are:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KuNq1.png" alt="enter image description here"  I've tried rebooting and also adjusting my resolution up/down to see if it would "refresh" the icons, but neither has helped. Is there anything else I can try? Or did Apple actually forget to include 2x icons in these apps? ;-)  <comment178737> In looking through the Calendar resources folder, I'm not seeing the Advanced and General icons at all, so I suspect they reference system copies instead (no reason to have duplicate copies in the app bundle). There are definitely 2x versions of those icons, since they appear correctly in Finder. It would appear to be a bug causing the wrong image to be displayed for those icons.
