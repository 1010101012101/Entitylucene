How can I get the Chinese Plants vs. Zombies 2 on iOS without jailbreak <body> I have been trying to get the Chinese version of Plants vs. Zombies 2. I use an iPhone 5c iOS 9.2. I will do just about anything but I do not want to jailbreak or lose any in app purchases I made with my American account.  <answer228399> You can create a Chinese Apple ID to download free content without a Chinese payment method, however you stated that…     I do not want to … lose any in app purchases I made with my American account.   You can't do this regardless of whether you create a Chinese Apple ID.  <comment278523> I am having trouble creating an account since I don't have an credit card to fill it out and I'm not getting the none option. Thank you for answering
