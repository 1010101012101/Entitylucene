What's an effective way to proactively spot runaway processes? <body> Sometimes my Mac ends up with a runaway process; a process that's hogging all the CPU. Often it's Firefox, but I've had a few others recently. Normally I don't spot this for a while until I notice my fan is running like crazy. This can kill battery life. Is there any way to effectively be proactively be notified about these processes?  hr  Bonus points if the solution doesn't involve paid-for software. Extra bonus points if I can use an inbuilt facility of OS X.  emNote/em: I'm not looking for how to locate and kill runaway processes; I already know how to to do that with codetop/code once I suspect there may be one. I would like to be pro-actively notified that a process has been chewing more than X% cpu for Ys time.  <comment111790> On my mac mini the fans audibly start up when a process starts using much CPU <comment111803> A similar earlier question: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/90270 <comment111808> Agreed, that's a dup. Thanks for spotting.
