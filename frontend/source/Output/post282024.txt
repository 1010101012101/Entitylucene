Remove Sound Output Device <body> How do I remove an output device on a MacBook air? My computer has two outputs: Internal (which I want) and Belkin S52, which I want to remove. I have tried looking this up, but most of them are for sound flower or boom. I have tried looking through extensions and audio plug-ins, but I can't find it. It, for some reason always changes my sound from internal to Belkin S52, meaning I can never hear anything unless I manually change the volume setting, and some times it just goes back to Belkin for seemingly no reason. Is there a solution?  <answer282027> I'm not familiar with the Belkin S52, but assuming it's a sound device the first thing I would try is using the Audio MIDI Setup app to remove it.  Follow these steps:  ul liLaunch the Audio MIDI Setup (by default, this app is located in Applications  Utilities  Audio MIDI Setup)/li liOnce open you'll see a list of devices on the left-hand side/li liSelect the Belkin S52/li liNow click on the minus kbd-/kbd button to remove it/li liFollow any prompts you may get/li /ul  If the minus kbd-/kbd button isn't available, or the Belkin S52 isn't listed, you may need to clarify your question to include details on what the Belkin S52 is and how you installed it originally.
