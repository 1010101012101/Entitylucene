My mac won't recognize my headset <body> Since Apple change my motherboard last week, my early 2011 MBP 15" won't recognize the mic of my headset... I tried to reboot, search in the settings panel but I can't make it work...  I tried in both holes, in and out (it used to work with both) with no success...  What else can I try ?  <answer148229> New motherboard comes with new SMC controller.  I would suggest your run a Reset-SMC on yours to correctly identify hour hardware.  <comment174663> Resetting your SMC might help.
