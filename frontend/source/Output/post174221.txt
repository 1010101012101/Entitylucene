Using Boot Camp Support Software 4.0.4033 to install 64 bit Windows 7 or 8 <body> My computer is a iMac (20-inch, Mid 2007). The model identifier is iMac7,1. The processor name is Intel Core 2 Duo, which means I have a 64 bit machine. The Apple web site Boot Camp: System requirements for Microsoft Windows operating systems shows the only downloadable Boot Camp support software for my Mac is for the 32 bit version of Windows 7. I can successfully install the 64 bit DVD installation versions of Windows 7 and 8 on my machine. The problem I am having is with the Boot Camp Support Software 4.0.4033. When I follow the instructions and double click on setup.exe, I get the following popup.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8YhhP.png" alt="Installation Error"  How do I successfully install this support software and avoid this popup?  <answer174227> These are the instructions for a Windows 7 Professional Service Pack 1 (64 bit) installation.
