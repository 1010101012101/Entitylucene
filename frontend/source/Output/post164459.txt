Macbook 13 inch - Screen Noise on attached display <body> I have a 13 Inch Macbook (2014) running Yosemite -  the computer has been attached to an external dell monitor via the HDMI port. The screen works fine but on waking the computer from sleep, I see noise (see image below) on the external monitor. I have to plug out the monitor and plug it in again to make it work.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/69jqM.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer164503> It looks like timing issue between monitor and your Macbook.  You might try different cable or just turning monitor off and on with a button (much better than wearing off HDMI socket btw)
