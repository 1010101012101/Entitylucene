Download folder from iCloud Drive web <body> I want to download a folder from iCloud Drive using the web interface (iCloud.com). The only problem is, since it is not zipped, I cannot download the folder. Is there a way to download the folder without having to sync the entire content of my iCloud Drive with my computer?  <answer274651> Yes, you can do this.  The following assumes you're already logged-in to your iCloud account and you have the ability to download files to your local drive.  ol liNavigate to your iCloud Drive in any browser./li liChange your browser's default download location to wherever you want the files to be located.  You must do this now because you can't select a new location once you click the 'download' button later./li liGo into the folder that you want to downlonad.  You can't just hightlight the folder and try to download the folder and its contents from here.  You actually have to go into the folder first./li liSelect all the files you want to download.  Do this either by selecting each one or by doing a select-all keyboard command./li liOnce all the files are selected, go to the top of the iCloud screen and click the 'download' icon (cloud with arrow going down).  This will download all the selected files to your default download location (set it step 2).  The files should not be downloaded in a zip format, they should come down exactly as they're stored in iCloud./li /ol  All the files will download which, in essence, is what you wanted by selecting the folder and trying to download that first.  <comment345339> This is essentially a dupe of http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/274501/how-to-view-icloud-files-without-downloading <comment345342> @Tetsujin not directly. The older question is about enabling iCloud Drive on a Mac without downloading automatically, this one here is about downloading whole folders through Safari. At least in theory there might be solutions for one but not the other <comment345344> @Tetsujin I want to download folders from iCloud Drive web version. For example, If I am on a Windows machine at work, I would want to download the folder without installing software to download the entire content to my work computer. <comment345347> OK, possibly not a true dupe, but still two questions trying to achieve the same goal. I didn't VTC, so I'll leave it at that. <comment345364> What about folders in folders? <comment345367> It' an iterative process so you'll need to do each folder separately.  I could not find any other way of doing this from Windows.  If you were on a Mac, you could just use Finder to copy the folders.  If you have iCloud installed on Windows, you might already have it integrated into Windows Explorer and can download/copy from there. <comment370411> Pretty sure this is not the solution OP is looking for.
