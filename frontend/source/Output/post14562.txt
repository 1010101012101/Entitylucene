Do I need to be a member of iOS Developers program to develop and install an app on my iPad? <body> Do I need to be a member of iOS Developers program to develop and install an app on my iPad ?  Or can I just run Xcode and specify the device on which to install it ?  <answer14564> strongUPDATE:/strong With XCode 7 it is now possible to deploy an app on your own iOS9+ device for free. Only if you need to publish your app to the AppleStore will you need the paid membership. See qqbenq's answer for more details.  Without being a member, you can only run your app in the simulator. You must be a paid member to be able to install the app on a device.  Free:     Start developing for iOS and Mac OS X with the Xcode IDE, Dashcode, Instruments, Interface Builder, iOS Simulator and a suite of additional developer tools.   Paid:     Test and debug your code on iPad, iPhone and iPod touch to finalize your applications.   <answer30060> You can do it if the iPad is Jailbroken. But that means you have to Jailbreak your device and the app may not work on non jailbroken devices, as you cannot test in the live enviroment.  If you join the dev programme you will get the beta downloads of iOS as well as being able to submit to the app store.  My advice would be, if you want to hang onto your cash for a while longer, develop the app, test it in the simulator that comes from downloading xCode, and once you are happy with it join the program.  <answer116655> You need a jailbroken device. In my side, i recommend to jailbreak it. Besides this, it has a lot of cool and useful things to add.

Simply sign in with your Apple ID,   and turn your idea into an app that you can touch on your iPad,   iPhone, or Apple Watch. Download Xcode 7 beta and try it yourself   today. Program membership is not required.   Quoted from: https://developer.apple.com/xcode/  If you need to have other Apple ID run your app, then TestFlight and the paid Apple developer account makes sense. You also need to pay if you can not/will not use iOS 9 and Xcode 7 and want to run older tools and OS.  <comment34486> You just need _some_ developer to sign your build so it runs on your device so you could always see if you could join an existing team of developers or a school that has an educational development program. These are not ideal if you truly need to rapidly develop your own app, but this can work if a friend has unused device slots and is willing to share with you. <comment136442> Welcome to Ask Different!

Dont care about selling/ appstore etc. <comment259717> Yeah, that's true. You only need to have an apple ID and that's all. (I believe the certificate you sign your app with will require you to re-deploy the app periodically - like 3 months or so) <comment259721> So, the $100 paid program is for devs who want to deploy to appstore and no issues for people wanting personal apps
