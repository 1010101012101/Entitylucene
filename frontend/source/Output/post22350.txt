Used to be possible in Snow Leopard to move an app between `desktops` with a keyboard shortcut? <body> You could assign a keyboard shortcut to move the app with focus to a specific desktop.  Can't find this in Lion.  Anyone know if it's still possible?  <answer22397> I figured out how to do this.    ul liOpen System Prefs  keyboard/li liOn Keyboard Shortcuts tab choose Mission Control/li liEnable the "Switch to Desktop..." shortcuts /li liNow when you click on a window and perform the Switch to Desktop keyboard shortcut it'll move that window to the desktop/li /ul  Guess there is a mouse component to this, so it's not pure keyboard.  But I find it way easier than dragging windows around in mission control.  <comment24794> Did this shortcut really exist? I don't remember seeing it. <comment24799> Same here, I was never aware of such a thing existing. <comment24841> I figured it out! See answer below.  Actually never changed, still works the same way as Leopard.  Hadn't used it lately since Spaces never stuck with me.  Mission Control actually seems useful so am reinvestigating how some of it's stuff works.
