Exporting highlights from Kindle Personal Documents to a TXT file <body> There are two main categories in Kindle App for iPad:  ul liBooks - contains books purchased from Amazon; highlights are available at https://kindle.amazon.com/your_highlights â€” it works fine for me./li liPersonal Documents - contains all other books; highlights are not available online./li /ul  So, I have book purchased at different source than Amazon and I would like to be able to export my highlights and notes to a text file (or any other common format). My approaches so far:  ul liAs far as I know, https://kindle.amazon.com/your_highlights is available for Books category and thus, for Amazon-purchased books only. There are no entries from "Personal Documents"/li liI cannot move my book from Personal Document to Books - there is no such option in Kindle App. There is no such option on Amazon's "Manage Your Kindle" site too./li liThere is no option to export all highlights. Kindle app has option to share a highlight via Facebook or Twitter, but there is no option for copy or export it./li /ul  I synced my book with Kindle Touch and highlights are synced successfully. But:  ul liThere is no export option in Kindle Touch too./li liI am unable to read highlights content on my cpu. The file with highlights has extension code.azw3r/code and contains relative references, for example: codeannotation.personal.highlight 283390 283606/code./li liThere are no entries in codeMy Clippings/code text file (there are entries there but for non-synced books)./li /ul  The question is: strongHow can I export my highlights and notes from iPad Kindle App to a TXT or any other common file?/strong  emNote I'm using Windows but I put this question to Apple.SE since the root problem comes from iPad./em  <answer150348> You can use Bookcision or a more feature filled iOS app Snippefy.  Hope this helps.  <answer197159> This solution works previous to iOS 8.3, wish I knew what to do on 8.4 though! :  ol   li Download & install an app such as iFunBox Classic (free). This app allows you to explore your iPhone files with no jailbreak required.    li Plug your iPhone/iPad into PC via USB and start iFunBox Classic.   li In iFunBox, navigate to "User Applications/Kindle/Library".  li Copy the file "AnnotationStorage" to your computer. /ol  codeAnnotationStorage/code is an SQL database and can be read with a free app such as SQLiteBrowser.   <comment134458> Basically it's a Kindle problem but let's see whether anybody has an answer. <comment186805> Thank you for the answer. Bookcision doesn't work because the book doesn't appear on "Your books" collection. Snippefy is a paid solution; I'm looking for a free one. <comment201862> Have you ever found a solution for this?? <comment201939> @Giuliano: Unfortunately - not.
