All of my events have disappeared in the new Photos app for OSX Yosemite <body> I have just upgraded OSX Yosemite and have been looking at the new Photos app.  It seems all of my events have disappeared.  How do I get them back?  <answer180166> The best option for working with events is to use the sidebar (cmd + alt + s or view â†’ Show Sidebar). They will be listed there:  img src="https://imgur.com/oLUDeLn.png" alt="screenshot"  Without using the sidebar they are listed in the Albums section:  img src="https://imgur.com/U6SiZ8l.png" alt="screenshot"  <comment213988> Thankyou.  Can I ask a related question... Should I be using Events or Albums?  Say I go to the Zoo with my family, take some pictures and then import into Photos.  Is that an Event or an Album?  I always used Events with iPhoto. <comment214016> @rf_wilson Please ask this as a new question. No one can easily answer (or even see in many cases) a follow on question buried in the comments. <comment214017> Woah! There's a sidebar in photos and it's actually useful! +10 thanks <comment214059> @rf_wilson think that's more personal preference, but I'd say go with albums for Photos. They are more easily accessible in the sidebar for drag 'n drop for example.
