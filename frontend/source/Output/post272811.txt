Why won't Calendar find my appointments <body> I had previously used Calendar search, but lately (since Sierra?) it won't seem to find my appointments.  One example, I saw a Dr Wong some years ago, and was checking the date.  I searched for "Wong", and Calendar even suggested "Dr Wong", but showed codeNo Results/code. A manual search found the appointment in September 2014.  Is there anything I can change to make Search work?  Spotlight Search found my Contacts, and Calendar for "Dr Wong"
