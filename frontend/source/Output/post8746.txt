How do I exclude video podcasts from my podcast smart playlist <body> I created a Smart Playlist to sync to my iPod Touch so I can listen to my podcasts one after the other while I'm on a long drive. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ds38Q.png" alt="Smart Playlist"  I can't figure out how to leave Video Podcasts off that list, though.  Is there a way?  <answer8748> Adding codeKind contains 'audio'/codeshould do the trick. At least it's what I'm doing and it works.br codeKind contains 'video'/code will give you the video Podcasts.  <comment9294> Actually, "Kind contains 'video'" misses some that have a Kind of "Quicktime movie".  I added "Kind contains 'video'" OR "Kind contains 'movie'" and it seems to be working now.
