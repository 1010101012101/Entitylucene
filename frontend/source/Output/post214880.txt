Why does not Calendar.app sync to exchange calendar on Mac OS X? <body> My problem is not this or this.   Error message: "emThere was an error saving ical data. Calendar App encountered a critical error while saving to the database, and recent changes may be lost. More information may be available in the console./em"  It is very similar to this question.  However my console log has such entries:  precode09.11.15 11:54:53,484 CalendarAgent[2263]: CoreData: XPC: Token mismatch 09.11.15 11:54:53,485 suggestd[379]: [com.apple.calendar.store.log.notifications] [There was an error when fetching NOBOs for principals: (Local) (error: Error Domain=NSCocoaErrorDomain Code=134095 "(null)" UserInfo={Problem=request failed, store identifier mismatch})] 09.11.15 11:54:53,488 CalendarAgent[2263]: CoreData: XPC: Token mismatch 09.11.15 11:54:53,489 suggestd[379]: [com.apple.calendar.store.log.notifications] [There was an error when fetching NOBOs for calendars: () (error: Error Domain=NSCocoaErrorDomain Code=134095 "(null)" UserInfo={Problem=request failed, store identifier mismatch})] /code/pre  When I setup my exchange account, first sync works good but after init sync it does not work anymore and I get this error. Well, when I deactivate my Exchange cal, delete all cache files and activate it again, it syncs for one time and then again not. But this is not a solution.   It seems like a bug - but I am not sure what to do now. Busycal costs 50â‚¬ and since Calendar.app is with Mac OS X, I thought they might fix this issue soon?  <answer214904> Since I deactivated rootless in my Mac OS X, calendar.app has no problems with sync to our Exchange server.  <answer216418> I found these steps on the Apple site and modified them - the modifications work.  ul liopen Calendar/li liCalendar - Accounts/li liDisable exchange calendars/li listrongReboot/strong/li /ul  Now re-enable  ul liopen Calendar/li liCalendar - Accounts/li liEnable exchange calendars/li /ul  <answer242348> Here is my solution: After deleting the Calendar caches as explained earlier it was still not Synching properly. Then I deleted all my Calendar items from the exchange account. I use for this Outlook for Mac, but you can probably use anything, just be sure to delete EVERYTHING from the calendar. It is now synchronizing perfectly between Mac Calendar, Outlook for Mac 2016, iPhone, etc. A little note: before deleting every Calendar item, I did an .OLM export. Unfortunately when I restore it back, it was missing a lot of appointment. I strongly suggest before the deletion, to export them one by one as .ICS files and or manually write them down somewhere. My best guess is that somewhere in the Calendar Exchange database there were a corrupted item, infact the OLM export-import will not work properly. I hope it helps Cheers  <comment261502> That's crazy - also you mention iCalc / is that a typo and/or are you really running a quite old OS X version with iCal instead of Calendar.app? <comment261508> Nope, new Macbook Pro & uptodate OSX. And why the heck is someone downvoting my question? -.- <comment261510> Sorry @bmike, I meant the Calendar App that is shipped with uptodate OSX. I'll update my question tmr. <comment261514> Insults are not welcome here. If one imaginary internet point causes you to curse at others, please take a break. <comment261527> It's disgusting to downvote and not to comment anything. And it's one real internet and a real issue that causes me to call this one like I did. I am a member of stackx for a long time and this is first time that such thing happend to me. StackX recommands to comment when you downvote. <comment261529> You can hold that opinion. We draw the line at insulting language and there isn't a requirement to comment, it is optional. The bar for downvote is not finding it useful which is highly subjective. <comment261530> How can someone that is not an .... think that my question is not useful? 99% of stackx content is not useful for me and I am not downvoting everything. But okay. Feel free to delete this whole conversation. I'll take this to meta. Thanks anyway for your response.
