Website Track App Store Price <body> I am looking or a website, which will monitor the price of an application on the Mac App Store and send me an email notification when the price of the application drops.  I have already tried appspy.com, but they did not send me email when the price dropped.  <answer50533> Try App Shopper. You need to register an account to utilize their price drop notification.   <answer63991> I use the Store News app (Mac App Store preview).   No notification, but if you're interested in a particular app: you can create a smart filter, then it should be easy to see at a glance whether a change has occurred.   There's also a simplified web interface to Store News but this doesn't allow creation of filters.
