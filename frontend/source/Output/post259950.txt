Time Machine keeps asking me to create a new backup, even after I fixed the sparsebundle <body> I repaired my Sparsebundle on my Time Machine server using these instructions. I edited the codecom.apple.TimeMachine.MachineID.plist/code file and the codecom.apple.TimeMachine.MachineID.bckup/code as one of the commenters on that post said that was necessary for his to backup to work again.  However, just moments after starting up the backup, I get the Time Machine error that my last verification failed and I need to create a new backup.  I checked my codeplist/code file and Time Machine changed the codeVerificationState/code from code0/code to code2/code, obviously without performing another verification.  It seems as if Time Machine is reverting to a previous codeplist/code file, or there are other places changes must be made to continue backups. I followed the steps exactly in the post, but still cannot backup to my sparsebundle.  I also tried removing the codeplist/code and codebckup/code files, re-running the backup, but the files were simply recreated nearly instantly, and moments later I got the same error that my last verification failed and I need to create a new backup.  I am running macOS Sierra. What could I be missing?  emOther users on Ask Different have suggested that my question is a duplicate of this question, but it is not. I understand why Time Machine initially asked me to create a new backup. I have found that many people have solved the initial problem by using these instructions, however there appears to be more to it. The top upvoted answer suggests I follow the same instructions I have already followed, and while I was able to repair the sparsebundle, my specific issue is that Time Machine does not recognize the codeplist/code setting reset and immediately asks me to create a new backup. strongThe question is why won't my codeplist/codesettings take affect and allow me to run a backup?/em/strong
