Impossible to get dual-boot of OS X 10.6/10.11 to work <body> I've seen and read the other similar bootable installation questions on partitions questions on the forum and my problem is not close to being addressed, so this is challenging. I am not an expert and of extremely basic knowledge using terminal.  I need to have both El Capitan and Snow Leopard Bootable Partitions  Tried the same process in 3 computers (Mac Pro (Early 2008 2 x 2.8 GHz Quad-Core Intel Xeon and iMac 2009, 2011) and several drives as listed below, stating up with El Capitan and Snow Leopard as startup drives  Partitioned both a Seagate Expansion 4TB (3 separate drives), Backup Plus hub 8TB and WD My passport 4TB drives HFS extended GTP (GUID) partition setup. Used both Disk Utilities, iPartition and Drive Genius. Repaired disk and disk permissions with Disk Utilities and Drive Genius. Same exact results in all the drives, which are USB 3 with USB 2 compatibility.  What I have done:  ul liErased, and formatted as HFS Journaled. Partition scheme is GUID (GPT)/li liInstalling OS X Snow Leopard: Installed OS X Snow Leopard from Installer disk/li liProceeded to find out blessed state of the partitions. Partition info seemed ok on the bless path/li liCarbon copied bootable functional Snow Leopard Drives/li /ul  Result:  Some partitions proceeded to completion  ul liNo problem/li /ul  Others got stuck on restarted white screen forever  ul liRestarting did not finish the process/li liLetting it stay on white screen for a whole day did not finish the process/li liUsed these terminal commands: codebless --info "/Volumes/MyDrivesName"/code  precode[MyMac-4:~] silver% bless --info "/Volumes/MySnowLeopardPartition” finderinfo[0]:    409 =&gt; Blessed System Folder is /Volumes/MySnowLeopardPartition/System/Library/CoreServices finderinfo[1]: 455009 =&gt; Blessed System File is /Volumes/MySnowLeopardPartition/System/Library/CoreServices/boot.efi    finderinfo[2]:      0 =&gt; Open-folder linked list empty finderinfo[3]:      0 =&gt; No alternate OS blessed file/folder finderinfo[4]:      0 =&gt; Unused field unset     finderinfo[5]:    409 =&gt; OS X blessed folder is /Volumes/MySnowLeopardPartition/System/Library/CoreServices 64-bit VSDB volume id:  111111111111111111 /code/pre/li /ul  I get the same info for the disk I am using now, which is bootable and functional, therefore I assume that it is telling me that the blessed state of the partition-drive is ok  precodesudo bless --folder "/Volumes/MyDrivesName/System/Library/CoreServices” bless --bootinfo "/Volumes/MyDrivesName/Library/CoreServices”      /code/pre  This just gets a reply that says Unmatched  Carbon copied otherwise boottable drive to completion (the same drive to several partitions)  ul liSome where bootable     are selectable in System Preferences Startup Disk     appear at Start up manager (option at startup)/li liOthers seem identical to the source bootable but won’t boot     are selectable in System Preferences Startup Disk     do not appear at Start up manager (option at startup)/li /ul  All the non bootable drives that where completed:  ul liSystem Preferences Start Up disk selection: They all are selectable/li liStart up manager (holding option key) the non bootable partitions do not appear as options/li /ul  All the non bootable drives that where not completed:  ul liHave only user “shared"/li /ul  Option-Shift-Command-Period at the Startup Manager window did not make a difference  The same scenario applied to OS X El Capitan installation  hr  Talked to Apple Support and they said that El Capitan and Snow Leopard don’t work well together and can’t install both.  I have installed both, on the same drive, different partitions.   Talked to Seagate: It’s Apple’s problem  <comment349303> I tried to fix your fixes (to show you how the bullet points work) - some details related to the formatting are still unclear at least to me. [Editing help](http://apple.stackexchange.com/editing-help) <comment349304> hmm... I tried to replace the bullets with the dashes but it came back to bullets... strange. I will try again. <comment349305> Thaks for your helping with this. I hope I am not upsetting  people since I am grateful for the assistance. <comment349306> several dashes in several rows are converted to bullet points automatically!. In the edit window they still appear as dashes though
