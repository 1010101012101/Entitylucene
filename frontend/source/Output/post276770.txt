Mac not connecting to Internet, but Safari is connecting to Internet <body> Have this weird wireless network, once the mac connected to the network, everything except safari shows offline (Skype, Spotify, Dropbox and other apps) an even when I codeping google.com/code or codeping 8.8.8.8/code all results in timeout.  But for some weird reason safari can still browse internet for known domains, and soon as I try to resolve an unknown domain, it can't find that host.   Pretty sure this is an DNS issue, but none of the other devices in the network has this issue. I tried flushing DNS of the mac, and using google DNSs but no luck  Can't even reset the mac to factory settings without a internet connection at this point   <comment348405> Can you edit your question to include the model of modem/router you're using and how it's configured? Also, what version of macOS are you using? <comment348406> What do you mean by known or unknown domain? <comment348407> OP! Please elaborate on "But for some weird reason safari can still browse internet for known domains, and soon as I try to resolve an unknown domain, it can't find that host." <comment348409> You've asked the same question twice. Only ask it once.
