Cannot open OpenOffice because the developer is not certified <body> Since the update to Mac OS 10.11.6 the security preferences are not working properly. I'm trying to open OpenOffice and, even though I have disabled limitations, it is refusing to open and keeps telling me that the settings need changing.  <answer265105> After failing to open the app, go to System Preferences - Security. It should refer to blocking openOffice and give you an option to open it.  <answer265113> instead of clicking on the app select open then it opens  <comment332379> hm, it seems that downloading and reinstalling again and opening via context menu might be a workaround for this. <comment332399> It did have the option and I did click on it. It made no difference. As noted above I had to reinstall the program and go through the hoops several times even though I had all restrictions disabled. <comment332400> Except that isn't what happened. <comment332411> May I suggest to change to LibreOffice? Never had such kind of problems, including the latest version. <comment332458> Welcome to Ask Different!

I do have LibreOffice installed but I find it less stable than OpenOffice and it has a worse UI.
