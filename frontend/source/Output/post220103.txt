Export mailbox tree structure into folders with files in .eml format <body> My university e-mail account has only 500MB of space, and I want to export and archive old mails on an external hard drive.  I want to export a mailbox (a year of e-mails actually) that has a tree structure of "sub-mailboxes" into folder and sub-folders with the same structure; containing e-mails in the .eml format (with attachements included of course).  ol li"export mailbox..." isn't appropriate since it stores e-mails in .mbox format/li liselect the desired mailboxes  select all e-mails  drag-and-drop in a folder works, but doesn't keep the tree structure./li /ol  Maybe I should just make the folder tree structure manually and then drag-and-drop e-mails where desired, but that's not the computer scientist's way!  I found this Apple script but it basically does the same thing than drag-and-drop; it just puts a nice file name.
