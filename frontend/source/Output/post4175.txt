How do I change the playback speed in iTunes? <body> On the iPhone I can speed up the playback of podcasts to 2x.br Is there a way to do the same in iTunes?    <answer4214> This is not natively possible in the Mac version of iTunes (nor Windows for the matter). You don’t mention if you have OS X or Windows. If you have the former, you have two choices:   1) If the podcast is an MP3 file, you can convert the file to an AAC file in iTunes (with an extension of m4a.) and then change the extension to m4b; the file becomes an audiobook which can be played faster if I am not mistaken.  2) Another alternative is to hear it in Quicktime, which has speed controls: Right click the file in iTunes and choose "Show In Finder”. Option-click the file (right click) and select “Open With…”, select QuickTime. Once in Quicktime option-click the "Accelerate" button to change the playback speed.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iwyIS.jpg" alt="QuickTime"  <answer4230> Soundforge nits free and it will change tempo without changing pitch. It works well.   <answer54828> You can use Winamp or Windows Media Player and the Chronotron plugin to change tempo or pitch.  <answer94054> There is an Mac menubar app, that allows you to to change the playbackspeed in iTunes. http://wetfish.de/software/speedup/  <answer129824> The way I did it was (windows 7 not sure how it would work on mac) copy and paste the podcast from itunes into my doccuments and then open the podcast in VLC (http://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-windows.html) i assume there is a download for Mac as well. VLC has speed controls and plays every type of file as far as im aware. Under the playback options it has a speed setting.   NB VLC also good for vidoes with out of sync A/V as has sync settings.   <comment4041> How did you highlight the pause button and do the circle on the next/accelerate butotn on the image? It's brilliant! :D <comment4042> @JFW Meet http://skitch.com/ for the “circle/arrow/text”. The Highlight is a courtesy of Apple Inc. that decided to add that feature automatically on Quicktime X ;) <comment4176> I now tried both methods. For the audiobook I didn't find a way to play it faster. The solution with Quicktime works but it seems to be even faster than 2x. <comment4177> Can you add a little more detail (e.g. a link for that tool)? Seems Google is not my friend here as it only brings up a tool that is not free. <comment44075> Yes, please add more detail to your answer. <comment62856> Welcome to Ask Different! Can you add a little detail to this? Where can we get the plugin and how can we use it to change pitch? Please take a look at the [FAQs](http://apple.stackexchange.com/faq) for more info. Thanks. <comment62960> What platform are you on, Mac or Windows? <comment303798> Hold Option and click Accelerate to get 1.1x, 1.2x, 1.3x, ... Intuitive really!
