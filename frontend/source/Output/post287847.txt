Get ALL Voice Memos in iTunes on iPhone 7 <body> I'm trying to get all 203 of my voice memos into one place in iTunes on my iPhone 7 (either artist/album or playlist) so I can shuffle play them all. But no matter how I do it, I can only get 50 of them to show up on my phone.  I can see and play all 203 of them in the "Voice Memos" playlist in my computer based iTunes library, I've got "include voice memos" checked in my phone settings in iTunes, and I can see all 203 of them in the "voice memos" playlist under my phone's music tab on my computer's iTunes.  But no matter how I try to do it, I can't seem to get more than the first 50 to show up with proper names.   I've tried making multiple 50 track playlists, and they will appear populated on the computer, but then on my phone only the first one will have the 50 tracks, and the rest will be blank.  Tried creating a smart playlist.  All the same.  Looks proper on the computer, doesn't show past 50 on the phone.  If I go directly to the files in finder and then copy them back into a playlist in iTunes, I do end up able to access all 203 memos, but they don't have their proper track titles, just some sort of voice memo code, which isn't very helpful.  How can I get all of them in one place that I can play like a regular music player on my phone??  Thank you!
