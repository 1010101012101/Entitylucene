Can I configure Messages for Mac to receive messages sent to my phone number? <body> Is it possible to configure Messages for Mac in such a way that it receives text messages sent to my mobile phone number?  Currently on the Mac I can receive only messages sent to my Apple ID, but on my iPhone I can receive messages sent to both.  <answer57451> In iOS 6, your phone number and your Apple ID will be unified, so when you'll receive a iMessage or a Facetime call, they will appear on all your devices (iOS and Mac OS).  More info here.   So I think you just need to wait until this fall to resolve your problem !   <comment65997> I'm really wishing iOS 6 and ML were released at the same time.
