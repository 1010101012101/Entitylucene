Messages won't send in jabber group chat <body> I am using Messages to access my company chat server, which is using the Jabber protocol.  This works fine, and in amongst my iMessage messages, SMS etc, are conversations with my colleagues.  I can chat to my heart's content with individual colleagues.  However, when I connect to a chat room ("Go to Chat Room..."), I get the following strange symptoms: I can connect ok to the room. I can see others talking. I can see messages I type myself BUT no-one else can see these messages.  I connected to the chat room using another client (Adium), and start typing.  These Adium messages show up in Messages, and my colleague can see them too.  He can also see that I am in the chat room twice.  But messages I type in Messages are not showing up in the Adium client, or for anyone else in the chat room.  The obvious answer is to switch to Adium.  This would be fine.  But it seems to me there's a bug in Messages, isn't there?
