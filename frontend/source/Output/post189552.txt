FaceTime calls lower system volume <body> When you enter a FaceTime call in OS X, as of Mavericks, it lowers the volume of everything else besides the call. There's no way to disable this "feature." People here suggested disabling audio ducking in Voiceover Utility, but that doesn't have any effect, at least not in Yosemite.  Any suggestions for a hack solution to fix this? I don't want to install some system-wide audio mixer to help, but I'll happily mess with the FaceTime application or some system settings. I'm guessing there's some library it's using to control the system volume, and I'm trying to find a way to prevent the app bundle from accessing it.  <answer202986> Go into the "Voiceover Utility", go to the "Sound" tab and uncheck "Enable audio ducking" checkbox.   <answer223023> Open FaceTime app (don't make the call yet), Paste the following line in to terminal,  precodeprintf "p *(char*)(void(*)())AudioDeviceDuck=0xc3\nq" | lldb -n FaceTime /code/pre  and then make the call.  <comment270394> Comex posted this one on Twitter. <comment279702> I just get `current process state is unsuitable for expression parsing` when I try this. <comment287648> That only applies to the Voiceover Utility... <comment305444> I get `error: attach failed: cannot attach to process due to System Integrity Protection` when trying this. <comment309959> +1 to @duncanc4, System Integrity Protection renders this hack completely useless. <comment357442> error: attach failed: cannot attach to process due to System Integrity Protection
