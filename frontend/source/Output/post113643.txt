File selector list not starting at the top <body> When I go to attach a document in mail, I press the attach button, and the file selector dialog opens. However, the list starts 3 or 4 items from the top, so I have to scroll up a little to see the first few (and then back down to see the rest).  Any ideas what would cause this and how I would fix it?  <answer113655> Do you have any third party software installed that messes with the finder dialogs? Default Folder, Boomarang, etc.  When in doubt:  Quit all applications. Cycle power on the computer. Repair permissions and repair the disk. Delete preferences for that application.  <comment133348> What OS version do you have?
