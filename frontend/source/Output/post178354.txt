Which iOS calendar apps support iCalendar over TLS with client certificate authentication? <body> For a long time, I have accessed my calendars (iCalendar format, code*.ics/code) via WebDAV over TLS with client certificate authentication.  I now want to provide access to my calendars to another person who uses an iPhone.  I have issued a client certificate and installed it on the phone, but (on strongiOS 7/strong) when setting up the calendar account it  demands a username and passphrase. I enter bogus values to satisfy the form, but then it fails to connect via TLS anyway.  Does the calendar app in strongiOS 8/strong support iCalendar over WebDAV with TLS client certificate authentication?  If not, which calendar apps support this (free software vastly preferred)?
