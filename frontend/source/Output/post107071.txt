How can I use the Pages Full Screen in the old way? <body> I just updated to Mac Maverick and updated Pages. The question is I just can't get used to it, I don't the exact words to describe it. In the past, when in the Full Screen modem, I am typing in floating whiteboard in the whole darkness, which is awesome.  How can I do that in the newest version of Pages now?  <answer107710> First, click on "Setup" to toggle the Setup pane off (if it is on).  Then two finger click on the toolbar, and select "Hide Toolbar".  <comment126421> I just made a silly mistake,http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/107804/how-to-recover-my-texts
