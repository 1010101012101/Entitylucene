Are they safe? (I mean still present and accessible in Mail.app?) <comment344045> I'm not certain if you restore the entire thing - I've seen guides that state it will restore to a new folder called 'Recovered Messages', but you can restore individual mails as well as the entire thing. If things go weird, you're still backed up to no more than an hour ago with Time Machine at default settings. <comment344079> @Tetsujin thanks, I'll try it out
