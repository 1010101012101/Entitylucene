What are "nwnode:" URLs, and why did Lion break them? <body> After installing OS X 10.7, Dropbox presented the following error upon loading: "URLs with the type "nwnode:" are not supported". I also got this error from Path Finder (although I don't know what I did to cause it).  Both applications only gave me the error once and have not done it since.  What are nwnode: URLs? What purpose did they serve? And why did Lion stop supporting them?  img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/2044/nwnode_error.png" alt="URLs with the type 'nwnode:' are not supported" /  <answer19933> The Dropbox forum has a topic on this with a suggestion to install the latest build of Dropbox.  I can't speak directly to that other than to say that my Dropbox install was up to date on Snow Leopard when I upgraded to Lion last week and it continued to work. I'd certainly agree with the suggestion of getting on the latest Dropbox as a first step.  <answer37576> The error occurs when an application using Python symbol mappings in Mac OS X is not able to connect to a (previously) networked drive, Time Machine, Bonjour, shared or remote drives, etc. (nwnode). It's a depreciated method, which mostly is why Lion displays the error. Even if you don't use Time Machine, this error can occur, either from an os upgrade or app that uses Python (Dropbox in this case).  Usually the issues can be resolved by following these steps (via Apple):   strongResolution/strong  ol liIn the Finder, double-click on your hard disk./li liOpen the folder named System./li liOpen the Library folder./li liOpen the Filesystems folder./li liDrag the folder named "URLMount (from old Mac)" to your desktop as a precautionary backup./li liOnce the copy is complete, control-click the original "URLMount (from old Mac)" folder (not the one on your desktop) and choose "Move to Trash" from the contextual menu./li liEnter the name and password of an administrator if prompted. The first user account created on your Mac is an administrator account./li liRestart./li /ol  http://support.apple.com/kb/TS1736  *note: The question above was posted six months ago, although I decided to answer it today simply because nobody seemed to know the answer. Hopefully someone who reads this will understand what the error means now.  And just for Bryson, here is just one of it's strings in symbol_mappings.py:  precode'__ZN17SharePointBrowser18setConnectionStateE21NWNodeConnectionState' :  'SharePointBrowser.o', /code/pre  <comment21976> I have the same problem! Maybe Dropbox needs an update? <comment22459> But what is an nwnode: url? <comment22462> I'd assume it's a custom URI created by Dropbox for internal purposes. <comment24645> I don't think this is specific to Dropbox. I don't have Dropbox installed on my iMac, but encountered this exact same error when installing SyncPad. I would really like to know what nwnode is and how/why Lion broke it. <comment25721> I experience the problem with more than just Dropbox. I also had an issue with Path Finder. <comment28482> Is Path Finder "Dropbox-aware"? Anything that leverages Dropbox in some fashion may, in theory, use the nwnode: identifier. <comment57410> When I follow your steps, on step5, I can't find URlMount on my mac lion. Is this something that I should ask a new question or is it an easy suggestion to address here in comments? <comment57685> @Max, when/where does the error occur? the fix instructions above are specific to migration issues from an older Mac to a newer one. Feel free to ask questions or comment anytime you haven't found the answer to something.
