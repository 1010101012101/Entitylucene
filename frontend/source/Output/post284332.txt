Mac shuts down after loading bar loads 50% <body> I purchased a new Mac (Apple iMac MK142LL/A - Intel Core i5, 1.6Ghz, 21.5 Inch LED, 8GB, 1TB, Intel HD Graphics 6000, OS X El Capitan). It worked fine the first day.   Since today, when I try to start the iMac, it shuts down automatically after the loading bar loads 50% in the grey screen. After that it will not start until I unplug the power cable and plug again. Same thing again and again.  <answer284375> This is something that you should absolutely contact Apple about since it is a brand new Mac - it is under warranty and will be replaced, if it's in the first 14 days you can even return it to the Apple store &amp; get a brand new one (or your money back) with absolutely no questions asked.  If you do want to troubleshoot this, try to boot in verbose mode by holding command+v during startup - take a picture &amp; post it as a comment here.  <comment358598> If it's a new Mac it'll be covered by Apple's global warranty. I would not hesitate to contact Apple for support. In the meantime you could try starting in [Safe Mode](https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT201262) to see if that makes a difference. <comment358632> What happens if you go into Disk Repair? You might need a hard drive replacement.
