Missing icons on macOS Sierra <body> I'm on macOS Sierra and I have been losing icons randomly, as you can see below, the Adobe Illustrator folder does not look like it should.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/14qjM.png" alt="enter image description here"  This also occurs in the Dock:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AHwut.png" alt="enter image description here"  FaceTime (left of iTunes) has no icon, this also occurs with numerous other applications such as Inkscape, Gimp, and a few others.  Please help!  <answer293669> I had to run the below commands to make my icons come back. It took a while to find, but it finally sorted everything.   precodesudo find /private/var/folders/ -name com.apple.iconservices -exec rm -rf {} \; sudo rm -rf /Library/Caches/com.apple.iconservices.store killall Dock /code/pre  <comment339058> Try restarting Finder (ï£¿ - Force Quit - Finder) or using terminal to restart the dock with `killall Dock`. <comment339059> And try restarting your computer, [clear NVRAM/SMC](http://www.macworld.com/article/2881177/how-to-reset-your-macs-nvram-pram-and-smc.html), etc. <comment340636> The restarting finder didn't work, I'll try resetting nvram
