Why does OS X Terminal say KUMAR now? <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2Jzgl.png" alt="Prompt says KUMAR"  Is anyone else seeing this on their terminal?   There's no other weird behavior to indicate I've been hacked.    <comment324631> My terminal doesn't say that.  Did you let anyone use your Mac or login to an unsecured wifi recently? <comment324633> I've used a lot of coffeeshop wifi's but not had other people use it. <comment324636> Nice find, @Tetsujin!
