OS Sierra update corrupted $PATH, .bash_profile, .bashrc <body> Sierra update corrupted code$PATH/code, code.bash_profile/code, code.bashrc/code, and many others. Is this a common issue? Is there any way to get those files/settings back (I don't have a backup)? In the past I often installed new OSs and everything was fine.  <comment320725> If you do not have a backup then you'll have to manually recreate the information within the files. There is no good excuse for not maintaining regular backups and especially a backup before a major upgrade! <comment320726> Sierra doesn't install ~/.bash* files. Please post the content of the files if they are not just garbage (JSK|[™Ω  Gb etc.) <comment320741> Off-topic but one suggestion to prevent is to setup a git repository preferably on github, and add those dot files inside the repo, and symlink it back to $HOME, so you always have a backup of those configs. <comment320753> I suggest to change your question title for a question. For example "How to analyze a PATH misbehaviour?". You might get more appropriate help.
