Password issue on iPhone 6s saying password is too short <body> When I try and change my iPhone 6s password I click "custom numeric password" and I type in a 3 digit code and it says "make password longer". Then it would be a 4 digit code and that's not what I want.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cmOU1.png" width="280"   <answer285463> The strongminimum passcode length/strong for custom numeric passcodes is strongfour characters/strong. The same applies for custom alphanumeric passcodes.  I've also tried this on an iPhone 6s running iOS 10.3.2.  If you want a passcode that's easier to type (which I don't recommend) you may want to use repeating numbers (e.g. 1122 or 2255).  <comment359972> Try clicking "passcode options" I'm pretty sure there should be a custom option. <comment359975> You can try what @Joonas said...but I would say 4 digits is a tad more secure ;) <comment359982> My guess is that "custom" was never meant to mean "shorter". As the default is now 6 digits, presumably the old minimum of 4 still stands. <comment359989> Just to clarify, prior to getting the screen above do you first see the _This passcode can be easily guessed_ message with the 'Use Anyway' option? <comment359995> The 'Use Anyway' option _looks_ like it would let you use a 1-3 character password but iOS still requires the passcode to be at least four characters/numbers long. @Monomeeth
