Does Whatsapp Save Incoming Media feature create duplicates? <body> I would like to know if the strongSave Incoming Media/strong feature in Whatsapp strongemcreate duplicates/em/strong i.e. saved in both Whatsapp application data and also Camera roll?  <answer267922> Yes, it does duplicate media in the sense you describe. With that switch activated, all incoming images will have 2 copies: one on the app and one on the Camera Roll.  <answer267923> To answer your comment, not so much the ability to auto-delete, but switching it off prevents it from being copied to Camera Roll - you'll have to manually delete the message in order to delete the media.  <comment336251> Is there a way to auto delete that data? <comment336276> Not that I know of.
