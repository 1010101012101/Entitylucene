Move a bunch of ical events at once <body> I have got all the dates and times for my class seminars set in iCal, and I've also made week-long events that coincide with my colleges week numbering.   The thing is, I forgot to let out this Easter holidays, which are two weeks that should be blank.   What I want to do is select all events and move them two weeks. How can I do that?  <answer12967> iCal cannot do this by itself unfortunately.  There is a $8 shareware program called Calibrate that can do bulk moves of iCal events.  There is a trial period to ensure it does what you want.
