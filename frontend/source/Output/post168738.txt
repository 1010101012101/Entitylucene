How do I put my macbook back into case-insensitive? <body> Recently wiped my macbook due to a virus, and apparently I wasn't reading things clearly because I managed to end up in 'emcase-sensitive/em' mode [mode?] which evidently means I cannot install League of Legends.  Please, someone, tell me how to fix this... Hoping I won't have to repeat the wipeout and start again... it was a tad inconvenient. [took three and a half hours to reinstall Mavericks last time]  <comment249384> Do we mean http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/15080/convert-a-partition-from-case-sensitive-to-case-insensitive?
