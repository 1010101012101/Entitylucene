Time machine backup only on home network <body> I've set up my Ubuntu server at home to act as a Time capsule using this guide: http://alisnic.net/blog/use-a-ubuntu-as-a-timemachine-server/  It works very well, and I have two macbooks backing up like crazy when i'm connected to the WIFI at home.   The problem is that Time machine on the macbooks keeps notifying me of how many hours/days it has been since the last backup when i'm not on my WIFI at home.   How can I make Time machine only look for the backup disk when I'm connected to a WIFI with a specific SSID?
