Numbers shortcut to select next non-empty cell <body> I have just purchased my first Mac and am having problems with Numbers. I want to select the next cell in a given direction that is non-empty (or jump to the end of a contiguous chunk of cells that are non-empty). In Excel (on Windows, anyway), you can do this with kbdCtrl/kbd + kbdAn Arrow Key/kbd. For example, in this little spreadsheet:  precode    A    B    C    D 1   x              x 2        x         x 3   x    x    x 4   x    x    x    x /code/pre  if you selected cell A1 and pressed kbdCtrl/kbd+kbd↓/kbd, you would jump to A3. If, instead, you pressed kbdCtrl/kbd+kbd→/kbd, you would have gone to D1. If you were in A3 when you pressed kbdCtrl/kbd+kbd→/kbd, it would take you to C3.  On my Mac, kbdControl/kbd + kbdOption/kbd + kbdArrow Key/kbd does what I want in Google Spreadsheets. I tried that combination in Numbers, but it  adds a row or column, instead.   Surely there is a way to do this in Numbers; I just can't figure it out. Are there keyboard shortcuts like this in Numbers? If not, is there a way to map a keyboard shortcut to this functionality?
