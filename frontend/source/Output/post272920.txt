How do I turn off the Screen Saver? <body> Can't believe that I have to ask this question, but...  How to I disable the screen saver on my 2014 MacBook Pro, running MacOS Sierra 10.12?  I have a need occasionally to keep the screen display on, but I might not use it for 20 minutes at a time. I want to disable the screen saver, but the button to adjust the time (I presume it has a 'None' option) is disabled.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mk5XC.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  How can I enable that dropdown, in order to change the 'Start after' time? Or is there somewhere else I should change it?  I know that I can use hot corners to disable screen saver, but that's too hacky - if I forget to put the cursor in the corner, it doesn't do it, and I only know when the screen saver comes on - which is frustrating.  <answer272923> Check out this discussion: Screensaver "start time" option grayed out     ul   liThe system administrator has probably set the screensaver timeout in a user profile. You can't change it without removing the profile, which will probably cause you to lose network access./li   liCheck if you have a profile (overriding your personal settings) by AppleSystem Prefs  there you should have a profile button/li   liif you have a profile, one of these files has it's settings: ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/ look for a file with a long name that begins "com.apple.screensaver". There may be two such files. Move the one  without the word "slideshow" in the name to the Trash./li   /ul   It most probably applies to your problem too...  <comment343059> Welcome to AskDifferent!

Found that corporate had put a setting in the profile forcing a screenscaver timeout; I can take it up with them now. <comment343074> You're very welcome PeteCon. @n1000: somebody did, but thanks for giving me hope into humanity by affirming it hadn't been you. <comment343082> SE can sometimes be a rough place in the beginning.
