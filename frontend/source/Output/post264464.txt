macOS Preview has graphical glitch when copying using rectangular selection <body> Whenever I open a .pdf (haven't tried with other formats) with many pages (at least  5), Preview does this really annoying thing:  I use the Rectangular Selection tool to select an area of the .pdf I want to copy. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/utm6i.png" alt="rectangular selection area"  When I copy, the page does this: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WZ8jA.png" alt="upon command+c, this happens (only for .pdfs that are many pages/large size)"  When I click the area off, then I can see the page again. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fQqCg.png" alt="as soon as I click again, it goes back to normal..."  Because I tend to make flashcards/store several selections of what I copied with the Rectangular Selection, I'd like to know what I can do to solve this issue.  Some useful information: I'm using macOS Sierra beta. I understand that this means I'll probably encounter more bugs than someone that isn't using the beta, but before installing a Release Candidate, I figured I could learn some stuff. I've tried deleting the .plists for Preview with no luck. When I zoom into the page (after pressing kbd⌘c/kbd and the weirdness happening), the page probably re-renders and the problem goes away. If I press kbd⌘c/kbd while zoomed in, the weirdness ensues.   Any advice on how to reinstall/format the app before that doesn't require a new installation would be much appreciated!  <comment331424> There's probably no reason to reinstall the OS. If you can reproduce this issue with the same document on a new user account, maybe file a bug report with Apple - openradar.appspot.com has some details on filing bugs. <comment331541> Sierra is already on 10.12.1 Try that first.
