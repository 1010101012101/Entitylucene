Disable password authentication on SSH server on OS X Server 10.8 <body> I want to disable the password authentication of the SSH server on my OS X Server. this should be done in /etc/sshd_config, right? But I’m not sure which setting I should change…  <answer84574> As any BSD system you should toggle off some options in your sshd_config like I've described in this Stack Overflow answer:  precodeUsePam yes # it will not be used ChallengeResponseAuthentication no PasswordAuthentication no kbdInteractiveAuthentication no /code/pre  <answer167405> In case it helps, I was having trouble with this on 10.10 (Yosemite) and it turned out I was editing the wrong file.  code/etc/sshd_config/code is the right one, not code/etc/ssh/sshd_config/code, which is what I was trying based on what codeman sshd_config/code says:  precodeSSHD_CONFIG(5)              BSD File Formats Manual             SSHD_CONFIG(5)  NAME      sshd_config -- OpenSSH SSH daemon configuration file  SYNOPSIS      /etc/ssh/sshd_config  DESCRIPTION      sshd(8) reads configuration data from /etc/ssh/sshd_config ... /code/pre  <comment97365> I can’t find kbdInteractiveAutentication. The options have a # at the beginning of the line. Should I remove them? <comment97374> the # sign before lines tells about default values. kbdInteractiveAutentication seems to be deprecated but may be used. <comment97726> @SebastianSemmler is this answer is helpful for you? <comment98290> no, still can login via password <comment98328> You have to restart remote login <comment110167> it still doesn’t work. I don’t know, what I do wrong. Should I post any configs? <comment192605> I am somewhat annoyed to discover that my upgrade to Yosemite caused sshd_config to have commented out the modifications I made to it (modifications similar to this) -- what about kbdInteractiveAuthentication? Should I add it or not? <comment257096> Since 10.11 `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` - right path <comment263384> @Speakus this was a problem for me, as upgrading to 10.11 meant that password authentication was reenabled and I didn't catch it for a couple months.
