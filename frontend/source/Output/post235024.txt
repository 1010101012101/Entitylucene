How to fix bootcamp boot after removing hybrid MBR <body> I've updated bootcamp to Windows 10 which should support GPT with protective MBR without any hybrid tricks. I have 6 partitions on disk0 so hybrid MBR is also inconsistent with GPT and it's somewhat dangerous.   I've used gdisk to remove hybrid MBR but now Windows can't boot with "No bootable device ..." error on black screen. I've tried to use windows rescue disc and run codebcdboot C:\Windows /s C: /f UEFI/code and codebootrec /fixmbr/code (this one returns an error) but it doesn't help.  What am I missing? Should I put windows BCD to Windows or EFI partition? I use rEFInd as boot manager.  precodeRomans-MacBook-Pro:Microsoft root# diskutil list /dev/disk0 (internal, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            120.8 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             1.3 GB     disk0s3    4:       Microsoft Basic Data System                  215.4 GB   disk0s4    5:       Microsoft Basic Data Data                    608.0 GB   disk0s5    6:       Microsoft Basic Data Var                     54.7 GB    disk0s6  Romans-MacBook-Pro:Microsoft root# gdisk -l /dev/disk0 GPT fdisk (gdisk) version 1.0.1   Warning: Devices opened with shared lock will not have their partition table automatically reloaded!

Did you do a clean install or upgrade from a previous version of Windows. If previous, which version. Which version OS X are you running? I also have 3 NTFS partitions on my iMac, but I am still using hybrid MBR/EFI partitioning. The total number of partitions on my iMac is 9. <comment287423> Macbook Pro late 2013. Upgraded from Win 7 to Win 10, then tried to remove hybrid MBR. OS X El Capitan.
