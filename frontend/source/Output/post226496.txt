OK so I've located the "silent'" button <body> Can't hear ringtones. Volume is up with buttons on left. Silent button shows red line. Does this mean it's on or off?  Thanks, padres  <answer226514> If your "Silent" button is showing the red line, your ringer is off. Flick it upwards (towards the screen) and your ringer should be on.  <comment275051> Try to flick it back and forth. What does the screen show?
