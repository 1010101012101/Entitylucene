How do I get Safari to stop launching an app automatically? <body> I upgraded my iPhone to iOS 7. Previously, when I clicked on a link from an e-mail telling me about a group discussion in LinkedIn, it opened LinkedIn in  Safari and took me right there. Now, Safari launches, but then as it processes, it then launches the LinkedIn app. The problem is, most times the discussion in LinkedIn is really just a link to a webpage. I'd rather just stay in Safari, especially since the LinkedIn app takes forever to load. I'm sure Safari does this with other apps, however, the circumstances haven't come up yet for me. I can't find it in the Safari settings or LinkedIn settings to stop this.  Updated to add:  I have found that if I go back to Safari after it tries launching LinkedIn and force a page refresh, Safari will load the mobile (rather than app) version of LinkedIn as desired.  <answer105002> I would uninstall the LinkedIn app. That would solve the issue - however you may not want to do that.  LinkedIn data mines your phone, contacts and emails, I use linkedIn but do not trust the company.  <answer105011> Just use the workaround you found - going back to Safari after it tries launching LinkedIn and force a page refresh so that it loads the mobile (rather than app) version of LinkedIn.  Also contact LinkedIn about the slowness you see in the app.  But if you want the choice of not uninstalling the app and trying other solutions, then there is at least one very tedious (really, really tedious) way to deal with it. I'm listing these here more as an exercise in imagination (and humor) than as practical solutions.  ol liOne tedious way is to tap on the link, and the moment you're in Safari hit the stop (x), modify the initial part to strongm.linkedin.com//strong to go to the mobile site. I'm not sure if this works well all the time. You can also do this by copying the link, pasting it in Safari and modifying it./li liAnother tedious way is to follow this routine every time you open your mail:  ul liTurn on Restrictions from strongSettings  General  Restrictions/strong and set a passcode./li liScroll down, go to strongApps/strong and tap strongDon't Allow Apps/strong. This will hide all apps you've installed, including LinkedIn./li liSwitch to or open Mobile Safari, use the links and stay within Mobile Safari./li liWhen done, exit Safari./li liGo to strongSettings  General  Restrictions/strong and turn it off using the passcode you set earlier./li liContinue using other apps./li /ul/li /ol  <answer216803> This also irritates me on iOS 9 which more aggressively tries to 'convert' urls to apps. Which is especially annoying on the iPad pro as the YouTube app cannot run partial screen at all, whereas a YouTube tab in Safari can. So the app is a worse experience.  The workaround of strongtapping cancel to the 'open this in the YouTube app' prompt then refreshing the tab/strong does work for me, though.  If there is a better way to handle this in iOS 9 or later leave a comment and I can edit this answer to improve it -- or suggest an edit.  <answer219712> In iOS 9, I've had success doing a long tap on the link and selecting "Open" from the pop-up menu. That opens a link and keeps it in Safari rather than jumping into an app (recently tested with an IMDB link from Google search results).  <answer241924> Settings  general  handoff &amp; suggested apps  turn off suggested apps  Worked for me  <answer261471> The easiest way to stop this automatic app launching in the browser is to hold down link until the action window pops up and then press "Open in New Tab"   <comment123507> Thank you, but that is not the route I was looking for. <comment123509> @JayMarshallWolman This is the non-jailbreak solution since iOS 7 increases the ability of apps to ask for URL to be handed to them directly instead of ending in Mobile Safari. Unless Apple adds a layer for you to disable these URL handlers on a per-app basis or you have an MDM solution that lets you configure / limit open-in activity. <comment123510> That's disappointing.  I'd much rather have the choice. <comment123516> mods - feel free to delete this answer if it's not appropriate for this site. <comment123740> I've actually opted to stick with my workaround. URL modification and the clever, tedious option both took longer than going back to Safari and refreshing. <comment123804> As mentioned in the answer, they were meant as an exercise in imagination and humor, while pointing to some limitations of iOS in this particular context. :) <comment297378> Welcome to Ask Different.
