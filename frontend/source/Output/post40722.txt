Why does an uninstalled Canon LBP 5050 printer keep reappearing? <body> I used to have a Canon LBP 5050. It is no longer connected to the network or the Mac. I removed the printer from: "System Preferences â†’ Printers" and even removed the codeppd/code from code/Library/Printers/code, using Terminal, but for some reason it constantly reinstalls itself every time I reboot my machine.  As far as I can tell there is no special Canon software installed or gets "called up" as a logon item.  Does anyone have any ideas?  <answer62570> Somewhat of a hidden feature, you might want to try resetting the printing system.  ul liGo to the Print and Scan preference pane./li liRight click in the list of available printers (mine's empty)./li liSelect "Reset printing system..."./li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kYPeF.png" alt="print and scan prefpane"  <comment67293> How was the printer connected?
