Can't view iCloud shared photo album on icloud.com <body> Yesterday, I created a new iCloud shared photo album from my Macbook and invited some people to this album. I can see the album from my iphone and of course from my macbook as well. However, when I logged in to my icloud.com account today, the album is not visible there. Is it possible to make it visible on icloud.com ? How ?
