MacBook Pro 2011 logging itself out after a period of inactivity <body> when I am not using it, at some point, every day, my MBP tries to log out on its own. When I 'wake it up' I can see message windows about "applications aborting logout", obviously because some applications that needed to save data aren't allowing OSX to close them.   This is extremely irritating, because all applications that have nothing to save, will close down on me, sometimes in the middle of a long download.   My MBP isn't configured for hibernation, or logging out, or even sleeping. It's always does it on AC power and I strongsimply have no idea why/strong.  The problem started with Snow Leopard, and persists with Lion as well.  Output of my pmset utility is:  precodeActive Profiles: Battery Power       -1 AC Power        -1* Currently in use:  standbydelay   4200  standby    0  womp       1  halfdim    1  panicrestart   157680000  hibernatefile  /var/vm/sleepimage  sms        1  networkoversleep   0  disksleep  10  sleep      0  hibernatemode  3  ttyskeepawake  1  displaysleep   60  acwake     0  lidwake    1 /code/pre  Does anyone have a clue why my mac tries to shut down all the applications and logout when I don't use it for a few hours? How do I stop this?  <answer22291> I believe I discovered the culprit. The "security" settings have a "Log out after "x" hours of inactivity". It was checked on my MBP, but disabled visually due to the settings being locked. This is probably why I wasn't paying attention to it.   Unchecking this option, and letting run overnight, it did not try to log out. Problem resolved.  <answer53129> System Preferences - Security and Privacy - Unlock the settings - click the Advanced button - Disable the logout option  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/O9lUb.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer53130> okay i have a much better solution for you. Go to mac appstore and download caffeine. It can keep your computer awake and more.  <comment24591> Have you tried creating a new user and seeing if the problem persists there? If the issue is in some obscure setting, it may be easier to delete your user preferences and start again than to try and debug this. <comment24600> Once upon a time, I wrote a Windows application that logs off my computer at a certain time. Then I forgot about it. It ran one night and I couldn't figure it out for the longest time. Perhaps you have something obscure like that in a cron or other scheduler, like a idle-timeout log-off? <comment24686> Excellent, can I be cheeky and ask you to edit the title of this question to something more descriptive so future users will be able to search more effectively?  Cheers,Dan <comment24703> I saw a similar question about this kind of issue here and the same fix was found. :) <comment60791> Presumably by "this setting" Taylor means the setting described in the answer by ron M. <comment201496> OMG you don't know how long I have tried to find out the cause of this!  I've googled multiple times in the past but never found this solution.  Thank you!!!! <comment234258> For those confused about where to find this setting (as I was)  Head to System Preferences  Security & Privacy  General  Advanced (Down the bottom!) and then un-tick the top option, or turn up the time allowed at idle.  Cheers for the answer Ron.
