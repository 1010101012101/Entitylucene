How can I get rid of a podcast? <body> I am desperately attempting to get rid of a podcast, but iTunes continues to resurrect it. The podcast I am trying to get rid of is the NBC Nightly News (Video).  These are the images of what it looks like when I am attempting to get rid of it:  ol liIn iTunes, it shows at unsubscribed./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uxXG6.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sV1lR.png" alt="enter image description here"  ol start="2" liIn the iTunes store it shows as unsubscribed./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lqaa2.png" alt="enter image description here"  So, I should be able to simply delete it from iTunes and it should be gone. Right? Well, I select the podcast and press the delete key. It presents this dialog:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aFSju.png" alt="enter image description here"  I select the delete option and it appears to be gone.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ENdXm.png" alt="enter image description here"  I then quit and restart iTunes and it comes right back again.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/F8lZq.png" alt="enter image description here"  If I recheck the iTunes store, it still shows as unsubscribed.   Why? Why? Why?  What do I need to do to rid myself of this podcast? Any ideas?
