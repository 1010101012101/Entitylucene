Is there an inverse command to open in the Terminal? <body> By using codeopen/code, I can open a file via terminal.  For example:   precode$ open ~/Documents/notes.pdf /code/pre  opens the file codenotes.pdf/code in the Documents folder of my home directory. It shows up as a window. Now I'm wondering:   Is there an opposite terminal command with which I can close the opened window (besides codekill &lt;pid&gt;/code)?  <answer247806> Use codeAppleScript/code via codeosascript/code  precode osascript -e 'quit app "Preview"'  /code/pre  <comment305791> Do you want to quit the application or just close the window and leave the application running? <comment305792> Actually quit the application. But if you know a of closing a window: That would interest me too. <comment305797> Awesome !! Works like charm. Thanks. <comment305802> Only works on apps that have coded for AppleScript.  (But that is almost everything from Apple and a good portion of the rest).
