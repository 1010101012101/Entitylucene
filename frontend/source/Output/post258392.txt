How to create a macOS Sierra iso installer successfully? <body> I want to test Sierra before fully installing it on my computer by creating a Sierra iso installer, which I can use on Virtual Box. When I attempt the first step below (mount the installer image) I get an error from hdutil that the resource is busy. Does anyone have suggestions on how to safely do this?     error: hdiutil: attach failed - Resource busy   steps:   ol liMount the installer image   precodehdiutil attach /Applications/Install\ macOS\ Sierra.app/Contents/SharedSupport/InstallESD.dmg -noverify - nobrowse -mountpoint /Volumes/install_app /code/pre/li liConvert the boot image to a sparse bundle  precodehdiutil convert /Volumes/install_app/BaseSystem.dmg -format UDSP -o /tmp/Sierra /code/pre/li liIncrease the sparse bundle capacity to accommodate the packages  precodehdiutil resize -size 8g /tmp/Sierra.sparseimage /code/pre/li liMount the sparse bundle for package addition  precodehdiutil attach /tmp/Sierra.sparseimage -noverify -nobrowse -mountpoint /Volumes/install_build /code/pre/li liRemove Package link and replace with actual files  precoderm /Volumes/install_build/System/Installation/Packages cp -rp /Volumes/install_app/Packages /Volumes/install_build/System/Installation/ /code/pre/li liUnmount the installer image  precodehdiutil detach /Volumes/install_app /code/pre/li /ol  Thanks for your time!  <comment322992> Have a look at my answer, http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/253640/install-sierra-as-guest-os-in-vm-with-parallels-12/253644?s=2|0.4333#253644 and make sure that the InstallESD.dmg and BaseSystem.dmg files are not mounted before running the script. <comment322994> Thanks for your quick response. I'm not sure how to check for that (first time making an ISO). When I ran your script I got this error:  `christinas-MacBook-Pro:shell_scripts christina$ ./makeSierraISO hdiutil: attach failed - Resource busy ............................................................................................................................. created: /Users/christina/shell_scripts/macOS_Sierra_10.12.0.cdr.dmg /dev/disk4           Apple_partition_scheme           ` <comment322996> `/dev/disk4s1         Apple_partition_map              /dev/disk4s2         Apple_HFS                       /Volumes/iso Validating target...done Could not recognize "/Volumes/esd/BaseSystem.dmg" as an image file Could not get source volume name rm: /Volumes/OS X Base System/System/Installation/Packages: No such file or directory cp: /Volumes/esd/Packages: No such file or directory cp: directory /Volumes/OS X Base System does not exist hdiutil: detach failed - No such file or directory ` <comment322998> Before you run the script InstallESD.dmg and BaseSystem.dmg cannot already be mounted. Open Disk Utility and if mounted eject them, then run the script. <comment323001> The script now runs, but the installer doesn't work in the iso. When I start virtual box, it returns a black screen. <comment323009> I no longer use VirtualBox as it never really supported OS X/macOS as good as VMware Fusion does, so I really can't offer any help with VB. The script I pointed you to creates a bootable installer image that works in VMware Fusion and Parallels Desktop, so theoretically it should also work in VirtualBox. That said, as bad as VirtualBox was at running OS X, I wouldn't waist my time with it even just to evaluate, I'd use VMware Fusion or Parallels Desktop. Even then, not all features are supported in a VM but you'd get a better evaluation then with VB. Both VMware & Parallels have free trials. <comment323034> success! "some people encountered black screen upon booting the virtual machine. They reported that changing the default chipset ICH9 to PIIX3 fixes this issue."  from this article: http://ntk.me/2012/09/07/os-x-on-os-x/
