How to index Evernote notes with LaunchBar? <body> I use both LaunchBar and Evernote, which are both great productivity tools.  I would like to have all my Evernote notes indexed by LaunchBar, so that I can access them by typing part of the note title and/or contents. For exemple, if I've got a codeTODO list/code note containing codeShopping/code, I should be able to see my note listed by LaunchBar at least by typing "TODO" and possibly even by typing "Shopping" (although this latter part might be best handled by Spotlight).  How can this be done?  <answer198708> I found this question and it made me go look for an answer! What I found is useful, though not directly addressing your question, it does provide the functionality.

That is very slick for me.   <comment269444> Does it really work for you? In my case, Evernote opens up with the search keyword in the search box, but results do not change at all. Even pressing Enter does nothing to help. I have to literally go to the search box and play with the query myself, in order to activate it
