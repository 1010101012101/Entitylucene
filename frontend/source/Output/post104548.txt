Can I disable auto-correction of a single word on OS X? <body> I'm running into an annoying issue with OS X's automatic spelling correction where the word codenala/code gets automatically corrected to codenapa/code.  I've tried adding codenala/code to my custom dictionary under code~/Library/Spelling/LocalDictionary/code but it still reliably makes the correction anyway.  How do I configure OS X to not automatically correct a given word short of turning off automatic correction entirely which is not really desirable?  <answer104555> Go to strongSystem Preferences/strong → strongLanguage &amp; Text/strong.  Choose the Text tab. There you can see all of the auto-correct words - just disable\delete codenala/code.  <answer104565> When typing the word, right-click it and choose strongSpelling &amp; Grammar/strong → strongShow Spelling and Grammar/strong. This will bring up a window similar to the one below. It should say that the word was not found in the spelling dictionary.  Click strongLearn/strong to teach the word to the current dictionary.                     img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/D1baF.png" width="465"  hr  The file code~/Library/Spelling/LocalDictionary/code only contains some of your corrections. This depends on which language you have currently selected. For example, my code~/Library/Spelling//code folder contains multiple custom dictionaries depending on the language that I have currently set. As well as codeLocalDictionary/code, I have files named codeen/code and codeen_GB/code. Editing these files instead of codeLocalDictionary/code can help set custom words when they refuse to be read from codeLocalDictionary/code.  precode~/Library/Spelling ├── LocalDictionary ├── dynamic-counts.dat ├── dynamic-text.dat ├── en └── en_GB  0 directories, 5 files /code/pre  <answer125028> Yes you can do it.    ol liGo to System Preferences  Keyboard  Text.  /li liClick the + sign on the bottom left to add a new text replacement./li liIn the Replace column, put the word you want OS X to stop autocorrecting (no spaces are allowed)./li liIn the With column, put the exact same word you put in the Replace column./li /ol  Voila.  You're done.  This has worked flawlessly for me every time.  <answer141323> If you hold the option key when you hit the space bar after typing the word autocorrect will not change the word.  <answer154970> Go to System Preferences  Keyboard . Go to text tab. Uncheck "Correct spelling automatically".  <answer155788> Right click on the word and choose strongLearn Spelling/strong.  <answer213963> Hitting kbdEsc/kbd seems to override the autocorrect for me. It has the same effect as hitting the codeX/code button on the suggested "correction."  It's not a permanent fix for a word you need to use consistently, but it should help avoid you adding hundreds of words to the dictionary or turning off autocorrect completely.  <answer228362> ol litap two fingers on the trackpad with the cursor on the word/li liit will pop up a dropdown list/li liuncheck the "check spelling" and "autocorrect spelling"  voila! your are done ...the England People will not trouble you anymore  the other options will be a tedious one to add all the craps one by one/li /ol  <comment123023> That list relates to symbol and text substitution which is a separate feature to auto-correction and so cannot be used to solve my problem <comment182315> The question says "short of turning off automatic correction entirely " <comment200634> Great answer. Unfortunately, this does not seem to prevent Mail (and probably other OS X Apps) from oh-so-helpfully changing "--" to "—". "--" is how you indicate a comment in Ada, so when I write sample Ada code in an e-mail, I find it very frustrating. <comment232913> This does not work for me. <comment232915> The only thing that works for me are one of these two annoying procedures:  (1) take my hand off the keyboard, move it to the mouse and position the cursor to the "X" and click; (2) backup and change the word back to the correct spelling. The program then seems to understand that it should not attempt to change the word. It  simply underlines it with the squiggly red underline. <comment274746> This does not work for me either. <comment274747> This does not work. Hitting escape closes the autocorrect recommendations bubble but when you press spacebar it replaces the word anyways. <comment278424> OP specifically says not this. <comment339106> I might get downvoted for saying so, but this is not the correct answer. This solution, though functional, is a hack. Looks like @grgarside's answer, posted 2 years later probably when the non-hack solution was available, is the correct answer now. <comment342918> Unfortunately, this does not work in Sierra.
