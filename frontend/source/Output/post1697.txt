Silence calls from everyone but a defined set of numbers? <body> If I'm on-call, I only want to be woken by important calls or text messages.  How can I set up an iPhone to ring during certain hours strongonly/strong for calls or texts from a certain set of numbers?  If it can't be done using vanilla iPhone apps, is there a 3rd party app that could do it?  <answer1698> You could make a silent ringtone your default, and then assign other custom ringtones to each of that certain set of numbers.  See Apple's Purchasing and creating ringtones FAQ for a start.  <answer1699> If you jailbreak, of course there's an app for that, several in fact. Search for "blacklist".  <answer266087> strong2016/strongbr This has changed significantly recently - posting this with iOS 10, but I think was available from 9, maybe 8  Settings  Do Not Disturb  You can set a defined daily schedulebr This can also be toggled from the lockscreen, on an ad-hoc basis  Settings  Do Not Disturb  Allow Calls From    You can choose by many criteria, Everyone, No-One, Favourites... or any specific group from Contacts  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/O13aG.png" width="250"   <comment1492> I thought about doing this as an interim solution, though remembering to change it back when I _can_ be disturbed is not something I do reliably :/
