Move programs and games to external storage <body> I want to move some programs, games form MacBook Pro SSD to the external HDD. With Xcode it was no problem. Cause Xcode was under Application and I could copy it and create link to it.  But I have some games that are not asking about installation path. And that are installed on many different places on my SSD. For example under user-documents etc.  If I move it simply to an external drive - it doesn't work. I think they have some internal references, maybe under config files, to each part.   Are there any solutions to move the programs and games that are not stored under Application?  I want to move - GarageBand (with all additional sounds etc.), WarThunder and World of Warships from internal to external drive.  <answer271827> In general, I know it's recommended that SSD be used for applications and system, and an external drive be used for storage - documents, images, movies, music, etc.  Is the reason you want to move these particular apps, especially GarageBand, because you rarely use these and they are taking up precious space on your SSD?  If that's the case, I'd recommend completely deleting GarageBand. You can always download it again, should you ever want to play around with it. Not familiar with the other games, sorry.  If that's not the case, then the simplest (but most time-consuming solution) might be to do a clean install of these apps on your external drive. This way the install software will have all the file paths set up correctly, and they should work right from the start.  <comment341671> How can I tell GarageBand to be installed on external drive?
