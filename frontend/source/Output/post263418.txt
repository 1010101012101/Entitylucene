Can you turn off the (the lighting) of the Touch Bar on the new MacBook Pros? <body> So I don't have a the new MacBook Pro here, but can you actually turn the TouchBar off, like you can turn off the backlit keyboard, when you're watching movie in example?  On a little research couldn't find any information about that.  <answer263439> You can't actually turn it off manually but it will automatically after 75 seconds of inactivity (Trackpad or Keyboard). It could be nice to turn it off manually or at least change the duration. I hope it will be implemented in the future.   <answer281570> You can turn off the Touch Bar with this open source utility, Touch Bar Disabler. It disables the Touch Bar display, while mapping brightness controls onto Ctrl + 0, Ctrl + 1, volume controls onto Ctrl + 8, Ctrl + 9, Ctrl + 0.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WNUFR.jpg" alt="Touch Bar Disabler&#39;s screenshot"  <comment330052> Considering you have just recently joined and therefore haven't yet gain any appreciable reputation, maybe if you add an authoritative reference to your answer it might get some up-votes.

So how is he supposed to link to something that does not exist? <comment354557> @DisplayName I think he is asking for a source about the 45 seconds <comment354605> So it's completely dark? <comment354611> Yes!
