Gaming - MBP runs too hot <body> When I play Diablo 3 on my MBP (late 2011) the computer gets unbelievably hot.   It gets to be too hot to touch near where the screen connects to the keyboard.   I get the feeling like this is terrible for the computer.   I put an external cooling pad underneath it, but it doesn't really help that much.  I also have an app called "IStat Menus by Bjango" which controls the fans.   I stopped using the software a while ago, but it is an option and it is legitimate.  Is there any way I can help it cool down, or should I just buy a computer specific for gaming?  I found a real good ARTICLE on the subject.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MvcHU.png" alt="Specs on my mac"  <answer232495> As per Intel's site, the maximum temperature for this CPU is 100 C.  I wouldn't be immediately concerned unless your machine is freezing / shutting down, or showing video artifacts.  Obviously 80 C is still pretty warm; you can try some things to bring it down.  ul liActive cooling pad/base with fans built in/li liCleaning out the CPU fan and exhaust vents.  This requires taking off the bottom cover./li liUsing iStats or another program to run the fan at a higher speed./li /ul  <comment284094> What is 'hot' in degrees? <comment284095> @CousinCocaine 80-90 C w/ a cooling pad underneath <comment284096> Measured on the chip? If so, these are no abnormal temperatures. <comment284097> yeah, measured from the cpu <comment284098> MBP's are known to run hot. Some say it is due to too much cool paste. I just bought a Playstation for gaming, solved it for me. <comment284099> haha, you think I should stop using it or does it matter? Maybe just point some external fans at it? <comment284101> You didn't specify exactly the type of processor but you can easily look up the max operating temperature for your CPU. <comment284102> @Hefewe1zen I added an image of the system specs <comment284110> I don't recommend using a third party app to control your fans. It's not needed. <comment284130> Do you think IStat is safe to use? <comment284131> @PeterCampanelli that's what I was thinking too <comment284133> These temps are fine. Modern CPU's slow down automatically when becoming too hot. <comment284134> iStat is reliable software
