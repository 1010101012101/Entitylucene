How to upgrade but to save existing data somewhere on the hard drive? Thank you  <answer65316> You should be able to upgrade without loosing any data, as long as you do strongnot/strong opt to have the HD erased or formatted prior to installing the OS, during the installation process.  <comment76823> Are you sure? I thought this is true only for one level upgrade... <comment77346> 10.7 officially allows for direct upgrade down to 10.5.8.
