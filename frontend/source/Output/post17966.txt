How can I set a different scrolling direction for mouse and trackpad in Lion? <body> I want to give the new scrolling behavior in Lion a try (both on the built-in as well as on the magic trackpad).  But on my Mouse (a Logitech Anywhere MX), I don't want reverse scrolling. In preferences, it seems as if there were two different settings (one in the mouse prefPane, the other in the trackpad prefPane), however changing one always changes the other.  Is it possible to set this behavior independently?  <answer18022> h2No/h2  Currently in Lion the preference for reverse scrolling sets the direction for both mice and trackpads.  If you want to switch directions quickly you might look into strongScrollreverser/strong which puts the option in the menubar.  <answer65133> Scrollreverser (free app) actually supports configuring the scrolling direction for each kind of device separately.  <answer214795> Another (paid) option is SteerMouse. Years ago I bought SteerMouse and haven't had any problems with it. It has worked perfectly for me on Mavericks, Yosemite, El Capitan, and now Sierra.  Sierra Update: Version 5 of SteerMouse is needed for Sierra support, but it is working fine. (From what I have read here, ScrollReverser is having some issues with Sierra.)  <answer260272> Posting this as a separate answer based on a recommendation.  As of version 1.9.3 BetterTouchTool now supports inversing the scroll direction only for normal mice. It works with Sierra. BetterTouchTool is not free but it is very reasonably priced.  I have noticed the scroll sensitivity is not what I expect when I use BetterTouchTool to reverse mouse scroll direction, so I personally prefer SteerMouse (mentioned in my other answer to this question). To be more specific, for some reason with Better Touch Tool mouse scrolling I have to scroll more than a few "clicks" for it to recognize that I have started scrolling, which means I can't easily scroll a small amount.  <comment139782> Free but closed-source. <comment140511> https://github.com/pilotmoon/Scroll-Reverser <comment174071> Scrollreverser is awesome. <comment230111> I hope that someone like Logitech will come up with a mouse with switchable scroll wheel direction - even underneath the mouse, I would use it only once and then forget about it!!! <comment284923> It has too many preferences to set up â€“ for my tastes. <comment325655> Yes, SteerMouse has a lot of preferences, but I only set two settings - scroll direction for mouse wheel up, and scroll direction for mouse wheel down. That's all that is needed. <comment325658> In my opinion, your [revision about Better Touch Tool](http://apple.stackexchange.com/revisions/214795/3) should be a seperate answer to this question. <comment325787> @Peanut moved it to a separate answer
