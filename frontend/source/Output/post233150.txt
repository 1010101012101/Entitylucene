Apple store apps won't download but have a iCloud symbol <body> I have downloaded the app before and then deleted by accedent but now it won't download at all and has a little cloud symbol instead of an install symbol  <answer233260> These might look obvious but it's always best to check:  ol liMake sure you're connected to the internet and that you have a good, strong signal./li liDo you have enough space available on your device?  You didn't mention the device or space used but if you don't have enough space available for the app, it won't download./li liDo other apps download?  Try downloading a free app.  This makes sure your network settings are not messed up./li liReboot your device and try again./li liReset your Network settings to the defaults.  Go to codeSettings --&gt; General --&gt; Reset --&gt; Reset Network Settings/code.  You'll lose the login user id &amp; password from every network you've been on, so be prepared with that info in order to log in to your wifi networks./li liIf all those fail, it's time to contact Apple./li /ol  <answer238939> Try to clear up the memory, at least 1 GB. Then, try to download.   <answer252049> I know my answer might be late for you, but maybe it can help somebody else. I had the SAME frustrating problem with the GOOGLE CHROME APP and I solved it this way:  ol liGo to Settings -- Storage &amp; iCloud Usage/li liGo to the section that says ICLOUD/li liClick on Manage Storage/li liClick on Joana's (Your name) iPhone/li liAt the Backup Options turn off Chrome/li liGo to the App Store and try to download the app again. Hopefully, it will start downloading! For me this solved the problem./li /ol  <answer257042> Choose any new app and try to install that. And as that install is going on, hit the cloud download on the app that was frozen/stuck. With any luck the frozen app will start downloading too. This is how it got sorted on my side today. Hope it helps.   <answer267199> If you have time warner cable/spectrum or a new router or internet, you must login and make sure your device is trusted. I did this and it fixed everything.   <answer274242> i had the same prob for watsapp app try checking ur apple id it must be on verfication try siging out nd signing inn ur apple id and then download. also check your i cloud back ups   <answer275613> I switched off the iCloud Drive and reinstalled from the Applestore the app which was still showing the cloud icon. It worked because it showed the latest update instead of the old one which had not changed when the app opened.  <comment284997> What happens if you tap on the cloud symbol? <comment344809> Welcome to Ask Different and thank you for your answer.
