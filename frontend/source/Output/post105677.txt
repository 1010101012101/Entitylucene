Positioning desktop icons on the left instead of right <body> Any way to automatically make alias or icons to show up on the left side of apple desktop. By default they go to the right.  <answer105688> There is no way to force icons to go to the left automatically (and stay arranged by the criterion you choose).  As a workaround, you can change the strongView Options/strong in Finder to not arrange items by any criterion and place icons manually on the left.  ul liClick on an empty space on the desktop./li liPress kbdCmd/kbd+kbdJ/kbd or use the mouse to go to the Finder's strongView  Show View Options/strong menu./li liIn the strongSort by:/strong dropdown in the dialog, choose either strongNone/strong or strongSnap to Grid/strong./li liYou'll be able to drop files anywhere on your desktop and they'll stay there./li /ul  See Mac Basics: Modify your windows for more information.  strongAlso go through the Mac Basics pages to learn more about using a Mac./strong  <answer264749> Organize all the folders in the order you want them. Then under View hit 'clean up.' This will align everything nicely. Then you can simply highlight all of the folders and position them exactly where you want them. Macs don't organize folders on the left, only the right, but with a couple of easy steps you can have everything neatly organized on the left.   <comment124269> Q is asking about the automatic Clean Up By and Sort By choices, I believe, in the Finder View menu--and that would be kind of cool. Why only arrange to the right? <comment124314> Thanks. I missed the automatic part and have corrected the answer. <comment155504> [You will probably need to use AppleScript](http://books.google.com/books?id=KQ4Y9h6inCQC&pg=PA636&lpg=PA636&dq=mac+desktop+icons+on+left+%22inferior%22&source=bl&ots=vNmIA_wMlE&sig=lAQ3VeoOX7iJ1gkp90pRyqR7jF8&hl=en&sa=X&ei=gFeHU5rkDoueyATU2oCIBA&ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA) <comment331888> This should read 'view' instead of 'window' sorry, that was my bad. <comment331950> There is an edit link below the answer which allows to edit the text directly :-)
