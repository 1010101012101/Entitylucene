Where does the name come from on Mail.app? <body> I tried to use OS X's codeMail.app/code, but when I connected it using gmail, the authentication window showed my real name in Chinese character in the first text field. The other two fields are mail and password, so I didn't log in to my gmail account yet. However, it looks like the codeMail.app/code already knows my real name, and I wonder where it gets the information from.  My Apple account and iCloud account use my real name in English. So I want to check out where my Chinese character name was found and then fix it and change it to English.  <answer146370> This is pulled from your 'me' contact in Contacts.app.  <comment172474> Thanks. I didn't remember there is `me` contact in the `Contacts.app` and my email there was the one that was deleted 3 years ago...
