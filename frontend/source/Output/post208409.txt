Will Mac Mini work with Dell Inspiron Laptop <body> I am interested in buying the new Mac Mini as I cannot afford a Mac book or Air. The laptop I have is Dell Inspiron 3537. So I wanted to know is it possible to connect Mac Mini with my Dell laptop. Any help will be appreciated.  <answer241804> h1VNC/h1  You can use VNC on your Mac to show the screen on your Windows or Linux laptop:     strongVNC is an abbreviation of Virtual Network Computing/strong. VNC is a common protocol that allows computers to both share and to offer control over the network. Using VNC you can connect to and see your computer remotely; great for remote working or helping a relative perform tricky tasks without needing to be in the same location.      strongMac OS X includes a built-in free VNC server/strong. You can set up and use VNC on your Mac without needing additional or third party software.   There are numerous Windows and Linux VNC clients you can use on your Dell laptop.

You can add them to the same Network, but little else. <comment251420> The thing is I need to do some development work on Yosemite. And since I cannot afford Mac Book, I was suggested that I should go for Mac Mini which you can connect to any laptop(in my case Dell 3537) and you can then use it as a Mac Book.I hope this makes sense. Sorry,I am new to Apple products that's why I asked this question. <comment251423> You could use VNC to connect to it from your Dell laptop, but you will have to connect a keyboard, mouse and monitor to it to set that up initially.
