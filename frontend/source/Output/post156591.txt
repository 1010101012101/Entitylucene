Move files using shortcut keys in Forklift for Mac <body> Does anyone know here how to move files using just shortcut keys in Forklift for Mac? I just don't like to click File  Move to, to move files/folders from one tab to another. I think there's a short cut key or I think I can set a shortcut key, but I just don't know how to do it in Forklift. It's not even in their FAQs and I cannot find any post online regarding Forklift shortcut keys.  I just want to select files and copy/move from one tab to another fast, without pointing my mouse to the move to link under File in the top menu.  I hope somebody here is familiar with Forklift and would share some tips of how to move files fast from one tab to another. :D  <answer156596> You can use  ul likbdTab/kbd to switch between left and right pane/li liCursor keys to move up and down within a pane/li likbdCmd-C/kbd/kbdCmd-V/kbd to copy/paste files and folders/li /ul  <answer156598> You can set a keyboard shortcut for the Move To command in the Forklift preferences. I tested using Command-Shift-M, which is unused in the default Forklift shortcuts. With that configured, any files/folders selected in the active browsing pane will be moved to the location in the other browsing pane.  <comment185089> Thanks but it didn't move any files. It just copied it from one pane to another. Haha :D <comment185090> That actually worked! Thanks douggro! Weeee! :D
