Why did Apple assign the wrong name to my AppleID, and how do I change it? <body> I'm setting up an iPad for Mom's birthday. In the process, I created her an AppleID, and typed in her name. Signing into iCloud using her ID shows my name instead.  How do I fix this?   <answer236660> If the name on the Apple ID or the billing address is incorrect, you can fix it at https://appleid.apple.com  You can edit the name on the account here... img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ErKsE.png" alt="Edit Account"  And you can edit the billing name here... img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QaM14.png" alt="Edit Payment"  (Look for the strongEdit/strong buttons.)  <comment289618> If you properly followed [Create and start using an Apple ID](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203993), using only information pertaining to her, and not you in any way, there shouldn't be an issue. I'd contact Apple directly to resolve it. <comment289633> I've had this issue as well, though the cause may be different. The card that I charge to doesn't have the same name as my Apple ID–sometimes it decides to use that as my name instead of the one I tied to my Apple ID. <comment289634> It could also be something different,go to https://appleid.apple.com and see if everything is good. <comment289787> Thank you, JMY1000. I did indeed put my card info for the time being. Is it safe to assume, then, that when I switch it to her card the name will change? Also, supposing it hadn't been that, how would you go about changing the name? <comment289788> Neither of those is what I'm trying to change, but thanks. <comment350309> I think they are. I’ve clarified the answer.
