Is the Verizon iPhone 4 susceptible to the 'grip of death'? <body> Of course, it's possible to get any phone to lose a bit of signal if you cover the antenna with your hands, but I'm wondering if the Verizon iPhone 4 also suffers from the attenuation issues that the AT&amp;T iPhone 4 famously suffered from last summer:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mEILj.jpg" alt=""  <answer6244> ArsTechnica notes that there is no  noticeable signal loss when gripping it with the 'death grip'. Though due to the way smart phone antennas are designed, it still may be possible  <answer6247> The flaw is in the iPhone 4's antenna design, not the network or carrier.  So, I would say yes.  The software "fix" they released is supposed to make the bars depict signal quality more accurately, so you may find that while on Verizon, "the death grip" doesn't affect signal quality at all or as much.. but that doesn't negate that the antenna design itself is flawed physically, and that's why "the death grip" has any affect on signal quality.  <answer6252> As an add-on to the Ars report: photos of the adjustment of button locations also show differing locations of the breaks in the metal band around the device, so it's quite possible there was a real hardware change.    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4e1UP.jpg" alt="Verizon vs AT&amp;T iPhone buttons"  Other pictures show different breaks near the bottom of the phone, too.  <answer6264> Slashgear confirms that the Verizon iPhone 4 does not suffer from the death grip:     We put our hand in the standard “death   grip” location, making sure that we   covered up all of the right spots, and   held onto the device for up to a   minute. When we started the test, the   device was at four bars. It should be   noted that full service is represented   on the iPhone 4 with 5 bars. So, the   test started with only four bars being   shown. As we held the device, and we   timed it at a minute, we watched as   only one bar disappeared.      We then put our fingers over certain   points on the device. Making sure to   cover up the “new” top portion of the   antenna, and we still couldn’t   reproduce the “death grip” symptoms   that plagued the initial launch of the   iPhone 4. You can check out the images   from our test below, but it looks like   Verizon’s confidence in the iPhone 4   on their network seem to be pretty   sound.   <comment6545> Andy Ihnatko of the Chicago Suntimes noted that there was no official response when asked about an antenna redesign.  Glad to see that ArsTechnica tested it out :) <comment6560> To be fair, iPhone users the world over have not seen this issue in any consistently replicable fashion. The only documented pattern seen at large by users has been centric to AT&T customers. <comment6577> it had to be a hardware change because of the different radios. But I am sure they took the time to work on it to make it better than before. <comment6580> @jmlumpkin Yeah, certainly. I meant a hardware change beyond replacing the radio chip, some other physical changes. <comment6594> @David Interesting!  I never thought it was a big deal anyway.
