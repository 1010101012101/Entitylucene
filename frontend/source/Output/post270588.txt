MDM 'forgets' pushed calendar/contacts passwords <body> We deployed in our office MDM on a Mac Mini and configured VPN, Calendar and Contacts for about 10 people in our office. We also have one company calendar and contacts account which was deployed for a user group for every user. Everything was working for about a week or 10 days and then it started that some users were asked to enter the password for the company wide address book and calendar on their iPhones or Mac's.   I couldn't find anything on the internet about such a problem, logs look fine and no new settings were pushed to the user group in between.  Any ideas where to look or how to debug this?
