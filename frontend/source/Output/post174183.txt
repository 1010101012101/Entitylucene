Merge two word documents into one document <body> Is there a way to combine two versions of the same Word for Mac 2011 into one document?   I have multiple revisions with comments from co-authors and would like to combine the documents with comments into one document.   Note: I am not interested in the insert file method that is used to insert a document into another document, essentially combing two documents into 1. I want to "merge" two versions into 1 version.   <answer174188> Have you tried to use the built in merge tool?  However, I don't know whether it goes beyond simple documents.  <answer174190> From: Compare and merge two versions of a document  You can also merge two versions of the same document into one new document. In both cases, Word shows the differences with revision marks.  NOTE   You cannot merge two separate documents into one.  strongMerge two versions of a document/strong  ol liOpen one of the two versions of the document that you want to merge./li liOn the strongTools/strong menu, click strongMerge Documents/strong./li liOn the strongOriginal document/strong pop-up menu, select one version of the document./li liOn the strongRevised document/strong pop-up menu, browse to the other version of the document, and then click strongOK/strong./li /ol  <comment205104> Thanks. I saw this but was looking in the wrong place and assumed the write up was for windows word. It's not on the review tab / section, but under tools in the MENU BAR..
