How do I use my existing KeePass database on my new iPad without iTunes on a computer? <body> I'm a Linux user who bought an iPad. I'm also an Infosec pro who uses the KeePassX password manager. All my passwords are too long to type on the iPad - so I want to use my password manager on iPad. I installed MiniKeePass on the iPad - and with some difficulty (had to type in the password for one service), moved the database (.kdbx) to iPad. I used the export/share functionality to make the kdbx to make it available to MiniKeePass app.  I'm stuck here. I need to move my Key File too.   I can't find any way to get the Key File into MiniKeePass. The standard export/share functions don't seem to work for plain text files without extensions.   All the advice I got so far is "Use iTunes". I'm a Linux user; no Windows / Mac or even Wine.   Any suggestions?  <comment363913> Have you contacted KeePass support to ask them how to do what you want? <comment363915> Ah, an OpenSource enthusiast mistake. I (probably wrongly) assumed the only support would be community support. I'll check. Thanks for pointing it out. <comment364090> I opened an issue on their repo https://github.com/MiniKeePass/MiniKeePass/issues/493 - waiting for response. [edit: Apparently this is the normal method to ask for and get support.] <comment364479> @fsb I'm holding out with some hope in this pull request - still under testing - https://github.com/MiniKeePass/MiniKeePass/pull/389 It seems to reflect some of my predicament. <comment364809> Looks like I need to wait longer for this to be resolved. I'll post an update when there's any progress. <comment373412> You could try with an "iOS File Explorer" like Documents5 (https://readdle.com/products/documents). Store temporally the Key File there (you can transfer the key file using the built-in http transfer system). Once you have the key file on the app try to transfer to MiniKeePass app using the share menu.
