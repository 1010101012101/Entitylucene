How to convert Windows-based ISO for Mac OS X Installation DVD? <body> I made an ISO image from Mac OS X Snow Leopard Installation DVD using PowerISO on Windows machine. The ISO file size is 7.6GB, but when I mount the ISO using PowerISO, what I can see is only the files for Windows (900+MB). How can I convert it back to Mac format ISO?  <answer75969> That's pretty normal to see only the files for windows, when you are mounting the ISO image on a windows!  Even if you have inserted a MAC OS Installation DVD (physical) into tray and openned it in a windows machine, you would have seen only the Windows files and not the MAC files.  <answer85282> Have you tried looking at the contents of the DVD from the cmd prompt under Windows?  I suspect the explorer is hiding the Mac contents.     In the same vein, put the DVD in a Mac and examine it there for the Mac files.
