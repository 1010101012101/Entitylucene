Automator can't find Symbolic Links? <body> I'm trying to create an automator workflow that starts out by finding all symbolic links in a given directory.  What's happening however is that even if I set it to return "all files", I end up with every single file emexcept/em symbolic links.  Automator seems to be unable to see them at all.  Is there a way to get Automator to return symlinks (not aliases)?  <answer139733> I'm unable to reproduce this. Automator seems to returns all files/folders, whether they are symlinks or not.  ol liI set up the following:  precode$ mkcd testfolder $ mkdir originalfolder $ ln -s originalfolder symlinkoforiginal $ ls total 24 drwxr-xr-x   5 grgarside  staff   170B 23 Jul 20:04 ./ drwx------@ 11 grgarside  staff   374B 23 Jul 20:04 ../ -rw-r--r--@  1 grgarside  staff   6.0K 23 Jul 20:04 .DS_Store drwxr-xr-x   2 grgarside  staff    68B 23 Jul 20:04 originalfolder/ lrwxr-xr-x   1 grgarside  staff    50B 23 Jul 20:04 symlinkoforiginal -&gt; /Users/grgarside/Desktop/testfolder/originalfolder /code/pre/li liI ran the following Automator workflow:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oNXKO.png" width="530"/li /ol  As shown in the results, both the folder and the symlink were returned.  <comment164688> Interesting... yes your solution does return all files, but what I was doing was using Find Finder Items to attempt to specify symlinks only, and that's what doesn't see them at all.  I may be able to work with this but do you have any idea why Find Finder Items cannot see symlinks? <comment164689> @Jonathan Ah, I presume Find Finder Items uses Spotlight `mdfind` which doesn't see symlinks either. <comment164691> Aha, that would make sense.  It seems that Filter Finder Items does too, in which case how on earth can I select *only* symlinks? <comment164692> @Jonathan I don't think that's possible without doing some shell scripting (or using a custom action if one exists). <comment164693> Drat... I do have a command line that will get me what I want, will look into executing it within automator.  Thanks...
