Mac not seeing bootable drive <body> I'm trying to dual-boot Windows 7 onto my Macbook Pro. I was able to create a bootable drive by borrowing the use of a friend's Windows computer and using this software: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/windows-usb-dvd-download-tool#installation  However, after going through the process and supposedly copying the Iso onto the USB to make it into a bootable drive, my Mac still won't recognize it as anything other than a stick with some files on it.  I followed all the steps, using a legal Windows 7 Iso that I'd downloaded from Microsoft directly. I'm using a 32gb memory stick. I partitioned 100gb of space on my macbook so that there would be somewhere to install. I've rebooted while holding the option key, I've looked under system preferences and tried to change the boot drive, I've tried all kinds of creative vulgarity, but nothing is working and I've been trying to do this for over a month now. It's starting to get really, really frustrating.   What am I doing wrong?  (Oh, and to be clear: I can't use Bootcamp. Despite what I was told when I bought the Macbook, it won't allow me to partition Windows 7 despite the fact that the laptop is compatible.)
