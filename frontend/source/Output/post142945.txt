How to get full screen button in other applications on OS X? <body> I want the full screen button in image 2 to appear in the app shown in image 1 (Photoshop). In Chrome there's an option to go full screen, but in Photoshop and Office this does not exist. Is there any way to get it?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wKKQ9.png" alt="Image 1"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/w7Eyg.png" alt="Image 2"  <answer142949> Full screen support requires the developer to integrate it in to the app. You can't just 'add' the button to an app.
