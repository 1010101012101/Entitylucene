OS volume shows as type 'FFFFFFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFFFFFF' after attempting to delete some Linux partitions—cannot log in <body> I was unable to just delete the partitions left by an old Linux Mint installation by pressing the '-' button in disk utility. I looked online and read that I could reformat them to a journaled format from the command line and then delete it from disk utility. The command was something like codediskutil eraseVolume deleteme JFS+ /dev/disk0s4/code (and then again for disk0s5, as there were two).  After this command, disk utility showed the two partitions had been reformatted, but I could now see the Recovery HD partition between the two deleteme partitions and the Macintosh HD partition, which meant I could not delete them without deleting the Recovery HD partition, which even I knew was a bad idea.  I checked codediskutil list/code and saw that my main partition was now showing the type 'FFFFFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFFFFFF', so I was pretty sure something had gone wrong. I backed up my home folder and rebooted to be successfully brought to the login screen, but when I try to log in, it loads for a while before showing me a black screen with a grey no-symbol.  Here are the results of codediskutil list/code and codegpt -r show /dev/disk0/code:   img src="https://i.imgur.com/ooPXGv1.jpg" alt="image"  For the record I have a 13" Retina MacBook Pro mid-2014 version.  <answer238088> To correct the GUID error in your GPT, you need to start up from OS X Recovery over the Internet. Press and hold the kbdcommand(⌘)/kbdkbdoption/kbdkbdR/kbd keys immediately after you turn on your Mac and hear the startup sound. For more information see the site: OS X: About OS X Recovery. Once started to OS X Recovery, select the Terminal application from the menu bar. Enter the following commands to repair your GPT.  precodediskutil  unmountdisk  /dev/disk0 gpt  remove  -i  2  /dev/disk0 diskutil  unmountdisk  /dev/disk0 gpt  add  -i  2  -b  409640  -s  194016208  -t  hfs  /dev/disk0 /code/pre     Note: I do not know if this will fix your log in problems.   <comment291770> Before I post an answer, I would need the output from the command `fdisk  /dev/disk0`. Also, I assume you can boot your computer via internet recovery. I ask this because the `gpt` command can not be used to fix your computer when boot to your `Recovery HD`. <comment291787> @DavidAnderson Certainly! [Here](http://i.imgur.com/SHXCWAs.jpg) are the results of `fdisk`. And yes, internet recovery does indeed work.
