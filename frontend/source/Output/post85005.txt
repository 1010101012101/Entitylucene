Hotmail synced contact incoming name do not appear <body> I just bought an iPhone 4S and successfully managed to synchronize it with my Hotmail account, all in terms of mail, calendar and contacts.  However, although my contacts are visible and accessible in the contacts folder and I'm able to make calls to my contacts without problem, when any of my contacts calls me only the number appears and neither name, surname or any other details of that respective contact appears.  So I'm having problem of actually identifying the caller.  Any idea how to resolve this?  PS. I recently switched from my Samsung Omnia7 Windows Phone with which I used to have a perfect contact synchronization via Hotmail account. So I also didn't import any contacts from my SIM card as I don't have any there.  <comment97887> Which version of IOS are you running on your iPhone?  See *Settings* - *General* - *Informations*
