Locating AppleCare UK's New Live Online Chat Support? <body> Apparently AppleCare UK has been revamped to include a brand new live online chat support system, where you can chat in a text box with a member of technical support.  How do I locate this ?  <answer100250> Apple's UK Support page now has a strongGet Started/strong button which will start a emselection/em process to narrow down the required support's area.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/c3vQT.png" width="485"  After a couple of steps (choosing the product and topic) you'll be prompted to choose between different support options, among which you'll find the strongChat/strong button will be visible when there are people on staff to answer questions in near real time.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jquck.png" alt="Contact Apple Support UK"  <comment117976> Fabulous very useful <comment118016> Live support has been around for years in the US. Perhaps it's being rolled out in more countries? <comment118036> @bmike Ah... its only just being rolled out in the UK, I shall edit appropriately <comment118038> I have altered the question to be specific to the UK (as its been a feature of the US support for a number of years now), if that affects your answer at all.
