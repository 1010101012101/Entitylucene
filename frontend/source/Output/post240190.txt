How to get rid of default font (Helvetica Neue) in Numbers? <body> I am using Numbers '09. I defined (and saved within codeMy Templates/code) a template of a very basic table format where all cells are formatted with Palatino:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DnEoS.png" alt="My_Templates"  If I simply hit kbd⌘/kbd+kbdX/kbdwithin any selected cell, immediatly the font of the cell is switched to Helvetica Neue:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QOLz8.png" alt="My_Templates after ⌘+X"  This magic font switching also occurs on some other operations (example: move of a block of cells). This is leaving cells with the wrong format. When I discover this format corruption I have to manually set the font back to the one I configured in My Templates.  What could I have done wrong with my template? How may I avoid this behaviour?  <answer240194> You need to update the table style so that your changes persist for new cells. Make the changes to the formatting of the table as you wish, then select the dropdown triangle for the currently selected table style and choose strongRedefine Style from Table/strong (Numbers '09).                               img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Xd7nA.png" width="400"  hr  In more recent versions of Numbers, simply click the blue strongUpdate/strong button for the Table Style. The asterisk indicates changes have been made to the currently selected cell which has not been saved to the style.                                           img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pg9qu.png" width="279"  <comment295318> Clear, applied and fixed. Thank you. I suggest you to add at the end of the 1st scenaio (the one which worked for me): •• return •• Then save this as template with `File  Save as Template...` to fix your original template which contained a wrong table style.
