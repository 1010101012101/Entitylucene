How to use Cisco AnyConnect with certificates on OS X? <body> I installed ocserv on my VPS, and has been tested on my iPhone that it works. When I turned to OS X, the client could not connect to the server though. It said "No valid certificates available for authentication."  From the pop-up boxes, I noticed that the client was reading Apple ID Authentication instead of my client certificate. What should I do to force the client to use the correct one?  Client version: Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client for Mac (4.1.06013)
