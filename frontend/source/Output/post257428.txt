Keys seem to be stiff after spilling juice on keyboard <body> A few weeks ago I spilled juice on the keyboard of my MacBook Air 2013. Fortunately, I knew what to do and no problems since. However, lately, the keys on the right side of the keyboard are stiff which I presume is related to the juice spilling accident. The spacebar key seems to be especially stiff. I would like to know what to do here on out and if it is caused by the juice spilling accident what should I do?   <comment321425> Possible duplicate of [Macbook Air's keyboard malfunction after spill.
