Git mergetool/difftool not opening any custom tool <body> I'm trying to load a difftool (in this case, codevimdiff/code) to see file differences in Git. However, it won't load, even if I attempt to force it with codegit difftool -y -t vimdiff/code. No matter what, I can't seem to get it to respect the tool I'm trying to use and it just outputs to the console. How can I get Git to respect my diff or merge tool requests?
