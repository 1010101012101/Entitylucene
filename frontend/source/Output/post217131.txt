Safe to change permissions/ACLs for `~/.ssh/known_hosts`? <body> My initial problem: I am using codegit/code with SSH for authentication. Each time I push/pull, I get codeThe authenticity of the host […] can’t be established/code, and after confirming to trust the host, I can connect successfully, but the confirmation is not recorded: codeFailed to add the host to the list of known hosts (/Users/peterlefanulumsdaine/.ssh/known_hosts)./code  The cause appears to be restrictive permissions/access control lists (ACLs) of the file code~/.ssh/known_hosts/code, as described e.g. here.  precodepeterlefanulumsdaine$ ls -le ~/.ssh/ […] -rw-r--r--@ 1 peterlefanulumsdaine  staff  6795 18 Feb  2015 known_hosts 0: group:everyone deny write,delete,append,writeattr,writeextattr,chown /code/pre  and the obvious solution, as suggested at that link, is to clear the ACLs with codesudo chmod -N ~/.ssh/known_hosts/code.  However, I am wary of changing permissions without knowing something about the reasons for the existing settings.  So: strongwhy are the default permissions/ACLs for code~/.ssh/known_hosts/code restrictive, and is it safe to make them less restrictive by clearing the ACLs?/strong  (I am on Yosemite, 10.10.5.  I haven’t ever tinkered with code~/.ssh/known_hosts/code by hand.  The only tools I directly use that I would guess might have affected it are codessh/code, codegit/code, and codebrew/code.)  <answer217134> It's perfectly safe. The unix permissions you have set there are enough. I don't have an ACL on my known_hosts file.
