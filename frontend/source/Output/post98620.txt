Eclipse quit unexpectedly <body> I have a iMac 27 inch which I bought months ago. Whenever I try to open eclipse on the iMac it comes with a message that says:     Eclipse quit unexpectedly. Click Reopen to open the application again. Click Report to see more detailed information and send a report to Apple.   Is there a problem with my iMac or Eclipse? What should I do?  strongNOTE:/strong All other programs are working correctly  <comment115808> See [this](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/64105/eclipse-quit-unexpectedly-mac-os-x-10-7-4-and-eclipse-3-8). Basically, the article I linked above says that you should make sure you extract the `tar gz` file correctly (maybe your download was corrupted or the application you used to extract Eclipse was corrupted) and drag the entire folder to Applications. Then, the icon should appear in your Launchpad and you should be able to open it. <comment115815> We could take this question in two directions. 1) If you really have no idea on how to narrow down the specific Eclipse issue - we can field general troubleshooting procedures. If you want to be more precise and focus on getting Eclipse running on your particular Mac - we'll need you to edit in the exact version of Eclipse you installed, the exact version of OS X and perhaps post a snippet of what the error message said. I'll leave it unanswered until we can decide if this is #1 or #2 - but both can get some good answers today once the question is refined by an edit.
