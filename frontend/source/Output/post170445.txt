UI Guidelines : Left Navigation button should be a previous button <body> I've recently heard the that statement that the left navigation button should be a previous button and should not be used to display a menu.   Is that statement present in an offical guideline document or a WWDC video ?   <answer170447> In an official Apple HIG there's the statement:     When the user goes to a new level in a navigation hierarchy, two things should happen:      ul   liThe navigation bar title should change to the new level’s title, if appropriate./li   liA back button should appear in the left end of the bar; it can be labeled with the previous level’s title if it adds value./li   /ul   I do not recall any information about this in strongWWDC/strong videos.  <answer176394> I found the WWDC video that's going that direction :   Designing Intuitive User Experiences (Apple iOS developer membership required).
