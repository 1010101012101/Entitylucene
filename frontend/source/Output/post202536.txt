Make `hostname -f` return fully qualified hostname <body> How can i make codehostname/code (i.e. the unix commandline tool codehostname/code, invoked in terminal) return a hostname including the domain information?  At the moment, codehostname/code, codehostname -f/code and codehostname -s/code return the same name, all without the domain information, but codehost &lt;hostname&gt;/code returns the full hostname:  precode$ hostname &gt; jvf-imac $ hostname -f &gt; jvf-imac $ hostname -s &gt; jvf-imac $ host jvf-imac                                                                                                                                                                                      &gt; jvf-imac.fritz.box has address 192.168.178.31 /code/pre  The question is not about how I can get the full hostname in general. Some scripts I use rely on codehostname -f/code to get the fully qualified hostname, so I need to make codehostname -f/code return the correct hostname. Anyone any idea?  h1Updates/h1  h2System Overview/h2  ul liSystem Version: OS X 10.10.5 (14F27)/li liKernel Version: Darwin 14.5.0/li liComputer Name: jvf_imac/li /ul  h2Content of resolv.conf (shortened)/h2  precodedomain fritz.box nameserver 192.168.178.1 /code/pre  h2DNS Setup (shortened)/h2  precode$ scutil --dns                                                                                                                                                                                           resolver #1   search domain[0] : fritz.box   nameserver[0] : 192.168.178.1   if_index : 4 (en0)   flags    : Request A records   reach    : Reachable,Directly Reachable Address  resolver #2   domain   : local   options  : mdns   timeout  : 5   flags    : Request A records   order    : 300000  resolver #3   domain   : 254.169.in-addr.arpa ...  ...  resolver #7   domain   : b.e.f.ip6.arpa ...

If you aren't getting a FQDN out of hostname, you couod set a FQDN first.  The Mac tool is codescutil/code  precodescutil --get HostName            # same as hostname scutil --get LocalHostName       # same as hostname -s scutil --get ComputerName /code/pre  If you want strongjvf-imac.fritz.box/strong then simply:  precodesudo scutil --set HostName jvf-imac.fritz.box /code/pre  You could set the host name with codesudo hostname .../code as well and it wouldn't be wrong. If I were to guess, you probably have strongfritz.box/strong in code/etc/resolv.conf/code which is why the DNS lookup appends the domain name since you didn't specify one more fully.  <comment244301> In System Preferences  Sharing, what does t say the computer name is? I believe `hostname` gets the FQDN from there on OS X, whereas `host hostname` appears to query DNS (though I'm on 10.11â€¦) <comment244303> Forgive me, why is this helpful? The local machine name only gets an IP if connected to the network. The 'hostname' command is local, the 'host' command is network-based. Once you know the hostname you can ask DNS to resolve it for you. <comment244526> I agree with agentroadkill, I don't see how this is useful to my question, which is not about changing the hostname but to get the commandline tool  `hostname` to display the correct, full hostname including domain information. The part about the output of the `host` tool was only to show that my network setup and DNS seems to be working correctly otherwise... <comment244527> @jvf Please add your system version. I can't replicate the behavior of your system in Yosemite though I've enabled the (proxy-)dns setup of your Fritz!Box. <comment244528> Though the scutil part is an answer I would have given also as a work-around the second part is doubtful. Fritz!Box is a (german) home router which provides a DHCP and a (proxy-)DNS-server.  The standard domain name is fritz.box. Yesterday I setup a VM only connected to this router and I had no problems to get the fqdn of the Mac (=iMac.fritz.box) with hostname. <comment244529> @klanomath You are certainly right if the end problem is really how to make some fritz.box service work, but you can set your host name to be whatever you want whether or not it resolves or matches what the rest of the world expects :-) However, unless the OP does the work to explain how they really want a larger question answered - perhaps leaving that for a new thread works? As you commented, the details from the OP are lacking for us to dig into the deeper question at the moment. <comment244532> Mac OS X 10.10.5, newest Yosemite version <comment244537> Thanks for the answers and help so far. Setting the hostname with scutil works as a workaround. Of course I would be interested in finding a more general solution. Quite possible that the problem involves the dns proxy of the fritzbox. I'm happy to provide any additional info needed. If it is indeed the case, that fritzbox is the culprit here I'm also happy to change the original question to reflect this! <comment244541> @jvf I'd say start a new thread if you want to add more details. :). Simpler that way for everyone <comment244588> What DNS servers do you have configured?  Can you list them? <comment244678> @Allan I added the output out scutil --dns to the original question <comment244683> @jvf You may install dnsmasq via homebrew or [bind](http://packages.menandmice.com/bind/macosx/10.7-10.10/) and configure your own DNS-server @ home. No GUI available though (except you own OS X Server or install a [WebGUI](http://blog.philippklaus.de/2011/04/web-interfaces-for-the-bind-dns-server/))
