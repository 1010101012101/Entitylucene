Cannot start MySQL server with AppleScript - Snow Leopard <body> I've sucessfully installed MySQL server (5.5.11) on my MAC Snow Leopard. I can start the server using PreferencePane, using command line codesudo /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqld_safe/code but cannot use the same command within AppleScript.  This is the output from running codesudo /user/local/mysql/bin/mysql_safe/code:  precodengocminh@MBP[304]:~$ sudo /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqld_safe  Password: 110428 09:52:03 mysqld_safe Logging to '/usr/local/mysql/data/MBP.local.err'. 110428 09:52:03 mysqld_safe Starting mysqld daemon with databases from /usr/local/mysql/data /code/pre  Apache2 server can be started using the command codesudo apachetl start/code, then it could be implemented using an AppleScript script like this:  precodedo shell script "apachectl start" password "mypassword" user name "ngocminh" with administrator privileges /code/pre  However, I can't simply do the same for starting mysql server  precodedo shell script "/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqld_safe" password "mypassword" user name "ngocminh" with administrator privileges /code/pre  The apple script result says:  precode"110428 11:03:06 mysqld_safe Logging to '/usr/local/mysql/data/MBP.local.err'. 110428 11:03:06 mysqld_safe Starting mysqld daemon with databases from /usr/local/mysql/data 110428 11:03:06 mysqld_safe mysqld from pid file /usr/local/mysql/data/MBP.local.pid ended" /code/pre  Then MySQL server cannot be started!  Would anybody tell what's wrong with my script or I've missed something. Any suggestion will be highly appreciated. Thank you!  strong-- EDIT 1 --/strong  Try to run this script instead  precodedo shell script "apachectl start" password "mypassword" with administrator privileges do shell script "/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqld_safe &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;" password "mypassword" with administrator privileges /code/pre  No error reported by AppleScript but MySQL server is still not loaded according to codeps/code command  precodengocminh@MBP[315]:mysql$  ps aux | grep mysql root      5652   0.0  0.0  2435544    872 s000  T     9:51AM   0:00.04 /bin/sh /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqld_safe ngocminh 16127   0.0  0.0  2435120    528 s001  R+    2:30PM   0:00.00 grep mysql ngocminh@MBP[315]:mysql$  ps aux | grep http ngocminh 16141   0.0  0.0  2425524    172 s001  U+    2:30PM   0:00.00 grep http ngocminh 16092   0.0  0.0  2452692    644   ??

Although AppleScript doesn't report any error, MySQL server is not started. Please see update on question to see the output of commands.
