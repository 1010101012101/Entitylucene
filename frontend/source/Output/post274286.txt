Access to iTunes Store <body> I live in Hong Kong and have previously successfully accessed and downloaded music from the Apple iTunes Store via my iPhone 6 Plus.  Recently when I tried to repeat the process, all I could access was "Movies" which stated "The movies store in unavailable".  There is no way for me to navigate away from the movies page back to the music pages.    Has anybody experienced the same problem and does anyone have a solution?
