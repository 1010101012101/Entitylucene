Restoring Mac (with bootcamp) to factory settings <body> I am interested in restoring my Mac (i.e. wiping the OS X portion of my harddrive back to factory settings). However, I also have Windows 7 installed (via bootcamp) on my Mac (using 60GB of my hard drive).  Is it possible to restore the OS X portion of the machine without wiping the bootcamp portion as well? If anyone has successfully done this I would appreciate any information I can get on the process.
