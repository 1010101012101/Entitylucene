Youtube full screen lock screen on iPad <body> I have a iPad 3 with iOS 8.3 and the latest version of Youtube installed. When I watch a video and put it in full screen, the screen doesn't respond, doing nothing to me, nor exiting the full screen, so I'm forced to close the app and re-open it. The video goes on as if nothing was.  I've already tried reinstalling Youtube, doing forced reboot but nothing.  <comment358509> The latest version of the YouTube app requires iOS 9 at a minimum.  You're using an iOS version that's below the minimum so you'll probably experience instability and performance issues.  The iPad 3 can be updated to iOS 9 so can should do that upgrade.
