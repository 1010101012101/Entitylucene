Where does macports install programs <body> I have installed both moria and ettercap using MacPorts (via pallet) and I can't for the life of me find out where the things were installed to run them!  Where is the install directory?  EDIT: When I install things JUST using macports i.e. from the command line it works.  Pallet doesn't actually seem to install things :S  <answer47777> If you use contents, it will tell you where they are.  <answer47778> To find where any Unix commandline executable is located, use the codewhich/code command:  precode$ which bash /bin/bash $ which port /opt/local/bin/port /code/pre  <answer47796> Unless you performed a custom installation of MacPorts everything installed by MacPorts is located conveniently at   precode/opt/local  /code/pre  if you perform a directory listing at that location you should see the structure for port installed programs which should be installed in bin or sbin directories.  precodeuser$ ls bin     etc     include lib     libexec man     sbin    share   var  /code/pre  As noted in the MacPorts Documentation     2.3. Install MacPorts      If you are using Mac OS X, you should install MacPorts using the Mac OS X package installer unless you do not wish to install it to /opt/local/, the default MacPorts location, or if you wish to install a pre-release version of MacPorts base. However, if you wish to install multiple copies of MacPorts or install MacPorts on another OS platform, you must install MacPorts from the source code.   <answer269359> Yes, you have to explicitly point to the new app to get it to run:  code/opt/local/bin/openssl/code   -- in my case, otherwise you get the Apple version.  <comment54745> port contents only works on installed ports, FYI. <comment54748> when I use the command i just get Port ettercap-ng does not contain any files or is not active. I clicked the install button inside pallet... <comment136356> This won't work if you are trying to find a MacPorts version of a binary which also has a Mac OS version, e.g. `which find` will return `/usr/bin/find` whereas if you've installed findutils that version (on my install) goes in `/opt/local/libexec/gnubin/find`. <comment245174> You cannot use **which** to find packages installed via ports.
