opening dictation changes sound from 2 channel to 1 (headphones) <body> I am using a MacBook Pro Mid 2015 running macOS Sierra.  I started using dictation recently, but I noticed that once I had it turned on, the sound output not only became quieter but worse in quality (tinny and improperly balanced) while I was using my bluetooth headphones. To investigate, I turned off dictation and restarted my computer and opened audio MIDI setup as part of this guide. My built-in output reads 2 ch 24-bit integer 44.1kHz. My headphones are also 2 channel. Then, I go into system preferences  keyboard. As soon as I even click on the dictation tab (dictation is still not enabled) my headphones switch to 1 channel output (1 ch 16-bit Integer 16.0 kHz). If I then plug in earbuds into the audio jack (not bluetooth) and wait a few seconds, I go back to 2 channels on the bluetooth headphones, but as soon as I remove the earbuds from the audio jack I get the same 1 channel issue. I've also tried running the codesudo killall coreaudiod/code command, to no success.  I also looked at this post but my issue isn't muting.
