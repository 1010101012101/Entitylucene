iCloud Mail and iOS Mail auto-completes bunch of eMail addresses <body> Since a few weeks, my iOS Mail app and the iCloud webmail started to complete the mail addresses that I type in the "To" field in a funny way. It doesn't complete only single addresses, but tries to find all the contacts that were in a conversation before.  This is very annoying, since I accidentally sent mails to the wrong people by this. How can I disable this behaviour?
