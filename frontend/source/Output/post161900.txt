How to debug my webcam problems? <body> I'm quite a new OS X user and come from a linux background - usually to debug my problems I consult the logs as per code/var/log/syslog/code however with Yosemite i'm not sure what i'm looking for.  Any way my problem is that I will load Skype and video call someone which works fine but the moment my mac is locked or goes into hibernation mode the next time I try video call the web cam is not detected - if i attempt to use Photo Booth this too doesn't detect a webcam.  Some google searches has revealed it's a conflict where the camera is "in use" when it isn't - and other articles seem to point towards AirParrot which i do not have installed.  ol liHow would I determine where the fault is?/li liHow do I then resolve this fault?/li /ol  Rebooting does seem to be a solution but IMO theres a bug that needs fixing because rebooting to get a cam to work is just simply absurd - even Windows can function more reliably.  <answer161901> As commented by @aglasser to fix the Cam not working simply:  ul liOpen codeTerminal.app/code; and/li liRun: codesudo killall VDCAssistant/code/li /ul  In order to resolve another similar issue with the built-in Microphone:  ul liOpen codeTerminal.app/code; and/li liRun: codesudo killall coreaudio/code/li /ul  <answer161916> Running disk utility and reinstalling the O/S are probably not the best first things to do.strongExcept/strong you can run disk utility (/Applications/Utilities) and select your Mac HD and click on repair permissions. That strongwill/strong work while you are logged on and started from your main startup volume. Permissions can get munged and doing this is usually quick, easy and a decent first step.  Logs can all be found by running the console.app in /Applications/Utilities. Being a linux guy you are probably well on your way once you've found the logs.  <comment189147> When this happens, open Terminal and run `sudo killall VDCAssistant`. I have an issue with my webcam as well where moving the screen will disconnect the camera... Killing `VDCAssistant` fixes my issue sometimes. <comment189148> Legend - thanks for the quick reply works a charm.  I would never have known how to do this :P <comment374091> See my answer here https://stackoverflow.com/a/45861186/825364
