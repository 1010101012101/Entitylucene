Sort trash files by date trashed <body> One of the nice features of the recycle bin in Windows is the ability to sort it by the date an item was deleted. This way if you accidentally delete something, you can easily find it because it will be at the top of the list.  Is there any way to do something similar in Mac OS X's Trash folder?  I see that there is a date modified field, but that is not updated when the file is deleted.  <answer7959> I don't think there is anything exactly like that in Mac OS X.  However, if you accidentally deleted something in the Finder, you can use the "Undo" command to move the file back.  <answer11653> Why do you use the Trash as a "backup folder" ??  I'll suggest that you use the build in Time Machine, and then only use the Trash for the stuff you really want to delete.  That is what the build in backup solution (Time Machine) are there for - finding old files that has been deleted or modified.   <answer13795> This hint from emMac OS X Hints/em describes how to create a simple Automator Folder Action that performs codetouch/code on every file that's trashed.  <answer72068> emUpdate for OSX 10.9 Mavericks:/em  It appears that you can now sort by Date Added in OSX Mavericks.

It's okay to include a link, but please summarize or excerpt it in the answer. The idea is to make the answer stand alone. <comment146733> Does the Date Added field actually show anything for anybody? Mine shows -- for every file in the Trash. Sorting by Date Added does nothing either. <comment146753> Phong, I'm looking at it right now and mine shows a date in the Date Added column (on Mavericks). As to why it might be blank on Mavericks, I'm not sure. <comment146754> I've also seen someone else mention the Date Added column somewhere else. They said their column showed -- for all files in the Trash, but clicking the column header actually sorts the files somehow... <comment147893> Weirdly enough, Date Added started getting populated in my Trash…?
