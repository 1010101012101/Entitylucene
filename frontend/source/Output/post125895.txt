homebrew broken after time machine restore <body> I use home-brew for some tools on my macbook and it had been working fine. I recently put a SSD in my macbook and restored it to a time machine backup as I thought this would give me a pretty good replica of what my system was previously. However, since doing that, whenever I call a command that home-brew installed I am given the following error:  precode-bash: ffmpeg: command not found /code/pre  ffmpeg is just one example. All of my commands are listed when I enter codebrew list/code so its not as if they aren't there at all. The codebrew/code command itself still works (codebrew help/code, codebrew doctor/code etc) so that isn't missing.  I still have the old hard drive where it all worked fine. What files should I copy over from there to get my brew packages to run properly again? Or is there a brew command I can use that will fix it all for me? I tried codebrew doctor/code and codebrew upgrade ffmpeg/code but that didn't help.  How can I get this running again? Preferably avoiding uninstalling everything and starting again...  <answer136846> you can brew unlink and brew link for each app.  if its painful for you, you can back up from your timemachine "after boot".  if you import data from your timemachine at starting your machine, brew broken.  but after you start up your machine at once, you will success!  <comment147355> Does `/usr/local/bin/ffmpeg` or `/usr/local/Cellar/ffmpeg/*/bin/ffmpeg` work? You could also try running `brew unlink ffmpeg;brew link ffmpeg` or `brew uninstall ffmpeg;brew install ffmpeg`. <comment147367> `sam$ /usr/local/Cellar/ffmpeg/2.1.4/bin/ffmpeg dyld: Library not loaded: /usr/local/lib/libx264.125.dylib   Referenced from: /usr/local/Cellar/ffmpeg/2.1.4/bin/ffmpeg   Reason: image not found Trace/BPT trap: 5` So that didn't work. `Uninstall ffmpeg` then `install ffmpeg` does work but thats just a real pain to have to do for every package that I have! Im really not happy with Time Machine for this... I thought the whole idea was that it backed EVERYTHING up for this scenario :( <comment162455> or you can just do this :: brew link $(brew list) <comment181839> possible duplicate of [packages installed with Homebrew not found after restore](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/129991/packages-installed-with-homebrew-not-found-after-restore)
