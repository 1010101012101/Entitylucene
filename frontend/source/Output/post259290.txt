How can I correct the screen going blank whenever I run nettop? <body> I'm running the latest version of macOS and always just use Terminal. Not iTerm or anything like that.  Whenever I run nettop, the screen goes blank. Sometimes it happens immediately, and sometimes after I press an arrow key.  How do I keep this from happening?  I just tried coder/code to redraw the screen, but that didn't help.  <answer274810> Try to make your terminal screen bigger. It fixed mine!  <answer274997> I sent a bug report about this to Apple. Someone there knew that nettop had been given more columns too display, so he suggested I widen the window. I did this, and found that nettop worked correctly from then on.  I suggested that the default dimensions of the Terminal window be changed to 90*27.  <comment345855> I solved this problem quite some time ago with Apple's support team. I'm so sorry I never gave the answer here!
