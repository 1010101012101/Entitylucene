"brew formula" installation logs <body> Sometimes I install a formula with Brew, and I get a series of warnings and notifications.   At some point later, I want to go back and read what problems the installation found.   Does brew automatically keep track of these installation logs?  If not, is there any way I could instruct it (perhaps with a parameter) to always record the installation log on a file?  <answer120812> Logs are stored in strong~/Library/Homebrew/Logs/strong.br You can browse this in Finder or using Console.app.  hr  If you want to save your own log of an install, you can useâ€¦  precodebrew install &lt;formula&gt; 2&gt;&amp;1 | tee install.log /code/pre  supSource: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/issues/10430/sup
