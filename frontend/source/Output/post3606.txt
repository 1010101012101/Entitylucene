How can I choose to unrar with the default application? <body> I recently installed unrar for Mac Os X but i found it useless sometimes and bug-full. So i uninstalled unrar. Now if i open a .rar file, another application (VLC) open it. But i want the default unrar application to manage .rar files. How can i do that? If i select the "Open with" options and i look for that application in the applications folder i cant find it.  <answer3609> There's no default application to handle .rar file on Mac OS X.  You might want to try strongThe Unarchiver/strong. It can open many format besides emrar/em files.  Then once you installed it, open its preferences and select all the file format you want him to manage.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AipGR.png" alt="unarchiver"  <comment3334> +agreed... the unarchiver works better than the default decompression utility anyway, and Loic is right, the default will not work with .rar files. <comment3339> the unarchiver it is. Handles lot's of file formats.
