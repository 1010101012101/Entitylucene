bridge CDCmodem and wifi on mac OSX 10.9.3 <body> I am not a professional in IT. I am looking for a way to bridge OSX wifi with CDC modem (datacard). I tried using the internet sharing but then the wifi makes a new SSID network and disconnects from the parent LAN. Please suggest a way and if possible a step by step procedure. hoping to get some help out here.  Details: MAC OSX 10.9.3 DATACARD: prithvi UE 100 (CDMA EVDO REV A)
