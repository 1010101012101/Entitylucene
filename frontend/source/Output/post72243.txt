What to do if OS X Facebook notifications are unreliable? <body> with the release of OS X 10.8.2, strongFacebook notifications/strong have been introduced. But so far, I'm having problems with the reliability of those: they only appear randomly. Compared to the amount of Notification Center pop ups I emshould/em get, I estimate I only receive 10% of all notifications.  Is this the same for you? Do you have any idea how to fix this?  <answer72738> I've been using http://glowforfb.com for two weeks now and haven't missed strongone/strong notification since then :)!  Cheers  <answer82199> The notifications appear to be the same as what would be seen in the iOS app. It picks up post from friends who are active and sends out a notification for their post. I have a few friends with high volume of post and these friends are a constant source of my notifications. Other than that I am unsure of how the notifications are handled.  <comment83895> Same here! And I canâ€™t even choose what notifications I get. <comment86610> Exactly same here, it's a feature which is not implemented in FB integration yet. You've to wait to work it properly. Try some other apps instead.
