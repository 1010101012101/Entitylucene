How do I find my hostname for my google account? <body> Can you help me figure out what my hostname for my google account would be? I'm setting up Fetch (FTP) and I need my hostname for my gmail.  <answer56180> If you are using some FTP client you need to connect to their IP Address AFAIK, so with this you can try accessing GMAIL's IP (74.strong*.235./strong) and enter your username and password as other FTP Client is doing.  HTH  <comment64482> Err, I'm confused. Why would you want to use Fetch to access your Email account? <comment64484> Are you on a Mac, iOS device, or some other "FTP" client? <comment64494> Which hostname are you looking for? The SMTP server hostname? <comment64502> I am a Macintosh user. Wanting to know how to access my hostname. Is it the IP address or a name?? <comment64504> @Lila Have you tried your username or your IP? <comment64506> I tried IP address. Does not connect. Says it timed out. I don't know what the username would be.
