Mid-2012 rMBP only connects to 5GHz at lower channel values? <body> When the AC router's 5GHz channel is set to operate between channels 36 and 64, my rMBP (mid-2012) can connect to the wireless router just fine, however at very low speeds. But as soon as I change the range to 100 and 140, the rMBP can't detect the wireless signal anymore. Is there a reason behind this ?   My Apple TV and it's connected to the 5GHz with no problem, and it's at least a year or two old. My PS4 can't connect to 5GHz though.  The router I'm using is the Asus RT-AC87U  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/w6dA6.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment195545> @Buscar웃 What do you mean ? What profile ? <comment195546> hold alt click on wifi icon and copy that information for us <comment195551> @Buscar웃 updated OP <comment195552> ok, that one looks just fine and it is high speed connection to your Router. <comment195554> @Buscar웃 But it doesn't function fine though .. I couldn't even upload that image on imgur when using the 5GHz network, I had to use the 2.4GHz one. Websites load like 56k modems on the 5GHz network using any channels below 100.
