CD/DVD sharing not working <body> I'm trying to share a CD/DVD drive from windows 7 laptop with my MacBook Pro mid 2010 through a WiFi. I've done all the things specified in official apple guide on how to do this, which was:  ul liInstall a software update for Windows 7/li liEnable CD/DVD sharing + ask for permission/li liDisable a firewall (actually, there is only a default windows firewall installed but with both enabled and disabled states, this thing is not working)/li /ul  And, according to what the guide says, from that point, i should see a shared drive in my codeDevices/code section in finder. However, there is no codeShared drive/code section, osx does not see that drive.  Tutorial link: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5287?viewlocale=en_US  Is there any way to debug why that thing is not working? Or Maybe i have forgot to do something crucial? Thanks in advance for any clues.  <comment163943> Which guide are you referring to (a link would be helpful)? <comment163947> right, i'm sorry, link added to the original question.
