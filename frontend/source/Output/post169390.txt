How to minimize all windows except the selected ones? <body> Ok, if you use kbdALT/kbd + kbdCMD/kbd + kbdH/kbd you can hide all windows except the active one.  How can I minimize (or hide) all windows except a set of 3 or 4 windows chosen by the user? Is there any app for that?  <comment198944> `⌥ALT`+`⌘CMD`+`H` does not minimize the windows - it hides them. Minimized windows are visible on the Dock. Hidden windows are not. <comment198957> @MateuszSzlosek Note that this is dependent on a system preferences setting. It can be set such that minimized windows minimize into their respective Dock icon and not as a separate window on the right of the Dock. <comment198959> @BartArondson You're right, but this is still minimized state. Hidden =/= Minimized. <comment198960> Yes, you are right. However, when they minimize to the Dock icon it is nearly the same AFAIK. <comment199004> I'm not very familiar with the most accepted term, Minimize or Hide. Someone edited the question already, thanks.
