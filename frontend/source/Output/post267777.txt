Why can't I connect to an IP address from my Mac, when other machines can? <body> I can't seem to ping (or connect in any other way) to an IP address (code192.168.1.144/code) on my network from my Mac laptop, when other machines in can.  The other machines are connected in the same way to the home network (same SSID) and ping the target machine(s) OK. I check at the same time by SSH'ing into them.  I can connect to the main router and to the internet OK, but not to code192.168.1.144/code or any other machine on the same part of the network (such as code192.168.1.2/code).  The network setup is:  code[me - 192.168.1.71 ] =&gt; (wireless) =&gt; 192.168.1.1 =&gt; (wired) =&gt; 192.168.1.2 =&gt; (wireless) =&gt; 192.168.1.144/code  If I connect to code192.168.1.2/code using it as a wireless access point (I have to go physically downstairs to do so), everything works OK.  To make things funnier, it seems that if I connect via using a Perl ping module in a program I wrote and use to scan the network, I reach code192.168.1.144/code and others too.  I'm running Mac OS X 10.11.4 (15E65)  I emhave/em tried turning it off and on again (it being both the Mac and the router in question).
