Convert audio to OGG format via Terminal <body> Is there an app or a method that I can use from Terminal to convert audio files to the OGG format?  I know about codeafconvert/code but that doesn't provide the codeogg/code format that I want.  <answer121082> have a look at sox and ffmpeg they should do it.  precodeffmpeg -i file.mp3 -acodec ogg file.ogg /code/pre  i think that was the command i used. not sure used to be a long time ago.  also have a look here why you probably wont do a conversion: https://askubuntu.com/questions/147944/bulk-batch-convert-mp3-files-to-ogg-via-command-line  <answer121099> Ogg is a container format. It typically uses the Vorbis audio codec. You can download a static build of codeffmpeg/code and use the bundled codelibvorbis/code encoder:  precodeffmpeg -i input.wav -c:a libvorbis -qscale:a 5 output.ogg /code/pre  According to the Vorbis encoding guide, the quality range is from 0–10, where 10 is the highest quality and 3–6 are a good range to try. In the above example we used 5 as quality.  <answer263568> I've come across this question a couple of times, this is what worked for me:  precode$ ffmpeg -y -i foo.mp3  -strict -2 -acodec vorbis -ac 2 -aq 50 foo.ogg /code/pre  Source: http://infoheap.com/ffmpeg-convert-mp3-to-ogg-on-mac/  <comment141134> `ogg` is not a valid FFmpeg encoder. Your command does not work.
