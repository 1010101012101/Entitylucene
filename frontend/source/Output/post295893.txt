WebDAV write permissions in macOS Server 5 <body> I have a Mac Mini running macOS Sierra (10.12.6) and Server 5 (5.3.1), and an iMac running the same software. Both are connected to the same router/DSL modem. The Mini hosts web pages that can be accessed from the outside world (including the iMac) at address codehttps://SomeDomain.com/…/code without any problem.  On the Mini, I created a folder codeTestWebDAV/codeon the admin's Desktop and put a codeTest.txt/code file in it. Then I created a WebDAV share in the Server app. Access is only granted through WebDAV (all other boxes are unchecked: iOS, SMB, AFP…) and I granted read &amp; write permissions to all users.  On the iMac's Finder, a codecmd-K/code shortcut allows me to connect to the Mini using codehttps://SomeDomain.com/webdav/TestWebDAV/code address. The Finder asks for Mini's user credentials (any user will do), then it mounts the WebDAV share and I can read the contents of codeTest.txt/code.  The problem is I can't save edits made to codeTest.txt/code, and I can't drag &amp; drop files from the iMac to the WebDAV share. In the latter case, the Finder strangely asks for the iMac's admin credentials (why?), then the copy fails with an error message: codeItems can’t be copied to “TestWebDAV” because you don’t have permission to read them/code (uh?).  Any help would be greatly appreciated. Also, where is the log file showing what the WebDAV/Apache error code is?  (Note: all AFP connections from the iMac to the Mini are working 100%.)  <comment373699> IMHO - I'd put the TestWebDAV folder someplace other than on the Admin's Desktop! <comment373719> Sure. But it's just for testing purposes. <comment373735> You may be having problems _because_ the folder is in the Administrator's account. Try moving it to another partition or external disk.
