Gmail in iPhone: How to delete on swipe? <body> On iphone 3GS I have iOS version 4.1 running. The thing is when I swipe a mail in my Gmail account on iPhone, it always displays the codeArchive/code button. So, to delete some mail in my inbox I always have to open the mail, use the codeMove to/code button to move it to codeTrash/code.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/igVJH.png" alt="alt text"  In Yahoo email account and other accounts however, it displays a codeDelete/code button on swiping on a mail.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GN6Aj.png" alt="alt text"  How can I set Gmail to show codeDelete/code button on swiping?  Regards  <answer5399> ul liGo to the iPhone Home screen. /li liOpen Settings. /li liSelect Mail, Contacts, Calendars. /li liOpen the desired Gmail account under Accounts. /li liMake sure Archive Messages is OFF./li /ul  To make swiping archive mail (and remove it from the current folder, but keep it under "All Mail"), make sure Archive Messages is ON.   Just an addition for iOS6: there is an alternative for swiping: When Archive Messages is OFF, the Archive button turns into a trash can. When Archive Messages is ON you can press and hold the archive button in the right-hand corner to delete the message.
