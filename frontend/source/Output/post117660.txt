Can I run two non-thunderbolt displays from a thunderbolt RAID device? <body> It seems like this question has been asked a million times, but after a few hours of reading similar questions, I have not been able to find a clear answer.  I have a mid-2012 Macbook Air running OS X 10.9. I want to run dual 24" 1920x1200 monitors emand/em the built-in 11" screen.  Can I use a thunderbolt RAID device (i.e. Promise Pegasus R4 or anything else with two thunderbolt ports out) to drive two monitors?  Will this work:  MBA - RAID - 2x miniDP to DVI adaptors - 2x 24" screens  <answer117684> No, not with the Promise Pegasus R4 has only two Thunderbolt ports. One you will need to connect to the MBA and then other to your miniDP adapter. You would need a Thunderbolt dock that has another Thunderbolt port or another video interface like HDMI, etc.  Something like this: http://www.caldigit.com/thunderboltstation/,etc  <comment137592> Wow. That makes so much sense! I assumed there was a third TB "in" port for some reason. <comment148166> Make sure you read the FAQ page for the CalDigit product (http://www.caldigit.com/thunderboltstation/faq.asp). It states "the Thunderbolt Station can support two monitors *if one of them is an Apple Thunderbolt Display*". It doesn't support two non Thunderbolt monitors.
