How to forward iPhone SMS with original received/sent date stamps attached on iOS 6.1 <body> I receive text messages on my iPhone. When I forward them, the original sender's contact info and date time stamp do not forward with it.  Is there a way to include this information when forwarding to my email?  <answer146084> sms will always have the time stamp from the time and sender of the message.  not the message you're quoting.  if you want some evidence of timing etc, take a screen cap of original message and send that as an mms to the next person.  clunky, but might help  <comment172096> 'forwarding to my email' â€” you're forwarding SMS to your email?
