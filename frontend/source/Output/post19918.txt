How to create an encrypted volume on an external drive or flash drive <body> How do you encrypt an external hard/flash drive connected to my Mac in Lion 10.7? Preferable something with a strong encryption as FileVault.   <answer19919> You can create an encrypted volume using Disk Utility:  http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1578  Also, see here for information on FileVault:  Is File Vault 2 whole disk encryption or whole partition encryption?  <answer19920> The best way to do this is via Disk Utility in the Application/Utilities folder.  Review pictures for better understanding  Select the disk you want to encrypt img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UkDUP.png" alt="Disk Utility"  Choose the format method as in the picture, making sure you choose the option with Encryption img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/paUFj.png" alt="Choose format"  Next time you connect the disk, you will be asked to enter password. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WjvI6.png" alt="Here is what it looks like after you are done"  <comment21944> The article describes how to create an encrypted disk image. That is not the same as FileVault. But it is also just as secure, and more backwards compatible (you can read it from older OS X versions, too), which is important for external drives, I would think. <comment22308> Is this a new Lion feature? <comment22506> Yes it is and it's very good.
