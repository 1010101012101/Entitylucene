Removing locked items from Users/Login Items on OSX 10.7.3? <body> My laptop was distributed by corporate IT. I have two items in my Login Items which cannot be hidden or removed. See screen shot...  Inside the /Library/Managed Preferences/juba/loginwindow.plist file I see reference to these two items. It is searching for a server which is of course not found unless I am connected to the corporate network. I work remotely and do not regularly connect to that network.  How can I remove these items?  <comment84808> Do you have administrator powers on your computer? If no, how you remove the items might be to contact corporate IT. <comment84811> You forgot to attach the screenshot. <comment84821> +1 Daniel Lawson.  If your account is managed, that means they manage whatever they want on it.  You need administrator access to override that.
