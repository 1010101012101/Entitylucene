Lost 32GB on my Macintosh HD <body> I created a 32 GB partition on my Mac where I installed Ubuntu, then I've deleted the partition from disk utility having errors, I restarted my mac and now I can't see the 32 GB space anymore. As you can see from this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bjR5v.png" alt="enter image description here"  I've got 500GB total HD. But Macintosh HD is 464 GB:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vumhg.png" alt="enter image description here"  And in the partition section I can't see other available space!  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9h24D.png" alt="enter image description here"   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/p1ocw.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment224507> Could you open Terminal and type `diskutil list` and provide a screenshot of the output. <comment224533> Resize the partition from 464.32 GB to 500 GB. Not sure about it working. May corrupt data. I am not responsible for any data loss. <comment224588> I've added the screenshot, I can see only that disk. I can't resize the partition, it just give me no free space <comment224599> Your "Recovery HD" partition has the wrong GUID type in the GPT. I see "Apple_HFS" and it should be "Apple_Boot". The Terminal command to fix this is `gpt`, but you must first boot to an external drive or to internet recovery. Do you know how to do either of these? Also, I will need you to post the output from the command `sudo gpt  -r  list  /dev/disk0`. Once the GPT is fixed, you can use the Disk Utility to recover the lost space. <comment224607> @DavidAnderson, hasn't  the boot volume also another type as it should be? I'm not sure. My 10.10.3 boot disk has the type "Apple_CoreStorage". I've heard this was done in some Yosemite update (it converted the volume). <comment224613> @Zero: There is no requirement to use core storage unless you have a Fusion drive and/or need encryption. In this case, core storage is not being used. I have never used core storage with any version of Yosemite. <comment224617> Ok. I also have never used it and I formatted the boot disk a long time ago. But it has been changed to that type by an OS X update. <comment224648> Thank you guys for all the answers, but I preferred to format everything. Just downloaded Yosemite and put it in a thumb drive, then erased the disk and installed Yosemite back, the HD now see all the free space. <comment224719> I did exactly the same when I tried to install Ubuntu and somehow Bootcamp or whatever it was, failed (it's a long time ago). I never tried that again lol.
