Force Word 2011 to retain source formatting when pasting to a different document <body> I frequently copy/cut and paste between one document and another.  The text is always in "Times New Roman" but when I paste the pasted text is in "Calibri (Body)", despite the fact that the "Paste Options" button shows "Keep Source Formatting".  If I try "Paste and Match Formatting" then (strangely enough) it keeps the correct font, but it loses other formatting such as indention.  I have tried disabling "Use smart cut and paste" from  codeWord -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Edit -&gt; Cut and Paste Options/code but this had no effect.  I only have the problem when I paste to a different (Word) document than the one I copied or cut the text from.  When pasting to the same document the font is preserved as expected.  How do I actually preserve the original font when pasting text?
