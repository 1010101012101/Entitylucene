How do I count words in a PDF file on OS X? <body> I'd like to count words on a PDF file on OS X. The inspector doesn't contain the word count.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TiRqb.png" width="400"/  <answer252363> Use the built-in tool ps2ascii,   precode$ ps2ascii MSWiM_2016.pdf | wc -w *** Warning: composite font characters dumped without decoding.     8964 /code/pre  <comment314002> Keep in mind that many PDF files are collections of images not of text so the word count would be  0 or very low. <comment314083> One possibility is to attempt to export the PDF to text, and do the word count there. This is actually also what one would do using Acrobat.
