Where on the file system are my photos imported to? <body> I'm using OS X Yosemite 10.10.5.  I have connected my Canon PowerShot A3400 IS Camera via USB to my Mac and automatically a window launched that imported my photos.  The Photos application (version 1.0.1 (215.65.0)) launched and I can see my photos within it.  My question is, where on the file system are these photos?  I want to import these into a Google photo album but don’t see any option in the Photos application to save them somewhere and I can’t seem to find them in the Finder app.  <answer220436> If you're using the Photos application then your imported pictures can be found at:  precode~/Pictures/Photos Library /code/pre  This is a special folder. If you double click on it in Finder it'll open the Photos application instead of showing you the contents of the folder. To see the contents, right click on the folder in Finder and select codeShow Package Contents/code from the menu.  Once you're inside the special folder the unaltered master photos are in the codeMasters/code sub-directory sorted in to year and then month then day sub-folders.  If you're trying to find the path to the location from a Terminal command line it's:  precode~/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary /code/pre  <answer220437> They are stored within your Photos Library, but Apple don't really want you to play in there, so they make it awkward to get to.  If you want to play the game the way Apple intended, then the simplest way is to either Share them from in Photos, or to drag them from the photos app to your desktop, or any specific folder.  If you want to 'break the rules' then you can open the Library 'file' - which is really just a special folder with its contents hidden from the casual observer - by right clicking the Library &amp; selecting 'Show Package Contents'br This will open it as a folder; your original pictures are located within the Masters folder.br Don't delete things from there, just copy things out of it, or you will confuse Photos.  To get to the Library file, if you're struggling to find it…   ul liOpen a new Finder window using kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd N /kbd  /li liGo To… kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd Shift ⇧ /kbd kbd G /kbd  /li liCopy paste this - code~/Pictures/Photos Library/code including the tilde code~/code &amp; hit kbd Enter ⌅ /kbd /li /ul  <answer220438> Your OS X Photos library is stored in the "Pictures" section of the Finder sidebar.  If you right-click on the Photos Library itself and click "Show Package Contents", your "master" copies of the photos are stored in /Masters/ and are sorted by year, month, day.  Edit: Alternatively, you can use this Mac app as a sharing extension to share to Google Drive right from the Photos app itself.  <answer220472> As long as you don't click "import" in the Photos app, the files are still on your camera's flash drive and not actually imported to you hard disk.  The camera's filesystem should also be mounted in the Finder. On the command-line, all mount-points are accessible under code/Volumes/code.  <answer259178> I follow this method - click on the desktop icon "Mcintosh HD" (it looks like a hard drive and I have no idea how it came on my desktop. Guess it's been there forever)  Users  My name [in my case "Sudipto" next to the icon of a small hut (the other two are guest and shared)]  Pictures  All the folders are neatly stacked here by date, month and year. You can back up the entire pictures folder or the sub folders.  I hope this helps.   <comment266791> Althouhg I can see my camera photos in the  Photos application in the "Import" tab, when I run "ls ~/Pictures/Photos\ Library.photoslibrary/Masters" in a termianl, it comes up empty.  Would this be the right path? <comment266794> Hi, I opened a new Finder window but there is no o"Pictures" section in the left sidebar.  I only have (under favorites) "Dropbox," "All My Files," "iCloud Drive," "AirDrop," "Applications," "Desktop," "Documents," and "Downloads."  Also "ls /Masters" produces "No such file or directory" in a terminal. <comment266795> In Photos, go to Preferences (⌘,) and click the General tab. Click on the "Show in Finder" button beside the label "Library Location". This will take you to your Photos Library <comment266802> @Dave what's the "import tab"? That's not anything in Photos I'm familiar with.
