Step-by-step checklist for iOS <body> I am looking for an app that works on the Mac as well as on the iPad.  At work we have daily tasks that do not occur on a set schedule (aka they are on an as needed basis).  This app would allow us to create checklists for these tasks (think pre-flight checklist for airline pilots) that would be "resettable" and reusable.   Any thoughts?  <answer180848> There's a ton of different ToDo list apps out there.

OmniFocus seems to be the most feature-rich currently (this might be subjective)
