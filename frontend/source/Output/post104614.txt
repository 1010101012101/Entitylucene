How can I tell the time with an Apple TV? <body> I'd like to tell the time with my Apple TV, so I don't have to use a computer. But I can't seem to find a single clock app or screensaver for Apple TV. Anyone know if one exists?  I'm using an Apple TV 3, with Apple TV Software 6.0.  <answer213891> Sorry for the shameless plug, but I made the app just because Apple TV lacks the time: Screen Clock.
