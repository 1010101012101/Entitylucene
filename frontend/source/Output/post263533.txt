Unable to make bootable windows usb (El Capitan) <body> I have tried everything in the book. I have tried using disk utility to restore the windows ISO image file. I have tried restoring the image file to my usb through terminal commands. I have tried using the bootcamp assistant. And they have all failed. I've tried converting the .ISO to a .dmg but still no luck.  When using disk utility, I get an error that says something like "Could not restore. Invalid Argument."  When I try to use bootcamp to do this, it says that it can't because the start-up drive is not a single partition (it is).   When I try doing it through terminal commands, the files copy over, but neither my mac nor my PC see it as a bootable windows drive. I'm frustrated and burned out of ideas on how to fix this. It really shouldn't be this hard.  I'm wondering if it has something to do with my hard drive being encrypted. I have started the decryption process, but that will take days to finish. Is there another way to do this? It seems like nothing will work.
