Syncing iTunes to iPod Touch..certificate not found <body> With iTunes version 12.5.5.5 I get the following message when trying to sync my iPod Touch with iTunes...iTunes can't verify the identity of the server "safebrowsing.clients.google.com". The certificate for this server is invalid.   When I have done Internet searches on this particular problem, one answer is that iTunes/Apple needs to fix this. If so, when? Do I have to just do without while I am waiting for a potential revision to iTunes?  Another answer was to clear the history on Safari on the iPod Touch and try again. I did that. Same problem persists with syncing.  Another answer was to roll back to iTunes v. 12.5.4.42. However, I have been unable to find that version on the Internet to roll back to. I can only find the latest version which is the one I have that has the problem.   Where can I find the older version of iTunes and how do I install it and uninstall the latest version?  <comment342261> Downgrade file avail.
