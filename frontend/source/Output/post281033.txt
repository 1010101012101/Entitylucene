Sending ctrl+function key on iTerm2 <body> Byobu has some keybindings that require a modifier key and a function key, like Shift+f2 or Ctrl+f7. Unfortunately macOS picks these up instead and does god knows what with them. How do I send these key combinations to iTerm2?  <answer294552> You can disable shortcuts used by MacOS. To do this:  ul liOpen strongSystem Preferences/strong (under the Apple menu) /li liSelect strongKeyboard/strong/li liClick strongShortcuts/strong/li /ul  Here you'll see several sets of shortcuts you can toggle. The two lists you'll want to look at are strongMission Control/strong and strongKeyboard/strong. Uncheck anything that uses a function key. Your various function keys should now work inside Byobu.  Notes:  You can change whether you have to hold strongFn/strong to use a function key. Under the strongKeyboard/strong emtab/em, check "Use F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys."  While you're in the shortcuts tab, you might scroll around and see what other shortcuts MacOS has to offer. You might see something useful to you or notice another keyboard shortcut that's been getting in your way.   <comment353563> Did you try with & without Fn ? e.g. Shift/F2 & Shift/Fn/F2 <comment353565> yes and it still doesn't work <comment371886> Already disabled FN for function keys. It's just annoying.  It's also not related to the question. <comment371964> That part was under the Notes section and was intended to provide extra context to other people coming here with the same (or similar) question.  The main part of the answer is above the Notes. Were you able to solve your problem by disabling the function key shortcuts?
