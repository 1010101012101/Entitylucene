How do I call myself using Facetime? <body> I have Facetime on my MacBook and Facetime on my iPad.  Of course I also have one Apple ID account.  Sometimes the family uses the iPad while I'm away.  I'd like to be able to call "myself", that is my iPad from my MacBook.  How do I do this?  <answer15860> In this case I dont think it is possible with the way Facetime is configured.   Facetime has some sort of reverse dialing mechanism associated with your apple id. That means you need to dial out to a different unique id.   If you create a second apple id for this purpose and associate it with the iPad or the macbook, you should be able to call them when you are away.  <answer15862> The short answer - you can either call a phone number (iPhone + FaceTime) or an AppleID (iPod/Mac/iPad + FaceTime) and you can't call another device with the same number.  To call back to your mac (or any other AppleID device) - you'll have to make a second account with a different Apple ID. Similarly - there's no easy way to get the phone number into another device since that gets authenticated over SMS in the background and not user/password for AppleID.  If you are calling from an iPhone - you can call your AppleID devices (they all ring and any one can pick up), but for AppleID based calls - you need to call a different AppleID unless Apple ever changes the current software.  Last clarification - AppleID is just a string but most people use an email address since that is more likely to be unique to one person.  <answer15898> Go to the Settings app in your iPad. Navigate to Facetime on the left column. Under "You can be reached for video calls at:", click "Add Another Email..." You should be able to call your alternative email address from your MacBook.  <answer100816> You need to make sure that the email or phone number is the main device and different one each device.  <comment17254> For clarification, for each Apple device a person owns, one will need a unique Apple ID AND unique email address? <comment17269> Not at all. I'll try to edit my answer to be more clear. Comment again if I still haven't hit the mark. <comment17271> I was wondering this myself, it doesn't make sense why you can call any account except your own when you have multiple devices attached to that account. <comment118668> This doesn't work on Mountain Lion as the call aborts as soon as you start to dial. Are you saying they should have two different Apple ID? <comment118669> Are you saying they should have two different Apple ID? <comment118731> Make sure you uncheck the first email after you add the second one.
