IOS users: How many characters is Facebook messenger notification preview <body> I know when someone messages you on Facebook messenger, you get a notification with a preview of the message but not the whole thing. On Android, the message has to be quite long for the preview to not show the whole message and force you open the message to see the whole thing.  What about IOS, any idea how big the message has to be before the preview stops showing the rest of the message?   This is to find out if a person I know has seen the whole message without actually being in messenger.
