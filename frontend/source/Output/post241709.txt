What kind of input Jack can work on a MacBook Pro (15-inch, Mid 2012) audio input port? <body> I was planning to buy a new mic for my MacBook Pro (15-inch, Mid 2012), but I tried connecting an old mic and nothing happened. The old mic is not broken, because I tested it on another PC and it worked.  I just want to know if I can connect the mic that I was planning to buy.  I was thinking of this microphone: http://www.amazon.com/Tonor-TN12326-Professional-Condenser-Microphone/dp/B00PZMP3Z0  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YS0k7.jpg" alt=""  <answer241712> Any line-level input should work with the 15-inch Mid 2012 MacBook Pro (the MBPr is slightly different.) Simply insert it into the audio in port on your MacBook Pro using a 3.5mm jack. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/L6FaK.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Line level simply refers to relatively amplified analog signal. Not all microphones provide this: if necessary, you may need to use an amplifier.  I'm not sure why the microphone you already have didn't work: there's nothing that should be preventing it. If you can provide more info, we might be able to help.  <comment297011> That microphone uses a 3.5mm audio jack, which your Mac has. It should fit. <comment348387> The mic probably is providing a mic level input,
