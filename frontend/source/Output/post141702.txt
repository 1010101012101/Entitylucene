Open a new Safari window in the current Space from Terminal with multiple tabs (URLs) <body> How to open an new Safari window from Terminal in the current Space?  Now when using the codeopen http://example.com/code command it opened the URL as last tab on my first Safari window.  I'm looking for a way to open:  ul liNew Safari window (regardless how many I have opened)./li liIn the current Space/li liFrom Terminal with the provided URL./li /ul  It probably will need some codeosascript/code script, but my AppleScript knowledge is nearly zero...  The bonus could be open two URLs, in two tabs, in a new window in the current Space.  Could anyone help?  <answer141716> Here is an AppleScript that should help you. Open AppleScript Editor and save this as a script. I have modified the source that I found here to support taking arguments on the command line.   Use it like this:  codeosascript new_window.scpt http://www.google.com http://www.stackoverflow.com/code  Of course, replace the URLs above with your own URLs.  hr  h2new_window.scpt/h2  precodeon run argv     tell application "Safari"         if (count argv) = 0 then             -- If you dont want to open a new window for an empty list, replace the             -- following line with just "return"             set {first_url, rest_urls} to {"", {}}         else             -- `item 1 of ...` gets the first item of a list, `rest of ...` gets             -- everything after the first item of a list.  We treat the two             -- differently because the first item must be placed in a new window, but             -- everything else must be placed in a new tab.             set {first_url, rest_urls} to {item 1 of argv, the rest of argv}         end if          make new document at end of documents with properties {URL:first_url}         tell window 1             repeat with the_url in rest_urls                 make new tab at end of tabs with properties {URL:the_url}             end repeat         end tell         activate     end tell end run /code/pre  hr  You could even create an alias for this in Terminal and be able to use it easier. I would add the following to code~/.bash_profile/code:  codealias newwindow='osascript /path/to/new_window.scpt'/code  Call codenewwindow/code whatever you want. Save code.bash_profile/code and restart Terminal for it to work.  hr  In case anyone is looking for a similar solution for Google Chrome, here is a different take on the same idea.  h2chrome_new_window.scpt/h2  precodeon run argv     tell application "Google Chrome"         if (count argv) = 0 then             make new window         else             tell (make new window)                 set URL of active tab to item 1 of argv                 repeat with the_url in the rest of argv                     open location the_url                 end repeat             end tell         end if         set active tab index of first window to 1         activate     end tell end run /code/pre  <answer141721> What about this answer by user markhunte.  You can place the below function with the osascript code in your code.profile/code.  code:  precodefunction Safari {   # Will open a New Safari window with argument 1.  osascript &lt;&lt;EOD tell application "Safari" to make new document with properties {URL:"$1"} return EOD  } /code/pre  In terminal:  codecd/code to your home directory.  Run:  precodenano .profile /code/pre  If you already have a code.profile/code file it will open and there will be some code there already.  Enter the code into it below any other code.  If you did not have one, a blank code.profile/code file will be opened.  Enter the code into it.  hr  After entering the code:  Hold down kbdCtrl/kbd and press the kbdx/kbd key.  At the bottom of the window you will be asked to save the changes.  Hit the kbdy/kbd key for yes.  You will now be asked to save it with the current name of code.profile/code.  Just hit the enter key to save it.  Run :  precode. ~/.profile /code/pre  This will update the environment.  now you can run:  Safari  "http://stackoverflow.com" Note the Cap "S" in Safari.  <comment167009> ABSOLUTELY marvelous. I simple created a script called Safari in my `$PATH` with a shebang `#!/usr/bin/osascript` and works like a charm. Thank you! <comment167011> Thank you too, I more like `vim` for editing. ;) Accepting aglasser's answer because solved the two url problem. <comment167073> Didn't know you could do that with `#!/usr/bin/osascript`! Glad to help (and thanks for the new knowledge!)
