Display resolution options disappeared after upgrade to Sierra <body> After I upgraded an MBPr to 10.12 Sierra, the 4k external display connected to it shows significantly less options under Display  Resolution  Scaled (pressing Option to see the resolutions). Before, I always used it at resolutions between 2160p and 1080p, generally 1440p, but those are gone now.img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/imEOK.png" alt="Preferences window showing display resolutions, including 2160p and 1080p but nothing in between"  What could cause this? How would you troubleshoot it? I'd rather fix it without having to force the resolution in configuration files (like I had to do years ago), but that'd be better than this situation.  Thanks!  <answer255148> One possible solution I found in a MacRumors thread is listed below. Note I have not tested this myself as I do not have either Sierra or a monitor that would support such a resolution.     This command in Terminal and a reboot fixed it for me on Sierra.  precodesudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.windowserver.plist DisplayResolutionEnabled -bool true /code/pre   Also try checking the "Show low resolution modes" option.  <answer283251> I purchase a new MacPro (the little black trash can) and shortly after, chose to install the Sierra update. Upon restart, it would not recognize my Apple Cinema's high res settings. After 3 hours with Apple tech support, they filed a report to Apple engineering who solved my problem with this solution:  ul liShut down your machine/li liUnplug all of your monitor's connections (in my case, 2 USB and 1 Thunderbolt) and reconnect using only the ports on the RIGHT side of the Mac./li liVoila! They said they are aware of the glitch, are attempting to fix it, and until now, this should work./li /ul  <comment317629> This is a problem in Sierra, and many people are having this problem. <comment360017> the question refered to a MBP, and this answer is only relevant to a MacPro, but still will be useful for someone. BTW, what a bug...
