WS.Malware in Chrome, how to remove it? <body> I got WS.Malware on my Chrome since yesterday. I installed MalwareBytes but it could not detect it. It opens random phishing pages.  How do I get rid of it?  It is happening only on Chrome. I reinstalled it, it worked for a few hours but same again  It was a URL which had codews.malware/code something like that present, I googled and found the name of malware.  <comment374112> Tell in your OQ how you detected WS malware, and which version. <comment374133> The question is updated. <comment374135> Which macOS version and Chrome version are you using? <comment374137> I am on El Capitan and 60.0.3112.101 (Official Build) (64-bit) for Chrome
