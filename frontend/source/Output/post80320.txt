Can I use Logitech ultrathin wireless keyboard for iPad also with my MacBook? <body> This is the product, and it links to your iPad with Bluetooth: http://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/ultrathin-keyboard-cover  The question is whether one could also use it with other Mac devices such as MacBook.   <answer80324> I think you can actually use it - I have it and used it at home before with different Apple devices.
