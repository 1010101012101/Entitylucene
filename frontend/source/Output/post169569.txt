How to move windows on Mac as in windows from keyboard? <body> I'm an ex windows user and I loved to move windows clicking on the windows logo button and using arrows.  Is there something similar on Mac?  <answer169571> As far as I know, you can't do it without external software like SizeUp, Divvy, Moom... and many others.   There is no keyboard shortcuts for moving windows: http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201236  <answer169572> You can use strongBetter Touch Tool/strong app to assign keyboard shortcuts to move windows similar to Windows style.
