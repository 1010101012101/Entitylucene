Where is system/library/extensions in OSX 10.10? <body> so I am now using vmware player to mount the osx now, and since I accidentally installed the svga display driver with the vmware tool one from darwin now I cant change the resolution of it so I need to uninstall the svga. I try to find system/library/extensions so that I can uninstall the svga driver but I cant find it in the library. Where can I find it or it is just hidden in the library folder?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uQb3S.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer159969> âŒ˜-Shift-G is the hotkey for the "Go to Folder" dropdown menu. Just type in /System/Library/Extensions and click Go to open that folder.  P.S. I think your screenshot may be in your User folder, not the System folder. The System folder lives in Macintosh HD, not within a specific user's files.  <comment188052> thanks and it works! So one more question about how it works on mac, so basically if I delete the file in extension the extension will disappear and that is equal to uninstall in mac right? <comment188053> yes I think you are right, I type ~/Library to take that screenshot and I thought that is the same as system library. <comment188054> If the extension came from VMWare, you may want to search around for a VMWare-approved uninstall method first. If a display driver suddenly disappears, I wouldn't trust the VM to not freeze up on the spot. If you really can't find an alternative method, then take a backup of your VM first (just in case) and then see what deleting the extension does.
