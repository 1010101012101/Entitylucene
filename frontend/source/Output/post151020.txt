How do I prepare a new device in Configurator without updating the device iOS? <body> I need to install an in-house application on a few company ipods. In order to get  them into supervised mode I need to use the Perpare function of Apple Configurator. However, I cannot unselect the 'Update iOS' option, and the app to be installed is iOS7 only.  <answer151719> Place the required version iOS ipsw file here:  ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.configurator/Data/Library/Caches/com.apple.configurator/Firmware/  Use the Edit Custom iOS Versions command In Apple Configurator, hold down the Option key while choosing Devices  Edit Custom iOS Versions. You can then add or remove custom versions of iOS software, such as developer previews.  source: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT200241?viewlocale=en_US
