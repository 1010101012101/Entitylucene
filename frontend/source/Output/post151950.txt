Apple Script not running as expected <body> The following is an applescript which is meant to take the body of the latest email and extract text out of it. As you can see the result is shown below. This result is show as the script was running correctly before. Now it is not.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QAZ6y.png" alt="The following is an applescript which is meant to take the body of the latest email and extract text out of it.

The email I sent later on contained the message "#tech sxi" but the script is not showing the correct output for this email. This is not the only one. Every time, I am sending a new mail and running the script again, i get the same problem, the result just does not change.   <answer227109> As one of the commenters alluded to, "get first message of inbox" probably won't return what you expect.  When retrieving messages using AppleScript, Mail sorts your mailbox accounts emalphabetically/em.  Within each account's inbox, messages are sorted newest first.  What you have selected in Mail doesn't change the order in which they're returned to AppleScript.  So if you have the following accounts and inbox messages appearing in Mail in this order:  ul liMy iCloud  ul liMessage dated 1/5/16/li liMessage dated 1/10/16/li /ul/li liMy Gmail  ul liMessage dated 1/10/16/li liMessage dated 1/5/16/li /ul/li /ul  "get first message of inbox" will return the Message dated 1/5/16 from the "My Gmail" account (G comes before i, 1/5/16 comes before 1/10/16).  My guess is that you have more than one account in Mail.  ul liName the specific mailbox.  This will always set theMessage to the newest message in "My Gmail".  (The account name is the same name you see in Mail in the list under Inbox).  precodeset theMessage to first message in mailbox "INBOX" of account "My Gmail" /code/pre/li /ul  This is an unusual approach, however, as mail moves, so the first message in your mailbox could become your second message unexpectedly.  Here are a couple of reliable ways to extract data from messages:  ul liUse strongselected messages/strong (messages you've selected by clicking on them in Mail):  precodetell application "Mail"     set theMessages to selection      -- This block extracts the topics from the messages     repeat with theMessage in theMessages         set theMessageText to content of theMessage         try             -- Set topic to the string starting just after the hash             set topic to rich text ((offset of "#" in theMessageText) + 1) thru end of theMessageText             -- Truncate the topic at the first space             set topic to rich text 1 thru ((offset of " " in topic) - 1) of topic         on error             -- No topic found in message             set topic to ""         end try         log topic      end repeat end tell /code/pre/li listrongMail Rules/strong (run a script on messages that match certain criteria).  In Mail, open Preferences  Rules.  Create a new rule with "Run AppleScript" as the action.  Select "Open in Finder" from the menu that lets you select which script to run.  Open Script Editor, and save the code below as a script in the folder Mail opened.  Back in Mail, select your saved script as the script to run:  precodeusing terms from application "Mail"     on perform mail action with messages theMessages for rule thisRule         -- This block extracts the topics from the messages         repeat with theMessage in theMessages             set theMessageText to content of theMessage             try                 -- Set topic to the string starting just after the hash                 set topic to rich text ((offset of "#" in theMessageText) + 1) thru end of theMessageText                 -- Truncate the topic at the first space                 set topic to rich text 1 thru ((offset of " " in topic) - 1) of topic             on error                 -- No topic found in message                 set topic to ""             end try             log topic         end repeat      end perform mail action with messages end using terms from /code/pre/li /ul  <comment180405> If you run the code in Applescript Editor do you get the same result? Try breaking down your code in the editor and see the results you get. Especially check the mail body content returned. Are the messages plain text, html or rich text? <comment185220> Are you sure that the first message of inbox is the newest? You say that you get the same result every time your script runs what looks like the first item does not change between runs! Maybe you can use a `tell application "Mail" to open (get first message of inbox)` to have a look which message is the first message!
