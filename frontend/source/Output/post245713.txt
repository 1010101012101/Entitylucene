Repeated alerts after a missed call on an Iphone <body> How can I get repeated alerts after a missed call on an iPhone SE?  I am looking for some way to blink the strongLED flash/strong and strongvibrate/strong, periodically after a call has been missed.   This periodic blinking and vibrating should continue infinitely, until I dismiss the alert.  The notification needs to be noticeable even when the phone is lying on the desk, and the screen is hidden by the flip case, so an on-screen popup is insufficient.  Decreased battery life is not a concern for me in this case. Optionally, this notification could be limited to times when the phone is connected to a charger.  Which setting or app would allow me to do this with an iPhone SE?  Something that works on an un-jailbroken phone would be greatly preferred.  hr  emWhat I found so far:/em  There is a setting for repeating message notifications, limited to at most 20 minutes after a missed message, but for some reason I was unable to find such a setting for repeating call notifications.  I also found a setting to blink the LED flash when the phone rings, but this only works for the exact moment the phone rings, it is not repeated at a later time.
