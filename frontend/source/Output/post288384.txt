What's the easiest way to share a file between devices, when using Hotspot? <body> AirDrop seems to work smoothly as long my iPhone's Bluetooth is enabled. The MacBook can send/receive files. That doesn't even require internet connection.  I found it very difficult, tho, to transfer a file, while my MacBook uses the iPhone's Hotspot.  What is the easiest/fastest way to share a file from my iPhone to my MacBook when the iPhone Hotspot is enabled?  Currently I'm sharing the files via email, sending emails to myself from my iPhone and downloading the files on my mac once the email arrives.  For big files that could not be very smooth. And it's not smooth anyways because I have to way for upload/download.  Is there a faster way? Such as sending via bluetooth somehow...
