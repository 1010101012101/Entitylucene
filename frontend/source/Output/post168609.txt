Sort files by name length in finder? <body> I want to be able to find all mp3 files with exactly 4 letters so i can highlight them and open them up in ITunes. How do I do this?  I recently copied mp3s from my iPod to my mac. These files are all labelled with 4 random letters (eg. WRXL) and only reveal the name of the artist and song once opened in iTunes. When I highlighted all the files and double clicked and most of them opened up iTunes and became properly labelled, however i am left with about 2000 songs with the weird labels. These files are scattered through different albums and artists, so i need to find a way to group them all together so i can open them at the same time.   Thanks for the help!  <answer168619> I'd just use the Recently Added smartlist &amp; sort by date added.   You can't search by '4 random characters'.  <answer168627> You can make it from strongTerminal.app/strong. Open Terminal, navigate to the folder where Your music is (here's example for iTunes library):  precodecd ~/Music/iTunes/iTunes\ Media/Music/ /code/pre  Then run this command:  precodefind . -name "[[:alpha:]][[:alpha:]][[:alpha:]][[:alpha:]].mp3" -exec open {} \;" /code/pre  This will find all 4 letters mp3 files, for example codeXXXX.mp3/code and open them in default app.   hr  supPattern in the codefind/code command could be shortened, but I can't find it right now./sup
