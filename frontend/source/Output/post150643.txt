Can't re-install homebrew <body> I'm having a problem re-installing homebrew. I am running Mavericks  It started with me trying to install express.js. Homebrew had been installed on my mac for quite some time, never had any trouble with it. I used codesudo npm install -g express/code, but when I ran codeexpress --version/code, I got command not found. Eventually, I found a possible solution online, and just tried to reinstall npm with codebrew remove npm/code and codebrew install npm/code. Again, I ran into errors (Unfortunately, I didn't save the exact errors) I used codebrew doctor/code to try and figure it out, looked up a ton of tutorials and mucked around with homebrew, and I guess I broke something.  Now, I figure I should just try and reinstall homebrew.   I run the install command for homebrew:  coderuby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"/code  It returns this message:  codeIt appears Homebrew is already installed. If your intent is to reinstall you should do the following before running this installer again:     rm -rf /usr/local/Cellar /usr/local/.git &amp;&amp; brew cleanup/code  So, I run   coderm -rf /usr/local/Cellar /usr/local/.git &amp;&amp; brew cleanup/code  This returns:  code-bash: brew: command not found/code  I try running the install command again, and this time, it doesn't tell me homebrew is already installed.  So again, I run the install command for homebrew:  coderuby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"/code  And now I get this:  code==&gt; This script will install: /usr/local/bin/brew /usr/local/Library/... /usr/local/share/man/man1/brew.1/code  codePress RETURN to continue or any other key to abort ==&gt; /usr/bin/sudo /bin/chmod g+rwx /Library/Caches/Homebrew Password: ==&gt; Downloading and installing Homebrew... remote: Counting objects: 136, done. remote: Total 136 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0) Receiving objects: 100% (136/136), 10.37 MiB | 1.53 MiB/s, done.

And why is the brew installer referring to a repository I used as a test for a little web project? (right above Installation succesful!)  <answer150651> Short term answer, try this command to see if your brew installation worked:  precode/usr/local/bin/brew doctor /code/pre  It seems that your bash environment may not be looking in the /usr/local/bin for executibles (which means you have to write the full path rather than just the name of the command). The solution may be just resourcing your conf files, which can be roughly done by closing your terminal and opening a new one. Otherwise, you'll want to add a line to your ~/.bash_profile. I think resourcing will do the trick though.  So after confirming the success with the first doctor, try quitting your terminal application and starting fresh, then your original usage of brew should work. If it doesn't try:  precodeecho $PATH /code/pre  and report  back the results.  <comment177307> What does the command `which brew` output on your Mac after you run the cleanup command of "`rm -rf /usr/local/Cellar /usr/local/.git && brew cleanup`"? <comment177510> Unfortunately, `/usr/local/bin/brew doctor` doesn't seem to help. It just returns:         `-bash: /usr/local/bin/brew: No such file or directory`.      echo $PATH gives me this output:                          `/Users/Sven/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.1.2/bin:/Users/Sven/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.1.2@global/bin:/Users/Sven/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.1.2/bin:/usr/local/bin:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:/opt/X11/bin:/usr/local/git/bin:/usr/texbin:/opt/local/bin:/usr/local/mysql/bin:/Users/Sven/.rvm/bin` <comment177511> `-bash: brew: command not found`
