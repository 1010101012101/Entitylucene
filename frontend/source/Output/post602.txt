How Can I Search A Specific Type of File in Mac? <body> Is there any way to search a specific type of file using Spotlight? I remember there was a special command or something that I had to put in front of the search phrase but I cannot remember it now.   For example, if I want to search only PDFs for a particular phrase in Spotlight, what would I do?  <answer603> ol liOpen a Find Window (cmd-f) or do a spotlight search and select "show all"/li liHit the little "+" icon (to the right of the 'save' button)/li liSelect File Type as a search criteria and select the correct one./li liRerun the search./li /ol  (Disclaimer, I'm not on a Mac right now :( so my exact instructions might be a little off).  <answer604> Search by Kind One of the most useful ways to narrow down a search is by using the codekind:/code keyword. This allows you to restrict your list of results to a certain file format. For instance, if you type codetime machine kind:pdf/code, Spotlight will pull up only PDF files containing the words "time" and "machine". You can also limit your search to e-mail messages, music files, System Preferences, applications, and more.  While the original Spotlight recognized only a limited number of file types, the Leopard version can look for files created by specific applications, as well as certain file formats. Searching for codekind:mp3/code or codekind:tiff/code will find files in one of those formats, and searching for codekind:pages/code or codekind:powerpoint/code will show only documents created in one of those programs. For a list of useful keywords, see “My Kind of Keyword.” But remember, for the keywords to work, you must have the appropriate categories enabled in Spotlight’s preferences.  you can get more info here or here.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tpYOw.png" alt="alt text"  <answer1449> It's already been answered, but here's my 2 cents.   Via Bash through the terminal  codefind ~ -type f -name '*pdf'/code or codefind ~ -iname '*pdf'/code  (or, if you want to ignore error messages, codefind ~ -type f -name '*pdf' 2&gt;/dev/null/code)  or you can use this to search for a string in a file:  codefind ~ -iname '*txt' | xargs grep 'string you want'/code  This may not return anything on a pdf, but it will work on most other file types (text, php, py, html, etc).  <answer4194> precodemdimport -A  /code/pre  will give you every possible attribute available on your system  kMDItemKind is the attribute for files, but perhaps the above will suggest a better attribute to search on.   Then   precodemdfind "kMDItemKind == 'whatever'" /code/pre  The syntax might make you shout out in disgust.  I can personally attest that it ruins zsh completion.  Still, Spotlight ( that's what this is ) indexes your stuff all the time anyway, and it's fast.  Might as well use it.  YMMV  <answer69220> The question "How to use Regex with spotlight" is marked as a duplicate of this for some reason, so I thought I would share how to do wildcard searching.  You can do wildcard searching in the Finder using a Kind of "Raw Query" with the kMDItemDisplayName attribute: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lqJdK.png" alt="Raw Query example"  Raw Queries are essentially what you use with the mdfind command. I have more details on Raw Queries and using them in the GUI at https://superuser.com/a/491119/66255.  <answer168424> It's not possible via spotlight (at least on Yosemite). You can only use finder.  ol liStart a search with Command+F./li liClick on the '+' icon on the far side of the taskbar/li liSelect the type from the 'kind' pull-down menu. Select 'other' and then find 'File extension'/li /ol  Enter your desired file extension and hit enter  <comment596> Ah, yes! This was the command that I needed! Thank you very much. :) <comment1249> This is so AWESOME. I didn't know you could do this. Thanks very much. <comment1250> it's like grep :) <comment1314> You should be more clear that this answer was copied and pasted from [Macworld.com](http://www.macworld.com/article/132788/2008/04/spotlight2.html). <comment217159> Great answer! I never knew this till today! <comment218464> this works really well and is fast. <comment284823> It helps to add /dev/null: `find / -iname '*mp4' 2/dev/null`  `find / -iname '*mp3' 2/dev/null`
