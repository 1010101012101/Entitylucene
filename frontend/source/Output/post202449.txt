iCloud music library won't load on new phone <body> I got a new phone today, have  enabled Apple Music and iCloud library, but every time it goes to "load library" it just stops and goes to a screen that says I have no music.  This happens whether I toggle iCloud music on and off several times, merge or replace.  I'm on wifi trying to do this btw.  <answer202762> Try logging out from iCloud and logging back in. Sometimes Apple Music has issues detecting the Music account.  <comment249832> I've got the some problem... Haven't found a solution yet...
