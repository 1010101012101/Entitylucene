Opening iBooks PDFs with Other Apps on iPhone <body> I have several PDF files in iBooks. I want to open them with the "PDF reader" App instead.  How do I do this?  <answer285198> Solution for MacOS (the question originally didn't specify OS)  To do this, just open the folder which contains your iBooks, right click on a particular book, go to "open with", and choose the program you want (say pdf reader).   This post describes where the iBooks folder is located in Sierra.   It should look something like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IWw0Z.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  Edit:  The OP has now specified that the problem is specific to  iOS. Doing this directly is strongimpossible/strong due to the way that the iOS manages storage. iOS doesn't have a file system in the way that macOS does. Each file is associated with the operating  system or a particular app. According to this website for iOS developers     For security purposes, an iOS app’s interactions with the file system are limited to the directories inside the app’s sandbox directory   This means app A can't just go into app B's storage and read a file (say a PDF document).  Thus, you need a workaround. Personally, I use google drive to sync my books (wirelessly) between my mac and my iPhone/tablets. While you could probably do something like this with iCloud I haven't tried that yet so I'll give my solution. All you have to do is  ol liSign up for a google account if you don't have one already/li liDownload the Google Drive macOS app/li liMake a folder  emF/em of all your books (iBooks already did this (see my unedited answer)). Then you have 2 choices:/li liChoice 1 (ADVANCED): "Hard link" folder emF/em to your Google Drive folder. This will update your google drive automatically every time emF/em is edited, say every time you add a new book to emF/em. The way to do this is discussed in this question. You will need knowledge of the command line. /li liChoice 2 (SIMPLE): Manually copy emF/em into your google drive folder. (Note that you can also drag emF/em into the google drive folder. strongHOWEVER if you do this once emF/em is uploaded, emF/em will be stored in the (google drive) cloud, and no longer on your computer/strong.)/li liDownload the google drive app on your phone (or tablet or android) and sign in./li liYou can now see the folder emF/em on your iphone and any other ios (or Android!!!!!) devices on which you have installed the app. /li liIf you have a wifi connection, you can just click on a PDF to open it. If you want to make it so that in the future you can open PDFs without a wifi connection, just follow these instructions./li /ol  Here's a screenshot of how it should look.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sZ3pi.png" alt="googledrive"  <answer285269> Another method, simpler, not involving clouds is as follows:  ol liTouch and hold on book's icon in iBooks, and, from pop-up menu choose "Print", see figure below:/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BMHyW.png" alt="enter image description here"  ol start="2" liOn the preview page, do inverse pinch (two fingers spread): img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uh3z4.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liNow, from Printer options, lower left corner, touch the square to send to other applications: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/n1Vbb.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liAnd choose where to send a copy - in this example I used Documents application img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gTzrQ.png" alt="enter image description here"/li /ol
