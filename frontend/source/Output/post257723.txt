Screensharing App chops the view and displays it out of order <body> When I connect to a new MacMini running Sierra, my Macbook's (running Sierra) screen-sharing app fails to show the screen correctly. It appears the screen has been cut and placed out of out of order. You can see what I mean by looking at the menu bar. The mouse hovering over the Apple Logo is the MacMini's mouse.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hYEiJ.png" alt="enter image description here"  ol liI can't type or use the mouse. I eventually have to physically connect a KVM to the Mac Mini to use it. I do not have access to another mac to see if it is isolated to this one connection./li liAdditionally, I have to keep switching from emAdaptive Quality/em to emFull Quality/em just to get the view to show up. Unless I move my house over the screen, in which case it reveals the refreshed screen in squares. /li liBoth Machines are Up-to-Date on software. The MacMini is brand new     with a fresh install of Sierra./li liPlugging up the KVM, the monitor shows the correct view./li /ol  I have tried Googling the issue, but don't know exactly how to describe it, so I get unrelated results.
