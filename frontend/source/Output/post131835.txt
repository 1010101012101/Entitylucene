How do I create an easily accessible directory outside of /Users/<my username>? <body> I want to sync/backup my entire Home (/Users/) directory to other computers using Bittorrent Sync.  Right now my Home directory contains my DropBox folder, which (at 17GB) I do not want to be part of this sync/backup.  I thought an easy way to do this would be to create a Dropbox directory at the /Users level, but even after I set the permissions of that directory to 777, the Dropbox app won't let me move Dropbox there.  I understand that an alternative is to exclude just the Dropbox directory from the Bittorrent Sync (I assume that's possible - I haven't tried it yet), but I think it would be cleaner to have an easily accessible but separate (outside my Home) directory. Is there any way to do this?  <answer131838> I changed my Dropbox directory to /links/Dropbox with no problems the Dropbox app created a subdirectory Dropbox there. I created this directory with New Folder from the Finder  precodelinks mark$ ls -l total 0 drwxr-xr-x   3 mark      admin  102 25 May 17:18 Dropbox drwxrwxrwx   3 mark      admin  102 30 Nov 20:10 V drwxr-xr-x   5 mark      admin  170 30 Nov 20:32 VirtualMachines /code/pre  and  precodelinks mark$ ls -l Dropbox/ total 0 drwx------@ 24 mark  staff  816 25 May 17:18 Dropbox /code/pre  <comment154924> What error does the Dropbox app give? <comment154926> It's not about an error - it's that I don't want to be syncing my 17GB Dropbox data (which is already synced to all my different computers via Dropbox) AGAIN via BitTorrent Sync.  It's a waste of data and/or a potential sync cluster**** if BT Sync and DropBox are both trying to sync the same folder. <comment154927> I was asking re " the Dropbox app won't let me move Dropbox there." <comment154928> I did find that adding "/Dropbox*" to the .SyncIgnore files on BOTH sides (Mac side and linux side) keeps the Dropbox folder from being synced by BT Sync.  So that's 99% of what I want.  I'm still curious if there's a way to set up a folder on the Mac's primary drive with normal user permissions outside of the user's Home folder, so I'm leaving the question open. <comment154929> Ahh...Dropbox error was "Error with selected folder / Can't create a Dropbox folder in the requested location".  That's all she wrote...  I tried it both with no DropBox folder (so the app could create it) and with an existing Dropbox folder with 777 permission.  Same error in both cases... <comment154945> Where/what is the "/links" directory?  When I "cd /links", I get "cd: /links: No such file or directory"... <comment154951> That is just a directory I have for all non standard directories (named when I had much smaller disks and so had to link across file systems) - It just shows Dropbox can use other directories <comment154958> Well that was my basic problem - I didn't know how or where to create a directory in OSX that's not under my user directory that other programs like DropBox could use (I was trying to use Finder, which was a mistake, at least until I discovered Command-^).  I did some more digging and figured out how to create a new directory at the root level of my harddisk, changed the permissions, and Dropbox is now happy.
