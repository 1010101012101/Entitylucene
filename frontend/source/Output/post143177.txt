Macports installer public signing key <body> The MacPorts installation guide says:     ol   liDownload the latest MacPorts-2.3.1-....pkg installer from the MacPorts download directory. [...]/li   liDouble-click the downloaded package installer to perform the default “easy” install./li   /ol   In between steps 1 and 2, however, a user may wish to verify the integrity of the downloaded package, using the PGP signature file also found in the Macports download directory.  If SIGNATURE_FILE is the name of the signature file, I get the following result:  precode$ gpg --verify SIGNATURE_FILE gpg: Signature made Thu 26 Jun 00:37:12 2014 BST using DSA key ID B4AAE6CD gpg: Can't check signature: public key not found /code/pre  Where can I find the public key? Google doesn't seem to know.  <answer143181> The key ID is B4AAE6CD, from your command output. You need to search and retrieve the key from a keyserver:   precodegpg --recv-keys B4AAE6CD /code/pre  Then your verify command should work.  <comment168683> Please check the address of the keyserver, seems to be wrong. <comment168687> @Michael, thanks. Using `gpg --recv-keys --keyserver wwwkeys.pgp.net B4AAE6CD` as you suggested produces `gpgkeys: key B4AAE6CD not found on keyserver` `gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found.` On the plus side, `$ gpg --recv-keys B4AAE6CD` yields a key that can be used to check the integrity of the downloaded file, so I've edited your answer accordingly in order to be able to mark it "accepted". <comment168688> (Using that key to verify the signature produces a warning message: `WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!` `There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.` However, this is correct GnuPG behaviour, as explained [here](https://www.torproject.org/docs/verifying-signatures.html.en) and [here](https://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual/x334.html).) <comment168727> It is actually in the original keyserver I posted if you look at the web interface. (all the public ones synchronize with each other) It worked when I tried yesterday. They may be having issues as I can't even connect to it now. Since most gpg installs come with a default keyserver set, it's not strictly necessary to specify one anyways, so thanks for fixing it.
