Find the path to my USB webcam on OS X Mavericks <body> I am trying to live stream my webcam (with ffmpeg) on a web server using Web sockets. However, I cannot manage to find the path (similar to /dev/video* un Linux).  I wanted first to use iSight, but Apple makes it really complex to access it (using avfoundation, qkit).  How can I identify/access my Webcam device please ?  strongNote :/strong I have found this post, but sadly unanswered.  Thanks  <answer135189> You should try the VLC player.  It has multitude of options for setting of the Capture and Streaming.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/J2wxU.jpg" alt="capture"  I am not showing your set up since I do not have external webcam, but it should show in the drop down menu for you.  <comment160192> does your Mac actually recognizes the external device connect to USB ? <comment160193> Yes I am able to use the usb webcam when opening Photo booth or Skype
