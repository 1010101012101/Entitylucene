Apple Shortcut Icon <body> I'm pretty sure this is the best site for the this question, if not please feel free to point in a different direction,  I am using the Mac version of Eclipse and I'm stumped as to what the Keyboard Shortcut for "Run as.." is.  The image looks like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/q7oEK.png" alt="enter image description here"  I recognize the COMMAND key and the OPTION key, but whats the X key?  Thanks!  <answer11630> That's the kbdX/kbd on your keyboard.  In Eclipse you have to press the kbd⌥/kbd kbd⌘/kbd kbdX/kbd simultaneously and then release all of them and press kbdJ/kbd.  <answer11632> You hold down kbd⌥/kbd+kbd⌘/kbd simultaneously, then you press the kbdX/kbd which open a small yellow popup like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/z2CG8.png" alt="enter image description here"  where you then press kbdJ/kbd - and after that you release kbd⌥/kbd+kbd⌘/kbd.  <comment12174> Brilliant! a bit tricky at first, but I'll get use to it, this should save me lots of time, cheers! :)
