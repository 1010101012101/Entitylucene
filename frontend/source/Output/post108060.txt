How to prevent Command-I/Command-Shift-I from opening Mac Mail when in browser? <body> When in a browser (Chrome or Safari), the following keyboard shortcut will always bring up a window that says em"Welcome To Mail"/em:  kbdCommand/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbdI/kbd  I would like to use this shortcut for another purpose.  Is there any way to disable this shortcut?  <answer108129> You can change the shortcuts from System Preferences:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Re45F.png" alt=""  If you want to disable the shortcuts, edit the NSUserKeyEquivalents dictionaries directly:  precodedefaults write com.google.Chrome NSUserKeyEquivalents -dict-add 'Email Page Location' '\0' defaults write com.google.Chrome.canary NSUserKeyEquivalents -dict-add 'Email Page Location' '\0' defaults write com.apple.Safari NSUserKeyEquivalents -dict-add 'Email Link to This Page' '\0' 'Email This Page' '\0' /code/pre  Then quit and reopen Chrome and Safari to apply the changes.  <answer148723> The command-line solution given in another answer eventually worked for me but I needed to do one more thing:  after codedefaults write com.google.Chrome NSUserKeyEquivalents -dict-add 'Email Page Location' '\0'/code,  I entered the command:  codekillall cfprefsd/code (and codekillall Finder/code for good measure).   This stopped the annoying kbdCmd/kbd-kbdShift/kbd-kbdI/kbd shortcut on Chrome from creating a new mail message, but I can't get it to stop happening in Safari, unfortunately.  codekillall cfprefsd/code clears the preferences cachebr codekillall Finder/code restarts the Finder  The GUI method described at the top didn't work at all for me, but maybe because I didn't clear the prefs cache.  <answer148927> Taking a look at Chrome's keyboard shortcuts helps.  kbdCmnd/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbdI/kbd is to "Email the current page". It's a bit annoying because it's so close to the developer tools (kbdCmnd/kbd+kbdOpt/kbd+kbdI/kbd).  <answer286856> Unfortunately strongnone/strong of the answers given here were able to prevent kbdCommand/kbd+kbdI/kbd from triggering Email This Page in emSafari/em for me (running macOS Sierra). The emonly/em way I have been able to prevent that behavior is by using FastScripts to map kbdCommand/kbd+kbdI/kbd to an empty AppleScript. The script must be stored in code~/Library/Scripts/Applications/Safari/code to prevent it from disabling use of the shortcut for italics in other applications.  Unfortunately this approach has the side effect of disabling the use of kbdCommand/kbd+kbdI/kbd to toggle italics in Safari where that is its default behavior, such as in Google Docs or in this answer box on AskDifferent. For me that's worth avoiding being thrown into my email inbox whenever I try to italicize text in a text box in Safari that doesn't support it.  <answer295360> The accepted answer is not working on my MacBook Pro with macOS Sierra system.  I found a solution to disable kbdCommand/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbdi/kbd in Chrome:  ol liInstall the Chrome extension Shortkeys./li liOpen the Shortkeys's preference panel, add a codecommand+shift+i/code shortcut like below:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hns0A.png" alt="Shortkeys for Chrome screenshot"/li liRestart Chrome./li /ol  Now you can say goodbye to the annoying Mac Mail!  <comment126719> Does this only happen in Safari or also in other application? <comment126721> Ah, good question!  I assumed it was global, but it only happens in Safari (or Chrome).  And actually, I was using Chrome. <comment234289> It's got even worse now. They've changed it in Yosemite to ⌘-I, when it used to work as a setting for forcing in-text type as _italics_ when supported. It's the most inane shortcut ever. Who the hell needs to frequently email links to people? And whoever those annoying people are _(i.e. my family members)_, I wish they would stop! <comment314918> As of El Capitan, I no longer see anything but "All Applications - Show Help menu" in that dialog. <comment314919> This worked in El Capitan! <comment319058> In El Capitan, you have to hit the + button at the bottom, then in the dialog box that pops up, select Google Chrome from the Application dropdown. Fill in the Menu Title and Keyboard Shortcut as the screen shot above shows. Despite my comment below, this GUI method works for me again in El Capitan, but I'm still unable to disable this shortcut in Safari. <comment362082> Ideally the AppleScript could detect when ⌘I would cause italic behavior and somehow "forward" the shortcut in that case. I don't have time to figure out how that would work at the moment but I'd welcome any comments on how this might be achieved! <comment370793> this doesn't work in *macOS Sierra 10.12.5* and its really annoying.
