How to change OSX System (Default) Shortcuts? <body> In OSX em(now is Mavericks)/em, how to change the strongSystem Default/strong Shortcuts, for example which are currently like:  ul licodeCommand + Shift + Q/code .. for current strongUser Logout/strong./li licodeCommand + Q/code .. for current (active) strongApplication Quit/strong./li licodeCommand + Down Arrow/code .. for strongOpening A File/strong./li /ul  Blah blah .. I don't like any of those, honestly.  ul liHow to permanently change them, please?/li /ul  em(I would even PAY for an App if it the only way to do.)/embr / Thanks!  <answer119482> This is pretty easy. I already answered a similar question for someone who wanted to redefine kbdCommand-V/kbd here.  Basically you need to go into System Preferences  Keyboard  Shortcuts and define a new shortcut under "All Apps". If you don't want to change it to something useful you will have to define a shortcut you will never use such as kbdShift-Command-Option-1/kbd.  If you want to get rid of strongall/strong the shortcuts then I suggest codeKeyRemap4MacBook/code and spend some time understanding how to write a private.xml config file for it. You might also want to grab a copy of codeKey Codes/code so you can figure out which keys push out which keycodes and modifiers.  It's certainly possible to map the "Log Out â€¦" as kbdShift-Command-Q/kbd out of the way. You just enter it into Shortcuts with the name and the ellipsis and the shortcut no longer works. kbdCommand-Q/kbd is impossible with the shortcut method but it was the only one I could find.  (I also wouldn't be rude and peremptory to people who were trying to help me but that could just be me.)  <answer261892> Go into System Preferences  Keyboard  Shortcuts, select Accessibility on left Pane and check "Invert colors" shortcut. Initially it's disabled.   Modify it to command+Q so from now this shortcut will not close anymore apps, it will just invert colors. It's an easy way to get rid of the habit to hit command+Q.   <comment139337> Do you mind leaving the old shortcuts active? <comment139338> omg dear, `changing` means i do not want the current ones to be functioning (or) do not want to use :S <comment139347> I see the point of @grgarside's question. Changing (ALSO enabling _let's say_ alt-k for copy, formerly cmd-c) may not mean replacing (cmd-c then doing nothing). Could you clarify the question? <comment139369> Thank you but NOT usable for All System-wide Shortcuts. What about `Command + Shift + Q` .. for current User Logout. And, `Command + Q` .. for quitting current active application. <comment139370> Thanks but I think i used `How to change` in the title of my question :(
