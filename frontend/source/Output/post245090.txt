Will Bluetooth speakers and/or USB speakers work for sound when there is a broken headphone jack stuck in my macbook port? <body> I bought a Macbook for a low price because it has a headphone jack broken off in its port. I have tried some of the fixes for removing the jack, but it is broken deep in the port and unfortunately didn't come out in one clean piece. I would really like to be able to have some sort of audio, and I'm willing to buy Bluetooth speakers or speakers that plug into the USB, but first I want to know whether they will override the headphone port.   Also, the volume control on the menu is greyed out so I can't control volume. I have read that you can fix that by removing and reinserting your headphone jack, but I obviously can't do that here.   Does anyone know whether that will prevent me from using other speakers?

In System Preferences  Sound, you can setup which audio device does what.  For example, in my setup, I play all the "Sound Effects" through the Internal Speakers, however, I could select the USB Audio device I also have installed.  For your case, you would select either the USB/Bluetooth Device.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fK8gRl.png" alt="enter image description here"  You could even use both a Bluetooth audio device strongemand/em/strong a USB device  For example, in my Output configuration, I can choose Internal, USB Audio, or Bluetooth  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gTPzVl.png" alt="enter image description here"  And...  Depending on your Application, it can even select which audio device to use for it's individual output.  Here's the configuration screen from VOX:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KiTtWm.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment302091> Can you please post a screen shot of your System Preferences  Sounds  Output area? <comment302329> I added 2 because I wasn't sure which one you meant. Does that help? <comment302350> I would not say override but just that you can choose it
