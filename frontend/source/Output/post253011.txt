WiFi connected to Macbook, no web browers load. Browsers load with ethernet. No other devices affected <body> My Macbook (OSX Lion 10.7.5) has decided to stop loading web browsers when connected to the WiFi in my apartment. It works fine when connected to the Wifi at work. It works fine with an ethernet cable plugged in. My iphone and my Roku both connect to the WiFi and run perfectly.  I called Apple and she had me reboot in Safe Mode, and the issue was the same. She suggested I take it in to the Apple store to have it fixed, but I am hoping this is something I can fix on my own. Any suggestions?
