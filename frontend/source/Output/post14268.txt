Mac OS X Upgrade > Cookie Issue <body> After a simple upgrade to OSX Snow Leopard, there is an issue with cookies on any site using any browser.  I have checked multiple times that cookies are enabled and still have no luck.   What's going on and how can I fix this?  <comment15371> What is the "issue" with cookies? <comment15372> sites tell me to enable cookies when i clearly have them enabled.  I checked permissions...  and its not just one site its many. <comment15373> Does it happen with all user accounts on your Mac? <comment15374> Seems to happen with all of them. <comment15378> I've been seeing this with OS 10.6.6 and Firefox 4.  What browser & OS versions are you using? <comment15379> browser is safari / firefox / chrome.  all of them have the issue.  the os version would be the latest mac os x upgrade.  I do not have the exact computer with me right now but will check it tomorrow.
