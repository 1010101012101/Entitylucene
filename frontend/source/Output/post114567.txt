How to unlock iphone 5s? <body> I was given an iPhone 5S for christmas and looks like it is locked to AT&amp;T. How do i unlock it so I can use it overseas? I have looked online but there is no answer except for these suspicious IMEI unlock services. Thanks  <comment134233> the best bet is taking it either to apple, or calling AT&T for them to unlock it <comment235612> I'm locking it as it is an example off-topic question.
