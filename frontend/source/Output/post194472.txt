Why does the iMovie app shrink and remove the top/bottom when exporting video? <body> I have an iPhone 5S with iOS 8.4.  I recorded a video using the built-in Camera app.  This is how the built-in Photos app shows the video:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WS3rr.png" alt="enter image description here"  Then I opened up the iMovie app (version 2.1.2), created a new project, imported that video, did strongnot/strong do any editing, and then exported the video using the "Save Video" option (exported as 1080p).  When I went into the built-in Photos app, this is how it showed the exported video:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GBiKP.png" alt="enter image description here"  Why has the exported video been shrunk, and had part of the top and bottom removed?  Instead of being a tall rectangular video like the original was, the exported video is a square with a lot of black space around it.
