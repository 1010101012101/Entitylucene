Can Pages 5 (a.k.a. Pages '13) import Pages '08 documents? <body> I have quite a few documents created using Pages '08, both in document and page layout mode. I see a fair amount of information about importing from Pages '09 into Pages 5 (the most recent version as of this writing), but haven't found any mention about Pages '08. So can it import from this version? If so, are there any additional caveats I should be aware of?  <answer140399> According to Ars Technica's iWork '13 review, Pages '13 can't open '08 documents.     The iWork '13 apps on the Mac can open iWork '09 files but not iWork '08 files.   If you still have a copy of Pages '09 you could save the documents in '09 format and then use '13 to save them in '13 format.  <answer158718> If you are not dependent on any Pages specific features like the stationary or embedded images your easiest option may just be to export form Pages 08 as a Microsoft Word DOC file.  Then you can easily open the file in Pages 13.  If you dare to entrust your data to a proprietary Apple file format that is.  This lack of backward compatibility over just five years is appalling.  MS Word 2013 can easily open DOC files from the early 1990's without complaint!  <comment165502> Or use google docs as a 'bridge' between both versions
