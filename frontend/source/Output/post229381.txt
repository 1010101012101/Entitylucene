Remap FN key to OPTION key <body> I just got a new keyboard.  How can I remap the FN key on only this external keyboard to option?    So far I've played around with karabiner but haven't had success.  <answer229393> To make this work you have to use a third party tool: Karabiner.  To enable this you have to create a filter for the external keyboard and adjust the modifier keys.

(I do see events correctly when I press CMD and CTRL).  So I think the FN key isn't mapped to anything. <comment279843> @StevenWexler Did you disable *Hide ignorable Events* in Event Viewer - Preferences? <comment279849> Yep, that option is disabled.
