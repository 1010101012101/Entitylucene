Transfer Photos from Mac to Android Device <body> How can I transfer photos from Mac(including iPhoto) into Android phone? When I connect my android phone to Mac via USB, iPhoto can recognize it, but I can only find the import new photo button, then where is the export photo to android phone button?  <answer201919> Find the Android phone in Finder, as it shows as just another USB device. Drag photos from iPhoto to the Android device in Finder.  <answer213841> You can not use USB cable and still manage to transfer photos from Mac to Android device, if you use AirMore, AirDrop or Dropbox to help you.
