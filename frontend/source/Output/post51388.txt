Every time I connect my iPad, iTunes wants to back it up <body> Every time I connect my iPad, iTunes wants to back it up. I don't want to back it up, I just want to transfer some files into an app.  This is with the Windows version of iTunes and I keep aborting the back up, because it's very slow. I want iTunes to stop auto-backing it up, is there a setting for that?  <answer51390> Found the solution:  Under Edit / Preferences / Devices, check the "Prevent iPods, iPhones, and iPads from syncing automatically" item.
