Does Apple TV support Netflix/Love Film in the UK? <body> I was playing around with my in-laws 2nd Gen Apple TV and I couldn't find any way of getting to these services.  I'm fairly sure I remember seeing iPlayer and the like in the old UI when I was playing with one in an Apple store but the UI seems to have been updated since then and I couldn't find any features aside from streaming from a computer on the network.  Have these features been removed are are they just well hidden?  <answer50248> ul liNetflix - yes, just in the last few months./li liiPlayer - no, never has./li liLoveFilm - no./li /ul  <comment106634> This maybe helpful for iPlayer http://www.infradead.org/get_iplayer/html/get_iplayer.html
