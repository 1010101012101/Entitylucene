Terminal CMD + SHIFT + Left/Right Brace No Longer Works <body> I'm using Terminal and don't know if this has been an issue after upgrading to Mountain Lion, or whether I made a configuration change that had a side effect that I didn't realize. When I use the CMD + SHIFT + ] or CMD + SHIFT + [ keys, the mac beeps at me instead of switching the tab I'm using in Terminal.  Is there a way to remap this sequence? Where would I look?  Note, I can use CMD + SHIFT + ] / [ to shift tabs in Safari and Chrome, so this only happens in Terminal. (I also noticed that CMD + 1, shifts desktops instead of shifting to a particular tab; I'm okay with that not operating as I would expect since I don't use that shortcut).  Note, I have switched my CMD &amp; ALT keys on my keyboard, but if I use a keyboard without these switched, I get the same behavior.  <answer101557> Edit: Disregard the first part. [ Is the shift of { so we were saying the same thing different ways. I'm leaving this here though regarding disabling the Mission Control shortcuts.  The sequence to cycle forward through tabs is kbd⌘/kbd+kbdshift/kbd+kbd}/kbd, despite what the Window menu says. (kbd⌘/kbd+kbd}/kbd switches between windows. Very odd.) And kbd⌘/kbd+kbdshift/kbd+kbd{/kbd cycles backward.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DgUVE.png" alt="Terminal&#39;s Window menu with incorrect keyboard shortcuts displaying for cycling tabs"  (You should also be able to reclaim kbd⌘/kbd+kbd1/kbd, kbd⌘/kbd+kbd2/kbd, etc. to switch windows in Terminal, which is what the Window menu says those shortcuts do, by going to System Preferences  Keyboard and disabling the keyboard shortcuts that use kbdcmd/kbd+ a number under Mission Control. I haven't tested this though.)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/k87ku.png" alt="System Preferences &gt; Keyboard Preference Pane"  <comment119727> Ok, This indicates the issue. I'm using MacOS in Swedish. It's making an assumption that I'm using a Swedish-keyboard and the mappings are CMD + Ä and CMD + Ö. I'm using an English keyboard. Is there a way to change the shortcuts for the select next and previous tab. <comment119729> System Preferences  Keyboard  Keyboard Shortcuts tab, click on Application Shortcuts on the left, then under the right window click the + button. Choose Terminal from the Application drop-down menu (hint: you have to go to the bottom of the menu and select Other, go into the Utilities folder, and select it there), for Menu Title enter `Select Next Tab`, click in the Keyboard Shortcut field and press the keyboard combination you want. Repeat these steps, except the second time enter `Select Previous Tab`.
