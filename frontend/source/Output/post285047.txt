Can't boot OSX after creating partition <body> I had boot camp running with Windows 10. I decided I wanted to expand my Windows 10 partition so I created a new partition with disk utility. After that I booted with a windows 10 bootable USB and deleted the current Windows partition (along with others, which might be the problem here) to try and install Windows in the merge of those too. But not only I couldn't install Windows (it said something about it being a GPT partition in whichever partition I selected), but I couldn't even boot back then.  After trying some things out I eventually deleted and formatted a partition and installed Windows 10 in there, but the thing is I can't boot OSX now. It doesn't appear in the options I get when holding the option key while starting up nor does it appear in Startup Disk in recovery mode. The thing is I'm sure the partition is there, because I can read it in recovery mode, but it just won't recognize it as bootable.  I think I might have messed up my GPT or something.  <comment359451> Not sure whether it's strictly a duplicate, but have a look at https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/148980/cant-boot-on-os-x-partition-after-resizing-windows-partition?rq=1
