How to restore Applications & Files from HD Backup (Migration Asst won't read it) <body> I recently had a problem with my MBP which wouldn't start up. After the chime it would shut down. I started using kbdâŒ˜ cmd/kbd+kbdR/kbd and ran Disk Utility. Had issues with my boot partition but no issues on my data partition.  Bought a new external HDD, created 3 partitions as Mac OS Extended Journaled:  ol liBoot Partition/li liOriginal MBP Boot Partition Backup/li liOriginal MBP Data Partition Backup/li /ol  I managed to get all the data saved so I'm reasonably confident I have everything backed up on the external HDD.  I erased my MBP boot partition and reinstalled Mountain Lion. The Data partition remained same and is still fine. Now I want to get all my files/libraries/apps back from the External HDD backup. Migration asst doesn't see Partition 2 and only sees the boot partition.  I'm sure there must be a way to migrate everything back but I can't find a way to do it.br How can I use Migration Assistant with a second partition, or can I use an alternative method to restore my data?  <answer122163> Manually, enable root user, and then you can move the files by hand.   <comment142727> For my own use and others viewing in the future, please can you explain how to do this and why it would work? Thanks
