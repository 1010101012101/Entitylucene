How to install MacTeX 2015 successfully in El Capitan? <body> I upgraded to El Capitan in my new Macbook Air. El Capitan does not allow to use code/usr/texbin//code for storage so LaTeX community had to move their files to code/Library/TeX/code.  MacTeX 2015 is not fully compatible with El Capitan.  There is at least some path reconfigurations which has to be done in individual programs described in the guide.  However, I have not succeeded in getting MacTeX fully working in El Capitan.   h2Fixing LaTeX in El Capitan/h2  All stages went right but not the following with TeX Live Utility.  I am doing the step in the guide MacTEX-2015 and El Capitan (page 3)     For previous versions of TEX Live Utility open TEX Live   Utilityâ†’Preferences and click on the Choose. . . button as in Figure   (4). That opens a file chooser. Type Shift-Cmd-G, enter /Library/TeX   into the dialog box as shown in Figure (5) and then press Return.   Finally DoubleClick on texbin.   I get  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/b5wft.png" alt="enter image description here"  h2After Unsuccessful Setup-2015.pkg/h2  I run coderm ~/Library/Preferences/com.googlecode.mactlmgr.tlu.plist/code to delete the changes made by the applicaiton emSetup-2015.pkg/em proposed by hakaze, because of infinity loop when starting Tex-live with those changes.  I found the codeLibrary/TeX/texbin/code eventually.   hr  How can you set up MacTeX 2015 successfully in El Capitan?  <answer223821> You are misreading the guide when defining the path for TeX programs in TeX Live Utility.  ul liIn TeX Live Utility, open Preferences/li liClick on "Choose"/li liDo emone/em of the following  ul lipress kbdShift-Cmd-G/kbd, type code/Libary/TeX/code, click on "Go", double-click on codetexbin/code and then click on "Choose"/li lipress kbdShift-Cmd-G/kbd, type code/Libary/TeX/texbin/code, click on "Go" and then click on "Choose"/li /ul/li /ul  <comment271303> You probably should run the 'Setup-2015' app (within the Applications/TeX folder) which fixes paths and permissions for the MacTeX installation and GUI programs under El Capitan. This fixed my issues with TeXLiveUtility amongst other things. <comment271318> Which path is defined for TeX programs in Tex Live Utility - Preferences? <comment271322> @patrix /Library/TeX/ described in the guide but giving the error (picture in the body). <comment271323> @hakaze Can you please give an exact path for `Setup-2015`. I do not find such an application in /Library/TeX/. <comment271326> @Masi The setup package is part of the normal MacTeX installation and should be found here: `/Applications/TeX/Setup-2015.pkg` <comment271349> @hakaze I run the application but now when I start texlive it stays in the infinite loop. Do you know how you can remove changes made by the setup tool? I would like to test patrix's method. <comment271483> @Masi You can try to delete TLU's preferences (its default will be re-created at start-up): `~/Library/Preferences/com.googlecode.mactlmgr.tlu.plist` <comment271491> I updated the body of the question. I see no `/Library/TeX/texbin` in the system. I installed MacTeX 2015 by clicking everything. Apparently, something went wrong there. What do you think? <comment271492> Based on the screenshot in the question, you are looking for `texbin` in `/Applications/TeX`, not in `/Library/TeX`. Maybe run `ls -al /Library/TeX` and add output to the question. <comment271494> @masi So `texbin` is where it should be :-) Can you setup TeX Live Utility now as well? <comment271495> You are looking at two different folders here. The second screenshot is showing `/Applications/TeX`, the Terminal output is from `/Library/TeX`. No need to enable hidden files/folders here, I would be more concerned if both would be the same... <comment271496> Thank you for your answer and patience! Now, the Finder search also works for .tex files. It was a complication of unsuccessful MacTeX 2015 installation in El Capitan.
