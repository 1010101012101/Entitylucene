How to order and merge many .ts files? <body> I have many small files (about 500). They are in right order. I would like to merge them.  Linux commands are also welcome because I can compile them in my OS X.  The command codecat *.ts &gt; masi.ts/code does not work well. The result stops at some points. I am investigating why this occurs.  Some parts of the videos are not in order.   Names of parts of videos where each file has a prefix codeHRmasi453-27012016.mp4.ts/code  precode1.ts 2.ts ... 100.ts 101.ts ... 200.ts ... 300.ts /code/pre  so the filename is codeHRmasi453-27012016.mp4-01.ts/code ... codeHRmasi453-27012016.mp4-300.ts/code. The command codecat *.ts &gt; masi.ts/code does not organise the video in the sequential order.  I think I should make a list before of all items in order.  Then, merge.   Pseudocode  ol liMake a list of videos in order /li liMerge codecat items in list/code  ul liDo something like codefilename = prefix + itemInList/code without creating a new list in the while loop.  /li licodecat filename &gt;&gt; result.ts/code/li /ul/li /ol  hr  How can you join the many video files, .ts, files?  <answer225185> Though I have not done this myself I have seen discussions where people have combined multiple video files using the command line version of FFMPEG.  I believe there is a Mac version so you don't have to compile it from source on ffmpeg.org but beyond that someone else will have to verify that and help you with the proper command syntax.  <answer225204> I need to preface this by saying having not worked with code.ts/code files I do not know whether or not they can be simply concatenated using codecat/code and as you saw because the are numerically named they get mixed up when using codecat *.ts &gt; masi.ts/code because it sorts lexicographically, so using a ordered list is in order.  With that in mind, here is what I did to create a list of 500 numerically named code.ts/code files and then concatenate them using the list.  I first created 500 numerically named code.ts/code files containing the number of the code.ts/code filename as a control.  I used codefor i in {1..500}; do echo $i &gt; $i.ts; done/code  These weren't actually valid code.ts/code files however it allowed me to have 500 files to work with and then see that they were concatenated in proper order when opening the codecombined.ts/code file to see an ordered numerical list within the file.  Since you already have the 500 code.ts/code files, in Terminal do the following:  precodecd ts_files_directory echo {1..500}.ts | tr " " "\n" &gt; tslist while read line; do cat $line &gt;&gt; combined.ts; done &lt; tslist /code/pre  br strongUpdated to include actual filename per your comment to my answer and your updated question./strong  The following assumes that the only numbers in codeitemInList/code with a leading 0 (zero)  are e.g., 01...09 and that you change code500/code in the code{100..500}/code portion  of the command to the actual emcount/em.  Change directory to that of which contains the code.ts/code files.  precodecd ts_files_directory /code/pre  The following two commands create the codetslist/code file which is a numerically ordered list of the target filenames to be used with codecat/code in order to avoid the lexicographical sorting issue.  precodeecho 'HRmasi453-27012016.mp4-'{01..99}.ts | tr " " "\n" &gt; tslist echo 'HRmasi453-27012016.mp4-'{100..500}.ts | tr " " "\n" &gt;&gt; tslist /code/pre  With the numerically ordered list created, use the following command line to concatenate based on the contents of the codetslist/code file.  precodewhile read line; do cat $line &gt;&gt; combined.ts; done &lt; tslist /code/pre  <answer250956> cat ?.ts ??.ts ???.ts  all.ts  <comment273222> Not at all sure if this would work however you could try first with just a few files, have you tried concatenating then with `cat`? <comment273226> @user3439894 Thank you for the proposal! There are some bugs. Some gaps in some stages, which I do not understand. I will record the flash show once again and then test again. Sometimes, the order of videos are mixed, probably because of naming. <comment273242> The filename actually contains also `HRmasi453-27012016.mp4-`. So concatenate is required. I run unsuccessfully `do cat "HRmasi453-27012016.mp4-" $line"`. Also failure in `echo "HRmasi453-27012016.mp4-" {1...500}`. What do you think where it is best to concatenate the prefix to the items of list? I think it is not smart to include the string in the list items, taking much space in reality. I think it is better to concatenate then lastly in do cat somehow. <comment273247> Are the only numbers in `itemInList` with a leading 0 (zero) e.g., 01...09 and what it the actual file number total count? <comment273250> See my updated answer. <comment273325> Great! It seems to work. I need to add some globs by `echo 'HRmasi453-2701201?.mp4-'{01..99}.ts | tr " " "\n"  tslist`. <comment273327> I extended the thread to the quality assurance. I am studying the quality assurance of the video merging here http://unix.stackexchange.com/q/258113/16920 <comment273329> @Masi, If the filenames were as you showed and stated up to the last `-`, e.g. `HRmasi453-27012016.mp4-`, then I fail to see why you needed to change it to `'HRmasi453-2701201?.mp4-`.  That said, nonetheless I'm glad you were able to use what I presented.  Additionally I'd like to add that if you'd give more accurate and more complete information when asking a question then it would be much easier to give accurate to the situation answers.  Just a thought. :) <comment273333> Thank you for your comment! I do my best to give so clear details of the cases as I can. Often, however, the case evolves when I understand it better after the interaction with You. Therefore, I feel responsible in editing and updating the case so clear that you can benefit too. Therefore, I also extended the case into a new thread because I feel responsible in sharing the pieces of knowledge that I learned in applying the code in my challenges. They actually are more challenging than I ever thought but manageable. <comment311866> According to the question, all files have a prefix of `HRmasi453-27012016.mp4.ts`, so the wildcards used may need some refinement here. <comment338989> As a side note, if you're want to read in the list of `ts` files by their timestamp, you can change line 2 above to `ls -tr *.ts | tr " " "\n"  tsList`
