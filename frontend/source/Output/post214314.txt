Has Itunes decided to put all of my music in the cloud? <body> I have a imac at home and also a MacBook Air.   Via codersync/code,  I sync a chunk of my music to the Air so that I can listen to it on the train (where I have no signal) and in the office (where there is no public wifi)  Recently, I noticed that nearly all of my music appears to have been uploaded into the cloud - all the tracks have a little cloud icon by then (see image below) - when I click play, it seems to download and then play - fine if I have WiFi, but not really useful given what I described above.   Can I turn this setting off so that the music is there on my laptop all the time, and if I can, will I have to re-rsync all my music onto the Air as I assume its all now been moved into the cloud?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OsU8D.png" alt="enter image description here"
