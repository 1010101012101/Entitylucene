Use middle mouse button (scroll wheel) as Force Touch? <body> I downloaded BetterTouchTool in an attempt to configure my non-branded Bluetooth mouse so I could use the buttons on the side of it as forward and backward - OS X has no facility for this and my mouse didn't come with any configuration software.  I'm using a 2015 MacBook Pro on OS 10.11.4.  I've used USB Overdrive in the past (I uninstalled it as I found it a bit buggy) but it configured my mouse so that clicking the scroll wheel would act in exactly the same way as a Force Click on the trackpad would - I could preview files in Finder, preview web pages in Safari and I could use the dictionary Look Up feature as well. It was really superb, but I can't afford to lay down £15 to buy the full version so it won't hassle me.  Is there any way to configure my mouse to behave like this from within BetterTouchTool? I got really used to it and it was a great feature to have! I can't seem to find any options that replicate this  functionality within BTT though :(  Cheers, Dan  <answer234129> I managed to work it out: if you use BTT to map clicking the scroll wheel to the shortcut kbd ⌘ /kbd + kbd ctrl /kbd + kbd D /kbd, it will show the dictionary lookup box for words, but also allows you to preview files in Finder (like pressing space) or Force Clicking a web link. I had this already configured in USB Overdrive, which explains why it worked before.  Hope this helps someone :)
