Is a Crucial SSD's encryption compatible with macOS Sierra's Filevault? <body> Is a Crucial SSD's encryption compatible with macOS Sierra's Filevault? Can the encryption algorithms or do they, run simultaneously (at the same time) ?  Thanks !  <comment359514> Hmm.. good question. Looks like some people discourage mixing software encryption (FileVault) with hardware encryption. I also read somewhere that you need support in EFI for it and some software to manage the settings? Not sure how this would work on a Mac, honestly... <comment359542> Ah good to know, honestly I was posting here to get feedback from fellow Mac users who might have tried it for themselves. I'll continue my investigation, thanks for your input, I hope someone will have some information eventually.
