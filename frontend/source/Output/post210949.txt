How do I access sshd log messages that are in system.log with /usr/bin/syslog? <body> I am aware that messages on OS X are usually logged in the ASL database which then (based on asl.conf) are also written into files like /var/log/system.log  Based on this comment I tried (emand failed/em) to figure out why messages from sshd are available in /var/log/system.log but are not accessible with e.g. code/usr/bin/syslog -k Facility | grep 'sshd'/code  Any ideas?  <comment254662> strangely enough, I was able to get a couple of sshd messages to show up using `syslog -k Facility -k Sender sshd` but they were totally unhelpful different than what showed up in /var/log/system.log!
