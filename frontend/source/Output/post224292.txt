Bookmark and History <body> I have deleted all Bookmarks and Cleared History in my iPad.  However, when I'm in the address bar of Safari and type www.p, a Bookmark/History shows up that I cannot delete.  Can you help?  <answer224399> Try deleting all bookmarks, history, and cache. If that still doesn't do the trick try clearing all settings.  <answer224402> Are you sure that the Bookmark isn't saved in a subfolder?   You can also try restarting your iPad after you have cleared your Safari History.
