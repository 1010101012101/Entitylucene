How do I troubleshoot "An error has occurred" when trying to update the Kindle app in the Mac App Store? <body> I'm able to update other apps, but for several days now I get "An error has occurred" when I press the Update button for the Kindle app:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MYbGS.png" alt="enter image description here"  I wonder if the App Store is confused since it's displaying "No Updates Available" above the update for the Kindle app.  I'm running Mac OS X 10.7.1.  How do I get more information on this error?  I don't see anything in the Console app related to the App Store.  strongUpdate:/strong I turned on the Debug menu, but it wasn't clear how I could use it.  (So I turned it back off.)  I then deleted the Kindle app, which removed it from the Updates tab.  But now I get an error when I try install it again:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vZtHF.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer25415> If you like XML, you might consider turning on debug mode.  ul liDoes the Lion App Store have a debug menu?/li /ul  If not, use spotlight to find/move to trash all kindle apps and partial downloads, reboot and try again.
