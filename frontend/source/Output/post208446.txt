Can I test the functioning of an AirPort antenna of a MacBook Pro? <body> Recently my Wifi connection has suffered greatly on my MacBook Pro mid2012 non-retina. I now need a much stronger Wifi signal to have a working connection. I did not change my position at my desk (home and office) nor the router hardware. Other Macs have no problem at the same spot.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eZ2yi.png" alt="Wifi issue"  Since the problem appeared right after the OS X 10.10.5 update and others seem to have similar problems, strongI am not sure if I am dealing with a hardware or a software issue here. Is there a way to sort that out?/strong I was thinking one could, for instance, measure the electrical resistance of these connectors here:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uq93d.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  What I tried so far:  ul liAppleCare stress test - no issues found/li lisetting DNS servers manually/li liSMC &amp; NVRAM reset/li lidelete code/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration//code/li /ul  strongUPDATE/strong  It turned out that the antenna cable in the black plastic bar on the screen was in contact with the screen's hinge. So every time I opened or closed the screen, the cable was cut a little more. This seems to be a weak design or faulty assembly in my MBP. I would still be curious how this could be diagnosed without disassembling almost the entire MacBook.  <comment339137> What is the name of the program on the first screenshot? <comment339143> @CanPoyrazoÄŸlu It is a builtin OSX utility: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202663
