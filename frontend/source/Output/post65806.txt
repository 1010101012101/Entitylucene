10.7.5 on a late 2009 MacBook Pro crashes <body> Ever since I installed Lion on my late 2009 MacBook Pro, it crashes several times a day randomly during some operation (open an application, browse the net, add photos, etc.).   I read the answer about updating Show Crash Prefs in System Preferences and tried to do it, but it doesn't work.   I updated Info.plist file with text editor exactly as in the answer, but the Finder still doesn't give the option of selecting new Show Crash Prefs?   Am I missing something?   <answer65807> Does Console give you any information about the crashes that appear at random? Console can be easily found with Spotlight.  <answer65809> Try the following two troubleshooting techniques:  ul lidownload the latest Combo updater for your OS (note this is different than simply going to the Apple menu  Software Update) and reboot/li /ul  http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1582?viewlocale=en_US&amp;locale=en_US  ul lido a Safe Boot:/li /ul  http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1455  Then report back.
