vi shortcuts on bash on mac not working e.g. CTRL + E, CTRL + A <body> I have used vi as my main text editor for years now on Linux (and a few years back Mac too) and on my brand new Mac (running 10.8.4) I find when trying to edit a file using vi in Terminal I can not use the standard vi shortcuts e.g. using 'CTRL + E' to navigate to the end of a line. Instead the shortcut is set to the vim shortcut which is '$' to navigate to the end of a line. I a using bash. How can I get the standard vi shortcuts?  <answer96596> precodeset -o vi /code/pre  Add that to your ~/.bashrc  hr  If you meant to write "I cannot use the standard strongbash/strong shortcuts Ctrl-E and Ctrl-A in vim", then add these lines to your ~/.vimrc  precodemap &lt;C-E&gt; $ map &lt;C-A&gt; 0| /code/pre  If you want these to also work in strikeinput/strike insert mode, you also need  precodemap! &lt;C-E&gt; &lt;esc&gt;A map! &lt;C-A&gt; &lt;esc&gt;0i /code/pre  These maps for kbdCtrl/kbdkbdA/kbd send you to the left margin. If you want to go to the first non-space character  precodemap &lt;C-A&gt; ^ map! &lt;C-A&gt; &lt;esc&gt;I /code/pre  <answer96598> Ctrl-a for beginning of line and Ctrl-E for end of line are Emacs shortcuts, not vi. As such, they will not work in vi.  <comment113400> vi in osx **is** vim. `:h` and check help file. although check this out http://www.howtogeek.com/166616/how-to-use-vim-style-keyboard-shortcuts-for-os-x-tab-navigation/ <comment113406> This will enable vi mode in bash, not in vim <comment113408> that's how I interpreted the question, but re-reading I guess you're right. <comment113416> Having used vi for years on linux I never realised that these shortcuts are from emacs. I have always used vi and any linux machine I work on has had these shortcuts so I guess they have always been specially enabled without having realised these were not from vi. Thanks for pointing this out. <comment113417> The answer from this post seeemd to do the trick.
