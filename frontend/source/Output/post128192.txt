Bluetooth Headset problems in Windows 8.1 <body> I have a Mid 2012 MBP MD101 and a Sony DR-BTN200 Bluetooth Headset that works wonders on Mavericks and my Xperia S.   In Windows 8.1 though, it is only working for a couple minutes each time i connect the MBP to the Headset after a reboot, then they go completely silent; I have to reboot to get them to work again.   I can't go OS X only as the Xamarin project is still lagged behind VS.  All ideas are welcome.  <comment162532> Do you have access to another (preferably non-Apple HW based) Windows 8.1 system to verify whether the connection between computer and headset is more stable there? <comment162534> An old Lenovo laptop of mine used to work just fine
