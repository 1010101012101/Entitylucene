How do I transfer Mac Office (2011) from an old Mac to a new one? <body> Since Office Mac (2011) can only be installed 3 times, and I have installed it 3 times already, is there a way I can get it from one of the old devices I have previously installed it on to my new Mac without buying Office again?  <comment195284> Have you run the migration assistant to move the apps from the old mac to the new mac? <comment195324> It's located at /Applications/Utilities/Migration Assistant.app, by the way.
