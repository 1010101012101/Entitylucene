How to mount local folder with mount_afp in OS X 10.6.8 <body> I tried to use codemount_afp afp://user:111@127.0.0.1/home ~/Documents/code to mount the code~/Documents/code folder to the shared folder, but it shows the error like below:     mount_afp: AFPMountURL returned error 62, errno is 62   What am I doing wrong?  <answer51273> I don't think Mac OS X allows you to connect to your own machine for AFP mounts.  For example, if you go to the Finder, select Go  Connect to Server, and type "afp://localhost", it puts up a dialog saying:     strongConnection Failed/strongbr   The server "localhost" is available on your computer. Access the volumes and files locally.   <answer77251> Not exactly a solution to your problem, but I suggest you to create alias instead.  It's doing exactly what you wanted to do.  But if you still want to afp to local machine, read here.  It involves creating a SSH tunnel to trick OS X of connecting to another machine while it's just localhost.  precodessh -L 1548:localhost:548 mypowerbook.local /code/pre  1548 is the fake port, and mypowerbook.local is your machine's host name. You do need root for this.  Then connect to the afp server with "localhost:1548", and it should work.  But, it's an outdated post, I'm not sure if it will work. Anyway, good luck!
