Disabling the iPhoto Photo Stream App badge icon without disabling shared streams? <body> When I have new photos available in my shared photo streams, the iPhoto icon in the dock has a red circle with a number in it, also known as a "Badge App Icon".  I went to System Preferences - Notifications - Photo Stream and disabled everything, but the badge app icon on iPhoto still shows.  For now I have disabled shared photo streams completely from iPhoto - Preferences, and that has removed the badge app icon, but I would prefer to still keep it enabled.  How can I disable this badge app icon?  <answer102675> You can disable the badge on the Photos app icon in Notification Center settings. Go to strongSystem Preferences/strong → strongNotifications/strong → strongiPhoto/strong → strongBadge App Icon/strong and uncheck the box.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nbur2.png" alt="System Preferences → Notifications → iPhoto"  supI don't have iPhoto on my system, so replace emiCloud Photos/em with emiPhoto/em./sup  <answer114645> I got rid of the red circle number (the notification), by going to  system preferences ➔ iCloud ➞ and then unchecking the box to the left of "Photos"   When you re-check the checkbox, the notifications will briefly display in the upper right part of the screen, telling you about photo stream invitations you have received from other people.   <comment121000> As mentioned in my question, I tried this and it didn't resolve the problem. <comment121001> Well, to be more specific, I tried it by disabling everything from "Photo Stream" in the preference pane. iPhoto doesn't even appear in the list. <comment121005> @CoryKlein Yes, disabling the Badge App Icon for Photo Stream shouldn't do anything since Photo Stream isn't the app showing the badge… iPhoto *should* appear in the list though, as it is an app capable of showing notifications… <comment121006> I heartily agree. I don't understand why iPhoto isn't in the Notifications preference pane either. Doesn't make any sense. Oh, Jobs, why did you have to leave us? <comment135504> This worked for me too.  I had an album that insisted it was new until I did this.
