Error: "couldn't unmount disk" keeps coming up when formatting external HD to eXFat <body> I have a WD "my Passport" external HD that is currently formatted for a PC and I would like to format it to eXFAT. Every time I hit "erase" in disk util it just comes up with the error "couldn't unmount disk". Btw, I am running on Maverick. Can anyone help me with this please?  <answer116549> I had the same problem with the same drive. I finally got it to work by rebooting from the recovery partition and formatting it using the disk utility option.  <answer139102> It's proper for the operating system to not unmount a volume if there is, on the volume, an open file that can not be closed.   h2Recommended reading/h2  The accepted answer to The volume can't be ejected because it's currently in use  ul linote the comment about use of emsudo/em/li /ul  The MacÂ App Store page for emWhatsOpen/em  Posts that mention What's Keeping Me?, e.g. https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/22268/8546  There's another comparable app but at the moment I can't recall its name.   <comment136298> Do you see any processes in Activity Monitor that are higher than usual with the exFAT drive attached? I am curious if there is something like Spotlight or fsck trying to access the drive in the background thus you have issues ejecting/unmounting
