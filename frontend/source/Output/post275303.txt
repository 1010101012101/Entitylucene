Can I turn off swap and/or memory compression on macOS 10.12, Sierra? <body> Is there a way with macOS 10.12, Sierra, to safely turn off compressed memory? And is there a way to turn off safely swap?  This was possible on macOS 10.9 and macOS 10.10. Although it sometimes crashed on macOS 10.10.  On macOS 10.11, disabling compressed memory and swap caused a reproducable issue,  click shutdown and OS X freezes.  Since then I didn't dare to experiment with it in macOS 10.12. But I'm still annoyed that the system wants to use compressed memory for no valid reason (at these fast SSDs I may not mind the swap that much though).  Regarding, vm_compressor_mode (vm.compressor_mode) values for enabled compressed memory in OS X. Value 1 for codevm.compressor_mode/code will this work on macOS 10.12 or crash like on macOS 10.11?  <comment346303> Just buy more RAM. Trying to outguess the OS is a fruitless exercise. <comment346309> Is your Mac storage or processing power constrained? What limits are you hitting with specific processes or tasks? <comment346317> 16G ram I have with the Late 2016 Macbook Pro, also I have a Macbook Air 2014 with 8GB RAM. Believe me, I feel it becoming slow, when more and more items arriving to compressed memory. I also have a retina iMac, there sometimes Soundcloud starts skipping sound when memory is compressed, also scroll of some pages becomes slower, and they are fine when compressed memory is 0. I just want it off, even when you have lots of ram available, a sleep+wake or a half day idle time just puts things randomly there :( <comment346318> Actually this is the reason I restart my MacBook Air at least once a day. By the end of the day it is becoming slower as despite the 8GB ram and most of them being free or only uised for file cache, something is there in compressed. 16 gb ram devices are also restarted once a week and I try not to use sleep for the very same reason (lock screen only) <comment346408> Surely if you ruined compression off you will just run out of memory quicker so it does not help you <comment346570> Mark actually it never runs out of ram, even if it did, would be obviously more optimal to clear from the file cache. It also compresses when less than half of the ram is occupied, that's the sad part (including the 100% droppable file cache) :(
