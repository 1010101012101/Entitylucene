iTunes Match constantly have to sign out/in <body> Running the latest version of mavericks and iTunes and my library is about 6000+ songs.  But after a few days of listening iTunes will prompt me to sign out and back in for match to work. Sometimes closing the app and opening it up again will avoid the issue. But typically after a week or two iTunes match will not work until I sign out and back in again. This typically solves the issue,   Here is the console log when I open iTunes and its prompting me to sign into iTunes match again because there was "an error".  pre 7/22/14 10:09:51.961 AM iTunes[86044]: BUG in libdispatch client: kevent[EVFILT_WRITE] delete: "No such file or directory" - 0x2 7/22/14 10:09:57.764 AM gkbisd[256]: Unable to collect cdhash for /Applications/iTunes.app (error code 100024) 7/22/14 10:09:59.988 AM com.apple.usbmuxd[67]: LOCKDOWN_V2_BONJOUR_SERVICE_NAME is _apple-mobdev2._tcp,936707f4 7/22/14 10:09:59.989 AM com.apple.usbmuxd[67]: _SendAttachNotification Device 30:10:e4:83:bb:a6@fe80::3210:e4ff:fe83:bba6._apple-mobdev2._tcp.local. has already appeared on interface 4.

I've setup new accounts, wiped itunes clean, same thing keeps happening. <comment164584> what about using other user, or using Safe mode. Are you using Bluetooth? <comment164876> found this as well, basically resetting the db file. https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6433525 So far no issues
