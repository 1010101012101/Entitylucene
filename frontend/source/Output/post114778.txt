Microsoft Office 2011 interface blurred on Retina display <body> I am using Microsoft Office 2011 Suite on my MacBook Pro with Retina Display.  The user interfaces are super blur as shown below.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rbr2Q.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ETicP.png" alt="enter image description here"  Am I missing out some patches or paddings or MS Office does not support retina display at all?  <answer114811> According to Microsoft, they've supported Retina Display since version 14.2.4. If you are using an older version of Office 2011, then you should upgrade.  <answer144261> Updating the Version itself which can be found here: http://www.microsoft.com/mac/downloads at the bottom of the website. Download and update it and it should go back to normal.   <comment134538> Thanks for pointing this out! Merry Christmas! <comment221081> Even after updating to the latest version you might still find some Windows and text are still low resolution and I think Microsoft just needs to do something about that. I've noticed this issue on my Retina as well.
