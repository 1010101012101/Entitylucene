Is it necessary to have a TimeMachine backup of the Backblaze Directory? <body> Since I noticed TimeMachine continuously backing up large files, I had a look with codetmutil compare/code to see where those files are located. Since I had not worked on my mac book air but used it to listen to music I suspected the iTunes library.   As it turns out TimeMachine is continuously backing up code/Library/Backblaze.bzpkg//code.  Do I really need a backup of this directory? I see the point that in case I have a hardware failure but my TimeMachine is still working I might need to re-upload everything to Backblaze again?  What would be arguments against putting code/Library/Backblaze.bzpkg//code into the excluded items list of Time Machine?  <answer235982> This file is where Backblaze stores information about what is stored on their servers and copies of files being uploaded or about to be uploaded. I would exclude this from Time Machine backups, as it will often change and contains nothing you're not already backing up elsewhere.   <comment288669> I think this is correct but is there any documentation showing this?
