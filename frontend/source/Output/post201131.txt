Trying to replace volume sound in OS X to what was present before. Encountering permissions problems even as root. Help? <body> I'm trying to get the old volume feedback noise on my MacBook.   I have a copy of the sound file but the system is refusing to let me replace it, even as root. I found this article that also explained it step by step for terminal but even terminal is giving me problems.  I'm currently on a 2010 13" MBP with OS X 10.11 Beta 5 (15A262e). Any ideas?img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lMHd7.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer201150> Try using Disk Utility to repair did disk permissions. Open Disk Utility, select your drive, select repair and then click Repair Permissions. This may fix your issue.  <answer217860> The article[1] you have referenced will not work on OS X 10.11 El Capitan (beta versions included). This is due to the new System Integrity Protection (SIP) feature. SIP is intended to protect operating-level system files (in /System and other filesystem locations) from modification, even by a user with root-level privileges.  If you are committed to doing this task, you could try turning SIP off, following the article, then turning SIP back on. Instructions for disabling/enabling SIP are easily found online.
