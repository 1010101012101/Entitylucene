Mail app always shows most recently read email <body> When I open the Mail app on my iPad the last email read is always displayed. Is it possible to change this behavior?  <answer82621> There is no way to adjust this behaviour on iOS with the current version (iOS 6.1 and prior)  <comment95099> What do you want to change it to? <comment95139> @ClareMacrae I would prefer that the right-hand window was just empty. <comment95159> Ah right. I had a look through the Settings for email, and couldn't see anything to help. <comment95437> Darn. Thanks for letting me know.
