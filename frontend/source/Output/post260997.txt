Can data be recovered after iOS system restore <body> Is it possible to recover data from a restored iPhone. iPhone encrypts data by default so is there any chance of recovery after the key has been deleted during restore like brute force or jailbreaking etc?   <answer263160> No. Once the key is deleted there is no way to recover the data. You could theoretically bruteforce the key, but this would take a very long time.
