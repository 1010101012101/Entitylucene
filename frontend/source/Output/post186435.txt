How to find memory leaking apps in OSX 10.6.8? <body> I have an old 2008 MacBook with 4GB of memory. (Memory from About this Mac, everymac.com gave me a different number.) I know it's old, but it almost seems like it's slower than it should be. I have a lot of software so I was wondering, how could I easily find memory leaking processes?  <answer186448> Activity Monitor.app indicates how much memory each process running on your Mac is using.  <answer246781> To find apps which are using the most memory, try the following command in emTerminal/em:  precodeps -awxm -o %mem,rss,comm | sort -nr | head /code/pre  Also codetop/code command may help to monitor suspicious processes in real time.  In general OS X kernel (similar to others) is designed to use up all the available memory. See: Isn&#39;t Inactive memory a waste of resources? for more details.  If you've limited amount of memory, consider quitting apps or closing browser tabs which you're not using. You can also find some emMemory Clean/em apps which will try free up some memory when it's full.  <comment233013> I know, but some are supposed to use that much memory. Some of them I need as well. Even after quitting them, it just gets worse again. I need to find specific apps that aren't handling memory well.
