Publishing to folder on iWeb produces strange A^ symbol <body> I published a website to a folder using iWeb following the proceedures indicated on this posting.  After publishing, I clicked on VISIT SITE NOW and everything looked fine.  I then proceeded to upload it onto my server and I now see a strange phenomenon occurring.  On almost every carriage return, the new line begins with a strange "A^" symbol.  You can see the results of this on this website.  Is there something that I'm doing wrong?  What can I do to prevent this?  <answer104705> This probably indicates your web server is configured to force all browsers to use Latin-1 encoding.  iWeb pages are always in UTF-8 encoding.  Ask the people who run the server to fix it.  This can usually be done by adding a special .htaccess file to your web space.
