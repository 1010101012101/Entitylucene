Custom Caching Limits for OS X Server <body> In Server Manager, you can set predefined limits for the caching server. Is it possible to set a custom limit? Maybe through Terminal? How do I do this?  I want to limit caching to 100GB but my options are 25GB or 270GB or 755GB or Unlimited.  <answer128726> Your options aren't limited to the numbers printed below the scroll bar. You can drag between the options to select a value closer to your desired value:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/f6iSU.png" alt=""  hr  You can set custom values if you really want to though. The cache size is stored in the strongCacheLimit/strong key in the configuration plist which is located by default here:  precode/Library/Server/Caching/Config/Config.plist /code/pre    precode&lt;key&gt;CacheLimit&lt;/key&gt; &lt;real&gt;268586281855&lt;/real&gt; /code/pre  supThe integer is bytes./sup  <comment150783> I understand I can select values inbetween, however, I wanted to specifically state 250GB instead of 270 or 145GB. If I can enter my value manually that's all I needed to know how/where.
