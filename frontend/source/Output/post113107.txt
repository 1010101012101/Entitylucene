How to restore default fonts on Mavericks? <body> I have deleted the Lucida Grande font from my system, and system bars and menus are full of weird characters. I cannot use my MBA properly. How can I restore system fonts without losing my data?  <answer113109> Place LucidaGrande.ttc in /System/Library/Fonts/.  You can extract fonts from your OS X install media using Pacifist or grab a copy from your backup or another Mac with similar build/version.  For more information regarding recovering system files, see:  ul liHow can I get back a system file after deleting it from my Mac?/li /ul  <answer113137> You can also copy the font from the recovery partition:  codediskutil mount Recovery\ HD;hdiutil mount /Volumes/Recovery\ HD/com.apple.recovery.boot/BaseSystem.dmg;sudo cp /Volumes/OS\ X\ Base\ System/System/Library/Fonts/Base/LucidaGrande.ttc /System/Library/Fonts/code  <answer132389> You can also use codesudo fontrestore default/code.  From the man page:   precodeNAME      fontrestore -- Restore the available system fonts to a pristine state, if      possible.  SYNOPSIS      fontrestore default [-n]  DESCRIPTION      fontrestore detects fonts in /Library/Fonts, /System/Library/Fonts, and      ~/Library/Fonts which are not part of the system install and moves them      to /Library/Fonts (Removed), /System/Library/Fonts (Removed), and      ~/Library/Fonts/Fonts (Removed) directories. Critical fonts required for      operation of the user interface are also restored.       The [-n] option performs the same operation without touching the disk,      describing what would be done without actually doing it. /code/pre   <comment147329> good option if one does not have the install media! <comment147330> should one run `diskutil unmount Recovery\ HD` or something afterward? <comment147354> Yeah, you can unmount the volume with `diskutil unmount Recovery\ HD` but it doesn't matter if you leave it mounted.
