Language problem <body> I set my iPhone on Croatian language and than I added a german language to my keyboard. Suddenty was everything on german! But my icons are still on croatian language and when I open one icon (Facebook, Instagram...) everything is on german! I deleted the german from my keyboard, but everything is still the same!? P.S. my iPhone is bought in Germany
