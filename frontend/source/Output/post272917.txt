How to Remove Default Web Browser Option <body> I installed Private Internet Access VPN and then uninstalled it with CleanMyMac. As far as I can tell there is no PIA folders or files left on the computer (I could be wrong of course). I noticed that in the default web browser options under system preferences, Private Internet Access is listed as an option. How would I go about removing this? Do I have to edit a .plist file? Where would the available default web browser options be kept in MacOS Serra? Thank you.  <answer273537> Open system preferences and go to general (or search for default web browser).   Set Safari as the default.   <answer274040> It seems that the answer to this question is on Private Internet Access' own website. HelpDesk Running the command they provide in the terminal fixes the problem I had.  <comment344465> Thank you but this does not answer the question. The question is not how to change the default web browser preference. I was wondering how one actually removes one of the available preferences that was added to the dropdown menu after installing a program, (in this case Private Internet Access) and that did not go away after uninstalling the program.
