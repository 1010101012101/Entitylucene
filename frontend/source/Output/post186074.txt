Howto run a Terminal command using shortcut or a button <body> I always have the problem in my dock, where the download bar just stops and stays froze. I know you can do a codekillall -KILL Dock/code and it will fix the issue.  Is there a way to click a button or do a keyboard-shortcut that runs this Terminal command?  <answer186077> If you want to use a shortcut to run an applescript which runs the terminal command. here is a question on superuser with the first answer explaining how to make a shortcut to an applescript.  h1How to Make a Shortcut to Applescript in Automator/h1  Make a new service and add your applescript img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7OR4t.png" alt="alt"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/B12jp.png" alt="alt" Make a keyboard shortcut using system preferences  Keyboard shortcuts will work across applications.  hr  Made by rahul_send89 from Super User  Then you can do this as the applescript to the Automator input (As shown on the screenshot):  precodedo shell script "sudo killall -KILL Dock" with administrator privileges /code/pre  I put it in sudo (admin) just in case it would require.  Or without admin:  precodedo shell script "killall -KILL Dock" with user privileges /code/pre  <answer186085> There are multiple ways to do this, here are 2.  h3First method: Create a quick script that runs after a double-click./h3  Create a text file, named codemyScript.command/code. The '.command' postfix will let Finder know to run it on opening.  Add the following as plain text:  precode#!/bin/bash killall -KILL Dock /code/pre  Now the script exists but needs to be executable. To do this you need to do a codechmod/code.  precodechmod 755 myScript.command  /code/pre  Running codemyScript.command/code will open a Terminal window and run the command. The first line, hashbang, will let your computer know to use bash for the following script. You can set the preferences in codeTerminal.app/code to close the terminal window after a clean exit.  h3Second method: Create a 'Service' and bind a keystroke to that service./h3  Create and install the service:  ol liOpen Automator/li liNew Document - Service/li liAdd the 'Run Shell Script' module and insert your code codekillall -KILL Dock/code/li liSet the 'Service receives codeno input/code', save and quit./li liInstall your newly created service by opening it in Finder and choose 'Install'./li /ol  Attach a keystroke to this service:  ol start="6" liOpen 'System preferences' - 'Keyboard' - 'Keyboard shortcuts' - 'Services'/li liFind the 'Kill Dock' service and attach a keystroke to it./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Gcn6B.png" alt="Automator - Run Shell Script"  <comment219626> Please do not use links, if the link dies your answer will have no value. <comment219627> Ok, I will edit question to incl. the contents of the link, and add credit to the owner <comment219678> If I were to add another command to the myscript.command would I just write the other command on the bottom like if I want it to KILL finder and dock. <comment219679> Also I'm Getting this error message, Sorry if I'm doing something very stupid I'm still new to this. I copied and pasted this exactly into the text document (#!/bin/bash killall -KILL Dock) and saved.  Here is the error message http://i.imgur.com/xr55jZh.jpg <comment219731> Added the fix for your problem. <comment219733> @Ilya See [Full privileges on .command file, but it says I don't have appropriate privileges](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/113974/full-privileges-on-command-file-but-it-says-i-dont-have-appropriate-privilege), Gatekeeper isn't the problem here. <comment219735> @grgarside, thnx. I updated the answer. So used to this that I forgot. <comment219778> So I used automator and did everything exactly but whenever I enable the service through Keyboard Commands it doesnt work but whenever I run it in Automator it works and restarts my dock. This it the command I set (⌃⌥⌘D). See it works fine in Automator  http://i.imgur.com/CEYnmqK.png <comment219794> @CousinCocaine ^ <comment219806> @IlyaVorobyev, does your Service exist in the System? You can check this by pressing 'Safari - Services - Kill Dock' (http://imgur.com/7eGVleP) <comment219978> @CousinCocaine Ohh it only works whenever I have text selected. How can I do it so I can hit the command anywhere? <comment219999> @IlyaVorobyev I made this in a rush, and now it keeps comming back with small errors. Sorry. In Automator set the 'Service receives no input'. I fixed this in the screenshot and the text. <comment220318> Oh thanks a lot I get it now :D I'm just sort of new to this. I recently made the change to mac and haven't gotten to deep into it.
