Change the icon of a single, specific file <body> I want to change the icon of a single, specific file, eg. emnot/em all the docs file, only one .doc file (and this change should even persist). Is this possible? How?  <answer225010> ol liOpen the image that you would like to be the icon in Preview./li liPress ⌘A to select the entire image and press ⌘C to copy it./li liGet Info (⌘I) on the folder./li liClick the existing icon in the top-left and press ⌘V to paste the icon from Preview./li /ol  To revert back to the default icon, Get Info on the folder, click your icon and press ⌫.  <comment273026> Ok, but what if I totally remove the original image from my disk? That is: I suspect this "only" creates a link to my image. Please, correct me if I'm wrong <comment273031> @Ian This pastes the image data into the image well, so the image data is copied and does not reference the original. <comment273033> I tried, fantastic! Thanks!
