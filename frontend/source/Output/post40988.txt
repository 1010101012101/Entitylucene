Reinstall Lion, Keep MacPorts <body> After reinstalling Lion, port install produces:  precodeWarning: xcodebuild exists but failed to execute Error: Unable to open port: can't read "build.pre_args":  can't read "build.cmd": Failed to locate 'gnumake' in path:      '/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin'  or at its MacPorts configuration time location, did you move it? /code/pre  and yet Xcode is just where it was:  precode&gt; which gnumake /Developer4/usr/bin/gnumake /code/pre  How can I avoid wiping out /opt and instead point MacPorts to build.pre_args, build.cmd, and gnumake?  <answer40989> Funny; I have codegnumake/code in code/usr/bin/code. You could add code/Developer4/usr/bin/code to your path, for example by running  precodeecho /Developer4/usr/bin &gt; /etc/paths.d/developer /code/pre  (the change will take effect in your next terminal session, I believe).  Beware, though, that the latest Xcode (4.3) requires an extra step to get command-line tools.  <answer43112> Did you reinstall Xcode or is this the remnant installation from before? The installation process is what adds it to the system path. This is necessary for 'port' to find the toolchain.  <comment46433> Did you reinstall Xcode or is this the remnant installation from before?

After rerunning "Install Xcode.app" gnumake reappeared in /usr/bin, and now port install runs as expected. <comment46461> Looking for gnumake in /usr/bin is a nice suggestion, though I don't understand why Lion+Xcode (and not MacPorts) keep two copies of gnumake. In any case, reinstalling Xcode (as I mention in the comment above) solves the problem. <comment48988> @EmmEff: Your comment is the right answer. Could you make it an answer so I can mark it as such to help those using this forum as a reference?
