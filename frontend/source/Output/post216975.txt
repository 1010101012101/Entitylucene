Preview looks cleaner when changing page <body> I was reading a pdf document in full screen mode with preview (MBP mid-2009 with El Capitan) and I've noticed something wired : the document is prettier right when I'm scrolling pages.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/irZS4.png" alt="Clean lines"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Gu9pU.png" alt="Blurry lines"  Is this a bug that I need to get fixed or a feature I can understand/control so that the rendering is sharp always?
