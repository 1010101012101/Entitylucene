How to fix "Killed: 9" error in Sierra? <body> I've upgraded my OS to Sierra recently, in El Capitan I had some apps and they were working perfectly, but in Sierra they show me:  precodeKilled: 9 /code/pre  I even execute them via codesudo/code but they won't work.  Any idea?  <answer266336> ol liDownload UPX. For example, using Homebrew, run codebrew install upx/code./li liDecompress the binary:  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codeupx -d /path/to/App.app/MacOS/App /code/pre/li /ol  Also see “This UPX compressed binary contains an invalid Mach-O header and cannot be loaded.”  <comment323382> From what I can tell, "Killed: 9" just means the app received a kill signal, not why or from what. I don't think knowing that error alone is going to get you/us anywhere. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16338884/what-does-exited-abnormally-with-signal-9-killed-9-mean <comment323389> thnx for your reply , unfortunately it's just shows "Killed: 9" , when I run the app <comment324927> Which means that the problem would need to be discovered/fixed by the app creator him/herself, who presumably has more debugging capabilities than you do. Blame Apple for having such crappy legacy support. :( <comment333918> Possible duplicate of ["This UPX compressed binary contains an invalid Mach-O header and cannot be loaded."](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/251808/this-upx-compressed-binary-contains-an-invalid-mach-o-header-and-cannot-be-load) <comment333951> @grgarside Why do you think this is a duplicate? <comment333957> @patrix Exact same symptoms: working in 10.11 but broken in 10.12, killed with status code 9. <comment333958> @grgarside Without the OP having a look at the logs it's difficult to see whether the issue relates to UPX or to something else though.
