Transferring photos between iPhones keeping metadata <body> I want to transfer all photos from my old iPhone 6 to a new iPhone 7 Plus(both running iOS 10.3.2, if relevant). Since my iCloud is full, I first thought about iTunes, but many photos are shown as blank after backing up the old iPhone and restoring data to the new one via iTunes:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xPr6t.png" alt="enter image description here"  Then I tried Airdrop, but metadata like locations and time seem to be lost, because the order of photos isn't retained.  Finally I tried PhotoShare, but it cannot keep the metadata too.  Please tell me how to transfer photos between two iPhones while keeping their metadata.
