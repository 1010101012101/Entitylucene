iOS simulator crashing on opening <body> I just started developing for iOS devices on 10.9 Mavericks with xCode 5.1.  When I try to build and deploy my application I get build successful but when the iOS simulator runs it immediately crashes. I post the whole stack trace:  http://pastebin.com/iikVeVtp  Any recommendation on fixing this is welcomed.  <comment243123> Does it have to be Xcode 5.1 on Mavericks? Usually bugs like this are fixed in later releases. <comment243195> It has to be a version of Xcode that is supported on my Maverics 10.9. And the latest xcode version that is supported is 5.1. Are we sure that this is a bug? <comment243386> I suspect this is a bug in the graphics stack somewhere.  Are you running this in a VM?  If you really want to stay on Mavericks, can you please at least update to 10.9.5 to see if that fixes the problem for you? <comment244187> Yes. I am running this on Vmware. I cannot update to 10.9.5 unfortunately because its not booting. <comment248824> @GeorgeD, can you install Yosemite and see if the problem is still there?
