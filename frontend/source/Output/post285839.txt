iTunes Music download all songs to be available offline <body> I am traveling abroad next week and in order to preserve data, I want to download all music that I 'own' on iTunes Music to my device.  So I want to avoid downloading each song one by one.  One trick I can think of is to create a playlist of strongall/strong songs and then hopefully I can download this new playlist so that all un-downloaded music will be downloaded.  Is there a better way to easily and quickly download all music at once?  <answer285843> You can create a smart playlist with the attribute codeiCloud Status, is, Apple Music/code and codeLocation, is not, on this computer/code. If you can change the codeApple music/code attribute with codepurchased/code. Also check the checkbox codelive updating/code. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/r7cgR.png" alt="enter image description here"  Now you can make the playlist available offline by downloading it at your device.

Are you using Apple Music and/or iCloud Music Library? <comment360591> I am just using the Apple Music (monthly) service and I 'Add' music without downloading it so that I always stream effectively - however while traveling I would like to have it on my phone's 'harddrive'. Hope that clarifies
