Application switcher does not return focus to immediately previous application <body> A typical use case for the App Switcher is to toggle between two applications.  But this is not working properly: the first app in the switcher is emnot/em the prior one having had focus.  How can I achieve this functionality - which happens to be the default behavior in Linux and Windows?  <comment333962> This *is* the default behaviour in macOS too, so something else is going wrong.
