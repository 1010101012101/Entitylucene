Messaging apps keep reconnecting on my WiFi. What's happening? <body> When my iPhone (7, latest iOS 10) is connected to my wireless network (Linksys E2000), Facebook Messenger and Telegram (another messaging app) keep disconnecting and reconnecting rapidly. In Messenger for example, orange "Connecting..." appears followed shortly by green "Connected" and this keeps repeating very quickly and indefinitely.  I don't have this problem when connected to my carrier's internet or with other wireless networks. At the same time, my wireless network seems to work perfectly otherwise - signal is strong and even HD video streaming is fast and smooth.  I've tried upgrading my router's firmware, changing the frequency to 5GHz and resetting the router.
