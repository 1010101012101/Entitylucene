Strange characters appearing in Terminal <body> When using Terminal, I sometimes get the following appearing.  precodeLast login: Fri Dec 27 22:04:56 on ttys002 ޕ:~ agrimm$ cd ruby ޕ:ruby agrimm$ cd .. ޕ:~ agrimm$ cd ruby/ ޕ:ruby agrimm$ pwd /Users/agrimm/ruby ޕ:ruby agrimm$  /code/pre  With the following screenshot (in which it can be seen that the order of text isn't correct)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PPjSZ.png" alt="Screenshot"  I'm using "Default login shell" in my Terminal settings.  The files mentioned in this answer seem normal. /etc/profile seems normal. ~/.bash_profile seems normal apart from rbenv, homebrew, and Java stuff:  precode# Commented out lines not included if which rbenv &gt; /dev/null; then eval "$(rbenv init -)"; fi export PATH=$PATH:/opt/local/bin export JAVA_HOME=`/usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.6 -a x86_64` /code/pre  ~/.bash_login doesn't exist  ~/.profile seems fairly normal:  precode# MacPorts Installer addition on 2009-12-30_at_14:40:02: adding an appropriate PATH variable for use with MacPorts. export PATH=/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:$PATH # Finished adapting your PATH environment variable for use with MacPorts. /code/pre  I'm using Snow Leopard. codeuname -a/code gives the following:  precodeDarwin ޕ 10.8.0 Darwin Kernel Version 10.8.0: Tue Jun  7 16:33:36 PDT 2011; root:xnu-1504.15.3~1/RELEASE_I386 i386 /code/pre  The problem seems to occasionally appear and disappear.  How do I fix the strange characters and the order of text being wrong?  <answer115155> I believe the name of the volume is causing the issue. Normally the prompt would be like:  precode$ cd ~ volume:~ user$   $ cd / volume:/ user$  /code/pre  Your prompt appears similar, but like this:  precodeޕ:~ agrimm$ /code/pre  Which leads me to believe the volume has an odd character in it's name.  <comment134787> Have you gone into Preferences and tried out a different font? (Nice hat, by the way.) <comment134790> Yes. Turning off my wireless network changed the name of my Volume, making it normal again, and even when I turned it back on, it remained normal.
