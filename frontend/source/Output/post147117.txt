iMessage has stopped working on MacBook Pro <body> I have a 15-inch macbook pro that is mid-2012. The latest version of Mavericks is when the problem started, but it wasn't after the update to it. Just happened one day.  My problem started randomly one day when I tried using iMessage on my mac and all the contacts had turned red. So every time I try to send out a message from my mac, it would immediately say "not delivered."  iMessage works on my iPhone, the only problem is my macbook pro.  I have tried deleting the com.apple.ids.madrid file and that didn't work. I also tried removing my apple ID information from my phone, turning off iMessage on both of the devices, and placing my iPhone 5 in airplane mode for several minutes before turning it on and re-logging in. I can't figure out what the problem is.  I've made sure I'm logged in to my Apple ID, it's nothing like that. I've also tried creating a separate Apple ID just for the purpose of iMessage, but that did no good either.  Please help, it's been weeks and it has become very inconvenient!  <answer147258> Try to use one address (for example e-mail) on all your devises, it worked for me.  <comment181816> possible duplicate of [iMessage stopped working..
