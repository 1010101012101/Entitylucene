Computer should be restarted to connect internet (Mountain Lion on VMware 8) <body> I have strongMountain Lion 10.8/strong on strongVMware 8/strong. I am using strongauto-bridging (vmnet0)/strong for internet service. The internet works find until I pause or turn off the virtual machine. When I resume or restart it, the internet connection does not work. I pinged localhost, but there was no response.  When I restart the stronghost (Windows 7)/strong, then the internet connection inside guest OS (Mac) works fine again.  My laptop is connected to a switch, which is further connected to a router via ethernet. How do I solve this problem?  <answer68952> Mac OS X is only supported as guest OS when the host OS is OS X - and then it only OS X Server that VMware allow the install of.  Therefore I think you are missing some necessary driveres.  <comment80150> But why does the internet work after restarting then? Is there a way to save that "state" or configuration? <comment80166> I don't know what the problem could be ?? Have you installed the VMware Tools on your OS X guest ? <comment80169> No. I will install them now. <comment80170> I installed them from darwin.iso. But the problem still persists.
