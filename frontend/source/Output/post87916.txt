Best rsync options to transfer data between two Mac <body> I am about to move my data from my old iMac to a brand new MacBook Pro. I would like to start over with a fresh install on B and copy just a subset of my data, reinstalling applications from scratch, so I am not considering using Migration assistance.  I am thinking to use rsync to do the job, but I am confused about which options I should use.  Reading man pages, I came out with this:  precodersync -vazHE --progress -e ssh andrea@imac:/remote/dir /local/dir/ 2&gt; errors.log /code/pre  ul liv: verbose/li lia: archive, to keep times, symlinks, permissions, groups, owners and traverse directories recursively/li liz: to compress data/li liH: to keep any hard-link/li liE: to keep extended attributes/li liprogress: to keep an eye on job progress/li /ul  Am I not considering some other useful options?  <answer99482> Personally, I'd be inclined to drop the codez/code switch. Compression is only really useful over very slow connections (mobile data, dial-up) as the CPU is likely to become the bottleneck. I've certainly seen a drop in throughput with compression enabled.  Assuming your network is trusted, you would do well to use a more efficient, but perhaps less secure SSH cipher, like Blowfish or Arcfour, as this will probably speed up the operation a little (it certainly helps with VNC over SSH, or X11 forwarding over SSH). You can enable as follows:  precode-e="ssh -c blowfish" /code/pre  or:  precode-e="ssh -c arcfour" /code/pre  I believe you could also use codersh/code instead of codessh/code which requires a bit of config but is completely insecure, but much faster.  I also use the code-h/code switch to get more human readable numbers in MB/s as opposed to b/s.  Putting it all together:  precodersync -vhaHE --progress -e "ssh -c blowfish" andrea@imac:/remote/dir /local/dir/ 2&gt; errors.log /code/pre  <comment103079> I moved my data and the command worked like a charm. I checked some sample data with MD5 and everything was ok, except for the iPhoto folder, where I had the right size but many more files than expected. I suspect there are some links that where not handled correctly.
