Tools to support maintenance jobs with Finder tags <body> When OS X Mavericks was released in 2013 with tagging support built directly into Finder, I expected tagging on OS X to gather steam (at least among “power users”). However, the number of tools and solutions for using tags remains limited:  ul liHomebrew’s tag/li liLeap/li liYep/li /ul  I am looking for tools to support maintenance jobs like merging tags, listing tags according to frequency, mass re-tagging.  Are there other tools to help with these jobs?  <answer163727> Vitag, a tool for batch tagging from the command line using your favorite editor, was released by Brett Terpstra yesterday.  <comment189763> AFAIK you would have to write automator scripts to do this now.
