Problem using F12 to get specific info on the screen <body> I hope I will be able to properly give my question as I am not a native English speaker and I might be running into difficulty. But I am posting an image to make my problem straight forward.  I’m new to Mac. Had my Mac Book Pro for roughly 1 month. I ran into a specific problem that I just could not solve.  I’ll start out with how I solved the problem in Windows. And my question is how I should have done it in OSX Mavericks.  I had specific instructions from someone to visit a website and prepare a print screen. So I went up on the website with Safari and wanted to start print screening as per my instructions. In order to make my print screen more legitimate - according to my instructions - I had to press F12 and on the lower part of the monitor I should have gotten a window where I could choose from different options. I had specific instructions what to look for in the window that popped up with the F12 key.  I looked through many websites but couldn’t find a solution to my problem as my F12 key didn’t function as it should have in Mac. I tried altering the function keys in the keyboard settings but that didn’t work either. So in the end I took out my old Windows laptop and solved the problem with that. Mind you the correct window that I needed for my specific purpose did not pop up in Firefox or Internet Explorer. I needed to download Google Chrome. (The window that popped up in Firefox and Explorer with the use of F12 did not give me the options I needed).  I hope someone has the patience to read through the above. Also please take a look at the attachment I provide. I would need to reach the same result on my Mac Book Pro as I did in Windows. I do not know what the pop up window is called. But I’m sure someone who is more computer literate than I am will definitely know.  In the attachment provided I am looking to get the window which is on the lower one third of the picture that has “Elements, Network, Sources, Timeline, Profiles” etc.  Thank you for your help.

This will bring up that window on both Mac or Windows.  strongAlternatively,/strong  For Windows:br/ Click on the menu (the little button on the top-right, with 3 orange horizontal lines in your screenshot).

Click Keyboard. On the codeKeyboard/code tab, check codeUse all F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys/code. You will now have to press the fn key to make the F keys do what they show in their pictures. For example, you will have to press codefn+F11/code and codefn+F12/code to turn up and down your speaker volume (or at least thats where the volume controls are on my Macbook)./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ez1X9.png" alt="Step 1"  ol start="2" liIn the same window, click on the codeShortcuts/code tab. Uncheck any shortcuts that use F keys./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MZLxA.png" alt="Step 2"  Your function keys should now behave more like Windows function keys, strongthough not always exactly the same/strong.  <comment137172> The shortcut for Developer tools in Chrome on Windows is `Ctrl+Shift+I`. I'm not even sure why `F12` brings up that window at all, but it does. <comment137175> I'll try it tomorrow and let you know. <comment137178> And thank you :) <comment137181> Yes, it worked. Thank you very much for your help. <comment137182> Is remaping F keys complicated. Normally I do not use them too much. In Windows the most frequent keys were F4 and F11. I do miss the print screen button though. I think print screen is a bit more tedious in OSX than in Windows. But then again I've been a Windows user for over 20 years. I'll have to adjust to the Mac ways :)) <comment137194> I've updated my answer with some directions. That's the best I can do! <comment137195> Also, press `command+shift+3` to take screenshots on Mac. Check this website if you wanna be fancy and take screenshots of only snippets of the screen or whatnot: http://www.printscreenmac.com/ <comment137325> thank you, easy to understand and everything works :)
