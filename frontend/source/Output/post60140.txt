Show github notifications in Mountain Lion Notification Center <body> Simply put: Is there a way to show the notifications on github in the notification center of the new Mountain Lion?  <answer60141> The simplest way at the moment would be to install one of the github growl notifiers, either githubnotifier or gitifier, which forwards github notifications to growl and then use hiss (a separate app) to forward growl messages to the Notification Centre.  <answer89632> Also you can try GitHub client for MacOS.  <comment69250> Sounds great. As far as I know with the new version of growl we wouldn't even need the Hiss App, as it forwards all notifications to the notification center any way. <comment105280> How/why does this work? Are you in some way affiliated? <comment114968> Alex, I don't see how this needs any further information. Even hovering over the link shows (1287-github-for-mac-notifications) heaps of information just in the URL. it's a GitHub app that has Mac notifications. Did you click the link? <comment201995> GitHub MacOS client no longer sends notifications as they deemed that feature unfinished and not good enough. They say to resort to email or web notifications.
