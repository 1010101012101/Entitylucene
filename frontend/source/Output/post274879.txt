Print PDF in one job from different trays <body> I generate PDFs of variable pages where every odd page is on normal letter size (8.5 x 11) while every even page is on a different size (3.5 x 5). I have two dedicated trays in my printer with those size pages loaded.  Is there an app or a programmatic way to print in one job so that the printer grabs from Tray 1 for the odd pages and Tray 2 for the even ones sequentially, keeping in mind that some PDFs have X pages while others have Y (i.e. variable pages but always ending on even page)?
