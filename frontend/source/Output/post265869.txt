Not getting Messages effects on iOS 10.2 (14C92) <body> I sent my wife a message from an iPhone 7 to her iPhone 6S. Both are running iOS 10.2 (14C92), but when she received my message, she got:     (sent with celebration)      (sent with love)   ... instead of getting the cool effects I thought I was sending her. She can see the new emoji that come with the update, but not the new effects.  <answer265984> Not sure what happened, but eventually it just started working. Perhaps there's a glitch in the release.  <comment333394> Did it ever work? <comment333568> I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because this seems to be a non reproduceable issue as shown in the OP's answer
