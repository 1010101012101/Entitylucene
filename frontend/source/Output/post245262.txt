Can I use my Mac to play music stores on an old iPod shuffle? <body> I want to plug my very old iPod shuffle it into my more current Mac and play from my shuffle's play list.  Can I do that and if so how?  I can see all the songs in "My Music" but cant play it.  <answer245274> This should be fairly easy.   ol liSimply select your iPod in the iTunes sidebar/li liCheck the Manually manage music and videos box under "Options" (in the "Summary" screen)./li liNow you should be able to play your music from your iPod shuffle/li /ol  <comment302345> It helps if you identify which models of what devices you have. <comment302358> I don't know if it works both directions or not, but I do know that new devices won't connect with older versions of iTunes. But, as I said, not sure if that goes both directions (such as an older device connecting to a newer version of iTunes). <comment302361> According to [this page](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204095), iTunes should recognize every iPod even older ones.
