preview app showing images pinky <body> The default preview app on mac shows my pictures always in pink. Like here:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KUxui.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  but the file is actually looking like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XKpk6.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  But I want to use the preview app to open my pictures. So what is the problem here?  <comment321985> Is there transparency in the original file?
