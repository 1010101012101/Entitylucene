Cannot access the Internet <body> I don't normally move my laptop. Today I made an exception and took it to a friend's house. Once I've returned home, I was no longer able to connect to the Internet. The browser says: "Server not found" and the system clock does not show the correct time. I don't use WiFi, I connect to the Internet using a physical connection. When I connect the same cable to my desktop Mac, I have no trouble connecting to the Internet, so the problem is not with my router or Internet service provider. I restarted my laptop in Internet recovery mode and was able to browse the Internet while in that mode. Please help me restore Internet connectivity.

I'm currently chatting with an Apple supports representative. Hope she is able to help me. <comment348401> @j-beda: I contacted Apple support. They chatted with me for over two hours. I spoke with three different people. In the end, the issue was resolved. They had me delete the Ethernet entry in System Preferences - Network, add a new Ethernet entry, and then reset the SCM as described in [this](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201295) article ("Reset the SMC on Mac notebook computers"). This fixed it.
