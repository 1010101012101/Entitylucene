Crop animated gifs <body> Is there any free program to crop animated gifs? With GUI, because ImageMagick can do that pretty easily, but I have quite a few different gifs and preset coordinates for batch cropping is a no go.  <answer244758> It's a bit of a sledgehammer to crack a nut, and not the most Apple-like experience you'll ever have, but GIMP can definitely do this.  http://gimpforums.com/thread-is-cropping-animated-gifs-possible  <comment301851> thank you, good old free gimp works, despite fugly interface, I've forgot about it. :)
