Fix mass of broken symlinks <body> h2Problem/h2  I had spent a couple hours going through a ton of files, largely from one folder, and command-option dragging them to create aliases in their destination, ending up with around 350 in the queue folder.  However, I needed to convert them all into symlinks so they'd play nicely with other command-line tools, so I used an alias to symlink AppleScript that had worked in the past to convert them over.  Sometime between running this script that applying the processing tools, I noticed that the links were erroring all the time, so further investigation revealed that most of the links aren't remotely bothering to point to the correct destination.  However, this strongonly/strong appears when using Get Info from the Finder.  If I codels -la/code the directory, the links all have their proper destinations listed.  h2Plan for a solution/h2  ol liThrow all the filenames of the links into a file.  These should be the same as the names in the original directory, but with spaces replaced with underscores (codetest file.doc/code became codetest_file.doc/code)./li liSearch the original directory for the filenames and then create the symlink if a match is found/li /ol  h2What I need help with/h2  ul liOnce I have all the filenames, how do I create a search that uses the list as its input and can handle the fact that some files have an underscore instead of a space?/li liWould hooking up the results of that search to an codeln -s/code be as simple as something like codeawk 'system("ln -s /Volumes/Old_Files/path/etc/"$1" ~/project/InputQueue/"$1)'/code? Or is there a better way to do this?/li liAs a bonus, why would codeln -s/code and Finder's Get Info window display disparate information about the target of the symlink?/li /ul
