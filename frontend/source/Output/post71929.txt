How to change mc (midnight command) bash prompt on OS X? <body> I observed that my custom bash prompt does not work on codemc/code. How do I customize it?   <answer71992> Read the INVOCATION section of the man page, it's there for a reason.  MC is most likely not launching a login shell and you are only configuring your prompt for login shells.  <answer72420> The issue is that .bash_login files are only read when bash is run as the login shell. mc probably just calls a new shell which will read its startup from ~/.bashrc See bash documentation for details.  To make the shell run in a common way it is often suggested that you call .bashrc from .bash_login e.g.  precodeif [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then    source ~/.bashrc fi /code/pre  <comment83588> Excerpt from `man mc`: "An extra added feature of using the subshell is that  the  prompt  displayed  by  the Midnight Commander is the same prompt that you are currently using in your shell." - As you probably observed this is not true, the prompt is clearly not the same, in fact I suspect it's the default prompt for bash `bash-3.2$`. <comment84095> WHere do you set your custom bash prompt? <comment84101> My custom bash prompt is setup in `.bash_profile` <comment84127> I did this and now I see the prompt correctly, still there is a difference: all ANSI escapes had vanished from mc prompts, it's not colored. <comment84177> I suspect $TERM has been changed as man mc says it is " run it in a pseudo terminal," <comment242143> That bugreport https://www.midnight-commander.org/ticket/2027#comment:21 has clear answer:   Is there a way to get the prompt colors show up also in MC?   Unfortunately no. It is not supported, Ð°ll control sequences in the  prompt are ignored.
