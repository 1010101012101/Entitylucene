El Capitan: Notification Center "Today" view resets every time it's opened <body> Ever since upgrading my laptop (2014 MBP 15") to El Capitan, the Today view of the Notification Center has been acting oddly.  When I slide it open, everything seems to reset itself; weather goes away and then comes back, all my reminders are gone and then show up after a few seconds, etc. Same goes for pretty much everything but the Calendar section. It's minor but pretty annoying, especially since it never happened before upgrading.  I haven't been able to solve the problem or find a solution online; anyone have an idea of what to do?  Thanks!
