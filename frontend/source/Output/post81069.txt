Is there a reason an older Macbook won't run Mountain Lion? <body> I needed Mountain Lion because some of the newer software of Apple, such as Xcode, requires Mountain Lion, but besides the iMac 27 I have, sometimes I need to go on trips and need to bring a white Macbook that I bought near end of 2007.  It is indeed a very decent Core 2 Duo notebook (besides the screen dimming a little after so many years because it is not LED type), with an Intel graphics card that is capable of playing all videos and Flash games I tried, but wonder, this Macbook can't install Mountain Lion and so I need to buy either a new Macbook Air for about $1200 or a Macbook Pro for $1800 to $2200 (depending on whether it is Retina).  Is there a reason why Mountain Lion can't be installed on this notebook?  Since it is to run Xcode mainly, graphics card performance is not needed if that may be a reason -- or for other reasons?  <answer81087> Apparently it has to do with strong32-bit/strong graphics cards drivers, as they do not support strong64-bit EFI/strong.   While strongMountain Lion/strong is compatible with any Mac capable of running a 64-bit kernel, the kernel does not support loading 32-bit kernel extensions. So, since the strongearly 64-bit/strong Macs use strong32-bit/strong drivers, Mountain Lion won't load them.  You can find out if your computer has a 32-bit or 64-bit EFI by running the command: codeioreg -l -p IODeviceTree | grep firmware-abi/code  It will return either strong&lt;"EFI64"/strong or strong&lt;"EFI32"/strong.  <comment93502> Would "Back to my Mac" to get back to your home base be an option? <comment93503> but I need to do programming on the road... such as ski trips for a few days... <comment93506> so it would only be possible if a 64-bit driver is written for the old graphics card?  (or what if it is just a mapper (just a facade))? <comment93507> If you manage to upgrade your graphics card, then, *theoretically*, it should work. Perhaps with a facade you'll *cheat* the System into letting you install it, but I will cause a bunch of issues, afterwards. <comment93514> Then you need a new laptop or stay with an older version of XCode.
