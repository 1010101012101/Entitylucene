How do MacBook's verify the macOS installation code signature? <body> I am particularly interested in how the latest generation MacBook and MacBook Pro devices handle this, as I suspect their mechanism could be different than previous generation generation models.   Since MacBook's download the OS install code, it seems that it would be possible for someone to compromise the source, thus making malware "unremovable."  <comment367548> It's not clear how MacBook handles an OS install different from any other iMac / MacPro. Are you after the secure enclave / touch ID or more about how macOS OS install is code signed? To avoid being closed as too broad, you might want to edit this down a bit to start. There's likely well more than 4 paragraphs about Touch ID alone and far more on system install. <comment367560> Indeed - I am referring to how the macOS install code is signed. And good point, I'll update the question to be more specific. <comment367561> *I suspect their mechanism could be different than previous generation generation models*.  Why?  What have you found that would lead you to conclude this? <comment367715> Apple has indicated so in response to some firmware attacks that affected pre-2013 Mac devices. I've also spoken to Apple specialists who unfortunately did not know how the models operate.
