iMac iPhone USB Internet Sharing <body> I have a MacBook Pro and a iMac. On the MacBook I see a network interface named "iPhone USB" in my Network Settings. On the MacBook the internet sharing over usb works fine. But on the iMac it doesn't work. On the iMac there is no "iPhone USB" interface and it doesn't appear a "New network device detected" window if I connect the iPhone to the iMac via USB. How can I add the "iPhone USB" network interface?  Please help.

Specficially the USB Trouble Shooting information.     If you are using USB to connect your computer to Personal Hotspot and you are unable to get an Internet connection, check your computer's network settings.

Locate and select the Ethernet adapter listed, and then click the gear icon and choose Make Service Inactive.

Apple provides no information about when the "New network device detected" window doesn't appear. <comment48561> Do you have iTunes Running when you do this? <comment109332> @MrDaniel :: Does iTunes running make any difference ?
