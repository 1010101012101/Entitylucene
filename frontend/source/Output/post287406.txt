Noise in Audio Jack when HMDI is Connected (Disable HDMI Sound) <body> I have a MacBook Pro 2017, a USB-C hub, a HDMI Display and external speakers connected to the audio jack. As soon as the HDMI cable only touches the USB-C Hubs input, the signal on the audio jack gets noisy (Audio is set to headphones, the monitor does not make any sound or noise).   My idea is to disable the sound for the HDMI in general because I don't need it. I think it might be related to ARC
