Any good multi-threaded SFTP clients for Mac? <body> I am amazed that there doesn't seem to be a decent multiple connection capable FTP/SFTP client for Mac.  The only one I've seen is CaptainFTP, which looks awful, like it's from the last century.  There's also iGetter, which is equally ancient, and not really set up as a browser, more of a download accelerator.  I've been using lftp, which is strongamazing/strong, but CLI only, which makes it a pain.  Does anyone know of either (a) a "modern" client app which supports multiple connections, or (b) a GUI for codelftp/code?  <answer169108> Have you checked out Fetch (http://fetchsoftworks.com) or Interarchy (https://nolobe.com/interarchy/)? They both allow simultaneous connections to multiple remote servers, remote-to-remote transfers, SFTP, and lots of other handy and solid features from long development histories with feedback from many users.   <comment198525> Have you looked at [Transmit](http://panic.com/transmit/)? Supports multiple connections, SFTP and WebDAV, Amazon S3.. <comment198530> Just tried it; but transfer capped out at 40 mbps. lftp gives me 100 mbps (the server limit.) <comment198531> Tried both. Neither would go any faster than 20-25 mbps. And very uneven speed. lftp gives me consistent 100 mbps (limited by server internet bandwidth.) <comment198532> The only other recommend that I would have is [Filezilla](https://filezilla-project.org). <comment198547> Filezilla maxed out at 30 mbps <comment199289> Interesting - that's quite a difference. Does lftp achieve that through use of its ability to asynchronously issue multiple ftp commands? How does it do with just one large file? <comment199290> I have no idea how, I just wish it had a GUI!
