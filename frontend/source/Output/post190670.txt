Would Xcode 7 and swift being open source make it easier to create jailbreaks? <body> From the WWDC that was on a few hours ago, it was shown that swift will be open source. This answer for a question (here) says that you no longer need to have a paid developers account to install custom apps onto your iOS device.  The question is would a hacker be able to change swift slightly and allow users to install an app on their device via Xcode to gain root permissions?  Previously to jailbreak you would need to run an application on your computer to exploit the device and add application to gain root privilege. Could this be bypassed now with the new changes?  <answer190685> I can't see Apple not making enough security restrictions for this to happen and I'm sure Xcode would always use a specific branch of Swift.  However, Swift being open source might attract a larger amount of hackers from the future Linux-Swift community.  In all seriousness though, I don't think we can answer this question now when we still don't know how and to what extent is it going to get open sourced and how will it affect iOS development.
