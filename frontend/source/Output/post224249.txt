VPN question on MAC <body> My customer has provided me these inputs to connect to their network:  ul liServer IP/li lipkcs (.p12) file /li liAnd a Certificate/li /ul  On Windows, I installed the .p12 file into the Local store, imported the CERT into the Cisco VPN client, added a new entry with server IP and pointed the certificate to the imported cert (file).  Now how do I do these steps on MAC El Capitan? I added the .p12 file into the keychain (System level) and also imported the certificate. I am creating a new entry under Network - VPN - Cisco IPSEC and selecting this CERT under authentication. When I try to connect, I see an error "an unexpected error occurred". What did I do wrong?  <answer224262> I found a thread on Apple's forums with similar issues to yours. [link]  Here's a solution that worked for one user although I allow myself the indulgence of finding his security practice rather terrifying.     I granted client certificate's private key access to all applications and  set always trust certificate in the Keychain Access.   After that racoon successfully connected to vpn server. (there were about  5 lines of errors in a log, but vpn worked)   Next, I returned certificate's trust policy to system defaults. (private  key access reverted automatically).   Now it works without errors.   I would rather recommend trying this method (next post from the source)     I used Keychain Access to modify the private key's trust policy. However, instead of setting it to all application, I just gave access to code/usr/sbin/racoon/code.   Racoon is a process that is (also) used by OS X's VPN solutions.  This suggestion is based on the following lines:  precode1/20/16 3:08:02.860 PM com.apple.SecurityServer[84]: Authorization via securityd no longer supported 1/20/16 3:08:02.861 PM racoon[6269]: error -25308 errSecInteractionNotAllowed. 1/20/16 3:08:02.861 PM racoon[6269]: error -25308 errSecInteractionNotAllowed. 1/20/16 3:08:02.861 PM racoon[6269]: failed to sign. 1/20/16 3:08:02.861 PM racoon[6269]: failed to sign. 1/20/16 3:08:02.861 PM racoon[6269]: failed to get sign 1/20/16 3:08:02.861 PM racoon[6269]: failed to get sign 1/20/16 3:08:02.861 PM racoon[6269]: failed to allocate send buffer 1/20/16 3:08:02.861 PM racoon[6269]: failed to allocate send buffer 1/20/16 3:08:02.861 PM racoon[6269]: IKE Packet: transmit failed.

Still doesn't work. I created a blank file /etc/authorization just to see. Not much of a difference. Same logs are seen.  1/20/16 10:32:10.069 PM com.apple.SecurityServer[84]: Parsing rules file "/etc/authorization": Cannot parse a NULL or zero-length data <comment272029> I didn't suggest messing around with the `/etc/authorization` file because it was deprecated (it will be removed in a future version of OS X).
