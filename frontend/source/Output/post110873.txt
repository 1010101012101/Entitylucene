Could not connect to "Apple TV" <body> I have recently updated both my Mac &amp; Apple TV software now my Airplay mirroring is no longer working (though does through iTunes) I just receive a message saying Could not connect to "Apple TV" when clicking on the Airplay icon. It's not a WiFi issue as I can still access my computer via apple TV.   <comment130519> Using password or screen code or what ever it was named? I have problems with audio in airplay, I think problem is current AppleTV software, because earlier it  worked perfectly.
