Recover data from Windows XP Parallels since Mavericks incompatibility <body> I am using a Mac Pro with Parallels and Windows XP. It was working until I upgraded the Mac with OS X Mavericks and now Windows XP is no longer compatible. How can I retrieve my data from XP?  <comment150893> have you updated your Parallel's to the latest version? I bet there is a new version that is compatible and will allow your XP to boot again.
