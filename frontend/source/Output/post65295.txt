Mountain Lion boot time extremely slow! <body> After I upgraded to Mountain Lion my MBP (late 2008) started to boot extremely slow. Last time it took 2 hours 46 minutes to boot, now it's already booting for 40 minutes.  I've tried kbdcmd/kbd+kbdr/kbd (just after restart), which brings up recovery mode; I've tried to repair the drive (via Disc Utilities), but no errors were found; I've tried to fix permissions and etc. I even tried to reinstall (not clean one, just on top).  Any of you know cause/solution to this? (Except clean reinstall, since I really don't want to do it now.)  Also, if I must clean reinstall, is it possible to do it via recovery mode? Or I must have bootable usb/cd etc?  <answer65302> This problem may be the result of failing RAM or a failing disk drive or potentially some other hardware problem.

Just to answer your question, it is possible to reinstall in recovery mode as long as you're connected to the internet. You'll have to download the OS again so it'd be much faster to install using a CD or USB. Speaking of USB, you can create a bootable copy of OSX onto a USB stick and boot to that. If it works then you can rule out your RAM being the issue.
