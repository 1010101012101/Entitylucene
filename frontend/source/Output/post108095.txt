What is the "guest" password? <body> I tried looking for the "guest" password by doing the command codedscacheutil -q user/code and found the guest account. I saw that there was a "password" (I know that the usual guest account does not have a password) so may I ask what is the "guest password"?  Terminal output snippet:  precodename: Guest password: ******** uid: 201 gid: 201 dir: /Users/Guest shell: /bin/bash gecos: Guest Account /code/pre  By the way, I want to use my knowledge to show off Terminal's codesudo/code without using login or su. (I do not want the commands codepasswd/code or anything similar from that)  Edit: As of El Capitan, the Guest user will output one star as below:  precodepassword: * /code/pre  <answer108110> strongThe 'Guest' user does not have a password./strong  The command you are using: codedscacheutil -q user -a name guest/code always outputs 8 stars (code********/code) no matter what password the user actually has set. As OS X only stores the hashed password, there is no easy way (besides using a password cracker) to recover passwords.  Edit: Hashed, not encrypted.  <comment204629> Actually the password is hashed (one way function) and not encrypted. Otherwise it would be possible to decrypt it (with the proper key).
