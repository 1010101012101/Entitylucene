What readers annotate PDFs better than the Preview app? <body> I usually spend around 3 or 4 hours a day working with and annotating PDFs. I've always used Preview, but there's a few things that bother me about it. Mainly the large icons used when you place notes, which can get in the way in tightly formatted documents.   Is there an alterate PDF reader that is any better for annotating documents?  <answer7668> Skim is a pdf reader specialy designed to annotate pdf.  emSkim is a PDF reader and note-taker for OS X. It is designed to help you read and annotate scientific papers in PDF, but is also great for viewing any PDF file. Stop printing and start skimming.

Yet, I had some issues that it would not display the annotations on every platform. I like to use Adobe Illustrator for annotating. Yet, you will need a lot of processing power + it's not really cheap (if you just want to use it for annotating, don't bother buying it).  There's also http://jarnal.wikispaces.com/ (opensource, yet ugly java ui)  Overview about note-taking software for different platforms:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_notetaking_software  <answer7736> To be honest if you are spending that amount of time a day with PDFs its worth buying Acrobat Pro. Its not cheap but nothing else comes close in terms of its feature set. I have found version 10 to be really stable too.  <answer7781> There are plenty of good PDF readers on Mac, including: Formulate Pro, http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/19911/formulatepro  PDFPen and PDFPen Pro (a little bit expensive but really good software)  PDF Checkpoint that I like very much which allows you to automate your workflow.  You should try their free version to see which one suits your needs ;)  <answer7783> While not meant primarily for your use case, I found Mendeley Desktop to be quite adept at highlighting and annotating.  <answer269387> PDF Expert is hands down the best pdf editor made.  Better than Acrobat.  <comment8293> I also had some issues with the annotations portability, but not only with skim. For example, annotations created by Preview can't be viewed by okular on linux. <comment8302> Check out Skim and I love it. Thanks! <comment287277> Mendely doens't use standard PDF annotation. What you annotate in mendeley has not readable by other PDF reader. It can be a problem. <comment338404> Welcome to Ask Different!
