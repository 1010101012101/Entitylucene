Do I have to create a contact entry for *myself* to use Siri? <body> Siri keeps telling me "I know nothing of you who are or where you live"  <answer122720> Yes you do. Siri uses the contact information from the contact you select in Settings &rarr; General &rarr; Siri &rarr; My Info.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pbNbL.png" width="320"  If you do not have a contact selected there, Siri will not know your address, etc.  <comment143286> no I enabled location services for siri and now it works
