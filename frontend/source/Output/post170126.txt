Out of storage space in X11 app <body> I have a app that runs in X11 and it seems to be ok except that I get out of space issues even though I have plenty of space on my home drive. Is there some setting or way to increase this? Please help!  <comment199977> Forgot to say the X11 app is running on the Mac, not a remote host... <comment199980> Can you please provide additional details like the X11 application you are using and screenshots both of the error message and Activity Monitor (when the error occurs). <comment199985> It's a app I am developing which runs on Linux and OSX. The error I get are running out of swap and boot drive being full... Works fine under linux
