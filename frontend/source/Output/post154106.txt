How to disable Spotlight indexing when on battery? <body> Every time I add a few MBss of files to my SD disk, Spotlight starts eating battery (per Activity Monitor Energy Impact) for one to several days indexing them.  How can I make indexing to turn off automatically when on battery power, and enable again when Macbook is powered from an AC outlet?  <answer154113> Open your Terminal and type the following to disable.  precodesudo mdutil -i off / /code/pre  To enable again, replace off with on.  For more info, you could type:  precodeman mdutil /code/pre  <answer154116> jherran's answer helps you with disabling Spotlight indexing, but does not address the part of the question about toggling automatically when AC power is connected or disconnected.  You could use codesudo mdutil -i off //code and codesudo mdutil -i on //code in conjunction with a listener for when AC power is disconnected. Using something like ControlPlane will satisfy your requirement for automatic toggling. It supports "Current power source" as an event to listen for. It is free and open source.  You might be against using a third party solution. To roll your own, try writing a script that loops checking codepmset -g ps | grep -c 'AC Power'/code with a sleep interval in between. If AC is connected, it outputs 1 (0 otherwise).  <comment181375> As @aglasser suggests, your answer "does not address the part of the question about toggling automatically when AC power is connected or disconnected". Hence the downvote. <comment209162> I would be grateful for a sample scrip doing just that for no-third-party case. And I failed to make ControlPlane work correctly for this purpose.
