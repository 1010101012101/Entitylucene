Playing alert sounds from terminal <body> Is there a way to play OSX alert sounds from terminal? The alert sounds that are listed in System Preferences  Sound  Sound Effect Tab  <answer96371> If you have "audible bell" enabled in your Terminal Settings under Advanced, BEL control characters will sound the default alert sound.  To try this, issue the codeecho/code command followed by kbdcontrol/kbd+kbdv/kbd kbdcontrol/kbd+kbdg/kbd.  If you type it right, it will look like this:  precode$ echo ^G /code/pre  and when you press kbdreturn/kbd, the alert will sound.  (kbdcontrol/kbd+kbdv/kbd is a shell escape for the immediately-following control character.)  The codeafplay/code command can also be used to play a specific sound file:  precode$ afplay /System/Library/Sounds/Funk.aiff  /code/pre  <answer219822> Another option, with less modifier keys, is to use the command codetput bel/code.  <comment113152> Thanks! Didn't know about afplay :). <comment273032> I liked this answer because I disabled the "audible bell" in my terminal settings, but `tput bel` calls the "visual bell" so I still get the alert that I want without the noisy one
