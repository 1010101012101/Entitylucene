Force OS X to use framebuffer? <body> I have an unfortunate hardware problem with my MacBook Pro (mid 2014) where the integrated graphics have become faulty and after a while, use of hardware acceleration causes the system to crash. I'm getting a new laptop soon, but...  Is there any way to force the OS to not load the graphics driver on boot and only use the framebuffer? This would be unloading codeAppleIntelHD5000Graphics.kext/code.
