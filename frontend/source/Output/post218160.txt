Automatically deleting files that contain a specific content <body> I would like to make use of the command that looks for a specific phrase in a file:  precodegrep -lr "text to find" * /code/pre  provided here and delete all of the found files. How can I generate the relevant terminal command?  <answer218162> Assuming you want to delete them without further ado, use  precoderm $(grep -lr "text to find" *) /code/pre  The code$(..)/code runs the command within the parenthesis and uses its output as arguments for coderm/code.
