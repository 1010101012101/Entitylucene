Does the early 2014 MacBook Air use Thunderbolt 1 or Thunderbolt 2? <body> I am considering purchasing a new MacBook Air (early 2014 edition). I'd like to drive two external monitors from the laptop.  Based on my reading the 2013 Air only supported Thunderbolt 1 and therefore DisplayPort 1.1. With the semi-model-refresh that occurred in early 2014 was the Thunderbolt controller updated to version 2 and therefore DisplayPort 1.2?  <answer129396> This french article says yes Thunderbolt 2 strongbut/strong :   ul liApple markets it as a TB2. /li liBut the processor has only 6 PCIe lines :  ul li1 for the webcam/li li1 for the wifi /li li2 for the SSD/li /ul/li /ul  Leaving only 2 PCIe lines for the thunderbolt which is barely enough for the TB 1 specs (in terms of bandwidth).   <answer129397> No, The Early 2014 MacBook Air has Thunderbolt 1 and therefore DisplayPort 1.1.  Source : Apple Support Page  <answer129543> Mid-2012 and later MacBook Airs do support two Thunderbolt displays (see this document from Apple), but if you're not using Apple displays it's a bit more complicated.   You'll need to either invest in something like this Mini DisplayPort to dual HDMI adapter, a Matrox DualHead2Go or a DisplayLink USB adapter (those do have issues with newer Macs and Mavericks though, I believe).  <comment151439> and regarding your intention to buy a MacBook : You should probably wait for the MacBook Pros to get TB2 first (buy them if you like) - and after that wait for the MacBook Airs to get TB2.
