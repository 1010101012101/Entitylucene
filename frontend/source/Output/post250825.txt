Dprtb.com redirect to alert.mac-notification.com... Virus on Mac? <body> Well I just typed to Safari the address blizzad.com (accidentally) and it redirected me on dprtb.com and then on alert.mac-notification.com. On alert.mac-notification.com I got message "Your Mac has been infected...click ok" (or something like that). So i closed the tab.  What should I do? Is there really a virus or this message is a drivel?  <comment311580> No. it's just a webpage, and unless you downloaded anything, nothing will happen to your Mac.
