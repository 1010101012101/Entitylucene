I have trouble accessing my Mac <body> After I accidentally left my Mac on my balcony last summer and after a heavy rain when typing the mac keyboard only symbols appear.   When using external keyboard things have worked smoothly since until today when I turned on Filevault.   Now suddenly it wouldn't accept my password any longer.   Now I can only access the guest account on my mac.    And the Mac wont recognize my password even after the restore password--- nothing happens in keyboard when i try to type these passwords.   I have even tried resetting the PRAM but it would not work. Any suggestions?   <answer138775> What Mac are you using (Macbook Air / Pro)? Does it have a replaceable disk?  If the disk is not replaceable, I see the following options:  ul liemAssuming the/em codeT/code emkey is still functional:/em Access your Mac in target mode and unlock the disk from the other computer. For example this article explains the procedure./li liemAssuming the/em codecmd/code emand/em codeR/code emkeys are still functional:/em Recovery Mode/li liemAssuming the/em codealt/code emkey is still functional:/em Same as above, but you manually select the recovery partition/li /ul  Sometimes the filevault2 volume cannot be opened easily. See here for a workaround.  If the disk is replaceable I would remove it asap, unlock the disk, and save the data e.g. with an USB-IDE adapter (like this one).  <comment163647> if you do not like my edit let me know. <comment163709> What do you want to know? How to save your data? Obviously you should have your keyboard fixed...
