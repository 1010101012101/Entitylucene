How to block and unblock https access on OS X 10.9 <body> I am working on a test project that requires me to block https access for a specific app on my Mac (OS X 10.9).   The instruction provided are "Chinese" to me and I have no idea where to start:  (Example: Alter the iptables)br Steps:  ol liBlock the port:  precoderoot@QA9:/opt/appname/appnamerouter2# iptables --list root@QA9:/opt/appname/appnamerouter2# iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --destination-port 443/8443 -j DROP root@QA9:/opt/appname/appnamerouter2# iptables --list /code/pre/li liFor Open the Port:  precoderoot@QA9:/opt/appname/appnamerouter2# iptables -D INPUT 1 /code/pre/li /ol  <answer112250> It is not an answer in regards of the commands you have but a quick solution/workaround might be Little Snitch which doesn't force you to learn the terminal commands - but does need a little work to learn how to engage it selectively.   It's a graphical tool which makes some people much more comfortable when configuring an application firewall. It also comes with great support and several nice guides for getting started.  <answer112256> Maybe editing your host file could help. You can find some help here about editing host files:  http://decoding.wordpress.com/2009/04/06/how-to-edit-the-hosts-file-in-mac-os-x-leopard/  Little Snitch is proprietary, the open source software I use for this is 'gas mask' :  http://www.clockwise.ee/gasmask/  <comment131813> Editing host file won't selectively block the ssl ports and leave the other ports open. That might be sufficient for the testing needs, but I would guess they wouldn't have identified iptables to block specific ports if a broader / easier to accomplish block was feasible. <comment131955> Worked! Thanks!
