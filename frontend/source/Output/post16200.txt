How can I combine multiple font files into one family? <body> I have several font families that have different naming styles. The results is that instead of all those fonts showing up as one family, there's a separate family for each font variation (bold, black, thin, italic, etc).  This makes my font list messy. Is there a way to combine multiple font files into one family?  <answer16213> If you're not afraid about command lines, I suggest you ttf2ttc. *.ttc files are TrueType fonts Collection
