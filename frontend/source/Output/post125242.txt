Backing up/Restoring Messages history on Mavericks <body> Is there some means of saving your Messages history on OS X and copying it to a new system without doing a full restore from a Time Machine back up?  Doing some searching, I found the below and tried this approach in a virtual machine copy of Mavericks without much luck.       https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5948332   Despite copying the files to their respective locations on the fresh install and adjusting permissions, the new installation version of Messages never seems to import/recognize the history from my current system.  To ensure my permissions were okay, I also found     Mavericks Mail will not save preferences   which was linked to by     Fixing broken Messages on OS X Mavericks   but this also did not result in Messages importing/using the copied history.  Both instances of Mavericks are using Messages 8.0  <answer173940> Yes, it is possible to import message history from a Time Machine backup onto a new machine without a full restore from a Time Machine backup. This was tested on 10.10 but should work for at least 10.9 as well.  ol liTake a full Time Machine backup of the new system./li liQuit Messages.app./li liRemove all of the following files and directories on the new system: ul liem~/Library/Caches/com.apple.iChat//em/li liem~/Library/Containers/com.apple.iChat//em/li liem~/Library/Messages//em/li liem~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.imessage.bag.plist ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.imservice.FaceTime.plist ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.imservice.iMessage.plist ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.imservice.ids.FaceTime.plist ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.imservice.ids.iMessage.plist ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iChat.AIM.plist ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iChat.Jabber.plist ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iChat.LSSharedFileList.plist ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iChat.StatusMessages.plist ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iChat.Yahoo.plist ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iChat.plist/em/li /ul/li liCopy the following files and directories from your Time Machine backup to their respective locations on your new system: ul liem~/Library/Containers/com.apple.iChat//em/li liem~/Library/Messages//em/li liem~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.imessage.bag.plist ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.imservice.FaceTime.plist ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.imservice.iMessage.plist ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.imservice.ids.FaceTime.plist ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.imservice.ids.iMessage.plist ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iChat.AIM.plist ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iChat.Jabber.plist ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iChat.LSSharedFileList.plist ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iChat.StatusMessages.plist ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iChat.Yahoo.plist ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iChat.plist/em/li /ul/li liRestart your system/li /ol  <answer262025> Thanks for the process - working for 10.12 note: there were 2 files in Preferences i could not find but it seems to be working so far: ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.imservice.FaceTime.plist ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.imservice.iMessage.plist  Thanks again!  <comment205042> Seems reasonable enough and the process makes sense.  I'll give this a go in a virtual instance and go from there.  Looks very promising.  Thanks! <comment315773> No luck using this method in macOS 10.12. <comment315827> Correction: had success on Sierra after a second attempt. <comment318285> @MichaelAhlers If things are different on Sierra, can you add a new answer describing the necessary steps? <comment328198> Welcome to Ask Different!
