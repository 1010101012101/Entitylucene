Chrome slow when loading local virtual host <body> I'm developing a local website with MAMP. I've configured a virtual host (hosts files, and apache vhosts).  code/etc/hosts/code file:  precode127.0.0.1   domain.com /code/pre  MAMP Vhosts config  precode&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;     DocumentRoot "/route/to/folder"     ServerName domain.com &lt;/VirtualHost&gt; /code/pre  It all works fine, but in Chrome sometimes the local website takes a few seconds to load, when it should load instantly. I've narrowed down the problem to Chrome as it works fine 100% of the time with Safari.  When this happens in Chrome, the status bar at the bottom says "resolving host". It would seem like it's waiting for a DNS server to respond... but isn't the codehosts/code file overriding any DNS calls?  Any ideas what might be happening?  <answer113961> The solution was to move the domain in the code/etc/hosts/code file to the same entry as localhost.  precode127.0.0.1   localhost domain.com /code/pre  See this StackOverflow thread.  <comment133602> Have you tried with a blank Chrome profile, in case it's a setting/extension? <comment133603> I've disabled all extensions and the problem persists... As for the settings, I don't see what could be causing this. <comment150244> You should mark this as the correct answer. :)
