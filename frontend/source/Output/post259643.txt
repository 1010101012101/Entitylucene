How do I kill Siri <body> In other words, which file causes Siri to stop changing PID?  Even though I force process to quit, it will spawn again.img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/y2nYz.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer259645> Mac Preferences - Siri - uncheck Enable Siri checkbox. - Reboot.  This will stop Siri from running.  To answer your question about changing PIDs, PID is a Process ID. Anytime a new process is created, it'll always change its ID to a new one. There is no changing this as it's a flow of how processes and multithreading work.  <comment324867> In the voice of HAL 9000 from 2001: A Space Oddesy, I'm sorry FullMetalFist, I cannot allow you to do that. :)
