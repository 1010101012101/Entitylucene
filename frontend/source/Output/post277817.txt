Is there a way to change the calander view? <body> I'm subscribed to some events calendar and its very common to have overlapping events with long descriptions.  It is extremely hard to read, even in the day view. See image below.br Because the events overlap, I couldn't click, to read more details for some events.  Is there perhaps a list view, or any ways to deal with this?br Hopefully without 3rd party solutions.  strongUpdate/strong: Screenshot based on macOS (10.12.4) Calendar app  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/keRON.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment349683> Would you be able to edit your question (there's an _edit_ link below it) to confirm what calendar software you're using and whether this is on iOS or macOS and also what version?
