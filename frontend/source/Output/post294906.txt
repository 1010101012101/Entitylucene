Unable to install ipa file (debug) with iTunes <body> I created an ipa file of my application to test it on a real device, but I'm not able to install it.  I used a developmet certificate and in the related provisioning file I added the target iPhone (using its own UDID). I use iTunes to install it, but I only see the icon appears and the disappears. Why? What can I check to make it work as expected?  I already done this operation in the past, but now I can't get out of this problem. DO you need more info to help me?   <comment372187> Yes. More info is needed. Side loading implies a jailbreak normally, but p reaps there was a but in the past on older iOS and iTunes that allowed that. What build of iOS and why not load the ipa via Xcode or TestFlight? <comment372201> Because I already did this... do you think it is a bad practice using iTunes with this aim? <comment372400> If you want to test the ipa you can drag it into the application list in the Xcode devices pane. You'll get a more useful explanation of what's wrong with the ipa that way
