Documents on iCloud which I can not access or delete <body> I have used to sync codeDocuments/code and codeDesktop/code to iCloud but my iCloud storage got to tight. So I moved my documents out of the codeDocuments/code and codeDesktop/code folder but the space on iCloud was not released. I can not acces it on iCloud to free it, if I enable sync again, nothing get's synched to my Mac. Do I effectively have 65GB dead space on my iCloud.  See the two screenshots for clarification.  Any suggestions how I can free these 68 GB?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6jmZM.png" alt="Info on iPhone" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EUEKC.png" alt="iCloud preferences on Mac" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lhRMf.png" alt="also in Mac"
