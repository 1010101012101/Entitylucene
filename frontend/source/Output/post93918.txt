ssh publickey error <body> I have a MBP with 10.8.4 and a Mac minis server with 10.8.4. I set sshd to only allow publickey and it worked.  But now, I’m now sure why, it doesn’t work anymore. I always get      publickey,gssapi-keyex,gssapi-with-mic   I think, I not change anything. permissons seems right.  <answer93919> Have you edited/checked   precodesudo vi /etc/ssd_config  /code/pre  for the GSSAPI options?  Same for your local ~/.ssh/config  precodeGSSAPIAuthentication=no /code/pre
