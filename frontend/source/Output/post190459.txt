Mouse scrolling speed setup on Mac <body> I do two tests - I rotate the scroll wheel on my mouse the same angle very slowly and very quickly. On Mac when I rotate the wheel very slowly it scrolls on the same webpage say 1 line. When I scroll the same angle in max speed it scrolls 1 page. Why the scroll is not consistent on the mouse and how can I fix this?  <answer190481> I believe that is by design. The Apple mouse wheel scroll settings are not designed to be proportional like they are on Windows. Since I go back and forth between the two systems I find it a little disconcerting but I don't find it that much of an issue for me.  You sound like it is a bit of an issue for you. There may be a program that will allow you to change this behavior, but since I have never needed it I don't have a specific suggestion for you other than to have a search on macupdate.com  <answer190483> You can probably correct this by disabling the "scrolling inertia" option.  Go to strongSystem Preferences/strong  strongAccessibility/strong  strongMouse &amp; Trackpad/strong and under "Mouse Options" or "Trackpad Options" (try both) choose the "without inertia" option of scrolling.  I hope it helps, let me know ;)  <comment229796> Unfortunately, it works only for trackpad (this option was under `Trackpad Options`), not for mouse - at least for me. Any other suggestions?
