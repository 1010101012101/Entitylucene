Is it possible to set a http proxy & port on a iOS personal hotspot connection <body> When an iPhone is connected to a Wifi network, there is an option to set a manual http proxy and port.  When user has created an personal WIFI hotspot ( sharing the cellular connection) there is no user setting where I can setup a manual http proxy/port for the WIFI hotspots connection, or ( at least for my cellular data network ) for setting the http proxy/port of the cellular connection.    I want http from devices connected to the hotspot to be routed to an http proxy/port.   Is there a way , perhaps by installing a profile, that I can achieve this?
