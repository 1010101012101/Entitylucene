Unresponsive Macbook Pro. Black Screen. Can't Reboot <body> The other day my MacBook Pro just spontaneously halted during regular usage.br  The screen went black, aside from the mouse cursor appearing once every 10 seconds (exactly).   I don't seem to be able to move the cursor myself and upon trying to reboot the device (cold), I get the Apple Inc. logo / loading progress-bar combo, and then its straight back to being an unresponsive black screen with a cursor that flashes at ten second intervals.  Does anybody understand what's going on and/or how to fix the problem so that I can resume normal operation? Cheers.  hr  Hardware:   ul liMacBook Pro./li li15" Retina Display./li liEarly 2013./li lii7 Processor./li liOS X Yosemite./li li8GB RAM./li li500GB Solid-State Storage.  hr/li /ul  Update:  SMC reset worked, but no change. NVRAM reset worked, i think (had to type firmware password) but it brought me to the recovery tools. Cannot boot into Safe-Mode or Single-User-Mode. Apple Diagnostics / Apple Hardware Test fails to launch. Recovery-Mode start-up brings me to the same screen as the NVRAM reset. Verbose-Mode also fails.  <comment301063> Have you tried resetting the NVRAM, SMC?  Can you boot into safe mode? <comment301076> @Allan Nope. None of those help. SMC reset worked, but no change.

Can you boot from a USB or DVD installer? <comment301098> I would say so, I haven't tried. Is that relevant? I will check. I'll try and boot a live Debian distro off a thumb-drive. <comment301130> It removes your internal SSD from the equation.  If you can't boot off the USB or DVD, you have (most likely) logic board issues.
