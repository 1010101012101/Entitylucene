MacBook Air Speaker Quality <body> I have recently purchased a MacBook Air and the speakers sound tiny. Does anyone know how many watts the speakers in the 2011 Macbook Airs have?  <answer25673> The simple answer is - not many.  The iFixit teardown of an earlier model (mid-2010) suggests 1-2 watts. The teardown of the 2011 model says nothing has changed since then.  <comment29111> Would that be "tinny", not "tiny"? <comment29122> I'm inclined to agree. I think finding the real value may be quite challenging. 1.5-3 watts seems like a good ballpark figure. And really, would it matter if it was a couple watts more? <comment29144> The number of watts is irrelevant here.  The size of the speaker is the limiting factor and given the size of the MacBook Air, it shouldn't be a surprise you're not getting "big" sound. <comment36315> My 2011 air is quite loud. Lounder than my all previous notebooks really.
