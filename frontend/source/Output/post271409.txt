Three-finger tap lookup across apostrophes <body> When I three-finger tap on a word with an apostrophe, like "they're", it only selects "they" or "re".  Is there a way to make it select and look up the full "they're", without having to select the word with one-finger drag or double click anyways?  <comment341193> Nope. I've never been able to change this behaviour, either. Maddening.
