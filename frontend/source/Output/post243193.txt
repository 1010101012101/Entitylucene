Reverse sorting order in Photos app on Mac OS X <body> the Photos app on Mac is really nice, but it shows the oldest pictures first, so I have to scroll to the bottom each time I open it... and I have lots of pictures.  So my question is: How can I reverse this order and see the newest pictures first? And can I do that across all platforms?  Thanks anyway!  <answer243199> According to Apple Communities that is not possible as of August 2015.  <comment299437> http://www.apple.com/feedback/macosx.html
