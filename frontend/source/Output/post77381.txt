How to serve the personal website from different folder? <body> So far, I read on MacRumors of:     h3System-wide site/h3      Files at code/Library/WebServer/Documents/code will, by default, be shared as the root Web site when Web sharing is turned on. These files can be accessed at codehttp://localhost//code or codehttp://&lt;yourIPaddress&gt;/code.      h3User-specific sites/h3      Files at code~/Sites/code, or in your home folder's Sites folder, are considered your user-specific site files. Each user by default has one of these folders. Each user's site can be accessed at codehttp://&lt;yourIPaddress&gt;/~(shortusername)/code.   It's all depicted when activating Web Sharing:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YMGMs.png" alt="Web Sharing"  But my static files are in a different folder, so I would like to serve them from code~/Projects/js-spa/code instead of from code~/Sites/code, but reading about configuring Apache, I can't find code/etc/httpd/httpd.conf/code on Lion.  How can I configure where do I want to serve the personal website from?  <answer77385> If you're up for it, httpd.conf should be in /etc/apache2/ on Lion/ML. Some mac-centred help is at this blog.  Have a look at "How to turn Mac OS X Lion into a web server?" for instructions on the Web Sharing pane, and doing similar things in Terminal under Mountain Lion.  <answer77430> As Cathy mentioned, you can accomplish this in Lion/Mountain Lion in just 3 easy steps:  ol liopen code/etc/apache2/httpd.conf/code in your favourite editor (codesudo/code it)/li lisearch for   ul licodeDocumentRoot "/Library/WebServer/Documents"/code and /li licode&lt;Directory "/Library/WebServer/Documents"&gt;/code   /li /ul  and replace code/Library/WebServer/Documents/code with the path you want Apache to serve for emlocalhost/em, e.g., code/Users/&lt;username&gt;/Projects/code/li lirestart Apache: codesudo apachectl restart/code/li /ol  <comment89687> If you're up for it, httpd.conf should be in /etc/apache2/ on Lion/ML
