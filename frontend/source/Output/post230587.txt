How to confirm Finder's rename prompt using the keyboard? <body> Using the keyboard, how can I confirm the rename prompt from Finder?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sKmH1.png" alt="enter image description here"  If I press kbdreturn/kbd/kbdenter/kbd the “Keep .doc” option is selected. Using the keyboard arrows kbd←/kbd, kbd↑/kbd, kbd→/kbd and kbd↓/kbd doesn't seems to help. Neither the kbdtab/kbd key.  <answer230588> Press kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdF7/kbd to enable all controls for kbdTab/kbd key and use it to switch the active button in application dialogs.  This can also be set in System Preferences - Keyboard - Shortcuts.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/exrmI.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment281568> Not sure if I have this option turned on but if I press the COMMAND key and the first letter of the button text it selects that button. <comment281619> @SteveChambers How does your comment relate to this answer? <comment281816> In the question pressing COMMAND-U will confirm it <comment281817> I have not written anything about Command-U and I don't think it is necessary in the method I described, thus I still don't understand, why do you write it as a comment under my answer.
