Resize Boot Camp partition <body> I installed Windows 8 on my MacBook Pro using Boot Camp. Now I've figured out I should have made the Windows 8 partition bigger. Is this safe to attempt using Disk Utility? If not, how do I go about accomplishing this?  <answer93806> For all my partitioning, I use and recommend strongiPartition/strong.     You can use iPartition on drives that contain Boot Camp volumes; in fact, you can even resize your Windows partitions, and let iPartition take care of reconfiguring the Windows boot process for you.   <answer286485> Though grgarside's answer was the correct &amp; only correct answer at the time, iPartition is no longer the 'go to' app for this kind of task. It has unfortunately been left to languish &amp; can't handle CoreStorage volumes at all.  The only replacement - &amp; actually improvement - on iPartition is now strongParagon Hard Disk Manager/strong  It can not only resize Bootcamp partitions, it can fix them &amp; even back up or move them to a new drive without breaking anything else in the process.

Definitely have a backup ready and waiting (although you should anyway, and resizing partitions is always somewhat dangerous). Do NOT under any circumstances resize from within Windows, as this WILL kill everything.
