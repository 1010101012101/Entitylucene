How can I operate "Find & Replace" using only the keyboard in Pages for OS X? <body> When I have clicked kbdTab/kbd to highlight the strongReplace All/strong button, kbdEnter/kbd doesn't do anything. Do I absolutely have to use the mouse for this?   It's inefficient to move between the keyboard and mouse when carrying out a long sequence of "Find &amp; Replace" actions.  This is Pages 5.0 (1465) running on Yosemite.  <answer250324> Use the Spacebar kbdSpace/kbd to click the selected button (not the Enter key kbdEnter/kbd). That should do it for you.  (Note to editors: I want to have the word "Spacebar" in there in case someone searches for it.)  <comment310781> As far as I know "clicking" the highlighted button is perormed with the Space Bar not the Enter key.
