RStudio Server Initialization Error on Mac El Capitan <body> I have installed RStudio Server using Homebrew on a Mac Pro Server with El Capitan. Then I followed instructions in the INSTALL file. When I launch RStudio Server from the host computer (http://localhost:8787) or remotely, it accepts my username and password but then I get this error:  "RStudio Initialization Error: Unable to connect to service". This seems to be common with Linux installs, but none of those posted solutions solve the problem on my Mac. I tried logging in as different users and administrators but I the same error message either way.  <answer257810> Solved - there was an error in my .plist file  <comment321872> Did you check `brew info rstudio-server`? <comment322105> Welcome to Ask Different.
