Recover photos from the iTunes backup of a dead iPhone <body> My wife's iPhone 4 just died: it won't turn on and doesn't charge. It's basically a brick right now. She needs to recover the photos on it. Is there any way to recover this from the iTunes backup files?  <answer171807> If you have backed up to your computer previously, you can use iExplorer to do that sort of thing.  http://www.macroplant.com/iexplorer/  <answer171833> If the backup is on a Mac then the free/donationware iPhone/iPod Touch Backup Extractor can help you with this.  ol liDownload and extract the application./li liClick "Read Backups" and it should give you a list of available device backups with time stamps of the last time they were backed up./li liSelect your wife's backup and click "Choose"./li liSelect "iOS Files" and click "Extract"./li liYou'll be prompted for a place to save the extracted files. Select one and click "Extract here"./li liOnce the extract is complete a Finder window should pop up. Open the folders Media, then DCIM and you should find your wife's photos in one or more folders called things like 100APPLE./li /ol  <comment202170> back up as iCloud back up? <comment202172> Nope, just when connecting the phone to the mac. <comment202173> Actually I'm not 100% sure she was using iCloud... <comment202174> easy, just ask her for log in information in to iCloud. <comment202175> Just checked the iCloud account (we use the same). No photos there, just pages, numbers, and stuff like that. <comment202178> bad luck, then the Photos sharing was not set up for iCloud. I do not know what "passed away" means but plugging it in to your Mac and using iTunes might do something or not. <comment202179> I clarified my question <comment202182> we shall call it RIP then :(
