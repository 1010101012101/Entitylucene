How can I use a USBC DisplayPort monitor with my 12” MacBook and charge at the same time? <body> I was hoping to get an Asus MB169C+ monitor to increase my screen real estate while traveling and working on my 12” MacBook.  However, I'm confused as to how I can charge my MacBook and use the display at the same time? I expect to have it setup for extended periods while traveling and would prefer not to run everything off the battery whenever I want to use the monitor.  Is this even possible? It seems like I would need some way of splitting power and also the usbc to DisplayPort connection, but continually more concerned at how limiting this single port system is.  <answer263257> If you intend to use the Asus MB169C+ while also charging your MacBook, you will need an adaptor, hub, dock, etc.  Here are some examples for you:  ul liHub+/li liKadi Port/li liArc Hub/li /ul  strongNOTE:/strong I have not used any of these personally - I have linked to them just to provide some examples of how you can achieve what you want. However, there are many products that will meet your needs varying from cheap to expensive.  <comment329826> Ok so I suppose that is the solution although at this point only one of those devices (the Kadi Port) is shipping, and I'd have to find out if DisplayPort functionality is maintained through the hub. Perhaps it's indeed a matter of waiting until these hubs become more ubiquitous. <comment329843> Yes, if you intend to still go with the Asus MB169C+. Basically there are lots of options for you if you're using a display with a typical 'display' connection (e.g. HDMI, Thunderbolt, etc). In your case you'd have to make sure any adapter, hub, etc has a USB-C port supporting “DP Alt Mode” or “DisplayPort over USB-C” capability, and that it **also** provides power capability so the Asus MB169C+ can power up!
