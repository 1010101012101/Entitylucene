Latest OSX for an early 2009 white macbook? <body> This is actually my second post on this topic:  Reviving white macbook (Early 2009)  The results from the first question were great and extended the life of my MacBook another few years.  My previous action was to replace the hard drive with an SSD and to downgrade OSX to the base version that came with the laptop.  While this was effective I am a bit nervous that it is also risky to run such an old OS and use it on the internet.  I am looking for advice on how well this laptop could run the latest and greatest OSX.  I think at minimum it would require a RAM upgrade.  Just curious if anyone has done something similar and can advise me.  First-hand or similar experiences would be great.  Thanks!  Here's the hardware from the original post:  Hardware:  Model Name: MacBook Model Identifier: MacBook5,2 Processor Name: Intel Core 2 Duo Processor Speed: 2 GHz Number of Processors: 1 Total Number of Cores: 2 L2 Cache: 3 MB Memory: 2 GB Bus Speed: 1.07 GHz Boot ROM Version: MB52.0088.B05 SMC Version (system): 1.38f5 Serial Number (system): W89064CJ4R1 Hardware UUID: F898BAE6-8231-55EE-9CE8-604194507E5A Sudden Motion Sensor: State: Enabled  <comment303550> Your MacBook is technically capable of running the current latest release of OS X El Capitan (10.11.5) however will not officially support the upcoming macOS Sierra (10.12). How well your system will run OS X El Capitan (10.11.5) is really up to you to decide by actually using it, not depending on what others have to say! If you do plan on running OS X El Capitan, then upgrading the RAM is highly recommended to improve performance over the 2 GB you have installed. <comment348920> I've been using one with El Capitan for a year or so.  I replaced the HD it came with about a year ago.  It came with 2GB and I upgraded that to 4GB a few years ago.
