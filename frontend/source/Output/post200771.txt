Any way to ascertain iOS version of locked iPad? <body> My iPad is 'disabled' and I need to know which version of iOS 8 it's running.  It's in the "iPad is disabled, connect to iTunes" state.  If I connect it to iTunes, it says "to allow access, please respond on ipad", but the ipad just says "connect to itunes."  <comment242114> First make sure you have the latest iTunes. iPad will be restored to the current iOS
