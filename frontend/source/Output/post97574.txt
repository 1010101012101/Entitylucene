Compiling a gimp plugin <body> I wish to compile the Gimp plugin  "Save for Web"  on Mac 10.8.4. I use  brew  for package management but libgimp2-dev is missing. I've downloaded Gimp 2.8.6 from  here . I've downloaded the latest source cd into that directory, but when I run code./configure/code I get the error of package requirements not being met em(gimp-2.0|gimpui-2.0 needs to be greater than 2.3 / gimp-2.0|gimpui-2.0 not found)/em   <comment114515> did you try not using brew for installation ? <comment114536> I searched but didn't find relevant packages. What do you have in mind? <comment114709> It appears homebrew isn't going to have gimp in it's repo any time soon: https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/pull/8835 <comment204984> Have you managed so sort it out? There are now native several Gimp versions for OS X. I am using the `brew cask install gimp` and I was interested about the same missing plugin. <comment205037> Yes, but not as per my original question. I've forgotten I posted this. Turns out the gimp.lisanet.de maintains a version of gimp that has the "Save for Web" functionality. Thanks to your asking, I see my version is outdated.
