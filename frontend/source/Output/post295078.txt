macOS failing to load bundled apps - "Compiler encountered an internal error" <body> My Macbook Pro is booting, but certain bundled apps - like Activity Monitor, Keychain Access - won't run. It's not limited to internal apps; some downloaded apps (e.g. AppCleaner) won't work either. The apps try to start, their icon bounces in the dock, but nothing else happens.  I only discovered this because SpringBoot in the ios simulator stopped working. Many of my apps work fine. Some others, such as Digital Color Meter, will load - but take more than 30 seconds to do so, and then crash sporadically.  Running them from the command line, e.g. code/Applications/Utilities/Activity\ Monitor.app/Contents/MacOS/Activity\ Monitor/code gives me the following clue:  code 2017-08-13 16:34:28.175 Activity Monitor[6657:32389] Metal pipeline state creation failed with error: Error Domain=CompilerError Code=1 "Compiler encountered an internal error" UserInfo={NSLocalizedDescription=Compiler encountered an internal error} /code  Any solutions - or any ideas where I should look next? Running Sierra 10.12.6 on an early 2013 Macbook Pro.  <comment372453> Sounds like there are some issues with the graphics driver. I'd recommend you try and reinstall and see if it persists? <comment372478> Yeah, that was going to be my next step. Have done a reinstall and that seems to have fixed it. Seems odd though.
