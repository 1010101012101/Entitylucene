Convert dynamic content to static in Numbers <body> I have used some formulas in codeNumbers/code and I would like to change the dynamic values to static ones, so I can copy them to different sheets, without having any reference errors.  Does anybody know how to do that?  <answer278383> Select and copy the source cells, then hit kbd⇧⌘V/kbd, which is the default shortcut for the strongEdit » Paste Formula Results/strong menu command.  (I assume that by emdynamic value,/em you are referring to the strongthe result of the calculation of an entire formula/strong and not to the individual cell references you are using as part of the formula’s expression. Feel free to update and clarify your question if you disagree.)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tzoa1.png" alt="Screenshot of the menu command Edit » Paste Formula Results"  If you want the static results to persist in your original cells as well, just hit kbd⌘C/kbd kbd⇧⌘V/kbd to paste the results in place.  <comment350323> (+1) This is exactly what I was looking for!
