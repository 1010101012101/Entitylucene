Any chflag for files in Notification Center? <body> I would like to have a list of TODOs in a particular folder (tex files) in the notification centre (the one in the right upper corner which opens from the corner).  Notification Center is the one at the top right  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z9m91.png" alt="enter image description here"  where I want to get notifications of the tasks which I mark in my files.  I want to communicate with the center to get alerts.  I am not sure if this is possible.  strongExample of tex file/strong  precode\documentclass{article} ...  % TODO note this for the exam and improve the figure Lorem ipsun.  /code/pre  Intuitively, it would be great if I can type in terminal  precodechflags showNotificationCenter TODO **/*.tex /code/pre  to show TODOs of specific files in the alarm center.  strongIs there any function to show those Tex-files' TODOs in Notification Center?/strong  <comment177222> I looked at this question a couple of times, but it is not clear to me what you exactly want. <comment177283> @CousinCocaine I added a picture with explanation what is Notification Center and what I want.
