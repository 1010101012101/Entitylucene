Search for emails from not a particular user or subject in Apple Mail <body> I am using Apples's Mail application for a while.  I know that to search for mails from a particular user, I need to use   precodefrom: abc@gmail.com /code/pre  But I need to search for emails that are not from a particular user or has a particular subject. strongBasically a negative/negated search./strong   I tried below search queries using boolean operation, but these didn't work.  precode NOT from: abc@gmail.com   NOT subject: Hello World /code/pre  Any help on this will be appreciated.  <answer226085> Mail can perform Boolean searches, but only in message contents, not in headers (such as Subject, From, or Date).  When using Boolean operators, always use uppercase — AND, OR, and NOT — so Mail doesn’t search for the actual words and, or, and not. You can use a minus sign (-) as a shortcut for AND NOT, so, if you type Jack -Jill in the Search field, you’ll see a list of all the messages that contain “Jack” but not “Jill.”  UPD. I've tried with my own mails and it looks like Mail DOES sort headers too. So try to enter into search field: abc NOT whatever-you-want-to-exclude. Shall work.

I heavily sort my mail on the way in, using about 20 different rules, so I'm unlikely to not know where to start looking later. I'd really be tempted to rule-move abc@gmail.com to another folder, then your search can be honed within your regular Inbox.
