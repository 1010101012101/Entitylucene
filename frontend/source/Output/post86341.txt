Apple Discussions website not responding to clicks? <body> This is ironic, Apple's Discussions website is not working properly in the latest version of Safari (6.0.3) or Chrome (25).  Any link or button that I click on the page does not work.  Is this happening to anyone else? I've restarted each browser.  <answer86343> Disabling JavaScript in Safari solved the issue:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fyquD.png" alt="enter image description here"  It seems that Apple have stronga bug in the JavaScript code/strong on their page.  br  Update â€” now it seems they are down for maintenance:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0UY8m.gif" alt="enter image description here"  <comment99735> you crack me up :)
