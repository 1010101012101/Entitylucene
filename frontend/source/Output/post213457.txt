How useful is it to buy an Apple TV to be used in India? <body> I live in India and love to use Apple products. Besides disabled Apple-TV features like Siri (available only in 8 out of 80 launch countries), many streaming services are not available outside the US. Some devices are not so useful outside their intended ecosystems, is Apple TV one of them?
