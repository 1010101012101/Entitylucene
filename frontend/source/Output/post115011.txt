Web page not updated <body> I have set my php web server following this guide: https://discussions.apple.com/docs/DOC-3083  If I load the page writing /index.html I see the page, I read "it works!". But if I edit the index.html file (in ~/Sites), I don't see the edit when I reload the page. For instance if I change it to say "Hello", I still see "it works!". I guess the page is cached somewhere, how do I realod it?
