Wrong email address in Pinterest <body> I received a iPhone 6 for Christmas.  I downloaded Pinterest to my new phone but apparently I used the wrong email address because all of my saved pins are not there.  With my android phone all I had to do was to delete the app from my phone and then re-add it.   I have tried this but it is saved in the iCloud.  So how do I remove this app and download it using the right email.  <comment338550> is there no place in the pinterest settings that will let you log out and log in with a different email address?
