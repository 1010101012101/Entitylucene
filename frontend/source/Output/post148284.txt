No access privileges after new setup via Terminal commands OSX 10.5.8 <body> I have an old G5 Mac running OSX 10.5.8 (leopard)and I had forgotten my admin password. I used some excellent terminal commands I found at Ask Different to Reset the initial setup. I used a different name after the reboot just in case of a problemâ€¦ The drama I have now after I have the new account is, I have no access privileges to my music and movie library. I know all the files are there because of the correct size of data in the main drive. I just can't see them, let alone access them any more. Any ideas?  <comment174722> Check out the `sudo` and `chown` commands.
