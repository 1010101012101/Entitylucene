Applescript applets - can I make an applet immediately if it is already running? <body> If I make Applet Zed, I can open it again and again with multiple copies running. Can I change this behavior before saving the applet? If not, is there script that can detect the first occurrence and immediately close the second applet? I tried to immediately quit the second applet if it detected an active process named Zed, but nothing I tried worked. I tried using an if-then statement to skip past all the applet code if Zed was running. That didn't work either, which makes no sense because Zed was in the list of processes.  <comment291144> Can you paste the code please? <comment292120> This is not code-specific. Launch any applet that runs continuously (typically with an "on idle" script). Launch the applet again, and you’ll get a second running applet. This behavior is seen in some applications such as BBEdit. Since other applications don’t allow another copy of the application to launch, I assume there is some code run at launch that prevents it. I'm hoping for something similar for AppleScript applets.
