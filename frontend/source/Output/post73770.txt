Does iOS report usage in megabytes or mebibytes? <body> When looking at usage stats in iOS (data sent/received), are the megabytes/gigabytes in base-10 or base-2?  The docs are not entirely conclusive (since it doesn't address usage specifically) but suggests base-2 is used for iOS device capacities.  So which is it?  <answer73771> I wasn't able to find conclusive documentation on this so I tested it. strongI found that iOS uses the base-10 definition/strong when showing usage.   That is, if you send a large file, say 10 mebibytes (10 Ã— 2sup20/sup, or 10485760 bytes), it will report it in megabytes, counting a megabyte as 1,000,000 bytes (not 1,048,576 bytes).  So that 10 MB, shows up as 10.4 MB:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fNJGb.png" alt="10mb usage"  (I'm emnot/em suggesting that there's anything nefarious going on here related to billing or data limits.)
