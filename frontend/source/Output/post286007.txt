Apple ball speakers connect to MacBookPro? <body> Is there a way to connect my apple ball speakers to my MacBookPro? The speakers have a 2.5mm jack but the MacBook Pro has a USB port. Thanks!  <answer286010> If your speakers have 2.5mm you'll need to buy 2.5mm - 3.5mm adapter (like this) to connect it with MacBook Pro  <answer286015> You need a USB DAC (Digital Audio Converter).  I personally use a Behringer UCA202 to connect my iMac to my Bose Wave Radio.    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hQXFvm.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FQErjm.png" alt="enter image description here"  What's really nice about it is that it's powered off the USB port meaning it doesn't need an external power adapter.  It also has both left and right inputs and outputs as well as a 3.5mm headphone connection.    For best quality, you will want to use the RCA output.  You will just need an RCA to 3.5mm adapter (upper right picture) to connect to your speakers.
