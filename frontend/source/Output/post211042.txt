Startup Script Removal <body> Is there a good way to remove a script that was set to run at startup on a 10.10.5 macbook, that fails and never runs to completion?  If the Script could complete normally it would remove itself, however the error it encounters is not allowing it to finish.  <comment254771> Run the commands manually that the script would run if it completed successfully? <comment254772> I dont have access to the script that is running. It was installed as a part of the image to run on startup to Bind the macbooks to a server. This is no longer used, and while it ran fine on 10.10.3, once it got updated, there is an issue with the script completing on 10.10.5 and it will not complete. I want to just be able to remove that script from startup, so it wont run at all. <comment258495> FYI - I was finally able to find the location of the Script that was executing at boot up. It was in /usr/local/bin. Since it was a self destructing script and the error it was encountering was not allowing it to complete and remove itself. I was able to simply delete the folder with the script at that location and this resolved the situation.
