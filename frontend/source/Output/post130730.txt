How can I keep keybindings of iTerm and vim apart <body> h11.Enviroment/h1  Env: vim+zsh+iTerm2 on Mac OSX 10.9.2. (Same problems in vim+terminal+bash on Mac OSX 10.9.2)  h12. Mapping Problems/h1  Here are mapping problems list(You can chose any of them to anwser).  My vim could not get some shortcuts: code&lt;A-Left|Right|..&gt;/code,code&lt;D-char&gt;/code.  h22.1 code&lt;A-Left|Right|UP|Down/code/h2  In iTerm2 , hitting code&lt;A-Left|.../code will result in(iTerm2 doesn't bind any shortcut for them.):  precode&lt;A-Up&gt; print 'A' with a sound alert. &lt;A-Down&gt; print 'B' with a sound alert. &lt;A-Left&gt; print 'D' with a sound alert. &lt;A-Down&gt; print 'C' with a sound alert. /code/pre  In vim, code&lt;A-Left|.../code behave same as code&lt;Left&gt;&lt;Right&gt;&lt;Up&gt;&lt;Down&gt;/code in insert mode , normal mode, visual mdoe  and Ex Mode, etc. strongCould I map them code&lt;A-Left|..&gt;/code/strong?  h22.2 code&lt;D-char&gt;/code/h2  Some keys about code&lt;D-char&gt;/code are iTerms's own hotkeys, such as :  ol licode&lt;D-q&gt;/code will quit iTerm2/li licode&lt;D-w&gt;/code will close current tab in iTerm2/li /ol  strongOn the other hand, the other keys such as code&lt;D-s&gt;/code are not hotkey, and do not print any char in vim and terminal. Is it possible to map them in vim?/strong  <comment153356> This site works better if there is only one problem per question. Can you please either generalize your problem (e.g. "How can I keep keybindings of iTerm and vim apart") or focus on one of the questions you have here (and ask others for the rest)? <comment153374> @patrix Following your suggestion, I've cutted my problems to three parts: 1. **How to keep keybindings of iTerm and vim apart**. 2. **How map `C-A-char`**. 3. **Mapping problem about `C-q` in terminal**
