From your answer, you have installed the syntax file in code/usr/share/vim/code, which is system class directory. This is not recommended since this can be erased on system or application update, and you don't know what your modification might conflict with. Instead, you should put all your vim configuration files under your home directory in code~/.vim/code.  (Sorry if it isn't a proper answer to your problem, but it seems I can't add comment to already posted answers)  <comment83518> which exactly i already did <comment284642> It seems to me what you did is quite a different approach: directly modifying the system version of the file in `/usr/share/vim`. Please reread my answer to understand why it is not the proper way to override the default syntax file.  If you look a possibly up to date syntax file, I suggest you take a look at [StanAngeloff's php syntax plugin](https://github.com/StanAngeloff/php.vim) (or better, if you use many languages: the [vim-polyglot plugin](https://github.com/sheerun/vim-polyglot)).
