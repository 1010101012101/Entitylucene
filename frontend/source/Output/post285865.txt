How to recover a corrupted external exFAT hard drive <body> This is a 3 TB external Seagate hard drive formatted in Mac's Disk Utility as a single non bootable exFAT partition. It got unplugged from the computer and now the computer is unable to read it.  codesudo gpt -r -vv show /dev/disk4/code:  precodegpt show: disk4: mediasize=3000592977920; sectorsize=4096; blocks=732566645 gpt show: disk4: PMBR at sector 0 gpt show: disk4: Pri GPT at sector 1 gpt show: disk4: Sec GPT at sector 732566644     start       size  index  contents         0          1         PMBR         1          1         Pri GPT header         2          4         Pri GPT table         6      76800      1  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B     76806        250     77056  732489472      2  GPT part - EBD0A0A2-B9E5-4433-87C0-68B6B72699C7 732566528        112 732566640          4         Sec GPT table 732566644          1         Sec GPT header /code/pre  Is it possible to recover the hard drive?  Update: I had to unplug and plug the external hard drive back in. It takes about 5 mins for computer to recognize the hard drive. The following screen pops up. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hi0sK.png" alt="enter image description here"  I ran the first aid from the disk utility app and the operation was successful but it still show the disk as uninitialized.  codediskutil list/code:  precode/dev/disk4 (external, physical): #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER 0:                GUID_partition_scheme               *3.0 TB     disk4 1:                        EFI EFI                      314.6 MB   disk4s1 2:       Microsoft Basic Data SEA_EXFAT                3.0 TB     disk4s2 /code/pre  The hard drive doesn't show up in finder.  codediskutil verifyVolume disk4s2/code:  precodeStarted file system verification on disk4s2 SEA_EXFAT Verifying file system File system check exit code is 1 Error: -69845: File system verify or repair failed Underlying error: 1: Operation not permitted /code/pre  <comment360670> @klanomath is the format correct? I'm new to this. <comment360672> Ok, I think I just messed it up. Do you think I can recover the hard drive? <comment360699> I'm unable to run verifyVolume. <comment360816> I've updated the command output. I don't know why the list command doesn't show the two partitions. <comment361151> @klanomath I finally was able to perform the `diskutil verifyVolume disk4s2` command. <comment361153> The partitions are there. One is the EFI system partition, and the other is your exFAT partition. <comment361154> The exFAT partition doesn't show up in Finder. I'm unable to access it. <comment361161> @klanomath I'm in the process of recovering some of the files using TestDisk. It's going very slow. I'll install TeamViewer after it's done. <comment361321> @klanomath I installed TeamViewer. What's your email address? <comment361323> @klanomath I emailed you with the TeamView id. Is that all you need? <comment361326> simply add a comment (at)klanomath after getting a new drive
