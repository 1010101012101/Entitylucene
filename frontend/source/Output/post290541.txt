Having trouble editing Finder settings using defaults write <body> I run the following command:  precodesudo defaults write ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist ShowHardDrivesOnDesktop -boolean TRUE /code/pre  in hopes that this will cause system hard drives to show on the desktop, which doesn't happen.  I kill all Finder processes and restart Finder, but no dice.    I try to open com.apple.finder.plist in Xcode, but it says I do not have permissions to view the file (I was able to before).  Shortly after, I am able to open it, but the file is empty.  The attributes are slowly regenerating.    What is happening here?  I am looking for a command to toggle the option to show hard drives on the desktop, just as if I checked the box in Finder preferences.  <answer290547> First of all you shouldn't need codesudo/code and it may have caused the permissions issue, and no need to use the full pathname, just:  precodedefaults write com.apple.finder ShowHardDrivesOnDesktop -boolean TRUE /code/pre  The following works for me, as is, in OS X 10.8.5 and macOS 10.12.5 in both a Standard and Admin Account in Terminal.  precodedefaults write com.apple.finder ShowHardDrivesOnDesktop -boolean TRUE; killall Finder /code/pre  Using codeFALSE/code, in place of codeTRUE/code hides the e.g. Macintosh HD on the Desktop.  I'd probably opt to either restore the file from a known good backup or delete the code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist/code file and then run codekillall Finder/code in Terminal, letting it rebuild and should resolve the permissions issue as well.  <comment366756> That worked for me.  I think my problem had to do with me using 'sudo' and running 'killall Finder' in a separate line, after the running Finder process already messed things up. <comment366760> @squarjn, Running `killall Finder` on a separate line should not be an issue, I just do it all on one line for efficiency. The real issue was you using `sudo`, as you shouldn't have in this use case.
