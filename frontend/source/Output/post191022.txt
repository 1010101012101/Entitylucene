Why is OS X giving me a warning about installing apps when I try to open an XML file with Webstorm? <body> I've extracted some XML files from an email attachment. I would like to open them in Webstorm instead of Xcode. But when I try to use the "Open With - Other" and pick Webstorm, I get a message about being unable to install the app. That doesn't make any sense, since xml files are just text. Screenshots:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qbSsz.png" alt="Open With..." img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eiw9Q.png" alt="Warning"  Are XML files somehow defined as apps by OS X? Is there a way to change that? Is this a bug?   I have verified that the file is just xml and it can be opened by WebStorm with no issues. This seems to be a Finder/security issue.   <answer191025> Open Terminal and type codexattr -rd com.apple.quarantine/code followed by a space, then drag the file or folder of files that you can't open directly into the Terminal window, and push return. You should now be able to open the file directly.  <comment226854> Which also begs the question: How do you sign an XML so that the OS identifies it as coming from an identified developer? Seems a bit odd. I'll post a workaround though. <comment226863> would I have to do that for every file? <comment226864> @jcollum if you have a bunch of files in a folder that need this, use the command `xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine`, then a space, but drag the folder in instead, and push return.
