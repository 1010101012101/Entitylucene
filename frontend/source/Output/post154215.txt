They also pop up in the middle of writing other words as well.How can i fix this. The o's run across the screen.  <answer154218> Sounds like the key contact is contaminated.  Simple starter options would be...  ul liSwitch off the machine./li liRepeatedly tap the key, 20 or more times, firmly but not too forcibly./li liTurn the machine vertically &amp; repeat./li liUse a can of compressed air to blow out any dust/bits from under the keys./li /ul  If still no joy, I'd recommend professional repair.  <comment181725> Thanks. I tried tapping the keys regularly and vertically with machine switched off. Going to buy condensed air today to see if that helps.
