Problems installing OS X El Capitan AND question regarding partitions <body> This is a repost since my last post wasn't clear enough. Apologies, it has been deleted. caution, long.  Here's a timeline of everything that has happened. I found my old macbook and decided to give it an upgrade. It was previously running SL on the primary partition and ML on secondary.  ol liI was using code.../createinstallmedia/code to create a bootable thumb drive of El Capitan for a new SSD but since both my thumb drive and the primary partition had the same name ("untitled"), the command wrote the installer over the primary partition (SL)./li liI used ML to boot up, purchased a recovery software and successfully strongsaved/strong all my important data which is as of now backed up on the other Mac. I posted a question on this site, regarding the findings of the software and was told it showed that directory structure was lost./li liI erased, and then deleted the primary partition. I then used Carbon Copy Cloner to clone my secondary partition to the new partition made with that empty space. strongquestion: Is this enough to make this replacement partition a primary one?/strong Asking since It was cloned. This partition is now bootable so I deleted the secondary partition. There is now only one partition on the MacBook, running Mountan Lion. The bootup is a bit noticeably slower. This is what the disk utility shows:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/G7IJi.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liI am trying to install OS X El Capitan from the .app file copied from my other MacBook but it shows the following error:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dj1Gm.png" alt="enter image description here"/li /ol  strongWhat is this error and how do I get rid of it?/strong   Note that my Mac is compatible with El Capitan.  Edit: This is the result of 'sudo gpt -r show disk0' in terminalimg src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hXUZt.png" alt="result"  <comment363554> @klanomath jesus fuck that was a lot of editing. I'm so sorry. <comment363555> You are either trying to launch "Install OS X El Capitan.app" from a mounted read-only image file (dmg) (or some uchg/lock flag is set). So copy the app to your /Applications folder and try to launch it there. <comment363556> "Primary partition" is Windows talk. You probably have three partitions (disk0s1 "EFI"; disk0s2 "Untitled 1" (that's your main volume with ML) and disk0s3 "Recovery HD"). Two of them are invisible (disk0s1/disk0s3), two of them are bootable  (disk0s2/disk0s3). <comment363559> @klanomath  okay noted. By primary partition, i meant the partition at the top. Since one increases partition size by dragging it down, it was not possible for me to increse the partition size of the second partition even though all the space above it was empty. After I used CCC, there was 1 extra recovery partition made. How do I delete that? <comment363561> Please add the output of `sudo gpt -r show disk0` entered in Terminal.app to your question. *"...even though all the space above it was empty..."*: you can't "forward expand" (= move the start block of a partition to lower block numbers) a partition with OS X tools. <comment363564> @klanomath done <comment363566> This is the standard partition layout for OS X (except that the recovery partition is a way too big (~784 MB=1531696 blocks instead of 650 MB) which is a typical result of using Carbon Copy Cloner)
