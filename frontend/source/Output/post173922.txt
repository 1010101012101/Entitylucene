Music library deleted from iPhone <body> I switched from the iPhone to a Samsung last May and today decided to charge my old phone to use it as a regular iPod. However, when I turned it on all of my music was gone. The computer I had it back up on crashed last year too so the music on my phone was the only copy. Any ideas on what happened or how I can recover it?  <answer173925> Apple doesn't back up music files as part of iOS backups since they either came from iTunes Match / iTunes in the Cloud or they came from a computer.  ul liYou should try a tool like PhoneView to see if the files are still on the storage and just the catalog has become missing or corrupt./li liYou could reconnect it to the computer that has the music./li liYou could reconnect it to the cloud music./li liYou could pursue data recovery on the device itself - that would likely be extremely expensive or you'd have to be very lucky and have the device jailbroken and no further usage of the storage since each time a new file gets written, it can and will over-write the music./li /ul  If the music was truly on the phone, then it would be best to get a quote from a data-recovery specialist and then see if you want to try DIY recovery and/or if it would be cheaper to get the music elsewhere.  <comment204696> Did you buy the music from iTunes? <comment204697> No. it was all music that I had downloaded onto the phone from my computer. Nothing bought or downloaded from iTunes itself <comment204698> The computer wouldn't have a backup copy of the music anyhow since iTunes doesn't back that up. I'll answer, but you likely have a hundreds of dollars recovery expense with poor chances of success. <comment204699> What happened to the music though? It was on there when I turned my phone off last may and I turn it on today and its gone. <comment204742> Why not try a tool like PhoneView to check if they are really missing? <comment204747> Did you sync it after turning it on?
