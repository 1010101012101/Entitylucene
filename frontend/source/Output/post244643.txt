Why can't I have unique sorting options for folders in Finder? <body> For example, when I set the Documents folder in my user folder to "Sort by: Kind", it also sets the sorting option for every other folder on my computer. Can I have unique folder sorting options? Or is it impossible?   EDIT: This is on El Capitan.  <answer244645> Indeed, unique sort order is possible.   ol liOpen a new Finder window for e.g. Documents and /li liGo to View  Show View Options or hit Command + J. /li liDefine your Sort order. That's it. Close the window/li liRepeat the step for every window. This way you can define the Sort order for every Finder window./li /ol  <answer244722> You said: â€œThere is no button labeled "Use As Defaults" on my version of OS X." But there is, or should be. Opene diskUtility, select your disk and hit the FirstAid tab: it will correct the permissions; then restart the mac. This will probably help.  <comment301501> For some reason, that doesn't work on my iMac. It just sets the same sorting options for every single folder on my computer. <comment301503> @lempamo do not hit the button "use as defaults". This will define the sort order to all folders. Simply close the view options window <comment301504> There is no button labeled "Use As Defaults" on my version of OS X. <comment301618> I have updated my previous answer. Be sure to open a new Finder window for every folder in order to define a unique sorting order.
