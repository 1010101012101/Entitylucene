Keyboard shortcut to switch to a specific Chrome window <body> Ok, I realize this is asking for the impossible. I habitually have about 4 Chrome windows open. On linux, I have a system set up so I have a different keyboard shortcut to switch to each window, so I can jump to the correct one really quickly.  Is there possibly a way to do this on OSX? I'm willing to write moderate amounts of code if necessary to implement this, 'though I should probably head over to StackOverflow if that looks like it will be needed.  <answer66543> precodetry     set text item delimiters to linefeed     tell application "Google Chrome"         reopen         do shell script "sort -n &lt;&lt;&lt; " &amp; quoted form of (id of windows as text) &amp; " | sed -n 3p"         set w to window id (result as integer)         set b to bounds of w         set t to title of w     end tell     tell application "System Events" to tell process "Google Chrome"         window 1 where position is {item 1 of b, item 2 of b} and title is t         perform action "AXRaise" of result         set frontmost to true     end tell end try /code/pre  Windows that were created later usually have a larger id. If the script is run when there's no second window, there won't be an error dialog because it's wrapped in a try block.  You can give the scripts shortcuts with FastScripts or by creating Automator services.  <comment78212> How would you identify the windows or decide which one to focus? Do you keep them on different spaces or something? <comment78283> No, not difference spaces. Some other attribute of the window might be possible, though, like the order in which they were created. That's the way it works on linux. <comment78305> How about creating a macro which would select the Window menu and then click at (X,Y) for the window you want? <comment79141> Thanks a ton! This is exactly what I wanted. I ended up calling out to a custom python script instead of using UNIX utilities, but this is pretty much what I'm now doing.
