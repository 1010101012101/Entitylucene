Sleeping on Macbook Pro, processes still active? <body> What processes run when El Capitan on a MBP is sleeping with powernap off? Is there a way to turn them off?  When I sleep my MBP, either via the main menu, closing the lid or kbdctrl/kbd + kbdpower/kbd, some system processes still seem to run. For example notifications will appear on top of the otherwise blank screen, or wifi will connect to new hotspots (In Starbucks when I open the lid there's already the wifi login screen open). I have Powernap turned off in system preferences. Sleep seems to act more like turning off the screen with kbdalt/kbd + kbdcmd/kbd + kbdpower/kbd.  Contrasting this to my old iMac, on sleeping I can hear the fans power down and nothing runs at all.
