External Drive Encrypted Journaled - Show Password Hint <body> I encrypted an external hard drive using MacOS Journaled Encrypted about a year ago. I'm confident that I was prompted to provide a password hint when I entered the original password and formatted the drive.  Now, when I connect the drive on a new computer running MacOS Sierra, I cannot get the password hint to show. Online pictures show a button on previous UIs but not on the current UI.  I contacted Apple and they sent the question to the engineers. They got back to me and said the engineers were aware of it, and it would be fixed in a future update.  I'm wondering if anyone here knows of another way to expose the password hint, maybe using a PC (doubtful) or Terminal. I'd like to access the hard drive and do not remember the password but am confident that the hint would help me.  <comment363442> There are password programs that store passwords - not that they will help you with this one but for the future.
