Siri is unable to hear me <body> I’m unable to use Siri on my MacBook Pro with macOS Siera 10.12.4. It says that there is some “Siri Audio Problem.”  The issue goes away when I restart my Mac, only to return after a very short time.  I have Dictation off.  Here is what it looks like:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Up4sy.jpg" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/X7GjQ.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment354732> Have you tested your microphone?  Does it work on Skype (or similar)?  Can you record sound?  Have you tried an external mic?  This will help you determine if this is a hardware or a software issue. <comment354880> I did not use external mic. On first screen, "input level" indicates that mic works fine. I suggest software issue because system reboot solves problem for a short time <comment366842> Here's the eternal question - have you tried rebooting your computer? <comment366847> I have exactly the same issue. Cannot use Siri at all on my MacBook Pro - fine on my desktop iMac. I have Skype and Slack installed on the MacBook, and they work fine. I can also answer phone calls from my iPhone with the MacBook, so no problems with the microphone there, at all. Except for Siri, who seems to be deaf. <comment366859> @Jackson1442, yes, I tried, and after reboot it worked fine for some time. Now I don't use Siri. No Siri - no problems :)
