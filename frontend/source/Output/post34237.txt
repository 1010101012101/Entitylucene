SSD upgrade and Lion <body> I have Lion installed in my system (macbook pro 17 mid 2010). I have also created a Lion DVD using a guide I've found while surfing the Internet. Tomorrow I will receive a ocz agility 3 240gb ssd drive. What is the best way to move all of my work to the new ssd drive? I am a developer and I have numerous ide installed (like netbeans) and servers like glassfish. It would be a complete disaster if I had to reinstall things, so I am wondering what is the best way to transfer the operating system and the installed applications easily. Thank you.  <answer34240> Superduper, if you can connect the SSD as an external HD before installing it.  <comment39063> This and an external SATA 2.5" drive enclosure.  On the software side, [Carbon Copy Cloner](http://www.bombich.com/) will also do the same job, but I am also a SuperDuper! user. <comment39064> Is it ok if I use time machine backup and then use migration assistant on the new ssd (after Lion installation)? <comment39067> You run higher risk. Sometimes restoring from Time Machine does not work (it happened to me). On the other hand I never heard of Superduper not working as advertised.
