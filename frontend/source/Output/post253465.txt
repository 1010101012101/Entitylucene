How do I make an appointment in the new iOS Apple Store app? <body> I remember this being fairly simple before the latest Apple Store app update. Just find your store and an option to make an appointment was right there but now I can't find it. Closest I've come is by going to the Account tab then reservations and finally I find my store in a list but I can't get any further.
