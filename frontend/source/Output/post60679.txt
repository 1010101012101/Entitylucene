How do I unlock my Mac without having to click my name? <body> In Snow Leopard, at least, I could press kbdCmd/kbd + kbdL/kbd to select my name and then press kbdEnter/kbd to get the password prompt, but I can't get that to work in Mountain Lion when I've left the computer locked for an extended amount of time.  How do I unlock my Mac without having to click my name when I've locked it?   <answer60682> Just by typing the first letters of the user's name should select that user. Afterwards, as you say, pressing kbdEnter/kbd will prompt for the password.  <answer60684> Also you can use the Arrow Keys kbd&larr;/kbd or kbd&rarr;/kbd to select the user name you want and then press kbdEnter/kbd to get the password prompt.  <answer60693> Actually, kbdCmd/kbd + kbdL/kbd still works too, but my problem seems to be that the keyboard is unresponsive after locking if the screensaver kicks in. For now, I'll up the time for the screensaver to kick in as per How can I set the Mac OS X screensaver when not logged in? and hope that Apple fixes this in a future update.  <comment69845> Thanks, that works well too! Sometimes it's not a good thing to be an advanced user - the simple things aren't as obvious when you're used to something more complicated...=) <comment70035> Yup, I've been doing that for years!
