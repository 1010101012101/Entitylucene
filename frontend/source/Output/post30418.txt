Can I customize the Command+Tab behaviour when switching between spaces in Lion? <body> As discussed in this question, when I'm switching between apps in different spaces, I need to hold down kbdOption/kbd so that the the correct app is shown.  I find this really annoying.  Is there a way to modfiy this behaviour, so that when I'm switching between apps, the app I'm after is always shown, regardless of the space that it's in?  <comment34909> I wasn't able to reproduce that behavior. I tried assigning the target app to a space and toggling *When switching to an application, switch to a space with open windows for the application*. Am I missing something?
