Text kerning in Keynote '09 running on El Capitan <body> I have noticed today that the text kerning in Keynote '09 (5.3) running on El Capitan is different from that in Keynote 6.6.2, and the former is very ugly.  You can easily see that the kerning between "T" and "e" is most clearly different, when Myriad Pro, which is not a system font, is used.  strongKeynote 6.6.2/strong img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2kSU0.png" alt="Keynote 6.6.2"  strongKeynote '09/strong img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dEXxy.png" alt="Keynote &#39;09"  Hiragino Sans, which is a system font from El Capitan, shows the same problem, while Gill Sans, Helvetica, and some other fonts do not.  Does anyone know how to fix this issue? Is this a font problem or an OS problem?
