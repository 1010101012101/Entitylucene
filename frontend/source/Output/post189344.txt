How to enable the sidebar in finder? <body> All out of a sudden, the sidebar in "Finder" is gone. The weird thing is that the "Show Sidebar" entry of the View menu is disabled/grayed out, so the sidebar can't be enabled again. Do you have any ideas how to fix this issue? Btw, restarting did not change anything.  Edit: Happens on OSX Yosemite/10.10.3  <answer189348> Carefully move the pointer to the left side of the finder window border till the cursor changes to arrow pointing to the right.  strongâ†¦/strong  Hold and Drag to the right.  If that did not work you need to restore the finders preferences.  In terminal run   precoderm ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.sidebarlists.plist /code/pre  and   precoderm ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist  /code/pre  Restart.  <comment224501> do you get this on every window?  for instance start opening the hard drive on desktop and see if it's still greyed out. <comment224503> Same behavior on every window. It seems like the sidebar is totally gone... <comment224509> Awesome! That fixed it! Thank you very much!
