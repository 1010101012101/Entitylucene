Bad CPU in Executable Trying to Install Ruby <body> I'm running Mountain Lion, and I'm trying to install Ruby; however, I get "bad CPU in executable" error.  Not sure how to fix this .  . . ideas?  Sorry for the bad formatting - "code" doesn't really format this Terminal output properly.  code [06:51 AM] ~ 2 $ curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current                                  Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed 100   185  100   185    0     0    293      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--   345 100  9979  100  9979    0     0  11662      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 11662 bash: line 30: /sw/bin/gtar: Bad CPU type in executable Downloading RVM from wayneeseguin branch stable   % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current                                  Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed 100   125  100   125    0     0    502      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--   531 100 1045k  100 1045k    0     0   925k      0  0:00:01  0:00:01 --:--:-- 1543k bash: line 161: /sw/bin/gtar: Bad CPU type in executable/code  <comment69594> Ruby already comes installed on OS X. <comment69606> +1 on "Ruby already ... installed".  On another note, the error is occurring with `/sw/bin/gtar`.  Did you recently upgrade? Do you have an old fink distribution installed? The script you are running is finding `gtar` but the call fails. <comment69607> If you really want this to run, you might try exporting `rvm_tar_command` explicitly before you run the script--i.e. `export rvm_tar_command=/usr/bin/tar`. <comment69618> The Apple version is 1.8.something. The most recent ruby version is 1.9.2. So, that's why I want to use THAT version.   I'll try that command when I get home - thanks. <comment69642> Okay . . . where do I put the export command in?  I put that in .profile, touched it and I'm still getting the bad CPU error with path set to /sw/bin/tar. <comment69644> Oh, yeah, and it looks like I have /sw/fink but I can't use FinkCommander that is in Applications as it isn't compatible with Mountain Lion, so not sure of best way to remove Fink. <comment69655> Okay . . . culprit was Fink.  Easily removed with: sudo rm -rf /sw <comment69677> Sounds like it.  The installer script was actually finding gnu tar in the incompatible sw dir.  Glad you removed it.
