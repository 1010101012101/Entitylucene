Configure keyboard combination to switch apps <body> kbdCommand-Tab/kbd displays app list to switch between them, well nice feature. But can I customise this keyboard combination to use a single key to accomplish application switching?  <answer132503> You may or may not like Witch: http://manytricks.com/witch/  <answer132527> I can only think of a way to do it with a single key if you enable the function keys to work without holding down fn.  Then you can assign one of the function keys (F1, F2 etc.) to "Move focus to next window".  First enable "Use all F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys like this: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XrZIc.png" alt="Use all F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys"  Then assign the "Move focus to next window" to one of the function keys like this: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5L7Jn.png" alt="Move focus to next window"  <comment156890> Customize to do what? <comment156892> Can you please clarify whether you want to change the shortcut to something else, change the way Cmd-Tab/app switching works or even something else? <comment156893> What u mean by Cmd? <comment156896> The Command key <comment156897> I want to assign some other key (preferably a single key) to do the same job instead of cmd+tab. <comment156919> Could you expand on how this answers the question? <comment156930> "Move focus to next window" isn't the same as ⌘⇥ which switches between apps? <comment293135> I'd like to do the same thing, but do not know how to do it. I have two applications, between which I want to switch often.
