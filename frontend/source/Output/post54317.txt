Which Personal Hotspot mode uses least battery? <body> Both iPad and iPhone's Personal Hotspot mode allows 3 ways to connect:  ul liWiFi/li liUSB cable/li liBluetooth/li /ul  I want to use Personal Hotspot on my MacBook Pro, this means that I can use either of the three. Therefore I was wondering:  strongWhich connection type uses the least battery of the device providing the Personal Hotspot service?/strong  <answer54321> USB tethering will use the least battery because the phone will charge while it acts as a hotspot. Bluetooth should be next (especially if both devices go into Bluetooth 4.0's low power mode), with WiFi last.  <answer54457> USB uses the least power by far, only one radio working, plus the phone may run cooler, some people have had heat issues with extensive WiFi/Bluetooth use.  I did an more complete comparison of all three types here: WiFi or Bluetooth (or USB) for iPad Tethering  "Bottom Line: USB is the best if range isn't an issue, If distance is needed use Wifi with WPA2"  Sources for heat issues:   https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2046464  http://forums.macrumors.com/archive/index.php/t-593613.html
