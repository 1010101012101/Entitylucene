Preventing MacBook from sleeping when closing lid on Sierra <body> Is there any way to prevent my MacBook Pro from sleeping when I close the lid on macOS Sierra? I used to use NoSleep on OS X El Capitan; unfortunately it stopped working properly after Yosemite and I've heard that on Sierra it causes problems, so I don't want to install it and potentially cause damage.  Does anyone use anything that they strongpersonally have used/strong that prevents MacBooks from going to sleep when the lid is closed strongon macOS Sierra/strong?  <answer256414> InsomniaX works perfectly on my MBP 13" 2015. I am using macOS Sierra 10.12.   There's also an app called NoSleep, but it hasn't been updated in years, only use it if you're on older OSX like Mavericks or Yosemite.. I wouldn't recommend using it on Sierra..  <answer272213> Use Caffeinatebr To begin running the caffeinate command and prevent your Mac from sleeping, open the Terminal located in /Applications/Utilities, then type the following command:  precodecaffeinate /code/pre  While this command is running, you will be able to close the lid on your Mac and still have OS X and your apps running and performing their tasks just as you would if the lid were to remain open.  <answer276007> I actually still use NoSleep on my macbook air 2011 running on OSX Sierra and it seems to work fine still :) Haven't tried putting it on a brand new macbook pro 13 (2016) also running Sierra yet though. No sleep version 1.4.0.  <comment319688> Plugged into an external monitor? <comment319690> @dstarh Oh yes, I forgot to mention: I don't have one at the moment so I'm looking for something more "software" related. Thanks for the suggestion though. <comment319792> I've used that one before, but wasn't sure whether it would be a good idea on Sierra. Thanks for confirming! <comment319830> why don't you want it to sleep? <comment319831> @OzzieSpin sometimes I have downloads and whatnot running, and I want to close it and put it somewhere <comment342138> Don't use NoSleep, I tried in mac os sierra with a MBA 13" late 2014 and it doesn't work. <comment342183> According to [this question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/219885/use-caffeinate-to-prevent-sleep-on-lid-close-on-battery), it doesn't seem to work. I tried it myself, and it didn't seem work for me. Does it work for you? <comment344842> Doesn't work for me either :( <comment347333> Wow, that's funny. It never seemed to work for me after El Capitan! I thought it was dead after that. I'd still advise anyone from using it as it hasn't been properly tested (and can be unreliable) on El Capitan or above. <comment348610> Does not work on a 2015 rMBP 15 with Sierra 10.12.3.  The icon has two shaded areas, a half moon and an eye.  On "Prevent Lid Sleep" the moon should become shaded.  It will not become shaded when I try to use it. <comment350895> Just to be on the safe side, don't use NoSleep on Sierra. It hasn't been updated in years.
