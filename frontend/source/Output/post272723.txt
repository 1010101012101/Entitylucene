Prevent iOS app from ringing like incoming call <body> I am using a 3rd-party messenger app for chatting. I don't want this app to notify me in any way, so I turned off all its notifications. When I open the app, I see everything I have missed, and it's good that way.  However, the app has a voice-call feature, and whenever someone clicks that button, my phone rings in the same way as if I am getting a phone call. How can I prevent the app from doing that? I don't want any sounds and I don't want the app to occupy the lock screen.
