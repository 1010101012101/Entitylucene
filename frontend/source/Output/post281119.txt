iPhone 6 WiFi Issue - Incorrect Password <body> Off lately my iPhone 6 starts prompting "Incorrect Password" error while connecting to Wifi, it happens every time it dies due to the low battery or is restarted. I have tried all the steps suggested on Apple Forum as well as various other sources. Reset Network Settings,Reset All Settings, Forced Restart, Forgetting network and trying to join again, Turning off the wifi assist and tried connecting to Wifi during Airplane mode, I have tried them all numerous times.  Once, it started working after resetting network settings. Second time, it worked after forced restart. Now it has started prompting the same error again,I have tried all possible things except just doing the factory reset this time.   Would appreciate if anyone has any other suggestions or recommendations to fix this issue.  <comment353857> Welcome to Ask Different! Some questions for you: (1) Is this happening with only one particular Wi-Fi network? Or is it happening with numerous Wi-Fi networks? (2) Did this behaviour co-incide with anything else you did, such as an iOS upgrade/update, a change in Wi-Fi network, a new router, etc? (3) Also, what happens when you get this error? Do you then enter the password and it connects fine, or do you find it just won't connect at all? (4) Finally, what version of iOS are you running? <comment353932> (1) It is happening with all Wi-Fi networks (2) Nope. Just phone dying due to low battery or whenever it is restarted. No change in any other parameters (3) It does not connect at all. (4) I was facing the issue on 10.2.1 and then upgraded it to 10.3 hoping that upgrade might help in finding resolution to the issue but all the attempts have been futile.
