How can I get Mail to open .ics invites with my Google Calendar? <body> Right now double-clicking the invite adds it to an iCloud calendar that I don't use, so I have to manually change calendars when I accept an invite.  <answer237300> I am researching this problem with how iPhones handle calendar invites defaulting to iCal instead of using my Google Calendar and found this easy fix.  <comment290567> Welcome to Ask Different!
