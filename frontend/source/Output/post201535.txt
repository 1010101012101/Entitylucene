type of emails from Contacts.app in AppleScript (on El Capitan) <body> I want to work with a list of all email addresses that appear in my address book. I thought I could simply codeset/code such a list with AppleScript, and use the elements, maybe after casting the references to strings, as this answer suggests. However, the code below runs into a casting error, with or without explicit casting (e.g. codeas string/code):     error "Can’t make «class az21» 1 of «class azf4» id   \"C74972A5-88D4-4B0F-8DEA-304914926EE6:ABPerson\" of application   \"Contacts\" into the expected type." number -1700 from «class az21» 1   of «class azf4» id "C74972A5-88D4-4B0F-8DEA-304914926EE6:ABPerson"   precodetell application "Contacts"     set allEmails to every email of every person end tell repeat with anEmail in allEmails     display dialog anEmail end repeat /code/pre  This problem, of course, also inhibits any more meaningful uses of the email addresses.  What is this about, and what is a workable way to collect and access all email addresses in my address book?  I am running Public Beta 5 of El Capitan, though I did not test whether the behavior is any different on older (= actual) releases.  <answer201537> strongallEmails/strong is a list that contains several lists, each sublist contains emails of a contact.  codeemail/code is an object, you need to get the codevalue/code of this object.  So, you need a loop for each list, and another loop for each value.  precodetell application "Contacts"     set myList to value of emails of people end tell repeat with aList in myList     repeat with anEmail in aList         display dialog anEmail     end repeat end repeat /code/pre
