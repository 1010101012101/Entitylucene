Phone shows 11 gb is used while only a little over 1 gb is used? <body> I added all up all of the usage data on my iphone 5s(16gb) and it came up to a little over 1gb, while it says 11 gb is used, with only 1.7 gb is free.  <answer176124> Without knowing precisely what you "added up" ("usage data" is more than a little vague), it's hard to say, but I suspect your numbers didn't account for things like:  ul lithe OS itself/li lithe size of each application/li lithe size of overhead in strongany/strong storage device, including flash memory/li /ul  No matter what, the 1.7Gb is going to be the most applicable answer.
