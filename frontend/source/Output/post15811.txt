How do I delete forward on a Macbook Pro? <body> I know this:  ul licodeFn/code + codebackspace/code - "del" key (delete letter to the right) &lt;-- where's the codeFn/code key in the MBP?/li licodeAlt/code + codebackspace/code - Delete last word/li licodeCommand/code + codebackspace/code - Delete whole line/li /ul  Now... there is no codeFn/code Key on a MacBook Pro. What key combination should I use, or it's a matter of simply: It's not possible?  <answer15812> My MacBook Pro had a kbdFn/kbd key at lower left, and the pictures I can find confirm this (the keyboard changed several times and mine was an early model).  <answer15814> As an alternative to kbdFn/kbd+kbddelete/kbd, you can also use kbdcontrol/kbd+kbdD/kbd to trigger a forward-delete, at least in most places.  Some older apps may not support it, apparently.  <answer15829> I use kbdcrtl/kbd + kbdK /kbd to strongkill/strong the rest of the line, effectivly deleting all text after the cursor on that line.   <answer15839> h2MacBook Pro 2006 Non-Unibody Fn Key/h2  Edited based on the comment:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/W0Y21.png" alt="2006 Non-Unibody MacBook Pro Fn Key Location"  hr  hr  h2MacBook Pro 2011 Fn Key/h2  I suspect you've just missed it, as noted in CajunLuke's comment.

I set Shift-Delete as a hotkey to trigger a fn-delete keystroke.  Works a charm.    Keyboard Maestro is worth the price for the time saved.  For instance, I set code1 to backspace twice and type my email address,/code2 returns my wife's email address, etc, etc.    <comment17200> There is a Fn key on the MacBook Pro - it's in the lower-left-hand corner. All MacBook Pros have it. <comment17201> Cocoa apps and other apps that use standard system text fields should accept the Ctrl-D shortcut. <comment17232> I have a pre-unibody MBP 15'' <comment17237> @balexandre Ah, sorry, for some strange reason I thought you wrote that it was a 2011 MacBook Pro. <comment17238> @balexandre I've edited my answer to show the location of the Fn key on the 2006 non-unibody MacBook Pro. What key do you have there instead? <comment17239> What keyboard is physically installed? The function key is lowest and leftmost on the US keyboard. It might be moved on some international keyboards. <comment17240> +10 for the awesome pictures. It must be an international keyboard or have had the keycaps replaced for Fn to be missing. <comment17244> @bmike Yeah, it must be missing on some international keyboards; I looked at balexandre's profile and from that checked the Danish and Portuguese MacBook Pro keyboards and they both had Fn keys, so it must be some other version.
