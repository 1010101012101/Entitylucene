Error when choosing Print > PDF > Mail PDF - document mail PDF damaged or incomplete? <body> I'm trying to send a document to email as a PDF. To do this you'd normally go to 'Print  PDF  Email PDF' but when I do this I get an error message:      The document mail PDF could not be opened because it is damaged or incomplete.   Any idea how I can resolve this? The document itself is a Excel doc, but it happens whenever I try to do 'Print  PDF  Email PDF'. However, if I go to 'Print  PDF  Save PDF' it saves them perfectly.   Any ideas what might be causing my problems?  <comment83382> Which is your default mail application? Mail.app or Entourage/Outlook (or something else)? <comment83394> mail.app, i do have outlook on there but it not setup / the default. Although ive got outlook (not setup/default but on the hd, as with the problem machine) on other machines and they work <comment83396> Does sending PDFs from other applications work? For example, if you open google.com in Safari, can you mail it as PDF using `PrintPDFEmail PDF`? <comment83398> nope, same problem when trying it with a word doc, jpg and safari <comment83983> And can you generate a PDF with `PrintPDFSave as PDF` from Excel or Safari? <comment84003> yeah that works absolutely fine, which is odd ..
