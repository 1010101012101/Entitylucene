Options:  ul lionline marketplace: eBay, Amazon, Gumtree/li lilocal shop/li lifriends network/li /ul  <answer105983> The most painless and lucrative options would be either selling it via craigslist (be sure to meet in public and have the cash in hand before giving it up) or doing an auction on ebay. Search there to see what comparable phones are going for and price accordingly.  <answer105984> In my opinion, the best way to sell your old iPhone is eBay. You will get best resale value there. If you list your iPhone as a really valuable vintage product, you will attract more bids. The old iPhones are collectors item in many cases.  The local shop will give you the least value. And your friends may even get it for free from you.  <answer105987> According to me You will find the best buyer @ strongAMAZON/strong.  <comment124573> We're not a good place for shopping questions. Is there some technical aspect to the question that might make this more on topic than a shopping / selling discussion? <comment124591> It would be useful if you provide more details and substantiate your answer.
