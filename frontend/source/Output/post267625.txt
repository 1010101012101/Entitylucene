Stay on top windows <body> Is there any app which allow any windows (safari / Text edit) to remain on top, even in full screen ?  From what I search, afloat used to be a good solution but with random result.  <comment335854> My app NoteFlow lets you keep text on top ([download from the Mac App Store](https://appstore.com/Noteflowâ€”onenoteforlife)) and the browser app helium lets you do the same with browser windows.
