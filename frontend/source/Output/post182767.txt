Can't download apps from App Store as get button doesn't start download <body> For a couple days now, whenever I try to download an app from the App Store on my iPhone 5s with iOS 8.3, it brings up the 'use existing Apple ID' or 'create new one' window.  When I select the existing one and fill in my account information it closes the pop up window and starts to download the app (indicated by the circle starting to turn) but after one second it goes right back to the 'get' button.  When I try to download it again it all goes to square one. İt has been driving me nuts! İts like a vicious circle!  <answer182938> Whenever there is strange behaviour that doesn't seem to resolve itself, this tends to indicate that the device is hung up with respect to the sequence of steps that it needs to complete.  To force the device to take a fresh start at doing the task, you should restart the device.  <answer183014> A solution to many strange iOS problems is to back up and restore the device. I saw this issue on an iPad before, and could find no solution besides restoring it.   <answer183473> I'm having the same issue and I'm pretty sure it started with the last iOS update. One workaround I've found has been to purchase the app from iTunes on my computer. Then, go to the Updates tab in the App Store on your phone and click on Purchased items at the top. The app will be available there for download.  The only issue I'm having, and cannot resolve, is that I cannot make any in-app purchases and that's not something that can be done on a computer. Any thoughts on how to solve that?  <answer183474> Go to Settings iTunes &amp; AppStore  Password Settings  slide the "Require Password" switch. This worked for me for free apps.   <answer189838> From the Apple help site at: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201400 it recommended      Make sure that your date, time, and time zone are correct. Tap   Settings  General  Date &amp; Time.   My settings were correct. However I turned off the automatic date/time/timezone feature to make the date and time zone setting be manual.  Voila, I could connect to the iTunes/App store. I had turned my phone off and on several times. I really wanted to avoid doing a reset. So I've escaped it for now.  <answer189990> Try changing the Language setting on your phone, then change it back again to your normal language.  emSettings  General  Language &amp; Region  iPhone Language/em  I had a similar problem and after trying various things, the language swap fixed it.

I realized I have installed DeDirect and the IAPFree standalone plugin in Cydia (there were updates of the latter in Cydia). I removed DeDirect first but didn't fix the issue. After remiving the IAPFree stuff all went back to normal and AppStore download worked again. Have now reinstalled just the IAPFree standalone plugin and will wait for the next update to come through the Appstore. As a general rule, always think of what has changed since last time it worked. Feedback and let us know if that fixed it for you. Thanks  <answer195711> If you are trying to download a free item from the App Store this WILL help.   Settings  iTunes and App Store  Password settings  go from 'always require' to 'require after 15 minutes'  switch the 'require password' selection from on to off .   <answer196783> Try changing the Language setting on your phone, then change it back again to your normal language.

SettingsTouch ID &amp; Passcode then turn on the iTunes &amp; App Store option. Cheers!  <answer205339> Go to your setting, change your language to some other than your default one, let it respring and after that change back to your default language. After that it should be ok again  <comment217959> That was one of the first things that i did but it didnt make a difference after the restart. Also i signed out from the app store account information part in the settings and signed in again but it was the same. I do have enough space that doesnt seem to be an problem either. <comment254695> To begin with, before changing settings and such - check app store status https://www.apple.com/support/systemstatus/ <comment254700> I tried this, but now I just get "Cannot connect to the iTunes Store". <comment254701> Can you be more specific? Which settings page are you taking about, General  Language & Region? Which part did you change? iPhone language or Region Formats?
