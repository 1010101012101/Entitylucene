Macbook Pro 2015 Horrible Ping w/ Slow Download/Upload Speeds <body> I've been having a little issue with my wireless connection on my Macbook Pro and I can't seem to figure out what the issue is. Here's the difference in overall connection quality from my phone and my laptop.

Thanks.  <answer215752> Tether the Mac to your iPhone temporarily. You'll likely find the problem isn't the Mac but it's the service upstream from your WiFi router.
