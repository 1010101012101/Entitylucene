Automatically make QuickTime fullscreen when opened <body> Question above. I often use QuickTime for watching video tutorials, but I want to be able to start it in fullscreen automatically.  <answer237943> You could simply press the kbdâŒ˜ Cmd /kbd kbdF/kbd key as a shortcut to go to full screen. I don't think that Quicktime has any settings that support this feature natively, and it's not too difficult to press the shortcut every time you watch a video.   Otherwise you could make an an automator as suggested here: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/208399/183022   <answer237950> strongQuickTime Player/strong doesn't have a strongPreferences.../strong emmenu command/em like other applications do, nor does it have a emcom.apple.quicktime.plist/em file to manipulate. Therefore there isn't anything you can do directly, however here is a workaround of sorts.  Note that this workaround requires changing the emdefault/em application for emfile types/em, e.g. em.mov/em, you'd normally open directly with strongQuickTime Player/strong to the application created herein, called: strongQTP Full Screen.app/strong  Using strongAutomator/strong create a new emApplication/em and add a strongRun Shell Script/strong emAction/em.  Change: strongPass input: [to stdin]/strong emto/em strong[as argument]/strong  Add the following emcode/em:  precodeif [[ ! -z $1 ]]; then      open -a "QuickTime Player" "$1"      osascript -e 'tell application "QuickTime Player" to activate' \               -e 'delay 1.5' \               -e 'tell application "System Events" to keystroke "f" using command down' \               -e 'delay 1.5' \               -e 'tell application "QuickTime Player" to play front document' fi /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SI56A.png" alt="enter image description here"  Save it as an emApplication/em named: strongQTP Full Screen/strong  In order for strongQTP Full Screen/strong to be the emglobal default app/em for, e.g. em.mov/em, files you'd open in QuickTime Player you'll have to use the strongDefault Apps/strong Preference Pane, RCDefaultApp by Rubicode to change which application opens a given Extension.  Install strongRCDefaultApp/strong and then in strongSystem Preferences/strong  strongDefault Apps/strong select the strongExtensions/strong tab and scroll down to strongemmov/em/strong and then change the strongDefault Application:/strong emto/em: strongQTP Full Screen/strong  Now then you double-click em.mov/em files in strongFinder/strong or accessing them from strongSpotlight/strong the strongQTP Full Screen/strong application will open the target file in strongQuick Time Player/strong, set strongView/strong to strongFull Screen/strong and start playing the file.  Note: If you do not want it to automatically start playing the file then remove the line of emcode/em, the one that has "play front document" in it.  If you need modify other emdefault/em methods of file types, Apps, URLs, UTIs, etc. the strongDefault Apps/strong Preference Pane, RCDefaultApp by Rubicode, is a great utility for it.  To make the strongQTP Full Screen.app/strong application bundle look better in the Applications folder you can copy and paste the strongQuickTime Player.app/strong application icon from its strongGet Info/strong emsheet/em to the icon of the strongGet Info/strong emsheet/em for strongQTP Full Screen.app/strong.  Note:  The emvalue/em of the codedelay/code statements can be adjusted in emseconds/em and or emdecimal fractions/em thereof, as might be necessary on any given system to account for its processing speed.   <comment291662> I updated the _code_ in my answer since you accepted it, so please review it again.  I added a second `delay` statement as the transition from opening to full screen and playing will look better. <comment291751> @user3439894 Yes, I did think it was much too jittery. Thanks!
