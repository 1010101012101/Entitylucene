Chrome: Keyboard shortcut to leave address bar and focus browsing area? <body> Related: Chrome: Keyboard shortcut to go to Address Bar?  You can go to address bar by âŒ˜ + l / Ctrl + l, but how can I go back to, or focus, the browsing area again?  <answer234718> Pressing kbdesc/kbd will "undo" your previous keystroke and eventually take you back to the browsing area. You may have to press kbdesc/kbd multiple times though.  <answer271426> [EDIT:] Does simply pressing kbdTab/kbd a few times work for you? [/EDIT]  There doesn't seem to be such a shortcut. What you can do is press kbdCTRL+F/kbd, search for a word close to where you are on the page and then kbdEsc/kbd.  Of course this is not really convenient, so you could also do what this other answer suggests and type codejavascript:/code in the url bar, followed by kbdEnter/kbd. This executes the javascript following the colon, so it does nothing. However, it DOES refocus the page.  This is still not convenient, but using AutoHotkey, you can remap any shortcut you'd like to do this. The AutoHotkey Script would probably have to simulate kbdCTRL+L/kbd to make sure focus lies on the url bar, followed by javascript: and Enter.  I hope this helps. Sadly, AutoHotkey is only available for windows but there might be a similar tool for Mac.  <comment286972> well, this doesn't work. <comment286973> That's very odd, it works for me. Have you tried pressing kbdesc/kbd multiple times? <comment287181> yes, no effect.
