Will time machine backup my whole Adobe CS apps? <body> I wish to upgrade my OSX and am worried I lose my Adobe CS apps since they were issued by my (ex)college and i do not have the keys/seriel#'s  I didnt quite understand the answer given. Will a TM backup save all this apps/data so if my new osx gives me problems I can 'go back' and recover the previous osx and ALL my apps/data incl the Adobe stuff! ?  thanks D  <answer253975> First of all you should not use applications you don't have licenses for.  Yes, time machine backs up all data. If you chose to reinstall the same OS X version on the same computer everything should be the same.  Please keep in mind, though, that adobe's creative suite (CS1) does not work on newer versions of OA X/macOS.  <comment316201> Back up will backup every thing if told to. <comment316857> Thanks OA- The college has the license and afaik its a group license so students can use it. I paid the college to have this use - i just hope they didnt screw me over on it :D ok gtk its an all data backup  (y) yes i have CS5 suite.  thanks
