It's used to create shortcuts to existing menu items within applications.  I personally use Quicksilver for rapid access to applications, but you also use applications like Keyboard Maestro or QuicKeys.  Apptivate is another hot key manager that is specifically targeted towards activating, hiding and unhiding applications.
