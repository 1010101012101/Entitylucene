iOS calendar crashed on March 2013 <body> When selecting March 2013 in the Month view, Calendar crashes. Does anyone know what could be the cause of this ?  Ps: I tried march 2012 and the weekly view for march 2013 and there is no problem. br / Ps2: it's on a iPad 3 with iOS 6.0.1 br / Ps3: I've tried the same thing on my father's iPad : It's crashes also on march 2013. (the synchronized calendar are totaly different)  br / Ps4: Just found out that Facebook's birthdays are crashing the app on my iPad.   <answer74012> Jus tried this on my iPad 3 with iOS 6.0.1, no issue.  What calendars are syncing/subscribed to? Try temporarily disabling your accounts in emMail, Contacts, Calendars/em to see if thatâ€™s what affect it.  <answer76517> This will happen if you have an all-day event on 1-Apr-2013. If you remove this event it won't crash.  <answer76545> It seems that having an event that merely emstarts/em between 0:00 and 0:59 on 2013-04-01 causes Calendar to crash when viewing March in month view. All-day events start at midnight, so this affects them too.  Moreover, if I create an event that starts on 2013-03-31 23:55 and ends at 2013-04-01 0:55, Calendar shows the event would magically go back in time and emend/em on 2013-02-25:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gKqT4m.jpg" alt="a bug march"  I'd suggest to file a bug report on the issue  <answer80275> I would like to report that the update to iOS 6.1 solves this problem. I had the issue and now it's gone.  <comment88677> Maybe their is some weird entry in a calendar for that month? <comment92640> I've seen a few reports that updating to iOS 6.1 fixes this, but I wasn't able to reproduce this either before or after the update.
