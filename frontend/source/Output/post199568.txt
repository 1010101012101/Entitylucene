Unable to reset password in Recovery Mode <body> Unfortunately, I am unable to log in to my Mac Mini OS X (10.8.5). I am trying to recover the password with strongRecovery Mode/strong by pressing codeCMD + R/code.   I executed the coderesetpassword/code command, but the window that appears doesn't list my volume and I can't select my user account.  recovery mode img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yl9qM.jpg" alt="Resetpassword window"  <answer199741> I called apple support team for further help. They took required information from me and helped to reinstall OS. My data is erased as previously i did not kept any backup and after reinstallation it was like new MAC machine.  <comment240313> Hi. I commented on your [StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31920686/unable-to-reset-password-in-recovery-mode-of-mac). Could you update your question here with more details â€” how exactly did you get locked out & do you have FileVault enabled? If you followed the instructions from the [osxdaily article](http://osxdaily.com/2011/04/25/change-admin-password-mac/) exactly & get an error at `ls /Users`, that suggests some kind of data loss or corruption. <comment240315> Yes filevault is enabled, that is the reason why i am unable to reset password in single user mode. <comment240319> When you turn on FileVault, you're presented with a [recovery key](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204837). If you didn't write it down anywhere or [save it with Apple](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH11382?locale=en_US), you won't be able to decrypt your disk.
