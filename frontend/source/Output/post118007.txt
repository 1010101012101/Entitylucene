iPhone/iPad/iPod turn-off blocking? <body> Its possible to block turning off the iPhone/iPod or iPhone? For example, in case of loss, theft?  The point is that the thief could not turn off the iPhone, so I could find iPhone through Find my iPhone always..  <answer118009> No.  Even devices locked with TouchID can be turned off without unlocking. Even if you could restrict it, the device would eventually run the battery dead.  <answer118010> Nope, you can't prevent someone turning the phone off.  If it's jailbroken, you can install Powerguard or NoPowerDown.
