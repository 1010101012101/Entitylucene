Connect to OpenVPN on one adapter, local network on another <body> On macOS Sierra 10.12.6 with Tunnelblick 3.7.1b connecting to either OpenVPN 2.3.1 or 2.4.3, I want to route all local network traffic (lab access, etc) across my cat5 connection, with all external traffic going over OpenVPN on wifi.  So far, changing priority order of adapters in Network Preferences, attempting to add manual routes (per an SU question), and connecting the VPN before connecting the ethernet cable have all been unsuccessful.  I recall doing this several years ago - but haven't had a need to do so again until very recently.  Surely this is possible, correct? Presuming so, what do I need to do to make this work?
