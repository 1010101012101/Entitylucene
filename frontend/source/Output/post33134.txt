Mail.app removes text after inline attachment <body> Whenever I send an e-mail from Mail.app to someone with Outlook, they can't read any text that is placed beneath an inline attachment.  When I send an e-mail to myself from Mail.app any text that is placed beneath an inline attachment is attached as text-files.  This is very annoying, does anyone know how to fix this problem?  <answer33135> Under codeEdit &gt; Attachments/code, check codeAlways send Windows-friend attachments/code.  That way, the text beneath the attachment won't be cut off.  Alternatively, you can do that on a per-message basis in the attachment file selector window, like so:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QHS3G.png" alt="mail attachment window"  <comment37808> That one is checked. Same result. <comment37809> However, there's also an option to Always Insert Attachments Beneath Message. I'll just check that one for now.
