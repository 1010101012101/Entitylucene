Remove backup on Windows PC iTunes <body> Now that iCloud is available, I don't need to backup my iPad to my Windows PC. Is it possible to remove backups from my PC or do I have to uninstall iTunes?  <answer32685> Yup, it certainly is!  in Windows XP, the location is  precodeC:\Documents and Settings\user\Application Data\Apple Computer\MobileSync\Backup /code/pre  in Windows Vista, Windows 7:  precodeC:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\Apple Computer\MobileSync\Backup /code/pre  <comment37382> I'll just delete the files inside the folder and iTunes won't protest? <comment37384> That's correct. But be aware... You WON'T be able to use a back-up. So I recommend you don't delete the latter back-up. Just in case :)
