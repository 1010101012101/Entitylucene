How to query the history record of when the USB driver which has been used? <body> I always use one USB flash disk on my MacBook Air (OS X 10.10.3), but I lost it recently. I need a way to view when the last date &amp; time the USB device was connected to the computer.  <answer242545> Apple's USB Prober emshould/em do the trick  <answer242578> Unfortunately peripheral connections are simply something that isn't logged by your Mac. Just think - why would it need to keep a written log of when a USB drive is plugged in?  Hope you end up finding it again!  <comment298124> It is unclear exactly what you problem you are facing <comment298129> Thanks for your reply.
