Q: Backing up Notes.app content (on the iCloud / OSX / iOS) for safekeep? <body> I'm wondering, how do I back up Notes.app content on OSX so that I can safely either trash it all and restart, or do future upgrades?  (The reason I'm doing this is because OSX and iOS no longer sync Notes properly..)  <answer204313> The content of your Notes.app is located in code/Users/youUserName/Library/Containers/com.apple.Notes/Data/Library/Notes/code  So to back it all up you need to copy/move everything in the directory above to another location and restore it later.   <comment246238> Thank you! I've copied it to safe-keep. The only additional question is - what happens when I wish to reinstate it's contents, do I just copy that place back? <comment246241> Yes but you have to make sure that you're using the same version of Notes.app, I'm not sure what will happen if you're using a different version of the app.
