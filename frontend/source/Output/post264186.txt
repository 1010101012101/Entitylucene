How to adapt an iPad / iOS device so I can manage it through iTunes even though it was setup originally without iTunes? <body> I've recently got a new iPad that I setup from scratch using the iPad itself, eg. not connecting to a Mac.   I now want to backup the iPad and also add some photos, music etc from my Mac to it, but when I try to do this in iTunes, it asks if I want to wipe the iPad and start again. How can I adapt the iPad so I can manage it through iTunes even though it was setup originally without iTunes?
