My Ipad mini ver1 is locked and I don't know the email address login or password <body> My bIpad mini ver1/b is locked and I don't know the email address login or password.br /br / I received this as a gift from my bank for opening an account and a former work colleague set it up. I was never able to use it since I've got it about 3 or 4 yrs ago.br /br /  I tried doing a hard reset (holding Home and Start button simultaneously for a reset)the setup blocked at asking to add email and password used for setup and is linked to Find my Phone.br /br / What now, this was the reason for my problem to begin with.
