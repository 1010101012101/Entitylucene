Image annotations that remain changeable <body> I want to edit images with annotations (text, arrows, ...). Preview does offer a nice set of tools but after saving they get embedded in the image and are not clickable/modifiable anymore. Using Time Machine to reset changes is much too cumbersome.  Do you know of any similar tools where i can emeasily/em alter annotations after saving (like Skim for PDFs).  <answer113933> h2Skitch/h2  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eLFet.png" alt="Skitch by Evernote"  Skitch is a very useful app for making annotations on images, and whilst by default it saves the files using the format that they are imported as, it can save it as a strongSkitch PNG which keeps the ability to modify the annotations/strong, or the files can be kept inside its own library.
