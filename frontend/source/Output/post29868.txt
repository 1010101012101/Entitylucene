How do I get Safari 5.1 to always display the tab bar? <body> When you first open Safari and only have one page (one tab), the tab bar is not shown. When you open your second tab (e.g. by center-clicking a link to open it in a new tab), the tab bar then appears, which makes the content of the original page jump down a bit.  I expected to find an "Always show the tab bar" checkbox in Preferences, but apparently not. (Safari 5.1)  Is there a way to force the tab bar to always appear, even if there's only one tab open?  <answer29920> As it turns out, you do this through the "View" menu, rather than through "Preferences":  ol liClose all tabs but one, so you only have one tab open/li liIn the "View" menu, click "Show Tab Bar" which will make the tab bar appear/li liThis preference will stick, even if you close and reopen Safari/li /ol  Simple, but not what I expected!  <comment34287> Post the answer yourself now anyway, I was part way through describing it before I saw your comment.  It will prevent duplicate answers etc. <comment34288> @stuffe "self-answering timeout" means he can't post an answer to his own question earlier. <comment34296> Ah, thanks for clearing that up, sorry for duff comment :) <comment55382> What makes this worse is the fact that the keyboard shortcut for it is CTRL-Shift-T, which in other browsers reopens the last closed tab... <comment123300> thank you bjnord. I really wanted to show the tabs bar.
