How to diagnose video error on iOS? <body> I have a website that hosts my videos that are converted using Expression Encoder. Now I am aware of the fact that iPad wont play video if HTTP Range is not supported, however after turning on Safari Debug Tools, Safari displays info tip saying QuickTime media format is not supported.  This is the video format, img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BFTaF.png" alt="enter image description here"   I see that it does fit into acceptable parameters by iPad, still it does not play.  Is there any website where I can upload the video and find out whether video is correct or what is that goes out of iOS's parameters?
