recover/restore files with specific extension from Time Machine with OSX <body> I would like to recover/restore only code*.GIF/code files from my most recent backup. They were accidentally deleted from everywhere in codeMy Computer/code instead of just the intended folder. I currently have only 6 GB of free space (they took up about 1 GB, and only ~4000 files).  If I try selecting the most recent backup in Time Machine for recover, it starts by counting up to 20,000 files and then quits saying there is not enough space and stops. If I try to specify the Users folder, and codekind:GIF/code in the most recent backup in Time Machine, the files remain gray color and not selectable.  Am I doing something wrong, or is this not possible?  Let me know if more info is needed.  strongNOTE:/strong I edited to change "recover" to "recover/restore" - I didn't stop to think about the difference in meaning. If possible I need them back where they belong and there were so many locations - including applications and webpage downloads - I doubt I could figure it out myself.  Here is my most recent backup. Is codeSeagate Backup Plus Drive/code the drive name? With spaces?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nUhoC.png" alt="screenshot of backup drive"  precodeThis seems to work: david914s-MacBook-Air:Volumes david914$ cd "/Volumes/Seagate Backup Plus Drive/Backups.backupdb/"   But adding this, doesn't: david914s-MacBook-Air:Backups.backupdb david914$ cd "/Volumes/Seagate Backup Plus Drive/Backups.backupdb/david914's MacBook Air/"  -bash: cd: /Volumes/Seagate Backup Plus Drive/Backups.backupdb/david914's MacBook Air/: No such file or directory /code/pre  hr  Hmm...

I'm trying to recover/restore them to their original locations - the way that I'm hoping TIme Machine knows how to do (see update). So one **can not** do extension-specific restores with Time Machine? There are GIFs all over the place, <comment245050> I did not find a way to do it directly in TM. My filters actually do not work there. Also I am not sure if you could restore recursively, i.e. into the corresponding folders. <comment245058> Tried `--dry-run` got this, which I'm guessing might be OK? `sent 29 bytes  received 20 bytes  98.00 bytes/sec total size is 0  speedup is 0.00 rsync error: some files could not be transferred (code 23) at /SourceCache/rsync/rsync-42/rsync/main.c(992) [sender=2.6.9]` will take your wise advice and do a backup now before executing. Thank you very much @n1000 !!! <comment245071> added autocomplete and cd results at bottom of question - bitten by the single quote maybe? <comment245073> Yes - it's the single quote your path contains `’` not `'` in `david914’s MacBook Air` <comment245076> Just noticed: In your code dump it says `--include="/"` and should be `--include="*/"` <comment245078> You're welcome. See also my comment to your question above. You should get warnings in the output if files are skipped due to permission errors. One question at a time - just use `tab` ;) <comment245082> Same for `--include=".gif"` - should be `--include="*.gif"` <comment245083> DONE!! :)  I think I should try to tidy up my question a bit? But that will have to wait a half-day,  ditto my previous thanks @n1000. For the record: `sent 1502930485 bytes  received 42564 bytes  17999677.23 bytes/sec total size is 2536747693  speedup is 1.69` <comment245084> Great!! Glad it worked. Yes - might be helpful for others to clean up comments and question. <comment246216> There is further discussion of that possessive apostrophe [here](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/204300/143729) <comment246217> There is further discussion of that possessive apostrophe [here](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/204300/143729)
