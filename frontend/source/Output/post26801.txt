Possible to give Finder back focus after opening and closing file (e.g. in editor)? <body> When you open a file with finder (by pressing cmd-o) and subsequently close the file in whatever application opened it (e.g. TextEdit for a .txt file) by pressing for example cmd-w, the application still has the focus.   Is it possible to always have the Finder get the focus back (like on Windows)?  <answer26814> I don't know of any way to get OS X to behave like Windows in this case, but if the document you open is the only window open in that application, you can quit the app with kbdCmd/kbd+kbdQ/kbd instead of just closing the window. If you need to keep the app open after closing the window, you can press kbdCmd/kbd+kbdTab/kbd to quickly return to the Finder once you close the window.  <answer26824> In addition to @joelseph's suggestion of completing editing with kbdCommand/kbdkbdQ/kbd rather than kbdCommand/kbdkbdW/kbd, if your goal is to preview a file (as opposed to editing it) and the go back to browsing other files, using QuickLook (requires OS X 10.5.0 and later), invoked by pressing the space bar, will allow you to read a file, then return to browsing when you are done reading the file. This doesn't help if you need to emedit/em the file.
