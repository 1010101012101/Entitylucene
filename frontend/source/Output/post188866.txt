Is it possible to grab a screenshot from the AppleWatch? <body> Just wondering.. The watch can remotely control the iOS camera, and keep it's photos. I was hoping their would be a similar capability re screen images.  Thanks  <answer188870> There's a way to take a screenshot on the Apple Watch, and it's exactly what you'd expect it to be if you're familiar with the iPhone's screenshot function.  ol liPress and hold the Digital Crown./li liImmediately press and release the side button./li liRelease the Digital Crown./li /ol  You should see the screen flash and get some haptic feedback acknowledging it, and then the screenshot should show up in Camera Roll. Good luck!  Source  <comment223651> That's perfect. Thanks a ton.
