"All My Files" in Finder of Lion has stopped working <body> "All My Files" in Finder of Lion has stopped working.img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eKt0s.png" alt="enter image description here"  I suspect that this has happened after installing Path Finder 5.7.8.  <answer24631> I suspect you are correct regarding Path Finder being the culprit :). Cocoatech's Path Finder Changelog lists this in it's most recent version (5.8.8):     Fixed All Files search item in Lion and other saved searches.   Updating Path Finder should resolve this issue.  <comment27622> What exactly do you mean my "All My Files"? <comment27623> @daviesgeek - I tried posting image but it is not allowing me as for posting image one would require more than 10 reputation. I humbly request see a video of this on Youtube. <comment27632> Now you can post it. :-) <comment27646> The changelog says 5.8.8 is the latest version, yet the download link, and the OP says 5.7.8. I'm terribly confused and I suspect a typo somewhere.  Regardless, the answer to this question is: Update Path Finder, if not now, then whenever it is available.
