Rotation lock on a iPhone 5 <body> How can I find the rotation lock switch on a iPhone 5?  It is lock and does not rotates the pictures when I rotate the phone.   <answer136436> If you're running iOS 6: Double-tap the home button. Swipe to the right (as if scrolling left). There's a button with a rotating arrow with a lock that toggles rotation lock.  If you're running iOS 7 or 8: Swipe up from the bottom of your screen to open Control Center; you may need to unlock your phone first. The rightmost button on the top of Control Center is a similar rotating arrow with a lock.  <comment161863> Thank you very much. I spent a white trying to figure and  not luck. I must lock it myself when I use this screen to use the flashlight.
