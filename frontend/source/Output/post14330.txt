How can I get photographs off the iPhone 4 wirelessly? <body> My new iPhone 4 takes pretty good pictures (for a phone); they're comparable to a lower-end point and shoot. Very convenient.  But it's a pain in the butt to get the pictures off the phone. I have to manually plug it into the computer and import somehow (I use Windows Live Photo Gallery). It works, but it's cumbersome.  Is there a way to get a whole bunch of photographs off the device wirelessly?  <answer14331> Eye-Fi has an iPhone app that will perform essentially the same function as the Eye-Fi SD Cards (wirelessly transfer photos to your computer and/or the web).  More information can be found on their website - the catch is that you need to have an Eye-Fi card.  No, it doesn't appear to actually use the card, but they give the app away to card owners.  <answer14332> DropBox  The iPhone app lets you upload photos and videos. You can them sync them from DropBox to your computer when you get home. The only downside is that you have to select each photo in your Camera Roll at a time. Can't do mass uploads from the iPhone.  <answer14352> I use PhotoSync to transfer pictures wirelessly from iPhone &lt;- iPad, and from iOS devices &lt;- computer. They have little computer utilities on their website to send and catch the photos on a PC or Mac. It handles bulk transfers too. I've had good luck with it so far.  <answer14388> I'd go got DropBox, although it is true that you used to have to upload images one by one the latest version now has bulk upload. When you choose upload it shows you your camera role, you tick which photos you would like to upload, tap go and it uploads them all.   I have matched this with Hazel on my laptop for it to watch my DropBox folder and any Photos taken on my iPhone that appear in DropBox are then moved to my desktop (or other folder). Although the same action can be performed with out hazel but with a little knowledge of AppleScript.   <answer30173> Your iPhone 4 supports iOS 5.0, which can now sync photos wirelessly using Photo Stream.

It may involve photographs in a passing manner, but the technicalities of the question are probably more likely to be answered on superuser.com. <comment15427> @Reid: It's about moving files from a camera to a computer, the only thing photo related is that the files happen to be images taken with the phone camera. Perhaps there is a meta-discussion to be had about this... after all, the beta is for ironing out these things... <comment15428> Here's a thought experiment: what if the OP were having trouble transferring his photos from a Nikon D90? Would you consider it on-topic then? <comment15429> We should probably move this discussion to meta. <comment15430> OK, but the link to the meta discussion would be helpful: http://meta.photo.stackexchange.com/questions/103/move-off-topic-questions <comment15431> @Reid: Interresting point. Although the topic is the same, one also has to consider where the users can be found that can answer the question. jrista makes some interresting points in the meta-thread (that was not really about when a question is off-topic, but about whether the option to move questions to superuser will be available). <comment15432> Oops, looks like I didn't read the meta question carefully enough. Here's another meta question dealing specifically with whether this question is on topic: http://meta.photo.stackexchange.com/questions/108/questions-about-devices-which-take-pictures-but-where-the-camera-is-not-the-fir <comment15433> I do actually have an Eye-Fi card. Looks like this app will do the trick -- that is, when it is updated to work with iOS4. Thanks for the tip! <comment15434> I think the OP is looking for a bulk upload. <comment15473> Eye-Fi app will work for this, and works fine with iOS4.
