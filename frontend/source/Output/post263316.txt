Outlook apply rules to subfolders <body> For Mac Outlook, Outlook apply rules to past messages describes selecting a mail folder and using Menu Bar  Message  Rules  Apply to apply rules to existing messages.

What is the way to make this recursive so it applies to the current folder and subfolders?
