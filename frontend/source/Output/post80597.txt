Good Text List transformation Software <body> Let's say I have a list of items like so:  precodedefault cube page concave zoom linear fade none /code/pre  and I want to change it to the following:  precode'default'   =&gt; t('default'), 'cube'      =&gt; t('cube'), 'page'      =&gt; t('page'), 'concave'   =&gt; t('concave'), 'zoom'      =&gt; t('zoom'), 'linear'    =&gt; t('linear'), 'fade'      =&gt; t('fade'), 'none'      =&gt; t('none'), /code/pre  Are there any GUI based projects that could let me do this. I know the Mac has Grep Built in and there is also Text Wrangler that allows for GREP, but I find that these are too complicated (especially for short simple lists). Are there any GUI solutions?  <answer80609> The Unix shell is probably the best text list transformation software.  precode$ sed "s/^/'/;s/$/'/" &lt;&lt;&lt; cube | awk '{printf "%-12s=&gt; t(%s),\n",$1,$1}' 'cube'   =&gt; t('cube'), $ sed -E "s/(.*)/'\\1' =&gt; t('\\1'),/" &lt;&lt;&lt; cube | column -t 'cube'  =&gt;  t('cube'), /code/pre  Or write throwaway scripts in some scripting language:  precodeputs "cube page".gsub(/^.*/) { "'#{$&amp;}'".ljust(11) + " =&gt; '#{$&amp;}'," } /code/pre  Even if there were GUI applications for tasks like this, it would probably be more useful to learn (or get faster at using) scripting languages or text editors.  <comment92997> Well, you could force Numbers, Excel or OpenOffice into doing these kind of things. But using Terminal and see/awk (or even a simple for loop with echo) would be much easier to solve this particular problem. What exactly are you trying to do here (and why)?
