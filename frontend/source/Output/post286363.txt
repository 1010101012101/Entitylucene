restore photos from old iphone <body> I mistakenly deleted the photos from an Icloud account which was on a iPhone I no longer have.  My Icloud account is the same but I don't have the old phone.  Can I restore these?  <comment361304> Do you have another device that's logged into the same iCloud account but that hasn't synced the deletion back it yet? <comment361346> You ought to have 30 days grace to undelete pictures. Check the Recently Deleted folder in iCloud. [can't test, I don't use iCloud for pictures]
