Is it programmatically possible to communicate with Siri via bluetooth? <body> We see people talk on bluetooth headsets all the time. In addition bluetooth is used to send notifications to devices like watches.   My question is strongIs it programmatically possible to communicate with Siri via bluetooth?/strong  <answer147397> Yes, some Bluetooth headphones, speakers and hands-free car audio systems have Siri functionality, the Bluetooth device acts as a speaker/mic with action buttons, one commonly found being the Call button.  So, in answer to your question, yes it's possible with the right equipment.  <comment173753> Yes, but don't ask me how - my bluetooth headset is capable of talking to Siri, for dialling, asking what the weather's like etc - it initiates Siri just as though I'd held the home button, but listens to the headset rather than built-in mic. <comment173757> Cool - I reckon we need a StarTrek-style communicator badge. It looks like it is possible. <comment173758> I like that idea @hawkeye.
