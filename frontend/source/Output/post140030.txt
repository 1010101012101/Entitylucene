How to run Say "something" in background in AppleScript <body> I would like to have AppleScript code like this:  precoderow 1 say "some long text here" row 3 /code/pre  When it starts to speak text, it same time continues to row 3.  I create my scripts in AppleScript Editor and i don't know enough about process control on OS X to understand backgrounding yet.  <answer140031> You can do this by getting Terminal to run the line of AppleScript:  precodeset myscript to "say \"some long text here\"" ignoring application responses   tell application "Terminal"     do script "osascript -e " &amp; quoted form of myscript   end tell end ignoring /code/pre  <answer140060> Like this  precodesay "some long text here" without waiting until completion /code/pre  <comment165017> Thanks, but my scripts speak tons of times during day, so using this Terminal trick is not elegant enough. Maybe there is some Cocoa/ASOC code i can put to my script? <comment165018> @brianBlue Scripting means no code - but you could look at stackoverflow.com once you've gotten enough of a foothold on coding to ask there for help. I've had terminal scripts that run continually and fire every second in some cases when I need to collect data that cannot be done otherwise. Elegant is more about how skilled the artist is as opposed to the tools chosen.
