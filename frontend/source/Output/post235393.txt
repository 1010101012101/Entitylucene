Lost MacBook's last detected location <body> I received notification that Find iPhone's remote erase had been started on my lost MacBook on a specific time. I suppose someone brought it online, Apple detected it and initialized the remote wipe request I had set up. Somehow It's not showing the last location, which is weird to me. Any idea why last location is not shown?  <answer236340> I think I found the answer. Although Find iPhone app doesn't give any clue, this feature on www.icloud.com does explain it: "The location of this Mac won't be updated because it has been erased.". Looks like the behaviour is part of the product design, rationale behind the design is unclear though.
