How to get my keyboard backlight back after Mountain Lion upgrade? <body> I have a non-Unibody MacBook Pro running 10.8.2. After I installed Mountain Lion, the keyboard backlight does not light up any more. Is it a connection with the new OS, or is it a defect of my Mac?  <answer65389> You're not alone, expect an OS X update to address this very soon, until then others have had success by disabling the auto dim in low light feature.  System Preferences  Keyboard  uncheck "Adjust keyboard brightness in low light".  <comment76643> What happens when you press F5 or F6? You may need to hold Fn (function) when doing so depending on your keyboard settings. I want you to look for [this overlay](http://i.stack.imgur.com/a4Kxl.png) to appear on your screen when pressing F5/F6, or Fn F5/F6.
