OS X suddently cannot load sites like Facebook, Google until I toggle Wifi on/off <body> This is really frustrating me. This problem appeared a few weeks ago. I would be using my Mac 'normally', and all of a sudden I can no longer browse to the vast majority of sites. Sites I can still visit are Google, Facebook etc. This is across all browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox).   I am running OS X El Capitan 10.11.3. Theories as to why this may be are I can only visit sites with IPv6 enabled, but I've tried disabling that and nothing has changed. When I went to an Air BnB I had the same problem, so I doubt it's my router.   The only "fix" I've found so far is to use the Apple menu bar to turn off then turn on WiFi.   I've tried:  precodesudo networksetup -setv6off Wi-Fi /code/pre  (from Why will my Mac only load Google and Facebook?)  codesudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder/code  (from https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202516)  I think I've tried some other stuff when I first got the issue, but I've long forgotten what that was.  Thanks
