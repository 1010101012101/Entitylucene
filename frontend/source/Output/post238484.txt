How accurate is the location detection on the iPhone's Find My iPhone app <body> How accurate is the GPS on the iPhone's Find My iPhone app?  I used Find My iPhone app to track a friend. The first 3 stops were dead on but when it refreshed it showed them to be several streets over from actual location. What could cause that?  <answer238485> It's the same accuracy as the GPS accuracy of the device. If the GPS on the iPhone can't obtain a good signal, it may use Wi-Fi triangulation which will reduce the accuracy.  GPS accuracy may be decreased depending on the phone's environment (i.e. a tunnel would not have great GPS, but standing in an open field would).  <answer238504> The generic answer you can find at Apple support website      strongAbout location precision or accuracy/strong      Depending on your device and available services, Location Services stronguses a combination of cellular, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and GPS to determine your location/strong. If you're not within a clear line of sight to GPS satellites, your device can determine your location using crowd-sourced Wi-Fi and cell tower locations or iBeacons.   If you want to have specific numbers, in meters, approximately they would be next (according to the 2009 study):  ul li3G iPhone w/ A-GPS ~ 8 meters/li li3G iPhone w/ WiFi ~ 74 meters/li li3G iPhone w/ Cellular positioning ~ 600 meters/li /ul  In 2011 Dr. Zandbergen tested several Android smart phones. Here he found the accuracies to be slightly better than the 2009 study. They strongranged from 5-8 meters/strong. It is likely that the iPhone 4S/5 is within this range as well. It can also be assumed that iPads and other Android tablets will be comparable.  <answer257117> GPS doesn't use Satellites.  It is all ground based antenna arrays.  Cells use mostly cell tower triangulation.   <answer268555> Sometimes it is way, way off. By a mile or two.  <answer282957> I don't know about the positioning between cell towers and satellites, but I was having problems with getting an accurate reading/position of my sons iPhone (1-2 mile variance).  I took off the plastic cell phone case he had on it, and what do you know: it dialed right in to his exact position (1-2 yards). So try changing phone cases to see if it makes a difference, it did in my case.  <answer294931> The Find my iPhone location can be off by up to 600m. In my case, this was because my phone was in a steel and concrete structure (high rise). If you look at your location on a GPS-enabled application (other than Google Maps) and zoom in, you will see your location is distorted.  <comment292504> Getting the location is actually much more complicated than that, but yes, GPS is a primary source. According to Apple, "Depending on your device and available services, Location Services uses a combination of cellular, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and GPS to determine your location. If you're not within a clear line of sight to GPS satellites, your device can determine your location using crowd-sourced Wi-Fi and cell tower locations or iBeacons." <comment320935> You mean the Global Positioning System satellites don't use satellites?  I learn something new every day. <comment337224> We're looking for long answers that provide some explanation and context. Don't just give a one-line answer; explain why your answer is right, ideally with citations. Answers that don't include explanations may be removed. <comment337226> This answer is about as ill-informed as it's possible to get.
