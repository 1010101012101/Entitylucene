I wish I could get a new Finder window launched if I double-click the Finder icon in the dock. Is this possible? <body> I wish I could get a new Finder window launched if I double-click the Finder icon in the dock. I'm not sure if this would be possible with an Automator script, or if I would have to try to program some type menubar software or something. Any ideas?  thanks!!  <answer4212> Hyperdock will let you do something similar. It doesn't seem to support double clicking, but I have my system set up so a middle-click on the finder icon opens a new window.  It's also an awesome dock enhancement, and brings the dock much closer to the usability of the windows taskbar (i.e. you can switch to a specific other window without having to use expose or alt-tab).   <answer4220> The following AppleScript does what you want:  precodeon run     tell application "Finder"         make new Finder window         activate     end tell end run /code/pre  Open strongScript Editor/strong in the code/Applications/AppleScript/code folder, and paste the above in to a new script. Save it somewhere as a "File Format: Application" with "Stay Open" not checked.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tGYJL.png" alt="Save Options"  Then drag that application to your Dock. When you click it, the Finder will be brought to the front and with a new finder window.  The disadvantage is, this takes about 1.5 - 2 seconds to run on my machine. I could probably tweak it by making the script stay open and watch for being brought to the front... You might also get better performance by saving it as a normal script in your "Scripts" folder and putting it in the scripts menu.  <answer4301> All you're trying to do is open a new Finder window, yes?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/o6LZm.png" alt="Finder Dock shortcuts"  Why not just right-click on the Finder icon in the Dock and choose "New Finder Window"?  <comment4046> By the way you can specifically switch to another window without that: Right click an application in the Dock to see a menu of all open windows. <comment4121> Although an elegant solution, the OP wants to double click, hence the question ;) <comment4210> Why is your context menu black? :-) <comment4239> @Martín - that's why I didn't answer at first—but after I saw the upvotes for @Fake's answer (which also didn't use double-click), I thought it was worth mentioning. <comment4240> @Josh - I thought that gray (or black-ish) was the norm for dock context menus in SL (as seen [here](http://www.maclife.com/article/feature/100_snow_leopard_tips_tricks_and_features?page=0,4#node-article-4789), [here](http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=743110&p=8053305), [here](http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=743110&p=8053603), and [here](http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=743110&p=8055196)). If I installed something that makes them custom, I have no idea what it is — [Secrets](http://secrets.blacktree.com), maybe? <comment4251> @Josh Context menus are black in Snow Leopard. <comment4260> @Martín Ah ha, that's it. I'm still on plain ol Leopard :-) <comment4289> Still a 2-click solution to a one-click problem.
