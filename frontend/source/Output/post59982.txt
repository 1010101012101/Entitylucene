does icloud sync cydia apps as well? <body> Can you add an app downloaded from Cydia to iCloud, so it will sync to all your jailbroken iDevices? I wonder what content iCloud does sync and does not sync, is it folder specific?  <answer59983> Simple answer: no.   Long answer: it only works with Apple's own apps as well as apps downloaded from the official App Store.   <answer59993> It's not folder specific, but it is app specific. iCloud syncs apps from the app store only. It also syncs documents (like pages and numbers files) and media (like photos).
