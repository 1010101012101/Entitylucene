iPhone did not accept Apple ID <body> I think my original Apple ID is overwritten by new information using the same email. I went back to my Apple ID letter in my yahoo email and once I verified it, it came up with this ID did not exist. My phone did not accept it and can not see it in the my Apple ID which has the same email. Could any one tell me what happened and how to solve this problem as my phone is closed and asking for first time activation ID which I talked about.
