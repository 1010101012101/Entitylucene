Syncing iTunes between 2 accounts on the same computer <body> I have 2 accounts (emhome/em and emwork/em) on my MacBook, and would like have both accounts accessing the same iTunes library.   I have some success by putting the iTunes Library in the public folder of my emhome/em account, so my emwork/em account can access the same files too. However, what I would like is to have my Podcasts sync as well.  So that when I plug in my iPhone, I can sync my Podcast regardless which account I am on.  Any idea how to do that?  <answer42707> It seems this is not entirely possible as per this Apple discussions thread:  https://discussions.apple.com/thread/1521856?start=0&amp;tstart=0  <comment48508> This is covered at:   - http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3682/how-to-share-an-itunes-library-with-other-user-accounts-on-the-same-machine  - http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/17675/can-i-have-two-mac-users-share-one-itunes-library-on-the-same-mac <comment48510> Thanks. As I mentioned, I can share music, but I want my podcast to be synced.
