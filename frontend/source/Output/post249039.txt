AppleScript GUI scripting, why does window index not exist? <body> I am hoping to learn how to do some GUI scripting in AppleScript because I want to control Emacs, an application that is not scriptable (as far as I know).  So this works. It types "foo" into the Emacs window (called a "frame" in Emacs lingo).  precodetell application "Emacs"   activate end tell tell application "System Events"   tell application process "Emacs"     tell window 1       keystroke "foo"     end tell   end tell end tell /code/pre  However, this gives an error. It's an attempt to read the name of window 1. I need to do this because eventually I want to write scripts that do things with windows that have certain names or patterns in their names.  There error is that index 1 is an non-existing window index.  precodetell application "Emacs"   activate end tell tell application "System Events"   tell application process "Emacs"     get name of window 1   end tell end tell /code/pre  <comment308807> I don't have the GUI version of Emacs installed so I can't test. What happens if you use `get name of front window` <comment308882> That gives the same error, "can't get name of window 1, invalid index." I guess "front window" is just an alias for "window 1"? <comment308893> Yeah, I actually knew that, sorry. Anyway... Another suggestion, if you have Xcode installed, is to inspect the object with Accessibility Inspector and see if it's AXEnabled, if it's not then you'll probably not be able to script it. If an app doesn't directly support AppleScript scripting then have a look at [Accessibility Programming Guide for OS X](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Accessibility/Conceptual/AccessibilityMacOSX/OSXAXTestingApps.html) and if you can't address it this way I think you're out of luck with AppleScript in this instance.
