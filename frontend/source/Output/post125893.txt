Verbose mode startup <body> I've been having sporadic issues where my Macbook Pro Retina hangs at startup.  I started up in verbose mode and it always hangs at this message.  precodeAppleUSBMultitouchDriver::checkStatus - received Status Packet, Payload 2: device was reinitialized /code/pre  After several minutes it continues with these two message.  precodeIO80211Controller::dataLinkLayerAttachComplete():  adding AppleEFINVRAM notification IO80211Interface::efiNVRAMPublished():   /code/pre  What do those messages mean?  <answer125905>    AppleUSBMultitouchDriver   is your touchpad, it has some problems but eventually it does it, however, I would recommend the Internet recovery (cmd-opt-r) to reinstall the driver.  The      IO80211Controller   is your Network interface 802.11 making a note.  <comment147462> Do you think it's getting stuck at AppleUSBMultitouchDriver or IO80211Controller?
