Twitter app on iOS 9 doesn't connect through proxy <body> I'm connecting to a local proxy to access internet on my iPhone/iOS 9 but Twitter app seems not using the global proxy i've set for my wifi...  Other apps like Chrome &amp; Safari are working just fine!  <answer220463> iOS 9 implements App Transport Security on each individual application. This is a setting that is enabled by default on all iOS 9 apps. Application developers that wish to allow their apps to be proxied can disable this setting in the applications plist file. If you are on a jailbroken device you can also manually modify this file.  Alternatively I found this that should work, haven't tried yet though https://nabla-c0d3.github.io/blog/2015/12/01/burp-ios9-ats/   <comment258845> are any other apps not going through the proxy you set ? normally any iOS that uses NSURLConnection to make internet requests go through the settings you set in Settings - Wifi. Maybe twitter is using cellular data instead of wifi. <comment259004> I've set proxy in Settings  Wifi and as far as I've tested all apps are using it well just Twitter... I turned off cellular data, nothing changed <comment266844> Thank you for the contribution to this question's resolution.
