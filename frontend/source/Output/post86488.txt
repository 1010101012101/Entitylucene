CPU- upgrade-to-macbookair <body> My Mac Book Air's CPU has an Intel 1.23 GHz. In order to upgrade "flashplayer" I need a 1.33 GHz CPU or faster. How can I remove the current CPU and wire in a replacement?   <answer86491> It's reasonable to assume you can't. The processor is not a serviceable component in a MacBook Air.  <answer86558> The requirement from this page is for a Core2 Duo 1.33 GHz CPU or faster. Your Air's i series processor is a newer architecture than a Core2, and is considerably faster than the requirement.  <comment100034> Weird that I can't find any model of Air with 1.23 GHz CPU. <comment114546> There is no MacBook Air model with 1.23 GHz. http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook-air/index-macbook-air.html
