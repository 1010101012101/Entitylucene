My iPhone won't charge and keeps getting really hot? <body> I have an IPhone 4S and today i dropped it by accident. It didn't fall from a very big hight, about 20cm off the ground. There was no visible damage, except for the fact that it had run out of battery (I had expected that as I was only on 4%) When I got home, i charged it and it didn't turn on for about half an hour. I searched it up and it said that my phone battery had gone completely dead so it wasn't too much of a deal. Now, my phone is stuck on 1% and it has been connected to the charger cable for over an hour. It is going very hot, almost burning my fingers, and switches off every 5 or so minutes, needing to cool down. Also, as I took out snapchat, my camera turned weird colours, making everything blue and yellow. What is going on with my phone? It has a large crack at the top of the screen, and you can see parts of the phone. Most of the screen is shattered. Do I need to get a new phone? Please help!! emupdate/em my phone has been on charge for about 3 hours now. It is currently on 26% and it has had the 'iPhone needs to cool down' sign on it for about half an hour now. What do i do???  <comment249955> Quite obviously, you need to take it for repair - before it sets alight, preferably. <comment249956> do your really think it will set alight? i need to use it tomorrow, and i can't afford to get it repaired <comment249958> The 3s used to explode - not heard it happen to a 4, but you'd rather risk the entire phone against repairing what's already broken before it gets worse? <comment249960> @Tetsujin my phone is charging much quicker now and the temperature sign has gone away but it is still extremely hot and i am too scared to open the camera. Is it worth getting repaired or is a whole new phone the better option? <comment249961> ask the repair shop. <comment249994> If it were me, I'd sell that iPhone 4S on eBay as broken (charge literally around $20 and put how it overheats) and get the new iPhone 6S, or if you can't afford that, one can get a used iPhone 5S for about $300.
