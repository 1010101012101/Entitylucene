Manually lock screen <body> I would like to lock the computer when not at home but leave the computer unlocked at home.  If I choose to lock the Mac after the screen saver starts I can lock it with kbdcontrol/kbd+kbdshift/kbd+kbdpower/kbd but then these settings will also force me to enter the password when I am home.  Is there a way to manually force a lock without locking the screen saver?  <answer136694> If you don't want to reduce the time for a password prompt after the screen saver starts you can use emKeychain Access/em. Start it and in the preferences choose to show the status in the menu bar  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/a8boS.png" alt="enter image description here"  You will be then able to lock the screen immediately with emLock Screen/em:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MJ3vv.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment162235> No duplicate because I am using power instead of eject. My problem is that using Ctrl+Shift+Power just seems to turn off the screen. But I want to lock it so a password is required to work at it again. <comment162237> I quote one [answer](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/82361/9553) from that Q: "Require password immediately after sleep or screen saver begins should be checked in the Security & Privacy in System Preferences panel if you want to ensure a slept screen is also securely locked." <comment162241> Confirmed that if the security option is set to require password immediately, then Control+Shift+Power will lock the Macbook. <comment162242> Is there a way to leave this disabled and still lock the screen somehow? <comment162243> @urbaindepuce I don't understand what do you want to achieve. The setting does what you asked. Why do you want it disabled? <comment162245> I think there are 3rd party apps that can do this. In one of the other questions [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com) is mentioned. YMMV <comment162251> As written - the question is a duplicate. If you take the comments and explain how the other question doesn't work (linking to it in the body) we can then re-open this. Just explain how you don't get how the answers on the other questions would work after reading Arne's comment. <comment162262> @Matteo I don't want that my screen is automatically locked when I am at home. When I am using the computer at work or school I want to be able to lock it when leaving it. When enabling that setting I always have to supply my password when leaving and returning to my computer at home. And I don't want to set it everytime when goint to work or school or returning home. <comment162313> @urbaindepuce I updated the answer <comment162314> @bmike he commented my answer: he knows about the key combination, he wants to know how to lock the screen without using the screen saver. <comment162315> @urbaindepuce I tried to rewrite your question to make it more clear (according to your comment). You should now try to re-open it as it clearly is not a duplicate of the referenced question <comment162322> https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/lock-me-now/id464265594?mt=12 -- press command + L to lock or set your own command. <comment163522> Thank you that worked perfectly
