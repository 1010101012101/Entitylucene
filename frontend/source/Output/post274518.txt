Shared Photo Stream disabled on iPad but still taking close to 1GB of space <body> I'm trying to free some space on my iPad by removing all photos. Everything is in iCloud Library so I have these photos safely on my iPhone and my Mac.  I disabled everything in the Photos settings panel on the iPad several days ago and rebooted a few times since then, but iOS still shows close to 1GB of Shared Photo Stream data:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vuJDW.png" alt="My Photo Stream disabled"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WHWwZ.png" alt="My Photo Stream still using 838MB of storage"  How can I make sure this iPad uses no space at all for photos?
