Are there any dangers of setting kext-dev-mode to 1? <body> I am trying to make a driver work on my OSX 10.11. A guide that I am following requires the execution of the following command:  precodesudo nvram boot-args="kext-dev-mode=1" /code/pre  followed by:  precodesudo kextload [path to driver of device] /code/pre  There are some warning, however, on the internet about setting kext-dev-mode to 1.   What are the risks of doing so? Can I maybe run the second command and then set the kext-dev-mode to 0? Is it possible that the driver will work in that case?
