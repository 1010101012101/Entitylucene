What extension exist for Safari to watch Youtube videos using a foreign IP? <body> In Germany many (music) videos get blocked on Youtube because Youtube and the GEMA have not yet managed to agree on a deal for copyright fees.  This struggle has been going on for years now and there exist plenty of legal solutions for Firefox and Chrome to use a proxy service - provided by an extension - that will enable you to watch the video using a foreign IP (preferably, US or UK).  ul liAre there extensions for Safari that enable you to watch Youtube videos using a foreign IP?/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5FG2O.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer41387> We go back and forth between America and Britain, and have had to find solutions for similar problems on both sides of the Atlantic.

Once you've configured the VPN, you can go to System Preferences  Network, select your VPNOD connection, and check the box that says "Show VPN status in menu bar".

However, I've found the following website to be very reliable in providing an alternative for watching Youtube videos: http://www.youtubeunblocker.org/ For the few times where I *need* such help, this is totally enough. :) <comment108586> Can you please provide a link to the software mentioned? <comment108587> Yeah, a link would be really helpful.
