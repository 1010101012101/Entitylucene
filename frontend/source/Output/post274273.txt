Applescript / Javascript : click button with getElementsByClass <body> Here is the button I would like AppleScript to click :  precode&lt;button class="btn btn-primary" autofocus="" ng-click="ok()" tabindex="0"&gt;OK&lt;/button&gt; /code/pre  Here is my code :  precodetell application "Google Chrome"     delay 3     execute front window's tab 1 javascript "document.getElementsByClass('btn btn-primary')[0].click();" end tell /code/pre  However the script is returning a missing value and the button remain unpressed.  Any idea how can that be done? cheers.  <comment344893> Browsers won’t let you trigger the `click` event via JavaScript. For details, see http://stackoverflow.com/a/10143157/990363. <comment344897> Chrome ? Cause I have the same working with safari , but to be fair it's only working when the windows is focused <comment344902> Possibly – different browser JavaScript security models are not really something I want to spend too much time thinking about, I have bad enough headaches as it is ;). <comment345266> Do you have a link? <comment347433> `document.getElementsByClass` is not a function. `document.getElementsByClassName` is. Making that substitution worked perfectly for me. <comment347642> sorry the issue was on my post but not on my script, but still not working for me
