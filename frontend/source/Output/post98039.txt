Error message, "hpPlugInInit.kext was installed improperly" <body> I recently bought a MacBook Air and transferred my system information and user data via Migration Assistant. I used to get error messages on my old computer like this:     The system extension “/System/Library/Extensions/hpPlugInInit.kext”   was installed improperly and cannot be used. Please try reinstalling   it, or contact the product’s vendor for an update   I hoped that this would go away with the new computer. (No, that's not why I bought it but it was supposed to be a good side-effect!)  But now I'm still getting this error message when installers are running. I don't have any HP printers, but I did at one time. How can I get this error message to stop? According to the HP support website there is an uninstaller I can run, but I don't have any such uninstaller.  <answer217100> Manually deleting codehpPlugInInit.kext/code under code/System/Library/Extensions//code gave me a solution.   <comment115240> sounds like HP crapware was installed - with OS X there really is no need for their software as the printers can use Apple drivers. you should manually remove the kernel extension (carefully) <comment115306> @JohnWoods: What's the best way to manually remove the kernel extension in a safe manner? Of course backup is the first option, but otherwise what's the procedure, and how to check to make sure it's not going to screw up my system?
