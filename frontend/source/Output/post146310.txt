What is Master Device in MIDI? <body> So, what is the "Master Device" in Multi-output device? Cause I'm trying figure out how MIDI Aggregate Devices work, I need to now what is it.  <answer146321> MIDI system needs to know who is the master.   It is for the master volume adjustment when you have strongmultiple output devices/strong.  Each output device can have its own volume adjustment preset, but the master volume will control overall Volume.  The MIDI has 2 options to set up:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9Ehxx.jpg" alt="MIDI"  The Create Multi-Output is self explanatory.  The Aggregate is:     You can combine several audio devices to use as a single device, known   as an “aggregate device.” By aggregating devices, you can increase the   number of discrete audio inputs and outputs without purchasing more   expensive multichanneled audio equipment. For example, if you have an   eight-channel audio device and a two-channel audio device, you can   combine them to work as a single ten-channel audio device.      For the aggregate device to work correctly, the sample rates of the   combined devices in the aggregate device must be set to the same   sample rate.
