Apple Watch 2 - how fast will GPS find your location? <body> I own a Apple Watch (first gen) and do a lot of running with it. I'm interested in buying the Apple Watch 2 because of the GPS function.  I know a few other runners that use sportwatches like TomTom / Garmin / Polar. The number one complaint is it takes long until it finds your location (sometimes minutes).   How fast does the AppleWatch find my location when I don't have my iPhone with me?
