iPhone as 'headphones' for computer <body> I have been using headphones with an external USB sound card, but the sound card broke today, and my other audio ports are messed up.  I have an iPhone, and I know that a computer with a wireless card can stream it's audio to an iPhone, but can a computer without a wireless card (on an ethernet connection) use this or a similar service to send audio to an iPhone? Maybe even a tethered iPhone, because I can do that.  <answer37387> maybe look into airfoil and its iOS companion app?  <comment42390> yes, this looks like exactly what I need.. do you know if airfoil will work with a computer that does not have a wireless connection so the computer is connected to the internet via ethernet? <comment42392> i don't know for sure, i did some preliminary googling but couldn't find a definitive answer.  I know this is a cop out, but why not try the trial version? <comment42397> I tried the trial version, but it just had the problem I though it would have: since the computer is not on the same network as the iPhone, it has no way of finding the iPhone as a place to send sound to... can I tether the iPhone to the computer, and somehow many a computer to computer network that way? <comment42578> i doubt it, sorry. <comment42702> damn... oh well, thanks anyway
