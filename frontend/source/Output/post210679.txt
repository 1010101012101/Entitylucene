Yosemite 10.10.5 umask issue <body> I'm having issues with setting the default umask on our Macs for users. I run the following the commands to set the default perms to 775:  precodesudo launchctl config user umask 002 sudo launchctl config system umask 002 /code/pre  But if I then run: touch file.txt the perms on file.txt show up as:  precode-rw-rw-r-- /code/pre  If I change the umask to 000, which should set perms to 777, I see the following:  precode-rw-rw-rw- /code/pre  All the Macs in question are running 10.10.5  Is this related to the fact that if you go to: Get Info  Sharing &amp; Permissions  the only options available are Read &amp; Write or Read Only? We're encountering issues whereby our Linux users can't open files copied to network storage by Mac users because the permissions aren't 775.  The only work around I've got at the moment is to get Mac users to mount network shares via SMB instead of using NFS. I'd quite like to know if there's a better method.
