Fixing the iPodsevice error on iTunes startup <body> I've been getting this error consistently since last year, and no one on Apple's forums has a solution. I've tried everything that's been suggested but nothing has worked out. I've uninstalled and reinstalled iTunes many times, completely removed Apple products from my computer using smart install and restarted my system many times but still get the same error.  When I start my computer an iTunes dialog box appears saying     The software required for communicating with iPods and mobile phones was not installed correctly. Do you want to iTunes to try to repair this for you.   After typing in the administrator password I click codeYes/code and an error pops up basically saying     Error in C:\Program Files\iPod\bin\iPodService.exe missing iPodSevice.exe   but I have the file in my ProgramFiles. Any suggestions.
