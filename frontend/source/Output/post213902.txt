How do I tell Safari not to change the active tab on the error console when I reload a page? <body> When I reload a page on Safari 9.0, El Capitain, with the developer tools open and the "Console" tab active, it will automatically switch to the "Resources" tab. How do I stop this deliberately stupid behavior?   <answer218126> Usually I open the developer tools by using the "Inspect Element" context menu, and get the same behaviour as you describe (automatically switching to the Resource tab).  So I experimented and found an answer: If you open the developer tools to the Console tab by selecting Develop  Show Error Console from the menu, it will stay on the Console tab after a page refresh.  Also, if you open the developer tools using the "Toggle Web Inspector" icon or the Develop  Show Web Inspector menu item, it will stay on whatever tab you have selected after a page refresh.  <answer229323> Close the Resources tab then it always stays on the tab where you are on every reload  <comment263682> Which you can also enable by ⌘⌥C (the "Elements" tab by ⌘⌥I) <comment263818> Okay, so the above worked for me every time when I tested it before answering the question (10+ times). However, today it was automatically switching to the Resources tab (and sometimes the Storage tab) no matter what I did. So you can probably disregard my answer. <comment264127> I was about to duplicate this question with even a screen recording to demonstrate this issue: http://gfycat.com/InsignificantSpiritedGrackle, before I found yours. Thanks for asking! <comment264128> @adita menon no problem! It works fine if the app isn't split screen.
