How to refresh metadata in iTunes? <body> I've updated much of my songs' metadata using codeMusicBrainz Picard/code and it's successfully updated in the code.mp3/code files. However, a song's updated metadata is not reflected in iTunes until I play it. Is there a way to refresh this data for all the songs at once.  Also, just for testing, I dropped a music folder into iTunes. Instead of updating the song's metadata, it added the songs again and now I have duplicates.  PS: I am on Windows 8.1  <answer128957> Found a VBA Script here :br/ http://samsoft.org.uk/itunes/UpdateTagInfo.vbs  You can find many other scripts there too:br/ http://samsoft.org.uk/itunes/scripts.asp  <comment150974> I only know a way to achieve this via AppleScript, thanks to DougScripts. BUT, i have seen some people doing some VBA coding, that was pretty similar to AppleScript code. <comment150975> found them, see my answer
