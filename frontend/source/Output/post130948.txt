Change Default from Copy to Move <body> We have several Mavericks systems, currently all but one moves folders when dragging and dropping, however only one requires the command key to be pushed for it to move.  Is there a setting or tweak to do to force this action so it always moves instead?  <comment153691> The default should be `move` within the same partition. It might be a permission issue.
