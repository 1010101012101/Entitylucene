Macbook External Display turns off after few seconds <body> So I recently bought a AOC monitor. It has a VGA port so I used a mini Display Port to VGA adapter and connected it to my Macbook Pro. Now the problem is that Macbook detects an external display, but there is no output on the  display.   I have already reset NVRAM and SMC as suggested on some forums but that didn't help either. An interesting feature is that when I restart the Macbook, then the Macbook display is mirrored for a few seconds and then sleeps and shows no signal again.   Any clues ?
