Tagging system files <body> I noticed that system files and folders cannot be tagged using the UI in Finder and I am wondering whether there is a workaround – Terminal based or otherwise.  There are a number of system files I'd like easy access to and tags would serve that purposes.  <answer108079> I would suggest doing what @Lauri Ranta proposes : doing this with codexattr/code  Using codexattr -wx com.apple.FinderInfo "$(xattr -px com.apple.FinderInfo 'file1')" "file2"/code you can copy the tag from file 1 to file 2.  Since code/System//code is not writable for users, you just going to need to use codesudo/code.   Edit:  To see the tagged files, you'll need a Finder with root access.  You can get it as using :   codekillall Finder &amp;&amp;udo /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app/Contents/MacOS/Finder/code  strong/!\ But Warning/strong. A Finder with Root access is very dangerous and you could easily destroy your system.   Edit2: With the Root Finder you can directly change the tag without using the command line. But Again, root Finder is baaaad.   <comment126733> Okay … tagging works, technically. Any idea how I can get the file to show up in the "tagged as" selection now? <comment126734> Probably because you're not the owner of this file. Run a Finder with root access (which is baaaaaad). <comment126735> I concur, not a good idea. Even though you technically  provided a working solution I'll leave this question unanswered for a little while longer in the hopes of getting a workaround for the related issue that doesn't involve root and/or messing with the files in question more than strictly appropriate.
