How do I get F11 and F12 to behave like normal function keys? <body> I have a 2013 MacBook Pro Retina 15" and I'm trying to set the function keys to perform as normal function keys.  So I want the behaviour to be inverted from the standard behaviour where I need to press kbdFn/kbd to get the keys to work normally.  I've enabled the setting in Preferences as shown below.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9h2A4.png" alt="Preferences Pane"  This works fine for all function keys except kbdF11/kbd and kbdF12/kbd.  kbdFn/kbd + kbdF11/kbd and kbdFn/kbd + kbdF12/kbd both have the expected behaviour of adjusting the volume now, but when I press kbdF11/kbd by itself it enters Expose and when I press kbdF12/kbd by itself it launches Dashboard.  How can I get my kbdF11/kbd and kbdF12/kbd keys to just behave like normal function keys?  <answer110528> Well I actually just figured this out.  In Preferences under Mission Control there were two options set to use the kbdF11/kbd and kbdF12/kbd keys.  I set these to '-' and that fixed the issue.  The options that were set to use these function keys are highlighted in the screenshot below.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AwiKu.png" alt="Mission Control Prefpane"  <comment167476> In OS X 10.9 Mavericks (and possibly earlier too), the same setting can *also* be changed from Keyboard, Shortcuts, in the Mission Control section there. <comment207285> cono I'm still having orbs with the f11 and f12. when I changed the show desktop and show dashboard to blank, the buttons moved the screen to dashboard, but the volume still doesn't work <comment220049> I'm not sure I understand your comment.  If you've already done what I did in this answer then you must have a separate issue.  It might be worth asking another question <comment251488> This is making life working remotely from my Apple machines so much better! <comment264594> Very very useful. Now I am able to boot into PXE again over ilo! <comment366480> I love F11 for expose... however I'd like it not to do this *only when using VS Code*.
