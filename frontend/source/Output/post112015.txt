Size in bytes is significantly less ( half the size) then size in MB in get info window <body> In the get info window it says 387,037,139 bytes which is 387 MB whereas the size on disk is 716.9MB which is 716,900,000 bytes.   codedu -sh paramgen/code  result (in MiB) code684M    paramgen/code  Why is there such a large difference?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yhlmv.png" alt="get_info screen"  <answer112021> 387,037,139 bytes is the sum of the file lengths in bytes. A file however uses whole blocks on disk, hence even a one byte file takes one block. On the partition on which I tested this, a block is 4K. The “on disk” value is the number of blocks times the block size.  The difference between 684 and 716.9 is a factor of 1.024*1,024, that is the difference between the two possible meanings of megabyte.
