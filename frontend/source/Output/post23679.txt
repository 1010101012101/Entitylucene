Tor Browser Bundle Firefox error <body> I just installed the Tor Browser Bundle (1.0.24).  Vidalia launches with no problems.  Tor connections are created.  However, Firefox doesn't start.  When I manually click on the Firefox app in the Vidalia bundle, I get the following error:  precodeYou can't open the application Firefox.app because it may be damaged or incomplete. /code/pre  Is this a Lion-specific error, or is it something I'm overlooking.  Thanks for your help!  <answer23681> In Snow Leopard, if I just close it all and start it again it works fine the second time.  Alway fails on the first invocation.  I haven't debugged it further.  <comment26467> Hmm, you're right, the second time it works fine on Lion.  Go figure... Many thanks! <comment26484> @newmacfan Welcome, please give a correct answer an up vote and mark it as accepted if it solved your problem :)
