Non-Winclone Boot Camp backup solution <body> I have an 11,3 i7 iMac, from around 2010. I want to upgrade to Mavericks and do a clean install of both Mavericks and Windows 7 in Boot Camp - reformat the internal HD and repartition.  I need a solution for backing up my Windows user files - documents, some apps if possible - but I don't need an actual image of my old partition. I did pick up a copy of Winclone and I'm running it, but the backup process is incredibly slow. Check out these timestamps!  precode26-03-14 02:37:28   Winclone[6116]  53.51 percent completed 26-03-14 03:06:37   Winclone[6116]  54.52 percent completed 26-03-14 03:37:34   Winclone[6116]  55.53 percent completed 26-03-14 04:13:04   Winclone[6116]  56.54 percent completed 26-03-14 04:46:15   Winclone[6116]  57.55 percent completed /code/pre  Is there any alternative to Winclone (I refuse to believe that imaging a 250GB partition requires a fifty-hour period) and is there some way I could simply back up my Windows files instead of the whole partition? I know the two filesystems are different, so it cannot be as simple as simply dragging the files from the Boot Camp partition to my external 3TB Seagate?  <answer125640> Any Windows Backup software of your choice. Altho you then might have to reinstall windows before you can restore the files themself.  <answer135432> Perhaps the easiest way to back up files is to create a Windows partition (Fat, NTFS, or ExFat) on your back-up drive.  Then simply copy the files you wish to save into that patition.  Be careful when using backup software made for Windows.  Most are not designed for use on a disk which was not formatted using Windows.  One of the more popular Windows backup programs, Acronis True-Image, doesn't even work on boot-camp.  At least I couldn't get the 2011 version to work.  <comment146984> Yes it is. You can backup your Windows files to your external 3TB Seagate IF it is NTFS, FAT32, or exFAT. Just drag and drop the files onto the Seagate.
