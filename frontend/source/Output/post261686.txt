How to update to iOS betas using iTunes <body> I can update to iOS 10 betas with OTA Updates, but I want to update using my computer through iTunes because the it is connected via ethernet so download speeds will be faster.  Is there any way to do this?  strongEdit:/strong I am not a developer.  <answer263843> As far as I could see it is not possible to download public beta's from iOS to your Mac. The only option Apple gives are OTA updates.   You could register as a developer, but the beta's are only available for paying developers.   If you are a developer, you can download beta's from developer.apple.com/download.   ul liLogin/li liGo to the iOS section/li liChoose the right device/li liDownload/li liOpen iTunes/li liConnect iOS device/li liClick on the update button with alt (option) button pushed./li liSelect the downloaded beta/li /ul  <answer273765> I came across this website on reddit. It has downloads for IPSW files for betas and beta profiles.  <comment332905> What do I click on when I reach developer.apple.com <comment332912> Changed the URL.
