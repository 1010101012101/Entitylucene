404s "tracker" for Mac OS X <body> I'm looking for OS X software that can help me track 404 errors on my site.  <answer1091> If you want to track broken links, the best way to do it is checking the production/online site. I’ve used BrokenLinkCheck in the past. It’s free and it delivers. Your mileage may vary.   <answer1092> What are you using to watch the stats on your website? Most stats packages that read the logs will give you a 404 report (eg. AWStats, Summary).  If you're looking for a program to run on your Mac to check that for you; Piltdown Link Checker, Integrity, WebLight or LinkByLink are all options.  <comment891> Do you mean broken links? <comment893> yes, 404 i.e. broken links <comment894> i asked for a software not online service, but thanks anyway! <comment71227> Shouldn't this be on Server Fault or Super User? <comment71228> An online service *is* a form of software. You might have a reason to prefer *local* software over software running on a remote machine, but "software" and "online service" are not mutually exclusive categories. <comment71229> It's a request for software that runs on a Mac. It's on topic here.
