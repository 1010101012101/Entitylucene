Is there any way to move the itunes files (not just the music library) to another folder? <body> I'm running iTunes on Windows 10 and I'm trying to move the iTunes folder out of the root of my music folder. I want that folder to have only music.  All I can find is instructions on how to move the 'iTunes Media' folder from "Music\iTunes\iTunes Media" to another spot. strongI want to move the whole iTunes folder, including .itl and .itdb files./strong  <comment367294> I believe some people have reported this doesn't work - not able to test due to lack of suitable OS - https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/73563/moving-the-itunes-library-to-the-data-partition <comment367295> Closing as dupe - but please edit this if you're situation is different than the post that's unanswered. An edit there might help bump it to the home page or a bounty.
