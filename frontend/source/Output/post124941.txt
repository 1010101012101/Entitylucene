iSight Camera not present on iMac <body> I have an iMac 9,1 running Mavericks.  I recently tried to take a photo using the built in iSight camera, but it seemingly cannot initiate the device.  Using Photo Booth just presents me with a spinner icon until it shows me this eventually:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ohXL8.png" alt="enter image description here"  Checking in emSystem Report/em shows the following information (Note the spinner again when checking the Camera section:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kKCnd.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/s2yo1.png" alt="enter image description here"  I last used the camera less than a week ago, and had no issues.  I don't even think it's been rebooted since I used it last (although I have rebooted to see if it makes a difference).  Lastly, I get the following lines constantly repeated in the console twice a second, which may be related:  precode19/03/2014 20:32:50.772 com.apple.launchd[1]: (com.apple.cmio.VDCAssistant[4913]) Job appears to have crashed: Abort trap: 6 19/03/2014 20:32:50.798 VDCAssistant[4914]: AVF warning: failed to get a service for display id: 4128828 19/03/2014 20:32:50.799 VDCAssistant[4914]: AVF warning: failed to get a service for display id: 4128829 19/03/2014 20:32:50.799 VDCAssistant[4914]: AVF warning: failed to get a service for display id: 4128830 19/03/2014 20:32:50.799 VDCAssistant[4914]: AVF warning: failed to get a service for display id: 4128831 19/03/2014 20:32:50.811 VDCAssistant[4914]: CGSDisplayID: App trying to enumerate [0 to CGSGetNumberOfDisplays()] instead of using CGSGetDisplayList().

This has affected numerous people, mainly those with AirDisplay (due to the integration that AirDisplay provides â€” it's not really using supported APIs).  Until this problem is fixed, either by AirDisplay or OS X (for those suffering with a similar problem that seems to be caused by FaceTime), stronguninstalling AirDisplay/strong and/or turning off FaceTime seems to fix it.  <comment146239> I had AirDisplay installed, and had seemingly updated to 10.9.2 since I last used the camera.  Uninstalling brought things back to life.
