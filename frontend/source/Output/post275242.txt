How do I get iCloud and Appstore to work with a USER on my MacMini? <body> The problem is on a MacMini desktop for one USER and it isn't the iPAD or an iPHONE where there aren't settings to drop down. I can get in the icloud with the iPAD and I can get on the Appstore by Logging in as different users. Can there be a fix to this problem somewhere I'm not seeing? As I am able to sign on as USER2 or USER 3, but what am I missing when I LOG on using USER 1? All the Users are Admins, so what could be the problem with USER 1 Log On? Facetime, iCloud, Appstore, all work on the iPad (which I sent a verification code from) and the computer IF I am logged onto the computer as USER2 or USER3. I can even simultaneously be logged on, but not directly USER1. And that's the one I've been using since 2009, has all the apps, docs, downloads, etc etc.   <comment346186> I assume this is the same issue as http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/275136/how-do-i-reset-icloud-for-a-particular-user, correct? It might be better to add details to the first question then.
