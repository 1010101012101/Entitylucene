Which is iPad 2 home button? <body> Which is the Home button on my iPad 2?  I've tried button for rebooting and the one on the screen.

If the device is already on pressing the home button will wake the device (if it's charged). To ensure its on press and hold the power button for 5 seconds or until the screen turns on. Dont forget if you haven't charged your device it will not power on for you  <comment370289> Welcome to Ask Different! :) The *Home* button is the circular physical button at bottom centre of the front of the iPad 2 (just below the screen).
