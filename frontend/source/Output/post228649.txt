Receiving iMessages <body> I have iMessage turned off on my phone to save data. I have recently realised I am not receiving messages off friends who have iMessage switched on on their phone. Is there anything I can do apart from turning my iMessage back on to receive these.   <answer228660> You may choose to deregister from iMessage. Take a look at this  link. However it is only recommended when you are switching to another platform.
