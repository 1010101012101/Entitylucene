Change Date Format to German (English) <body> I accidentally changed my date format from "German (English)" to "German (Germany)". Now I can't seem to get it back.  I need that format. I changed a UK Format to my needs but having a predefined option would make me much happier.   Any suggestions on how to get it back?  (I'm running OSX 10.8.5)  <answer102886> You can change date format, decimal sign, etc. under:  system preferences  language &amp; text  region (tab)  I believe if you set your region to english and then go to   system preferences  language &amp; text  language (tab)   and select German there, you should have "German (English)" back.  <answer102898> Go to the codeSystem Preferences/code from the dock.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Mzng5.png" alt="enter image description here"  Now select codeLanguage &amp; Text/code and go to the codeRegion/code tab. Click on codeShow all regions/code and you should have it like this.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oNm9Z.png" alt="enter image description here"  In the region selector, select codeGerman -&gt; Your country/code  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/x3nYr.png" alt="enter image description here"  And it should bring it back. Hope this helps.  <answer108776> In Mavericks the Date Settings are finally independent from the language. So this questions becomes obsolete.  <comment121190> This is not what the topic starter is asking. You are just showing how to change the regional setting. He is asking for changing the regional setting, while maintaining the language setting. <comment121191> That's it. He selects the language first and then the region in that language. <comment121194> Alright, then you should add that to your post, because it doesn't say that he should select his language right now. You just mention that he should change his region, not the language.
