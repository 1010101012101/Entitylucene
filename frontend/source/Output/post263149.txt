MacPro (mid 2012) crashing when put to sleep <body> My 3.2 quad, 8gb ram, sierra 10.12.1 is crashing when it goes to sleep. Any ideas? Does it in safe mode, after PRAM reset, and with all peripherals disconnected.   <comment329712> Please create a new user account (administrator). Restart and log into the new user.

Replacing the video card solved it.
