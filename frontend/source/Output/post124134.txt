Deselect text using keyboard shortcut or prevent selection of word/link on right click <body> I often copy links in Chrome with the context menu, to paste into a chat window (Adium). This process selects the link on copy. When I cmd+tab back to my browser window, the text is still selected and it interferes with keyboard control of the given website. This forces me to move my hand back to the trackpad, find some non-active space (page bg usually), and click to deselect. I'd rather not have to move my hand from the keyboard to do this.  I've tested this in Chrome, Safari, and TextEdit. I could maybe solve it in Chrome with a userscript, but I'd like a more general solution for other programs as well.  emedit/em Another way of looking at this problem is that OSX selects the word or link on right click with a context menu, but doesn't clear the selection when the context menu is closed. Is there a way to force deselection of text on context menu close?  <answer124140> Tapping an arrow key will deselect the text.  <answer152397> cmd+a (select all) cmd+shift+home [at least tested on PC with control+shift+home]  <answer262243> Hold down the control key and single mouse click on the page.  <comment145094> No dice in Chrome. That works in TextEdit and other "editing" fields like a textarea where you have a blinking cursor to move, but not with plain text or a link on a webpage.
