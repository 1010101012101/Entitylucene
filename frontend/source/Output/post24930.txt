Why can't I use the GNU Debugger (GDB) programming utility on Mac as a standard user? <body> I can only use the GNU Debugger (GDB) when authenticated as an administrator.  When I launch GDB as a standard user, after giving the GDB command "run", a dialog requests me for a user name and password of a user in the "Developer Tools" group.  The problem is that I already am in the "Developer Tools" group, so I do not know what else to do...  Thank you!

Try running this command  precodesudo dscl . append /Groups/_developer GroupMembership &lt;username&gt; /code/pre  That should add your user account to the group.  <answer112132> I had the same problem, it wouldn't run, except as root/sudo, which meant I couldn't use it with eclipse, which meant I lost 5 working hours debugging the problem. Here are my results.  Firstly, gdb generated a similar error message when executed under my user account.   precodeUnable to find Mach task port for process-id 4667: (os/kern) failure (0x5).  (please check gdb is codesigned - see taskgated(8)) /code/pre  I tried code signing it by creating a certificate using Keychain, then marking the certificate as trusted for code signing. Then applying it to the executable from the command line.   precodecodesign -s gdb-cert /usr/local/Cellar/gdb/7.6.1/bin/gdb codesign --verify --verbose  /usr/local/Cellar/gdb/7.6.1/bin/gdb codesign -d --verbose  /usr/local/Cellar/gdb/7.6.1/bin/gdb /code/pre  h1That didnâ€™t work/h1  I tried adding my user account to the procview, procmod, and _developer groups (probably insecure, but I only deploy my code to github, and don't use the machine for personal use, so I can live with that)  precodesudo dscl . append /Groups/procmod GroupMembership bryanhunt  sudo dscl . append /Groups/procview GroupMembership bryanhunt  sudo dscl . append /Groups/_developer GroupMembership bryanhunt /code/pre  h1That didn't work/h1  Finally, I tried changing the executable's group and group sticky bit.  precodesudo chgrp procmod /usr/local/Cellar/gdb/7.6.1/bin/gdb sudo chmod g+s /usr/local/Cellar/gdb/7.6.1/bin/gdb /code/pre  h1That worked/h1  <comment28088> Now I know that the groups shown in the GUI are not the real ones ;-)   Thank you! <comment328524> no matter what I do, I get the below error. Anything that you might know to help me. `Starting program: /Users/nakulchawla/POPL/proj5/a.out Unable to find Mach task port for process-id 571: (os/kern) failure (0x5).
