Adobe Premiere playback <body> I am trying to playback a clip in Adobe Premiere Pro. The picture plays back just fine. The problem is that the clip is all stretched out, making all the characters look flat and stretched out. When playing these clips in VLC or Quick Time, the image is not stretched at all but playing in the right proportions for the screen. Does anyone know what I am doing wrong or how to change the video output on Adobe Premiere? thanks ROBERT  <comment322705> Welcome to Ask Different.

If you are shooting in 1080p and working in a 720p or 480p workflow, it will usually scale incorrectly. Try looking at the effects by double clicking on the video clip, and changing the dimensions until it looks natural. Still need more info to solve the problem if it is a monitor or GPU issue. <comment323052> Hi Bret.... The AVI files play fine in FINAL CUT PRO... They were captured in Adobe Premiere Pro... So that makes no sense why they will not play properly and all stretched out. The AVI clips play fine in VLC and as clips in my Quick Time Player. If I double click on the clip there is nothing on the menu that comes down to the screen from 16x9 to 4x3 or anything like that...  It's not a Graphics Processing Unit either because the clips play fine in Final Cut Pro 7. I'm sure it's something simple. These are not clips shot in 1080p. They are film clips that were shot on 16mm from film I directed
