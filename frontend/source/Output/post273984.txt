Error messages in rsync <body> When I run  precodersync -avz --exclude-from=exc ~/ /Volumes/Backup/home/ /code/pre  I get the message  precodesending incremental file list ./ .DS_Store ...&lt;snip&gt;... (lots of files)....  End of list of files  sent 72,625,409 bytes  received 16,434 bytes  1,793,625.75 bytes/sec total size is 28,049,731,319  speedup is 386.14 rsync error: some files/attrs were not transferred (see previous errors) (code 23) at main.c(1249) [sender=3.1.2] /code/pre  What should I do to avoid this error message?  <answer274146> It seems that the only thing that was missing from my rsync run was to copy extended attributes. I ran the command again, but this time adding the option -E (which I think is specific to Macs) and the job ran with no error reported.  <comment344393> Can you add the exact command including options you are running? And the full output, not just the error message <comment344436> The important bit is that the file says see previous errors - these previous errors are the things that need to be investigated
