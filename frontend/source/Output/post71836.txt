How do I enable Java Web Start for ASDM Launcher (Cisco ASA management) in Mountain Lion? <body> I've been trying to get my Cisco ASA management software working and on Snow Leopard, it ran fine. However, even after installing Java manually on Mountain Lion (on my new Macbook Pro), I continue to receive this message:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0Z50o.png" alt="error message"  I've searched as best as I can and my google-fu is really failing me here. How do I resolve this? There's nothing in the Java Preferences pane that even references Web Start applications. Help?  Edit: Clicking on the "More Info..." button sends me to http://www.java.com/en/download/mac_download.jsp which is where I downloaded and installed Java from the first time I got this error.  <answer72119> You should try to install the latest version of Java from the official website.  <answer72138> There is a known bug with the asdm and java 1.7.  You will need to find a version of 1.6 to run it.     ASDM Launcher does not work with JAVA version 7      Symptom:      ASDM Launcher hangs when JAVA version 7 is used. However, it is   still accessible from the browsers. The following exception is seen:      "Exception in thread "AWT-EventQueue-0"   java.lang.ClassCastException: sun.security.ssl.X509TrustManagerImpl   cannot be cast to   com.sun.net.ssl.internal.ssl.X509ExtendedTrustManager"      Conditions:      Using JAVA version 7.      Workaround:      Use JAVA version 6 or access ASDM from the browser.   <answer72175> If this is indeed a bug with your application and Java 7 as Mark mentioned, you can re-enable the previously-Apple-provided Java 6 and Web-Start functionality by following the steps from HT5559. The steps are below, along with commands to undo these changes, if they do not help.  Open Terminal in an administrator account (Terminal is in /Applications/Utilities) and run this command: codesudo mkdir -p /Library/Internet\ Plug-Ins/disabled/code to create a directory for "disabled" plugins that you don't want to run.  Run codesudo mv /Library/Internet\ Plug-Ins/JavaAppletPlugin.plugin /Library/Internet\ Plug-Ins/disabled/code to move your current Java plugin to the new "disabled" folder.  Run      codesudo ln -sf   /System/Library/Java/Support/Deploy.bundle/Contents/Resources/JavaPlugin2_NPAPI.plugin   /Library/Internet\ Plug-Ins/JavaAppletPlugin.plugin/code   to link Apple's Java plugin to make it your current JavaAppletPlugin.  Run     precode sudo ln -sf  /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Commands/javaws  /usr/bin/javaws /code/pre   to re-enable Java Web-Start.  hr  To disable the above, follow the directions below:  Open Terminal in an administrator account and run:   precode sudo ln -sf  /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/Current/Commands/javaws  /usr/bin/javaws /code/pre   to disable Java 6 Web-Start and replace it with the newest Web-Start functionality.  and Re-install the newest Java Runtime Environment 7 from Oracle.  <comment83421> When you click More Info.... What website gets opened? Did you download anything from that site? <comment83423> The java website gets opened. I installed the latest java for OS X from there (sorry if I wasn't clear in the first part of my post). <comment83724> Uh, sorry, was my post not clear? I have already done this. <comment83726> @Brendan Have you also installed the Apple Java version? <comment83727> http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572 <comment84496> Ok, so, I tried these steps, and they didn't entirely work (app still complained about missing JRE for web start), however I did try `javaws https://10.1.10.1/admin/public/asdm.jnlp` in Terminal and that let me launch the ASDM interface. My question now is... why does this work? <comment84570> @Brendan Most likely, the app didn't work immediately from my instructions because you haven't fully restored Java 6.  The [answer to this question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/72382/how-to-reinstall-java-6-for-development-for-android-on-mountain-lion) should be useful for you. What my answer did was restored Java 6 Web-Start by digging up an old version of the plugin from a different folder than "Current" and linking it to your /usr/bin/javaws. What you should do to run ASDM w/o Terminal is see the above link and download [this Java](http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572). <comment137249> I am using jenv to manage the various Java versions on my Mac. So I used "jenv local oracle64-1.6.0.65" and then "javaws https://192.168.x.1/admin/public/asdm.jnlp" and it installed just fine. http://www.jenv.be/
