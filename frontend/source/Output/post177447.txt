Apple Macbook Moving Desktop Files, Folders, Icons <body> When I go to organize my desktop by moving multiple Files, Folders, or Icons at the same time it groups them all together. How to I prevent it from doing this?  Thank you.

The intention is that you need to be able to see your drag target, so it tidies them into a bundle.
