What does Terminal.app store in iCloud? <body> I just noticed this. What does Terminal.app store in iCloud? img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uGQTB.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer219842> Terminal.app stores your preference options on iCloud (basically things like the font and background colours)  Specifically its a copy of  preference file code"com.Apple.Terminal.plist"/code in codeUsers/&lt;yourusername&gt;/Library/Preferences/code  <comment265441> Perhaps the command history. But this is only a guess. <comment265527> Command history gets stored in the .history file. <comment265835> That's interesting, I'm updated to latest OS and don't have Terminal.app in that list. <comment265855> It's quite odd, I don't see Terminal.app in my iCloud preferences. Maybe it's an app, using Terminal.app as an interface to store files in iCloud. <comment265869> Terminal doesn't explicitly store anything in iCloud. Please consider filing a bug report with Apple about it appearing in the list: https://developer.apple.com/bug-reporting/ <comment265909> I voted this up, but I'm not so sure this synchronizes. In terminal if I run `brctl status | grep -i terminal` I see no containers and I have changed the terminal preferences to open non-white colored windows. I do have Terminal listed in the preference pane, but one Mac has 128 lines in the plist and the other has 658 lines as measured by `defaults read com.Apple.Terminal.plist|wc -l` - Can you elaborate on how these preferences are syncing? I am seeing zero items in common between two Macs that have iCloud Drive on and the preferences are clearly not the same on both Macs. <comment265929> My preferences file isnâ€™t stored in iCloud. Terminal does not appear in the list of apps that save documents to iCloud, and my `~/Library/Mobile Documents` folder does not show Terminal either.
