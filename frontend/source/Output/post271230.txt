Contact App crashing on macOS <body> For the past year my Contact app has been crashing:  ul liseveral times a day/li liwith or without accessing it at the point of crash/li /ul  My OS is ALWAYS up to date, and I am enrolled in the public beta program.   Any suggestions ?  Thanks !  <comment340933> Maybe try looking in the *Console*? <comment340942> Are you running a Beta version of macOS? BTW/ which version of macOS is running? <comment340954> @edric : eum, yes and what would I see in the console ? <comment340955> @icondaemon : yes, but I have the same issue even when I ran the non beta versions...and since months now, so it's not tied to a specific version <comment341001> Is the app's data wholly contained (ie: not linked to other contacts servers like Google & whatnot?) <comment341082> No, the app is linked to exchange, iCloud, Gmail, LinkedIn
