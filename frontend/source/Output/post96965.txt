Xcode 4.6 hangs at startup <body> Upon opening Xcode, without given the option to do anything else, it opens a blank editor window showing "no selection" with a spinning activity indicator. It then takes up 100% of the CPU for a few minutes until I force quit. How can I stop it from acting like this? I have tried reinstalling and deleting all its cached items and local data.  <answer97012> Deleting a bunch of old certificates and keys from the keychain fixes it in my case.

In 8 hours I will add that as the answer.  Reference: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3752773?start=0&tstart=0
