mountain-lion file associations are reset <body> I just upgraded from 10.6 to 10.8 a few days ago.  I notice that every now and then my file associations are reset on start-up.  I get a message from chrome that it is no longer the default browser.  My media files get associated to esoteric video editing software.  I can't figure out what is causing this issue.  For example, I checked to see which of my browsers was the new default browser.  To my surprise it was Safari - I say to my surprise, because I've never used safari.  I use chrome for browsing and firefox for development.  The same thing with my media files, they get associated to an application that I've never used.  I don't even know where to start looking.  Thanks in advance!  <comment85574> Try [rebuilding the Launch Services database](http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20031215144430486) or looking at system.log (or all messages in Console).
