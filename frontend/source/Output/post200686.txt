Snapping Preview windows with BetterTouchTool make search buggy <body> I use BetterTouchTool in order to be able to maximise windows to half the screen by dragging them agains the edge of the screen. When I do this with Preview windows and then attempt to search in the document, the user interface gets messed up, so I have no codeDone/code button to get rid of the search results. See below gif for illustration. There should be a codeDone/code button at the upper right.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y5wyt.gif" alt="enter image description here"  Can anybody confirm this weirdness? Is this a BTT bug or can I do anything myself?  <answer200778> If you uninstall this software does Preview behave?  It is likely an interaction with Preview and this software. And emmaybe/em something else on your system. I would suggest contacting support on this product directly.
