How can I play the sound from the audio in through my speakers? <body> I have got a Macbook Pro 15" that has both an audio in and out port. Now I would like to play the sound from an external device through the speakers of my Mac.   How can I do that? I tried to just plug in the 3.5mm cable from my external device into the audio in port but I simply cannot make my Mac play the sound. However, in System Preferences - Sound - Input I can see that the Mac is receiving the signals.   What can I do?  <answer112131> You can use GarageBand:  ol liCreate a new project and choose for example the voice template/li liSet Monitor to On  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/d4Wvv.png" alt=""/li liOptionally remove the effects from the Edit tab/li /ol  <answer112133> If you don't have Garageband installed you can also use Quicktime.  ol liOpen Quicktime/li liGo to codeFile -&gt; New Audio Recording/code. You will see the following screen: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7SlpX.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liClick on the little triangle on the right and choose codeBuilt-in Input: Line in/code as shown in the screenshot./li liSlide the volume under the record button up until you have the desired loudness./li /ol  <comment343740> For me this imposes about 300ms input delay. Is there a way to adjust that delay (perhaps by means of some ´defaults´ setting for QuickTime)? <comment343804> Don't think you can configure QuickTime, it sounds like a latency problem What device are you connecting?
