LSOpenURLsWithRole() failed with error 10810 in iTerm2 running tmux on Yosemite <body> precode[~%]open ~/Pictures/upload.png LSOpenURLsWithRole() failed with error -10810 for the file /Users/bryanhunt/Pictures/upload.png. /code/pre  Before this update I used to be able to open images, PDFs, etc. from the command line.   Now I have to open the directory, and click on the file to open it, which is a waste of my finger strength.   Anyone know how to make it work again?  <answer167938> The fix.  Install homebrew.  Install reattach-to-user-namespace:  precode brew install reattach-to-user-namespace /code/pre  Then create an alias which your shell can use:  precode alias open='reattach-to-user-namespace open' /code/pre  <comment196683> What update are you referring to? Yosemite? iTerm2? tmux? <comment196707> Here is a similar question on SuperUser. Perhaps one of these answers would work for you. http://superuser.com/questions/834525/unable-to-launch-application-in-tmux <comment196951> That looks like the best bet, looks like it is only a problem for tmux users. <comment196955> Yeah it works, ugly hack going on there :) <comment196959> Why does this work? and brew is not part of OS X <comment197280> @Mark You sohuld read about *Bootstrap Namespaces* here: https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn2083/_index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS10003794-CH1-SECTION9 . There's common problem for devs when they want to launch GUI app from daemon for example. That's why when running `tmux` You have to attach to *User* namespace in order to be able to "talk" to proper launchd.
