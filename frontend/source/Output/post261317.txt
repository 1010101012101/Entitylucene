How can I back up an iPhone with a broken screen? <body> I plugged my iPhone 5c (screen is broken, totally black) into my MBP and iTunes says:      To allow access, please respond on your iPhone.   I can't respond on my iPhone, because I can't see any prompt, and I have no clue whether the touch sensing even works anyway.  What are my options now?
