iPhone 7 always shuffling music <body> My music is stuck on Shuffle mode. I cannot "unblock" the shuffle. It's greyed out on the screen and I cannot either make it blue (active) or inactivate it. It's always shuffling.  <comment362733> What version of iOS are you on? Could you please attach a screenshot?
