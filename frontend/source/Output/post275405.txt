Itunes 12.5.5.5 Can no longer subscribe to or download podcasts <body> Ever since updating to iTunes 12.5.5.5 on Windows Pro 7, I can no longer subscribe to any podcasts or download any episodes. The buttons are emnot/em grayed out. When I click them, I can see them "being pushed". It's just that nothing happens.  Additionally, before, when I connected my iPod, a list of the podcasts I am subscribed to would appear and I could simply download episodes I hadn't downloaded yet and then drag those to my iPod. This is no longer possible either.  Quite an issue for me, so any help is greatly appreciated.  <comment346452> Welcome to Ask Different!  How long has this been going on?  I'm asking because there's been a recent problem on the App Store with intermittent problems downloading apps and it might affect podcasts, too. <comment346459> I only use iTunes like once a month so I can't really tell say :/ <comment346461> Can you just subscribe to the podcasts from your iPod? <comment346470> Lol I hadn't tried that yet. My iPod is about 10 years old. I don't think it's been online in years :D But I just tried and while I can find podcasts and download episodes, there's simply no subscribe button to click. <comment346473> Ok, it might be a good idea to update your question with that info as well as the model of iPod and the version of iOS.  That would help prevent people from suggesting the same thing I just did.
