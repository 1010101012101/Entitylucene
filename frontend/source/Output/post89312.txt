Select all hyperlinks in Pages <body> Is it possible to select all of the hyperlinks in a document?  I want to change the colours for every link in the document but it seems a bit odd that i have to go through all of them manually.  <answer89342> There is no easy way to select all the Hyperlinks all at once, but what you can do is use the Styles Drawer to create a custom Style so that you can apply it very quickly to you hyperlinks.  To use the Styles Drawer to create a custom style follow these steps:  ol liIn the Pages menu bar click on View  Show Styles Drawer./li liHighlight the Hyperlink with the correct color./li liUnder the Character Styles click on the dropdown arrow and select "Create New Character Style from Selection"/li liName the Style accordingly./li liAfter that click on any hyperlink in which you would like to apply the style and click on the style./li /ol  <comment104782> @Common-Courtesy what about...
