8 GB on MacBook Pro (13", 2.26 ghz) <body> The Apple specs say the 13" MacBook Pro supports up to 8GB of RAM. I have a 2.26GHz 13" one, and would really want to use this.  Has anyone tried this before? What is the maximum memory recommended, to be "safe"?  <answer2288> I have a 2.4-GHz 13-inch MacBook Pro, which is virtually the same as your model. It has 8GB of RAM. No problems thus far.  <comment1949> Great! 8GB, here I come... <comment2069> +agreed... should be no problems whatsoever as long as the memory isn't radically different from what your machine can handle <comment6053> Any suggested brands for Apple compatible RAM or at least a preference? <comment6054> @Ryan Wersal: Hmm... Not really, to be honest. I usually get Corsair, Crucial, G.SKILL, or Mushkin.
