iCloud account from parents to my own cloud <body> I am a college student and every time I log onto my iPad it says my iCloud storage is almost full. However, I know the storage being added to the iCloud is not all mine. Is their a way I can get my own cloud but still use my parents Apple ID?    <comment186982> There a multiple accounts in each iDevice that can use an applid to log in, for example iMessage, Facetime and iCloud all have there own credentials.  There is also now Family Sharing, which allows you to have separate accounts but still share purchases.  First thing to do is go to Settings  iCloud  Storage  Manage Storage and see what is using your storage.   It's possible if you changed devices in the past there is a backup sitting there that you don't need anymore.
