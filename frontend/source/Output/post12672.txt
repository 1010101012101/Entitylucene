AppleScript app started prompting to run or quit. How can I disable this? <body> I'm not entirely sure why this has started happening since this is completely new behaviour and I haven't done any system updates but I have a nice little toolbar app for my Snow Leopard Finder.app that opens the existing folder/or files in TextMate.  It used to simply bring up TextMate with the chosen content but since today it instead gives me a prompt asking me to run or quit the script.  Here is what the popup looks like: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gJ8Pn.png" alt="Script popup"  Nowâ€¦ this app/script isn't new, I trust the script and I don't want this popup everytime I use it.  So 2 questions:  ol liHow do I disable this annoying prompt?/li liWhy am I all of a sudden getting it when yesterday everything was working fine?/li /ol  Any insight would be much appreciated.  For reference the script in question is this one: OpenInTextMate However the MateDot.app script I was using also is doing the same thing.  Thanks for reading.

As long as the AppleScript script-application in question wasn't saved with the codeRun Only/code option (see the image above), you should be able to open the script in AppleScript Editor by dragging the script-application's icon onto AppleScript Editor's icon. (When a script is saved as codeRun Only/code, AppleScript Editor won't allow you to open it to see the source code). So, if you are able to open it OK, then you could Save a copy of it and make sure the codeStartup Screen/code option is disabled.  As for why this suddenly started happening when yesterday it didn't, I'm not sure. What version of OS X are you using?  <answer284791> I know this is old - but it happened to me today on macOS Sierra 10.12.4.  Based on this page I solved it be running codechmod +rw applet.rsrc/code in the em/Contents/Resources/em folder under the applet.  Strangely enough, codels -l/code looks identical before and after codechmod +rw applet.rsrc/code, but the prompt has stopped appearing.  <comment13342> Hi, my OSX version is 10.6.6. I am able to open the script and resaved it. It works again now. Many thanks.
