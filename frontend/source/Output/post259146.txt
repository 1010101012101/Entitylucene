Ping cannot resolve .io domains yet nslookup can <body> macOS 10.12.1 (16B2555) on an early 2015 Macbook Pro.  I can't resolve any code.io/code domains on this machine.  Other people on the same network can.  This happens here at the office, and at home.  I've tried different browsers, I've turned it off and on again.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4LLMs.png" alt="enter image description here"  precode[~]$ nslookup ngrok.io Server:     10.15.0.1 Address:    10.15.0.1#53  Non-authoritative answer: Name:   ngrok.io Address: 52.25.124.181 Name:   ngrok.io Address: 52.41.214.241 Name:   ngrok.io Address: 54.68.226.153  [~]$ ping ngrok.io ping: cannot resolve ngrok.io: Unknown host /code/pre  If I add the domain manually to code/etc/hosts/code, and then run a traceroute, I don't see anything abnormal.  I'm able to bring up the domain in a browser.  Definitely seems like a DNS issue, however, I'm not using DNS settings that are any different from anyone else on either my home or work network.  If I change the DNS servers manually to code8.8.8.8/code, it STILL does not work.  <answer259382> You may have been impacted by recent issues of a portion of the .io TLD Nameservers delivering NXDOMAIN responses which then cascaded throughout all DNS entries globally.  Only a portion of the nameservers were doing this, leading to discrepancies in the cached values downstream, which in turn lead to intermittent failure to lookup the host server when making requests.  <comment324155> When you say "it happens here and at home" I am assuming it's on the same machine  (like a MacBook), correct?  How do you have your IP setup?  Full DHCP or are you making some manual settings? <comment324158> DHCP on both networks, same macbook <comment324159> Can you flush your DNS; issue the command:  `sudo dscacheutil -flushcache;sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder;say cache flushed` <comment324165> No change at all :( <comment324515> Looks to be similar to http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/24018/dns-lookups-fail-with-e-g-ping-but-work-with-host but, I don't know if the same fix would apply to 10.12 or not
