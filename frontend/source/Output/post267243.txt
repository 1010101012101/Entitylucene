Access Mac localhost from Windows parallels <body> So there is a web appliance running on my Mac localhost. I want to check how it looks in Internet Explorer. I have Parallels Desktop 12 running Windows 10 with installed Parallels tools.   However, if I run IE in Coherence, it still cannot load localhost. I tried to set up IP of my mac to code10.0.0.45/code (because I know my router gives IP in this range) and then accessing codehttp://10.0.0.45/code from parallels IE  While this worked, I would like to know if there is better process to do that  <comment335250> localhost is the machine you are running on so in this case it is theBVM the MacOS is a different machine so you use an assigned IP address as you have done <comment335251> I see. Currently in "overthinking everything" mode. Thank you :)
