SophosAV slows the dictionary pop-up <body> I've got the virus scanner from Sophos installed on my Mac with on-access-scan enabled.  strongThe on-access-scan delays the dictionary pop-up for several seconds for every emfirst/em prompt after boot up./strong  You can prompt the dictionary pop-up by using either kbdctrl/kbd+kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbdD/kbd or three fingers double-tab.  I can choose to disable on-access-scan for code/Applications/Dictionary.app/code in the SophosAV preferences. However, this does not solve the problem. What should I do?  <answer39384> I'm stupid.

In the Sophos preferences you need to exclude the following locations from your on-access-scan:  precode 1. /Library/Dictionaries   2. /Users/your_username/Library/Dictionaries /code/pre
