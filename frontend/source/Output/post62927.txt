sync 2 phones without transferring each others information <body> I have 2 Iphones for 2 separate users in the house. Setup individually for their own accounts. When synced on the computer all the apps from one phone went on the other phone which the other user does not want. How do I prevent this from happening. Also now my user name is now on the other phone.
