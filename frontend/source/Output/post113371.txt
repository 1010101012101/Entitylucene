Is the iBooks app sandboxed on Mavericks? <body> I would like to know if ibooks app on Mavericks is sandboxed.  I might read some unsecure ebooks (from internet).  <answer113373> Yes it is sandboxed.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YxbKP.png" alt="iBooks as shown in Activity Monitor with &quot;Sandbox&quot; == &quot;Yes&quot;"  â€¦so you should be fine to read books out of the Internet.  <comment133010> Thanks i know where to look now if i want to know about any other app
