recover my calendar appointments <body> I was entering a new appointment on my Iphone6 and was interrupted by a phone call. After the call I went back to check my calendar and all of my existing appointments had disappeared. They first appeared then disappeared. What happened and how do I recover my appointments?  <comment238222> Open Calender and press "Calenders" just above the home button, and make sure the correct calenders are enabled.  Most people don't realize that there are multiple calendars. <comment238252> also try in the "Calendars" Menu to pull down to force a refresh :)
