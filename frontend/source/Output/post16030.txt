How can I setup my printer to print in black and white as default? <body> Is it possible to set up a printer, so it will always print in black and white?  <answer16036> You can define a preset from the print dialog. First change the settings for what you want, and then choose the Presets  Save Asâ€¦ menu.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zar0g.png" alt="enter image description here"  If you leave your preset selected, it will be selected the next time also, so you will never have to change it.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MLwLI.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer37568> @ughoavgfhw's answer is incomplete. Some applications (like Google Chrome) will not use the last used preset, but will use the default preset. In order to have such applications adhere to your default settings, you have to interact with the underlying printing system CUPS. These steps will get you there:  ol liRun codecupsctl WebInterface=yes/code using the Terminal application (only required once)./li liBrowse to codehttp://localhost:631//code/li liGo to Printers/li liSelect printer to modify/li liChoose codeSet Default Options/code from the second drop-down/li liUnder codeBasic/code set codeOutput color/code to codeBlack/code (this step might be different for your printer)/li liHit codeSet Default Options/code and presto!/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/e5we3.png" alt="Set Default Options"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zW4lp.png" alt="Set output color to black"  <comment17486> I don't see any options for that: http://cl.ly/7eXd http://cl.ly/7fWc <comment17488> @Tyilo It's in the Presets menu, just under the printer selection menu. <comment17489> Oh my god, I'm stupid :P <comment42630> This will not work for Google Chrome; Chrome will always use the default preset, not the last one used. <comment161026> awesome.... thanks a lot.. <comment205247> is there a way to do this strictly from the terminal ? <comment287680> This depends on the printer driver in later versions of os-x. Many companies notably Canon do not provide a black and white option (greedy bastards). The only option is then to set it via CUPs. <comment345021> When clicking "Set Default Options" I was prompted for a username/password with no explanation. After some confusion, entering my local Mac username (which has Admin privileges) and password worked.
