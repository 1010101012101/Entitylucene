How can I move my iPod music to an iPad? <body> How can I get the songs out of my iPod and move them to an iPad?   I thought I could just copy the music to my computer and then transfer it to the iPad, but didn't work (I couldn't see any music file on my iPod). Any other methods?  <answer52671> Check this out: How-to: get music, videos, and photos off your iPod or iPhone.  After you get the music off of your ipod and into your computer/itunes you can just sync it normally to your ipad, or any other idevice for that matter.  <answer52673> Try synchronising your iPod to your computer through iTunes and then synchronising your iPad to iTunes on the same computer.  Music files on the iPod are usually seen as jargon and you cannot usually tell which song is which. It is a safer bet to sync using iTunes.  <answer61867> First of all, please make sure that iTunes is set to emmanually manage music/em.
