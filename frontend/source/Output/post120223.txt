Cannot decrypt GPG file after installing GPG Suite from GPG Tools <body> I have installed GPG Suite by GPG Tools on my Mac. I sent my public key to my associate, who encrypted a file and sent it to me. The file, codemyfile.gpg/code is now sitting on my desktop and I'm told by my associate that I just have to double-click on it, enter my private key, and the file will be decrypted. Sounds reasonable, but it doesn't work.  I double-click on codemyfile.gpg/code and OS X reports there is no application to open the file. I restarted my Mac and the problem still exists.  Do I need to manually setup a file association?   What am I doing wrong?  Thank you.  <answer120249> h1Assigning Files/h1  Your Mac should have an association with a *.gpg file.  The appropiate service is named codeGPGServices.service/code and can be found in code/Library/Services//code. To manually assign the file extension to a application or service click on the myfile.gpg and then kbdCMD/kbd+kbdI/kbd.  Now you can chose a application with which the file should be open with.img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rY4NX.png" alt="File Info"  If you click and hold the drop down menu, chose "Other ..." and a dialog will open. Click kbdCMD/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbdG/kbd and type code/Library/Services/code. Chose codeGPGServices.service/code, change for all and close the Info window. If you can't find GPGServices you may have a corrupted or old installation. In this case install the GPG Suite again.  h1Decrypting with a terminal/h1  To decrypt the file you can also use a Terminal.   Open Spotlight and type "Terminal.app"(or open a Finder  Applications  Utilities  Terminal.app) and click on it. You will see the command line. Type codegpg -d/code(mind the space after code-d/code) and drag the file into the terminal. Hit enter and you will be asked for you password.  h2Example/h2  precodegpg -d myfile.gpg /code/pre
