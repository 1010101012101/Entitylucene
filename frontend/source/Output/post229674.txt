10.11: Good Samaritan message not showing on Filevault2 unlock screen <body> You can set up a lock Message under codeSystem Preferences =&gt; Security &amp; Privacy =&gt; General =&gt; Set Lock Message./codebr This Message is stored in NVRAM. Under 10.9 Mavericks it was not only shown on Login/Fast User switch window but also on the FileVault2 Login Screen after a cold boot which makes a whole lot of sense. On 10.11 El Capitan this feature is gone. The Message is only shown on the normal Login/Fast User switch window after the machine has already been unlocked.br Is there a way to revert 10.9 behaviour?  <answer229765> I fixed it myself by updating my user picture under codeSystem Preferences =&gt; Users &amp; Groups/code emafter/em setting the Lock Message. Now it appears again on FileVault2 Screen  <comment280556> Awesome! Please mark this as answered
