iPad mini 4 restarts itself when shaken <body> Today I just noticed that my iPad mini 4 restarts itself when shaken. I started to notice it first today when I took off its clear case to clean the back. I also noticed that when I hard reset it sometimes a gold (sometimes white and gray) colored screen flashes before restarting itself. What could be the cause of this problem?  BTW/ the iPad mini 4 is a 16gb wifi model and running on the latest version of iOS (10.2.1)  Any help would be greatly appreciated.   <answer273178> This is definitely an hardware issue. The first thing I would suggest is to stop shaking it! :) What ever loose connector you have there might stay loose which will force you to take it to apple \ local repair store.  I think it's better to take it for a repair now. I will be a lot easier for the repair guy to find the problem while it is still half working.  <comment342850> Sounds like a hardware problem (battery connector loose, probably). If you need it fixed, bring it to an Apple Store or talk to Apple at https://getsupport.apple.com
