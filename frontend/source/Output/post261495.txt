`ls` is printing vertically instead of horizontally <body> First off, there is a similar question posted on stack overflow. I followed the suggestions, but it didn't solve my issue. See the link below:     https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23849229/why-ls-list-multiple-files-per-line-but-ls-pipe-redirect-list-just-1-file-p   When entering codels/code into the terminal, the expected output should look like this:  precodeDesktop       Documents   Downloads   Library   Pictures Applications  Movies      Music       Public    Videos /code/pre  However, my output appears like I'm using codels -l/code instead of codels/code:  precodeDesktop        Documents Downloads Library Pictures Applications Movies Music Public Videos /code/pre  How can I get my output to look like the first example when entering codels/code? I've seen some people using codels -C/code, but this didn't work either. Any help will be much appreciated.  <comment327428> `ls` attempts to fit the output in to what it thinks the terminal width happens to be when you run it. It looks at `COLUMNS` specifically. What does `echo $COLUMNS` say in your shell when `ls` is behaving this way? <comment327430> @BlueFox, What does the output for `alias` show in Terminal, do you have an _alias_ defined for `ls`? <comment327538> @lanC, `echo $COLUMNS` outputs `80`, which is the default size. When I increase the column size, the `ls` does not change. It remains the same. <comment327539> @user3439894, the only alias I have for `ls` is `ls -Gh`. I removed this alias, but it doesn't appear to affect the appearance of the list.
