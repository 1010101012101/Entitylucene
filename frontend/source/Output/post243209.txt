Font size problem <body> I accidentally hit command/underline and it made the print super tiny.  I tried doing command/z to go back and it didn't work.  I'm a 73 grandma and bit challenged technologically.  Can you help?  <answer243212> I'm assuming you mean in a 'text' or web scenario...  The standard controls for font/view resizing arebr kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd - [minus] /kbd (which is, in effect, command/underline)br to reduce the view/fontbr &amp;br kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd + [plus] /kbdbr to increase it.  You can change your 'zoom' level by hitting either of those until your view is to your satisfaction.
