Can't change startup disk iMac <body> Here is my situation: I've only the mouse paired with my iMac because I rent the keyboard to a friend. Unfortunately the startup disk is set to a fallacious Windows partition that don't want to boot. It sucks on "No bootable device -- insert boot disk and press any key" so I can't boot in any working partition. So, I've two questions:  ul liThere is a way to change boot partition or to go to recovery using only mouse?/li liIf I buy a standard usb keyboard, can I just plug the usb cable and use it to change the boot partition or it won't boot, because of the drivers?/li /ul  <answer168958> ol liI think you need a keyboard to boot holding kbdAlt/kbd ("Option") key, to show boot partition and disks. /li liYes, if you plug in a USB keyboard it simply works. Mac OS X has the driver for standard keyboards. /li /ol  <comment198375> Thank you. Solved with a usb keyboard
