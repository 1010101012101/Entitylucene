TextMate : Keeping my KeyBindings after an update <body> I'm using TextMate 2 with some custom KeyBindings. I change them in code/Applications/TextMate.app/Contents/Resources/KeyBindings.dict/code. It works great, but everytime I update them app they get reset. (I guess the update replace the whole .app).   Any suggestion how I could prevent that (= not set again my keybindings).    <answer117018> Under MacroMates' keyBindings page is written:     In addition TextMate has a code/path/‍to/‍TextMate.app/‍Contents/‍Resources/‍KeyBindings.dict/code file with some extra key bindings which are specific to TextMate (and thus not appropriate to put in the per user global key bindings file). strongYou can copy this file to/strong code~/Library/‍Application Support/‍TextMate/code    strongand edit it, this will then take precedence over the bundled file./strong   As this file won't be replaced during the Application's emupdate/em, your keybindings will remain.  strongNote/strong: As Matthieu points out, you will need to rename the file to codeDefaultKeyBinding.dict/code to make it work.  <comment137017> I had to rename it `DefaultKeyBinding.dict` to make it work. You should edit your answer which wasn't clear on that ;)
