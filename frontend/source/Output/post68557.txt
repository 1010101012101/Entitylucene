How to map PageDown to Option? <body> I have not been able to figure out how to map kbdPageDown/kbd to kbdOption/kbd. I have KeyRemap4MacBook installed, but the options they have in the "Change Key" pane don't allow me to do this.  How can I map kbdPageDown/kbd to kbdOption/kbd?  <answer68576> Try saving something like this as private.xml:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt; &lt;item&gt; &lt;name&gt;test&lt;/name&gt; &lt;identifier&gt;private.test&lt;/identifier&gt; &lt;autogen&gt;--KeyToKey-- KeyCode::PAGEDOWN, KeyCode::OPTION_L, VK_OPTION&lt;/autogen&gt; &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  I'm not sure, but it might not work if you don't have another keyboard with an option key connected.  If codeKeyCode::PAGEDOWN/code doesn't work, you can see the key code constants in the source and the hexadecimal key codes with Key Codes.  The test folder has an XML file with all the predefined remappings.   <comment79633> I have a Kinesis Advantage, there is no Option or Alt key on the right side for the thumb. There are PageUp/Down keys, so I want to use them as Option/Alt. Given the unusual layout of the Kinesis, this makes a lot of sense. <comment79655> OHHHH i totally thought you meant you wanted to turn option into page down lol. My bad _ <comment79739> That did it, thank you!
