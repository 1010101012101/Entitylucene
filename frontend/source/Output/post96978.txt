Is my SATA cable damaged? <body> Macbook Pro Mid 2012, original SSD.  TLDR; Why could I clone my unmountable drive from an external enclosure but not internally?  My SSD broke down a few days ago. It was detected, but I was unable to mount it, and I got I/O errors when trying to clone (restore in Disk Utility) the drive (no logs saved). After Disk Utility and DiskWarrior failed to resolve the issue I put the internal SSD into an external enclosure. From the enclosure I was suddenly able to clone the drive. My question is, what possible explanations for this are there? My guess is that the SATA connector is damaged, but I hope I'm wrong.  Update: A fresh install (made from the external enclosure) still has the same mounting issues when booted internally.   Update 2: After a few more hours of research I'm more or less convinced that the cable is toast. Apparently it's a common occurrence with certain Macbook models.   <answer97473> I replaced the cable, and everything is now back to normal. So, as I suspected, the cable was the culprit.  Instructions on how to replace the SATA cable is easily found online   (search for things like codereplace hard drive cable macbook/code).  The only tricky part was to connect the sleep LED to the cable, but if you just check how the old cable is connected you'll be fine.  <comment113806> It could be the cable or any other part related to the HDD really. A cable might be the easiest thing to try and replace, of course <comment114275> Another indicator of a dying SATA cable is that the sleeping LED on a MBP stops working. The LED is on the same ribbon as the SATA.
