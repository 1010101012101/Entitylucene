Shell command to count pages in a PDF (other than pdftk)? <body> I have been using this to get a page count of PDFs in shell scripts in OS X:  codepdftk "$i" dump_data | grep NumberOfPages | awk '{print $2}' | tr -dc '[0-9]'/code  (where code$i/code is the PDF filename)  However, there are times when that does not seem to work, so I would like to find another way to do it.  <answer198855> You should be able to use codemdls/code to view the metadata attributes for a PDF:  codemdls -n kMDItemNumberOfPages "$i" | cut -c24-/code   <answer198860> Whether the file is indexed or not this works however if the target file does not resides on a volume/location that's being indexed then here is an alternative to the excellent solution presented by jordanmerrick.  I just tried this using exiftool and if it's just the page count you want as a number then this works:  precodeexiftool "$i" | grep 'Page Count' | cut -c35- /code/pre  <answer245641> mdls did not work for me either.  I did this on a Mac, but I expect it'll be the same on any bash or similar shell.  With the Mac I have homebrew already installed so I just typed the command "homebrew install exiftool" first.  Here is the script I ran, you can set it up for your purposes.  I had a whole folder of PDF files and I wanted page counts on every one of them so I had it look through the files and print out the filename and page with a , in between  precode#!/bin/sh  FILES=/path/to/files/* for f in $FILES do     fn=$(basename "$f")     printf "$fn"     pg=$(exiftool "$f" | grep 'Page Count' | cut -c35-)     printf ",$pg\n" done /code/pre  <answer245649> Yet another codeexiftool/code solution:  precodecd /path/to/pdf/directory exiftool -T -filename -PageCount -s3 -ext pdf . /code/pre  <comment238133> Note: This solution only works if the target file resides on a volume/location that's being indexed.  Personally, I have some locations excluded so for me this would not work in some cases.  That said, it's a better way then having to pipe it so many times like shown in the OP. It's worth a +1 though! :) <comment238168> Even easier: `mdls -raw -name kMDItemNumberOfPages` I didn't realize there was an attribute for this. All of my files are on indexed HFS+ devices, so that will work fine. <comment352806> This one is very good IMHO. It (1) is simple (2) produces a clean output: file name [spaces] page count (3) can process all pdf files in a dir even if there are other files (4) will probably work on computer with different locales (5) is portable to other systems (using it on Linux).
