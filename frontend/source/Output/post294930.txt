Prevent certain application from being executed on macOS 10.12.6 <body> How can I prevent a certain application (ie. the Tor Browser) from being executed on macOS 10.12.6? Is there a way to blacklist the application by its signature, or will I have to go another way? If there's an approach by programming manually, some hints and tips where to investigate further would be much appreciated.  Some more details:br Itâ€™s a single-user home Mac; however this user account needs the maximum level of privileges/permissions possible, because it is used for light development work.  <comment372217> added details above <comment372218> If you are the only user and I'd tell you how to disable Tor Browser or another app (e.g. remove the executable bit), you could simply revert/undo the restriction by looking at the answer here...somehow unclear what you are asking...
