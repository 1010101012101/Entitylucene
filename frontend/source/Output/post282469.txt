Apple Software iPhone 5s <body> My iPhone 5s will not let me add events to my calendar.  Where can I look to fix this problem?   I have tried changing or deleting my calendar settings.  <comment355848> Hi Sandra, and welcome to Ask Different! On this site, it helps the community if you add as many details as possible to the question. Could you please add your iOS version as well as screenshots of what's happening? Thanks! (also, if you haven't tried a full reboot - slide to power off - please do so now)
