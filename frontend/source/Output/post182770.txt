Change window keyboard shortcut <body> So there's this gesture on touchpads where you move 4 fingers downward so you change between multiple windows of the same application. I'm working on an iMac now, so I don't have a touchpad, is there any keyboard command (or maybe a gesture on the magic mouse) to produce this?  <answer182771> By default, the shortcut is kbdControl/kbd+kbdDown/kbd.  <comment217695> ....I love you ;-; <comment217699> Also, after control + down, how do I change between them using the keyboard? arrows keys don't seem to work
