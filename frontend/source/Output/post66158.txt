I was trying to use port 8080 for some testing and I received the error that another process was already listening on it. My invocation of codenmap/code returned different results depending on whether I was using codesudo/code or not. This did not make sense to me.  I was really concerned when I could not figure out what was processes were listening on these ports using codesudo lsof -P -n -iTCP | grep LIST/code. This led me to believe that there was malicious software intentionally hiding itself.  I ended up removing files from code/Library/LaunchDaemons//code until I narrowed it down to the culprit. The application responsible for all these opened ports was the Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobile Client. Unfortunately, in order for this Cisco VPN client to work, it must have all these ports opened. Apparently, it is also responsible for the firewall rule addition that you reported with codeipfw show/code.  It still boggles my mind why it does not show which process is responsible for the open ports when using codelsof/code. No application should be able to avoid being listed using this method. Perhaps the reason for the process not being listed will be answered in another stackexchange question.  <answer216889> I ran into this problem this morning, complained on Twitter, and was told that the problem has been fixed in recent versions of Any Connect.  I upgraded to the new version, and I no longer have a mystery process binding to port 8080.  So good so far.  <comment77849> Install Little Snitch and try the steps again. I am not sure if it works for listening processes, maybe someone else can confirm that. <comment77937> Installed LittleSnitch: it didn't report anything regarding access to localhost:8080. <comment92668> Thanks! I actually have Cisco AnyConnect installed ... AnyConnect also installs a Kernel extension that is most likely the cause of not being able to see any process. <comment116434> I got the same exact issue but with port 80:  http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/99068/rogue-process-occupying-port-80.  Why didn't Cisco allocate another port?? <comment261684> I actually didn't have Cisco client installed, but I *used to have*. I found out by sending requests to port 8080, which `sudo lsof -i -P  | grep 8080` showed as going to one ip I didn't recognise, and `ifconfig | grep that` showed it was interface en4. That interface was something Cisco VPN had set up, and it was there even though Cisco VPN has already been uninstalled.
