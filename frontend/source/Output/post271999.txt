How to Share iPhone Home Video Files <body> As you may be aware, iPhone has its resident Camera Roll App which are shareable and Home Video App files synced from iTunes. How can I share Home Video App files?  <comment341896> You really need to clarify your question because it's not at all clear what you're actually asking how to do. Are you wanting to share videos taken on your iPhone? If so, are you wanting to share them from your iPhone directly, or from your Mac? Or are you wanting to share other _home videos_?  Or is it something else? And while you've used the _El Capitan_ tag, that doesn't tell us what version of iOS you have running on your iPhone and that also makes a difference.
