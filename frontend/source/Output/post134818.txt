Enter user/pass dialog for acrobat app install: no text visible, can't type into text boxes / press buttons (pic) <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YAwUs.jpg" alt="No text visible, can&#39;t enter user/pass or hit &#39;cancel&#39; or &#39;ok&#39;"  Has anyone ever seen this? I wish I could describe it better, but I hoped the picture could do the talking.  This is on a clients computer, running Mavericks, and as you can see trying to install Acrobat.  This dialog box pops up, which would normally ask you to enter your username and password, but instead no text is visible, and you can't enter text or click any buttons.  <answer146009> We've experienced one of these empty dialog / password request buttons. It appears when installing any types of software it seems (such as Vectorworks for example),  If you type in your normal password (the text won't show up), it will go away.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kKhrb.png" alt=""  <comment159696> Oh adobe, your installers are legend... I'll see if I can dig up a blog post on the troubles excellent sys admin are reporting with the current batch of installers from Adobe and answer. I have strong suspicions it's the installer but don't want to answer prematurely. Hopefully this comment helps you narrow your search for a cause. <comment172072> Welcome to Ask Different!
