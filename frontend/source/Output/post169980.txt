How to disable that “Guest User” from appearing at the OS X 10.8.5 login screen <body> I have removed the "guest user" account by: System Preferences → Users &amp; groups → Guest User → Remove.  It still remains as an option under users (but states disabled).  It still shows up on login screen and if selected allows guest to logon to computer.  How do I remove guest login completely so that is is not even an option at login?  <answer169990> I no longer have an OS 10.8 Mavericks system to test on, but I think from your description that you had a real user account named "Guest" and deleted it. That enables the special Guest account, the one that's automatically created on each login and destroyed on each logout.  To disable that one, go back to System Preferences → Users &amp; Groups → Guest User (he's baaack...), and uncheck "Allow guests to log in to this computer".  <answer224547> code sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.AppleFileServer guestAccess -bool NO sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.smb.server AllowGuestAccess -bool NO /code  <answer230766> If you want to remove the Guest User from the login screen ,you should visit this site. https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204012 It has instructions on how to enable and disable the Guest User.  precode-From the Apple menu choose System Preferences. -From the View menu choose Users &amp; Groups. -Click on the lock and authenticate with an administrator account. -Click Login Options. -Click the Edit button or Join button. -Click the Open Directory Utility button. -Click the lock in the Directory Utility window. -Enter an administrator account name and password, then click OK. -Choose Disable Root User from the Edit menu.  /code/pre  <answer230767> How to disable that “Guest User” from appearing at the OS X login screen  h2For modern versions of OS X, disabling Guest account is done as follows: /h2  br (I have provided a screenshot from El Capitan, but Yosemite is very similar) br  ol liOpen System Preferences/li liGo to “Users &amp; Groups” and click the unlock icon/li liClick on “Guest User”/li liUncheck the box for ‘Allow guests to log in to this computer’ /li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zt4kh.png" alt="enter image description here" strongemThe key here is everything must be disabled./em/strong  Once you completely disable the account, it will no longer show up on the login screen.

Maybe you do have a normal user named `Guest` and haven't deleted it. In Terminal, the command `id guest` should return something that begins with `id=201(Guest gid=201(_guest) groups=...`. If you get a different id, one bigger than 500, then the Guest user you're seeing is a regular user. Also, if you're using FileVault, the list you see is the list of users who can decrypt the boot disk. That may include users who no longer exist. What happens if you log in as Guest? What do you see when Fast User Switching? <comment281706> That link takes you to ***Enabling and Using the ROOT user account*** not the guest account like was asked in the OP <comment281707> Yes,if you follow the instructions it disables the "Guest User" form appearing on the login screen ,which that is the question."Guest User" is the small white icon with the 3 persons in the login screen.Wasn't that the question? <comment281713> The root user and the guest user are two completely different accounts <comment281714> Even though enabling the root user *may* disable the guest account as well (I didn't try myself), this is in this case merely a side effect. Enabling the root user has its own issues, I wouldn't recommend to do this only you really need the functionality. <comment281717> I was talking about enabling the root user, i was talking about disabling. <comment281718> *I wasn't talking about enabling the root user, i was talking about disabling. <comment281720> The above argument aside, this is a link-only answer & as such, not really great for the SE format... <comment318715> delete the account?
