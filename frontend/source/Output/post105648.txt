Windows draggable under menu bar after second display <body> Using OSX 10.8.5, I recently attached a second display to my 2013 Mac Air via the Thunderbolt port. Since removing this display I can now drag Finder and other windows under the menu bar. They pop back into viewable space on release, but this is visually annoying. How do I get the standard 'solid' menu bar behaviour back?  I have tried switching resolution but this doesn't work.  <answer105659> Possible fix: edit the icon shortcuts in menu bar top right. For example codeSys Prefs &gt; Date &amp; Time &gt; Show date in menu bar/code (toggle it on/off). This seems to force the menu bar to refresh and fix the problem.
