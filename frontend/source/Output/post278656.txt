How can airplane mode interfere with WiFi? <body> I am in a hostel for the second night.  WiFi worked great yesterday.  Today, it asks for the password instead of remembering, but doesn't accept it.  Keeps asking.  I have airplane mode on to prevent cell usage but WiFi and Bluetooth on.    So I turned off airplane mode and the WiFi immediately connected without asking for password.  (However, it later disappeared.)  <answer278748> Airplane mode turns WiFi off  From the Apple Support article     When Airplane Mode is on, you'll see [an airplane icon] in the status bar of your screen or on your watch face. In Airplane Mode, these wireless features are turned off: Cellular (voice and data) Wi-Fi Bluetooth   <comment350835> but you can turn it back on, which it seems like the questioner did "airplane mode on... but WiFi... on" <comment350841> Seems like an issue with the access point more than airplane mode. The airplane mode prompts are there because your Wi-Fi isn't connected and it's thus reminding you that you can disable airplane mode in order to use the mobile network. <comment350940> But how can the AP "know" that I have the cell disabled?  I've had poor performance at many places but this was the first time it seemed to forget the password with cell off. <comment351181> Yes. the statement is not perfectly accurate.  I would have said, "Enabling airplane ,ode turns off all radiosâ€”cell, WiFi, bluetooth, and GPS.  WiFi and Bluetooth can be turned on separately without leaving Airplane mode.  GPS is turned on when WiFi is turned on."
