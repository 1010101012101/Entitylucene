Global hotkey that send keystroke to another app <body> I want to configure a global hotkey like F5, and when I press F5 it should send [Command]+[Option]+[Control]+[Up Arrow] to the Skype app.  Anyone knows an app that I can do this, or script.  <answer227261> Write an AppleScript to do what you want.  Then:  Configure it as a Service using Automator, and assign a keyboard shortcut to it via the Keyboard System Prefs.  strongOr/strong  Get a copy of FastScripts and assign the keyboard shortcut using that.  <answer227277> BetterTouchTool can do this. So can Keyboard Maestro but that would really be overkill.   <comment278870> +1 It is possible with Better Touch, fairly simple to do actually. Did not tried  Keyboard maestro tho.
