How can I get the tags section on Finder sidebar on OS X 10.8.5? <body> Yesterday I reinstalled Snow Leopard because Yosemite is too heavy for my MacBook. How can I get the tags section on the Finder sidebar on OS X 10.8.5 like Mavericks or Yosemite?  <answer174827> Finder tags were introduced in Mavericks (10.9).br They're not available in earlier versions of OS X.  <comment205953> Snow Leopard is 10.6. 10.8.5 is Mountain Lion. What version of OS X are you using exactly? (@Buscar Neither of these OSes support Finder tags) <comment206133> thank you for your answer, my mac os version is 10.8.5 :) <comment206135> but its not possible to add or tweak it?
