Run my Mac command “chsh -s /usr/local/bin/false” and can't log in to my account again <body> I really messed up! Since I ran my Mac with the command below  precodechsh -s /usr/local/bin/false /code/pre  Several minutes later, I noticed my Mac logged out by itself. So, I tried to log back in by clicking 'change user' But I can't see my administer account there.  I guess 'false' is not a loggin-able shell, that's why my account is hidden.  I'm trying to change my shell with Terminal.app on recovery mode or single-user-mode (but both are read-only).  So right now, I want to know if there's any solutions that might be able to fix this problem.  <answer294589> OK - bummer situation, but probably pretty easy to get around.  ol liBoot in single user mode, mount the drive as read&amp;write and remove the code/var/db/.AppleSetupDone/code file and make a new admin account/li liUse that admin account to change back the shell for your user./li liLog out and check your account./li liClean up the “temporary” admin account if you wish./li /ol  Nothing can go wrong, except for perhaps FileVault or no backup or a firmware password so if you can finish a backup or might have another admin account already - using that would be much better in case the above outline isn’t workable for you.  iMac is stuck in a login loop  https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202860  <comment371821> Could you mount your disc on another mac and edit it that way? <comment371824> There might be a better way to safely `chsh` in single user mode, but I know this will work and haven’t tested the alternative. I’ll vote for a good answer that has a better option or feel free to edit mine to make it better if you know the steps are safe. <comment371898> Your comment becomes a hint and I come up with a simple idea, recover my Mac from TimeMachine. Thanks a lot! <comment371899> I couldn't remove that file from single-user-mode or recovery-mode because they are read only mode. (Perhaps I have a shallow understanding of the system.) However, I think that's right. If I can make admin account I can run any command as an administer and fix this situation. I don't want to give up to fix with the way for a better understanding of BSD, but I also need to recovery asap, I'm recovering from TimeMachine backup. Thanks a lot! <comment371901> For next time @yumenosuke `/sbin/mount -uw /` _it should be printed in the instructions a line or two before the prompt gets shown_ <comment371932> oh, that's a good idea! I'll try next time! (I hope no next time...) Thanks! <comment371993> Please add your system version. BTW I can't comprehend this error: `chsh -s /usr/local/bin/false` doesn't do anything bad in my Sierra VM - user bash is still /bin/bash and reboot/login is possible...
