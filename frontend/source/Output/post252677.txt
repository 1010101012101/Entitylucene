My Instagram tags aren't cooperating <body> I am a cosmologist trying to build my Instagram following. I've always been able to tag my hair photos to matrix (since I use their color), cosmoprof (who is having a fall color competition), etc. but as of lately the last three or four pictures I've tried to tag will just vanish. I've never had an issue with this before in my pictures so I'm not sure if it's because I'm posting more recently or what. Please send help. My Instagram name is hairssarah . Please let me know how to fix this! I've contacted Instagram and have heard nothing so far and that was a few days ago. My email youuuuknow@yahoo.com if needed thank you, Sarah   <comment314414> Not that I've any objection to a serious scientist having a hobby... but what possible connection is there between cosmology - the study of the stars, history, the big bang theory etc - and hair colouring?
