Win 7 size within VMWare <body> I use VMWare with a Win 7 virtual machine.  I have a late 2012 iMac with 20GB of RAM. I use Windows for ...  ul lirunning Groupwise constantly/li liusing Respondus occasionally/li liExplorer (please don't judge--I have to test Blackboard LMS occasionally)   :-)/li /ul  What is the appropriate size for it to run in?  <answer95210> I'd go with VMWare fusion's defaults for Windows 7:  ul li60 GB drive/li li1 GB RAM/li /ul  Unless the memory on the guest OS becomes very constrained, you might only need to bump it to 2 GB to get a little speed up if needed. The 2012 iMac CPU is quite capable and you do have significant amounts of RAM so you could juice the VM to a lot more RAM if needed without starving OS X for memory.  <comment111659> Since VMWare can add disk and RAM space on the fly, why not start with as small as can run and only give the VM more when you need it?
