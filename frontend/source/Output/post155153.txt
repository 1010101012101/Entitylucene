How do you start and stop the Spotlight server in Yosemite? <body> There are many forums answering this question for previous versions of MAC OSX, but 10.10 doesn't seem to have the service 'codecom.apple.metadata.mds.plist/code' in code/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/code. It has 3 others (codecom.apple.metadata.mds.index.plist/code, codecom.apple.metadata.mds.scan.plist/code and codecom.apple.metadata.mds.spindump.plist/code).  When I try any mdutil commands I get:  precode-07 08:55:25.673 mdutil[2360:239343] Metadata.framework [Error]: mdsCopyStorePaths failed: (268435459) (ipc/send) invalid destination port Spotlight server is disabled. /code/pre  <answer155157> I'm on 10.10, and I have this service.  precode$ ls -l /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.metadata* -rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel   1.6K Jul 30 01:33 com.apple.metadata.mds.index.plist -rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel   1.6K Jul 30 01:33 com.apple.metadata.mds.plist -rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel   922B Jul 30 01:33 com.apple.metadata.mds.scan.plist -rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel   856B Jul 30 01:33 com.apple.metadata.mds.spindump.plist /code/pre  The you can load/unload with this command:  precodesudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.metadata.mds.plist /code/pre  <answer155390> Clearly I seemed to have lost the com.apple.metadata.mds.plist file from /System/Library/LaunchDaemons. I have replaced it with one from another machine and loaded it with codesudo launchctl load -w com.apple.metadata.mds.plist/code and now everything to do with spotlight is working!  <comment182638> According to the error message, Spotlight is disabled. How did you disable it? Undo that and I would assume `mdutil` would resume functioning. <comment182798> It was disabled before upgrading to yosemite - the command to re-enable it must have changed <comment182799> Interesting - I don't have the com.apple.metadata.mds.plist there - hmm... <comment182802> I recovered the file from a mac running 10.9 and it all works now - but I would be intrigued to see the contents of a 10.10 version. There isn't much in there... <comment182972> Check out [here](http://pastebin.com/NaViMf4Y).
