An app for looking at sound levels for surround sound channels? <body> I have been creating 5.1 surround sound files from Apple Compressor, but need a way to visually see that the different channels are all working properly in the final file. I can't test with a physical surround sound speaker set-up.   Is there an app that can show the sound levels for each channel, like you can with mono/stereo files in Audacity?  I don't have access to a full video editor like Final Cut Pro, or Avid. I would happily pay for a smaller audio utility that lets you do this.  <answer289025> Try codeSoundtrack Pro/code from codeFinal Cut Studio 2009/code. This is simple and robust application. There's surround 5.1 under its hood and moderate set of audio professional tools.  <comment359660> I don't use Audacity, but a quick Google tells me it can do 5.1 <comment359748> See [this post](http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/a/2181/88313) for important guidelines that should be followed when asking for a hardware/software recommendation. It will help everyone by preventing unnecessary answers for items that don't fit your request. <comment369609> Thank you Tetsujin, you are indeed correct. <comment369610> Thank you Andy,  that's a great tip. As Tetsujin mentioned above,  Audacity can also do it, although not as well as the older Sountrack Pro.
