Best way to make an iPhone only receive or make phone calls <body> I tried Guided Access but, once the battery was gone, it booted back up in regular mode.  I think there is a developer tool to put your phone in emkiosk mode/em, but first I'm hoping there might be a simple app out that does that?  <comment364094> You might want to look into the [jamf NOW](https://www.jamf.com/products/jamf-now/)  free MDM software to give you better control of the iPhone. You might possibly be able to set the iPhone to use the Phone app, and nothing but the Phone app. An easier solution would be to _not_use a smartphone at all. <comment364200> thanks for that
