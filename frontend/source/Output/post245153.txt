Network folder in finder sidebar disappears <body> I have added a couple of network folders to the OS X finder sidebar as a shortcut. This is working great as long as I don't shutdown or restart the system. Once the system has been restarted they are no longer visible in finder sidebar. I have also added a Automator script that auto mounts my afp network drive on startup.  Why do network folders disappear? What can do. I really appreciate your help.  <answer245203> Drag the folder from the share to your desktop (Hold CMD and Alt). Then add that alias to the sidebar  <answer277040> I kept losing folders on an SMB share that I'd dragged to the Finder Favorites. They would stay for a day or two, then vanish. None of the solutions I found online seemed to help (reboot,   I found a way to make them stay there: Make a symbolic link (with contextual menu) to the folder on the SMB share you want a link to. Drag the symbolic link to your desktop. Drag the symbolic link to Finder Favorites. [Mac OS Sierra (10.12.3), MacPro6,1]  <comment302234> Is it an alias, or the network volume itself? If its a network volume. It will disappear when it disconnects. An alias is just a link to the share. That should not disappear. <comment302237> It's a folder from a network volume which I dragged to the OS X sidebar. <comment302239> Drag the folder from the share to your desktop (Hold CMD and Alt). Then add that alias to the sidebar <comment302240> Fantastic! It's working as described. I have restarted 5x times and the the folder remains in the OS X Sidebar. If you could post that as answer, I will handover the bounty to you. <comment302241> Fantastic, Thank you! <comment348734> Why resurrect a question with an accepted answer just to post the same answer again? <comment358873> Symlinks and aliases are different things. Currently (macOS 10.12.5) aliases cannot be used in Finder sidebar but symlinks can.
