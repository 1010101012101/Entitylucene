Is it possible to have per-app network/vpn/proxy settings <body> I have a few different applications on my Mac that ideally I would like to run with different network settings.  One app for work I need to run over my work VPN, but at the same time, I have another app I need to run over a proxy for testing. Currently, I can only work with one app at a time with the required network setup. Stop working with it, then setup my other network config.  Is there an app, or a way to specify via settings that an application should use a particular networking setup?  <answer67266> There are two premium (paid) solutions that do this well.  ul liMacProxy ($30USD)  /li liProxifier ($40USD) /li liTSocks is an open source solution, requires some command-line foo./li /ul
