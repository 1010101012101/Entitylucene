Cascade Software Update Servers in Mavericks Server SSL <body> I have 2 OS X servers and I want to mirror the software updates from one server to the other.  I've changed metaiIndexURL settings on the second server, but it seems to have a problem with the self sign certificate.  The logs :  Jun 12 10:36:38 my server swupd_syncd[68212] : Download for "index-leopard-snowleopard.merged-1.sucatalog.download" failed (reason: The certificate for this server is invalid. You might be connecting to a server that is pretending to be \u201c server\u201d which could put your confidential information at risk.)  un 12 10:36:38 opendir3.algodata.intra swupd_syncd[68212] : Download for "index-leopard-snowleopard.merged-1.sucatalog.download" failed (reason: The operation couldn\u2019t be completed. (NSURLErrorDomain error -1100.))
