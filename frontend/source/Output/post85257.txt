"this Emacs binary lacks sound support" <body> I'm trying to get Aquamacs Emacs to play a sound.   I have this:  precode(add-hook 'org-after-todo-state-change-hook 'my-org-after-todo) (defun my-org-after-todo () (play-sound-file "~/Library/Sounds/InkSoundStroke3.aif")) /code/pre  But I get this error:  precodeThis Emacs binary lacks sound support /code/pre  Any ideas?   <answer85405> I had the same problem in 2011 and fixed it with a little elisp package which I am now sharing in https://github.com/leoliu/play-sound-osx. Let me know if it works for you since I can't remember using it much :(  <comment266407> That recipe didn't work for me -- the `require` failed with `(file-error "Cannot open load file" "No such file or directory" "play-sound")`.  But I found a workaround: `(shell-command "afplay whatever.wav")`.
