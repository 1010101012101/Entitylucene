El Capitan SIP and CPAN <body> As we know, Apple introduced it's new "rootless" feature in El Capitan that greatly restricts what the root user is capable of doing.  Unfortunately this feature breaks CPAN for Perl users.  One can install new CPAN modules but you cannot install a new version of CPAN — because that goes into code/usr/bin//code.  I know I can disable SIP but I'd prefer to work with it for a while.  Anyone know a solution to the CPAN problem?  <answer217553> You can install a newer version of codecpan/code in code/usr/local/bin/code with the following CPAN configuration:  precodecpan cpan&gt; o conf makepl_arg "INSTALLBIN=/usr/local/bin INSTALLSCRIPT=/usr/local/bin" cpan&gt; o conf commit cpan&gt; exit sudo cpan -i CPAN /code/pre  This solution, and others, is discussed at perlmonks.  <comment253639> If you're not willing to, temporarily, disable SIP then install to `/usr/local/bin` as that's not protected by SIP. <comment262960> Consider isolating `perl` and your CPAN modules from Apple with [perlbrew](http://perlbrew.pl) – see http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/198575/how-best-to-isolate-my-development-environment-on-os-x/198620#198620
