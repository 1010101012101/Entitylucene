iMessage shows the wrong name for a phone number <body> My iPhone 4 with iOS 6 is playing up in iMessage.  For one person, it is showing their Facebook name (a pseudonym) instead of the name I entered in the contact list (their actual name.)  Additionally, when I type their name, it displays their home phone number as an option which is not stored anywhere in my phone anymore.  For example, say I type strongJohn/strong into the strongTo:/strong field.  It offers:     strongThat Guy John/strongbr   mobile +61 4xx xxx xxx      strongJohn Smith/strongbr   home 03 xxx xxxx   They're the same person on the same linked contact card.  I want it to use the name strongJohn Smith/strong, but if I choose strongmobile/strong, it uses strongThat Guy John/strong.  Additionally, I've previously deleted the stronghome/strong number from my phone, and it's not stored on Facebook, so I don't know how it's getting it.  Is there a caching issue?  How can I make iMessage display the correct contact names and phone numbers?  <comment112809> Do you sync your Facebook contacts into the Contacts app? <comment112810> I do, and I've gone through and linked and normalised my Facebook and Hotmail contacts so there's one unified entry for each person, with their proper name. <comment112811> I found another contact with mismatched names and it too uses the Facebook name over the Unified name.  Maybe it's just a quirk of iMessage?  All the same, I'm a bit concerned about it caching deleted phone numbers.
