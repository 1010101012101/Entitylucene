OSX Firewall: Forwarding Ports & Ignoring Non-Local Requests <body> On my production Debian server I use this to forward requests that come in to port 80 to a non-root process running on port 8080:  precodesudo iptables -A PREROUTING -t nat -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8080 /code/pre  (The process is a Node.js cluster, but I doubt that it's relevant to this question.)  I develop on my Mac and am trying to build a more elegant environment for myself emwithout adding any unnecessary software to my computer/em. I added an entry to my code/private/etc/hosts/code file so I can use a pretty local domain:  precode127.0.0.1 myapp.dev /code/pre  Now I want to access it without specifying a port. In other words, rather than codehttp://myapp.dev:8080/code, I would prefer codehttp://myapp.dev/code. I would also prefer not running my web server directly on port 80 so that it does not have root privileges.  I know my computer comes with a firewall, but I have not been able to find much information about it. So I'm looking for a strongsimple/strong way to forward anything coming to port 80 off to port 8080 like the IP Tables solution on Debian. I would most prefer to use the firewall that came with my computer and to set this up in the simplest way possible.  Can anyone tell me how to do this?  emstrongBonus Points/em/strong: Is there a simple way to ignore all requests coming to port 80 (and 8080 for that matter) except those from my own computer on which the web server is running?  <answer111983> One solution, using IPFW, which co-exists with PF as of OS X 10.9 (Mavericks) is to simply run the command:  precodesudo ipfw add 100 fwd 127.0.0.1,8080 tcp from any to me 80 /code/pre  <comment131557> Mac OS X once utilized a utility called ipfw, but it was deprecated in favor of a port of BSD's pf. The documentation from Apple is available at https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man8/pfctl.8.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/8/pfctl <comment131560> @Dave Thanks for the tip. <comment131561> There are GUI tools that might help. For IPFW there is http://www.hanynet.com/waterroof and for PF there is http://www.hanynet.com/icefloor . I'm trying to get by without installing these as I'll probably never use them again.
