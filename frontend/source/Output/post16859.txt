Why is this dialog being displayed when I start firefox? <body> I'm a beginner Mac OS user.  When I open Firefox I receive the dialog below, why doesn't Firefox just start? What is the point of the below dialog?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8Mn3i.png" alt="Firefox"  <answer16860> This isn't a dialog, this is the result of mounting (opening) the Firefox.dmg (think of it as an archive or drive image). For mac users it's obvious - you should drag the FF icon to the Applications folder shortcut (the blue folder). This will copy the Firefox application in the /Applications/ folder. Then just unmount (eject) the Firefox.dmg archive and start Firefox from Applications (like you start the rest of your applications).  <answer16868> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/X1dIO.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  The file what you downloaded, is an "DMG" archive type (like ISO image).  ul liWhen you double click on it, you open it (called mounted it)./li liAfter opening the archive you should install the application - simple way - drag and drop into the destination./li liAfter the install - eject and usually can trash the dmg archive./li /ul  <comment18403> â€¦and you can delete the Firefox.dmg (drag it to the trash) after that. :)
