What is the name of Network Setup Assistant's window? <body> This is a somewhat common interface, and is generally used to move a user through a series of sequential operations. It can be found in Apple's Network Setup Assistant (System Preferences  Network  Assist Me  Assistance), in many third party .pkg installers, and in applications like VirtualBox.   It has a Low Opacity (light) image as a background, with a translucent Text Field on it, with a visually distinct bottom row with the next and previous buttons.  Here is an example:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DDggT.png" alt=""  <answer275837> These kind of windows are commonly called wizards, or specifically in the context of macOS, a term you already mentioned: emsetup assistants/em. That term actually describes the entire sequence, so you might want to call a single screen a emwizard screen/em, emwizard step/em or emwizard dialog/em instead.  The transparent background image is something specific to macOS; most Windows installer screens show images as well but there, they're confined to either a column on the left or a row on top of the screen.  <comment347064> You're a wizard, Network-setup-assistant.
