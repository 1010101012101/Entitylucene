How to rename files by moving/shifting characters in file name (e.g. appended sequence to prepended sequence)? <body> I've searched high and low, but haven't come up with a viable solution. I want to enable sorting of these files by the sequence number in the file name, however the sequence is appended to the file name. If it was prepended I could accomplish my goal.   Currently files in finder appear as:  ul lithis is a great story_100.mp4/li lianother great story of another time_103.mp4/li liyet another fantastic story_101.mp4/li liour last story_102.mp4/li /ul  Trying to get to:   ul li100_this is a great story.mp4/li li101_yet another fantastic story.mp4/li li102_our last story.mp4/li li103_another great story of another time.mp4/li /ul  How can I accomplish this on a Mac? I've tried applications Renamer and NameChanger, the latter which supports regex, but I'm stuck. Lord this is frustrating...please help and many thanks to you in advance for the dear soul to lend the solution!   <answer262035> I'm not familiar with either of the programs you've tried, but here's how to do it in A Better Finder Rename ($20), and I expect at least one of yours can do it in a very similar manner. See below the screenshot for instructions and an explanation.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fcKJD.png" alt="screenshot"  First, I chose ABFR's "Re-arrange using regular expressions" feature. This will probably be named something similar in other programs. This requires a regular expression to match with, followed by a substitution pattern to create the new filename.  precode(.*)_(\d{3})\.mp4 /code/pre  ul liThe first capture group code(.*)/code simply matches any number code*/code of any character code./code necessary to make the filename match./li liThis is followed by a literal underscore, which in your case delimits the border between the filename and number./li liThen, the second capture group code(\d{3})/code matches exactly three code{3}/code digits code\d/code. If some of the files have more or fewer than three digits, say a number between emn/em and emx/em, you would change it to code(\d{n,x})/code./li liFinally, the extension is matched with an escaped period code\./code and codemp4/code. If your files have different extensions, you should change this to code\.(\w{3})/code â€” just like the number, but with characters code\w/code instead of digits./li /ul  Then, we use those capture groups to make the new filename. The syntax for this part may vary more between programs.  precode$2_$1.mp4 /code/pre  This is perhaps more straightforward: our second set of parentheses surrounded the number, so we put that first with code$2/code, followed by an underscore, the filename code$1/code, and the extension code.mp4/code. (If you used code\.(\w{3})/code earlier, write code$2_$1.$3/code instead.)  If you'd like practice and help with writing regular expressions, I recommend the website RegExr, which provides live syntax highlighting and tooltips.
