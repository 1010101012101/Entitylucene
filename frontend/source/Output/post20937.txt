Using Launchpad with folders <body> Prior to Lion I used overflow as a program launcher.  I'm trying to replace that with Launchpad (one less app to deal with) and it seems to be working...almost.  Is there any way I can add an icon in Launchpad that opens a folder or a specific file (pdf for example)?  I've got all my application icons in place, I'm just trying to get the last few shortcuts from overflow into Launchpad.  <answer20982> Yeah, I got a little trick that will do that, with Automator. Launch Automator and create an an Application workflow. Add the following actions: "Get Specified Finder Items" - here's where you specify the folder you want opened. "Open Finder Items"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aLWNU.png" alt="enter image description here"  Then save the workflow and drag it to Launchpad. You might wanna change the icon too. Works just like a folder.  <comment22956> To my dismay - some PDF that were bundled with Microsoft Office seem to show up in Launchbar as an app - finder even shows them as app - so apparently it's possible even though I really like the distinction between apps and docs to remain far apart. Maybe someone can tear those files apart and get you a wrapper for the files you want launch able? <comment22961> Odd, I installed Office 2011 and didn't get any of that - I did do a custom install so maybe I missed that as a part of my install...? <comment22964> /Applicaions/Microsoft Expression Media/Expression Media.app is one offender. :-( <comment23002> It seems like a lot of extra work but that did the trick for me for both Folders and for files (pdfs, etc)
