Using Windows on Mac keyboard without Delete key <body> I'm just curious - I guess lots of people with Mac hardware use Windows.  How do they manage to do so, given that kbddelete/kbd key is missing on Mac keyboard and you have to press kbdctrl/kbd+kbdalt/kbd+kbddelete/kbd to log in to Windows?  Are they all forced to use autologin (to bypass kbdctrl/kbd+kbdalt/kbd+kbddelete/kbd pressing) or buy a PC keyboard?  <answer23482> When you press the Fn key, the backspace key (Mis-labeled "Delete") on a mac keyboard functions as the delete key.  Therefore, to log onto a windows install which requires kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdAlt/kbd+kbdDelete/kbd, you would press kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdAlt/kbd+kbdFn/kbd+kbdBackspace("Delete")/kbd.  It's worth noting that this works even on the full wired keyboard, with a separate delete key.   <comment26211> Thanks! I thought that there *should* be the way :) <comment26220> +1 for "mis-labeled 'delete'" :)
