How do I get TimeMachine to backup a FUSE filesystem? <body> I have -  precode/Users/me/Documents/ /Users/me/Documents/ADocument ... /Users/me/Fuse4XFileSystem/ /Users/me/Fuse4XFileSystem/AnotherDocument ... /code/pre  TimeMachine will happily backup code/Users/me/Documents/code and everything beneath it. code/Users/me/Fuse4XFileSystem//code can be opened and navigated from the Finder or Terminal. TimeMachine however ignores code/Users/me/Fuse4XFileSystem//code when creating a backup.  How do I get TimeMachine to backup code/Users/me/Fuse4XFileSystem/code ?  <comment103456> Have you tried mounting the FUSE filesystem to `/Volumes/Fuse4XFileSystem` and symlinking it to `/Users/me/Fuse4XFileSystem`? I had a similar issue with an external hard drive that I mounted directly to `/Users/Shared/Music` and didn't get backed up. Time Machine ignored it until I mounted it to `/Volumes/HDD`.
