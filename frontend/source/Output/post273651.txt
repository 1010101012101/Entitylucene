On iPhone 6+ my text message shows my husbands name as sender, not mine <body> How do I have my name show as text message sender? I have tried Settings, messages but have not found the place to change it.   <answer273654> The recipient has an address book entry of your number and/or email address with your husband's name. The easiest way to fix this is to send them your address book card - share it from the contacts app.
