New Pages Documents Don't Retain Bullets Lists Saved in Former Pages Documents--Why? <body> I have Yosemite 10.10.2, Pages 5.5.2.  Earlier today, I created a custom bullets list in a Pages document, saved it as "Note Taking (Custom)," and created an fn-F5 shortcut for it.   When I create a New Pages document, there is no history of the saved bullets list I mention above. Does anyone know a better way of getting around this, other than something janky like copy-pasting the content from an old Pages file into the new one and re-saving my custom bullets list every time I create a New Pages document?  <comment205650> @Famous Blue Raincoat - thanks for the edit suggestion. I was unfamiliar with the context I was posting in and should have been more conservative and professional.
