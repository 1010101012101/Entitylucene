Ability to view WIFI connection details? <body> I've recently entered the mac world by getting my very first macbook pro and now am living with the differences of "thinking differently".  One thing I can't seem to find is any details on my connection.  Is there a way to see if the wifi I am connected to is B/G/N etc; Or does this require some custom app?  It is hard not having 'advanced options' ;)  <answer114521> Hold emAlt/em when clicking at the emAirPort icon/em on the menu bar. It should say codePHY Mode: 802.11.x/code, where x is the type of connection.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gRi0i.png" width="300"  You can also launch Wireless Diagnostics from that menu to capture packets and graph signal and noise measurements.   <comment134215> Hmm wonder what else this magical ALT button does <comment134234> well in finder, if you click the "go" menu while holding control/alt it will allow you to go to Library
