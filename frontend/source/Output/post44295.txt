Keyboard shortcut for "Show Package Contents" <body> I know you can use kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbdO/kbd to open a folder, however when you do that on an application it opens the application.  Is it possible to either make kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbdO/kbd always show the contents or is there another shortcut for that?  <answer44299> I suggest that you create a custom Finder shortcut in strongSystem Preferences → Keyboard → Shortcuts → App Shortcuts → kbd+/kbd/strong.  This way you can open packages with kbd&#x2325;/kbd as a modifier key.  ul likbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbdO/kbd to open folders/li likbd&#x2325;/kbd+kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbdO/kbd to open packages/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DG6Lk.png" alt="screenshot"  <answer44312> If you want a single keystroke to open regular items and regular folders, but show package contents for packages (including Applications), you can turn to Automator.  Create a new strongService/strong in Automator.  The service receives strongfiles or folders/strong in strongFinder.app/strong.  The first action is strongRun AppleScript/strong. Here is the script:  precodeon run {input, parameters}     set my_output to {}     repeat with oneItem in input         if package folder of (info for oneItem as alias) then             try                 tell application "Finder" to open folder ((oneItem as text) &amp; "Contents")             end try         else             set my_output to my_output &amp; oneItem         end if     end repeat     if ((count my_output) is 0) then         error number -128     end if     return my_output end run /code/pre  The second action is strongOpen Finder Items/strong  Save your service. I called mine codeBetterOpen/code.  Then, go to strongSystem Preferences/strong » strongKeyboard/strong » strongKeyboard Shortcuts/strong » strongServices/strong and assign a keystroke to the service. Unfortunately, I have not found a way to reclaim shortcuts already claimed by the Finder, so you may have to pick a keystroke other than kbd⌘/kbdkbdO/kbd.  If you want to open the package in the same window, replace the line  precode tell application "Finder" to open folder ((oneItem as text) &amp; "Contents") /code/pre  with  precode tell application "Finder" to set target of window 1 to ((oneItem as text) &amp; "Contents") /code/pre  <answer122684> Under snow leopard, I found the simplest way was to use SAVE A COPY as iwork 08. then right click to and the show package content option will be available.   <comment50355> Another Wow!, this is possibly the single smallest/tiny-but-awesome reasons why OSX  windows (most of the time anyway) <comment120054> Then it is OSX ≥ Windows, no? ;P (I couldn't help it…) <comment120055> Sorry for double comments, but this solution isn't working for me. (OS X 10.8) I think that this solution only works if it can be found in the menu. <comment131307> (On OS X Lion 10.8.5) I do not have the "Show Package Contents" item menu in my Finder's Finder menu. I could add one shortcut after adding the action item in the toolbar. So right-click on the toolbar, select "Customize toolbar...", add the "action" item to the toolbar, then System Preferences - Keyboard - Keyboard shortcuts to assign the keyboard shortcut you want. HTH <comment143212> This does no answer the users question. They want to show package contents using a keyboard command, not using iWork '08. That relies on proprietary software that is now 5 years old. <comment210807> It works for me. (On Yosemite, I didn't need to do anything other than what's in the original answer )
