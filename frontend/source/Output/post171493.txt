How to install bitmapped *.fon and *.bdf fonts on Lion? <body> I want to install some rare bitmappedsup1/sup fonts on a Lionsup2/sup system.  I have not been able to find these fonts in formats that Font Book will immediately recognize.  I would like to know if there's a way to convert or re-package these fonts in such a way that Font Book will accept.  One of the fonts ("pcsansi") is a single file with extension codefon/code.  The other one ("Terminus") consists of multiple files with extension codebdf/code.  (FWIW, at least one of these fonts, Terminus, is a  font, but for all I know both of them are.)  Is there a way to do what I'm trying to do?  PS: I am particularly keen on installing Terminus.  Of the two fonts, it is the only one for which I was able to find any documentation at all.  (See link above.)  In fact, it comes with a code./configure/code + codemake/code + codemake install/code installation procedure, but the latter step only gzips and relocates a set of *.psf and *.pcf files generated from the *.bdf files during the codemake/code step.  hr  supsup1/sup Yes, I am aware of the fact that not many people like bitmapped fonts.  I still want to install these fonts./supbr/ supsup2/sup This is the latest OS X version that will run on the hardware./sup br/  <answer171503> You may want to try FontLab Studio. My brother used it a few years ago when he needed to design fonts for use on Mac &amp; Windows machines. Website claims it can open .bdf files, but no mention of .fon files.  <comment201762> I'm no real fonts expert, but Fontographer or similar from http://www.fontlab.com might be the thing you need <comment201829> @kjo Can't help you with your question but Terminus.ttf is available [here](http://misc.nybergh.net/pub/fonts/terminus/ttf/)! Only Terminus worked for me though. None of the "Mac-OS-X optimized" faces linked there nore the regular TerminalBold worked for me. <comment201830> @klanomath: +++ Thanks a lot!!!  That's quite a find.  I had the same problem as you did with the OS X-optimized version, but the regular version is nice enough.  To think that this unique gem of a font is on the verge of disappearance boggles the mind.
