How to specify backups destination folder in TimeMachine <body> In TimeMachine settings I can choose only device where to store backups. But I don't want to see backups in the root directory of my external hdd. I have directories like:  - Backups  - Movies  - Music  - Photos  And I want to force TimeMachine store backups in /Backups directory, not in the root of hdd.  <comment257738> Why not have two folders at the root? Backups and other. Then just look at Other when you want to see what you wanted in root? <comment257793> I don't think what you are asking can be implemented!!!
