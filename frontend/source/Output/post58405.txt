Time Machine keeps doing full backups <body> I keep seeing Time Machine doing a full backup of my ~80 GB hard disk. I see this a few times a week, when I first turn on my mac. During the day, I see Time Machine doing small incremental backups of ~100 MB, hourly.  Why does Time Machine does these big backups?  I also see the large backups in the logs here.  precodenanceki@Stephen-Nancekivells-iMac /v/log&gt; bzcat system.log.* | grep backupd | grep Copied | grep GB| sort | less  Jul 23 08:46:32 Stephen-Nancekivells-iMac com.apple.backupd[7569]: Copied 0 bytes of 78.3 GB, 0 of 23051 items Jul 23 08:47:31 Stephen-Nancekivells-iMac com.apple.backupd[7569]: Copied 5324 files (1.1 GB) from volume Macintosh HD.

But this is just a guess.  <answer58433> Time Machine doesn't normally do that. Open Console (under Applications/Utilities), select All Messages in the log list, and type "backupd" into the filter bar. If you scroll back up to the time of one of these full backups, there may be a log message explaining why it backed up so much.  <answer58790> You could try using BackupLoupe to inspect exactly what has been copied in each backup. I find I have to exclude things like my web browser cache to keep the size of the backups down.   <comment67234> I think your guess is wrong. The reason is that all TM backups are in some sense full: Every backup contains the entire directory structure with all the files in it. Files that are unchanged from one backup to the next will be hardlinked together, and even directories which are unchanged (including all files in all subdirectories, recursively) will be hardlinked together. (Normally, you can't hardlink directories, but Apple made an exception for the sake of TM backups.) <comment67238> Can you tell if it actually adds 80GB to the backup disk? Or is it *saying* it needs to back up that much, but in the end only adds much less? <comment67656> How/where do you see the size of what Time Machine is backing up? In other words what is your source? <comment67713> I see the how much its backing up when clicking on the icon on the task bar. <comment67719> Thanks. Thats shown me that some of my excluded files are not being excluded, and keep being backed up. Now to look into why thats happening. <comment69734> by grepping for "GB" aren't you excluding any log lines about smaller backups?
