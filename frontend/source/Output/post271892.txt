How do I get a "Delete" key with an Apple Bluetooth keyboard on Windows? <body> My Macbook died and I had to switch to my emergency backup machine, an Intel NUC running Windows 10.  I can use my Apple bluetooth keyboard all right with it, but I can't get a kbddel/kbd key. Normally this can be achieved by pressing kbdFn/kbd+kbdBackspace/kbd, but that doesn't seem to cut it now. Neither do any other combinations I've seen suggested (Ctrl+Fn+Backspace, Shift+Fn+Backspace, Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Fn+Backspace and combinations thereof).  Also I notice several other keys not working as expected. The kbd&lt; &gt;/kbd key is mapped with kbd^Â°/kbd, for example, and the other way 'round. All the major keys work, though, the keyboard layout in the system matches the layout of the keyboard (German).  How can I fix this?   <comment341741> What keyboard settings do you have in Windows 10? <comment341746> It's the correct layout (German). I found a tool called Keyboard Layout Creator, which is said to come with a "German (Apple)" layout, but it doesn't run on Windows 10 (it needs an old version of .NET that I can't install). <comment341777> Maybe you should try asking this in a forum for Windows?  It doesn't really have anything to do with Apple, there's nothing you can change about a keyboard. <comment341778> @Tom probably the better way to go, yeah...
