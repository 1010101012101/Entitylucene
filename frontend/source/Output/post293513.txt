Spotlight and command-B shortcut quirk <body> When I open Spotlight and type something in, I can search that query using command-B shortcut (i.e. when I type something into Spotlight and press command-B, my search query is sent to the default search engine of the Safari). There is a small quirk however. If Safari app is opened, Spotlight window stays on and I have to close it down manually (two escape keys). However, if Safari app is completely closed, Spotlight window closes automatically.  Here's two screenshots to show visually what I mean:  Spotlight - type "example" in - press command-B (prior to doing this, Safari was completely closed i.e. it was quit).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Q2qbg.png" alt="enter image description here"  Spotlight - type "example" in - press command-B (prior to doing this, Safari was opened)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uxJQA.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  My question is the following - is this the standard behaviour or I have bug/misconfiguration on my Mac? My OS is 10.12.6.  <answer293514> I'm running 10.12.6, too, and it works the same way for me.  If I follow the exact same steps as you described, I get the same results that you get.  I'm assuming this is normal behavior.  <comment370373> Same here as well. Didn't know about the command+B at all, so this is a great addition to the workflow! :) <comment370648> This answers my question but wanted to add a small nuance that clarifies this behaviour: if the focus is not on Safari.app, the Spotlight window will automatically hide. If the focus is on Safari.app, the Spotlight window will remain open despite opening a new tab. Practically speaking, I found so far only one real world example of this - if you close every tab and every window of Safari but the focus will remain on the app (top bar will read "Safari"), Spotlight window will not automatically hide.
