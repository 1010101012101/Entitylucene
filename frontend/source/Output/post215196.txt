It try to disable de USB ports but they can't so they throw this error.  It's hardware related, you can do nothing about.  <comment261076> Technically it is not just the (external) USB-Port but all devices connected to the MBP, f.e. the integrated Facetime Camera. <comment261077> Did you by any chance open up the MBP, f.e. to change the HD or SSD? "Overcurrent" points to a short in the electric connections cased by faulty wires or connections. <comment261245> Only after the issue started - though very possible it could be cause by other "rough" behaviour.
