iTunes playlist name is not the name on the burned CD, but the one from the original playlist <body> First time here. I am using the latest version of iTunes.   ul liI made a compilation of songs./li liI added them under a playlist called 997/li liI burned said playlist to disc. The name of the CD in my car's CD player is 997. (Great up to now.)/li liI created a new empty playlist called George./li liI dragged and dropped songs from 997 into the George playlist./li liI burned the George playlist. The name of the CD in my car's CD player is 997 (Not so great...)/li /ul  Anyone care to explain what I am missing here?
