Have there been any error messages or such? <comment85489> @patrix yes I followed up to selecting the disk, because it wouldn't show my network disk. It did have one error, it failed to copy some files over to my network drive as it says 'the operation timed out' <comment85492> In which of the steps 1-5 were you required to copy the files which failed? <comment85495> 5b is the one i got stuck at <comment85497> Can you edit the question accordingly and include a screenshot (or copy/paste from Terminal) of the command you are trying to run and the result? <comment85503> @patrix its going to take a little while, all it does is say that some files fail because it times out <comment110164> Has there been a follow up on this? I am experiencing the same problem.
