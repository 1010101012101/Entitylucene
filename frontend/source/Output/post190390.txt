"Apps" portion of storage taking up large amounts of space (Yosemite) <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/STVu8.png" alt="As shown in the picture below. The apps are taking 161.5 GB of space even though there is only 42.02 GB of storage used"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/o7PFB.png" alt="After sweeping with OmniDiskSweeper it revealed that only 17.2 GB of storage was used by the Applications folder"  Where is all the disk space going?  <comment226007> @Dempa It's not 'below', the original was correct. You've edited the alt text for the image itself. <comment226011> Thanks. Checked other answer and fixed the problem.
