Windows failed to start after upgrade to El Capitan <body> There is something very frustrating I am trying to figure out for a few days. My MacBook Pro has a 500 GB hard drive. It had Mac OS 10.6.8. There was a Windows7 installation done some time ago via Bootcamp and I was able to switch between it and Mac OS without any problems. Mac OS partition had around 180 GB and the rest was for Windows.  Recently I have upgraded to El Capitan and when I am trying to start Windows ( alt key while loading ) I get this "Windows failed to start. A recent hardware or software change might be the cause" error message. There is also no Windows partition in Disk Utility or BootCamp. Around 300 GB simply gone away.  Is there any way to recover it? I would really appreciate any help because I simply can not afford to lose data on that Windows partition...

You partition table should look similar to this one:  precode... 325312736    1269536      3  GPT part - 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC 326582272       1712         #gap 2 326583984  650189000      4  GPT part - EBD0A0A2-B9E5-4433-87C0-68B6B72699C7 976772984        151         #gap 3         976773135         32         Sec GPT table 976773167          1         Sec GPT header /code/pre  The gaps between partition 3 and 4 (emgap 2/em) and between partition 4 and the second GPT table (emgap 3/em) have variable sizes. I have found a size of ~1000-2000 blocks for emgap 2/em and 100 Â± 50 block for emgap 3/em. Some Boot Camp installations may also contain a second EFI partition after partition 3 (the Recovery HD).  To recover your Windows partition you have to delete partition 4 and restore the old NTFS Windows partition. To find the start block and the size of this partition you may use a partition recovery tool like TestDisk or find the partition manually.  hr  To find your NTFS partition manually you have to install OS X to an external disk or thumb drive. Boot to the external drive, install wxHexEditor and enable the root user. Log-in as root user.  The assumption behind the approach outlined below is that the El Capitan installer either claims that a former second EFI partition (disk0s4 - 204800 blocks) is the "new" Windows 7 NTFS partition and has skipped disk0s5 (the real old Windows NTFS) or has created a random partition.   A standard NTFS partition has two characteristic and almost identical blocks - the first block of a volume and the second last block - containing the string NTFS and BOOTMGR messages. If the two blocks can be identified the start block and the size can be determined. Adding this NTFS volume in the "free" space of disk0 should restore your previous Windows 7 volume.  ol liOpen Terminal and enter (below I assume that the disk identifier of your internal disk is disk0):  precodediskutil list gpt -r show /dev/disk0 fdisk /dev/disk0 /code/pre  to get an overview.

Restoring the old Windows 7 partition should allow you to access your data. It doesn't necessarily mean that it is bootable nor that the second EFI deleted in step 2 is strongnot/strong needed (to boot the restored Windows 7 partition).  strongemThis might fail due to other (random) occurrences of the string NTFS. Please contact me if you are unsure or run into problems./em/strong  <answer237263> Based on your codehexdump/code, I have determined a NTFS partition existed immediately after the last partition shown in your GUID Partition Table (GPT). The codehexdump/code also shows the size of this deleted partition.     The values printed by codehexdump/code are described in the table show in the section titled Partition Boot Sector from the Wikipedia site NTFS.   Using this information, you may be able to recover your lost partition. Below, I have outlined the procedure. Before executing the procedure, you will need to do the following.  ol liDownload and install the Terminal application command codegdisk/code. This command can be downloaded from the site GPT fdisk. If you wish, you can read a tutorial found here./li liDisable System Integrity Protection (SIP). See "How do I disable System Integrity Protection (SIP) AKA ârootlessâ on OS X 10.11, El Capitan?" for instructions. When finished, you can enable SIP./li /ol  The example below shows the procedure to fix your computer. I simulated your Macs conditions using a spare disk image. Therefore, you will need to substitute code/dev/disk0/code where I used code/dev/disk1/code. If you make a mistake, you should be able to enter a kbdcontrol/kbdkbdC/kbd to exit the program. Any actual changes are not written back to your internal disk until the end of the procedure.  precodeSteelhead:~ davidanderson$ sudo gdisk /dev/disk1 Password: GPT fdisk (gdisk) version 1.0.1  Warning: Devices opened with shared lock will not have their partition table automatically reloaded!

These commands will not change your computer. Some may ask for your login password. This is normal. Do you know if Windows 7 was a 32 bit or 64 bit install? Also, what is the model/year of your Mac? <comment289312> @DavidAnderson thank You, I have updated the question <comment289322> The Windows partition has be removed from the partition tables. The space occupied by this partition still exists. To what extent the data may have been corrupted is unknown by me. Because the Mac has a System Reserve partition, recovering the partition location alone with not permit Windows to boot. If you can add the partition back to the GPT, then OS X may be able to read the data. I would first ask @klanomath if he has any thoughts on a NTFS partition recovery. <comment289324> Thank You. It's really sad that an OS X update has caused it. I will patiently wait for @klanomath to notice this question and maybe add something. Regards. <comment289331> Since klanomath has not yet posted to your question, I am not sure an @klanomath will result in a message being sent to him. Anyway he has been gone for the last 2 hours and it is 12:48 AM in Berlin. <comment289346> @klanomath: I installed 64 bit Windows 7 SP1 in VirtualBox using all the default settings. The gap between the "System Reserved" partition and the subsequent NTFS partition was zero blocks. The first block of a NTFS volume is described [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTFS#Partition_Boot_Sector). <comment289347> @DavidAnderson I searched for the gap values here at SE and found varying values. Did you install Windows 7  with the Boot Camp Assistant in Virtual Box? <comment289353> @klanomath: I never have installed OS X in any virtual environment. In this case, it would be pointless to do so. The BootCamp Assistant does not create a "System Reserved" partition when installing Windows in BIOS mode. The user pnb1 either did not use or incorrectly used the BootCamp Assistant to install Windows 7. The "System Reserved" partition was created by the Windows installer because OS X 10.6 does not have a Recovery Partition. Normally the Boot Camp Assistant prevents this from occurring by allocating all the free space before Windows installs. <comment289362> Thank You very much, I will learn more about all this _stuff_ in order to be more comfortable with executing the instructions you have given. Then I will report back. <comment289363> @pnb1 If you document your listings and modifications properly any changes of the gpt/mbr are reversible and won't hurt the content of the volumes. `gpt` and `fdisk`only writes to the first and last 33 blocks of your drive. <comment289364> Some more details: I got this MBP with OS X 10.6.7 and Win7 already installed. I then upgraded it to OS X 10.6.8. It was already then when Win7 was gone from the BootCamp. However, I was still able to run Win7 by restarting MBP, holding _alt_ and selecting Windows partition. <comment289444> I could be wrong, but this is the way I read the instructions: Delete partition 4 in step 2. Find the beginning of partition 4 in step 8. Find the end of partition 4 in step 10. This results in adding back partition 4 in step 12. In the end, nothing changes. <comment289460> @DavidAnderson Nonono ;-). My assumption is that the new disk0s4 is either an efi or a random partition item created by el capitan  (making it a standard NTFS partition) and the real old disk0s4  is sunk somewhere after block 326582272, Searching backwards for the string *NTFS* from the end of disk0 won't get you to the end of the "new" disk0s4. <comment289772> Could you execute the following command and post  the results to your question. This command will not change your computer. The command is `sudo  hexdump  -v  -n  512  -s  326787072b  -C  /dev/disk0` <comment290354> @DavidAnderson I am sorry for delay, I have updated the question with the output of the above command. <comment290396> I have run into another problem. As You said I have install OS X into external thumb drive or disk. Unfortunately my USB ports are not working. I am now waiting for a caddy tray to be delivered in order to attach another drive. <comment290443> @pnb1 If you have a second Mac with FireWire you can use that one by booting the broken one in Target Mode and attaching it to the good one. <comment290514> @klanomath yes, I am aware of that. Unfortunately I don't have another mac. <comment290898> I was following your instructions and noticed a minor difference: Yours is   `First sector (34-978515631, default = 326787072) or {+-}size{KMGTP}: 326787072 Last sector (326787072-`978515631`, default = `978515631`) or {+-}size{KMGTP}: +649984000`  and mine is   `First sector (34-976773134, default = 326787072) or {+-}size{KMGTP}: 326787072 Last sector (326787072-`976773134`, default = `976773134`) or {+-}size{KMGTP}: +649984000 ` Should I continue anyway? <comment290908> @pnb1: To simulate your conditions, I used the Disk Utility application to create a virtual drive (i.e. spare disk image file) to represent your physical drive. It is almost impossible to create a virtual disk exactly the same size as yours, so I created a slightly larger one. This is why the values are different. You should still enter the values shown in the post. Note: the value `+649984000` has to include the `+` (plus sign). <comment290914> It worked! The partition was restored and all the files from Windows are here again. Thank You so much. Also big thanks to @klanomath.I really really appreciate what you guys have done for me. Best of luck :)
