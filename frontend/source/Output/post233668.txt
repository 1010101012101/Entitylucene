pagestuff command error: Can't map file <body> I want to use codepagestuff/code command line tool with my iphone application.  It's working with Mac application but not with iphone application.    used command   precodepagestuff MetalMatrixMultiply.app -a /code/pre  Got error as      Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin/pagestuff:   can't map file: MetalMatrixMultiply.app (Invalid argument)   How to solve this error?  <comment285531> Shouldn't this be run on the executable file not the bundle? So somethink like `MetalMatrixMultiply.app/Payload/MetalMatrixMultiply`. <comment285533> In addition to using the full path to the executable (which is also required for OS X applications): is `pagestuff` even supposed to work with iOS apps? <comment285537> is pagestuff even supposed to work with iOS apps? .... I am not sure about this. if anyone knows please tell me.
