Decrease GPU memory on MacBook Air <body> I own MacBook Air (early 2015) where the GPU and its memory reads as following:  Intel HD Graphics 6000 strong1536 MB/strong  I think that the amount is a bit too high so I would rather decrease it to 1000 MB or something lower so I can benefit from higher RAM for applications.  Is there a possibility to do something like that?  <answer274140> Simple answer: No.  The Integrated GPU in the MBA can allocate up to 1.5 GB of system memory.  There is no way for the user to change this in macOS.  strongIntel HD Graphics/strong  Apple computers using newer versions of Intel HD Graphics as the primary GPU dynamically allocate up to 1.5 GB of system memory.

This is handled at the hardware level - some PC BIOSes allowed you to modify this value, but it's not common anymore and definitely not so with Apple.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zNeyO.png" alt="enter image description here"  So, to "free up" this RAM, you have two choices:  ol liReduce your video resolution and color depth/li liAdd more RAM/li /ol  Since the first is not desireable and the second is impossible, if you absolutely need more memory, it's time to upgrade your MacBook to one with 16GB or more.
