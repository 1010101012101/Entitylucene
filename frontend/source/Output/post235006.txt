Brew doctor complains about 2 unbrewed dylibs (possibly remnants from Samsung Sidesync) <body> I've just found that brew doctor gives me the following error :  precodePlease note that these warnings are just used to help the Homebrew maintainers with debugging if you file an issue. If everything you use Homebrew for is working fine: please don't worry and just ignore them. Thanks!  Warning: Unbrewed dylibs were found in /usr/local/lib. If you didn't put them there on purpose they could cause problems when building Homebrew formulae, and may need to be deleted.  Unexpected dylibs:     /usr/local/lib/LibSideSyncOSX9.dylib     /usr/local/lib/ss_conn_lib.dylib /code/pre  I am suspected that these are remnants of Samsung Sidesync program that I tried to use recently but it never worked, so I uninstalled it (using iTrash). Should I manually remove those two libraries or not(one of them is 1.7mb)? Thank you.  <answer235007> Yes you should remove them. Package managers will complain if there are files installed in the area they manage. So with Homebrew only Homebrew installed files should be in /usr/local  In this case I would guess from the names the first is definitely from Sidesync but the second could also be used by others  <comment287386> These two files have the same creation date (Oct-12-2015) so they probably belong to the same program.
