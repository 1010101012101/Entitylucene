Remap command-arrow key to the same as ctrl-arrow keys (moving by word) <body> I would like to be able to use Command arrow keys to navigate by word like you can with Ctrl. I've disabled the Mission Control mappings already. What's the easiest way to remap?  <answer73127> You can change the default keybindings for OS X text editing with the DefaultKeyBinding.dict file. Make a new text file at code~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict/code, with these contents:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;^&amp;#xF702;&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;moveWordLeft:&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;key&gt;^&amp;#xF703;&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;moveWordRight:&lt;/string&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  Restart or log out and in, and kbdcontrol/kbdkbdleft/kbd and kbdcontrol/kbdkbdright/kbd should do what you're looking for. This will work in emmost/em OS X apps, but there are some (typically third party text editors) that use their own bindings, which will need to be switched on a case-by-case basis.  <comment84891> FYI, you can use option-arrow to move between words. <comment84892> I know. I'd like it to be Command. <comment84907> Shouldn't you use `&#xF702;` instead of `\UF702`? <comment84967> I don't think so. Per [Apple's Developer guide to Key Bindings](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/EventOverview/TextDefaultsBindings/TextDefaultsBindings.html), `^` is the proper character for the control modifier, and the [NSEvents docs](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSEvent_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000016-SW136), left and right are unicode `F702` and `F703`. <comment84971> Oh, my mistake, just did a little more testing and I forgot to account for unicode encodings. Answer updated accordingly.
