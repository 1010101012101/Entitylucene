Dual (DVI) monitor setup for MacBook Pro 15" (Retina mid-2015) <body> I am looking for a solution to connect a MacBook Pro 11,4 (15" retina model from mid 2015) to two monitors. The present question is different from prior questions on dual monitor for Macbook Pro, as it is for a specific model (specific ports) and monitors with specific connections.  Both monitors have VGA and DVI connections, but my MacBook Pro has two ThunderBolt ports and a HDMI port.  <answer261589> You'll want to purchase 2 mini-DisplayPort to DVI cables. Connect the DVI end to the monitor and the mini-DisplayPort into the Thunderbolt ports on the MacBook Pro.  <comment327570> Possible duplicate of [Connect MacBook Pro to two external monitors](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/195215/connect-macbook-pro-to-two-external-monitors) <comment327599> @Allan I disagree on the comment about duplication. I have specified why in my question. <comment327602> Do you know of any docking solutions as an alternative? <comment327603> Yes, there's lot of dock options available from Belkin, Elgato, OWC, etc. Check out a list here: http://www.macworld.com/article/2920233/laptop-accessories/thunderbolt-2-docks-roundup-connecting-multiple-devices-to-your-mac-laptop-has-never-been-easier.html
