Safari won't connect to any server! <body> Chrome &amp; Firefox works fine but when i open Safari it says "Safari can't connect to the server". I have tried to change the DNS and i searched all over google but i couldnt find anything regarding this item.  Can anyone please help me? Even when i watch my webpage on my local server through mamp it says that it cant connect to the server.  <comment110713> Do you have any plugins? <comment110717> yes i do,  Divx Plus Web Player HTML5 is the name of the plugin. <comment110721> Check your proxy settings under System Preferences - Network. <comment110723> I looked to my proxy settings but nothing is checked, this is right or wrong? <comment110731> Soo... How did you post this? <comment110732> through Chrome?.. <comment110821> Try to disable every plugin you have
