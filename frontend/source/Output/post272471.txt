Can't delete Windows partition on Mac <body> I wanted to download windows 8.1 because I need it for some programs for school on my Mac. I used Boot Camp Assistant to make a partition for Windows, but I cant find or switch to windows 8.1. I would like to delete that partition and then restart the whole process, but none of these ways work for me. The Windows partition does not appear in Disk Utility, or when I restart the mMac and hold the option key. My storage has gone down from 250 GB to 201 GB and but the 49 GB seems to be lost which is impossible.  ol liStart up your Mac in OS X./li liQuit all open apps and log out any other users./li liOpen Boot Camp Assistant, then click Continue./li liSelect “Remove Windows 7 or later version,” then click Continue./li /ol  Do one of the following:  ul liIf your Mac has a single internal disk, click Restore./li liIf your Mac has multiple internal disks, select the Windows disk, select “Restore disk to a single OS X partition,” then click Continue./li liIf you installed Windows on a disk that has a single partition  ol liStart up your Mac in OS X./li liOpen Disk Utility, located in the Other folder in Launchpad./li liSelect the Windows disk, click Erase, choose the Mac OS Extended (Journaled)  format, then click the Erase button./li /ol/li /ul  <comment342451> Is this a question, or an answer, or an attempt to be both?
