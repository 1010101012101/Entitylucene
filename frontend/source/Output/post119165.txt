Random Photo Steaming with Apple TV <body> I have my Apple TV set to stream random photos from the Apple TV file, while I listen to music. There are over 1200 photos in this file, but Apple TV seems to pick the same ones over and over regardless of how often the system is used. Is there anything I can do to get a more random selection of photos displayed?  <comment138971> What do you earn "from the Apple TV file"?
