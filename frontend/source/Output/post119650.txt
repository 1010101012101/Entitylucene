Discard email in Outlook 2011 <body> Say I start a new email, and I decide to discard it. If I press kbdAlt+W/kbd, a window prompts me with the following three options shown below:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/x5eZj.png" alt="enter image description here"  Most of the time I want to "Discard Changes", strongbut/strong OS X does not let me use kbdTAB/kbd to change my selection.   I have tried every key combination, but and the only thing that works is using the mouse to click on "Discard Changes".   I  would like to use my keyboard to confirm that yes , I just want to discard my email. Any way to do this?  <answer119652> To do this completely from the keyboard, go to System Preferences → Keyboard → Shortcuts and enable Full Keyboard Access to All Controls, or press ⌃F7.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oAWxD.png" alt="All controls"  You can then ⇥ between the buttons, and space to select.br ↩︎ will always select the default button (in this case, Save).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/By9dA.gif" alt="Tabbing between buttons"
