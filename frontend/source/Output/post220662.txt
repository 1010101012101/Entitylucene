Arranging Windows/Applications via presets <body> Is there any software for OS X that can automatically arrange a workspace according to a preset?  By some sort of shortcut, I would like to launch applications and then place them in a certain way (position, size). It would be great if different arrangements are possible for multiple displays, if they are plugged in.  Budget: Anything from free to $15 USD (preferably free).  <answer233956> I'm not sure if it's the best option out there, but the application Stay offers this functionality, albeit in a limited way.  It's possible to configure default window sizes and positions for applications. Saving a state and restoring the state can be done with keyboard shortcuts.  I would however have liked to see more options and different presets, even combined presets with multiple applications in one layout.
