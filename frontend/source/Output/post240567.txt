Reply to all cc'ed - Mail OSX <body> When I receive an email which has been cc'ed to a few people, is there a way where  I can set the default reply mode to em"reply to all"/em, rather than em"reply to just the sender"/em?   <answer240568> I guess you are using the Mail application by Apple. In this case, you just need to press the "double arrow" button, rather than the "single arrow", to reply to all the senders, as you can see here:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/707Xc.png" alt="enter image description here"  Otherwise, you can use the shortcut kbdShift/kbd+kbdCmd/kbd+kbdR/kbd to perform the same "reply to all" operation.  <comment297361> Thanks, id been using the icon version but sometime i just automaticly click on the reply to sender only, i was wandering if there was a way to make the reply to all the default <comment297376> Have you tried with the shortcut? I think this can be the only way you can always reply to all senders automatically (if you sometimes pick the wrong button).
