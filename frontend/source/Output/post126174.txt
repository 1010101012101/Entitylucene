Corrupted hybrid GPT disk and possible fixes <body> I have a 17" Mac Book Pro (Late 2011) which have dual boot Windows 8.1 installation via Bootcamp along MacOSX. Prior to Mavericks upgrade I had this disk layout  precodeEFI Machintosh (~115 GB) Bootcamp (~630 GB)     Windows (Primary NTFS Partition, ~190 GB) -&gt; C:\ drive in Windows     Other (Extended NTFS Partition, ~440 GB) -&gt; D:\ drive in Windows /code/pre  To accomplish such layout (i.e. overcome 4 partition limitation of Windows), I had to remove MacOS Recovery partition prior to install Windows.  After upgrading Mavericks, I had noticed MacOS repartitioned the disk to create Recovery partition again. As you guess, D: drive is gone (but it's data intact). I tried to remove recovery partition again. But, D: drive was still invisible in Windows. So, I tried TestDisk utility to fix it under Windows 8.1. I could access all files including D: drive's files. After trying to fix by changing D: drive status to "P" (Primary) in TestDisk, Windows is not shown up under boot menu.  When I run Disk Utility under MacOS, my disk layout as follow.  precodeEFI Machintosh (~115 GB) Windows (~190 GB) Other (~440 GB) /code/pre  All partitions can be seen as separate partition (including extended one - Other). I still can access all files. But, this is a development machine and lots of heavy-weight applications should be installed if I choose to repartition whole disk by destroying all data. So, fixing disk layout is a better choice.  If I really had to reinstall everything, I want to make it "future-proof" (or at least more-future-proof). I have Windows 8.1 Enterprise license which is EFI aware. Is that mean if I somehow partition the disk in a way, could I completely have a "future-proof" installation? I mean I need 3 partition at least (Mac, Win, Other), EFI mode enable to upgrade Mac or Windows in future without any such pain (avoiding hybrid GPT, MBR, extended partition etc.)? If so, how?
