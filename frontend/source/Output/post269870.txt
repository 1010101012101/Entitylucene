How to stop iPhone users from unintentionally sending texts to my email address <body> I use an Android phone but many of my friends and family have iPhones.  Starting a few months ago I discovered that several people sent me text messages that didn't go through.  And after digging into the problem, I discovered that their messages appeared as blue on their phone, not green, indicating that iMessage didn't convert it to a standard text. Then I discovered that (at least for some of the people), their texts were being sent to my email, not my phone number.  The weird thing is that I don't even think some of these people had my email.  I do have an iCloud account because I own a Mac, and somebody has indicated that can lead messages to your email address.  But I'm not sure.  How can I, once and for all, deregister emmy email/em (not my phone number, that's already been asked) from receiving iMessages and have my friends' Messages apps only suggest my phone number as a destination to text me at?  strongtl;dr:/strong My email is registered as an iMessage destination, but I need to deregister it so my iPhone-using friends only send SMSs to my phone number.  strongJust to be clear:/strong This post is not a duplicate of asking how to deregister your phone number from iMessage.  I never had an iPhone when iMessage existed and when I try using the deregister iMessage page it just says my phone number is not registered with iMessage.  <comment339071> You'll need to turn off iMessage. Follow Apple's steps here: https://selfsolve.apple.com/deregister-imessage/ <comment339121> I already tried before and it said my phone isn't registered with iMessage.  I just tried again to confirm the same behavior. I did own an iPhone, but I got it approximately 8 years ago (2nd generation ), long before iMessage existed. I switched to Android approximately 6 years ago.  Again, long before iMessage <comment339139> Ok then, try this: on your Mac, go to Messages - Preferences (in the menubar) - Accounts tab - and turn off your email address for "you can be reached at". <comment339147> @owlswipe - thanks for the flag - please edit the post to clarify how this isn't a dupe. Then if you can answer / flag comments for cleanup - super bonus. Thanks all <comment339156> @bmike Edited the post, waiting for OP to respond a second time before posting answer. <comment339163> @owlswipe, I tried followed your instructions, but the checkbox for *I can be reached at my email* is checked, but greyed out so I can't uncheck it.  The only thing I could do was uncheck *enable this account*, but when I did that messages didn't get delivered at all.  My friend tried to send me a message at my email and it didn't redirect to my phone number.  It just sat in the ethosphere until I re-enabled the account. <comment339166> @J-bob Indeed, it should not be delivered if you disable your accountâ€”that's what I hoped what happen. It will also stop recommending your email address to friends trying to text you and just show your phone number. If you want to instead redirect iMessages to your SMS number, make a new question for that and give me a link. <comment339257> @owlswipe Ok, so I disabled the account again and left it that way.  You're saying that the iCloud should now send an update to iPhone users' contact list so my email doesn't appear as an option for sending a message?  Will this be the case for people who have already sent a message to my email?  If so, that's a viable solution.  I'll ask my friend after a day to see her phone update. <comment339266> @J-bob It *should* stop your email from showing up as an option for iMessage on friends' phones who haven't texted you and maybe on friends' phones who have texted you (though that can be buggy sometimes). I'm not positive but I think that's the best option. <comment339287> @owlswipe If you write your previous comment as an answer I'll accept it
