Airdrop doesn't work between MBP mid-2012 and iPhone 6 <body> I read that Airdrop between iOS is since the MBP mid-2012. Although I have that Macbook I can't see my iPhone and viceversa. What can be the problem or the info that I'm misunderstanding?  PS: I have El Capitan but didn't make a clean installation.  Thanks in advance.  <answer213958> Found a post which gives this advice:     Turn off bluetooth on your mac, delete: /Library/Preferences/com.apple.Bluetooth.plist turn bluetooth back on   I tried this and can confirm that it fixed the problem for me.  <comment256819> Do both devices have wifi and Bluetooth turned on? <comment256820> Yes they do. Firewall is turned off btw. <comment256821> Do you have the latest software updates, El Capitan 10.11.1 and iOS 9.1? <comment257008> Yes, they are with the lastest updates
