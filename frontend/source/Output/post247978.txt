Stop Safari iOS closing all open tabs when switching tabs or open a new one <body> With Safari on the ipad (currently iOS 9.3.3 but also prior versions), often I have 5-10 tabs open.  Regularly (ie once a fortnight) when I open a new tab or switch to view a different tab and at that moment, Safari cycles between all open tabs and closes each of them until nothing is open.  I thought it may be a memory error or something, so I've gone to settings and cleared the history/cache, but even 10mins later after doing that, Safari did the same thing again.  I then thought it may be caused by Popup Blocking since that's the only external functionality that can interfept what Safari does. I had 1Blocker installed, so I deleted that off the iPad and turned off Popup Blocking in settings. Unfortunately, again, later that day Safari again did the same thing and closed everything.  Now, it seems like it's just Safari itself.  How do I stop this behavior? I keep losing all open tabs with no way to recall what was open except holding down the code+/code icon that lists only the last 5 recently closed tabs.  Switching to another browser isn't an option given how core Safari is to other apps etc.  <comment354063> This appears to be fixed in iOS 10. I'm not sure if it's all versions of 10 as I'm now using 10.3.1 and just realised I've not had this issue now for quite a while. Currently I have 30+ tabs open with no problem.. and have had 20+ of them open that I haven't referred back to for months.... but at least they're still there and Safari hasn't crashed!
