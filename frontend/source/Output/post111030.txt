Possible to have separate shortcuts for different text-to-speech voices? <body> I know that it is possible to make Mac OS X to read the text with a keyboard shortcut.  System preferences strongemDictation &amp; Speech-Text to Speech/em/strong tab img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vJBkW.png" alt="enter image description here"  But suppose I'm multilingual. Is it possible to have different shortcuts for different languages?  <answer111109> While I couldn't find a way to assign keyboard shortcut directly, an acceptable solution turned out to be much simpler than one might think.  Create a new Service in Automator. By default it takes selected text in any Application and lets you to do something to it. Choose emSpeak Text/em from the emText/em category and select any active voice from the drop-down. Now save the new Service under some descriptive name and you will be able to assign a desired keyboard shortcut to it from: emPreferences  Keyboard  Shortcuts  Services  Text  "Name of the Service"/em.  Done.
