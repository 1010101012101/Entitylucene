Change default left column width calendar.app OS X <body> There is a left column in calendar.app with calendar list in it, but it's a little narrow for me. It's possible to change it's width. But if close it, than close calendar.app, and than open it again, the width will be reset to default.br Is it possible to change the default width of left column?  <comment289180> Sounds like a permissions error. What OS are you on? <comment289343> El capitan with last updates. <comment289736> try the 2 paragraphs on permissions & home folder/ACL fixes from this - http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/232100/85275
