USB device access (EyeTV) on waking <body> I have an old 2006 MacBook Pro I'm using as a simple server in my house. One of its uses is recording over-the-air television using an EyeTV Diversity USB stick.  The MacBook Pro sleeps most of the time, for energy saving purposes, and wakes for certain tasks like NAS access and to record shows.  My issue is that the MacBook Pro wakes for a recording but then believes that there's no channels and makes a em0kb/em recording.  hr  strongMore detail:/strong  ul liThe various EyeTV sticks are notoriously troublesome when wanting to record and let the host Mac sleep. This always boils down to user/account access that needs various permissions when waking from sleep. The thing is, my Mac has no lock screen or password needed. When it turns on or wakes up, it goes straight to the desktop./li liI have EyeTV software running at all times, just not playing a station./li liI believe this may be a USB/sleep issue rather than EyeTV specific as I manually woke the MacBook Pro (using Wake On LAN), connecting using VNC and watched as it went to record a scheduled show. It couldn't. Once I opened a TV channel window to play, manually, it then seemed to know the stick was connected and picked up the recording./li liThe issue seems to be that once my MacBook Pro comes out of sleep, it needs me to manually play any channel before it recognises the device is available for recording from./li liIf it's of relevance, I use No Sleep to enable the MacBook Pro to run with its lid closed. I don't know if this interferes in any way. The laptop still goes to sleep after the set amount of time in the system preferences, and wakes using a Wake On LAN packet. It just ignores the usual command to go to sleep when the lid is closed./li liWaking from sleep to record is a built-in feature of the EyeTV software. As I mentioned, it wakes fine, it just doesn't seem to recognise there's channels available after waking./li liI'm running Snow Leopard 10.6.8 and the stick is nearly as old as the MacBook Pro, so it's not some functionality that is meant for newer macs./li /ul  <comment317515> Please avoid using code tags unless you are posting code. It makes text much more difficult to skim or read. Using acronyms without spelling the full phrase out at least once first makes it more likely that people may misunderstand, or not understand at all, what you are talking about. <comment317679> I find the exact opposite: highlighting relevant peripherals and software phrases in the text makes it far easier to skim read. It was a deliberate aid for doing so. I picked up the habit from others doing the same on the main stackoverflow site where it helped skim through a wall of text and pick out the primary subjects of the question where it was obvious it was not code and bold or italic would be unsuited. However, if this is the doctrine around here, I will do so in the future.  In regards to acronyms, yes, this was silly of me and I overlooked it, thanks.
