MacBook Pro charging tip <body> I'm about to buy a Mac Book Pro Retina, I'm going to use it mostly at home and when needed I'll take it to my workplace, and so forth.  I know it does not have a removable battery, so I'm wondering what's the best solution to use it at home.  With this is mean, is it best to keep it always plugged in the main or best if I use it as a laptop (fully charge it, remove charger when 100%, use it until discharged, plug it back in, and so forth)?  My purpose is to have the battery live as long as possible.  <comment292320> Duplicate, please see related questions <comment292321> Can u link it so I can see it? I couldn't find it by my own <comment292322> http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/12271/should-i-disconnect-my-macbook-pros-power-cord-when-the-battery-is-fully-charge It's an old question/answer but it still applies. <comment292324> @Brick ok. There are 2 contrary answers with almost same upvotes, and the apple site it refers to is way old. Which is the right one? <comment292326> For many years hardware didn't maximize battery life so people figured it out on their own.  Many of those tactics were legit and some pretty weird and non-sensical.  Today tho battery life and best battery care practices are built into the hardware. You need not worry of overcharging shortening the battery life. <comment292327> @Tyson Tks. I hope it's true! :)
