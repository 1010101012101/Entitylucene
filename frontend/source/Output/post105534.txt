Install CouchDB via Home Brew <body> I'm trying to install CouchDB using Homebrew but it gives me the following error:  precodeError: couchdb dependency spidermonkey was built with the following C++ standard library: libstdc++ (from clang)  This is incompatible with the standard library being used to build couchdb: libc++ (from clang)  Please reinstall spidermonkey using a compatible compiler. hint: Check https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/wiki/C++-Standard-Libraries /code/pre  I went to the given URL and yes: I am on Mavericks GM.  I tried a complete reinstall of homebrew but that still gives me the same error.  But how can I reinstall Spidermonkey with libc++?   <answer107300> I'm not familiar with those specific packages, but based on similar experience with other packages, I'd do  precodebrew rm spidermonkey brew install spidermonkey /code/pre  and then try to install codecouchdb/code again.  <answer120948> I have filed a bug report on the homebrew project. The problem is fixed now.  <comment124666> I think you need to ask the person who set up the homebrew receipe (I know the issues with Macports re the two std C++ libraries andI would guess this is similar)
