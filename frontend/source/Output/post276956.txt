OSX mount a service for eDonkey Network <body> I used to have a computer with Ubuntu, but I changed to a Mac mini.  In Ubuntu I used to install an amule-daemon and amule-web. The daemon was always running on the background, and I was able to access if I was in my home network.  Is something similar for OSX? I mean, some service that I can install and configure and it can run in the background for eDonkey Network?
