Can any recent iPhone benefit from the AirPods instant pairing? <body> The W1 chip makes the AirPods and the new Beats headphones instantly pair with an iPhone. Does this work only with the iPhone 7 or would this work with all recent iPhone models as well?  i.e. Does the W1 need a specific client chip to work its pairing magic or would it work the same way with a recent Bluetooth (4?) chip in an iOS device?  (I know the AirPods also work with regular Bluetooth devices, but I'm particularly interested in the instant pairing feature)  <answer258526> Yes, the iPhone 5 and newer running iOS 10 can be paired with headphones equipped with the W1 chip.  From Apple's website:     Beats Solo3 Wireless is ready to go when you are. They instantly set up – just power on and hold near your iPhone – and then simultaneously connect to your Apple Watch, iPad and Mac*.      *Requires iCloud account and macOS Sierra, iOS 10, or watchOS 3   <comment323186> We're looking for long answers that provide some explanation and context.

No fumbling, manual pairing whatsoever. You need to be signed into iCloud, however. From Apple: "*Requires iCloud account and macOS Sierra, iOS 10, or watchOS 3"
