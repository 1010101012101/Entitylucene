Cannot get duplication of screens to work with mini display between iMac & Macbook <body> Have an iMac 21", 2.5, Mid 2011 and a MacBook Pro Mid 2012 and I just bought a Mini display to connect them through the Thunderbolt. I cannot see that they are connected or the choice to connect it in the screen logo in the menu bar. kbdCommand/kbd kbdF2/kbd doesn't work.   Any idea whats wrong? how can I get the option to have them connected, not for data, just sound and image?  <answer284090> The problem is that you need to use a Thunderbolt Cable to use your iMac in Target Display Mode.  From Apple's website:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jtE6M.png" alt="enter image description here"  From your original question, you mention that you purchased a "mini display" which I can only deduce is that you meant that you bought a "mini Display Port cable."  If this is in fact the case, it's the wrong cable; which is why it's not working.
