All UI apps suddenly turned to not responding <body> Today I was working when all opened apps with UI suddenly turned to "not responding".  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/v6x07.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Nothing was installed last days, neither deleted. When this happened I was just listening music and was working in DraftSight CAD. This happened twice for today.  Console shows a lot of errors like this:  precode11/25/15 15:08:19.153   airportd[58]    SecTaskLoadEntitlements failed error=22 11/25/15 15:08:19.154   airportd[58]    SecTaskLoadEntitlements failed error=22 11/25/15 15:08:33.150   airportd[58]    SecTaskLoadEntitlements failed error=22 11/25/15 15:08:33.150   airportd[58]    SecTaskLoadEntitlements failed error=22 /code/pre  and this  precode11/25/15 16:20:37.000 kernel[0]: memorystatus_thread: idle exiting pid 3831 [systemstatsd] 11/25/15 16:20:38.067 airportd[58]: SecTaskLoadEntitlements failed error=22 11/25/15 16:20:38.070 airportd[58]: SecTaskLoadEntitlements failed error=22 11/25/15 16:20:38.000 kernel[0]: memorystatus_thread: idle exiting pid 3805 [deleted] 11/25/15 16:20:39.000 kernel[0]: memorystatus_thread: idle exiting pid 3933 [bird] 11/25/15 16:20:40.000 kernel[0]: memorystatus_thread: idle exiting pid 3813 [nsurlsessiond] 11/25/15 16:20:41.000 kernel[0]: low swap: suspending pid 2254 (Terminal) 11/25/15 16:20:41.000 kernel[0]: memorystatus_thread: idle exiting pid 4127 [soagent] 11/25/15 16:20:41.760 com.apple.dock.extra[308]: SOHelperCenter main connection interrupted 11/25/15 16:20:42.000 kernel[0]: memorystatus_thread: idle exiting pid 3809 [diagnosticd] 11/25/15 16:20:43.000 kernel[0]: memorystatus_thread: idle exiting pid 3884 [suggestd] 11/25/15 16:20:44.000 kernel[0]: memorystatus_thread: idle exiting pid 4126 [com.apple.iCloud] 11/25/15 16:20:45.000 kernel[0]: memorystatus_thread: idle exiting pid 3786 [networkd_privile] 11/25/15 16:20:46.000 kernel[0]: memorystatus_thread: idle exiting pid 3799 [secd] 11/25/15 16:20:47.000 kernel[0]: low swap: suspending pid 3911 (DraftSight) 11/25/15 16:20:47.000 kernel[0]: memorystatus_thread: idle exiting pid 3828 [nsurlstoraged] 11/25/15 16:20:48.000 kernel[0]: memorystatus_thread: idle exiting pid 3821 [secinitd] 11/25/15 16:20:49.000 kernel[0]: memorystatus_thread: idle exiting pid 3822 [com.apple.Addres] 11/25/15 16:20:50.000 kernel[0]: memorystatus_thread: idle exiting pid 3789 [cfprefsd] 11/25/15 16:20:51.000 kernel[0]: memorystatus_thread: idle exiting pid 3790 [tccd] 11/25/15 16:20:52.000 kernel[0]: memorystatus_thread: idle exiting pid 4131 [com.apple.CodeSi] 11/25/15 16:20:53.034 secinitd[4139]: UID[501]: cache loaded: /System/Library/Caches/com.apple.app-sandbox-cache.plist 11/25/15 16:20:53.168 diagnosticd[4142]: ostraceutil returned error 18176 while linking caches 11/25/15 16:20:53.494 sandboxd[4145]: ([4144]) ostraceutil(4144) System Policy: deny forbidden-link-priv 11/25/15 16:20:53.500 sandboxd[4145]: ([4144]) ostraceutil(4144) System Policy: deny forbidden-link-priv 11/25/15 16:20:53.505 sandboxd[4145]: ([4144]) ostraceutil(4144) System Policy: deny forbidden-link-priv 11/25/15 16:20:53.510 sandboxd[4145]: ([4144]) ostraceutil(4144) System Policy: deny forbidden-link-priv 11/25/15 16:20:54.000 kernel[0]: memorystatus_thread: idle exiting pid 4132 [WirelessRadioMan] 11/25/15 16:20:54.099 CommCenter[293]: Connection interrupted! /code/pre  Full log is here.  My MacBook was still usable, so I was able to open strongForce Quit/strong, strongActivity Monitor/strong and even make a screenshot, but all other UI apps were having a beachball until I did close them.  Global hangup happened around 16:20 and screenshot was taken at 16:23.  My setup: MacBook 15" 2014 Mid, OS X 10.11.1.  Any ideas, what has happened, are welcomed.  <comment262449> Low swap would suggest it's out of memory, if not HD space too, to swap to. <comment262460> It really looks like a swap error. Unfortunately I didn't check that when it happened, but next time I'll do. Thank you for pointing me that. <comment262528> Question should be closed: this is DraftSight bug which drains all available resources in minutes.
