Will using the iphone camera flash as a flashlight for long periods harm it in any way? <body> We have an old iPhone 4 that we use as a music machine in a spare room.  Will using the flash as a nightlight overnight cause any damage?   My guess is no, but a part of me (maybe thinking of old camera flashes) thinks I should ask first.  Thanks.  <answer188332> I would say no for two reasons,  ol liThe flash on an iPhone is an LED which unlike old camera flashes doesn't mind running for extended periods of time./li liFlashlight use isn't limited by iOS. If the letting the flash run for a while would break the phone apple wouldn't allow you to do so or at the very least set a timer to turn it off after so long./li /ol  The only problem T could see is the bulb will eventually burn out, but considering you don't seem to need the camera anyway that probably isn't an issue for you.    <answer282928> Yes the lightbulb wires in a 4 have been know to short this has happened in my grandfathers phone but it took 3 years so it shouldn't be a big issue  <comment222787> Sorry I don't have technical answer for you however I personally would not leave it on for too long or extended periods of time muchness overnight.  If you need a nightlight then go buy one.  $3.96 at Walmart [Meridian Great Value 2-Pack LED Automatic Night Light, Soft White](http://www.walmart.com/ip/Meridian-10237-Meridian-Great-Value-2-Pack-LED-Automatic-Night-Light-Soft-White/26441070). <comment222834> My concern would be battery running down.  But I guess you do this while plugged in?
