unable to move files from external usb disk <body> I have 10.9.4 with a usb external (2tb) disk, formatted with Macos Journalled format. The drive is also a time-machine destination.  I am:  ul liunable to cmd-drag files to move them to another disk (they copy)/li liunable to select multiple files and create a new folder from the selection/li liunable to mkdir on the drive/li /ul   precodeTimsMacBookAir:~ tim$ cd /Volumes/2TB/ TimsMacBookAir:2TB tim$ mkdir test mkdir: test: Permission denied /code/pre   I'm guessing there's permission errors. Here's the ls -l on /Volumes   precodeTimsMacBookAir:Volumes tim$ ls -l total 72 drwxrwxr-x   37 tim   staff   1326  7 Jul 10:19 1TB drwxrwxr-x  319 root  wheel  10914  7 Jul 10:51 2TB lrwxr-xr-x    1 root  admin      1  1 Jul 14:20 Macintosh HD -&gt; / /code/pre   I'm guessing that since the drive is owned by "root" and group "wheel" that is the issue. What does it mean? Can I just chown -R tim:staff it without stuffing anything up (e.g. my Time Machine backups)?  <answer137174> This might be a silly question but are you sure that the drive is mounted read-write.  From memory, if you type in "mount" in a Terminal it should tell you if the drive is mounted read-only as one of the properties in brackets after the drive. Or you could right-click the drive in the Finder and choose Get Info from the context menu and check "Sharing &amp; Permissions" at the bottom of the Info window. I think it'll tell you there if the drive is mounted read-only.  <comment162949> yes, it is mounted read write.
