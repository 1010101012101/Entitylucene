have an iPhone 4s which is locked and I can't unlock it because I've forgotten my Apple ID <body> I have iPhone 4s and forgot Apple id, I tried to reset the id but email password is also forgotten  Can anybody help?  <comment204047> if you tried to reset the password it would be a good assumption that you have been to iforgot.apple.com to do that.   Email is not the only reset method tho, you should have some secret questions that you previously defined that you can answer also. <comment204104> Last ditch attempt is to talk to Apple & try to convince them it's legally yours, receipts etc. Otherwise, it's a brick.
