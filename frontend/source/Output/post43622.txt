Audio output and volume controls gone after updating to iOS 5.1 <body> I have an iPhone 4 (Verizon, Model codeMD146LL/code) and I just upgraded from iOS code5.0.1/code to iOS code5.1 (9B176)/code using strongSettings  General  Software Update/strong.   Immediately after completing the update, I noticed that my phone did not make the strongunlock sound/strong as I unlocked my phone. "Oh, the volume must be down", I thought. So, I made sure my strongmute/strong switch was off and pressed the kbd+/kbd button to increase the volume. Unfortunately, I was greeted by the empty strongringer/strong volume popup:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qvHvj.png" alt="ringer"  hr  "Apple must have changed the default setting for the volume buttons code^^/code"... Surely, I could change it myself! So, I head over to strongSettings  Sounds/strong:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ELSlb.png" alt="settings"  Oh, the settings are right. Hmm... What happens if I move the volume slider?  h2Rejoice! MARIMBA!/h2  hr  Ok, so my phone emcan/em play audio. Can it play music or watch a video?  h2No!/h2  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5riwl.png" alt="music"  h2No!/h2  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uKMXX.png" alt="video 1"  h1NO.../h1  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zowZu.png" alt="video 2"  hr  Other controls:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/A1knB.png" alt="clock"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pbA5d.png" alt="tray"  hr  Hoping that this was just a temporary glitch, I tried the following:  ul liSwitching codeChange with buttons/code on and off/li liTurning my phone on and off/li liHard reset (holding kbdHome/kbd+kbdLock/kbd until it reboots)/li liPlugging and unplugging my earphones/li liPlugging and unplugging the USB charging cable/li /ul  Plugging and unplugging the USB cable seems to fix the issue. However, as soon as I lock the phone, the sound and volume controls are disabled again! Due to this behavior, I'm convinced that this is a software bug and not hardware related (e.g. faulty headphone jack).  Has anyone else experienced this? I'm afraid I'm going to have to do a clean restore or downgrade back to iOS 5.0.  hr  h2Update 1:/h2  strongSettings  General  Reset  Erase All Content and Settings/strong was unsuccessful, even when setting up the phone as a new device (no backup). The bug is still present. I will be trying a clean restore from iTunes soon.  hr  h2Update 2:/h2  Restoring as a new device using iTunes was also unsuccessful. code:(/code From my research, it looks like this bug not specific to my model:  ul lihttps://discussions.apple.com/message/17808462#17808462/li lihttps://discussions.apple.com/message/17799461#17799461/li lihttps://discussions.apple.com/message/17850153#17850153/li /ul  hr  h2Update 3:/h2  After further analysis and comparison, I think that this bug is related to the External Accessory Framework (or similar components). When you are plugged into a compatible device, the controls are hidden, similar to my screenshots above. This may also explain why plugging and unplugging the charger temporarily fixes the problem. em"I'm unplugged; I should enable my volume controls now."/em  <answer44214> From the fact that the issue persists across multiple firmware updates, it's strongalmost definitely/strong a hardware or firmware issue.  My first guess would be some small amount of metallic debris in the dock connector. It's likely that connecting and disconnecting the usb connection forces the software to assume that there is nothing connected, until the next time the phone wakes, when it checks if it's connected to a passive audio-out adapter.  Some metallic debris in the dock connector could force the phone into thinking there is always a line-out adapter present.  Try cleaning the dock connector with compressed air or a soft brush, or look into it with  bright light to see if there are any bent pins.  <comment50882> I have been having the same problem as well. I have basically tried everything you have mentioned above and I got the same results. In every forum you check they will clean the dock and stuff and nothing more. I have tried that and it was never dirty in the first place. I cleaned it again and still nothing. <comment51286> I cleaned the dock connector, and the issue was still there after a hard reset. So, I tried a full restore *one last time*, and it worked! ... So, I don't know what to say. If it is a hardware issue, it's strange that dozens of other people experienced that same thing at the same time. It could be that Apple changed something with the dock connector interface that made it "sensitive" and as such, produces a false-positive more easily. \*shrugs\*
