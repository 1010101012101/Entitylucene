How to set AirPlay device name of the hosting computer? <body> In the AirPlay device list, the name of the hosting computer is always "computer", independently of the computer's actual name.  Is there any way to set this string to a more "expressive" name?  strongEDIT/strong  Setting the host name in the sharing section of the "Systems Preferences" does not work, as the following images demonstrate:  Mac: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oMJAr.png" alt="host"  iPad: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZS0CR.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer101309> Go to codeSystems Preferences -&gt; Sharing/code and edit your computer name.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Cq2Fe.png" alt="enter image description here"  From your iOS device, this name will display when you use AirPlay:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XflbL.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer165167> Here's what I did to rename the strongComputer/strong label in the list of available AirPlay speakers in iTunes.  ol liIn strongFinder/strong, go to your strongApplications/strong folder./li liHold the control button and click on the strongiTunes/strong icon. You'll get a pop-up menu./li liChoose strongShow Package Contents/strong from the pop-up menu. You should now see a strongContents/strong folder in your Finder window./li liUse Finder to navigate to the strongContents  Resources   English.lproj/strong folder./li liOpen the codeLocalizable.strings/code file in a good text editor.  You may want to make a backup copy of codeLocalizable.strings/code before going any further!    TextEdit isn't good enough. It'll show you gibberish. I used TextWrangler, which is free./li liUse kbdCommand/kbd+kbdF/kbd to search for codepb7r8smvm5/code. You should see two lines that look like this:br     &lt;key&gt;pb7r8smvm5&lt;/key&gt;br   &lt;string&gt;Computer&lt;/string&gt;/li   liChange codeComputer/code to whatever label you want (e.g., codeLiving Room/code)./li   liSave the codeLocalizable.strings/code file./li   liQuit strongiTunes/strong and then open it again. Your new label should appear in the list of speakers./li   /ol   These instructions are for Mac OS X. Windows instructions are available.   <comment119275> On which device are you looking at the list? <comment119277> I've looked from the host itself and from a iPad via the Remote app. <comment119341> Thanks for the answer, but a setting of the name in sharing does not work, see edit. <comment119345> Odd. I change it in mine, and it changes to the new name. I tried it on another Mac on my network, and it works on there as well.
