Some settings in `.inputrc` are ignored after upgrading to El Capitan <body> After upgrading to El Capitan, I experienced a strange issue with my code.inputrc/code file:  All codeset .../code that had a trailing comment (e.g. codeset colored-stats on # color for completion options/code) stopped working. Only once I removed the comments, the settings were working again. Strange enough, this is not the case for key mappings (e.g. code"\e\e[D": backward-word # option-left/code), which still work with a trailing comment.  Could someone explain to me why this is happening now, or if something else changed to cause this behavior?
