Negative Image Photos on iPad mini <body> I took a load of photos a couple of years ago using a negative image and "heat sensor" style filter. I'm trying to use my ipad to do this now and cant seem to find the option anywhere. I've tried going into settings and using alternate colours so it gives a negative image to my interface aesthetic and then using the camera to take a negative image, but as soon as i send it via idrop to another device, it comes out in regular colours. I've even tried viewing photos in alternate colour settings and taking screen shots, but once again it reverts it back to regular colours. what should i do? Where is the feature that i had previously used?
