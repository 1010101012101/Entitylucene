Horizontal scroll speed problem in kdiff3 <body> I use kdiff3 Version 0.9.98 (64 bit) on El Capitan.  When comparing files:  ul liusing kbd↑/kbd or kbd↓/kbd keys scrolls files by one line (one press or auto-repeat scrolls one line)/li liusing kbd←/kbd or kbd→/kbd scrolls files horizontally one pixel at a time/li /ul  Is there a way to speed up horizontal scroll? For example one character (better yet 8 characters) at a time instead of pixels?  <comment293885> Same exact issue here. I just installed it and was marveling at its features, then I found this :(
