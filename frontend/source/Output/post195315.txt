Re-install stock Net-SNMP? <body> Apologies in advance if this has been answered.  What is the exact procedure to reset Net-SNMP to "factory defaults" on, say, OSX 10.10 - or any other OSX flavor?  A number of our Xserves were upgraded from 10.6 to 10.8 to 10.9 or 10.10 and in the process appear to have their Net-SNMP executables and/or configuration corrupted - e.g. snmpd daemons crashing frequently, not reporting CPU/mem loads, etc. Tried comparing folder structures between affected and unaffected nodes and haven't gotten too far.  strongEdit/strong: just to be clear, this isn't about snmpd.conf - but about snmp executables, MIBs and what not.  Appreciate any ideas!  <answer195919> After recent OSX upgrades (10.9 and 10.10 desktop versions, not OSX Server, behaviour might be different) I usually control Net-SNMP configuration in two different places:  ul licode/etc/snmp/snmpd.conf/code which should contain your configuration but sometimes get replaced by the default one from OSX/li licode/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.net-snmp.snmpd.plist/code which can disable snmpd launch (look at the codeDisabled/code key)/li /ul  I've never seen anything else being replaced (executables, libraries, etc.).  From 10.6 to 10.10 the Net-SNMP version used might be quite different, so you'll also need to double check your codesnmpd.conf/code file to see if all directives are still valid.  The codesnmpconf/code utility might come handy, have a look at its man page.  <answer233105> The canonical method to reset a net-snmp installation to factory defaults in Mac OS X (there's no difference between client &amp; server in this case) is:  precodesudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.net-snmp.snmpd.plist sudo cp /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf.default /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf sudo rm /usr/share/snmpd.conf sudo rm -rf /var/db/net-snmp /code/pre  This resets the snmpd.conf file to the default &amp; clears out any added users and instance data. This should be valid back to 10.6 or so, possibly earlier, but I'm not sure.  In 10.11.x Apple updated the net-snmp version from 5.6 to 5.6.2.1 which may cause some issues.  <comment235306> Doesn't answer the question, "What is the exact procedure to reset Net-SNMP to "factory defaults" on, say, OSX 10.10 - or any other OSX flavor?"  snmpd.conf files are the same across OSX nodes. <comment284929> There may be issues with the LMSensors MIB on the Xserve hardware <comment374267> Thank you - that didn't help me with the issue - but may be useful in the future.
