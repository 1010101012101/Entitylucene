Where should I place shared folders on an OS X Server? <body> What is the appropriate/reccomended location in the drive hierarchy to place the folders shared by the users accessing the server (as fileserver) ?  Is it in code/Groups/code code/Users/Shared/code or code~/Documents//code ?  Or should I create a separate folder in code/Users/code for each group ?  Is there a document/webpage that supplies instructions about that ?  <answer171546> Generally, the shared folders for a group should go in strongcode/Groups/groupname//code/strong.br code/Users/Shared//code is more designed for local users to share, though there's nothing stopping you from using this too other than it is non-standard.  <answer171615> I add to the correct answer from grgarside that documentation from Apple can be found here http://help.apple.com/advancedserveradmin/mac/4.0/  I have to say the documentation is good but not excellent so here is a little "recipe" for the most common setup.  A common practice is to create codeusers/code, to create codegroups/code, to assign codeusers/code to codegroups/code. (one codeuser/code can belong to none, one, many codegroups/code of course) and finally to give codegroups/code access to shared folders.  When a codegroup/code is created from the Server application check the option  emCreate a shared folder for this group/em. As you click strongOk/strong to confirm the group creation the folder is created as well into code/Groups/code  strongDon't/strong create yourself the folders inside code/Groups/code as this (may) mess things up (this happened to me).  You finally go to the strongSharing/strong pane and add the folders inside code/Groups/code to the list of shared folders. Each shared folder will be automatically set to be read-writeable by its group.  Finally you turn file sharing on.  <comment201821> thank you. By the way I found the documentation here: http://help.apple.com/advancedserveradmin/mac/4.0/
