How to delete everything on an iPod Touch? <body> I would like to give my iPod touch as a gift to someone I know, but I want to be sure that there is nothing left on it to avoid giving data with it...  How do I clean the iPod ?  <answer2932> ol liFully charge the iPod Touch/li liGo to the Settings menu. Scroll down until you see the "General" settings, and hit that, then scan to the very bottom, where you'll see a mini-menu titled "Reset." Press this. This will bring up a few different options, but the one you want is "Erase All Content and Settings." (codeSettings / General / Reset / Erase all/code )/li /ol  you can see full detailed here.  Also you can use itunes, and go to the restore feature. This will take your ipod back to factory default.  <answer19378> I would also suggest renaming the iPod, which you can do by clicking the name in iTunes after you selected it. Then just type the new name. If I recall correctly resetting it does not remove the name.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/llHAI.jpg" alt="Selecting the iPod in iTunes"
