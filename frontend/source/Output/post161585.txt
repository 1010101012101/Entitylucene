folder copy in Finder labels it as incomplete, though copying is completed <body> I am getting this error much too often. I am copying a big number of files from a slow device (external hard drive) to my Mac. When the copy is completed, the last top folder is still marked as "incomplete".  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1eA9j.jpg" alt="enter image description here"   I only managed to clear the mark by creating an empty folder with a different name (say "Folder2"), moving the contents of the folder (say "Folder") there, erasing the (now empty) folder "Folder" and renaming "Folder2". That all looks weird to me. Any suggestions?  strongUpdate:/strong External drive is formatted in FAT32.  <answer252289> Try clicking 'Get Info' and see if it works for you. I know its stupid but it should work.  <comment188830> Is the external HD formatted with HFS (Mac OS X) or FAT32 (Windows)? <comment188834> Looks like the copy is complete, but the icon just hasn't updated properly. Did you try ejecting the drive and then reconnecting? That should force the icon to change. <comment188856> @amanthethy Ejecting external drive does not make any difference, the drive is ejecting successfully, and the copying is not continuing after reconnection. <comment367066> Great tip! Just needed that today!
