1280x720 HiDPI resolution for 2560x1440 monitor <body> [[[ Please... this is not a duplicate. I've tried many/all the suggestions from other questions. Nothing helped.

Can you unmark as duplicate, please? ]]]  I'm trying to set 1280xstrong720/strong HiDPI resolution for 2560x1440 monitor.  That particular resolution does NOT appear in SwitchResX.  And codesudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.windowserver.plist DisplayResolutionEnabled -bool true/code apparently did not do any good.  1280x800 HiDPI works, but it's scaled and sides of the screen are black.  My specs:  ul liMacBook Pro Retina late 2013, 13", El Capitan./li liDell U2713HM, 27", 2560x1440. DisplayPort./li /ul  Since it is such a popular resolution for pre-4k hi-res monitors, I wonder what's going on that it does not work for 1280x720 HiDPI... Monitor compatibility should not be a problem, since the video signal would carry 2560x1440 anyway, making no difference to the monitor itself. So it's just a software issue, I guess! Right?  Any hints?  strongEDIT: RetinaDisplayManager (as mentioned in How can I force specific HiDPI modes?) shows 1280x720 HiDPI, but does not switch to it (nothing happens)./strong  Edit 2: Option-click on "Scaled" in "Displays"-"Resolution" does not seem to give any sensible options to answer my question.  Edit 3: I've disabled SIP (System Integrity Protection) as suggested here - https://www.madrau.com/support/support/srx_1011.html - and added custom resolution in SwitchResX, but when I try to apply (experimental) the custom 1280x720, nothing happens.  <comment347561> **EDIT: RetinaDisplayManager (as mentioned in http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/58061/how-can-i-force-specific-hidpi-modes) shows 1280x720 HiDPI, but does not switch to it (nothing happens).** <comment347563> You don't need to write the same thing in three different places all in bold! <comment347627> Why not make the question really short. Put all your edits in the answer. Even wrong answers explain / show what the right answer will be. As it stands (a long question with edits saying it's not a duplicate) usually ends up with people voting to close as duplicate <comment347823> Thanks. But I have not found a real answer and it is not a duplicate :). <comment349319> Please... this is not a duplicate. I've tried many/all the suggestions from other questions. Nothing helped. This could be specific to the resolution and/or laptop model. I've also upgraded to latest el capitan - no improvement, then to sierra - still no improvement. Can you unmark as duplicate, please? <comment349320> I've managed to find 2 other semi-useful modes in SwitchResX: 1280x800 HiDPI (2560x1600)- nonperfect scaling and black edges of monitor, and a crazy 1504 x 846 HiDPI (whopping 3008 x 1692 - can you believe this "2.5k" monitor handles this "3k" resolution"?) But somewhat slow (but 60Hz). <comment358216> I have an Early 2013 MacBook Pro with Retina Display, using an Apple Thunderbolt Display (27-inch) attached, and have no problem setting the Thunderbolt Display to 1280 x 720 using [Display Menu](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/display-menu/id549083868?mt=12). Have you tried using Display Menu? <comment358229> Thank you. I have tried Display Menu and various other apps. But that particular mode does not seem to be available. Hmm. And I'm talking about 1280 with pixel doubling (2560)
