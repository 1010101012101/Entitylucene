OS X 10.11.6 sublime text 3 change default indentation <body> I am using sublime text 3 on OS X 10.11.6 and the default indentation whenever I create a new file is a single tab.  I want to change this indentation to two spaces.  How can I set this as a default.  strongNote:/strong I know I can go into View  Indentation to change the indentation I am using from single tab to 2 spaces, but I don't want to have to go in and do that for every new file I create anymore.
