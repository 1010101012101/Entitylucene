How to enable location settings for the app when app is not on the list of location services? <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FocMv.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  The screen above describes situation. Any idea how to turn it on? I have ios 10.   The app I mean is stronghostelbookers/strong. It was not happening while ios 9.  Location services for Safari are enabled:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vhabm.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  And there is no my stronghostelbookers/strong app on the list of location services. They are sorted alpha betically.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uixAo.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer252909> I tried by opening http://www.hostelbookers.com in a browser. Same pop up shows up. I guess the website is not coded properly. They just made that button but its not probably working. Best alternative is search by entering city name.  Thanks  <comment314683> Try to enable location services for safari and the try again. <comment314685> It doesnt work. I updated the question.
