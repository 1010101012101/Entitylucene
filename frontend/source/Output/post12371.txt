How can I compress a folder into multiple zip files? <body> I'm on mac osx.  1. Is there any tool to compress a folder into multiple zip files ?  2. Is there any tool to split a compressed zip file into smaller zip files (to open individually later)?  <answer12386> Use the -s switch on the zip command in terminal. So if your folder was called FolderName  precodezip -r -s 64 archive.zip FolderName/ /code/pre  64 is the size of the split (in this case 64Mb).  precodeUse -s to set the split size and create a split archive.   The size is  given  as  a  number  followed optionally  by  one   of  k (kB), m (MB), g (GB), or t (TB) (the default is m). [1] /code/pre  Use zipsplit to split a zip file in to multiple smaller zipfiles.  Use the -n switch to set the size of the splits.

However, I cannot unzip the content, I'm running unzip unix archive.zip but I get "bad zipfile offset (lseek)". Furthermore, I need to extract them in Windows environment as well, and there I only have Windows 7 extractor I guess. <comment12926> you just need to run unzip archive.zip   I'm just checking windows now. <comment12927> @RobZolkos I've already tried and I added to the question the error I get. <comment12928> I just tested it on a folder and it worked fine.  Both zipping and unzipping.  Make sure to unzip in a different folder than the original source.    On Windows it doesn't unzip.  However a freeware unzip program 7Zip http://www.7-zip.org/   can unzip them without a problem. <comment12933> @RobZolkos I get "unsupported compression method" error, do you think the issue is with at extraction step or compression step? <comment13015> Sounds like an issue with compression.  Is what you're compressing just standard files? <comment15670> @RobZolkos The split seemed successful but I couldn't get unzip to work (or even Archive Utility). <comment63503> Answers on Ask Different need to be more than just a link. It's okay to include a link, but please summarize or excerpt it in the answer. The idea is to make the answer stand alone. <comment330137> The link in the answer reference no longer works.
