How to fully export and import the VPN settings on OS X Lion? <body> I discovered the export option from OS X does not export things like: proxies, or DNS settings from the VPN configuration.  How can I export all of these?  <answer45697> Well I found a thread here that seems to accomplish what you're asking.  I can't put it any better than forum poster himself, so here's what he said in case the page isn't working:     I figured out a way to do this, so thought I would post for anyone   following me that has a bunch of VPN settings and doesn't want to   manually key them back in. You will basically have to copy &amp; paste a   few GUIDs to make your old prefs data match your new system. This   worked for me going from one Mac OS X 10.6 SL system to another SL   system. I would imagine similar steps would work for Mac OS X 10.5   Leopard and possibly 10.7 Lion. Here we go:      ol   liFirst, go to Network Preferences on your new machine and add VPN (L2TP), VPN (PPTP), or whatever VPN "interfaces" you need. Do not   create any new VPN configurations at this time. Close Network Prefs./li   liOpen System Profiler, select and copy to the clipboard the Hardware UUID from the Hardware tab./li   liNavigate to ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost and find your old NetworkConnections prefs file. It will have the form of   com.apple.networkConnect..plist. Make a copy of this   file. Replace the  portion w/ the one you copied in   step #2. Don't forget to remove any spaces and the " copy" tag. You   should now have a new file called   com.apple.networkConnect..plist./li   liOpen 2 files in an editor that can handle .plist files (I used TextWrangler): the com.apple.networkConnect..plist file   you just made, and   /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/preferences.plist./li   liIn preferences.plist, look for the GUID of each VPN interface that you've created. The "UserDefinedName" string at the end of the key   will tip you off:/li   /ol      code&lt;key&gt;14A4B264-C231-41FE-857B-EE5557B69851&lt;/key&gt; &lt;dict&gt; &lt;key&gt;DNS&lt;/key&gt;   &lt;dict/&gt; &lt;key&gt;IPv4&lt;/key&gt; &lt;dict&gt; &lt;key&gt;ConfigMethod&lt;/key&gt;   &lt;string&gt;PPP&lt;/string&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; ... &lt;key&gt;UserDefinedName&lt;/key&gt;   &lt;string&gt;VPN (L2TP)&lt;/string&gt; &lt;/dict&gt;/code        The first long string ("14A4B264...") is the part you need. Copy this   to the clipboard.      ol   liNow move over to your com.apple.networkConnect file. Find the key that has all of your old VPN settings emfor that VPN type/em contained   w/in it. Select all of the key name (which is the GUID of your VPN   interface on your old Mac), then paste to replace it w/ the new GUID./li   liRepeat steps 5 &amp; 6 for each VPN interface you need. In my case, there were 2: L2TP and PPTP./li   liSave your changes and close the com.apple.networkConnect file. Close the preferences.plist file WITHOUT saving anything./li   liOpen your Network Preferences, select your VPN interface(s), and you should see your past configurations./li   /ol   Hope this helps you!  <comment45292> What export option is that? <comment51247> When you select a VPN connection in Network Preferences, under the cog, you have the option to Export Configuration.  That export option. <comment51323> Would this be of any assistance to you? http://hintsforums.macworld.com/showthread.php?t=116582 <comment51927> @sudorm-rf, your answer looks good - you should post it. <comment51936> @JW01: Well, that forum answer wasn't my work.  I guess I could copy it onto here (and give credit), but I wasn't sure if that was the right thing to do. <comment51954> @sudorm-rf, it's valuable knowledge that would be added to the community - I think you should go ahead and add it. A lot of of us quote things from the Apple Support KB - same principle. :) <comment52066> @JW01: Okay, posted it.
