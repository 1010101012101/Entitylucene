iOS 9 Update Failed in iPhone & iPad <body> "Software update failed. An error occurred downloading iOS 9" - weird message after clicking 'Download and install'. Restarting devices didn't help. What's the problem?  <answer205940> iOS 9 just came out and since many are trying to update to it, it seems like a server overload on Apple's part, this article from 9to5Mac also confirms this. Unfortunately, all you can do is be patient. I still only see the iOS 8.4.1 update available on my iPhone 5S.  <answer205941> Golden Rule - don't do the Download &amp; Install at the same time.    Hit "Download only" when iTunes asks you. Saves a lot of heartache in the long run.   It ought to go without saying that you should both sync &amp; backup to iTunes before doing any upgrade.  One very smart thing to do before trying to long-haul any large file is to reboot all your network hardware; modem, router, puter etc.br I got my update first try, but I couldn't for the life of me persuade it to login to iCloud. Power-cycling my WiFi [which had been running for months since its last cycle] simply 'fixed it'.    As with anything so vague as 'switch it off then on again' - YMMV.  <answer207597> Another easy fix is to insure there is enough memory remaining.  I had to delete or transfer a lot of photos, videos, music, etc. to get back enough space to download the new iOS.   <comment248312> Most likely it's just the Software Update servers being busy, try again a bit later. You are not alone: http://9to5mac.com/2015/09/16/ios-9-update-issues/ I already updated my iPhone and currently downloading the iPad update, but I'm using iTunes. <comment248314> @IlariScheinin Wow, I was in the middle of writing my answer, citing the same 9to5Mac article, while you posted your comment. Pretty funny. <comment248407> Update today's morning, is was the first time issue on my side.
