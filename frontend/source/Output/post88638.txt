Is FileVault 2 + SSD + OverProvisioning possible? <body> As the title says, could someone accomplish this?  I couldn't.  FileVault 2 wizard tells me that the disk isn't compatible with it.  I have only 3 partitions on main disk, and Recovery HD was cloned from original Macbook HD.  precodemacbook-pro:~ $ diskutil list /dev/disk0    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *256.1 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI                         209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:                  Apple_HFS MacOS                   200.0 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3 /code/pre  ...  precodemacbook-pro:~$ sudo gpt -r show -l disk0       start       size  index  contents           0          1         PMBR           1          1         Pri GPT header           2         32         Pri GPT table          34          6                   40     409600      1  GPT part - "EFI System Partition"      409640  390625000      2  GPT part - "Customer"   391034640  107536528            498571168    1269528      3  GPT part - "Recovery HD"   499840696     277463            500118159         32         Sec GPT table   500118191          1         Sec GPT header /code/pre  There are 2 places with unpartitionated space. One after my Macintosh "HD" and one that resulted from resizing a 700MB partition to on 650MB for the Recovery partition.

I partitioned the disk completely from terminal.  disk0 is my internal drive, this is the one going be partitioned. 3 partitions specified, one for OS X, one for Recovery HD, and one with the remaining space for unallocated space/free space/over provisioning. The size parameter (20G) for the last partition isn't really used because diskutil does assign to it the remaining space left unused by the previous two  partitions, ie. 256G-200.1G-650M=free space.

If not, we can help you edit your question to provide more details on what you've tried, what exactly you don't get. See the guides on [about] and [ask] if you don't get an answer and decide to edit your question. They are often helpful in refining / reframing your query. <comment184720> For me all I needed was to unmount and use `sudo asr adjust --target /dev/disk0s3 --settype "Apple_Boot"`. This is after using dd to copy the partition back into place (saved with dd too). Size of the partition does not matter.
