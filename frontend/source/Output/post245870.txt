I upgraded my CC programs and now they are no longer on the dock. How to get them there? <body> I upgraded my Creative Cloud programs and now they are no longer on the dock. How may I get them there (Photoshop, Illustrator, Muse, etc)   <answer245873> The simplest way to put anything in the Dock is just to find it in your Applications folder &amp; drag it there   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/86fHZ.png" alt="enter image description here"  it will become a permanent addition.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FcGNW.png" alt="enter image description here"  You can remove it again by dragging the Dock icon out to the desktop...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9LJ8m.png" alt="enter image description here"  None of this will affect the app itself, only its appearance in the Dock.  <comment303165> Or, while they are running, right-click on the Dock icon and pin them. <comment303453> Thank you, but, I cannot right-click with my Mac mouse. Also I tried dragging the icon to the dock and it just goes back into Applications. <comment303700> Thank you, but, I cannot right-click with my Mac mouse.
