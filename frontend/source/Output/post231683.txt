Can I adjust the amount of review time when using play/pause F7 button and iTunes? <body> Which is to say, I'm working on transcribing a passage from an mp3 file. The play/pause (F7 on MacBook Air and OSX 10.11.3) button is very convenient; however, the play/pause cycle rewinds the pointer for a 20 second review. When I'm typically capturing a sentence or at most two at a time, this is by and far too much. Is this a setting I can adjust?
