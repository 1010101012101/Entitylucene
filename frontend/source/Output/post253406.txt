iOS 10 (iPhone) Restrictions & Siri Search Results <body> I've had this issue with previous versions of iOS as well, and have not yet found a solution.  So it seems that while you can disable Siri's ability to display web search results, I can still pull up web-related content such as Rotten Tomatoes movie reviews.    Is there any way to set Siri (either using default restrictions or Apple Configurator) to basically only allow Siri to operate against the iOS device itself without pulling content from the web?    So far I haven't found a way to do this aside from disabling Siri altogether.
