Is there an option/shortcut in Safari 6 to focus the search results after a search? <body> When I write a search query in the url bar in Chrome, I want the focus to go on the search result.  In Chrome I can search for something, then hit kbdtab/kbd and select the results with my arrow keys (and open the link with kbdreturn/kbd).   Is there any option/shortcut to focus the page after search?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MPywf.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer57553> It's almost the same in Safari but you need to hit kbdtab/kbd strongthree/strong times instead of one.  ol liSearch in the url bar/li liHit kbdenter/kbd/li liHit kbdtab/kbd tree times and use the kbd&#x2191;/kbd/kbd&#x2193;/kbd to navigate between the results/li /ol  <answer58039> I haven't been able to replicate the exact Chrome behaviour, but I adapted this extension for Safari, and maybe it'll help if you're used to keyboard shortcuts. What it does:  ul liAfter searching, remove focus from the search field/li liNavigate results using codej/code (down), codek/code (up) and code//code (search field focus)/li /ul  The extension and source can be found here.   <answer60133> Let me make a clarification.  The problem is real, and we got it with the unique URL bar behaviour in Safari 6.  If you make a google search from the URL bar, Safari doesn't bring the focus to the document, but (for some reason, e.g. assuming you continue with typing new search keywords) leaves the focus in the URL bar. This causes that you can't instantly use the very advanced keyboard handling of Google's search results pages - which is: from the input field TAB gives you a selector arrow and you can navigate with keyboard arrows.  For using the search result page's keyboard handling, you have to bring the focus to the document. Now, whether it's easy or not depends on your keyboard settings in System Preferences. If the setting which says "Full Keyboard Access: In windows and dialogs, press Tab to move keyboard focus between:" is set to "Text boxes and lists only", then it's easy to bring the focus to the document by hitting Tab only once. But if it's set to "All controls" (which actually happens a lot if you're accustomted to using the keyboard in UI navigation), then Safari brings you through all the bookmark bar items and such buttons when you hit Tab. This is definitely a no-way.  You always need to switch back to "Text box only" (by hitting Ctrl-F7). The problem is that in this mode you can't navigate between form elements like checkboxes and buttons.  In Chrome the problem doesn't exist, because Chrome always brings the focus to the document when doing a search.  Apple should definitely address this issue.  Until then, a workaround can be that you hit Ctrl-F (moves focus to in-page search), then hit Tab 4x.  <answer106153> This is a serious problem for keyboard users in Safari. The omnibox can't be used for search via google without having to use the mouse to open search results.  <answer106201> If you haven't enabled full keyboard access from System Preferences, you can press tab twice.  If you have enabled full keyboard access, you can press shift-tab three times.  <answer216459> If you customize your toolbar to have no items to the right of the search bar, you can move your focus to the page with a single press of kbdtab/kbd.  <comment66115> Sorry, but I don't really understand what you mean. When I press **tab** in Chrome while in the searchbar, I can only select my bookmarks. <comment66116> when you use the search feature in chrome, it gives you focus on the page of the results, instead of leaving the focus on the url bar <comment66117> That's Chrome's **instant** feature. Look for it in the Chrome preferences. If my memory is correct, Chrome does not enable this by default as *anything* you enter the url bar gets transmitted to Google instantly. Safari does not have it. <comment66118> instant updates the page as you type, i'm talking about focus on the page after you hit enter <comment66119> Ok, I understand what you mean now. I'll edit your question to make it more clear. <comment66122> i guess you haven't any bookmarks. the first tab goes to the "download" button, the other on the bookmarks. if you have many (like me), you have to hit tab too many times :( <comment66123> Ok, I noticed you already mentioned the excessive tabbing. I removed it from the question as this actually is this answer. <comment66124> @pistacchio Are you talking about Safari now? I do have a lot of bookmarks. The first tab jumps to the search bar of the webpage, the second tab jumps to the preview of the first search results (but does not select it), the third tab selects the second search result. <comment66125> @pistacchio I'm using Safari 6 in Mountain lion. Are you using Safari 6 in Lion? <comment66128> yes, i haven't upgraded to ML yet. <comment155825> I like Safari 7 selecting the search bar after the search. Thus I can easily refine my search. <comment155832> @pistacchio — You have to tab so much because your System Prefs have been changed. In the System Prefs, set Tab to switch between text fields and lists only. Thus you will need much less Tabs. <comment164420> Is it possible to create an extension to have the best of both worlds? <comment181884> This seems to have broken again in Safari 8. I have to hit tab, then the down arrow to get the first search result. <comment214537> You'll see a link to the Safari extension in the README of the link. It works great!
