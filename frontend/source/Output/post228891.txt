Support for special Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 hotkeys on OS X 10.11 <body> I'm trying to get the special keys on my Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 working under OS X El Capitan. Officially, Microsoft only offers limited support for this keyboard on Mac.  The multimedia keys (mute/volume/play) work, but the home/search/mail/calculator keys don't. The official IntelliType Pro software also lacks a way to configure the programmable hotkeys.  Are there any unofficial tools to get them working?  <answer233840> You can use ControllerMate by Ordered Bytes (costs $25) to regain control over the special keys of the Natural Ergonomic 4000. It should recognise all keys, even the shortcut keys.  Note: To get the "My Favourites" keys working, download the profile at: http://www.orderedbytes.com/controllermate/compatibility/#microsoft/ergonomic_keyboard_4000  <comment286014> It's a $25 tool, but it matches my requirements. <comment286097> Updated answer with mention of price (and link!) Luckily it has a demo. Try it out before buying! It can be a bit complex at first.
