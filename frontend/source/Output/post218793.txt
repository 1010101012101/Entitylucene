How to share an iCloud calendar with a Google/Android user? <body> I've been trying to share an iCloud calendar with an Android user but can't seem to find any way to share a read/write version of it.  This AskDifferent gives a great explanation how to share a read-only version, but I need to share a read-write version.  My problem is that the user needs to be an iCloud user.  But a web-only iCloud user doesn't have access to the calendar.  And the Android user does not own any Apple products.  Is there any way to share the calendar?  <comment264550> You mean if you do a Private Calendar share, as mentioned in the linked post, that your invitee can't see that on the web version of their iCloud calendar? or that they cannot see any iCloud calendar at all, not even one of their own making? [This is going to be hard to test for anyone who *does* have Apple productsâ€¦ i.e. most people in here] <comment264618> @Tetsujin - according to Apple docs, a web-only iCloud user gets access only to Pages, Numbers and KeyNote (https://support.apple.com/kb/PH2609?locale=en_US&viewlocale=en_US)  To get access to anything else, you need to connect an apple device (Mac, iOS) to iCould to enable the other features.  So an Android only user would not have access to the iCloud Calendar at all. <comment264621> Then I guess you're stuck, I'm afraid. Might have to look at CalDAV etc instead & work the other way round. <comment264623> @Tetsujin - I'm not entirely sure what you mean by "work the other way around"?  I presume you mean create a Google calendar, but is there a seamless way to sync it with an iCloud calendar without needing a PC/etc? <comment264624> No, you can sync it to a Mac, PC or iPhone etc but not to iCloud itself.
