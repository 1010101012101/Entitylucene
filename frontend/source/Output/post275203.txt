Assigning Desktops to Multiple Monitors on MacBook Pro <body> Running El Capitan, I have two external monitors and the MBP monitor, three total. When the MBP is not hooked to any monitors, I have four Spaces set up, each with their own desktop background (A, B, C &amp; D). When the external monitors are hooked up, I get two more spaces ("Displays have separate Spaces" is checked) with two more background pictures (E &amp; F). I arrange them in a V:  precodeExt1 -- Ext2   \\    //      MBP /code/pre  The top left monitor becomes my main display (Desktop #1) and has the four spaces. I don't know why it does this but it does, and that's what I want, too. So it has desktop backgrounds A-D. Top right gets picture E (Desktop #2), and the MBP gets picture F (Desktop #3).  This is exactly what I want, as A &amp; E complement one another. Except sometimes (maybe 3% of the time) the strongMBP becomes Desktop #2 and gets background E and the upper right becomes Desktop #3 and gets background F, which is just visually jarring to me/strong.  When it happens, everything is still arranged in the V that I want, so it's not like the OS is confusing what's what.  strongQ: Why does this happen or how can I fix it?/strong  <comment346132> Have a look at this [answer](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/257864/119271) <comment346133> It's a work laptop, so I can't install third party software on it. <comment346852> Poked around and googled, both without success. There's very little in the way of settings that I can find to affect this. <comment347080> I am using an app called TotalSpaces2 that can mess with the spaces. Maybe it can do what you want, or you could contact the devs and see if they can help.
