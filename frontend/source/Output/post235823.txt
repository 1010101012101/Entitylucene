how can I import figures from a pdf into a power point slide? <body> I have tried importing from a PDF, and using the insert tool.  I tried copy and paste, I also tried converting the pdf to pptx then importing it. Each time, the figure is missing, and the caption is there.  I need the figure, and the caption.   I heard there is an easy way to import pdf figures to power-point, how can i do it?  <comment288566> PowerPoint is not Apple software, do you mean Keynote? <comment288567> Power Point is an MS-office product, with an official Mac release.  "office 2011" is the version.
