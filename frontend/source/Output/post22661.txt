Problem with "Open With" menu <body> I ran this command in Terminal, which supposedly clears all duplicate applications from the "Open Withâ€¦" menu and now many of my files are just showing up as blank images (.zip files, .dmg files, .rar, etc.) and they don't open with the correct application. I did log  out and log back in after doing this. Help!!  code/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -kill -r -domain user/code  <answer22662> Logout and then Login.  It's common for this to happen. If the problem doesn't fix itself upon logging back in it's just a matter of Rebuilding the Launch Services.  Try it this way:     /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support/lsregister   -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user   Alternatively, you can use the commercial utility MacPilot:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JIdw8.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment25261> Ah...thank you SOOO much!!!
