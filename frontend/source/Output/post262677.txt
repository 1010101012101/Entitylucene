EraCheck shows [failed] com.apple.bird.plist <body> When I run EtraCheck it shows "[failed]    com.apple.bird.plist.". [failed] is shown in red text in EtraCheck. Does anybody have any idea why this shows up in EtraCheck like this?  For some reason My keyboard won't type the letter on this site. I noticed it on one other site. I forget which one. You really never realize how much you need the letter "t" until you have to paste it in every time that you need it.
