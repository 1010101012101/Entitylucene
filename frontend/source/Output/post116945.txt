Bootcamping a Mac. Got windows installed correctly but now it cant see the USB that Bootcamp had me make with all the Mac drivers <body> Pretty much as title says.  Went through Bootcamp Assistant, created the USB with Mac versions of the Windows drivers, and installed Windows.  Can successfully dual boot, however, none of my devices work.  When I plug in the USB to install those drivers, Windows doesn't recognize it.  Any thoughts? Thanks!  <answer116946> There might be a problem with the USB3 drivers. You can download the latest bootcamp drivers on Apple's website.  <answer116948> I see your problem. You should try to install the latest drivers for BOOTCAMP.
