How to fix delay between wakeup and password entry <body> When booting up my computer, or even just awakening it from a long sleep, it takes a while for me to be able to enter my password. The box is there, but I can't move my mouse or type into the box. My screen is frozen. It usually lasts for about a minute, but sometimes longer.  Any ideas on how to analyze/fix this?  <comment266346> I have a similar problem, but instead of seeing a frozen screen, its just black for about a minute or so. This just started happening a few days ago. Very irritating. <comment346217> How long does it take?  What model of MacBook is it?
