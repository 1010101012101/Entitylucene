iMessage won't send on iOS 7 <body> With my iPhone 5 with iOS 7.0.2 on Wifi or on 3G my iMessages won't send (Progress bar stuck in the middle of the screen).  Rebooting or Airplane mode won't change anything.   <answer103885> There seems to be a bug with iOS7 :   To make it work again here is a procedure :   ul liDisable iMessages (Settings  Messages) /li liReset Network settings (Settings  General  Reset  Reset Network settings)/li liEnable iMessages (Settings  Messages)/li /ul  <answer110427> I had the same problem.  I was typing in the subject line.  Went to settings, messages and shut off the subject line!  Works great now.  <comment122326> Did you get a carrier update?  I got one, and chose "later", and since then I have the same issue.  Trying your fix now. <comment122327> I don't remember having one. <comment123562> I tried these steps before the carrier update and it didn't work.  Now I did the carrier update and it does work.   Question:  why does the carrier update only show up in iTunes?  When I checked Software Update in my iPhone, it didn't see the update.  When I connected to my Mac, iTunes told me to install it.  Odd?
