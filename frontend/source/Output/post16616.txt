Extracting data from old Mac resource files <body> What utility or tool that runs which under Mac OS X 10.6 can I use to extract data (icon images and strings, etc.) from old Mac OS 7 (and earlier) resource files/resource forks?  (...files created using ResEdit.)  <answer16617> Rezycle might work for you. Let us know.  <answer65049> Abet slightly unstable, the resource editor Rezilla runs under 10.7.4.  <answer160181> On OSX you can access the raw resource fork of a file like this:  precodecp resource_file/..namedfork/rsrc  resource_fork /code/pre  There's also the system utilities DeRez/Rez (available in OSX 10.7 and some other versions) which allows for extraction of resource fork data into a form for use by the codeRez/code resource compiler  - e.g. extract icon data from an Icon file:  precodeDeRez -only icns Icon^M &gt; icon /code/pre  It should be noted that the resulting files from both of the above commands require additional processing to convert the resources to a suitable form.  See related question on Icon files.
