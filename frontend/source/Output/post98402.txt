Is it possible to hook automator to the "before download" event in Safari? <body> I find that I desperately NEED Safari to ask me where I would like something saved (and allow me to rename it) (you know.. a Save As dialog) before it is downloaded - on an individual, download by download basis.  This MUST be the default action for downloading a file; Modifier keys and right-clicks are unacceptable.  Safari does not appear to have this option available to me.  So, I am open to suggestions.  Is there a way to do this with Automator?  Is there a file system trick to accomplish this?  Safari Extension?  Anything?   Perhaps an http/s proxy program that accomplishes this?  <answer98431> You can hold down the control key or click with your right mouse button and select save as...  But I must admit that doesn't work always because some downloads aren't clicked on. I personally dislike this solution because you have to click more ( but save as already gives you more to click then needed in my opinion ;) )  You can do this with this workaround using automator:     ol   liOpen the Automator tool/li   liCreate a new "Folder Action" type document./li   liAssign the Folder Action to the Downloads folder./li   liAdd these actions (in order): Move Finder Items, Reveal Finder Items,   Name Single Item./li   liSet the "Move Finder Items" action to use the Downloads folder as it's   default (or whichever folder you are most likely to move things to - I   use Downloads because most of the time I'm moving files into an   archive structure and want it to be easy to skip this process by just   hitting Return and leaving the file in Downloads when I don't do   that.)/li   liOpen the options for the "Move Finder Items" action and tick the   checkbox for "Show this action when the workflow runs."/li   liOpen the options for the "Name Single Item" action and tick the   checkbox for "Show this action when the workflow runs."/li   /ol   As quoted from: https://superuser.com/questions/201298/to-prompt-a-folder-location-when-safari-downloads-a-file  <comment115510> I guess being prompted *after* the file has been downloaded is not an option, is it? <comment115653> I've seen this solution before - and tried it.  But having the workflow be post-download presents a few issues.  First, that workflow doesnt tell you what file is being worked on - so if you have multiple downloads going on it wouldn't work well.  Second, it just isn't familiar.  It feels wrong.  Thank you for your answer though. <comment115654> @Thecafremo: you would be correct.
