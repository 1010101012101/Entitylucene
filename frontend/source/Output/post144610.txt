Applications frequently become permanently unresponsive <body> I frequently have applications become unresponsive while they're in the background. That is, I'm not able to switch back to them*, and the Force Quit Applications window shows them as "Not Responding". They never become responsive again no matter how long I wait.   Some features that make this problem unusual:  ul liIt's not limited to one or two applications. It's happened with MS Office applications, Textedit, BBEdit, Evernote, OpenOffice, Preview, and others.  /li liIt's not limited to times when the application is doing something intensive. In fact, it usually happens to apps that have been in the background and not doing anything in particular. /li liI've never observed it to happen to web browsers or to music players that are playing music. /li liIt doesn't seem to be triggered by other applications doing things that are CPU or memory-intensive./li liOther applications are not slowing down or hanging when it happens./li liThe non-responding application shows &lt; 1% CPU usage in Activity Monitor. /li liIf I force quit the application and restart it, then the problem usually doesn't recur quickly. /li /ul  Does this suggest any potential causes or troubleshooting steps? I know the usual advice is to either start with a new account or disable all of my other programs and customizations one by one, but I'm hoping that the specific features of this problem might help me proceed in a more targeted way.    System info:  Macbook Pro, 2012 model, OS 10.9.4, 8GB RAM, 500GB HDD with 160GB free  * Specifically, what I mean is that I can cmd-tab to the application's icon, but the program in the foreground doesn't change. If I expose one of its windows, I can move the window around, but clicking in it doesn't bring the application to the foreground or affect the contents of the window. Notably, I do not get the beachball / pinwheel pointer when hovering over it, as I do in other cases when an application is stuck.   strongupdate/strong:   Here's the system log from an incident when OpenOffice became unresponsive. I discovered it at 8:17. I don't know exactly when it failed, but the last log message and the last revision time on my auto-saved files is 7:46, so I assume it was within 5 minutes of that. Note that the OpenOffice error in the log (appears as codesoffice/code) shows up twice, five minutes apart, meaning that the first one wasn't fatal and so I suspect the second wasn't the cause of the hang either.   <answer144925> OK,  I will work with you on this step by step.  First to eliminate the following:  precodeprocess plugin-container[1362] caught causing excessive wakeups. EXC_RESOURCE supressed due to audio playback 9/11/14 7:58:33.000 AM kernel[0]: process firefox[1359] caught causing excessive wakeups.

Go to Tools : Add-Ons : Plugins (in Firefox), and one-by-one, for each plugin listed, please do the following:  1) Disable the plugin. 2) Restart Firefox and check if you still see the message.  ul listrongUpdate and part 2:/strong/li /ul  Your Preview is generating lots of problems?  Lets start with obvious.     Open Preview:      File,      Open Recent,      Clear Menu   emThe reason: There seems to be a croup file in your Preview./em  <comment170344> A detailed Console report would help to maybe see what is happening. Use a stuck application name to search your Console data base for your report. <comment170355> Is that the problem of your Mac OS? Have you ever reinstalled OS for your Mac? <comment170629> @Buscar웃 There don't seem to be any log entries related to the stuck applications. <comment170630> If you would be so kind and publish a log anyway, you might have missed something in it. <comment170645> I'll do that next time I catch it -- as is so often the case, asking for help with the problem seems to have made it temporarily disappear. <comment170717> @Buscar웃 I've added a log. <comment170718> Thanks, will be reading it today. There is one non-fatal that has to do with Preview? and bunch of errors with the connection... <comment170719> Could you also look/Publish this one "Submitted crash report: file:///Users/hibounce/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/Finder_2014-09-10-220724_healslime.crash" from whom is that? <comment170737> The culprit appears to be Flash. I have it set to request permission on all sites, and the error reliably appears about 30 seconds after permitting it on one of the pages I use frequently. I will refrain from using it and see if that helps. <comment170738> Preview was crashing when I tried to paste an image from the clipboard. It didn't resemble the problem with apps hanging, and it doesn't seem to be recurring now. <comment170741> The 3 finder crash reports are for my user account. I don't recall seeing anything unusual happen at the time. They were, in order, SIGSEGV, SIGBUS, and SIGSEGV. I don't see anything else in there that I'm able to interpret. In my DiagnosticReports folder I have reports for clusters of 3-4 crashes like that every few days in the past couple of weeks. <comment170747> Preview hasn't been consistently causing problems, just this morning. I went ahead and cleared the recent files menu.
