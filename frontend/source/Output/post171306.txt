Can't change color default folders yosemite 10.10.2 <body> I've got a brand new mac with Yosemite 10.10.2 but like everybody I just hate that blue color of the folders  I'm looking for a proper way to change ALL folders's color  I've seen that http://yukiyamashina.github.io/blog/2014/10/19/how-to-change-the-color-of-default-folder-icons-in-OS-X-Yosemite/  But I can't find the folder CoreServices/CoreTypes.bundle/Contents/Resources/  Isn't strange or because I've got Yosemite 10.10.2 ?  What shall I do ?  thanks  <answer171307> Try candy Bar, I use it to change my icons and it works all the time.  It's no longer supported by it's developers but the current version still works   http://www.panic.com/blog/candybar-mountain-lion-and-beyond/  <comment201554> I've tried to download CandyBar but it's not supported by my Yosemite 10.10.2 "Unqualified system" <comment201557> I used LiteIcon: http://www.freemacsoft.net/liteicon/ to replace Yosemite default folder with Mavericks default folder. That's MUCH less garish. <comment201567> Yea it says unqualified on my system as well (10.10.2) but still works for me :) <comment201568> I just checked it on a newly set up machine and the folder is there. Are you sure you're looking for that folder under `/System/Library` and not `/Library` or `~/Library`? <comment201572> I can't apply ! <comment201691> mmgross, thanks you're right, i was looking under /library and not /System/library <comment201692> Litelcon unfortunally doesn't work under 10.10.2... But if you think the yukiyamashina is perillous, I shall wait <comment347334> LiteIcon seems to work fine for me
