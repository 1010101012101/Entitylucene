How to call a specific subroutine of an AppleScript from another AppleScript? <body> I understand that it is possible to trigger an .scpt file that is saved somewhere on my computer from within a different .scpt file.  Can I call a specific subroutine of that .scpt file from a different .scpt file? I want to skip over the entire script, and only run the code that is found in one, specific subroutine  I understand that I can simply copy the subroutine into its own, dedicated .scpt file and accomplish what I want that way. This method is demonstrated in this answer. However, I would prefer not to have to do this, for the sake of convenience.  hr  In addition, is it possible to also pass variables to that subroutine? My current need does not require this ability, but I am still curious.  hr  <answer275495> h1AppleScript's codeload script/code/h1  AppleScript's codeload script/code command will do what you want.  h2Example/h2  On your Desktop, save a code.scpt/code file containing the following codesaySomething/code handler:  precodeon saySomething()     say "hello" end saySomething /code/pre  Then within another script you can call codesaySomething/code:   precodeset myOtherScript to load script (alias ((path to desktop folder as string) &amp; "external.scpt")) myOtherScript's saySomething() /code/pre  The returned object from codeload script/code is a script object. Once loaded, the script object is treated as local and can have its local handles called, including with parameters.

This is actually answered by the link, within the linked answer, in your OP and also touched on by Graham Miln's answer. /li li   Can I call a specific subroutine of that .scpt file from a different .scpt file? I want to skip over the entire script, and only run the code that is found in one, specific subroutine.   This is the good question because the documentation and examples focus on the emhandlers/em themselves and tend to show that external scripts being called should just be a collection of emhandlers/em and no other AppleScript emcode/em.   Well, as an old saying goes... proof is in the pudding... The answer is yes, you can call a emhandler/em from another emfilename.scpt/em file that contains any valid AppleScript emcode/em. strongNote that the target of the codeload script/code emcommand/em will load the entire emscript/em to memory however, will not execute anything other then the emhandler(s)/em called./strong/li li   In addition, is it possible to also pass variables to that subroutine?   Providing the emhandler/em being called is written to take emparameters/em, then yes you can pass it a emvariable/em that has already been assigned and pass it as a emparameter/em./li /ul
