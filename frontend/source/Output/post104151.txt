How to script number pad key <body> We use an auto login script using ARD to avoid visiting each station in our lab. Mountain Lion no longer works so that a cursor appears at the login screen. I've tried numerous scripts to activate the cursor to no avail. Pressing 5 on they numerical pad will do it as will a generic mouse down action. To avoid having to do this at each computer, how can I script one of these actions in an osascript?  thank you in advance.  <answer104204> Try using the codekey code/code command:  precodeosascript -e 'tell app "System Events" to key code 87' /code/pre  See Events.h for the key codes. Here are the key codes for all numpad keys:  precode65 KeypadDecimal 67 KeypadMultiply 69 KeypadPlus 71 KeypadClear 75 KeypadDivide 76 KeypadEnter 78 KeypadMinus 81 KeypadEquals 82 Keypad0 83 Keypad1 84 Keypad2 85 Keypad3 86 Keypad4 87 Keypad5 88 Keypad6 89 Keypad7 91 Keypad8 92 Keypad9 /code/pre  <comment122758> Thanks, Lauri. I had tried that and it didn't work. If I control stations one at a time in ARD and press the 5num key it works but not within a script.
