On my iPad, how can I tell if a website is secure on Safari? <body> Does the web address have to be in green, or is it secure if it's in black?  <answer201247> If the site is being accessed over HTTPS, then the lock icon is shown (in black).  If the HTTPS certificate has been verified, the lock icon is shown in green.  hr  Both are secure, however the latter vouches for the authenticity of the site as well as the security of the connection.  For example:   ul lihttps://www.icloud.com/ shows a stronggreen/strong lock icon, having been verified as Apple Inc.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wPYkh.png" alt="iCloud verified as being owned by Apple Inc. in Cupertino, California, US"/li lihttps://georgegarside.com/blog/ shows a strongblack/strong lock icon. Even though it's secure over HTTPS, it hasn't been verified.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rESMh.png" alt="George Garside&#39;s Blog not verified"/li /ul  You can visit the two links on your iPad to see the difference in lock icon.  <comment243970> A black lock does indicate verification; it just hasn't been verified as rigorously as a a green icon.  If a site hasn't been verified but requests a secure connection, Safari won't let you connect.
