Mountain Lion way to QuickLook folders <body> The freeware Folder.qlgenerator was already broken by Lion.  precodedefaults write QLEnableXRayFolders -bool true /code/pre  does not appear to work in ML. Does anyone have a replacement solution? I&rsquo;m looking at a large file tree, and I&rsquo;d like some convenient way to remind myself of what is where. Expanding everything in List View would send most of the information off the bottom of the screen.  <answer85707> I am not a code writer but you can try this.  In finder select the Icon view.  In finder click on the view than on the "show status bar"  That will open a slider at the bottom right.  Using the slider you can adjust the size of the icons to fit your screen.   A nice view of all folders, not xray but a good overview.  FYI: I have OSX 10.8.2 and the xray does not wok with it.  <answer85828> You are right with "Once upon the Time", that feature does not work on Lion. There is currently no known work around.  <comment98756> defaults write com.apple.finder QLEnableXRayFolders 1 <comment98757> @Borderline, as I wrote, this does not appear to work in either Lion or Mountain Lion. I'll try againâ€”but do you have it working on one of these systems? <comment98763> I don't seem to have been clear. Once upon a time, when you did Quick Look on a folder, a list of the _contents_ came up in the QuickView. So you didn't need to click to open the folder for an idea what was in it.  I don't really need the icons bigger in the existing window. I can just get better glasses. :-) <comment98765> "Expanding everything in List View would send most of the information off the bottom of the screen." I was trying to help with this issue you mentioned.
