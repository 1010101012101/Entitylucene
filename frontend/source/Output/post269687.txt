Cannot update from OS X 10.8.5 <body> I have a MacBook Air from 2013. I had a lot of stuff on it so I decided to delete everything. Now that I have a whole new Mac I can't seem to get any newer updates. I can't update from OS X 10.8.5. I don't get any updates in the software update in App Store.   Does this have something to do with me deleting the hard drive and then restoring a new one?
