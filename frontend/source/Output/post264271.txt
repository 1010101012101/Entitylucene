What is this menu bar icon with three connected dots and a down arrow? <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/A6YRG.png" alt=""  It doesn't respond to clicks or right clicks.  I don't recall when it first appeared.  I'm running 10.11.6 El Capitan.  <answer264275> LibreOffice update icon.  Googling the image led me to MacRumours Forums     It is the LibreOffice update dialog box that triggers this. Clicking   that icon opens the LibreOffice update dialog box, but it does not put   it in front of other applications. That is what is leading to   everyone's confusion about this icon.      To verify, I closed the update dialog, put LibreOffice in front of my   other windows, and clicked the icon. The update dialog appears again.
