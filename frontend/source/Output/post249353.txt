Inaccessible tty still has some bash processes <body> This is a very strange situation. I'm on OS X 10.11.6  I have an old tty still hanging around (codettys001/code) but I don't know how to access it and why its still there. It simply does not have any window on the os x desktop. I'm on ttys000.  precode$ tty /dev/ttys000 /code/pre  This means I'm currently on ttys000  precode$ w 22:01  up 15 days,  7:47, 3 users, load averages: 1.65 1.43 1.45 USER     TTY      FROM              LOGIN@  IDLE WHAT Sidharth console  -                30Jul16 15days - Sidharth s000     -                13:48       - w Sidharth s001     -                Thu13    9:12 -bash /code/pre  I can understand the login from console (it happens automatically) but where is this s001 (i.e. codettys001/code) coming from -- I can't switch to it -- I don't see any os x terminal windows corresponding to ttys001.   precodeUSER       PID  PPID  PGID   SESS JOBC STAT   TT       TIME COMMAND root     30994 30725 30994      0    0 Ss   s000    0:00.04 login -pf    Sidharth Sidharth 30995 30994 30995      0    1 S    s000    0:00.33 -bash root     32409 30995 32409      0    1 R+   s000    0:00.01 ps aj root     26065     1 26065      0    0 Ss+  s001    0:00.04 login -pfl Sidharth /bin/bash -c exec -la bash /bin/bash Sidharth 26066 26065 26065      0    0 S+   s001    0:00.28 -bash Sidharth 29465 26066 26065      0    0 S+   s001    0:00.00 -bash /code/pre  These are the various processes with associated ttys. Again, I can't understand the life of me what 26065, 26066 and 29465 (all associated with 26065) are doing/why are they there.  Some observations: the parent of 30944 is 30725 which is the Mac Terminal application (this makes sense). But equally interesting is that the parent of 26065 (corresponding to codelogin -pfl Sidharth /bin/bash -c exec -la bash /bin/bash/code is launchd i.e. pid 1)     I've noticed stuff like this before: there is usually an old ttys but its not visible.  ul liNope I'don't have any additional tabs open in my os x terminal program that could cause this /li liMy question is this: Why is my ttys001 inaccessible? How do I "get to" ttys001 /li /ul  <comment309267> `ps aj` prints the Parent PID of every process as well, which may give a clue regarding the origin of the processes running on `s001`. <comment309274> @patrix thanks... added that `ps aj` info to the question. <comment309291> PPID 1 means that whatever process initially run `login` has terminated already. The command line looks very much like what is run when opening a new Terminal tab though, so it is most likely a leftover.
