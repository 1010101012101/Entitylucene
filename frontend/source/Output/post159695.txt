songs on my iphone don't appear on itunes iOS7 <body> There are songs on my iPhone that I have already removed from iTunes, they still show up after synching.  Any ideas how to get the songs off my iPhone? It's an iPhone 5c running iOS7.  <comment187676> Do you have the iPhone's Music setting in iTunes set to Manually Manage? If so, disable that and they should be removed. Otherwise you can manually delete them from the phone.
