Unable to delete files from finder? <body> I did option-3 on finder - which puts the files into cascading directories mode.  Then I have selected a few files with the intention to delete them (see the screenshot).   But there is no option to 'delete' - either from popup or from menu items (see second screenshot).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jolLR.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2q4YG.png" alt="enter image description here"  Note: the files are all owned by my user as is the containing directory:  precodedrwxr-xr-x  21 steboesch  wheel    714 Aug 18 15:28 util -rw-r--r--   1 steboesch  wheel   5189 Aug 18 15:28 SqlBattery.scala -rw-r--r--   1 steboesch  wheel   2266 Aug 18 15:28 SparkSqlQueryBenchmark.scala -rw-r--r--   1 steboesch  wheel   3356 Aug 18 15:28 SparkSqlIgniteSql.scala -rw-r--r--   1 steboesch  wheel   1250 Aug 18 15:28 SparkNode.scala -rw-r--r--   1 steboesch  wheel   1433 Aug 18 15:28 SparkIgniteAbstractBenchmark.scala -rw-r--r--   1 steboesch  wheel   1219 Aug 18 15:28 SparkDriverNode.scala -rw-r--r--   1 steboesch  wheel   5997 Aug 18 15:28 SparkCoreRDDBenchmark.scala -rw-r--r--   1 steboesch  wheel   1244 Aug 18 15:28 SparkBenchmarkArguments.scala -rw-r--r--   1 steboesch  wheel   4350 Aug 18 15:28 SparkAbstractBenchmark.scala -rw-r--r--   1 steboesch  wheel   8590 Aug 18 15:28 DataGenerator.scala -rw-r--r--   1 steboesch  wheel   7602 Aug 18 15:28 CoreBattery.scala drwxr-xr-x   3 steboesch  wheel    102 Aug 18 15:28 .. -rw-r--r--@  1 steboesch  wheel   2527 Aug 18 17:56 SparkIgniteSqlBenchmark.scala /code/pre  <answer200963> Pressing kbdCommand ⌘/kbdkbd3/kbd in strongFinder/strong changes to strongColumns/strong view and selected files can be deleted by first moving them to the strongTrash/strong by pressing kbdCommand ⌘/kbdkbdDelete/kbd or by clicking strongMove to Trash/strong from the strongFile/strong menu in strongFinder/strong.  You can then empty the strongTrash/strong by pressing:kbdShift/kbdkbdCommand ⌘/kbdkbdDelete/kbd  <comment242246> Is is then your understanding that   the cascading view does not allow for deleting files? <comment242247> @javadba, It is not called "cascading view", it's **Columns** view and files certainly can be deleted in any view in **Finder**, sans read-only media.  The image of your **Finder  File** menu shows **Move to Trash** and that's "delete", so to speak, in OS X. <comment242264> That's what I was looking for. The terminology is Mac-ish: ok now I got it.
