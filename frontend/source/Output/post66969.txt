Repair or recover drive from recovery mode <body> My main HDD is failing to boot. (Neither Normal, Safe mode nor Single User). I can only boot from Recovery Mode or DVD.  The scenario was the following:  ul liComputer was asleep (lid down)./li liLifted the lid then connected USB mouse./li liMouse nor trackpad nor keyboard responded./li liClosed the lid, removed the USB mouse then opened the lid again./li liTrackpad and keyboard responsive once again, but after trying to close some programs computer freezes./li liShutdown computer by pressing power button for 10 seconds./li liAt restart computer doesn't boot anymore./li /ul  When booting in verbose I noticed the following:  precode... ...

I booted in recovery mode then tried verify and repair disk with disk utilities put is seems to be OK. However Macintosh HD cannot be mounted.  Tried fsck_hfs from Recovery Mode terminal then got Macintosh HD cannot be repaired.  I'll want to know if there is anyway to rescue the system without reinstalling Mac OSX or at least a way to recover some files from the drive before reinstalling Mac OSX.  <answer66995> ul lithere may be no way to rescue the system without reinstalling Mac OSX./li liyou might look into booting into single-user mode/li lithat said, to the extent you care about un-backed up data on the hard drive,  it might be wise to recover files BEFORE trying to reinstall/recover further/li liI have had good luck with DiskWarrior/li liYou MAY be able to boot the broken disk/laptop in "Target Disk Mode" - if it has Firewire, if you have the cable, and if you have another Mac with Firewire to attach it to./li liFailing that, you or a person with appropriate tools could remove the internal disk drive, attach it to a USB/SATA adapter of the appropriate kind and use DiskWarrior on it./li /ul  Good Luck!  <answer265365> You should boot into single-user mode (hit kbdCMD/kbd-kbdS/kbd at startup) and try to run repair manually:  precodefsck -y /code/pre  Then codeexit/code/codereboot/code.  hr  If won't help, to repair a volume that won't mount, follow this guide.  Here are different methods of mounting of the volume:  ul licodesudo mount -t hfs /dev/disk3s2 /mnt/code (create code/mnt/code folder before: codesudo mkdir /mnt/code)/li licodesudo /System/Library/Filesystems/hfs.fs/hfs.util -MU disk3s2 ~/temp/ fixed readonly nosuid nodev/code/li licodesudo diskutil mount readOnly /dev/disk3s2/code/li /ul  h3codetestdisk/code/h3  You can use codetestdisk/code command to repair the partition table:  precodesudo testdisk ~/temp/flashdrive.dmg /code/pre  See the following demonstration.  h3codeddrescue/code/h3  If won't work, use codeddrescue/code utility to image the HFS+ volume:  precodesudo ddrescue -v /dev/disk3s2 ~/temp/foobar.dmg ~/temp/logfile.log /code/pre  Then try to mount the image it-self:  precode$ hdiutil attach -nomount ~/temp/foobar.dmg /dev/disk5                                                 $ diskutil list ... /dev/disk5 #:   TYPE NAME     SIZE       IDENTIFIER 0:        foobar   *500.1 GB   disk5  $ mount -t hfs -r /dev/disk5 ~/temp/ mount_hfs: Invalid argument  $ mount -t hfs -r /dev/disk5s0 ~/temp/ GetMasterBlock: Error 2 opening /dev/rdisk5s0 mount_hfs: No such file or directory  $ mount /dev/disk5 ~/temp/ mount: You must specify a filesystem type with -t.  $ diskutil mount readOnly /dev/disk5 Volume on disk5 failed to mount; if it has a partitioning scheme, use "diskutil mountDisk" If the volume is damaged, try the "readOnly" option  $ diskutil mountDisk readOnly /dev/disk5 Volume(s) mounted successfully # Despite the promising "Volume(s) mounted successfully" message, nothing was mounted  $ mount -t hfs -r /dev/disk5s0 ~/temp/ GetMasterBlock: Error 2 opening /dev/rdisk5s0 mount_hfs: No such file or directory  $ mount -t hfs -r /dev/disk5 ~/temp/ GetMasterBlock: Error 16 opening /dev/rdisk5 mount_hfs: Resource busy /code/pre  h3DiskWarrior/h3  ol licodesudo hdiutil mount -nomount -readwrite ~/temp/foobar.dmg/code./li liThe image should now appear in DiskWarrior or Disk Utility for repair./li /ol  See: Recovering Disk Images with DiskWarrior  <comment78939> I can't boot into single user mode.  Tried DiskWarrior but it doesn't see the drive (what I managed to read is that if the volume cannot be mounted then DiskWarrior will not see it). I'll try with something like Data Rescue to recover my files. If that fails then I'll try removing the HDD and connect it to another computer because the other mac around is a white macbook with firewire 400 while mine is firewire 800, unless that doesn't matter to try the Target Disk Mode. Thanks <comment78940> Sorry, my bad. I actually can boot into single user mode. I'll try to backup my data from there <comment79136> As I recall, one can connect Firewire 400 to Firewire 800 if you have the right cable.  It automatically will downgrade the speed to 400...
