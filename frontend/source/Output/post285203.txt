How to renew Apple Developer Membership manually? <body> How can I renew my Apple Developer Membership account manually? Is it possible to do this?  I know that developer.apple.com/support/renewal describes renewing but does not explain manual renewal.  <answer285234>    You can renew starting 30 days before the expiration date of your existing membership or any time after it expires. Your expiration date is available in your account on the developer website. To renew, sign in to your account with the Apple ID you used to enroll, and click the "Renew Membership‚Äù button.   https://developer.apple.com/support/renewal/  <comment359636> [https://developer.apple.com/support/renewal/](https://developer.apple.com/support/renewal/) <comment359657> @user3439894 I know that page but there not explains manual renewaling.
