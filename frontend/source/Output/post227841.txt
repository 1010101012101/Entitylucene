Open an app in low resolution but not zoomed <body> Can I open an application on a retina display tricking it that it's actually using a low resolution display, but not doubling the pixels? Yes, I want tiny text.  <answer227878> You can't open a single app in low resolution unscaled, but you can set the display to a non-HiDPI resolution such as 2880Ã—1800 using an app such as RDM.
