Macbook Pro (Late 2011) Bootcamp and USB boot questions <body> I have a Macbook Pro with an OWC DataDoubler drive caddy replacing the Superdrive (installed at an Apple premium reseller, when I bought it, so I can still have my warranty).  The main drive slot has an SSD, and the Superdrive slot has the original 750GB hard drive. It all works great, and I have Lion installed on the SSD - blazing fast :) I also have the Superdrive on an external USB enclosure, also works fine.  Problem is, I would like to install Windows on the secondary hard disk. I tried using Bootcamp, but it wouldn't originally let me create the USB install disk (I've overcome that with the tip described here) but even if I use the USB Superdrive, I always get the "Boot device not found, press any key" message.  So, my question is: what am I doing wrong? Is it possible to install Windows on a secondary hard drive? How can I avoid the "Boot device not found..." message?  Thanks for any help!  <answer50641> Look here:   ul liHow can I install boot camp off a Windows 7 USB flash drive? /li /ul  and  here:   ul liInstall Bootcamp Windows7 off external USB optical drive on Lion system /li /ul  Maybe rEFIt will work for you too, but be aware of this:  ul liInstalled reFIT on Lion and now I can&#39;t login/li /ul  <answer51177> I have solved this myself on a Mac Pro with 6 internal disks, where I wanted to install BootCamp on a already partitioned disk which isn't the primary disk.  I've made a few notes about it here, but it's rather technical and incomplete: Install Windows without BootCamp Assistant  The other "problem" for me is that I can't use the "Startup Disk" System Preferences panel to choose that partition to boot Windows from.  As a work-around, I use two tricks:  ol liI hold down the Option key at startup so that the Mac shows me a list of all bootable disks, including the Windows partition./li liI use a shell script which finds the Windows partition and set it as a one-time startup partition, which is a hint I got from MacOSHints. The script follows and should be saved as "BootCamp.command":/li /ol  pre     #! /bin/bash     diskutil list  /tmp/connecteddrives.txt     INPUT=/tmp/connecteddrives.txt     driveid1=$(grep Microsoft "${INPUT}" | awk '{print $8}')     echo $driveid1     sudo /usr/sbin/bless --device /dev/$driveid1 --setBoot --legacy --nextonly     rm /tmp/connecteddrives.txt     osascript -e 'tell application "Finder" to restart'     exit 0 /pre  <answer69628> I had this same problem. I used Daemon tools Lite for mac (free) to mount the .iso file and bootcamp let me create the partition, Then I used Winclone 3.5 (not free) to restore an old image I made.   If you don't have an image, you'll have to find a friend with the same model macbook pro you have and see if they will do a fresh windows 7 install that you can then use winclone to copy.  <comment58019> Bootcamp will make a partition and use it for Windows, no? Or what kind of error do you get when you make a partition on the secondary drive?
