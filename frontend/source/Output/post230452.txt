Why does my iMac go to sleep while I am using it? <body> My iMac (2014) running OS X 10.11.3 goes to sleep every now and then several times a day while I am using it.  I do not lose any work, but it is very annoying.  I do not have any hot-corners for sleep, or Energy Saver settings that cause the behavior.  After monitoring my machine using Terminal:  precodepmset -g pslo 2016-03-08 17:52:48 -0600 IORegisterForSystemPower: ...Sleeping... /code/pre  When the event happens, I checked out the logs:  Console.app  System Log Queries  All Messages     3/8/16 5:52:48.206 PM CommCenter[299]: Telling CSI to go low power.   Why is CommCenter telling CSI to go to low power while I am actively using my iMac?  <answer231137> I did this to stop the CommCenter:  precodelaunchctl remove com.apple.CommCenter /code/pre  <answer234040> Well, that did not work.  Now I'm going to try this in Terminal.app for 5 hours of "don't go to sleep on me":  precodecaffeinate -t 18000 /code/pre  Info on that command is:  precodeman caffeinate /code/pre  <comment282226> could it be some kind of infrared signal? did you try disabling the IR control? <comment282607> No IR control on my iMac.
