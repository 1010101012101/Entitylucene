A3 Certificate not allowed in macOS? <body> I have a type A3 Digital Certificate and the issuer (Certisign) claims that after OS 10.11 Apple removed the ability to install this type of Certificate. Can anyone confirm if that is really the case? I found it hard to believe... Thank you Alex  <comment332505> An A3 certificate? I've never heard of that type - nor can I find anything on Google.
