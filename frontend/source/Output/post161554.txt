contents-immutable and locking the Dock <body> I have the following:  precodedefaults write com.apple.Dock contents-immutable -bool yes defaults write com.apple.Dock size-immutable -bool yes defaults write com.apple.Dock position-immutable -bool yes /code/pre  I can run them fine from the Admin account and it works, but is there a way to do this on a non-admin account? Even Sudo did not seem to work exactly.  Can I just do a chattr +i? what is the immutable string actually doing in the background?  This is running 10.9.x   <answer161560> The property list you are referring to is com.apple.dock.plist. Try using com.apple.dock as the domain.  <comment188808> Hey, what do you mean by using that as a domain? <comment188810> @Frank Sorry, the arguments for the defaults command are `write domain key value` so I meant `defaults write com.apple.dock â€¦` (with a lower case d). For more context, see the trouble when Apple renamed com.apple.Finder to com.apple.finder. <comment313247> At least as far back as OS X 10.8 (and possibly earlier), the case of the domain makes no difference. `defaults read com.apple.dock` is the same as `defaults read COM.Apple.Dock`
