iMac 27inch + SSD and HD + Filevault + Yosemite <body> I have an iMac 2011, 27 inch model.   It's got a 1TB hard drive, but I want to add a SSD drive then upgrade to Yosemite. I also require FileVault 2.  How hard is it to add the SSD drive, then do a new Yosemite install?   Is it difficult to have the system/applications on the SSD, and the userdata on the HDD?  What are the best practice suggestions I should take?   Will FileVault 2 cause any problems? Will it encrypt both the system and the user data?   THanks
