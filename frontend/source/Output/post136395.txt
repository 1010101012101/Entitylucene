Designating the startup space/desktop? <body> Is there a way to get OSX 10.9.3 to startup in the same space (eg. always startup on Desktop1) at every boot up?   Right now it puts you back in the last space  you were in when you closed down. I only use 3 spaces but one is a public start space (a space to run iTunes etc), the next is for websurfing &amp; amusement and the Desktop3 "back room" is for coding.. I don't always want to boot up back into my last work session environment.  I want to start on a standard desktop then figure out what I'm doing for that session. (set the music, adjust screen saver times etc.) then move into my other spaces. Like coming into a house at the end of the day: Start at the front of the house, set the tone/environment depending on what you feel like doing, then move further in.  Is there a way to do this?
