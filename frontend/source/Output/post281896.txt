How can I record synthesizer music to iPad? <body> I have an iPad Air 2 and I just bought Loopy HD.  I also have a Roland synthesizer with MIDI output. Is there a MIDI to lightning cable?  I want to play something on my synth and add it to Loopy.  Thanks!  <answer281903> As long as the synth you have is core MIDI compatible. You may use a Apple iPad Camera Connection Kit or the Apple USB 3 Camera Connection Kit if it requires a bit of power output.  Other alternatives to just straight up USB for non-core MIDI products (products that require drivers) include iRig accessories, or plugKEY.   You will need this cable to make it work.  Best of Luck!  <comment354886> Thanks! I have a Roland E-38. It doesn't have any USB outputs though... you can look it up to see what I mean. <comment354961> Added a link to an MIDI to USB output... Checked the Manufacturer's docs, and it should work... <comment354981> Could this work? Basically I would do MIDI to Lightning directly. http://www.guitarcenter.com/IK-Multimedia/iRig-MIDI-2-1403532937623.gc
