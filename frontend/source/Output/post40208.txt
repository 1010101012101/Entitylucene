How do I open XLS files in Numbers? <body> I've just bought Numbers and I'm trying to open some XLS files.  They're in Excel '97 format, not encrypted, and with no password set.  However, when I try to open them, I get this error message:  precode"The document is encrypted and can't be opened" /code/pre  They open fine in openoffice.  How do I open them in Numbers?  <answer40226> Sometimes a xls file don't have password to open it, but it has it to avoid modifying certain fields, you can validate that.  Also, if you have access to a PC with Windows you can try to save your xls file in a newer format.  Another alternative is to use a program like parallels or VMware to install/emulate window on your Mac.  <comment45476> Are you sure that the file isn't corrupted? Can you regenerate or get it from source again? <comment45486> Did you try to same them from OpenOffice into .xls again and then open them in Numbers? <comment45489> @Robin - yes, I'm sure there's nothing wrong with the files. <comment45490> @Patrix - yes. I've even tried saving as an ODS, then opening that ODS and re-saving as an XLS. Still no good. <comment45491> I think you're right about it having a protected field.  However I don't have access to Windows or a newer version of Excel - I need to make this work in Numbers. <comment45498> If the xls has a protected field, then Numbers wont open the file and it would show the "The document is encrypted and can't be opened" message. Don't know if there is a hack or something like that, but I read on an Apple forum about this constrain. <comment45693> OK - where do I file a bug? That's a stupid error message if the problem is that Numbers doesn't support encrypted fields
