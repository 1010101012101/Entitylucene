Is it possible to check which application has accessed a file last? <body> I can check when a file was accessed last with codels -lu path/to/file | awk '{print $6,$7,$8}'/code but can I also see what application accessed it?  <comment107796> Not in general in OSX. If you can run another task and keep it running then you can log as the file changes <comment107801> And what about the user (`root`, `_spotlight`, `username`, etc...)? Is it registered who accessed the file? <comment107890> No, it's not. The only user info attached to a file in OS X is owner and group and ACLs for read/write/execute permissions. Accessing a file doesn't record anything on disk except the atime.
