Need to Switch from Mac Thunderbird to Apple Mail. But First I want to backup Mac Thunderbird. How Can I Do It? <body> I recently switched to a new company. As I am the sales head, I receive a lot of emails to look at daily. Earlier I was using Mac Thunderbird as my daily email client but now here it is mandatory to use Apple Mail. So I need to switch from Mac Thunderbird to Apple Mail. The only thing that I require is to backup all my emails before I make the switch so that I don't loose any while migration. I am looking for a quick backup solution that won't take long to do the backup procedure.   Thanks for the help in advance.  <answer257772> Here are the instructions to transition from Thunderbird to Apple Mail  <answer258655> Have you tried Time Machine to Backup your emails?  A more elaborate procedure is explained here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd2YaBCXpaM  You can also opt for third party applications: http://mac.softpedia.com/get/Utilities/Mail-Backup-X.shtml  I hope this helps.

You should provide a substantial answer either in your own words and or a combination with using quoting as necessary. The bottom line is, your answer, as currently written, is a non-answer by AD and SE standards.

Please read: http://apple.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-ask. <comment322214> Maybe is quite easier, configure IMAP (if already done), push all importants mails to server syncing your e-mails, configure Mail.app, and you are done. If you dont know what is IMAP, just ask to your IT guy. <comment322215> WOW, have you look how old are the software?? Reference 10.4 as current OS. <comment324777> Thanks for the solution George. I tried the Time machine backup thing but it was a long and tiring procedure, instead, I tried the mail backup x application, which was fast and efficient enough to backup my emails safely. And also the inbuilt email converter was a unique thing that I found in this application. It is an all-rounder tool for email backup, restoration, and conversion,
