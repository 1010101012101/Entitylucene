Keyboard shortcuts for non-menued items (iTunes 11)? <body> I'd like to have keyboard shortcuts for the horizontal menu bar in iTunes 11.  This one:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UOQwh.png" alt="itunes screenshot"  Is there a way (maybe using Automator or Terminal?) to create shortcuts for items not in a menu?  <answer119307> Try this:  In Automator:  1, Create a new service. And Set the strongService receives/strong to strongnone/strong in  strongiTunes/strong  2, Add a 'Run Applescript' Action  3, Add this code.   precodeactivate application "iTunes"     delay 0.4      set the menuItem to "Artists"     tell application "System Events"         try               tell application process "iTunes" to click radio button menuItem of radio group 1 of splitter group 1 of window 1           on error             try                 tell application process "iTunes" to click radio button menuItem of radio group 1 of window 1             on error errorM                  display dialog errorM              end try         end try     end tell /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IWuVx.png" alt="enter image description here"  4, Save the service as:strongSelect Artist/strong  5, open the folder: ~/Library/Services  6, Select the strongSelect Artist/strong service and duplicate it.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Lj6Pm.png" alt="enter image description here"   7, rename the file to another Menu item you want i.e strongSelect Genres/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vCf0f.png" alt="enter image description here"  8, Open the strongSelect Genres/strong in Automator by double clicking it.  9, In the Applescript code change the line: codeset the menuItem to "Artists"/code  to codeset the menuItem to "Genres"/code  10, save the changes to the file.  11, repeat steps 6 to 10 for each menu item. Changing the strongSelect Artist/strong to the correct file name for the menu item and the codeset the menuItem to "Artist"/code to the correct text for the menu item.  12, Open System Preference and go to the strongshort cuts/strong Tab in the strongKeyboards/strong Preference pane.  13, Select the strongServices/strong menu on the left and scroll down to the strongGeneral/strong menu short cuts on the right.  There you should see your new service menu items. Add your short cuts to them.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GLWrA.png" alt="enter image description here"  Close the System Preference when done.  14, Quit and relaunch iTunes. This will make sure the short cuts are registered with it.  Remember to not use any existing Short cuts that may clash. Doing so may also mean the short cut do not show up or work.  You may be told that iTunes or Automator Runner is not allowed to control your computer.  To counter that you can first add iTunes by dragging 'n' dropping it into the strongAccessibility/strong group in the Security and Privacy System preferences and ticking it.  Or add it at the time.  There should be no need to add Automator Runner.  If you are testing from Automator.app then Automator.app will also need to be added.  <comment139179> Cool, thanks for the detailed response. Worked perfectly after I set the Accessibility.
