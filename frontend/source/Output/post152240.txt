Run script (a la LaunchDaemon) before automatic app resume kicks in <body> I have an encrypted disk image that I use to store some sensitive data. It also includes a license key file for an application. Upon boot, I automatically mount this disk which restores the pre-defined symlinks and makes the license available for the application.  However, when restarting with "reopen windows when logging back in", it seems the windows are restored embefore/em the Volume is able to mount. Causing the application to warn about an unlicensed copy.  I already moved the volume mounting from my local user "Login items" (which I presume are simply LaunchAgents) to a global LaunchDaemon, which should make it trigger before login, but it still triggers too late.  Any other ways to handle this elegantly?
