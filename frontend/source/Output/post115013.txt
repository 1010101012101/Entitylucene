Completion for git commands <body> I recently switched from using an Ubuntu box for the last 7 years to a Mac. I have read other posts like Switching from Ubuntu to OS X and I&#39;m lost and What is the difference between iTerm2 and Terminal?  Why don't iTerm2 and Terminal complete the arguments for a command?  Eg. If I do codegi/code+kbdTab/kbd, it autocompletes this word to codegit/code which is good. When I add a space and try coderemo/code+kbdTab/kbd, why don't I get it autocompleted to coderemote/code like in Ubuntu. I have to type everything manually after the word codegit/code. Same for other commands.  Am I doing something wrong, or missing something?  (Please note that I am not talking about the kbdcmd/kbd + kbd;/kbd shortcut which autocompletes previously typed entries in iTerm2.)   <answer115015> The easiest way to get autocompletion on OS X is to switch your shell to codezsh/code.  ul liChange default shell from bash to zsh/li /ul  You can test things by running codezsh/code in iTerm and terminal before making the switch above. If you really want to stick with codebash/code you can start with these two questions:  ul liIs there a way to auto-complete the open command in Terminal?/li liHow can I make autocomplete in the shell work with case-folding?/li /ul  <answer115214> A solution when switching from ubuntu is to use homebrew, a package manager for Mac OSX. In particular, for codegit/code, you will have included a number of additions including bash completion. This will be true for other programs which are faliliar for developpers, like codemake/code.  In 2 steps:   ol liinstall with coderuby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)"/code/li liRun codebrew doctor/code to get your path set up properly/li liInstall git and bash completion: codebrew install git bash-completion/code/li liAdd the command return in the previous step in your code.bash_profile/code./li liRestart your bash sessions once the new tools and configuration are written to your file system. /li /ol  More on this howto.  <answer115229> I have two suggestions:  ol liuse fish, it's really simple and easy  a. extend it by using oh-my-fish/li lizsh with oh-my-zsh. zsh is already installed so you don't need to do much.  a. codechsh -s /bin/zsh/code  b. logout and login again  c. execute this to install oh-my-zsh codewget --no-check-certificate https://raw.github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh -O - | sh/code more info here: https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/li /ol  I use codeoh-my-zsh/code but codefish/code is great as well.  <answer115231> This somewhat sidesteps the problem, in case someone wants to keep the Apple-provided version of Git on their system.  You can create aliases in the .gitconfig file in your home directory for shorter git commands. For example, I have git set up so codegit st/code runs codegit status/code instead.  Example aliases in .gitconfig:  precode[alias]     co = checkout     ci = commit     st = status     br = branch /code/pre  <answer131912> One option that might help is to use code.git-completion.bash/code for bash emgit/em autocompletion.  It lets you type git commands and then have autocomplete for the remote name (e.g. 'origin' or 'heroku') and then (and more significantly) for the repository branch names.  See https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/55886/24565  Your download the file frombr https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash  <answer131936> For those looking for a command completion solution for bash that's as easy to use as zsh + oh-my-zsh, there's now the bash-it project. Which, in its own words, is "a shameless ripoff of oh-my-zsh" -- nothing wrong with that really!  It sets up a plugin like architecture like oh-my-zsh does, where you can bring things in and out of your environment easily and get new things via sync'ing to their github project.  Installation in three easy steps:  ol liCheck a clone of this repo: codegit clone https://github.com/revans/bash-it.git ~/.bash_it/code/li liRun code~/.bash_it/install.sh/code (it automatically backs up your code~/.bash_profile/code)/li liEdit your code~/.bash_profile/code file in order to customize bash-it./li /ol  If you're afraid of a full-on switch to codezsh/code, codebash-it/code is a nice middle ground that keeps you on codebash/code but gives you a lot of powerful plugins to extend your environment with.  <comment134673> Sweet! zsh is good! Never bothered to switch from bash :).`Update:` Using zsh with oh-my-zsh is amazing. <comment134900> Terminal and iTerm2 do not complete the command It is the shell and its add ons which can be the same in Linux and OSX so you need to state what your full setup is in Linux and duplicate that in OSX. <comment177552> ahhh love oh-my-zsh <comment190809> You want autocomplete for git - see http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/55875/24565
