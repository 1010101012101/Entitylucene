Is there an iOS equivalent of Bonjour for Mac? <body> you know how you can search your locally networked devices on Bonjour in Safari on Macs, and once you select a device, Safari asks you to log in with a username and password to get to the device's settings?  Well i was wondering if I can do the same thing on an iPhone or iPad. Since there is no official Bonjour on iOS, is there a third party app or something that can do this?  <answer189988> Fing is what you're looking for, you can see who is connected and all the info but Im pretty shure you cant connect to the devices, just as in a PC, Mac, etc...  http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/overlook-fing/id430921107  Hope it Helps.  <answer205058> There is, in fact, Bonjour on iOS: https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/NetServices/Introduction.html
