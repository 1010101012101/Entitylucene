What is the purpose of "~/.adobe" directory? <body> I was cleaning my home directory and found hidden .adobe folder with two files in it:  precodemd5 containing only one line "F894CEFB…" userid containing also one line "424E8…" /code/pre  I deleted whole folder and whole Adobe Creative Suite seems to work. Does anybody know what are these files for? Where does userid comes from?  <answer102665> This answer in a discussion on Slashdot suggests this folder is not related to your Creative Suite installation, but to Adobe Flash. I have it too, and the files in it are two years old. A candidate for deletion!
