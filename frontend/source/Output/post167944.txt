Flashing icons (crashing gui) in OSX Yosemite <body> Since yesterday the icons on the top-right of my macbook (yosemite) are constantly flashing. Looking at system.log it seems like the gui is crashing and restarting every second. Here is a copy of the crash report.  This started happening quite suddenly, I didn't perform any system changed. The only thing I did recently is install a printer driver, but I doubt that that is related.  precodeJeroens-MBP:log jeroen$ tail -fn0 system.log Jan 18 11:44:35 Jeroens-MBP Spotlight[341]: spot: agent checkin Jan 18 11:44:35 Jeroens-MBP SystemUIServer[549]: Cannot find executable for CFBundle 0x7f8441e06120 &lt;/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu Extras/Clock.menu&gt; (not loaded) Jan 18 11:44:35 Jeroens-MBP SystemUIServer[549]: Cannot find executable for CFBundle 0x7f8441d0a530 &lt;/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu Extras/Volume.menu&gt; (not loaded) Jan 18 11:44:35 Jeroens-MBP backupd[136]: Property list invalid for format: 200 (property lists cannot contain NULL) Jan 18 11:44:35 Jeroens-MBP SystemUIServer[549]: *** WARNING: Method convertRectToBase: in class NSView is deprecated on 10.7 and later.
