Change Date/Time format in the Screen Shot filename? <body> By default, screenshot files are saved with names like this:  codeScreen Shot 2016-07-12 at 1.07.34 PM.png/code  The date format is great, but the time format annoys me because it doesn't sort automatically. Is there any way to change the format to:  codeScreen Shot 2016-07-12 at 13.07.34.png/code  <answer245774> It's using the system's standard date/time display format which you can customise in the 'Formats' tab in strongSystem Preferences → Language&amp;Text/strong   Or, it might be quicker to just change the time display of the clock to 24-hours mode: strongSystem Preferences → Date &amp; Time/strong   (I have OS X 10.7.5, so it may be organised/worded slightly differently in newer OS X versions.)
