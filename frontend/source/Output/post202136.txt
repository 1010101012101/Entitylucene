Move library existing Itunes library to Apple Music <body> I deleted my local iTunes Library since I assumed I could listen to the music anyway using Apple Music. After deleting my music files by emptying codehome/music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Music/code I have three types of tracks, based on the column codeiCloud download/code:  ul liFiles with this icon img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yY85n.png" alt="cloud with downward pointing arrow": I can play them without problem./li liFiles with this icon img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/scJcf.png" alt="cloud with diagonal slash": These won't play, which is expected, I have already accepted that these tracks will have to be added manually. /li liFiles without an icon: If I try to play those I this popup img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YWTiZ.png" alt="The song &quot;could not be used because the original file could not be found. Would you like to locate it&quot;" and the exclamation mark is added in front of the title of the track. If I choose codeLocate/code I get a Finder window and the option to point Apple Music towards the local file, which is expected. However, and here is the rub, if I choose codeCancel/code the song plays, the exclamation mark disappears and this img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yY85n.png" alt="cloud with downward pointing arrow" icon  appears after the title of the song. Which is unexpected but nice./li /ul  I'd have to execute the steps under 'Files without an icon' about 6000 times to be able to play most of my tracks again.  <answer202150> After a lot of trial and error and messing about with Apple script the solution turned out to be deceptively simple: Select all songs in your library and in the context menu and choose the option coderemove download/code.
