24" imac from 2008 as a monitor for macbook pro <body> The iMac does only have a mini displayport output. And it does it not have target mode, but if I upgrade my iMac's OS to X Yosemite, will target mode come with it? If so, Will I at that point be able to use thunderbolt-connection or something to get my iMac to work as a second monitor for my macbook pro?  <answer202871> I'm afraid not.br It is hardware-dependent, not software.  The earliest model to support Target Display Mode was the Late 2009 iMac.  See : Use your iMac as a display with Target Display Mode
