Why don't I have the "on this device" button, and how can I get it? <body> Using an iPhone 4 (not 4S), running software v. 6.1, running itunes 10.6.3.25. I'd rather not sync my library, and want merely to see what's already on the phone before adding to it.  I even tracked down an official guide explaining where the button should be, and it simply isn't.  http://support.apple.com/kb/PH12313  I just want to manually manage the media on my iPhone--a reasonable enough request--and, like every interaction I've ever had with iTunes, I am left frustrated and in the dark.
