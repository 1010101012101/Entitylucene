Would signing out of iCloud delete my locally stored photos? <body> I am trying to sign into my iCloud on my iPhone 6 and even with the correct password it is not letting me through but keeps asking with a prompt. I have local photos that I do not want deleted and need to pull off the device. If I were to sign out of my iCloud account will it delete the photos that are stored locally?   <answer266055> This pictures would be deleted:  ul liShared albums that you are invited to –but do not own/li liLocal low resolution pictures that have a full resolution copy on iCloud –when iCloud Photo Library is on, and Optimize [device] storage is on/li liMy Photo Stream Pictures that were not taken by the device, even if copied to the All Photos album/li /ul  Other than this, your local pictures shouldn't be affected.
