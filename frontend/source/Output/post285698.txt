WebP support on macOS — is it indended to actually work? <body> macOS seems to recognize WebP images as such, and seems like it actually tries to display previews of them, but always fails.    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xGGdW.png" alt="screen1"  They are also associated with Preview application, just like other image formats, but Preview also chokes on it (without any error messages, it just silently fails to open a window).  Does it mean that it's intended to actually work but it fails just on my system for some reason?  In my case, the WebP images are lossless and not animated.  <answer285699> strongPreview cannot open webp./strong  For full details on what Preview can open can be found here  To view webp files, you need to download the framework from Google  <comment360389>  'Files are not associated with the "Preview" application. They are associated with their respective applications that can open/edit them.' — this contradicts the fact that when I try to open them, Preview is launched. (to be honest, I don't remember if I manually did set it up that way, but I doubt I did) <comment360390> So, when you have Photoshop installed, what opens it?  Preview or Photoshop?  When PS is installed can Preview still open it? <comment360391> I can't try this because I don't want to spend money on Photoshop license nor do I trust it. I can try with GIMP though. But I don't see how installed GIMP would magically help Preview to understand files which it can't understand now. <comment360393> PS was an example - regardless.  Preview has no ability to view webp.
