Restore iCloud Photo Library <body> This is a little complicated.  I turned off iCloud Photo Library (for reasons that are unimportant) and the dialog that says "Photos will be removed from your phone, but will remain on iCloud" popped up and I hit "OK".  So 4000 photos were removed from my phone because they were all stored to iCloud.  The 1000 remaining photos that were NOT on iCloud are still on my phone.    Then I turned iCloud Photo Library back on, thinking all the 'removed' photos would reappear in my Photos App, but they didn't, and I don't know what to do.  I verified that all 4000 of the photos are on iCloud by logging into the web interface on my desktop, I just can't get them to show back up in my Photos App on my phone.  Thanks,  -loren  <comment301061> Is your phone connected to wifi, or cellular data only?
