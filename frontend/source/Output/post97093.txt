Keynote - playing slide - three finger swipe won't switch applications <body> When I'm in the middle of a keynote presentation playing - the three finger swipe to switch applications no longer works. When I exit playing the presentation - it works again. I run Keynote '09 on OS X Lion.  Is there a way to make three finger swipe work in the middle of a presentation without stopping and starting it?  <answer143115> Three finger swipe won't work in Keynote 2013.   There is quite a complicated way to exit and flip applications here.   There is a simple way to flip to the last used application by pressing H.
