How can I stop Microsoft Word from switching to another space when last window in current space is closed <body> If I close the last window of Microsoft Word on Desktop 1, and there is an open Microsoft Word window on Desktop 2, I am automatically swooshed over to Desktop 2. This behavior does not occur for other apps like Safari or Finder. How can I disable this automatic space swooshing for Microsoft Word?  <comment307772> Try going to system preferences, mission control and uncheck "When switching to an application, switch to a Space with open windows for the application" <comment307773> Tried that. The behavior persists. Any other ideas? <comment307775> if I had my Mac with me right now . most I can say is look in all of Word's settings by clicking the bolded "word" on the top menu bar and seeing if there are any preferences. <comment307779> Good suggestion. But, not seeing anything relevant there. <comment307782> Well I'm going to resort to eccentric ideas. Duplicate the word app and open the files in separate apps. So you could have a word app for space 1, one for space 2 and etc. try this if no one else can figure out an official solution. <comment307783> Definitely an outside the box idea and appreciated, but that would probably require more cognitive effort and consternation than the original issue for me. Thanks for the help, though.
