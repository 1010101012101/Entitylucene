Can't make new partition due to error "volume Macintosh HD was found corrupt and needs to be repaired" <body> When I run Disk Utility on my 2012 MBP (SSD, running El Capitan) I sometimes get the error:   precode  The volume Macintosh HD was found corrupt and needs to be repaired.  /code/pre  Other times, I get no errors.  When I try and create a new partition it fails. Disk Utility just says it failed. But when I run in the Terminal  precode   diskutil verifyVolume / /code/pre  I always get this:  precode ...  Incorrect number of file hard links  Checking catalog hierarchy  File system check exit code is 8  Error: -69845: File system verify or repair failed  Underlying error: 8: POSIX reports: Exec format error /code/pre  When I try running in the terminal:  precode diskutil repairVolume / /code/pre  I get:  precode Error starting file system repair for disk1   Macintosh HD: Unable to unmount volume for repair (-69673) /code/pre  Next, I booted into Recovery mode and ran Disk Utility. The problem is that it doesn't detect any errors so it doesn't try to do any repairs.   <comment272190> You won't be able to unmount it while booted into Mac, do to the fact that the OS is being loaded off of it. In the terminal in Recovery Mode, try running `diskutil repairVolume /Volumes/Macintosh*` <comment272320> @FlareCat I booted into Recovery mode. Ran the above code and it said it couldn't find it, so I tried running    "diskutil repairVolume /Volumes" and it ran and said there were no problems. However, when I ran "diskutil repairVolume /", I got  the error message: "Unable to unmount volume for repair (-69673)". When I try to make a partition (out of recovery mode), I'm getting the same error message. <comment272335> I would then suggest doing a wipe then, if you are OK with that.
