Moving iPhoto to external drive on a MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Mid 2014) with 8 GB 1600 MHz DDR3 <body> I bought a Seagate external HD 500gb with my Mac. Recently started using Photoshop and Lightroom, which take up a ton of space. I was thinking of moving my entire iPhoto to the Seagate to free up space. Is this possible? If so, how would I go about it?     <answer169026> iPhoto was built with this sort of flexibility in mind: it is possible and in fact iPhoto makes it quite easy.   ol liFind your iPhoto library. You'll most likely find it in your codePictures/code folder. If it's not there, open iPhoto while holding the codeoption/code key, and you should get a window similar to the one below. The path to your library is displayed under the library selection box./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/enahM.png" alt="iPhoto library selection window"  ol start="2" liMove your library to the external hard drive. /li liOpen iPhoto with the codeoption/code key pressed to open the library selection window I talked about in Step 1. Hit the codeOther Library.../code button, and find the library on your external hard drive. Pretty easy!/li /ol  Protips:   ul liThe last library you opened becomes your "default" library. That's the one iPhoto opens automatically when you don't press codeoption/code. If that library isn't available, say your external HDD is not connected, the library selection window will open automatically and list the libraries it can find. /li liI keep a library in my computer, but every year or so, when it gets too full, I move it to an external hard disk. You can have as many libraries as you want! Pretty useful if you don't feel like having a single massive package./li liiPhoto supports Apperture libraries, as you can see from my screenshot. d: /li /ul  Let me know if you have any further questions!   <comment198419> Did you do a [search](http://apple.stackexchange.com/search?q=iPhoto+move+external) before posting a new question?
