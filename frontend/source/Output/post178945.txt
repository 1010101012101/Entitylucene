Anything in Mac OS to interfere with using a disk through a USB hub? <body> Have Modbook Pro with OS 10.10.2 and a powered seven-port USB hub.  A 750-GB bus-powered drive has no problems with the hub in-between.  But a powered drive with three partitions, one of them a Time Machine partition, always gets a failure in backup.  Works fine when the hub is not between.  <answer178976> I have 4 USB 3 drives plugged into my MBP via a powered USB 3 hub and two of them have multiple partitions and different filesystems and all work just fine however the Modbook Pro does not yet support OS X 10.10, so that may be an issue.  From Modbook Support Center:     YOSEMITE UPDATE      OS X Yosemite Not Currently Supported on the Modbook Pro The newest   version of the OS X operating system, Yosemite (OS X 10.10), is not   fully supported on the Modbook Pro.      We do not recommend upgrading your Modbook Pro to Yosemite at this   time. (Both OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion and 10.9 Mavericks are supported   on the Modbook Pro.)      An update to the Modbook Pro System Software and the Modbook Pro Pen   Tablet Software offering compatibility with Yosemite and other   features will be available in the near future. Check back here   occasionally for updates.   <comment212041> I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because this is about running OS X on non-Apple hardware. <comment212052> A Modbook is modified Apple hardware, so it's on-topic here. <comment212054> Have you tried a different hub? Does the drive work as expected otherwise? <comment212990> That warning merely refers to their incompetence in supporting the digitizer.  They should not have any effect on disk drives.  Although, the digitizer does use the other USB port â€¦
