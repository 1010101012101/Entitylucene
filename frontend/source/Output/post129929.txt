Automating ffmpeg using Automator Service <body> I often use strongffmpeg/strong off the command line to convert video files into emmp4/em on my Mac (running Mavericks). Do note, however, that I am NOT re-encoding my videos; am just changing the container from an emavi/em or an emmkv/em to an emmp4/em. The exact command I run on Terminal is as follows:  strong/Users/Amit/Documents/Scripts/ffmpeg -i /input.mkv -c:v copy -c:a copy /output.mp4/strong  As can be seen, this involves a lot of typing (for example, the entire path for ffmpeg and the source and target videos) and since I do a lot of such conversions, it would be great to have some Automator help here.  So, how can one go about creating a Finder Service that automates this activity? I would prefer a Finder Service instead of a standalone app or menu item.  <answer129931> h2Automator Service/h2  You can use Automator to create a new service or droplet:  ol liLaunch Automator.app/li liCreate a new service with service receives strongfiles or folders/strong in strongany application/strong/li liAdd a strongRun Shell Script/strong action/li liSet strongPass input:/strong to strongas arguments/strong/li liWithin the script, replace codeecho/code with the script below./li liSave your workflow as a service./li /ol  h2Shell Script/h2  precodefor f in "$@" do     /Users/Amit/Documents/Scripts/ffmpeg -i "$f" -c:v copy -c:a copy "${f%.*}.mp4" done /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2uhDG.png" alt="Automator ffmpeg"  To learn more about using Automator, see Apple's Mac Basics: Automator.  <answer129938> You could also add a function like this to a shell configuration file like code~/.bash_profile/code:  precodemp4() {   for f; do     ffmpeg -i "$f" -c copy "${f%.*}.mp4"   done } /code/pre  Then you can just run codemp4 input.mkv/code.  You can replace code/Users/Amit/Documents/Scripts/ffmpeg/code with just codeffmpeg/code if you move codeffmpeg/code somewhere like code/usr/bin/code or if you add codePATH=~/Documents/Scripts:$PATH/code to code~/.bash_profile/code.  <comment152167> Thank you for your help. I did exactly as you suggest but it does nothing. I do have the service available on Finder as intended but when I select an mkv file and run the service, it does nothing. :( <comment152172> Never mind, I figured it out. Just replaced "$fbname" with "${f%.*}.mp4" as suggested by Lauri Ranta. Damn, I wish I could accept both answers because both were equally helpful to my workaround!
