Can I disable iMessage on an a computer I no longer have access <body> I recently left my ex, he still has access to my iMessages on the Mac we shared. How can I remotely disable his access to my messages?  <answer198521> All you have to do is to change your Apple ID password.   <comment237552> @JaimeSantaCruz Thanks for the comment. Feel free to update the answer. However, I am not 100% sure if this is the case. Last time I changed the password all messages disappeared. Physically they will probably remain on the Mac.
