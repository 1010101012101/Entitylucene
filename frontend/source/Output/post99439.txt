How can I reject sync changes for my OS X Contacts? <body> I have my OS X Mountain Lion contacts hooked up to synchronize with Google Contacts. Every once in a while, I receive a notice that "codeSyncing with Google Contacts will change more than 25% of your contacts or groups on this computer./code"  Almost always, this just means that the images are mysteriously being removed from my contacts. My only two options are "Sync Later" or "Sync Contacts". I would prefer to mark my local contacts as master contacts, or to be able to reject the proposed changes. How can I do this? (Short of manually and laboriously exporting my local contacts and uploading them to Google Contacts every time it has a few changes I don't like).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rcWlG.png" alt="OS X Contacts syncing with Google Contacts and unwantedly removing images"
