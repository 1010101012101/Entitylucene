Can't find "floating or inline" option for images in Pages documents <body> In earlier versions of Pages, there was an option to make an image float on the page. I loved that and can't find it in the new Pages.  Can anyone tell me how to navigate to it?   <answer146346> If you mean where Text will wrap around the image.  h2img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jm3vT.png" alt="enter image description here"/h2  move below and above the image  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AdPEC.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  or the image will float on top of the Text. (inline)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZXWET.png" alt="enter image description here"  Then it is under the Fomat inspector --Arrange tab, --Stay on Page tab - Text Wrap.  The stronginline with Text/strong option   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JNens.png" alt="Old menu"  seems to have been change to strongnone/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bNOcC.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment172444> What do you mean by float? <comment179188> I have the same issue, in the old version it let you make an item 'float' as in make the image transparent, so the image was behind the text, so you could read the writing on top of an image, but the floating option has gone, I'm stuck also <comment265205> Is there a way to specify a default? I asked about this in more detail in: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/219295/osx-paste-images-as-inline-by-default-in-pages-5-x
