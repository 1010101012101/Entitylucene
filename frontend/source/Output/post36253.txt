Showing iMovie clip in keynote on iPod touch <body> I frequently show brief clips of movies in my keynotes when I lecture.  I recently bought an ipod touch to use (so I wouldn't have to schlep my laptop).    strongThe iPad had no trouble with the keynote except when it came to the movie clip.  Is there a fix for this?/strong  [Note, when I download the clip to the iPod touch from my iDisk I got a message that it couldn't process all the slides.]
