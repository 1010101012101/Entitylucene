How do I set the window minimize and maximize speed without using the shift-key <body> I would like to setup my computer (Macbook running snow leopard) so that it will maximize and minimize the windows slowly. I know that this can be done by holding on the shift key while minimizing but can I set it as default so that I don't have to hold the shift key down?  <answer44622> You can do so by using the Applescript below. You'll need CornerClick and you can find more info on MacWorld.  precodetell application "System Events"   keystroke "m" using command down   key down shift   delay 0.3   key up shift end tell  tell application "System Events"   set proc to name of the first process whose frontmost is true   tell process proc     -- add error trapping here     tell its window 1       set w to its name       if get value of attribute "AXMinimized" is false then         tell application "System Events"           keystroke "m" using command down           key down shift           delay 0.3           key up shift         end tell       end if     end tell     --   end tell end tell  say "Collapse" using "Alex" /code/pre  <answer61214> h2Moom/h2     Moom allows you to easily move and zoom windows—on one display, or to another display—using either the mouse or the keyboard.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NQcAo.jpg" alt="Moom Screenshot"  <comment55725> Is it possible to do this without cornerclick, that is if you click on minimize it will evoke the slow animation effect? <comment55726> If you want the slow effect, you can hit the shift button while minimizing the window <comment55727> Michiel, yes. But I want to know if I can set it as default so I don't have to use the shift key. Is that possible as an applescript or setting some defaults through terminal? <comment55731> Not that I'm aware of. But why would you nee such an time- and RAM absorbing process? <comment55738> I find all those zipping windows actually increases my informational anxiety :-) <comment60215> Why do you want to do this? You'll probably get tired of the animation pretty soon... <comment71999> Moom looks very interesting. A bit like the Aerosnap on Window 7. Although I am still looking for slower transitions despite Mountain Lion has made a lot of moving around much smoother in process. I thought there would be some animation speed variable that I could just change. <comment111397> I'm curious to know why you'd want this, too. <comment111750> Reducing information anxiety. When computer do things faster than I can think, it can get out of control. This helps to slow it down a little. For what I do in creatives, efficiency isn't always a top criteria.
