Any way to recover Yosemite download from AppStore? <body> When I opened the folder of previously paid-for apps on the AppStore in order to download Yosemite, I inadvertently clicked the "X" mark next to the "Download" button. This removed Yosemite from the list. Any way to get it back?  <answer242779> From what I can tell, no.  You can find someone with an Apple ID who has downloaded it though, sign in with their credentials, and redownload it that.  <answer242784> In the App Store, Store = View my Account, In the Account Information window, the item Hidden Items = Hidden Purchases: Unhide any hidden, redownloadable Purchases.  Click Manage, You'll see a list hidden purchases which you can UNHIDE.  <comment298753> Thanks! By going into my account on the AppStore, I was indeed able to unhide the app, then download it. <comment298762> While checking the answer I was surprised at the number of things I have hidden.
