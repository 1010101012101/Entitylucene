I saved my iOS 5 SHSH with TinyUmbrella, and now I have 4.1 SHSH too? <body> I launched "Save SHSH" from TinyUmbrella (for the first time ever), and now in Saved SHSHs for iPod Touch list i get iPod 3G 4.1  Does this mean I can downgrade to iOS 4.1? How is this possible, I never saved SHSHs before?  <answer42733> Here's a helpful guide on using TinyUmbrella, SHSH blobs, and downgrading. Depending on your hardware, downgrading may or may not be possible. I haven't tried downgrading anything since iOS 5 beta on original iPad and iPhone 4. It worked in both cases, but I'm not sure what you have.   The version of iTunes may also play a role in your ability to downgrade. For instance, the latest iTunes may not allow you to restore a version of iOS prior to 5.  Sorry if this wasn't as solid an answer you were searching for. Maybe it'll give you a starting point to experiment, if you have the time though.  <comment48612> that's not true. I downgrade to ios 4.3 at the moment. <comment48613> I was able to get iOS 4.3. Dunno how this is possibile. I got no errors. Lucky me? I will stick to 4.3 because it's 50% faster then ios 5 <comment48614> Cool. Congrats lol <comment48660> Yep, you are right: http://www.ijailbreak.com/how-to-downgrade/ removed my erroneous statement. Thanks for clarifying. I appreciate it.
