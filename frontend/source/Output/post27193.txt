ffmpeg giving error on launch in Mac OS X Lion 10.7.1 <body> I installed ffmpeg 0.8.5 in my Mac OS X Lion 10.7.1 with Homebrew  precodebrew install --use-gcc ffmpeg /code/pre  It installed without any error. But, now when I run, it gives the following -  precodedyld: Library not loaded: /usr/local/Cellar/ffmpeg/0.8.5/lib/libavdevice.dylib   Referenced from: /usr/local/bin/ffmpeg   Reason: Incompatible library version: ffmpeg requires version 53.0.0 or later, but libavdevice.dylib provides version 52.0.0 Trace/BPT trap: 5 /code/pre  <answer27197> Try using:  precode$ brew update &amp;&amp; brew install `brew outdated` &amp;&amp; brew cleanup /code/pre  This script will also help you track down changes on libraries that are needed.  If you those don't work try:  precode$ brew doctor (check your setup for common problems) $ brew missing (to check installed packages for missing deps) /code/pre  brew doctor checks your setup for common problems, brew missing checks installed packages for missing deps.  You can always start fresh (which should take care of all the problems):  precode$ brew uninstall --force `brew deps ffmpeg` $ brew install ffmpeg /code/pre  then  precode$ brew update /code/pre  <answer156757> I ran:  codebrew install libav/code  then after it complained about symlinking: codebrew link --overwrite avconv/code  Works now.  <comment31159> Didn't work for me :( but still thanks for your effort :) <comment31168> I've added a couple more solutions to try, <comment191417> `brew uninstall --force `brew deps ffmpeg`` & reinstalling did the trick for me, though it also uninstalled git and the reinstall didn't.
