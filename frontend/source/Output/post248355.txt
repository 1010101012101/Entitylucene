Why won't my Macbook switch audio back to its internal speaker? <body> If I plug in my headset or remove it, then sometimes I have to go to Preferences  Sound and change the output manually or if I remember correctly simply going to that screen and not doing anything would fix it  Is there any fix for this?  I am using MacbookPro 2015 (El Capitan) and this happens when I connect a USB Logitech headphone  <comment307674> We are going to need a little bit more info.  What type of headset (USB or analog) are you using?  Which MacBook?  Which version of OS X? <comment307675> @Allan I made edits <comment307692> Do you have any other USB audio devices?  I happened to have a Logitech headset  and tested this and it worked correctly.  Do you have certain apps that you specify a certain audio device instead of *Default*? <comment307698> @Allan not that I know of, I am somewhat computer savvy. This also happened when I connected an hdmi cable... <comment307699> Ahhh....HDMI also has an audio interface.  Do you have both of them connected at the same time?  Is it (USB headset) connected when the MB goes to sleep by any chance?  I had an issue where if my USB audio interface lost power for whatever reason, I had to go into Preferences to change audio devices back to the Internal speaker. <comment307700> @Allan Don't think I did them at the same time
