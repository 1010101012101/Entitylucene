This will give you the option to reinstall Mac OS X, and you won't have to erase your disk to do it unless the disk is already damaged/corrupted.  <comment307689> Hy again SegNerd i tried your idea but when i want to select my disk and install it again it show me this message: This disk cannot be configured to boot your computer <comment307794> Have you tried running Disk Utility on it? How is the disk formatted?
