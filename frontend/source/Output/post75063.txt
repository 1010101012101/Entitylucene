How to turn on Youtube Subtitles in AppleTV? <body> The youtube video is subtitled, how can I turn it on on my Apple TV?  I tried configuring languages and closed caption, but didn't work.  <answer81530> The Apple TV doesn't support YouTube closed captioning. The closed captioning you've enabled is where video files have subtitles. The same functionality was missing on the pre-iOS 6 YouTube app, so I'm not surprised that it doesn't exist on the Apple TV.  If you want to submit feedback to Apple about this, you can do so here.  <comment94882> Thanks, I submited the feedback to Apple.
