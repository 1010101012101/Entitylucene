Can a Mac Mini use a MacBook Air CD SuperDrive? <body> Will a MacBook Air SuperDrive work with a new Mac mini?   The Apple website says it will work with Mac Mini on Snow Leopard server. No mention of New mac mini and OSX Lion.  <answer35555> Only if it doesn't have a built in optical drive. I think the limitation is built into the drive not the OS and as far as my searches have discovered can only be subverted by hardware hacks of the drive.  It's a bummer as it is is a neat little drive and Apple built-in slot loading drives are not that reliable (4 out of 5 of mine have failed over nearly a decade.) On the other hand there are a lot of cheap and ugly 3rd party alternatives which work fine.
