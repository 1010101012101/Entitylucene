Ethernet, WLAN (Wi-Fi) and Siri <body> Today I updated to macOS Sierra. Until now I disabled WLAN, because my Mac is connected via Ethernet (cable). However, Siri needs WLAN to determine where I am. Thus without WLAN, Siri cannot answer my questions e.g. about the weather. So I enabled it again.  Now my Mac is also connected via WLAN. Does this mean, net traffic now goes over the air though the Mac is connected via Ethernet? (I wouldnâ€™t like that.)  <answer257234> No, not necessarily. The priority given by your Mac to the various connections are determined by the order of services listed in your Network settings. To view this:  ul liGo to System Preferences  Network:/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ut4tl.png" alt="enter image description here"  If your Ethernet connection is not listed above your Wi-Fi connection, you can change the order as follows:  ol liClick on the Cog/Gear icon (on the right of the minus '-' sign at bottom left)/li liSelect strongSet Service Order.../strong/li liIn the Service Order window that appears, click and drag the Ethernet connection so it is at the top (or at least above your Wi-Fi connection)/li liClick OK/li liExit System Preferences/li /ol  As an aside, Siri just needs to be able to access the Internet to work, it doesn't specifically require a WLAN connection to work. If you can't get it to work on Ethernet, then perhaps you should post another question about that.  <comment321117> You should add the "Default Gateway" thingy. If the most prioritized interface doesn't have a router listed the second is in charge (or the 3rd, 4th etc respectively) connecting to the WAN! <comment321156> Without WLAN Siri says she does not know where I am. Thus no weather info.
