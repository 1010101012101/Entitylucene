Macbook not showing Safari tabs from mobile devices <body> I use a Macbook Air, iPhone, and iPad. Why aren't my open tabs in Safari on my iPhone not showing up on Safari on the Macbook?  <comment278536> More information may help, such as: are all devices signed into the same iCloud account, is Safari syncing enabled on the devices, what iOS/OS X versions, etc. <comment278625> All accounts are signed into the same iCloud account and using the same wireless connection.
