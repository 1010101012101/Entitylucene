AppleScript in Distiller <body> I found a simple script to run Adobe Distiller on some file.  precodeon run argv     with timeout of (8 * 60) seconds         tell application "Acrobat Distiller"             Distill sourcePath item 1 of argv         end tell     end timeout end run /code/pre  How can I change page size inside this script?  Or should I modify codex.joboptions/code file and ask Distiller to reload it? How can I do it?  I'm new to AppleScript, and the documentation for Distiller API is not enough for me.  <answer251594> The right answer is probably this:  precodeDistill sourcePath in_file destinationPath out_file adobePDFSettingsPath opt_file /code/pre  And the paths have to be absolute, not relative.
