Cannot access Recovery Mode on Mac OS X <body> I am using a model A1278 Mac and I need to reinstall the OS on it, or reset it. I am attempting to open the recovery mode by using the Cmd + R method but that did not work, I then attempted to use the Option method. That too did not work.  I am out of options and very, very inexperienced in the Mac OS, thus any assistance would be greatly appreciated.  Unsure on the OS X version I am using.  Thanks  <answer204386> The original A1278 MacBook Pro unibody was shipped with Mac OS X 10.5.5 (Leopard).
