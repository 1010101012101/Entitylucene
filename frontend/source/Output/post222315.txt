How to set my real name and address of Pages templates? <body> Pages always uses "Urna Semper" as the name in my templates. Can I set this somewhere to use my own name and address? It's a bit annoying to change all the time.  <answer222316> It depends on your template you are trying to create. You can add your name and address to the document headers and footers. Move the coursor over the top or bottom of the page until you see the header or footer area, then enter your name/address.
