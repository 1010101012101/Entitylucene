Connector for the various part of the MacBook <body> What type of connector used to connect the various parts Apple MacBook? The connector of which I speak is like this:img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nLLnH.png" alt="enter image description here"  This type of connector is used only by Apple or other companies are using? It is their patent?  <answer255608> These connectors are not given a particular generic name by Apple beyond just "cable connector". In their service manuals, the cable connectors are differentiated by referring to what they're connecting. For example, here is a quote from one of their service manuals:     Disconnect the strongbattery cable connector/strong from the logic board, taking   care to keep the cable connector flat when pulling it out of its mate.   Use your thumb on top and a black stick beneath to prevent too much   bend in the cable. An alternative is to use your index fingers (and   nails) to grab the sides of the connector and pull straight out, level   with the board.   strongNOTE:/strong Bold emphasis added by me.  So, these cable connectors are referred to as various names, such as:  ul liBattery cable connector/li liAudio cable connector/li liMicrophone cable connector/li /ul  strongOften these cables are known as Halogen-free cables and connectors. These cables/connectors are delicate and you must handle them with care to avoid damage./strong  Also, since the image in your question isn't labelled, I should point out that there are also various other cables/connectors in a MacBook, such as:  ul liLVDS cable/li liPort hatch flex connector/li liHard drive flex cable/li /ul  And the list goes on.  Hope this helps and answers your question. If not, feel free to comment and clarify what you were after.
