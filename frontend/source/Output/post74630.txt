not resolve local domins from /etc/hosts <body> Somehow I have a problem (previously everything was ok), hosts form /etc/hosts can't bre resolved.  I have local domain in /etc/hosts, like  precode127.0.0.1 test.local /code/pre  It's loading in browser well but too long, from firebug i see that biggest part of time spending for DNS lookup.  I tried codenslookup test.local/code  I see  precode$ nslookup test.local ;; connection timed out; no servers could be reached     /code/pre  but ping codetest.local/code working well :)  my DNS settings are next:  precode$ cat /etc/resolv.conf  nameserver 192.168.1.1 /code/pre  I did not modified that file manually, it just represent GUI settings situation.  precode    $ scutil --dns     DNS configuration      resolver #1     nameserver[0] : 192.168.1.1     reach    : Reachable,Directly Reachable Address /code/pre  Everything become solved if I turn OFF mac os included firewall. How I can make local pages opening faster and keep firewall turning ON ?  <comment341932> We are experiencing this issues since Sierra (we = several machines). Everytime we enter a certain network with assigned DNS via router hosts file is ignored. Simple solution: Switch DNS provider on router. But this is necessary every morning :-( WTF? After this it resolves again against local hosts file.
