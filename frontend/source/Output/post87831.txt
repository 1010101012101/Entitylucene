MacBook Pro Sluggish boot <body> My MacBookPro has been extremely slow at the startup. Is there something similar to Window's System Registry that I can see all the boot files and uncheck what I don't need?

I had a bad experience with it before).  <comment102747> First boot in verbose mode and see what takes time - also what are you measuring the time to - getting the window to enter user name and password or until the users's programs have started
