How to search Mac OS X Mail by List-Id? <body> I would really like to search based off the header codeList-Id/code but I haven't found a way to do this yet.  When I type codeList-Id: &lt;blah@group.company.com&gt;/code into search, I get no results  <comment237354> What "List-Id", I can not find that in Mac mail. <comment237401> If you hit **Control + Shift + H** to see full headers. If the email is a email following the list-id secification for email, then you will see something like this `List-Id: blah@group.company.com`.
