Why does this Applescript for talking to iTunes fail with timeout for some customers? <body> This script works okay for me and most of my customers, but for a few customers it times out with error -1712; I've no idea why. I've tried increasing timeout, but it makes no difference.  The file code/tmp/itunes_model.txt/code doesn't get created so it doesn't seem to be doing anything.  How can I debug/fix this?  precodewith timeout of 1200 seconds tell application "iTunes"      if (count of every file track of library playlist 1) is equal to 0 then         set thePath to (POSIX file "/tmp/itunes_model.txt")         set fileref to open for access (thePath) with write permission         set eof fileref to 0         close access fileref         return     end if      tell every file track of library playlist 1         script performancekludge             property tracknames : its name             property locs : its location             property persistids : its persistent ID         end script     end tell end tell  set thePath to (POSIX file "/tmp/itunes_model.txt") set fileref to open for access (thePath) with write permission set eof fileref to 0  tell performancekludge     repeat with i from 1 to length of its tracknames         try             set nextline to item i of its tracknames ¬                 &amp; "::" &amp; POSIX path of item i of its locs ¬                 &amp; "::" &amp; item i of its persistids             write nextline &amp; linefeed as «class utf8» to fileref         end try     end repeat end tell close access fileref end timeout /code/pre  Added a try-catch around the error as requested and reran; the first time it was run it actually worked which is interesting, but the second time it failed again gleaning no more useful information.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WmFrn.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer217147> strongIt should something like this:/strong  precodetell application "iTunes"     with timeout of 1200 seconds     ...     end timeout end tell /code/pre  Your codetimeout/code should be inside the codetell/code block instead before/above/outside of it.  It seems as if you might be setting the timeout for the script itself instead of iTunes which has a default timeout of em120 seconds/em (all applications have a default timeout of 2 minutes).  This could be failing for a number of reasons besides normal timeouts, such as if the person just upgraded iTunes, and your script opens it for the first time after it was recently installed, it won't be able to execute normal iTunes functions until after closing out of the splash screen that says "Welcome to iTunes version X - Check out all of the new features!, etc."  Also, it's been awhile since I've worked with AppleScript, so I don't recall whether or not if you tell a system application to do something if it automatically opens or not.  If not, it's possible, you may need to codeTell SystemEvents to open application "ITunes"/code (or whatever the syntax is) -- or you could always use the codedo shellscript/code command to open the application, in which case the actual shell command would be codeopen /Applications/iTunes.app//code -- which you can verify in Terminal.  The error could also be if the iTunes app needs GUI focus for these operations to take place and the application automatically loses focus while the script is being run when another application is opened or the user clicks away or some scenario of that sort, which your script will need to be able to account for.  In cases such as this, you may want to codetell SystemEvents to activate application "iTunes"/code before any important actions take place.  This will cause the iTunes window to regain focus.  It may actually be this same codeSystemEvents/code command (you probably need to check/correct my syntax) that initially opens the application if it is not already open at the time the script is run.  <comment259180> Can you put a try, on error err, display dialog err, end try    into the code to get a report back from them with more data than the error number? <comment259404> could you show me how I dont really know Applescript <comment259487> It's hard to show code in comments. You really can google for examples. Put a line after 'with timeout' that says: "try"  then before 'end timeout', put three lines: "on error err'  'display dialog err'  'end try' <comment259887> I did as you said and got him to run again and it seemed to actually work with no error, which makes little sense. I'll report back when I have more information <comment261049> @jweaks Ive now as you requested, the script actually worked once but now failing as before with no additional info <comment261666> Could you post iTunes and OS X version numbers? <comment263453> ooh if you are right about the timeout that would be great, Ive sent amended script to user to try
