"Swift Programming Language" iBook Not Updating <body> I've recently been researching Swift development as I have grown tired of Objective-C. However, the book I am reading (Apple's official guide) will not update to the latest version on my Mac. It updates fine on my iPhone, but it still has the same version from June that I initially downloaded on my Mac. Is there any way to update it?  I have tried deleting and re-downloading the book, and there is still no update option from the Downloads menu. I tried viewing in the iBooks Storeâ€”there is definitely a new version available. When I have iBooks check for available downloads, it says that I have downloaded all Updates and Purchases. Suggestions?  <answer141196> You should be able to download a fresh copy by right-clicking on the book and selecting codeDelete/code. Then once the delete is complete, right-clicking and choosing codeDownload "The Swift Programming Language"/code.  Alternatively...  All books downloaded through iBooks are stored in the following folder.  code/Users/YOURUSERNAME/Library/Containers/com.apple.BKAgentService/Data/Documents/iBooks/Books/code  On both my Macs the Swift Programming Language book is contained in a folder called code881256329.epub/code. You can confirm this is the same on your Mac by checking the iTunesMetadata.plist file in that folder. You should see the book title towards the end of the file.  Close iBooks and delete this folder.  Then open iBooks again and try to open the book. iBooks will tell you codeThis book can't be found. The original file can't be found./code Then if you try to access the book again, iBooks will download a fresh copy.  <answer156745> Using the terminal:  1.- Go to ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.BKAgentService/Data/Documents/iBooks/  2.- Find out which folder contains the Book and go into  3.- Execute: zip -rqX ~/path/to/store/the/Swift.epub .  <comment166320> Is there any chance you're signed into a different Store account? <comment166321> No, I'm definitely signed in to my own. I checked. <comment166404> You just the old copy. It will download a fresh updated copy. I have tried that and it works. You can check the revision  history at Document Revision History inside the book. <comment166504> Are you certain you have the old version on your Mac? Aside from comparing the content I can't see an easy way to tell which version you have. Locate the **Document Revision History** section of the book. Check the latest update to that section, if it is dated **2014-08-04** then you have the latest version. <comment316538> It has been 3 hours since I start to fix the problem. The above answer didn't help either :(
