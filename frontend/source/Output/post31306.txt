Keyboard shortcut to select all text in a cell in Excel <body> Is there a keyboard shortcut key to select all the text in the current cell in Excel, if you are in the process of editing the cell?   <answer31332> I read this as 2 questions.  Q. Is there a keyboard shortcut key to select all the text in the current cell in Excel?  A. command+c for Mac or control+c for Windows while the cell is selected. Choose a new cell and command+v or control+v to paste.  hr  Q. If you are in the process of editing the cell?  A. It is a two step process, command+a or control+a to select all, then command+c or control+c to copy.  <answer64600> ul li^-U to edit the cell/li li⇧-alt-Home to select all text/li li⇧-alt-Left to select one word to the left/li li⇧-alt-Right to select one word to the right/li li⇧-alt-Down to select from the current location to the end of the line./li /ul  Note that in later versions of Excel, the “Windows” equivalents, made by substituting the alt for control, also work.  <answer71483> When editing a cell, a quick way to select all the contents is to…  ul liplace the cursor at the beginning of contents and hit kbd⇧ shift/kbd + kbdend/kbd/li liplace the cursor at end of contents and hit kbd⇧ shift/kbd + kbdhome/kbd./li /ul  <answer83900> There is no direct way.  Please refer the official page for this.  http://office.microsoft.com/en-001/excel-help/select-cells-and-their-contents-in-a-worksheet-HP005202468.aspx  Use of native methods (go to end, use SHIFT+Arrow keys)... wondering why ^A is not supported there.  MS S**ks sometimes.  <answer98955> Do you want to select all the text, or do you really just want to copy it to the clipboard?  If you want to copy all the text in a cell and don't care if it's selected:  Click on a cell or navigate to it using the keyboard. Do emnot/em double-click or not enter edit mode. Do not try to select anything. If you are already in edit mode for some reason, hit kbdEsc/kbd.  Now just hit kbdCMD/kbd-kbdC/kbd.  <answer112848> The great thing about copying the contents of the cell rather than the cell itself is to grab the contents without any formatting (plain text). It really should have a one-step shortcut, but to my knowledge, it doesn't. Here's my workaround:  Select cell in question, hit any character to replace contents of the cell. Then hit ⌘Z to undo and boom, contents selected without any formatting!  A one-step shortcut workaround will require more effort, but can be achieved with the following Keyboard Maestro macro:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QykTa.png" width="450"  <answer186837> I'm using Windows, and I do this:  ol listrongPress F2/strong to edit the cell. The cursor will be at the end. (Also works by double clicking on the cell with the mouse; press End if the cursor is not at the end.)/li listrongPress Ctrl + Shift + Home/strong. All text from the end to the beginning will be selected./li /ol  Note it doesn't work if you enter the cell by writing on it, you have to edit.  <answer239300> The quickest way I've found is the following: 1) tab/select the cell,  2) hit backspace to delete the contents of the cell 3) type Cntrl+Z to undo delete  When the undo function puts the text back into the cell, all text within that cell is automatically highlighted.  Then you can just type Cntrl+C to copy text only.    I found that I needed to highlight all text in a cell in order to be able to paste it back inside another excel sheet whose cells already had other text that I had to leave intact.    Hope this helps!   <comment35884> What do you want to do by selecting all the cell's text? because when you move between cell by keyboard if you press cmd+c you can copy all the cell content and if start typing it clear ell previous data and insert your new data. <comment35937> Can you confirm that command+a or control+a works for you to select all when editing a cell? It doesn't for me. <comment35938> It's true that it isn't ever really necessary to select all when in the cell, but via reflex I often find myself trying to do it. <comment39344> For some strange reason the first time I hit Cmd+A it didn't select it but I hit it again and it did and then it worked every time after that. Strange. <comment75853> Neither ⌘-A nor ^-A works for me, when trying to edit the contents of a cell in Excel, not even pressing them multiple times as suggested by @drewish. <comment75854> @LorinHochstein I agree, reflexively I find it more intuitive to select and replace the text, rather than delete and replace. <comment116295> Do you really mean keycontrol/key on OSX isn't it keyCmd/key? <comment205493> I'm on Windows and the Home equivalent selects until the beginning of the line if text is wrapped. Is this the case here? <comment205556> @konpsych I believe that is also the case here. Typically I only have one line in my cells though, so it is the same thing for me ;-) <comment215409> so ctrl + a is not sufficient for microshit. <comment220667> This site is talking about OS X, where ctrl+shift+home does not do that. The equivalent in OS X is ⇧⌘←. <comment341027> You're right, it's CMD.  I'll edit my response.
