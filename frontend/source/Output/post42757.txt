Is it possible to share a keyboard physically connected to a Windows 7 PC with an iPad 2? <body> I have an iPad 2 and a Windows 7 notebook.  Is it possible to, without jailbreaking, share the notebook keyboard with the iPad?  Maybe some application installed on Windows could expose keyboard through Bluetooth?  <answer42758> The JUC400 Wormhole switch will do this.  There are a number of other solutions mentioned at How can a keyboard be shared with an iPad?.  <comment48667> Just FYI, there's a Mac app that does this, type2phone. Not too sure if there's any Windows app that does this. <comment48672> love type2phone. <comment48700> I would be great to have a type2phone Windows Alternative...
