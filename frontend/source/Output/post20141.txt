How does MacOSX 10.5 chose between networks with the same SSID? <body> I have a Linksys router with dual-band networking. I set the 5ghz band to WirelessN and the 2.4ghz band to wirelessG. If I set them both to the same SSID, will the Mac automatically chose the faster WirelessN band? Is there a preference I need to set for this?  <answer20142> No - the timing of the beaconing signals and whichever is the strongest SSID in the limited window it looks gets chosen. It's a flip of the coin most times. The N does win out more than the G - but it's not a surefire thing by any stretch.  <comment22303> Doesn't dual-band networking only create one network accessible on two different wave lengths? (5 and 2.4 ghz) <comment22305> @XAleXOwnZX true, but accessing it over N will be faster than over G. <comment22314> I've come to just make a second SSID with the word fast in front of the name and set that to be higher in the precedence. Then the mac seems to shift up much more reliably. <comment22315> correction to my previous comment: <comment22317> Doesn't dual-band networking only create one network accessible on two different wave lengths with the EXACT same specifications on both wave lengths? (5 and 2.4 ghz)
