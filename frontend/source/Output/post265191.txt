How to disable discrete graphics card on Mid 2010 MacBook Pro on El Capitan? <body> I have a Mid-2010 MacBook Pro that suffers from the flawed Nvidia chip. Using gfxCardStatus to force integrate works most of the time, but every once and a while mail.app or a browser content (e.g. FB 360 Videos) will force discrete mode and cause a gpu panic / reboot.  I'm looking for a way to disable the discrete graphics so it always uses integrated.  I found this and tried to follow most of the steps http://www.asyncro.com/2014/03/24/macbook-pro-discreate-graphics-card-issue-fix-updated/  I had to boot into recovery mode first and use csrutil disable to disable the new system protection in El Capitan in order to move files  And assumed I needed to move the GeForce*.* instead of AMD*.*  but the command to rebuild the ktexts cache isn't working in El Capitan  <answer286088> That is neither a permanent solution nor it disables discrete graphics card, you will end up with very slow graphics that make your computer unusable for everyday work.  I answered this other question with the full procedure to permanently disable discrete graphics card on startup.
