How to copy and paste lines in Nano on OSX <body> I would like to copy and paste multiple lines in the command line text editor nano on OSX Mountain Lion 10.8.5  Alt-6 and Ctrl-U do not work as on other platforms.  <answer110804> You may be able to cut multiple lines into a buffer using Ctrl-K, and paste them back in using Ctrl-U.  Note that this does not copy the text onto your OS X clipboard, but uses a buffer inside of codenano/code (or the shell?) to perform the actions.  <answer281582> The problem is that in Mac Terminal, the codealt/code key doesn't work unless you change the Terminal Preferences to enable codeUse Option as Meta key/code. Then codealt+6/code will work properly to codecopy/code.  Another choice is to use the codeESC/code key instead of codealt/code. So do codeESC+6/code.
