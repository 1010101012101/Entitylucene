Creating boot disk for Windows 7 on MacBook Pro <body> strongEDIT: I gave in and burned the DVD from a windows PC and I was able to install Windows on my MacBook Pro with Bootcamp. Sorry, that I don't have a satisfying solution./strong  My goal is to install Windows 7 (32-bit) on my MacBook Pro (late 2007) with Boot Camp. (I'm trying to do all this on Mountain Lion.) I am running into multiple problems creating the disk image for Windows 7. I have an ISO file of the Windows 7 DVD. I am fairly certain, that the ISO image is not corrupted. I downloaded it twice, with the DreamSpark download manager, with the same results.  Initially I tried to create a bootable USB key. The USB key is formatted as Mac OS Extended (HFS+). I opened Disk Utility, went to the restore tab, chose the ISO as source and the USB key as destination. The following errors occurred:  ul liWhen the ISO-image is unmounted: "RESTORE FAILURE Could not validate source - Invalid argument"/li liWhen the ISO-image is mounted: "RESTORE FAILURE Could not validate source - error 254"/li /ul  After repeating this a dozen times, I tried solve the problem from the Terminal as suggested in many forums:  precode$ sudo asr restore -noverify -source /path/to/windows/windows_7.iso -target /Volumes/Untitled/ -erase     Validating target...done     Validating source... Could not validate source - Invalid argument /code/pre  Since this also didn't work, I then tried to burn the image on a DVD. So I went into disk utility, chose the Windows 7 ISO, and chose burn.   I get prompted     Waiting for a disc to be insertedâ€¦   I insert a brand new DVD-R.The drive starts to do something and notifies me     Waiting for the drive.   And then immediately ejects the disk again and prompts me for the a disc.  <answer82026> Try using codedd/code instead of codeasr/code.  ol liUse codemount/code to determine the device path of your attached USB disk.  Find the disk itself and ignore the individual partition numbers.  EG: if you get code/dev/sda1/code just use code/dev/sda/code for the next steps./li liUnmount the disk in the Finder.  /li liConstruct and run your codedd/code command as such: codedd if=/path/to/windows7.iso of=/path/to/usb/device/code/li /ol  <answer91602> The built-in Boot Camp Assistant can create a USB drive if you give it the ISO.  <answer97348> You can never use a mac formatted USB for Windows Use. This guide should help you burning a disc. http://lifehacker.com/251758/mac-tip--how-to-burn-an-iso-or-dmg-file-to-disc. Remember to insert a blank DVD (DVD+R recommended) and make sure it's blank before attempting to burn the ISO. If a message pops up about a blank disc, click do nothing or ignore it.   <comment79121> Try using http://burn-osx.sourceforge.net/Pages/English/home.html and see if you can burn the disc. I personally despise Disk Utility for disc burning. I can't remember a single time that OS X's built-in disc burning subset actually worked properly for me. <comment114190> Answers on Ask Different need to be more than just a link. It's okay to include a link, but please summarize or excerpt it in the answer. The idea is to make the answer stand alone. <comment149067> Note that you need to unmount rather than eject the disk. You can do this from disk utility, right clicking on the partition. <comment222764> it does not even offer that
