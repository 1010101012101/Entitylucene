how to make yosemite run old game? <body> The dance pad game "in the groove" hangs after start in yosemite, it only displays the loading name and hangs, have to use force kill to stop  It worked flawlessly on the last 5 osx versions, and even though it hangs, it is not listed with "program not responding" in the force quit list  A demo of the game showing the same fault can be downloaded here http://download.cnet.com/In-The-Groove/3000-2115_4-10621434.html  From the system log;   "In The Groove[48960]: WARNING: The Gestalt selector gestaltSystemVersion is returning 10.9.1 instead of 10.10.1"  "process In The Groove[48960] thread 1025468 caught burning CPU!; EXC_RESOURCE supressed due to audio playback"  It seems that yosemite updates won't help, would be amazing if anyone have a clue, this is my favorite game and it would be wonderful if it can be fixed!  <comment183179> Is there anything in `/var/log/system.log` which might give a clue about what is wrong? <comment185158> Nov 21 02:09:14 Sol.local In The Groove[48960]: WARNING: The Gestalt selector gestaltSystemVersion is returning 10.9.1 instead of 10.10.1.
