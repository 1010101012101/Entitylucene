Using webcam connected to MacBook inside a Docker container <body> Has anybody figured out yet how to use an external webcam which is connected to a MacBook inside a Docker container?  I read that I have to pass this flag code--device /dev/video0/code to docker run, but I have a MacBook and there is no code/dev/video0/code.  Host Machine: codeMacBook Pro (15-inch, Mid 2012)/codebr External Webcam: codeLogitech C922 Pro Stream/codebr Docker container: codewusuopu/python-opencv3-dlib:py3.5/code  PS: I do not have an iSight camera anymore, I took it out.  <answer277029> According to https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/faqs/#what-is-the-benefit-of-hyperkit this is not possible.
