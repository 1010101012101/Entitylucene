Problem with Time Machine Backup to NAS for one iMac but not another <body> This is a bit of a weird problem. I have two iMacs, both running MacOS Sierra 10.12.5 and both set to back up to A Synology DiskStation NAS. The only difference is that one iMac is a Mid 2011 and the other is a Late 2015.  The Time Machine BackUp works perfectly for the Late 2015 iMac to the NAS, backing up Automatically on an hourly basis, so I am pretty sure that the setup for Time Machine on the NAS is done properly. It is also okay for an MBP that I back up to the same NAS when it is connected to my home network.  However, the Mid 2011 will not back up automatically, even though the box was ticked when the TM backup was first set up. Both iMacs are set to be encrypted backups, so there is no difference between the settings. Also, they are both using SMB to connect to the NAS.   I have tried to delete the backup of the Mid 2011 and redo the initial backup.  I have connected to the NAS using the same shared folder and the same Time Machine User and I have made a new shared folder with a new Time Machine User login, but neither have allowed for automatic backup. I also tried to use AFP, but that has not helped either.  Another thing that I find weird is that for the Late 2015 and MBP a .sparsebundle file is created, where as with the Mid 2011, a folder with a machine generated ID is created, in other words not the iMac Computer name. I am not sure why the is the case. I am wondering if it has to do with the fact that this iMac's name has a pipe (|) in it, and that may be why the .sparsebundle is not created?  Any thoughts on what might be preventing the automatic backup from occurring would be greatly appreciated.
