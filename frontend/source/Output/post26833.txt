How do I publish a link to my iChat account <body> So I have an email signature and web site that links to my email, twitter and linkedin identities, how do I add a link to my iChat account (via google talk server) other than just linking to my google user name (which is of course my gmail address). Thanks.  RIP Steve Jobs.  <answer26836> I believe that these work:  precode&lt;a href="aim:goim?screenname=dori"&gt;AIM&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href="ymsgr:sendIM?dori"&gt;YIM&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href="gtalk:chat?jid=dori"&gt;gTalk&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href="skype:dori?chat"&gt;Skype&lt;/a&gt; /code/pre  Or would, if I had the user account codedori/code on any of those services.  <comment30637> Dori - Thank you ;-)
