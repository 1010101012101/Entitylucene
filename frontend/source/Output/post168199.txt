my ipad is not recognizing a changed network number <body> My husband's PC and iPad both work with the new network, a 2-wire.    Mine iPad won't recognize the new network.    What do I need to do/know to make it work.  <comment197362> questions above what? We would really need a whole more more to go on in order to help. <comment197368> It could be a number of reasons. So please answer following: Is it a 5 GHz network? is it showing in your wifi scan? This is a ATT router! do you have restrictions how many devices can connect? what is your iPad model?
