How do I set seeing events set for different timezones in their home-local time? <body> For travellers, the Timezone Support feature might be a nice one. But it is not, as far I can see.  Let's make an example.  ul liI am away from my home in Prague - I went to a business trip in California./li liI want to set an event for my stay in California, which I do with the local time on my iDevice - i.e.:/li liI set the appointment with the Pacific Time (my Timezone Support is ON set for Pacific Time, which I am in)./li liThen I want to check and edit my appointments when I will have been back home in Prague. But I am seeing them them with the time shift for thE time i am currently living in, so e.g.: I have an event back in Prague at 9 a.m. local time (set in the Calendar for 9 a.m. Central European Time) but I see it now as it was at 0 a.m./li /ul  I understand than when two people from different timezones    have e-conference and they share their calendar, they want to have    the meetings at the same timepoint. But me personally I would like to    see my events for the time it is scheduled for in its timezone. This    could be the second option you could switch on/off in the Settings    for Calendar. I am surprised people who design the great devices and    who usually travel, haven't worked it in.  Anyone who managed to solve this? Living in two different time zones is not easy, I know, but the iDevices were meant to make our living easy, eh? I might only be so confused that I don't see the easy solution. So:  How do I see the events created for different timezones in their local times, everytime I travel and change my timezone automatically on my device?
