Disable swapping on Yosemite <body> Under OS X Mavericks and below we just could codelaunchctl unload/code the dynamic_pager plist, but trying to unload this plist doesn't have any effect since OS X Yosemite.  What is the new way to disable swap files now with OS X Yosemite?  <answer153158> precodesudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.dynamic_pager.plist /code/pre  Tested on freshly installed Yosemite from App Store.  <answer153571> Have you tried something like this?  precode# Check installed RAM, disable VM if 8Gb or more.  mem_inst=`/usr/sbin/sysctl -n hw.memsize`  if [ "$mem_inst" -ge "8589934592" ]; then     echo "8Gb+ Memory installed."         if [ "$action" == "unload" ]; then             sudo nvram boot-args="vm_compressor=2"             sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0             echo "vm.compressor_mode set to 2"         else             sudo nvram boot-args="vm_compressor=4"             sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 3             echo "vm.compressor_mode reset to defaults"         fi             launch_control $action /System/Library/LaunchDaemons com.apple.dynamic_pager     else     echo "Less than 8Gb memory." fi /code/pre  This isn't something I wrote, was information I found.  <answer157018> I used a program called Onyx to disable my swap file. &amp; I have 16GB of RAM.  <answer167169> Here's what I do:  sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0br em(disables hibernation mode)/em  sudo rm -rf /private/var/vm/em./embr *(removes existing swap files)  sudo chflags uchg /private/var/vm/br em(locks down the swapfile directory, prevents anything from being written to the folder)/em  strongAs others have said, though, please only do this if you know what you're doing./strong  <comment180398> Getting `/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.dynamic_pager.plist: Could not find specified service `. Also it doesn't have any effect on whether the system is swapping or not. (yes, I did reboot) <comment180819> I just tried to use `sudo nvram boot-args="vm_compressor=2"`, which might definitely be the correct solution, when looking at http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/118839/97060. I applied that command and rebooted. Will accept if there's still no swap in a few hours, just to verify ;-) (By the way, everything else in this post except that single command are useless commands...) <comment196000> Which basically works too, but isn't the _clean way_. It just writes messages in the log files etc.. Just use `sudo nvram boot-args="vm_compressor=2"` and you're fine. <comment196001> I should have said "Here's what I've done in the past"  Between SSDs and a ton of RAM, I no longer choose to disable swap.  It's more trouble than it's worth. <comment303179> Comments are not for extended discussion; this conversation has been [moved to chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/42453/discussion-on-question-by-bwoebi-disable-swapping-on-yosemite). <comment323613> According to http://wiki.summercode.com/how_to_disable_or_enable_swapping_in_mac_os_x you should do some launchctl thing first? <comment323626> For followers, vm_compressor 2 is VM_PAGER_COMPRESSOR_NO_SWAP and 4 is VM_PAGER_COMPRESSOR_WITH_SWAP (ref: www.apple.stackexchange.com/q/118839/25085). On sierra I get `nvram: Error setting variable - 'boot-args': (iokit/common) general error` unless disabling system integrity protection first, then it works <comment323628> on sierra, requires you to "disable system integrity protection first" FWIW
