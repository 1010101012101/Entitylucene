Scaling resolutions on MBP Late 2013 with 4K monitor <body> I'm connecting my Late 2013 MBP with Iris Pro graphics to a Seiki 39" 4K monitor. emSeemingly at random/em, I get two different types of Settings-Displays screens:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/I6Hpm.png" alt="Screen 1"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SLq3m.png" alt="Screen 2"  Importantly, Screen 2 lets me choose my favorite resolution - a scaled display with effective 2560x1440 pixels. Screen 1 only lets me choose 1920x1080 at HiDPI, which makes screen elements too large. Alt-clicking 'Scaled' on Screen 1 strongdoesn't/strong help. I do get more choices, but not 2560x1440 HiDPI.  How do I always force Screen 2?
