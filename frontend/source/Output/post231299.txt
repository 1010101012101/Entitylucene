Can't control Garageband with Logic Remote <body> I'm running GB 10.0.3 on a Mac Pro with El Capitan. I've installed Logic remote on an iPad 2 with the hope of controlling it (upgrading the tablet to iOS 9.2.1 in the process. Logic Remote is V1.3.  The two apps seem to connect ok (albeit a little slowly), however, the control seems to be only one way. When I hit play on the Macbook for example, the play control lights up on the tablet, but not the other way around.   Is this just a straight out bug, or perhaps is there something I'm missing.   Any suggestions welcomed.   Thanks
