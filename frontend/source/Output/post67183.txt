Can a Keyboard Shortcut be Set to Connect to VPN? <body> I now this may sound quite lazy, but I connect to a VPN several times a day (since the laptop gets disconnected from time to time).  I am aware of the "Show VPN Status in the Menubar" option, but is there a way I can make it a keyboard shortcut?  <answer67190> You could create an AppleScript which would run a shell script to coderacoonctl/code - the specific commands will depend upon your VPN connection.  Then use Script Utility to enable the global Script Menu, then add a new keyboard shortcut in System Preferences  Keyboard  Keyboard Shortcuts, and assign it to the script (or use a launcher utility such as Quicksilver).  <answer238279> ol liOpen the Automator utility and create a new "Service" workflow. . Set the workflow to receive "no input" in "any application" in the top-most menus./li liAdd the "Run AppleScript" action to the workflow, and replace its script contents with the following:  precodetell application "System Events"     tell current location of network preferences         set VPN to "SERVICE NAME"         set VPNactive to connected of current configuration of service VPN         if VPNactive then             disconnect service VPN         else             connect service VPN         end if     end tell end tell /code/pre  Be sure to replace codeSERVICE NAME/code with the name of your VPN connection, which can be looked up in the Network system preferences (if the name is truncated, click the Advanced... button and view the full name at the top of the Advanced Settings panel)./li liSave the workflow with a name like "Connect to VPN"/li liWhen this is finished, go to the Keyboard system preferences and select the Keyboard Shortcuts tab, where you can locate the "Connect to VPN" service in the Services section, and assign a custom keyboard shortcut to it. You should now be able to toggle your VPN connection on and off from within any application by using this shortcut./li /ol  I personally assign `Control + Option + Command + V' to toggle my VPN.

See http://stackoverflow.com/a/38146025/5932012 for an updated bash version. <comment301445> @OliverJosephAsh It actually works with my latest El Capitan beta.
