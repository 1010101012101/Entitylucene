Permission Problems for copied files from NAS <body> I access my Synology NAS via AFP and can open/edit all of my files directly on it. But when I copy a file to my desktop I can't open it. Finder tells me I don't have appropriate permissions.  When I look at the permissions (CMD + I) on …  h3… my NAS:/h3  ul li(unknown): read &amp; write/li lieveryone: no permissions/li /ul  h3… my desktop:/h3  ul listaff: read &amp; write/li lieveryone: no permissions/li /ul  ls -l will print (for both paces): ----rwx---  1 suntrop  staff  35354  4 Jul 10:32 File.docx  Is this a problem on the Mac or Synology or my settings?  <answer66688> Do not connect via AFP: use SMB.  <answer118791> Sounds like a permission problem. I had a similar issue. Files created by one user in two groups (emadministrator/em &amp; emuser/em) on NAS were not being able to read by users only in the emuser/em group. I tried reseting ownership/permissions using File Station from DiskStation and did nothing. I figured something was wrong with root folder permissions on shared folder - and yes, they were owned by root and 777 chmod.  I've managed to fix this by:  ol liOn the Synology - control panel - win/mac/nfs - goto Mac File Serivce (AFP) and turn off Apply default UNIX permissions (Mac file services enabled) - root of your problem/li lilog on to NAS via ssh, go to most root shared folder and do  precodechown -R nobody:users shared_folder/ chmod -R 755 shared_folder/ /code/pre/li /ol  used info from here, here and here.  <answer288677> In my case, I discovered that if I close the folder in the finder there's no problem with permissions. If the folder is open and displayed, then I get the message that I can't save my file due to the fact that I don't have the necessary permissions. Go figure, but it works here every time.   <comment75861> The permissions should ideally be 755, i.e., rwxr-xr-x at both places. <comment75887> Ok, thanks. And what causes the problem or how to avoid it? :-) <comment75888> I don’t know what caused the problem or how to avoid it, but you can probably fix it by running `sudo chmod -R 755 /path/to/drive` in the Terminal. That’s why I didn’t put this as an answer. <comment75966> That's not only this particular file. Almost all files have this problem. anyway, I'll check some other resources and try to fix it. Thanks. <comment75970> No, I did not say `path/to/file`, I said `path/to/drive`. This will fix ALL files on the drive. <comment76123> :-) Sorry I am not familiar with it. Thanks!! <comment76126> You’re welcome. <comment76127> Do you know why it's possible to change the permissions? It seems I don't have them (since I cannot open the files), but can change permissions. Shouldn't permissions prevent it? <comment76136> That’s because you are using `sudo`. This command gives you `superuser` privileges. The superuser can do anything. <comment76283> I can change chmod without sudo – even now, if I haven't logged in as sudo. <comment76294> Well I don’t know how that happened. <comment78551> Why should they connect via SMB instead of AFP? While this might be exactly right, some more explanation would be nice. <comment78727> Although SMB will work it doesn't support some of the OS X features I like. I submitted a bug report to Apple and – I hope – they fix it :-) <comment209362> Synology had to reverse engineer AFP, whereas SMB is open source. That's why SMB is safer to use, especially with newer OS X versions
