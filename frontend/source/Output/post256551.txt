Will OSX Server coordinate parental controls time limits across machines? <body> I have kids with set daily time limits via Parental Controls (e.g. they can only use the computer for 2 hours a day during the week between certain times). At the moment, they have separate accounts on the different Macs in the house and thus inconsistent settings and time limits. If they use up time on one machine, they go to the next and get more.  If I used OSX Server and established their accounts as domain (?) accounts, would the time restrictions be coordinated across the machines? I would naturally assume that they would need to be actively on the network for the synchronization to work, but the idea being that if they use up 1 hour on one machine, they'd only have one hour left on the others as a result.  I haven't purchased or installed Server yet as it hasn't been compelling enough to do so, but not exactly keen on buying it to experiment :-)
