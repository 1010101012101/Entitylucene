Tiled window switcher <body> I'm a big iTerm user with 3 split panes on a 30" monitor. The only issue is that I sometimes want to add a Safari window as the left most pane. I can achieve this by using any of the window sizers out there and setting the window to float on top. However, this means that I have to kbdCommand ⌘/kbd-kbdTab/kbd to get to the Safari window while I kbd⌘/kbd+arrow to switch between the panes.   Is there a program that not only uses a grid for positioning/sizing, but also provides directional navigation between panes?  <answer65764> I found Slate which might fit the bill. I've tried out the following ~/.slate and it does directional focus. Will check back after playing with it before selecting this answer.  precode# Focus Bindings # NOTE: some of these may *not* work if you have not removed the expose/spaces/mission control bindings bind right:cmd    focus right bind left:cmd     focus left bind up:cmd       focus up bind down:cmd     focus down bind up:cmd;alt   focus behind bind down:cmd;alt focus behind /code/pre
