Safe to upgrade to Windows 8 on Bootcamp? <body> So I'd read a strongservice advisory on the Parallels site/strong warning users not to upgrade to Windows 8 due to it damaging their virtual machine and associated files therein.  That being said, is it currently possible/safe to upgrade to Windows 8 from Windows 7 on a Bootcamp installation through typical upgrade means, or are there any notices to hold off on this as well?  <answer69945> Its perfectly safe. You might run into problems with the trackpad driver (i did) but a quick search here was all i needed to fix it.  <comment81218> Outstanding, thank you for the post!
