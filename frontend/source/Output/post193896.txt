How to prevent iTunes 12.2 from automatically uploading sound tracks to iCloud Music Library? <body> I've notice after I updated my iTunes to 12.2 on my OSX 10.10.4 computers, a very large upload bandwidth has been taken place. This is a result of Apple's new iCloud Music Library feature. I don't want to upload my musics to iCloud, and I found no options to prevent iTunes 12.2 from automatically uploading sound tracks to iCloud Music Library.  I also noticed if I use file  library  Update iCloud Music Library, some of my deleted songs will come back to my playlist. I can delete them but once I click file  library  Update iCloud Music Library again, they will reappear in my playlist.  <answer193930> To turn off iCloud Music Library on your mac, you need to go to: iTunesPreferencesiCloud Music Library  <comment235398> Is than an update to this answer since the release of Apple Music? I don't see any options for "iCloud Music Library". <comment238330> @JacobMcLock: Which version of iTunes are you using? In 12.2, the "General" section of the preferences has a checkbox under "Show Apple Music" for "iCloud Music Library (your account email)". <comment244166> You ALSO have to go to, on your iPhone, Settings--Music--Turn off iCloud Music Library, I also turned off "Show Apple Music" for good measure. <comment244167> You also have to turn icloud music library off from your iphone/ipod/ipad aswell as your mac :) <comment244168> If people want to answer a more holistic - how do I manage things with iOS and Mac, please ask a new question to cover that expanded issue. <comment257784> I also don't have the iCloud option on iTunes 12.3.1: http://cl.ly/image/042R0V0y282y
