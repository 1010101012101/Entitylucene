Error installing lxml on Mac Snow Leopard <body> I am getting what seems to be a common error when trying to install lxml on MacOS 10.6:  precodeBuilding lxml version 2.3. Building without Cython. Using build configuration of libxslt 1.1.24 /usr/libexec/gcc/powerpc-apple-darwin10/4.2.1/as: assembler (/usr/bin/../libexec/gcc/darwin/ppc/as or /usr/bin/../local/libexec/gcc/darwin/ppc/as) for architecture ppc not installed Installed assemblers are: /usr/bin/../libexec/gcc/darwin/x86_64/as for architecture x86_64 /usr/bin/../libexec/gcc/darwin/i386/as for architecture i386 src/lxml/lxml.etree.c:161594: fatal error: error writing to -: Broken pipe compilation terminated. lipo: can't open input file: /var/tmp//cc7Ypl70.out (No such file or directory) error: Setup script exited with error: command 'gcc-4.2' failed with exit status 1 /code/pre  I have tried several of the suggestions I could find (setting archflags, linking to gcc-4.0) but still get the same error every time. I have Xcode 4 installed. Any help appreciated.  RESOLVED with: sudo env ARCHFLAGS="-arch i386 -arch x86_64" easy_install lxml  No thanks to the question migration. It was beter suited for StackOverflow.  <answer15678> There is a workaround here: https://bugs.launchpad.net/lxml/+bug/790518     export ARCHFLAGS="-arch i386 -arch x86_64"   <comment16458> Is this a programming question? <comment16459> No, and I flagged for it to be moved. <comment16460> Which python are you using? <comment17157> Well, I'm trying to work with XML in Python. StackOVerflow was more appropriate than a Mac poweruser forum. <comment17158> Thanks. That was close. What finally did it was this: sudo env ARCHFLAGS="-arch i386 -arch x86_64" easy_install lxml
