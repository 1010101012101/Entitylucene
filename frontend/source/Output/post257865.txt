Why Safari 10 bar search is so slow in Mac OS Sierra? <body> It seems that one of the surprises with Safari 10 on Mac OS Sierra is that it takes ages to perform a search using the search bar (using Google as default search engine).  It takes on average even more than 5 seconds to open the new search tab with google results.  I would rule out a system issue because I reinstalled the entire OS from scratch less than a week ago. This issue didn't change at all.  The only extensions that I am using are 1Password, LastPas and 1Blocker.  I tried using the search on private mode and it seems to get the same slow results so it should not be related to extensions.  Can I make it 1 second? On Chrome it works well.  <answer281878> Try selecting from the Menu Bar, Safari/Preferences/Search and deselect "Enable Quick Website Search". That appears to have solved some of my issues, although it can still be slow at times.   <answer283158> Menu Bar - Safari - Preferences - Search  Deselect "Preload Top Hit in the background". It works for me.  <comment322211> Maybe Safari 10, don't make improvement in performance. I quit Safari 10 for Web Dev, after 1 hour it takes 10Gb out of 8Gb im my MB pro. In another MB air without any inspector open toke 5GB out of 4GB. Yeah more RAM that already installed. Moved to Safari Tech Preview.
