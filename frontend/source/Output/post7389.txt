MacBook Pro (6,2 - Mid 2010) Crashes During Graphics Acceleration <body> Ever since upgrading to 10.6.5 my MacBook pro seems to crash when graphic acceleration. The screen will go black and if audio is playing it will start to skip like a broken record.  This occurs when using the following apps:  ul liTransmit/li liSparrow Mail/li liPixelmator/li /ul  and this css3 demo:  ul lihttp://lab.simurai.com/ui/zen-player//li /ul  Anyone else experiencing similar issues?  Hardware is stock and diagnostics are reporting everything is ok.  <answer7398> It sounds like a problem happening when the computer switches to the high-performance (discrete) chipâ€“something in that transition is failing. Open Console from the Utilities folder, and find kernel.log.  See if there are any interesting lines at the time the crash happens.  Probably a few lines with "NVDA" in them.  If you open System Preferences and then Energy Saver, you can adjust the graphics mode - try setting it to high-performance (discrete) all the time.  Either the system will freeze right then, or you can attempt the same tests.  If you still see trouble, it's time to talk to Apple.
