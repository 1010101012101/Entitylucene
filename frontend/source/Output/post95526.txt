editing /private/etc/hosts <body> I just added my no-ip domain to /private/etc/hosts under a shorter alias:  codealias           host.no-ip.biz/code  I tried the following on the shell:  codedscacheutil -flushcache/code  but it still says:  codessh: Could not resolve hostname/code  What up with that?  <answer95527> /etc/hosts can't be used for that:     /etc/hosts cannot be used (by itself) to produce hostname "aliases".      The hosts file produces the internal equivalent of A and PTR records from the DNS, i.e. mapping of hostname to IP address and vice-versa.      It cannot be used to produce the same effect as a CNAME record.   You can make codessh alias/code equivalent to codessh host.no-ip.biz/code or codessh username@host.no-ip.biz/code by adding lines like this to code~/.ssh/config/code:  precodeHost alias HostName host.no-ip.biz # User username /code/pre  <comment112051> downvoted question -- surprise surprise.  great job stack overflow. <comment112052> perfect.  thanks. <comment112076> Some people down vote for too many words, others for too few words, and on a lower traffic site like this, it's possible it will take 4 months to get the views of people who appreciate the question and answer enough to up vote it. <comment112077> @WalrustheCat agreed.
