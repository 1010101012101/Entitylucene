iPhone will not connect to corporate WPA2/Enterprise network <body> Starting today all iPhones on our corporate network are unable to connect to any of the 4 WiFi access points.  I had no issues as of yesterday.  Android devices and laptops have no issues.  IOS versions tested are 8.2 and 8.4.  I have rebooted the authentication/NPS server.  "Forgot the network" on the phone and also went to General, Reset, Reset Network Settings.  Forgetting the network, then reconnecting does not prompt to accept the certificate any longer also.  I have changed the "Dial-in" settings on the user's Active Directory account to Allow Access and the error is still generated below.  I have since switched them back to "Control access through NPS Network Policy" and the settings on the Network Policies has a checkmark for "Ignore user account dial-in properties"  Here are the settings: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AWxtQ.png" alt="enter image description here"  This is the error the server.  precodeNetwork Policy Server denied access to a user.    Contact the Network Policy Server administrator for more information.

Reason Code:            65      Reason:                The Network Access Permission setting in the dial-in properties of the user account in Active Directory is set to Deny access to the user. To change the Network Access Permission setting to either Allow access or Control access through NPS Network Policy, obtain the properties of the user account in Active Directory Users and Computers, click the Dial-in tab, and change Network Access Permission. /code/pre  <answer199815> codeSolution:/code  Create a new RADIUS server for 802.1X wireless of wired connection standard configuration.    Used the same exact settings as the previous connection request policies and network policies.  Deleted the old ones.    <comment240562> Did you notify the company you work for? <comment240573> I am the person I would notify. <comment240621> This might best be asked on Serverfault as this is likely an issue with setting the proper config on your wireless network to allow IOS devices to connect. <comment240631> Ironically I figured out how to fix it...  Just had to re-add a new configuration and delete the old ones.  Same settings...
