How do I ping6 a link local address on OSX? <body> On linux I see all connected IPv6 addresses to my wlan adapter with  precodeping6 ff02::1%wlan0 | head /code/pre  but how can I achieve this on OSX?  <answer105322> That article might be of some help: http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/howto-test-ipv6-network-with-ping6-command/  <answer105323> If you read the MAN page about codeping6/code then it would be:     emThe following will probe hostnames for all nodes on the network link attached to wi0 interface.  The address ff02::1 is named the link-local all-node multicast address, and the packet would reach every node on the network link./em   codeping6 -w ff02::1%wi0/code  https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man8/ping6.8.html  <answer105324> On OSX the wifi device has another name, usually "en1", so this works on OSX:  precodeping6 ff02::1%en1 | head /code/pre  you find out the name with  precodeifconfig /code/pre  and look for a device that has an IP in a line precieding "inet" with an IP that is within your network
