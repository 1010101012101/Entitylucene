Stop users from deleting meeting rooms in Outlook 2010 <body> I'm having a problem with Outlook 2010. It has currently let users delete scheduled rooms that other users have booked. How can I stop this?  <comment119572> Outlook 2010 is a Microsoft product. This being a Mac forum, can you clarify that you're using a Mac product (which would either be Outlook 2008 or 2011)? <comment119585> WE KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT BUT YOU ARE IN THE WRONG CROWD.
