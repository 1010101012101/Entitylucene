Third party USB Ethernet adapter won't wake up <body> I have a mid 2015 Retina MBP 15" and regularly use multi screens and hard wired ethernet. So I've bought a third party HandAcc USB ethernet adapter with Realtek 0x8153 chipset (the device also includes a 3 x USB port hub).  Waking up after sleep the USB hub seems to be working, but the Ethernet has disconnected and won't reconnect without hot (un)plugging. This is particularly annoying if I have hard drives connected to the hub as they will disconnect (seemingly still working after waking).  Has anyone had this or a similar problem and found a decent solution?  <comment261647> Just bumping this to see if anyone has any light to shed. <comment273199> I also have the same problem, but resetting all the preferences (deleting them) and also resetting PRAM did not solve the problem. <comment289071> Also having same issue here - no answers yet. <comment374093> I have similar issue especially when the two USB LAN adaptors in different places (e.g., home and office) have the exactly same device name. I usually disconnect from the USB hub, close the lid of the MBP, move it from/to the home/office, open the lid and log-in, connect the USB hub. Everytime I do this, I have to physically disconnect and re-connect the USB LAN adaptor to make it working. If I use differently named USB LAN adaptors, then everything works fine without physical reconnects.
