iPod generation 4 won't upgrade ios <body> Please help me, my iPod 4 won't upgrade past ios 6.1.6 and this is very annoying as there are many apps that you have to have at least ios 7 or 8 for. Does anyone know how I can upgrade?! Thanks!  <answer233361> You can't update to iOS 9.  According to Apple, it's only compatible with iPod 5th &amp; 6th generation.  Apple stops signing (authorizing) previous iOS versions shortly after the new ones come out.  Because of that, you can't update to iOS 7 or 8 because they're no longer available from Apple.  You might be able to bypass this restriction by jailbreaking your device but I don't recommend that because there's many things that can wrong, including bricking your iPod.  <comment285215> http://ipsw.me Shows which versions are available for each device. <comment285216> Maximum iOS for iPod 4 is 6.1.6 - that's just as far as it can go.
