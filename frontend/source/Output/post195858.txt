I have reset my iPhone, now many contacts are lost, though I synced them through iCloud. Are they still in an old backup? <body> I reset my iPhone 4 because it was terribly slow after 3 years of continuous usage.  Now it's much faster again, but many of my contacts are lost, although I used to sync them using iCloud and I had them both on my phone and on my Mac. I tried to restore them using TimeMachine, but it seems there are no backups for contacts left from early enough.  Now I wonder whether my contacts still are on an old iPhone backup (which I should have in iTunes from before resetting my iPhone) and so I could get them back.  So my question is: What could have happened that I lost most of my contacts? I indeed deleted a lot of contacts a few days ago, but I for sure didn't delete many of those that are gone, and many that I deleted, are back again.  <answer195885> Not sure what happened but you should be able to restore your iPhone from within iTunes. Depending on when the backup was made that should have emeverything/em that was on your iPhone.  If you have no backups in iTunes that work you can check Time Machine for other backups:  precode/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/ /code/pre  Restore your more recent backup to your local HD and then Option-Click on the restore from backup button in iTunes and select the file you just recovered.  I am doing some of this from memory but that is the general idea.
