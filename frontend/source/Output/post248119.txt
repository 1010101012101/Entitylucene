How can I remove the "Learn Spelling" option from the contextual menu? <body> I would like to completely remove the "Learn Spelling" option from the contextual (right click) menu. I want to be able to remove this item across all applications.  I have been searching with Google for an answer to this for hours. My search has only turned up many articles on how to remove the terms added to the dictionary with this menu item. My search is also turning up many results explaining how to remove "Services" from the contextual menu which does not include this core contextual menu item.  I never want to add anything to the menu, and I very often accidentally add a misspelled word to the dictionary when I am trying to correct it.  I am running OS X El Capitan 10.11.6 and any help would be a huge time saver for me.  <comment306237> What OS X are you running? <comment306238> Version 10.11.6 El Capitan <comment306256> I'm running OS X El Capitan 10.11.5 and do not see this, is this something new in 10.11.6? <comment306259> I apologize, Google Chrome calls it "Add to Dictionary", Mac OS X calls it "Learn Spelling". I will update question. I may have asked this question in the wrong place. I want to remove any option in any app that allows the adding of misspelled words to the dictionary. I thought Google Chrome simply adopted the menuitem from Mac OS X because it adds the terms to the same file.  Maybe I should delete this question? <comment306260> I don't believe it would be possible to remove it, no.
