Only hibernate when closing the lid, display sleep otherwise? <body> I am looking for a way to hibernate (i.e. RAM saved to HDD then turned off) strongonly/strong when closing the lid. When the lid is opened, I expect OSX to simply turn off the screen after X minutes (i.e. everything keeps running). Mostly what a Windows PC does out of the box.  codepmset/code does not seem to make possible controlling what happens when closing the lid.  <answer192160> Hibernate only (not sleep) when closing the lid:  precodesudo pmset -a hibernatemode 25 /code/pre  And to go back to "normal" behavior:   precodesudo pmset -a hibernatemode 3 /code/pre  As for the sleep behavior with an open lid, just slide the Computer sleep timer to codeNever/codein System Preferences  Energy Saver. Alternatively do  precodesudo pmset -a sleep 0 /code/pre  <comment228460> You mean that the mac should hibernate (write RAM to disk) and not sleep when you close the lid, right? <comment231243> Was your question solved? <comment241058> @n1000 no, I am in hibernate mode 25, and it behaves exactly as I want in lid-not-closed state but it does not hibernate when closing the lid... I tested playing music: closing the lid does not stop the music. <comment241060> Sorry - I am confused. So it does not sleep at all when the lid is closed? Maybe you want to clarify your question... <comment241068> @n1000 done. Yes, it does not hibernate when the lid is closed (the music keeps playing). But at least since I changed the hibernate mode to 25, it behaves as I wanted with the lid opened (only the screen turns off, the network keeps connected, programs keep running, etc.).
