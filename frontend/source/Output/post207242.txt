Thank you in advance  <answer207244> Slow-mo videos are videos recorded in a higher framerate. To make them slower, Photos plays them back at a lower framerate. This is nothing to do with the file and everything to do with the playback of the file. When you upload the file elsewhere, it's still in a higher framerate, but you're playing it back at this higher framerate. If you want to watch it slower, use Photos to adjust the playback speed.  <comment249919> use Photos to  adjust speed i didnt got u <comment249940> There is an app for OS X that is called "Photos". You can adjust the video there and then export it for use.
