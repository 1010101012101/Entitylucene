How to fix message spam from usbmuxd in console (_SendDetachNotification/_SendAttachNotification) <body> My console is flooded with messages like these:  precode11.01.12 21:21:39,819 com.apple.usbmuxd: _SendDetachNotification (thread 0x7fff7f6cb960): sending detach for device d0:23:db:3e:0b:82@fe80::d223:dbff:fe3e:b82._apple-mobdev._tcp.local.: _BrowseReplyReceivedCallback got bonjour removal. 11.01.12 21:21:46,596 com.apple.usbmuxd: _SendAttachNotification (thread 0x7fff7f6cb960): sending attach for device d0:23:db:3e:0b:82@fe80::d223:dbff:fe3e:b82._apple-mobdev._tcp.local.: _GetAddrInfoReplyReceivedCallback matched. 11.01.12 21:21:46,729 usbmuxd: _AMDeviceConnectByAddressAndPort (thread 0x100781000): IPv4 /code/pre  They always happen in this combination of three messages and around every 10-30seconds  Any suggestions where this is coming from and how to fix/disable it?  strongEdit:/strong (additional Infos)br Ok it seems to be originating from my iPhone (MAC coded0:23:db:3e:0b:82/code)...  There are no Wifi-Printers or anything like that in the Network.br And the Messages are still there when all USB Devices are disconnected.  strongEdit2:/strongbr This seems to be coming from iPhone Wifi-Sync, is there any way to get rid of this spam without diabling Wifi-Sync for the phone?  <answer36609> These messages disappear when you disable wifi sync for your iDevices. This is really annoying me, too, because I like wifi sync, but the log becomes useless with all the usbmuxd spam.  <answer37564> Open Console and highlight the usbmuxd spam, then click [ignore sender] in the toolbar:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4t6Nu.png" alt="usbmuxd"  To re-enable usbmuxd spam, click the [^] symbol in the lower bottom left corner then (x):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gIRSo.png" alt="usbmuxd"  hr  This will allow you to safely ignore strongany/strong Console spam you would like without actually disabling anything other than the message that you see in Console.  <answer37618> You can always edit your code/etc/syslog.conf/code file to send messages from usbmuxd to their own private log file. If you never want to see them, send it to code/dev/null/code.  <answer41761> What is also interesting is that this is last entry I see in the console before my Mac hangs (well it's the last entry I see before the reboot messages). Could be a coincidence, of course, because there are so many of these messages. I've tried disabling usbmuxd to see if it is relating to the hanging problem.  I moved /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.usbmuxd.plist to ~/Documents and restarted. You can move it back and restart to get it running again.  <answer46370> The _apple-mobdev._tcp.local. is an mDNS message (aka bonjour) and is being broadcast on your network from an iPhone.   You can see it being broadcast on your network by running:  precodedns-sd -B _apple-mobdev /code/pre  on any Mac. It is the iPhone advertising it can be attached to.  <answer50156> Something is wrong with the way OS X / iTunes handles the wifi sync to the 4S. Connect it by cable and drag a few songs to it, let it sync via wire, and the console messages should disappear after that..  Hope its fixed in a software update.  <answer211362> I had the same problem and quitting duet (the app to use the iPhone as a Mac display) fixed the problem.   <comment41372> Do you have a USB or network printer attached to the machine? <comment41373> No. And even if I unplug all USB devices this message is still showing up in the console. <comment41374> OK. Do you have an iPhone? If so, can you look under SettingsGeneralAbout and tell me what your Wi-Fi Address is? Also, can you go open /Applications/Utilities/Network Utility.app, under the Info tab select your default connection method and tell me what the hardware address is? Also, do you have a wireless printer in the area? <comment41376> It seems to be originated from the iPhone (the MAC in the message is the one used by the phone, nice call on that). My Airpot uses `00:1d:4f:ff:a2:5b` as it's MAC. There are no Wifi-Printers <comment41420> Do you sync your iPhone over WIFI with iTunes? <comment41427> Have you installed Xcode at any time? I had a similar problem which was related to Xcode. <comment41449> @Mattlove yes i'm syncing over wifi but this also happens when itunes is not running <comment41450> @Anthony yes i've got xcode - what did you do to solve that? <comment41479> I had something similar, although it wasn't coming from my iPhone, it was coming from a broken install of Xcode (something to do with the interface with the iPhone simulator). I removed Xcode, then reinstalled. Hope this helps. <comment41955> Yep this is the problem, is just don't know how to get rid of the spam without disabling wifi sync... <comment42467> Getting hammered with frequent (loud!) warnings from VirusBarrier X6 related to USBMUXD activity. Stopped when I disabled the Wi-Fi/iPad option in iTunes. <comment42889> This isn't a perfect solution as it may disable some relevant bug messages from usbmuxd too but it's probably the best solution at the moment. Thanks :) <comment48346> same for me.  i am getting lots of crashes and time when my mini wont wake up.  This is always the last thing in the logs.  Did disabling it stop the crashing?  i just turned off wifi sync for my iPhone, we'll see if that helps.
