How prevent changes on iPod syncing back to iTunes <body> From the tests I have done it seems that if I delete songs or playlists on my iPod touch and then sync, the song/playlist is deleted in iTunes.  This is a problem if for eg. someone else uses my iPod and deletes something, when I sync I won't even know that I have lost stuff in my master library - any ideas on this?  <comment185252> Deleting a song from your iPod shouldn't (isn't supposed to) delete the songs from your iTunes library when you sync. <comment185253> You can disable automatic sync for each device you have in iTunes.
