AppleScript: Get Image Location Data <body> I am trying to write an Automator Script which involves, among other things, getting the GPS location data from an image. This will be a Finder Service.  From what I have been able to discover so far, it involves running some AppleScript and talking to the codeImage Events/code headless application.  From here, how do I actually get the Latitude &amp; Longitude of the image?  I know there are applications which can read this data, including on the command line, but I wondered whether it was available to MacOS without adding anything.  <answer271186> I do not believe Image Events is able to get that type of meta data from the photo however codemdls/code can do it, e.g. codemdls -name kMDItemLatitude -name kMDItemLongitude /path/to/photo/code however it all depends what exactly your trying to do with this info. I personally prefer using codeexiftool/code however you'd have to install it.  To answer the question in your comment:  If you query an codeattributeName/code when using code-raw/code and the codeattributeName/code doesn't exist the output is literally code(null)/code and if you want it to be something else then use code−nullMarker markerString/code, e.g.: code−nullMarker "Does Not Exist"/code  precodemdls -name kMDItemFake -raw -nullMarker "Does Not Exist" /path/to/photo /code/pre  In the example command above codekMDItemFake/code is a fake codekMDItem/code item, so that command will output: codeDoes Not Exist/code instead of code(null)/code.  In other words, if as example the photo doesn't have codekMDItemLatitude/code info and you query for it the output will be code(null)/code when using codemdls -name kMDItemLatitude -raw/code. To change that, use code−nullMarker markerString/code.  If a codekMDItem/code doesn't exist and you want no output when using codemdls -name attar -raw/code then use codemdls -name attar -raw −nullMarker '' /path/to/photo/code.  <comment340871> I do not believe Image Events is able to get that type of meta data from the photo however `mdls` can do it, e.g. `mdls -name kMDItemLatitude -name kMDItemLongitude /path/to/photo` however it all depends what exactly your trying to do with this info. I personally prefer using `exiftool` however you'd have to install it. If you'd provide more information about what your trying to do and be a bit more explicit and specific it would be easier to write up and answer. <comment340873> @user3439894 Looks Good. Can you change your comment into an answer so I can accept it? <comment340874> I can however do you need any additional information or are you good with just what I've said? <comment340875> @user3439894 You comment answered the question I asked, so that should be enough. However, if you happen to know how to use the `-nullMarker` option (it doesn’t seem t work for me, even when I use the `raw` option), or whether there is an alternative for RAW files, that would be a bonus. Otherwise, it’s good. <comment341017> Thanks for your answer. I have a related question: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/271289/apple-mdls-metadata-list-command-on-networked-drive for which which you might have some insight.
