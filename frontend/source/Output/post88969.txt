How to make my Garage Band '11 ringtone louder? <body> I created a ringtone using strongGarage Band '11/strong and my bass directly inputted to my MAC. I was able to create the ringtone I wanted, and selected the 30 second loop, however the volume is really low. I've tried bumping up the volume on both the track and the monitor locations but still way lower than, say a purchased ringtone.  Anyone know of a place I may be overlooking?   strongUPDATE:/strong   I adjusted the settings in preferences under Audio/MIDIimg src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VqS0N.png" alt="Audio/Midi settings window"  And I also unchecked codeExport Projects at Full Loudness/code just to see if there was any difference in the output. But it sounded identical to the previous export: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LK3Vg.png" alt="Advanced Settings"  <answer89082> I found a solution that works for me. Thanks to strongbmike/strong for pointing me in the right direction. What I used was the codeVisual EQ/code to bump up the codeOutput level/code of my master track. The codeVisual EQ/code is found under codeMaster Effects/code of the codeMaster Track/code window:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KpMcA.png" alt="Visual EQ is found under Master Effects"  I adjusted to taste and strongboom!/strong I've got a much better volume level for my ringtone.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/axxhz.png" alt="Visual EQ window"  <comment104331> Is the input from your bass routed through the usual input channels? Did you check the volume settings in Preferences for the corresponding channel? <comment104332> My guess is the export to iTunes has a volume normalization step. Have you played with limiters or compression to remove the peaks (and make the rest louder) or otherwise [run the master track](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeI7Ip39kIE) through [the compressor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_range_compression#Marketing) to make the sound denser? <comment104353> Thanks patrix. I adjusted the settings in Preferences but I don't hear a difference yet. <comment104436> Thanks bmike, I found the `Compressor` settings in the `Master Track`. And it helped a bit. I also found the `Visual EQ` to be quite effective. The `Visual EQ` settings are in the same area, so your comment lead me to the answer I was looking for!
