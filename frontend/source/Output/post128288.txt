Automator command line: "Unable to open workflow" <body> I created a workflow in Automator consisting of a single action, "Convert Format of Word Documents" (provided by Microsoft Word). I saved this in code~/Documents/convert_word_to_pdf.app/code. I can run it by dragging a word file over this app, and it will generate a PDF for me. However, I can't figure out how to run it through the command line. I tried running codeautomator convert_word_to_pdf.app foo.docx/code and I get codeUnable to open workflow./code. I also tried codeconvert_word_to_pdf/code and codeconvert_word_to_pdf/document.wflow/code as arguments to codeautomator/code, with the same results. What am I missing here?  <answer128682> Use code-i/code:  precodeautomator -i foo.docx ~/Documents/convert_word_to_pdf.app /code/pre  Or if there are multiple arguments:  precodeprintf %s\\n foo.docx bar.docx|automator -i - ~/Documents/convert_word_to_pdf.app /code/pre  See the man page:  precodeSYNOPSIS      automator [-v] [-i input] [-D name=value ...] workflow  DESCRIPTION      automator runs the specified workflow.

It'll look like:  code~/Documents/convert_word_to_pdf.app/Contents/MacOS/Application\ Stub path/to/foo.docx/code  <comment150293> And `~/Documents/convert_word_to_pdf.app foo.docx` ? <comment150503> That didn't work either :( <comment150512> And what's the error ?
