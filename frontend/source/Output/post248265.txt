Time Machine - Encrypted Backups - How to Have TM Prompt User For Password Again <body> I'm using Time Machine with encrypted backups on my macbook air.  A few weeks ago, I selected "remember my computer," when typing in the password to allow my time machine to backup, so now, when I plug in my external drive, it doesn't ask me for the password.  I've been looking for the option to switch it back recently and can't find it anywhere.  Anyone know where this would be located?  <answer248269> I am not sure, but this may work. Try this:  ol liOpen Time Machine from System Preferences /li liTurn Time Machine Off/li liSelect Backup Disk and turn Time Machine back on/li liChoose to Encrypt Back Up/li liRe-enter your password, or create a new password/li liWait for it to encrypt/li liTurn Time Machine off, and then on again to test it out/li /ol  <comment307710> I will try this as soon as I get back from break.  I'll report back after.  Thank you.
