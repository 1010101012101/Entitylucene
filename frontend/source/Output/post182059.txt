Why is the accountsd process eating so much CPU? <body> Why are the codeaccountsd/code and codesecurityd/code processes using so much CPU on OS X 10.10.3?br I am on a Early 2011 Macbook Pro.  What are these processes for? Is it safe to kill them? The machine has only been up 4 hours so has been rebooted recently.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/z2GpV.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer184568> Could you please try to log out of all you iCloud Services, reboot and login again.   I have the same issue, which occurs randomly. I'm suspecting iCloud or my Mail accounts in System Preferences. From time to time systems preference pane is asking me to enter my google passwords, which I decline to do.  <answer190997> Per someone else's suggestion on a similar thread, I deselected the Mail  Preferences  Accounts  Advanced  Automatically Detect and Maintain Account Settings and the CPU dropped back to normal range. I have 3 google, 1 yahoo, and iCloud accounts. Hopefully this fix will stick. I had run Disk Util multiple times for same issue, and there seem to be continual permissions errors popping up, so not sure if another underlying process or this was it. Good luck!  <answer191051> In Mail.app's application's preferences, I deselected "Accounts  Advanced  Automatically Detect and Maintain Account Settings" on two Google accounts, and CPU usage returned to normal.  <answer192012> I got accountsd to quiet down by exiting and restarting the Mail app. It went from around 60% CPU to 0% CPU. No reboot was required.  I'm not sure what triggered its bad behavior, but I emwas/em looking at my accounts and provisioning profiles in Xcode for a very long time.  <answer193504> In the Mail app, go to Window  Activity and try to cancel everything it is doing. That solved it for me  <answer213257> It sounds like that there is a bug in the file indexing of iOS. Sometimes, codeaccountsd/code gets stuck in an indefinite loop while indexing the files in the computer (for Spotlight use). The way to solve it is to reset the indexing on your laptop:  ol liGo to System Preferences- Spotlight- Privacy /li liadd (+) your hard disk (most probably "Macintosh HD") in the "Prevent Spotlight from searching these locations" list. /li /ol  This will erase your previous index file and should solve your problem with the high usage of codeaccountsd/code. However, Spotlight won't work any more. If you don't need it, don't bother to follow the rest of the instructions.   But if you need Spotlight back, remove Macintosh HD from the list by selecting it and clicking the code-/code button. Do this over the night or sometime that you don't need your laptop for few hours as it is going to reindex your files and takes a lot of computer resources.   <answer278144> Unchecking Calendars and Messages in my Google account solved it for me. It is no loss to me, regardless, as I only use Google for some mail at the moment (which I left selected). As to why this was an issue with Google, and why it only became an problem recently, I am at a loss.  <comment216632> If you have FileVault switched on, that can account for `securityd` running hot. `accountsd` may be running hot trying to synchronise your email and CalDAV accounts and pull down all the current information from the server. <comment218360> thanks but I don't have filevault switched on. Quitting Mail.app reduces the accountsd CPU usage back down to 0.1%. I generally find Mail.app's performance to be an issue so perhaps its time to ditch it. <comment227204> this worked, however it cause Gmail account configured with two factor authentication to stop working... <comment227252> @mkrus One of my accounts is a Google for Work (`username@example.com`) and one is normal (`username@gmail.com`). I also see accountsd *crashing* on a desktop machine... <comment233438> The earlier mentioned "Mail  Preferences  Accounts  Advanced  Automatically Detect and Maintain Account Settings and the CPU" fix was only part of the answer for me. Turned out, Mail was stuck in a loop trying to synch an account that had been disabled earlier. Manually canceling immediately solved the problem. <comment237978> I tried this, but it didn't solve the problem for me. Logging out from iCloud is a pain because it takes quite some time to set it back up the way it was before. Only try this as a last resort I would say. <comment275584> Perhaps you might configure a 'fake'/invalid account, only to get access to preferences pane.
