Is there a way to make Adium open links with Google Chrome? <body> When someone sends me a link in codeAdium/code I'll click it and Safari will open up. I'd like links to be opened by Google Chrome instead.  I've had a look around the web and in the preferences but for the the life of me I can't figure this simple one out.  Any clues?  NB: My default browser is Google Chrome.  strongEDIT/strong  I'm running version 1.4.1 (i.e. up-to-date). I use this SkypePlugin. Apart from that it's plain vanilla codeAdium/code.  <answer14813> Try to disable the Skype plugin, it must be tempering with the way Adium handles URLs opening.  <comment15933> It's an obvious question, but, is Google Chrome your default browser? <comment15934> Yeh it is. Sorry I'll update my question. <comment15935> Does it happen with other app, too? Like Mail. I don't have a Mac right now, but could you try to open TextEdit, insert a link, wait for it to be detected (line return should do), click on it and see which browser is open? <comment15936> After some googling, I found Filevault might be a culprit, is it enabled? <comment15937> @Loic: I don't use Mail but TextEdit and Terminal open links in Google Chrome. I'm pretty sure all my apps do except Adium. I don't have FileVault enabled. <comment15938> Any Adium extension installed? <comment15939> @Loic: Just the SkypePlugin. Do you think that could be the cause? <comment15940> I don't use it and don't know what it does, but just in case, disabled/uninstall it, and then test if the links work correctly. <comment15941> Looking at the documentation, it doesn't seem SkypePlugin temper with the incoming messages. But it doesn't hurt to temporarily remove it. <comment15942> Some other basic questions: do you use themes to display your messages? Are you up to date? <comment15943> @Loic: It basically allows Adium to hook into Skype. I'll disable it and report back. Just gonna grab a bite to eat first. Thanks for your help with this. :) <comment15945> @Loic: Thank you dear sir. It appears there's some type of bug with the [SkypePlugin](http://www.adiumxtras.com/index.php?a=xtras&xtra_id=5011) that causes this behaviour. It's a shame because it's a useful plugin for me. Oh well. I'll accept an answer from you if you care to write one up. Thanks again. :) <comment15946> Thanks very much Loic. After uninstalling the [SkypePlugin](http://www.adiumxtras.com/index.php?a=xtras&xtra_id=5011) everything is working as it should.
