Microsoft keyboard requiring double capslock press after Sierra update <body> I installed Sierra last night and my Microsoft Wireless Comfort keyboard suddenly started requiring me to press CapsLock two times in order for it to activate caps lock.  I plugged in an Apple keyboard to test, and that still works as intended.   Is there a setting that I'm missing?  <comment315869> If the Apple keyboard works as intended then the problem is probably with the MS keyboard.  Do they have any updated drivers or similar issues on their support site? <comment315982> Confirmed this happening on my MacMini with the Ergonomic 4000 keyboard. More needless tinkering on Apple's part, no doubt. <comment315983> So... I just restarted the iMac and it started working. I have IntelliType 8.2 installed (same as before).. My media keys also started working after restarting. Have you restarted after the Sierra install @JoshuaPech?
