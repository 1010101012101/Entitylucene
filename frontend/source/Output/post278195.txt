How to change the pattern for duplicates files and folders <body> I wonder if there is any way I can change the naming pattern used for duplicate folders.  For example consider a folder I have on my system codescripts.zip/code but when I download another file with the same name it will be named codescripts (1).zip/code  But I want to change this pattern in the way a duplicate folder will get the following name codescripts_1.zip/code.  Is it possible ?  strongEDIT/strong   Suggested answer doesn't work, I've already tried it  <comment350093> *How* does your environment/situation differ from the cited answer?  Just saying "it doesn't work" doesn't help us help you. <comment350103> Please add details about what exactly doesn't work (error messages etc)
