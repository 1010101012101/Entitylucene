Process “ubd” high CPU usage <body> I noticed my MBP got really slow, which must be strange with SSD and 8GB of RAM.   So I opened the Activity Monitor to discover a process called codeubd/code keeps its CPU usage very high, about 120% most of the time:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IonM6.png" alt="ubd process"  I found a thread that discusses the issue but it is related to having hundreds of iCloud certificates in the keychain, which I don't.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y1cNV.png" alt="Just a few iCloud certificates"  How do I go on with diagnosing the issue?  <answer49716> By observing log messages in code~/Library/Logs/Ubiquity/&lt;my username&gt;//code, I realized that Ubiquity (iCloud process) kept trying to create a file in a folder that doesn't exist:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3VQTf.png" alt="ubiquity log"  I opened up the Terminal and created this directory and its parent directories up to code.ubd/code:  precodecd ~/Library/Mobile\ Documents/ sudo mkdir .ubd &amp;&amp; cd .ubd sudo mkdir peer-E2B13E4F-56F7-C79B-1621-E30738B638FE-v23 &amp;&amp; cd peer-E2B13E4F-56F7-C79B-1621-E30738B638FE-v23 sudo mkdir ftr /code/pre  Then I changed the newly created directories' owner from root to myself:  precodecd ../.. sudo chown -R &lt;my username&gt; .ubd/  /code/pre  The fan turned silent instantly.  <answer104691> https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5208590?start=0&amp;tstart=0 :  "Applications that can store documents in iCloud include Preview, TextEdit, Pages, Numbers, Keynote, GarageBand, and some third-party software such as "DayOne," "iA Writer," "MindNode," and perhaps others. If some or all of those applications are suddenly not working well, there may be a problem with iCloud synchronization.  strongBack up all data./strong  Open the iCloud preference pane in System Preferences and uncheck the box marked strongDocuments &amp; Data/strong. See whether there's any improvement. If there is, continue.  Hold down the option key and select  strongGo ▹ Library/strong  from the Finder menu bar. From the folder that opens, move this folder to the Desktop: Mobile Documents (or any other item with a name beginning that way) and move this folder to the Trash: Application Support/Ubiquity Re-enable strongDocuments &amp; Data/strong, log out, log back in, and test. The folders should be recreated automatically. If the issue is resolved, delete the folder you moved to the Desktop.  If you continue to have the same problems, I suggest you contact iCloud Support."  -Linc Davis  <comment59823> Could you specify which version of 10.7 you're using? <comment115334> Nice catch. I'll add that, if I'm not mistaken, you can use `mkdir` with the `-p` switch to create parent directories as needed on a specified path, rather than combining multiple `mkdir` and `cd` commands. :) <comment123193> `sudo` probably isn't required here
