After intsall success. I don't know why clover bootloader show. I were force shutdown. Anh i could startup ever again <comment367434> I use mobilephone to find anyway to fix this problem. <comment367435> Please add any step you already performed (SMC/NVRAM reset etc) to solve your problem to your question and **not** in the comments! Please remove your comments afterwards. <comment367436> **We** know even less than **you** why Clover is installed on your Mac! So **you** have to explain it to the community... <comment367437> Where did you get the 10.12 USB? Apple Store or *'somewhere else'*? My guess is it was 'somewhere else' & was meant for a Hackintosh, not a real Mac. <comment367442> Can you boot into target disk mode? If you can, there’s a way, or Apple’s the way to go. <comment367447> Thanks for all response. I will bring my macbook to apple center to fixed.
