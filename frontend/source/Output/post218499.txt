Gatekeeper dialog on El Capitan is missing... localized strings? <body> I really have no idea what to make of this, but on one of the machines I've upgraded to El Capitan, all of the gatekeeper dialogs display without localized strings:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ce3wG.png" alt="weird gatekeeper dialog"  This displays after launching Chromium from the dock just after having replaced it with a new version by copying an app bundle from a DMG to the Applications folder.  This is clearly not expected behavior, but I'm not sure what I could do to fix it besides reinstalling El Cap (which I'm not too keen on doing if I can avoid it).  Has anyone else seen anything like this, and/or have any ideas for troubleshooting?  <answer218503> I have no definite solution since I haven't seen this issue before, but a few ideas you could try:  ul liRunning "First Help" on your drive in Disk Utility/li liIf you have Time Machine enabled, revert to the latest viable backup/li liFind out what exactly you replaced and undo (parts of) that manually/li /ul
