OS X Mail App - How to send an email at a specific date and time <body> Just for my curiosity and knowledge, is there any way to create different emails and have them delivery automatically at a specific date and time?  As provider I do use iCloud.com and Gmail.com and I have OS X 10.10 Mail App.   <answer196115> There is a plugin for mail SendLater unfortunately it costs money. Maybe there are some similar free plugins.  <comment234218> Hi. You may want to look at this post as it provides a way of using Apple Script to add this functionality [link](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/45604/how-can-i-send-a-mail-message-later)
