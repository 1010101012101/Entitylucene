SFTP - how to tunnel to private AWS server behind AWS NAT <body> I need to SFTP connect to a AWS server behind a NAT server in a private subnet.  Login to both the NAT server and the private subnet server is done using private SSH keys.  In windows, there is WinSCP which lets you create a SSH tunnel through the NAT server and then connect to the private subnet server.  What options exist in the OS X environment? Fugu is old. No other GUI seems to support SSH Tunnels  I have yet to figure out the terminal command lines or combination of terminal command lines and existing SFTP GUIs that let me tunnel.  Thanks!  <answer218728> You can use local TCP forwarding in codessh/code, for example:  precodessh -L 2222:private:22 user@gateway /code/pre  And then connect any of your graphical tools to the private server by connecting to codelocalhost:2222/code, or just use again command line codesftp/code:  precodesftp private_user@localhost -P 2222 /code/pre  <comment264523> Thank you @Jakuje.  For whatever reason previous answers just did not make total sense to me but your answer helped me do this.
