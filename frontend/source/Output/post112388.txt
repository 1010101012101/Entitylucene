List all tags in Terminal in Mavericks? <body> Is it feasible to list all tags already defined in OS X in Terminal?  I know there are some third-party applications that list all tags, but I just want to use Terminal to find all tags, since I use this tool to work with tags in Terminal (but unfortunately the tool doesn't provide to list tags for an entire system - it just lists for a single or multiple files selected arbitrarily).  Thanks.  <answer112397> The tags name are in code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.list/code.   You can read it with   precodedefaults read com.apple.finder.plist ViewSettingsDictionary /code/pre  It will need some parsing to be a bit clearer :   precodedefaults read com.apple.finder.plist ViewSettingsDictionary |      awk 'NR%12==2'| grep -o '".*"' |  sed 's/^.\(.*\).\{18\}$/\1/' /code/pre  Other possibility is parsing the plist as xml. To do that you'll need to first convert the plist from binary to xml using.   codeplutil -convert xml1 ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist/code  <answer113605> That list isn't comprehensive. It's only tags added through Finder. There's an additional file code~/Library/SyncedPreferences/com.apple.finder.plist/code, that also lists the tags that have been manipulated in Finder.  If you tagged a file in Terminal or using another tool and never manipulated the tags in Finder, then the tags won't be in either list.  <answer113667> You can also use tag:  precodetag -tgf \*|grep '^    '|cut -c5-|sort -u /code/pre  codetag -f \*/code finds all files with tags, code-t/code includes tag names in the output, and code-g/code prints each tag on a separate line.  <answer114083> You can also use mdfind in combination with mdls to get the same result:  precode/usr/bin/mdfind -0 "(kMDItemUserTags == '*')" |xargs -0 mdls -name kMDItemUserTags |grep '^    ' |cut -c5- |cut -d , -f 1 |sort -u /code/pre  Would be interesting to benchmark, which one is faster.  <answer119985> Colour followed by path:  code/usr/bin/mdfind -0 "(kMDItemUserTags == '*')" | xargs -I % sh -c 'echo $(mdls -name kMDItemUserTags % | grep "^    " |cut -c5-) %'/code  <comment131943> Hmmm... even if I used `awk` the result was clumsy, as I got something like ` "mytag_Tag_ViewSettings" =     {`, where `mytag` is what I'm looking for. Thus I think it's much easier to just open Finder and navigate toward the tag bar. Thanks for your answer though. <comment131956> I updated my parsing part, it now returns only the name :) <comment174407> Everybody should look at @TedWise answer below, it explains why the list obtained through this method is not complete. <comment236247> Similar: [Listing all Openmeta Tags and associated Files](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/24494/8546) (2011-09-08) <comment236248> No mention of OpenMeta in the opening question, but it's worth noting that the current version of `tag` does not list OpenMeta tags on Mavericks. https://github.com/jdberry/tag/issues/17 is 'Add limited support for OpenMeta'. <comment305824> FYI: With OS X El Capitan, the equivalent command is, `defaults read com.apple.finder.plist FavoriteTagNames`.  However, that list doesn't include custom tag names.
