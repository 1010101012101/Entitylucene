How can I know which setting TinkerTool is modifying? <body> Is there any way to easily know which setting a TinkerTool option relates to in Mac OS X?  For example, the strongShow Hidden and System Files/strong setting seems to be related to codecom.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles/code. What about all the other settings?   <answer45388> This may not really be the answer you´re looking for, but I´d suggest having a look at secrets.blacktree.com for a very good database of hidden OS X settings (they also offer a preference pane to manipulate them).   If you´re looking for a more specific function that is available in TinkerTool, chances are that someone around here will know the command line way for it ;-)   <answer45389> Here’s a generic solution to find out what changed after applying a certain setting. I used this to create my code.osx/code file which is full of hidden OS X tweaks.  Open Terminal.app, codecd/code into a temporary directory, and check the difference between codedefaults read/code output before and after changing the setting.  precodecd /tmp defaults read &gt; a # change the setting using TinkerTool or however you like defaults read &gt; b diff a b # view the difference /code/pre  If you’d rather use a UI to view the diffs instead of the codediff/code binary, you could download the Kaleidoscope.app trial.  hr  Alternatively, you could do a Spotlight search within the past hour/day/minute for codeplist/code files. That will only tell you which file changed, though; you would still have to figure out which setting in the file was tweaked.  <answer45413> The most GUI-friendly way I can think of would be to use the endlessly-fascinating fseventer, which lets you see which files on your disk are changing, in real time. With a bit of filtering, you can narrow it down to showing only those files that are changing in your Preferences folders, as you make settings changes in TinkerTool (or anywhere else).  <answer45471> Here is something you might try:  1) Purchase the paid version of TinkerTool for €11.90. It's called TinkerTool System 2.  2) Send an email to the developer, Marcel Bresink. Tell him that you are a paid customer. Ask him nicely if he will tell you the answer to your specific question.  I don't know Marcel, but in my experience, independent shareware software developers are very helpful when you help them out by buying one of their modestly-priced products.  <comment51688> Spotlight search within past (hour, day, minute) for plist files. <comment51915> Or, you could use [my webapp](http://www.sensefulsolutions.com/2010/12/javascript-client-side-diff-tool.html) to see the differences in a GUI. <comment51916> Nice tool, @Senseful! There’s another one here: http://kpdecker.github.com/jsdiff/ <comment51926> That app sounds very useful. The link is broken though. <comment52202> Is this curiosity, or what do you plan to use this information for? <comment52413> @DanielL: I originally was wondering because I thought it could help another user based on [this answer](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/45353/218) I provided. However, I think it could benefit other people if there is a specific setting that TinkerTool fixes for them, but they don't want to have to install the entire product. <comment52440> Link works fine for me in Safari (just tried it again), but you can navigate to the fseventer download from their home page too: http://fernlightning.com <comment52452> Ah. To try to duplicate its functionality without installing it. Makes sense.
