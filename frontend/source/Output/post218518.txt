How to use cd with shell variable containing spaces <body> I am trying to create an environment variable for a path that is long, has a space, and syntax.  I tried the following:  precodeexport temp=/Users/username/Dropbox (Personal) /code/pre  And added it to my .profile.  I also tried:  precodeexport temp='/Users/username/Dropbox (Personal)' export temp="/Users/username/Dropbox (Personal)" export temp=/Users/username/Dropbox\ \(Personal\) /code/pre  None of the above work. My end goal is to type codecd $temp/code or codecp $temp/code.   <answer218521> Besides the first assignment, all three work in assigning the correct value to code$temp/code. But due to the way codebash/code parses the command line, you need to write  precodecd "$temp" /code/pre  afterwards to make it work (which also means that it is a good idea to always use code"$var"/code in shell scripts).  It might be easier in your case to make an alias with  precodealias cdtemp='cd "/Users/username/Dropbox (Personal)"' /code/pre  for use with codecd/code.  For codecp/code you still need to add the "" though. To avoid this, either name your folders without using characters with special meaning to the shell or create a symlink with codeln -s ~/"Dropbox (Personal)" ~/DP/code.  <answer218531> You can use wildcards:  precodeexport temp="/Users/username/Dropbox??Personal?" /code/pre  or:  precodeexport temp="/Users/username/Dropbox*Personal*" /code/pre  Now, codecd $temp/code should work.  <comment264173> I'd considered "$temp" but it seems a little less simple than what I wanted. An alias command notwithstanding is there any alternative that would allow me to use $temp (without quotes"? <comment264175> Use folder names without characters having special meaning for the shell (the space in your case). Or make a symlink with `ln -s ~/"Dropbox (Personal)" ~/DP` and use this afterwards. <comment264207> `cd "${temp}"` is even better at making sure everything is correctly escaped. <comment264218> @orkoden Using {} helps in separating the name of an variable from other text (which is not required here), it doesn't impact the interpretation of the content of the variable <comment264238> It is a good point. Changing the folder to something without special characters is something I looked into. Dropbox doesn't seem to allow one to change the folder name (at this time).
