How do I access my old files from an old Macbook HDD with Lubuntu? <body> I wasn't sure if I should put this on the Apple or Linux stack exchange but here's my problem. So my old Macbook died a while back and I realized that it might have had some important information. My main PC now is a Lubuntu Desktop. So what I did was I bought a SATA with an HDD power connecter to USB cord and I plugged the SATA side into the HDD and the USB into my PC. I was able to get into the HDD's files, but when I was getting into the documents file it said that I could not access it due to permissions. So I changed the permissions and when I clicked apply it said "Error setting permissions: Read-only file system". Can someone tell me how to save the information on the HDD while being able to access it?  <answer210209> This is probably due to your FS type and your old disk which is probably HFS+. You need to add extra packages to read it.  Try this link: https://askubuntu.com/questions/332315/how-to-read-and-write-hfs-journaled-external-hdd-in-ubuntu-without-access-to-os  Here's the copy paste of the answer :     First, make sure that you have hfsprogs installed. Example installation command:  precodesudo apt-get install hfsprogs /code/pre      Next, mount or remount the HFS+ drive; commands need to be as follows:  precodesudo mount -t hfsplus -o force,rw /dev/sdXY /media/mntpoint /code/pre      or  precodesudo mount -t hfsplus -o remount,force,rw /mount/point /code/pre      Finally, if the drive was improperly unmounted or has otherwise become partially corrupted run fsck.hfsplus ... as such:  precodesudo fsck.hfsplus -f /dev/sdXY /code/pre   <comment253659> Target Disk mode only works with two working Macs.
