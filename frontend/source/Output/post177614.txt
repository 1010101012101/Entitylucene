Preview in Yosemite prints with large margins, unlike previous version <body> Before Yosemite, Preview could print large scale text with no noticeable margin by simply increasing "Custom Scale". In the Yosemite-Preview, it is no longer possible to do so. I tried adjusting margins to "0" under Paper size/Manage custom sizes, and yet I am still losing approximately 3/4" in margin on the top and bottom.  When printing two pages on one, this makes the print just small enough to be difficult to read; When I increase text size enough to make it readable, the page top and bottom are cut off. It's not a printer problem because the old Preview wasn't like this. Would the previous version of Preview work with Yosemite?
