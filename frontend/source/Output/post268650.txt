iTerm2: Select Text keybinding disappeared <body> I seem to have inadvertently removed the ability to select text using the keyboard: e.g. kbdShift/kbd+kbd‚Üê/kbd.  I've scrolled through the default key bindings in both Preferences  Keys and Preferences  Profiles  Keys. In the latter, Terminal.app Compatibility seems the most natural.  And it's probably really simple...
