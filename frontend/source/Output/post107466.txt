My Macbook Pro keeps on restarting after installing OS X Mavericks <body> My MacBook Pro keeps on restarting since I installed Mavericks. I can start it in Safe Mode, but it wouldn't start up at all normally - it throws me back to the username and password screen.  How can I stop this from happening and boot normally?  <comment126026> Did you reset PRAM and SMC? <comment126209> yes i did but still it does the same thing
