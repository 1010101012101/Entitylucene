How can I recover from a frozen fullscreen application / game? <body> A few times now, Starcraft 2 has frozen up on my wife's Macbook Pro, but the mouse pointer still moves and the sound keeps playing.  I can also SSH in from a different machine.  The keyboard shortcut for force-quit doesn't work though, and nothing in-game is clickable.  Command-tab won't switch windows either.  If this were a straight-up Linux box, I'd find the application process and kill it from an SSH login.  If that failed, I might take out the X server.  Can I do anything like this in OSX?  Is there something on the "problem" machine I can do locally instead?  <answer32862> ol liSearch for the Starcraft 2 process in the process list. I don't know the name of the binary but something like codeps aux | grep -i starcraft/code should get you there/li liThe number in the second column is the PID/li licodekill PID/code or (if this doesn't work) codekill -9 PID/code (if you are not the owner of the process, you can use codesudo kill .../code instead)/li /ol  Depending on the process structure of Starcraft 2 you may need to do this several times to hit the right one.  <comment37562> All process management you'd do on Linux exists equally as much in OS X. <comment37592> If you know the name of the process (e.g. this one is probably "Starcraft 2"), a shorter path is `killall 'Starcraft 2'`. (Caution: Do not generalize this advice to other UNIX systems; `killall` may mean kill *everything*.) <comment37619> I couldn't find anything in the process list that looked like "starcraft", "blizzard", or "sc2" -- that's why I figured the next step up the chain was "log the user out".  I realize it's sort of the "low-yield nuclear option" but IMHO it's better than a hard power cycle. <comment157072> In this case, you should find the Starcraft process. Maybe you don't have the full list of processes. I use `ps -ax`. Try this.
