Assign Tab to switch input method <body> I want to use kbdTab/kbd to switch to the previously-used input source, and kbd⇧ Shift/kbdkbdTab/kbd as the usual tab function.  As a Chinese language user, the key combination I use the most is kbd⌘ Command/kbdkbdSpace/kbd, which selects the previous input source. Since I only have two keyboards enabled, selecting the previous input source is the same thing as toggling between them. For every non-English user, this switch is frequent.  To make it easier, I want to use kbdTab/kbd to switch input sources.  Following this, a kbd⇧/kbdkbdTab/kbd sounds like a good idea to perform the normal function of kbdTab/kbd.   However, System Preferences (as I tried it) only allows the user to set the switch as a combination starting with kbd⇧ Shift/kbd or kbd⌃ Control/kbd.  Is my request unreasonable? Or can it be done?  <answer267407> Oh, I found Karabiner Elements works for Sierra, and I am very satisfied now.   Previously, Karabiner is out of order in Sierra.  Indeed, Sierra starts to offer custom remaps among those of kbd⇪Caps Lock/kbd, kbd^Control/kbd, kbd⌥Option/kbd, and kbd⌘Command/kbd, with System Preferences  Keyboard  Keyboard  Modifier keys.  Still, I cannot use any of them to switch input source with System Preferences  Keyboard  Keyboard  Shortcuts  Input Sources.   There has been several months, and today I visited Karabiner's homepage again.  They say they produced a Karabiner Elements for Sierra, but I cannot compile myself, though had not closely studied the error message.  Besides, fortunately there is a latest compiled image.  The link is not anywhere obvious on their homepage, but I found it in another forum discussion, so I hope more people seeing this (my post) can find this image.   Karabiner Elements works fine, as far as I see, for simple assignment of keys — i.e. to force the physical key codeX/code's signal to be interpreted as key codeY/code's function.  This is my setting.  Physical kbd⇪Caps Lock/kbd now performs the function of kbdEsc/kbd,  and kbdEsc/kbd that of kbd`/kbd,  and kbd`/kbd that of kbd↹Tab /kbd,  and kbd↹ Tab/kbd that of kbdF4/kbd (or something else),  and kbdF4/kbd that of kbd⇪Caps Lock/kbd.  Then I set kbdF4/kbd to switch to the previously-used input source.  I am proud of my setting. Vim users for non-Latin family language will save considerable effort with this!  <comment335392> Have you tried https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/index.html.en <comment335450> Thank you @timothymh, your edit is succinct. Btw, I think my reference to Vim is relevant, because it gets more cumbersome to toggle input source AND to leave/enter input mode --- But it's enough that I mention this in this comment. <comment335475> @Bowen Yes, I have heard Karabiner. A notice says Sierra is not supported on the very page you cited.
