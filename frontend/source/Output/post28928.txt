What is the OSX equivalent to Window's AppData folder? <body> I was originally looking for my Google Chrome profile because something went wrong and I need to delete it. In the process I realized that I don't know where applications in general are putting this kind of stuff.  Where is the typical place to go looking?  <answer28930> I had this happen and I fixed the problem by relogging in to Google Sync.  The profile file is stored in:  code~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/code  Usually an application will install data in code/Library/Preferences//code and/or code~/Library/Preferences//code.  Data can also be placed after any of the following patterns:  code/Library/Preferences/&lt;application name&gt;//code  code~/Library/Preferences/&lt;application name&gt;//code  code/Library/Application Support/&lt;application name&gt;//code  code~/Library/Application Support/&lt;application name&gt;//code  code/Library/&lt;application name&gt;//code  code~/Library/&lt;application name//code   <answer28931> This kind of data is frequently stored in code~/Library/Application Support/code.  User-specific settings are frequently stored in code~/Library/Preferences/code  Your Chrome profile is located at code~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/code.  I recommend going on a little exploration of the ~/Library folder; there's a lot of useful stuff in there.  <comment33261> Note that in Lion the ~/Library folder is hidden in the finder by default. You can still go there by using the "Go to folder" functionality.
