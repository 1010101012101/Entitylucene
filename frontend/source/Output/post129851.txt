Promise pegasus 4x2TB Disk upgrade <body> I have a promise Pegasus with 4x2TB Hitachi disks, would it work with any (or some specific 4x4TB disks?  <answer129882> Yes that is possible.  You can change one disk after another.  So just grab one disk out, replace it, let the system rebuild. Grab the next one, replace it, let it rebuild. And so on..  That may takes some time, but it works. If it is finished, your RAID will recognize the new 4TB disk-array and give you the new capacity.  <comment152096> There are quite a few Pegasus models out - even considering 4 bay enclosures. Could you link to the specific model you have (and the firmware as that often makes or breaks which drives and sizes will work).
