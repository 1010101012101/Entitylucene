screen lock using a script <body> Is it possible to lock the screen in OS Yosemite using code? And then put in a scheduler to run every two minutes?  If so what script language are we talking, task scheduler program etc  <answer199582> Here is the way I would try completing this task:   ol liCreate a script file that will be executed every time the system starts: /li /ol   precodesudo nano ~/sleep.sh /code/pre   ol start="2" liInput the following text in the file: /li /ol   precode#!/bin/bash sleep 120 pmset sleepnow #osascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to sleep' /code/pre   emNote: The last line with the # at the front is a substitute of the one above (pmset sleepnow)/em  ol start="3" liOpen the CronJob editor in order to start the script frequently: /li /ol     env EDITOR=nano crontab -e   ol start="4" liInput rule for the script to be started automatically/li /ol     * * * * * sh ~/sleep.sh   ol start="5" liRe/start the current CronJobs: /li /ol     sudo touch /private/etc/crontab   P.S. I haven't tested it, but I will gladly help if anything additional is needed.    <comment240316> Do you want to lock the screen every two minutes? What if a user is actively using the Mac?
