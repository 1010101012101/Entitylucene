IKEv2 VPN on macOs 10.12 Sierra <body> When I try to configure an IKEv2 VPN on macOs Sierra the following errors occur:  precodenesessionmanager    Failed to find the VPN app for plugin type com.apple.neplugin.IKEv2 neagent Failed to process IKE SA Init packet /code/pre  From the first line it seems it's not supported at all.  Have you experienced the same issue?  <answer255213> In my situation, setting server-side in ipsec.conf:  precode leftsendcert=always /code/pre  solved the problem.  From ipsec.conf documentation:     left|rightsendcert = never | no | ifasked | always | yes      Accepted values are never or no, always or yes, and ifasked, the   latter meaning that  the peer must send a certificate request (CR)   payload in order to get a certificate in return.   Moreover, I had to add to the Keychain the root certificate and trust in order to validate the certificate sent by the server and I read that if you have intermediate certificates you have to trust them too.  <comment317715> Are you polling to find out if other people are having this problem, or are you looking for assistance in resolving it? The former is off-topic. <comment317809> @tubedogg The latter, of course. <comment334715> For me, manually trusting the root certificate solved the issue. Thanks!
