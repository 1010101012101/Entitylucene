Chrome saved password list is empty <body> Hi I am using Google Chrome on my mac Version Version 55.0.2883.95 (64-bit) and my mac running on 10.11.6 (15G1004) OSX EI Captain.   I can see chrome auto filling my passwords when I login to sites. But When I want to see my passwords, I am not able to see anything in the password list. Any idea how to fix it?  <comment343431> Is Chrome filling them in or is it Keychain? Check by opening Keychain Access and looking for your passwords there. <comment343532> I searched in Keychain...I could not find the url. I am not sure what is the right way to search keychain for chrome's saved passwords.. <comment343563> It's possible it's not in Keychain then, and is being saved by Chrome somewhere independently.
