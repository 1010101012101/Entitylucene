Searching by file name (as opposed to name and contents) in Lion <body> In earlier versions of OSX, when you search in a Finder window, it gave you the choice of searching by contents or file name. In Lion this choice seems to have disappeared, I can only search by content now. Is there any way to search by name in Lion?  <answer18486> ol liOpen a finder window/li liOpen the folder you wish to search in/li liClick in the search box/li liType the text you want to find/li liA dropdown should appear like the one in the image below which allows you to select the 'Filename contains' option/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VaRdZ.png" alt="Finder window"  If you've already run the search and want to alter the search to only look for files with your search term in the filename, you can click the '+' button just beneath the search box and change the search type from there.  See screenshots below:    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DyTI1.png" alt="Finder window 2"    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9lqbJ.png" alt="Finder window 3"  Mike Scott has nice suggestions from the comments that are worth incorporating here to use the strongname:/strong selector in spotlight.  You can prefix your search with codename:/code as shown belowbr img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4tjKt.png" alt="Finder window 4"    This results in a window which you can select 'Filename' or 'Everything' from if you click the button labelled 'name' in the search box as shown below:br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WeoJT.png" alt="Finder window 5"  <answer19205> It does not disappear - just enter your query into the searchfield and hit enter - then click into it again and find the possibility to switch right there.  <answer20832> Ross is correct that the option to switch between searching filenames or contents disappears once you perform your search -- if you don't choose filenames to search filenames from the drop-down when you first type in the search term.  Once you perform the search without having clicked on that drop-down, the drop-down will not appear even if you click again in the search bar.  You have to type another character in the search bar, then delete it, and THEN the drop down appears.  This is pretty stupid on Apple's part. They took something that was simple, very clear and self-explanatory, and made it hard to find, a bit difficult, less useful and inconsistent. If you want to search contents first and then switch to filenames, it's not as easy as the simple click of a visible button.  No logical reason for this. I hope they return the original, better-designed feature.  <answer52489> Search using the strongname:/strong selector  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SLRoG.png" alt="name:index.html in spotlight"  I've also become a big fan of the Found app. It's currently free on the app store and lightning fast (seems faster than LaunchBar to me - and that's saying a lot as it's a speed demon).  <answer52518> ⌃⌘F (File  Find by Name…) also opens a Spotlight window that is set to search by name by default.  <answer268342> Another way would be to use the Terminal and the codemdfind/code command-line utility. Add this function to your code~/.bash_profile/code (or any other shell config file you might use):  precodespot() {   mdfind "kMDItemFSName=='*$@*'cd"; } /code/pre  You can then use the codespot/code function on the command-line:  precodespot foo bar /code/pre  This will search for all files and directories containing the arguments you passed to codespot/code in their name.  Note that codecd/code in the above function is a modifier, making the search case-insensitive (codec/code) and ignoring diacrtical marks (coded/code).

I'd noticed the drop down out of the corner of my eye when I did a search, but I never looked closely at it because I figured it was just the same old useless suggestions list you always got. It's still not as good as the old way though because it disappears when you finish searching - is there any way to get it back without starting the search all over again? I often want to switch to file name search after seeing the results of a content search. <comment20221> Or just prefix your search term with "name:". <comment22612> @Mike Scott: best real-answer-buried-in-a-comment ever. Looks like "filename:" is needed to limit searches just to filenames -- with "name:" the file I'm looking for still gets buried among e-mail message items, etc. <comment60055> Do you really think Apple made this change by mistake or without considering it would force people to change their thinking? I'd say they weighed it carefully and the overwhelming benefit to some was worth pissing off some people. I'd say that's more likely than them being stupid, but we're all allowed our speculation on the issue. <comment60112> As far as I can tell, this opens a window that searches the Desktop folder. Is that the right keyboard shortcut? <comment60190> @daviesgeek It searches in the current folder if you've set that as the default in Finder's preferences. <comment60201> Oh. I get it now :-)
