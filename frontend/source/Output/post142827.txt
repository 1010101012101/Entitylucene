How to get rid of all the apps downloaded to my iPhone from another appleid? <body> This is the most bizarre thing I have seen in Apple; here is what happened. In my country, the Apple reseller store for some reason registers all the people's AppleIDs with their own email addresses and names for first time Apple owners (which I am pretty sure Apple would revoke their license if they found out). Anyways, they did that to my parents and downloaded some apps in it at the time. And after that, somehow my mom was able to register her own AppleID to the phone and purchase apps and everything through her own appleid. Today, I wanted to update all the apps in the phone and suddenly I got asked the password of the appleid used the first time Apple registered her phone... I checked out the settings and app store etc. There is no place in the phone where this appleid is used. So, I am just guessing that it maybe some of the apps they have written to this phone at that time and they needed an update. How can I delete all the apps owned by the "old" appleid on this phone? I have no idea which apps they are, and would want to delete them all in one click without touching the apps downloaded my the current id.
