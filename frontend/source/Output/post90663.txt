Creating keyboard shortcut for converting a file (photo or document) to pdf <body> I'd like to set up a simple keyboard shortcut that would save the currently selected file in the finder as a pdf, assuming it is a filetype that can be converted to pdf. I've already followed this nice shortcut for doing this when the document is open, but now I'm looking to take this one step further and have it work on the file from the finder.   <answer90671> Simple solution with Automator if you are just handling images   You can batch convert these files by:  ol liOpen strongAutomator/strong from code/Applications/code/li liCreate a new strongService/strong/li liDrag the strongGet Specified Finder Items/strong to the workflow builder./li liDrag the strongNew Pdf From Image/strong to the workflow builder/li liSave the service &amp; bind it your keyboard shortcut preferences/li /ol  If you're using other filetypes, you may you the strongPrint finder items/strong action. But it will use a popup if I'm not mistaken.  <comment106460> Box of chocolates ?
