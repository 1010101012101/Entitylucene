Mac Mini with spoiled GPU, can I use it as a game server? <body> I have a higher spec 2011 Mac Mini, i5 Dual Core Hyper-threading, 8GB RAM, dedicated AMD GPU. I damaged the GPU while playing game, it can only boot if I removed the all the AMD related kext, it can boot in to OS X Mavericks, but the UI rendering is painfully slow. I then use it as inefficient network file server as I did not install any other faceless OS.  How should I install the OS into a hard drive externally and place the hard drive back into the Mac Mini?  <comment353682> How can you damage a GPU by playing a game - which game and which options? <comment353719> modded minecraft, 1080p/60fps <comment353720> If this is not doing anything illegal ie fiddly Apple's settings then I would say the computer is not fit for purpose and in the EU at least you could ask for a refund :) <comment353812> too bad I am not from EU, secondly it is long out of warranty when it failed. The whole purpose I am doing this is not primarily for any server application I want to serve. My main idea is don't want to waste a high end i5 processor, it is rare that i5 have hyperthreading.
