Accessing Nokia N900 ssh via USB <body> My MacBook Pro runs El Capitan. I have a Nokia N900 connected via USB. I am trying to access remotely its shell by the ssh protocol. How may I?  <answer275051> After some time, I have been able to solve my issue.  ol liInstalled OpenSSH (server) from Application Manager/li liConnected the N900 to the Mac via USB and selected PC-Suite Mode/li liOn the N900, as root, issued codeifup usb0/code (activates USB)/li liOn the N900, as root, issued code/etc/init.d/ssh start/code (starts OpenSSH)/li liOn the Mac, in Network Preferences (under System Preferences), selected the N900 and configured it manually to have the IP Address 192.168.2.14 and the Subnet Mask 255.255.255.0 (at this point the N900 appears as correctly connected)/li liOn the Mac, in Terminal, issued codessh root@192.168.2.15/code/li /ol  At this point a confirmation is requested and I am prompted for the root password. Connection is then established.  I post all this in the hope of being useful to somebody, maybe with a different device. To be honest I do not understand fully all the passages, especially where I set the IP Address for the N900 as ...14 on the Mac, while by issuing codeifconfig/code on the N900 the reported Address is ...15, and emthis/em has to be used in the final codessh/code command.  If anybody has comments which may me help to understand better what I have been doing, I would appreciate that.
