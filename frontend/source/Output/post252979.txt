Stuck with flashing file folder with a flashing question mark <body> I have a MacBook model A1181 (2007) when I boot it up it goes to the lock screen and wants the password which it won't accept or it goes to a screen with a flashing file folder with a question mark. can anyone tell me how I can fix this problem? I'm okay at fixing issues but I'm stumped on this one. I would really appreciate any help someone might give. thanks Les  <comment315345> This shows that your startup disk can't be found. Consider starting up with another disk or hold Command + R when booting to boot into Recovery Mode, where you can reinstall OS X.
