How to get file sizes of large files in OS X Terminal? <body> I'm trying to get the file size of a big file (1GB +) using the OS X Terminal. I'm using codedu -sh/code. But also after 30 seconds I don't have any result, is there any faster command?  Thanks.  <answer238575> Say you are looking for big files in your home directory, use this command:  precodefind ~ -size +1G /code/pre  Replace strong~/strong with the directory of interest.  h1Update/h1  My original response was wrong, but I'll keep it to remind myself. If you are trying to get the size of a file, try this:  precodestat -f '%z' filename  # Normal file stat -L -f '%z' filename  # symbolic link file /code/pre  I have not figure out how to do it for a directory yet.  <answer238591> You can use the following command      $ sudo find / -type f -size +1G   In case you want to avoid traversing mounted drives, your command should be:     $ sudo find -x / -type f -size +1G   <comment292625> Are you trying to get the size of a single file or all files in a given location? <comment292626> It's different, sometimes it is a folder, file or application. <comment292627> You don't need the `-s` option for a single file. `du -h file` will do the job. <comment292640> Try `ls -lh filename` <comment292645> The `z` option list the total number of bytes used in the file but not the total blocks allocated to the file. To get the total allocated size of a file in bytes you could do something like `echo "$(( $(stat -f'%b' filename) * 512 ))"`
