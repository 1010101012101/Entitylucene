Homebrew-compiled gpg-agent fails, gpg: cancelled by user <body> I'm trying to get gpg-agent working on OS X, compiled with homebrew.  Here's my gpg-agent.conf:  precodedjc@djc-mbp ~ $ cat .gnupg/gpg-agent.conf  pinentry-program /usr/local/bin/pinentry-curses no-grab /code/pre  However, when I try to test it, it fails:  precodedjc@djc-mbp ~ $ echo "test" | gpg -ase -r 30380381 | gpg  You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for user: "Me &lt;me@example.com&gt;" 4096-bit RSA key, ID 30380381, created 2013-09-16  gpg: cancelled by user gpg: no default secret key: bad passphrase gpg: [stdin]: sign+encrypt failed: bad passphrase gpg: processing message failed: eof /code/pre  Any clues on how to get this working?
