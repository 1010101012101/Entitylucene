How do I sort the Facebook News Feed <body> strongEDIT:/strong As of Facebook v10.0, this question received a lot more views as the option has moved again.  See the new answer below.  h3Original Question/h3  I'm using Facebook v6.8 on iPhone 4 running iOS 7.0.4.  In previous versions of Facebook, I could tap a cog icon in the NewsFeed box and select whether to sort by Top Stories or Most Recent.  I can't find that icon any more.  How can I sort by Most Recent?  <answer115370> Whilst at the top of your feed, pull down so you see the News Feed button. Tap that and you can select from All Friends, Most Recent. Lots of other choices are available if you expand the list by tapping the downward facing arrow.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FqqFg.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer130797> As of Facebook v10.0, this option has moved again.  Tap strongMore/strong, then the drop-down next to strongFeeds/strong and find strongMost Recent/strong hidden among the options.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wv0ix.png" alt="Most Recent"  <comment135049> I could have sworn that option wasn't there earlier today. Thanks! <comment135051> @Hand-E-Food You're welcome, glad I could help!
