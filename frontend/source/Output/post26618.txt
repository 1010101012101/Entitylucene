GOM player not running video <body> I am trying to run movie on GOM player for Mac, when I open the movie, GOM player name appears on top of menu bar, but no player appears.   The same .avi file opened well in VLC player. I found out that if there is any other file of same name as .avi but of different extension exist in the folder, GOM player won't run that .avi file. As I have XVZ.avi and XYZ.srt, player didn't opened the file, then I changed the file name to XYZ2.avi. It opened.  What could be the issue?  <answer26761> I'd say it's an issue with GOM Player subtitle renderer.   It's probably trying to open/read the subtitles but fails and this failure makes it impossible to play the video (it's probably a bug in GOM Player, since most player would just skip the subtitle and play the movie anyway).   I'd suggest you try another player, strongVLC/strong is fine, strongPerian/strong works great with QuickTime or strongMPlayerX/strong which is free on the Mac App Store. And they all play subtitles, also.  <answer84101> Just Change your GOM Player SKIN to "BASIC", if it is not.  <comment30347> GOM Player is Windows-only, so why ask here? <comment30434> I guess you are a bit outdated, gom player has Mac port also <comment30439> Sorry, my search at the time didn't yield any good result. Voted to reopen. <comment30927> Thanks, I love GOM player as its controls are more friendly as can fast forward using arrow keys.... <comment31015> I think MPlayerX does that also <comment31270> Thank Wolff, I got MPlayerX Extended...
