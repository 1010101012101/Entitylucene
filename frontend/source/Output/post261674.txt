Create "Application Password" in Keychain <body> A few versions of OS X ago, when I manually created an item in Keychain Access, it would generally be created as a so-called emApplication Password/em, with the corresponding yellow-pencil icon. I liked that.  Now... when I do the same thing, the Keychain item is created as an emInternet Password/em with the little blue strong@/strong icon. This type I like less, not least because Keychain Access ignores my input into the emName/em field of the item.  Any insight into this change? Or into how I can create an emApplication Password/em?
