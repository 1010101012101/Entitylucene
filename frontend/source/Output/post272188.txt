How to enter hardware diagnostic mode without built-in display? <body> The built-in retina display on my MacBook Pro, running Sierra OS, does not work.  I can use the laptop with a HDMI cable to a monitor or HDTV. Everything else works - the camera, audio, microphone, keyboard, etc.  Just one day the display screen went blank and has not worked since.  But when trying to boot-up in "diagnostic mode", the HDMI cable solution does not work, so I can't use diagnostic mode.  We've already tried resetting P-RAM and SMC, and various efforts at re-booting.  What can I do?
