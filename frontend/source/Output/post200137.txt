Send Command to Add remote users through ARD <body> so I'm trying to create an extra admin account on all Macs on the network. There are quite a few so I'm trying to do it through Apple Remote Desktop.  Do you guys know how to do this? This is all I have so far which is obviously missing some parts and giving the error: "no tty present and no askpass program specified." Any help is appreciated.  precode#!/bin/bash # This script creates a user account under Mac OS X sudo dscl . create /Users/SecurityTest33 sudo dscl . create /Users/SecurityTest33 UserShell /bin/bash sudo dscl . create /Users/SecurityTest33 RealName "Security Test3" sudo dscl . create /Users/SecurityTest33 UniqueID 503 sudo dscl . create /Users/SecurityTest33 PrimaryGroupID 1000 sudo dscl . create /Users/SecurityTest33 NFSHomeDirectory /Local/Users/SecurityTest33    sudo dscl . passwd /Users/SecurityTest33 PASSWORD sudo dscl . append /Groups/admin GroupMembership SecurityTest33 sudo cp -R /System/Library/User\ Template/English.lproj /Users/SecurityTest33 sudo chown -R SecurityTest33:staff /Users/SecurityTest33 echo "Created user" #$USERID: $USERNAME ($FULLNAME) /code/pre  <answer200139> The error you're getting is related to the codesudo/code command.  You're probably trying to run the script as the normal administrator.    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rvukD.png" alt="enter image description here"  Instead, you can run it directly as root.  <comment241158> You can use the kickstart utility to configure all the features found in Apple Remote Desktop preferences. It is located at /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ARDAgent.app/Contents/Resources/kickstart <comment241165> Let's close this for a brief hold. If you don't have a script that works locally, let's suss that out first. If you have one that works, adapting it for ARD might not be an issue or might require a different answerer than the one that can fix the script itself. <comment241167> This might be the checkbox to push the script over the edge, let's get the OP to refine local execution of the script works first before we jump over hoops about ARD ... <comment241406> @kent hey you were right once i ran as root the script ran successfully. I guess the question now is how I can run this script to work. First bmike, do i need a separate thread for the script? The script works and there is an account on the Mac but I cannot login with newly created user. Something up with the script? <comment241599> Hey @bmike kent was correct below with adding "root"...I need help getting the script to work correctly. Should I start a new thread for that? <comment241645> Nah - Just up vote and accept the answer. I'll try to clean up the script formatting here for you. Feel free to edit the post or the answer as needed.
