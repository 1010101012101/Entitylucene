However, using Google Chrome did work, following this same method. <comment260995> If you follow a YouTube link (in the browser) then it does seem to persistently want to open in the YouTube app. However, if you enter `www.youtube.com` directly in the browser's address bar then you do seem to be able to avoid the app and use the "browser" instead. <comment264029> w3d's comment worked for me.
