time for a new battery? MacBook Air 2013 <body> I have a MacBook Air 2013 13''. Specs:  ul listrongMemory/strong: 8 GB 1600 MHz DDR3/li listrongProcessor/strong: 1.7 GHz Intel Core i7/li listrongGraphics/strong: Intel HD Graphics 5000 1536 MB/li listrongBattery cycle count/strong: 756/li listrongOS/strong: MacOS Sierra 10.12.1/li /ul  Never had any issues with this computer, but where I once got 12 hours on a single charge, now I barely get 2-3 hours. No dramatic difference in use or software. iStat menus stays the battery is in "normal" condition, but I am inclined to think otherwise.   Is it time for a new battery?
