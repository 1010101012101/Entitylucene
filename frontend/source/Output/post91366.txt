Mac Mini with Linux <body> I have a Mac Mini (6,1) without an optical drive and I would like to put Debian testing on it instead of OS X. I cannot find a complete and concise guide to doing this on the mac's without the optical drives.  Any ideas?  Thanks  <answer91369> You can download a live or an install disk image and copy it on an USB drive. Just look at these instructions from the Debian installation guide.  For more detailed instructions, read the Ubuntu guide for creating a live stick. The procedure is identical; just do that with the Debian image.  <comment107292> Use a USB stick to boot off.
