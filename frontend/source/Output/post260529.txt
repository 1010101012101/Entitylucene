How to simply add album covers to an iTunes playlist? <body> I would like to create a Playlist folder into which I could put album covers, without showing all the cuts within, since I play a classical recording as an individual entity. This would simplify finding an album without having to wade through all of the movements within a recording.  <answer260531> Create your playlist, then select View As  Albums.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1UXfh.png" alt="enter image description here"
