How to remove launchpad icon of broken application <body> I installed gimp from macports and uninstalled it (codeport uninstall gimp/code) when I found its not well maintained as gimp released its native mac build. But the gimp icon in launchpad didn't go away. How can I force remove the gimp's leftover launchpad icon? I tried moving it to trash and failed. I also tried to wiggle the launchpad icons to click on the 'x' mark but I didn't find 'x' mark on it.

Just open it, select GIMP and ⌘⌫.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0jkJU.png" alt="Launchpad Manager Image"  <comment155098> sqlite3 ~/Library/Application\ Support/Dock/*.db "DELETE from apps WHERE title='APP_NAME';" && killall Dock <comment155101> @Buscar `sqlite3: Error: too many options: "DELETE from apps WHERE title='GIMP';"` <comment155102> @Buscar `$ sqlite3 ~/Library/Application\ Support/Dock/desktoppicture.db SQLite version 3.8.4.3 2014-04-03 16:53:12 Enter ".help" for usage hints. sqlite DELETE from apps WHERE title='GIMP'; Error: no such table: apps'` <comment155103> be careful, you could delete all apps, then you would have to start over (repopulating them) <comment155104> @Buscar ok I don't experiment;ur suggestion didn't work. <comment155106> then your 'GIMP' is called something else, try this http://launchpadmanager.com/features.php <comment155107> or try the 'mdfind gimp' in terminal to find the leftovers. follow those instructions here for manual removal http://www.uninstallapp.org/uninstall-gimp-how-to-remove-gimp-from-mac-os-x
