How to add app icon for iPad Pro in Xcode <body> In Xcode 7.1 and 7.1.1 there is no slot for app icon for iPad Pro. I have no idea how to put in an app icon for iPad Pro.  How can it be done? Does the App Store make the scaled version of the iPad Air app icon onto iPad Pro?   <answer218430> You need strongXcode 7.2 beta 3 or later/strong to add iPad Pro app icons (167 Ã— 167) to asset catalogs.  rdar://22915712  <comment263989> This fits better in Stack Overflow <comment263996> Have you tried the Xcode 7.2 beta ??
