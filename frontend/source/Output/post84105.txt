Where are Mail.app rules stored? They got deleted and I want to restore them <body> Since Mail.app had trouble connecting to the various accounts, I tried to 'reset' it by removing all accounts and the stored passwords in Keychain Access.app. Then I re-added all the mail accounts.  However, for some reason all configured strongrules/strong were deleted too, even though they are not directly tied to a specific mail account.  h3Where are these rules stored so that I can restore them from a time machine backup?/h3  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TA97e.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer84106> The rules are stored in a property list at:  precode~/Library/Mail/V2/MailData/SyncedRules.plist  /code/pre  ol liRestore this file from a backup./li liRestart Mail.app./li liRe-enable the rules. /li /ol  These days check for a V3 folder (El Capitan). Restoring only the codeSyncedRules.plist/code may not work as another .plist file indexes the active state of the current rules set. What worked here was to go back to an earlier version of the code~Library/Mail/V3/MailData/code directory em(note that it is in the V3 directory-- not the V2 directory)/em. This takes a few minutes as Mail has to re-import your messages, but it did restore rules which were not restored by restoring the just the code~/Library/Mail/V3/MailData/SyncedRules.plist/code file only.  <answer250863> I had this problem under Mail V2 (Yosemite).  Deleting codeSyncedRules.plist/code did not workÂ ; the same rules kept coming back when Mail was restarted.  This is due to the rules being synced on iCloud.  To prevent that:  ul liQuit Mail./li liEdit code~/Library/Mail/V2/MailData/SyncedFilesInfo.plist/code and delete the entry corresponding to codeSyncedRules.plist/code. /li liRecover codeSyncedRules.plist/code from your backup./li liRestart Mail and re-enable the rules./li /ul  Your recovered rules should now be there.  -- Charles  <answer275576> Since this stuff gave me a headache, i want to share my personal experience from V4.  Make sure, you delete the codeSynchedRules.plist/code in this directory, too: code~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~mail/Data/V4/SyncedRules.plist/code
