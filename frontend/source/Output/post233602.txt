What happens if you used "rm -rf *" in /Users or /Users/someUser? <body> strongNote: Don't type coderm/code or any variation of it into terminal under any circumstances if you are not experienced with the command line/strong  Does the Mac OS X block you from using coderm/code in those directories to delete a user or delete all the users and do you need to use sudo and put in an administrator password or does it let you without any passwords?   For example if you typed in the following line into terminal would it just completely wipe everything?  precodecd /Users; echo rm -rf * /code/pre  Of course the echo wouldn't be used if you actually wanted the remove command to run.  <answer233603> Yes it will wipe everything and it wont work without the codesudo/code privileges; You can try it in a virtual environment or  you can take a look at this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4fzInlyYQo Have a nice Day !  <answer233604> Two cases:  ul liyou're logged in as strongroot/strong. Everything goes away./li liyou're logged in as a normal user.  All of that user's files go away./li /ul  In some systems, coderm/code is supposed to prompt you if you do this at the "/" level.  Do not count on that prompt.  With emEl Capitan/em, Apple supplies a "prompt" per se, which emby default/em should leave enough of the operating system to boot and recover from your backups.  To see if this has not been disabled, use  precodecsrutil status /code/pre  Further reading:  ul liHow to Disable System Integrity Protection (rootless) in OS X El Capitan/li liRe: Backing up ACL's/li /ul  <comment285459> This is mostly incorrect - SIP doesn't protect anything in /Users - only normal ACL and filesystem separations exist in that part of the filesystem. <comment285460> You can recover the system if your home directory was erased (a little painful, of course). <comment285461> We already have a question on `rm -rf /` in the root directory at http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/174595/stuck-on-blue-screen-after-running-rm-in - let's keep this to what happens when you `rm` in `/Users` directory... <comment285462> Also - please note - the question did have `rm -rf /` in the body so this question was addressing that aspect before being migrated here. We cover `rm` at the root already at http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/174595/stuck-on-blue-screen-after-running-rm-in <comment285463> I've had this conversation before, where it turned out that a minor change of command was sufficient to bypass the prompt.
