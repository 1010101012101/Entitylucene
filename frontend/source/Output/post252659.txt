Applescript : Getting List of Id's of Visible windows ( windows shown on the desktop ) <body> I am trying to get the list of visible windows, i.e the windows which are shown on the desktop and not minimized.  So, far I have this script which gives me the correst list of processes which are running and have a windows associated with it. But I am not able to get the id's of visible windows associated with these processes.  Here's the script :  precodeset visibleWindows to "" set message to ""  tell application "System Events"     set listOfProcesses to (name of every process where background only is false)     repeat with visibleProcess in listOfProcesses         try             tell process visibleProcess to set visibleWindows to visibleWindows &amp; (id of windows whose visible is true)         on error someError             set message to "Some error occured :" &amp; someError         end try     end repeat end tell  return {visibleWindows, listOfProcesses, message} /code/pre  You can try this in script editor but its always giving a empty list.  Any help/suggestions would be much appreciated.  <answer252766> I modified your emcode/em, making the necessary changes for it to at least run em(work)/em through the emcode/em to gather the information, while adding some additional emcode/em to handle the reporting of more then one message by having a separator between them. However, you can change it to something other then what I made it.  That said though, the output for the codevisibleWindows/code is just a string of numbers representing the concatenated codeid/code's, as that's how it's written to output. I'm not sure if that's the output you expected, however if the emcode/em as you wrote it had ran through, the outcome would have been the same for what's returned for codevisibleWindows/code.  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codeon run     set visibleWindows to ""     set message to ""      tell application "System Events"         set listOfProcesses to (name of every process where background only is false)     end tell      repeat with visibleProcess in listOfProcesses         try             tell application visibleProcess to set visibleWindows to visibleWindows &amp; (id of windows whose visible is true)         on error someError             set message to message &amp; "Some error occurred: " &amp; someError &amp; "; "         end try     end repeat      return {visibleWindows, listOfProcesses, message} end run /code/pre  In the emcode/em above, if you change codeset visibleWindows to ""/code to codeset visibleWindows to {}/code, then codevisibleWindows/code returns as a list of the codeid/code's not just a string of numbers.  If you also change:  precodetell application visibleProcess to set visibleWindows to visibleWindows &amp; (id of windows whose visible is true) /code/pre  To:  precodetell application visibleProcess to set visibleWindows to visibleWindows &amp; visibleProcess &amp; (id of windows whose visible is true) /code/pre  You get the application's name followed by a list of its window's codeid/code, so at least the data returned make more sense, then just a string of numbers or a list of codeid/code's not knowing emwhich/em belongs to emwhat/em.  The bottom line is, get the codelistOfProcesses/code separately and then let the emapplication/em not the emprocess/em get the codeid/code and do so outside of the "System Events" codetell/code block. Every combination I tried while leaving the remaining emcode/em within the "System Events" codetell/code block failed. So I moved the rest of it outside of it and changed codetell process/code to codetell application/code and it worked. Then I tweaked the emcode/em it a bit.  <comment314562> It worked great.
