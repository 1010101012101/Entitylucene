Is it possible to sync a folder from Dropbox to iBook in iPad? <body> I want to copy an folder which may contain lots of folders from Dropbox to iBook, and keep the folder hierarchy correct. I used to use GoodReader and works fine, but it crashes a lot under iOS 7.  <answer104724> No, this is not possible since iBooks does not support bulk importing of content from other applications on an iOS device. The three ways to add books to iBooks are:  ul liPurchase from the iBooks store and download/li liSync books through iTunes/li liSend a single book (not several) from another application on the iOS device with the strongOpen In...iBooks/strong option/li /ul  Also, iBooks does not have the concept of folders and folder hierarchies. It does have strongCollections/strong, but there is no way to map folders to strongCollections/strong from iTunes or any other source.  <answer199541> You can try https://chib.me/dropbooks/  It allows you to sync iBooks with any folder on your Mac. You could use it with Dropbox folder.  <comment123178> I'm pretty sure this isn't possible. iBooks just isn't intended to support it. You can create "collections" which are essentially folders, but you can only import one PDF/ePub at time and then you'll need to manually sort them. <comment123212> I cannot include this as part of the answer, but keep an eye out when OS X Mavericks is released. It comes with a built-in iBooks app, and may probably provide the ability to add folders of books into iBooks and sync them to iOS devices.
