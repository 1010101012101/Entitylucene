I Can't raise the brightness to the maximum. <body> I have a macbook pro late 2008. When Im raising the brighntess level, when it reaches the 50% it starts to decrease the brightness till it goes almost dark on 100%. Someone know how to do fix this?  thanks  <answer85457> take a look at your settings! so you dont have automatic brightness on,img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/W6Qtu.png" alt="take a look" that COULD prevent it! "could.." second thing i would do is an SMC reset! if this doesn't work get back and we can to a little more trouble shooting!  <comment98444> Weird. I recommend that you try to reset the SMC.
