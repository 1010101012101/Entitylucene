Changing text navigation buttons in OSX <body> br I'd like to change the default text navigation buttons for OSX (Mountain Lion).br That is, currently the key to move iterate tokens when editing a text file (or in XCode) is alt, and command for BOL/EOL.   I want to edit the default keys such that command is used to iterate through tokens, and either (alt+command+direction) or (fn+direction) is used for BOL/EOL.  I couldn't seem to find it in the key settings of each program, so I suppose it is some sort of default setting of the OS. Where and how can I change to achieve the above behaviour?   Thanks in advance,br Dan  <answer86708> You can create custom key bindings that will apply in most OS X text editors (specifically, those that use the Cocoa framework).  Check out KeyBindingsEditor, which provides a front end to the key bindings system.  Alternatively, you can create a codeDefaultKeyBinding.dict/code plist file in code~/Library/KeyBindings//code that allows you to specify custom keybinding actions. You should read Apple's documentation for the precise actions available.  In your case, you'll probably want the codemoveWordForward:/code and codemoveWordBackward:/code methods, if I'm parsing your question correctly.  <comment100267> Thanks! The KBE GUI did not seem to load, so I've edited the key bindings file myself. I am currently looking for more options rather than moveWordForward and moveWordBackward (Such as, when using both shift and cmd, only a work should be marked etc). <comment100277> I am having some sort of weird issue. After editing the binding of cmd+right, Safari does not input cmd+right as it should've (Forward, Backward web pages). Why is that? <comment100291> It may be that there's an active text field overriding the default behaviour. Make sure there are no active text fields, then try again. <comment100294> There are absolutely no active text fields. Checked it also on sites that have no text fields at all. Any other possible explanation and/or solution?
