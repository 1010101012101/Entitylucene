How to limit cpu frequency in OS X? <body> The OS X kernel does control this directly since below 5% my CPU gets locked to 1.2GHz instead of the normal 3.7GHz so there has to be a way to control the CPU speed.  I am aware of this question (Limit processor speed like in Windows) which claimed it to be impossible but after noticing that OS X does control your cpu speed directly depending on battery power I find it hard to believe it's impossible.  So is there any hidden kext and/or kernel call to control the cpu speed? Forwarding me to kernel documentation so I can write my own app is an option as well.  <answer130660> I found this for your reading pleasure:  Mavericks: Native CPU/IGPU Power Management     Native Mavericks power management delivers the best combination of   processor and graphics performance and efficiency. The ingredients are   an installed processor specific power management ssdt, a compatible   system definition and the native power management kext. Native   Mavericks power management does not require specific BIOS settings or   anything more than one boot setting to load the power management ssdt.   Credit for the technique described to PikeRAlpha.      What changed between Mountain Lion and Mavericks power management? The   existing processor frequency/power state reporting tools (i.e.,   MSRDumper, HWMonitor) stopped reporting power states between idle and   max non turbo. This led to an incorrect conclusion that native   Mavericks power management was not working. A new tool, Intel Power   Gadget, shows Mavericks power management is working as designed.      To be clear, native Mavericks power management is not mandatory. The   consequences are not severe. Performance is similar, however, higher   temps (~10 C), more power (5-10 W) and sleep problems are likely.

Check the answers there, it answers your question. <comment153287> @chillin: it doesn't answer my question, my question is "How to limit" not whether it's possible or not so if it's impossible than that's not an answer. <comment153288> Very nice, I'll check it out (but I'll have to upgrade to Mavericks first) <comment160154> Answers should be selfcontained and not just links.
