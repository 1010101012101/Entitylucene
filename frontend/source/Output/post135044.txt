using external hdd slows down my mac <body> When I use an external drive via usb, my computer really slows down giving me no choice except reboot.   I watched memory usage with activity monitor. Free memory decreases by time and inactive memory increases with the same amount and others don't change much. If I continue using -esp. reading-, free memory comes below to 100MB and then increases a bit -I think it starts paging =other applications' memories= to system disk-, then continues to decrease. Closing the application -that use the external- do not relese memory from inactive to free but ejecting the external does. After unplugging and trying to use the other applications, I face very sluggish performance so that rebooting becomes a better-fast choice. Both NTFS and FAT partitions produce the same result and I don't have any other partition.  If I try to re-read the same file after the external drive stops spinning (sleeps), it does not start spinning but trying to read another file makes it start spining. This makes me think about some -overdone- caching problem, but don't know what causes it and how to turn it off (Tuxero's caching is already disabled in the preferences, although I think it is only for writing only).  I made some research and found nothing specific; they tell to reinstall the os or format the drive -to HFS+ -. What is causing this?  Note: All of my drives are in Spotlight's exclusion (privacy) list and using another usb slot did not change a thing.

It's very process intensive. I simply remove my external drives from the Spotlight index.  System Preferences  Spotlight  Privacy  and add your drive to the list of devices Spotlight should ignore.  http://support.apple.com/kb/PH14049  Apparently, you can also create a file called "code.metadata_never_index/code" on your disk and this will do the trick as well. I've never done it this way. YMMV.  https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5486948  You can do this from the terminal by keying  precodetouch "/Volumes/Your Volume Name/.metadata_never_index" /code/pre  Or by simply creating a blank file and renaming it that.  <comment160029> All of my drives are in Spotlight's exclusion (privacy) list; I forgot to mention, sorry! <comment160030> @Abuzettin.H I've not experienced anything like this, then. You get the same result using different USB ports on the machine? I likely can't help you beyond that post, which I'll probably delete. <comment160033> Using another usb slot did not change a thing, sorry! <comment160040> Have you tried safe mode to see if the problem persists? Just this morning I saw that Google Drive was causing problems with my new install of Mavericks and causing Finder to crash. You're using FUSE to read the drive? <comment160047> OSXFuse is for Truecrypt, nothing should be using it to read and it also happens in FAT drives (native driver). I will try safe mode -rebooting once in a safe mode, then in normal without doing anything- but I don't -sense to- expect any benefit from it :(. <comment160048> You've tried an HFS+ USB disk? <comment160049> No, I don't have any. <comment160050> If you have a thumbdrive or something else formatted FAT, maybe test and see if you can replicate the problem with a smaller disk. How many external drives are we talking about here? More than a few so that it's unlikely a hardware issue? <comment160111> Did not work. After some research, the question evolved into [this](https://superuser.com/questions/769107/osx-does-not-release-extarnal-disk-cache-in-inactive-memory). <comment160113> Well, that does tell a somewhat different story. <comment188579> I believe excluding the external-hdd from spotlight prevented the rainbow ball / wake from sleep issues for me, for some reason macos woke up the hdd on each file selection window, but no more
