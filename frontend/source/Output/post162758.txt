How do I mask "forbidden" chars in passwords in the mount command? <body> How do I properly mask/escape illegal characters like /:@\ in passwords added in the mount command?  The question arose in the answer here:  precodemount -t afp afp://adminname:password@ServerIPAddress/ShareName /Volumes/TimeMachine /code/pre  The asking person had a backslash "\" in the password and the command didn't work. The solution were single quotes around the codeafp.../code-part.    Testing the whole scenario in a VM, I created an admin with a password similar to codeaaaaa\@11111/code, but I haven't been able to get the mount command working.  <answer162818> Use URL encoding to protect the wonky characters in the password. Essentially each character (or byte of UTF-8) can be encoded as a code%/code followed by two hex digits specifying the encoded byte. In your example, code\/code - code%5C/code and code@/code - code%40/code:  precodemount -t afp afp://adminname:aaaaa%5C%4011111@ServerIPAddress/ShareName /Volumes/TimeMachine /code/pre  This worked in my test.
