imessages and read receipts <body> In what situations will a message just say delivered but not read? Like if they blocked you number or deleted all messages before opening it. things along those lines?  <answer173854> Other than they didn't actually open it yet - reading on the lock screen doesn't tag it as read - most likely is they switched off Read Receipts for some paranoid reason.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4SWEF.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Either that or you're blocked - there's no way to tell that, unless you ring them &amp; get bounced straight to voicemail every timeâ€¦ though their phone could be off.    Blocked messages are sent &amp; arrive at the receiver's phone, but are just never shown to them, so as far as the system &amp; carrier is concerned, everything went as planned.br Voice calls might ring once, then go to voicemail; depends how quickly the phone reacts to the block. Again, as far as the system &amp; carrier is concerned, everything happened as it should.  Last option, they sold their iPhone, bought a droid, &amp; forgot to switch off iMessage. [long shot]  <comment204580> I don't know about blocked (those are probably not even delivered) but otherwise it would be any situation in which the text is not read by tapping on your conversation.
