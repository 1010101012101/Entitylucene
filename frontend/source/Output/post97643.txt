Does a mac support UAS (USB Attached SCSI)? <body> Does a mac with USB 3.0 support UAS (USB Attached SCSI)? If it does, how can we enable it in OS X and bootcamp? I need better speeds for my external RAID.  <answer97644> Apparently what you need is already in Lion see this blog OSX Mountain Lion 10.8 UAS UASP USB Attach SCSI drivers  Note I have nothing to do with the blog.  It was at the top of the list when I stronggoogled USB Attached SCSI OSX/strong  <comment114583> How about bootcamp? I use bootcamp quite a lot. <comment114587> @jw382 It depends on the version of Windows you are using. <comment114593> Windows 8 Professional <comment114594> @jw382 That is supported in W8 .. so it comes down to what hardware you are running it all on. <comment114597> Do I need a specific driver to enable the feature? It seems that I don't have the USB attached SCSI driver under storage controllers in device management.
