iMac G5 works very loudly. How to fix it? <body> I only run Safari with maximum 3-5 tabs opened and the machine makes noise like a vacuum cleaner making it very hard to work on. Any ideas how to fix it?  <answer99690> If you think that the fans are running at a higher speed that they should, you could try reseting the SMU.  If the issue is just with the sound being too loud, then the best option would be to open the computer and clean the dust, mainly from the fans and the ventilation-related. Even more, overheat could have caused the fans to emslightly/em bend, making some emannoying/em noises. If that is the case, the only option would be to replace it with a new one. Replacing the thermal grease could be helpful too, if you've got overheating issues.
