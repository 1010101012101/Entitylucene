Position of the configuration files of TexMaker <body> Someone could provide information about the position inside the pc of the configuration files for the application TeXMaker. I can't find any file in the home directory.   More precisely, I'm looking for the code.ini/code file in order to make permanent changes in the path.  <answer214953> The codetexmaker.ini/code file is created in the user's home and it's stored in:  precode~/.config/xm1 /code/pre  If I do  precodels ~/.config/xm1/ /code/pre  the result is  precodetexmaker.ini        texmakerapp.ini /code/pre  <answer247754> A easy way to access your .ini file in texmaker optionsmanage settings filesave a copy  This creates a .ini file and allows you to save it anywhere you like. You can then manipulate this file use this page page as reference copying and pasting which is what I did. Make sure you only use texmaker code if config texmaker and texstudio if texstudio.  From there optionsmanage settings filereplace settings file by new one (one that you manipulated)  Hope this helps!  <comment255515> if you want to find files related to TexMaker, run `sudo /usr/libexec/locate.updatedb` to update your locate database and run `locate TexMaker` to find the files related to your program (it won't show all of them but most)
