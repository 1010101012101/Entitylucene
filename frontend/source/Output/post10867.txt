Where is the SafariStand menu/preferences? <body> Inspired by this answer I installed SafariStand (after installing SIMBAL) (following instrtuctions in the read me file      strongHow To Install/strongbr   - Install SIMBL 0.9.5 or later http://culater.net/software/SIMBL/SIMBL.phpbr   - Quit Safari.br   - move "SafariStand.bundle" into your SIMBL plugin folder.br   - Result path is "/Library/Application Support/SIMBL/Plugins/SafariStand.bundle".     and also in this website)  Now that the installation is done, I am unable to see the menu/icon of SafariStand There is not much documentation anywhere.  Where/how do I see the SafariStand settings window?  <answer10911> Look for the "Stand" menu to appear between the "Window" and "Help" menus in your top menu bar.   <comment11422> It doesn't. Let me try re installing... <comment11473> What happened when you reinstalled? Is everything else up to date? <comment11695> (thanks for asking) Reinstallation worked. Looks like I did something wrong when I installed first. Able to see the stand menu.
