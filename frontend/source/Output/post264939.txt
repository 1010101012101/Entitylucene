Unable to boot Windows 10 after creating new partition with Disk Utility <body> I own a MacBook Pro Mid 2012 with macOS Sierra on it. I installed Windows 10 using Boot Camp. Everything had worked out fine until I created a new partition with Disk Utility on macOS. Now I am unable to boot Windows 10. I tried the following:  ul liI booted my Mac with Option key pressed to choose the operating system but Windows 10 does not appear anymore./li liI booted macOS Sierra and changed the boot volume to Windows 10. After restarting I get the error: No bootable device - insert boot disc and press any key/li /ul  I read a lot about macOS GPT and the hybrid MBR used by Boot Camp to enable booting Windows on a Mac. The problem seems to be that I modified the GPT with Disk Utility and now the hybrid MBR is not in sync with the GPT anymore.  If I run gdisk, I get the following output:  precode$ sudo gdisk /dev/disk0 Password: GPT fdisk (gdisk) version 1.0.1  Warning: Devices opened with shared lock will not have their partition table automatically reloaded! NOTE: Write test failed with error number 1. It will be impossible to save changes to this disk's partition table! You may need to deactivate System Integrity Protection to use this program.

Partition table scan:   MBR: hybrid   BSD: not present   APM: not present   GPT: present  Found valid GPT with hybrid MBR; using GPT. /code/pre  If I press codep/code, I get the following output:  precodeCommand (? for help): p Disk /dev/disk0: 488397168 sectors, 232.9 GiB Logical sector size: 512 bytes Disk identifier (GUID): 48433EF7-590E-4ECF-9003-9B760258F269 Partition table holds up to 128 entries First usable sector is 34, last usable sector is 488397134 Partitions will be aligned on 8-sector boundaries Total free space is 262485 sectors (128.2 MiB)  Number  Start (sector)    End (sector)  Size       Code  Name    1              40          409639   200.0 MiB   EF00  EFI System Partition    2          409640       312909639   149.0 GiB   AF00    3       312909640       314179175   619.9 MiB   AB00    4       314179176       331886591   8.4 GiB     0700    5       332148736       488396799   74.5 GiB    0700 /code/pre  Is there a way to synchronize my GPT and my hybrid MBR to make Windows 10 bootable again? There are already answers to related questions but, if possible, the solution should not involve rEFInd/ rEFIt and/or a Windows 10 recovery usb stick.  Thanks for your help.
