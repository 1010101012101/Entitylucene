Clean install of Snow Leopard will not load <body> I had recently installed Google Drive on my 13" Macbook Pro running Snow Leopard 10.6.8   It was crashing my computer to the point where it wouldnt load at all, so it was suggested to me to go into single user mode, mount the drive and delete it using  rm -rf /Applications/Google\ Drive.app  My fingers were moving too fast in my frustrations and i think i may have deleted the whole library because it was a good 30 minutes of files being deleted. I have everything backed up.   I tried reinstalling Snow Leopard from scratch with my install disc. Now it wont load past the welcome screen where I have to choose my language.   Does anyone have any suggestions as what to do? Perhaps I deleted something that was crucial in single user mode.
