How do I switch between corresponding .h or .c/.m files in Xcode 4? <body> In Xcode 3 I could click a button in the top-right corner of the code editor to switch between header and implementation (.c or .m) files. Now in Xcode 4 there is no button like this around the editor. This would be even more useful now than it was with Xcode 3, because I'd like to click a class in the Symbol view to pull up the relevant .h file, then click a button or keyboard shortcut and get to the .m file.  <answer12159> See this Stack Overflow answer.  "Ctrl+Cmd+Up or Down, but the shortcut seems a bit finicky and sometimes stops working, not yet sure when and why."  <answer12162> three finger swipe up &amp; down, I'm loving this!  strongEDIT/strong: ermm, isnt a bit offtopic and should be asked in SO?  <comment12691> It is a question about Apple software. It's not really about the code aspect of programming, so I think it's OK here. It would probably also be at home on StackOverflow. <comment12710> Hmm... it seems to work in project or symbol view, unless you're in symbol view and clicked on a protocol. Thanks
