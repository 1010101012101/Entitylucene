Recover Yahoo password MacBookPro or iPhone4 <body> Few months ago I received an email from Yahoo saying there was an unexpected sign-in attempt to my email. They suggested to change the password and to update my account recovery information. I did change the password but did not change the recovery info. In the meantime I forgot my password, the security questions are not the ones I have chosen so obviously have no answers to them and have no recovery email.  On my MacBook I am logged in to yahoo mail (using Chrome) as I have ticked off the box Stay signed in, on my iPhone the password is also saved. But I can not login on a new device. Is there a way to find out the password on any of these two devices?  When I check the saved passwords on MacBook in Chrome under settings and try to use it (it's 9 digits) on other device it says the password is incorrect. When I check the mail settings on iPhone it shows only 8 dots.   Please HELP!
