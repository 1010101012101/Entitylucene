How to add MySQL to $PATH variable to resolve "mysql: command not found"? <body> I installed MySQL on my Mac, and now I would like to add it to my code$PATH/code variable. I want to be able to type codemysql/code anywhere.  I tried adding the following to my code.profile/code file:  precodeexport PATH=${PATH}/usr/local/mysql/bin/ /code/pre  I have restarted my Terminal but it does not do the trick. It still says: code-bash: mysql: command not found/code.  How can I add this properly to my code$PATH/code?  I am using OS X Yosemite.  <answer176802> Try adding the following line to your code.bash_profile/code file.  precodeexport PATH="/usr/local/mysql/bin:$PATH" /code/pre  You can do this easily with the following command, which will append the line if the file already exists or create a new file with the line if it doesn't.  precodeecho 'export PATH="/usr/local/mysql/bin:$PATH"' &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile /code/pre  <answer176805> Here is why your current code is not working:  precodeexport PATH=${PATH}/usr/local/mysql/bin/ /code/pre  You forgot the colon.  precodeexport PATH=${PATH}:/usr/local/mysql/bin/ /code/pre  is the correct code.  <answer177864> You can also use an alias to do things like setting username and database.  In .bash_profile ( just .profile on some systems )  precodealias mysql='/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql -u username --default-character-set=utf8' -p databasename /code/pre  logout and open a new terminal or it won't get setup  Now typing codemysql/code will ask for your database password and take you straight there, instead of fiddling with the options each time.  <answer213272> You can accomplish this by going to your .bash_profile file and adding these lines to it.  precodealias mysql.start="sudo /usr/local/mysql/support-files/mysql.server start" alias mysql.stop="sudo /usr/local/mysql/support-files/mysql.server stop" alias mysql.restart="sudo /usr/local/mysql/support-files/mysql.server restart" alias mysql.status="sudo /usr/local/mysql/support-files/mysql.server status" /code/pre  After you've done this you can start, stop, restart and check the status of your connection anywhere in your terminal like this:  precodemysql.start - starts mysql mysql.stop - stop mysql mysql.restart - restarts mysql mysql.status - checks the status of mysql /code/pre  Hope that helps even tho I might be late. CHEERS!  <answer213278> edit the system wide configuration file:  precode/etc/paths /code/pre  <comment257502> This file gets overwritten by every OS X upgrade. <comment305415> People upvoting, where did you get this faulty path from?
