My Desktop folder was "wiped" <body> about 3 days ago, after turning on my mac, I noticed that all the folders and files that were in the Desktop folder were just gone. I considered the (highly unlikely) possibility of accidentally deleting them myself, but:br  1. The custom icon I had assigned to the Desktop folder is gone too;br  2. The missing contents are not in the trash, unlike other (older) files;    Also, a spotlight search can't find the files, and the're also apparently not hidden (codels -la/code inside code~//code reveals nothing unusual).  I also tried running Disk Drill, which scanned my entire SSD and naturally found a lot of deleted files, but not emthese/em ones.  No one else has access to my computer.br It's a retina MBP (late 2012) running OS X 10.9.5 (Mavericks).  I hope someone can shed some light on this issue :)br Thanks!  <comment177588> Do a Finder `Get Info` on your desktop. When was it created? Is it possible that something moved it to a different location, and OS X created an empty one when you logged in?
