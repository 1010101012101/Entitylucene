Shift-Option-<key> is adding accented characters <body> On El Capitan (10.11.4) I somehow got into a state where using the key combination kbdshift/kbd+kbdoption/kbd+kbdkey/kbd outputs accented or special characters.  For example     kbdshift/kbd+kbdoption/kbd+kbdk/kbd :       kbdshift/kbd+kbdoption/kbd+kbdj/kbd : Ô   I have those key combos mapped to some useful commands in my text editor (RubyMine/IntelliJ), but instead of those commands working, I now just get the special character input.  I assume it must be a built in OS X option (I've tried various keyboards) but I can't find any way to disable it.   Any ideas?  <answer241843> In order to avoid accented characters you need to create and use a custom keylayout file.

Perhaps the Karabiner app can override that. <comment297242> It turns out that you need to create a custom keylayout in order to disable this.
