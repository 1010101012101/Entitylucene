MacBook Pro has to recover from Safe Sleep after 50% of all sleeps, although power is connected <body> When I wake my MacBook Pro from sleep it sometimes has to recover from Safe Sleep, even though the power is connected.  I have installed 16 GB (2x8) RAM myself on my MacBook, however 8 GB is the max supported RAM.  Could this be why it fails to wake from sleep quickly?  Is there an error log stating why it had to recover from Safe Sleep?  By recovering from Safe Sleep I mean this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hXBYP.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  codepmset -g/code:  pre Active Profiles: Battery Power       -1 AC Power        -1* Currently in use:  standbydelay         4200  standby              0  womp                 1  halfdim              1  hibernatefile        /var/vm/sleepimage  sms                  1  networkoversleep     0  disksleep            10  sleep                0 (sleep prevented by )  autopoweroffdelay    14400  hibernatemode        3  autopoweroff         1  ttyskeepawake        1  displaysleep         5  acwake               0  lidwake              1 /pre  <answer94621> Apple says the reason is to comply with the European Energy Standards.  It looks like you can modify the behavior with some commandline-fu:  precodesudo pmset -a autopoweroffdelay 86400 /code/pre  will send your MacBook Pro to safe sleep after 24 hours instead of the default 4 hours.
