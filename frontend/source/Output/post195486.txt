Google Calendar - iPad compatibility <body> I'm trying to install Google Calendar app on my IPad Air 2.  Couldn't find it in App Store on my IPad. So I found it on a web page https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-calendar/id909319292?mt=8 then I sent this link to my IPad and App Store installed it on IPad but... It was installed like for IPhone, everything was big and huge so i had to remove it.  It looks like there's no Google Calendar app for IPad. Am I right?  How to install Google Calendar on IPad?  <answer195488> There's no separate iPad version, no.  The iTunes Store Page you linked says compatible with iPad, but optimised for iPhone.br That's likely to mean it works, but won't look great.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Wv7o7.png" alt="enter image description here"
