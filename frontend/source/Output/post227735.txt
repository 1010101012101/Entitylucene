How to Show Virtual Keyboard in El Capitan? <body> I changed to El Capitan and I cannot find anymore the virtual keyboard about testing keyboard's keys visually.  It is normally in the right hand corner under the keyboard switcher icon.  I need the tool to review specific characters of OS X Keyboards, since I am typing many of them.   How can you have the virtual keyboard in OS X El Capitan?  <answer227736> System Prefs  Keyboard  Keyboard  Show Keyboard, Emoji &amp; Symbol viewers in menu bar.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1zT5p.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment277573> Thank you! I wonder why they added the word *Emoji* in El Capitan because it confused me. <comment277575> I'd make grand sweeping comments about Apple becoming a *"lifestyle product for the type-with-your-thumbs generation"* & forgetting its old user-baseâ€¦ but someone would complain ;)
