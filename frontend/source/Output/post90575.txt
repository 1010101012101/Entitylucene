What is the market share of iPhone(all versions) vs iPad (all versions)? <body> Is there any recent market research available about iPhone vs iPad share in the market? I have found lots of comparison charts which are cross-platform (iOS vs Android etc) but not within the iOS and which device type holds what %page of market. I would be thankful if anybody could help me with that.   Thanks  <answer90577> Here are some numbers for the fiscal year ending in September 2012.

I think you need to reword the title though. "Market share" doesn't apply across devices. Market share is what you compare between competing devices/manufacturers in a vertical segment. What you're asking for is sales volume by iPhone vs iPad. You may find better luck with a properly worded request. And I think this can be answered reasonably accurately by looking through past Apple keynote talks from WWDC -- they usually have sales volume numbers in those. <comment106319> Not sure if Apple publishes such numbers, but you can look up in they annual reports. Unless you do mean Market share than specify, world wide and/or against which competitive product. <comment106452> Many many thanks - I wish I could offer you a box of chocolates for the support. <comment106459> @Salman You are welcome, and you did express your thankfulness by Voting up my answer. However, for a box of chocolates, I would work like a slave :)
