How to change the default folder viewed when finder is opened <body> i just downloaded OS 10.9.2 after having 10.6.8 for the last few years. In 10.6.8, whenever I clicked on finder in the dock, I would get a finder window with the "user" folder opened immediately. in 10.9, this opens the "all my files" folder. Is there a way to change it back so that whenever I click on finder it, by default, opens to the user folder?  <answer129187> Go to Finder â†’ Preferences and change the default folder:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kBK7r.png" width="298"  <comment151215> wow that was easy - thanks
