Maximum number of Airport Expresses/Home Audio Distribution Network <body> I'm trying to set up a 6-zone home music distribution system using 6 AE's, each one being connected to a number of speakers thru multi-channel distribution amps.  All would be located in my central "A/V distribution stack" and could be wifi'd to a dedicated MacBook in the stack running iTunes and containing all of my music (or maybe wired to the MacBook, although I don't know how to do this...)  I love the Apple Remote App for its simplicity and ability to access my itunes playlists, select multiple AE's (=zones in my case), and control their volume individually - all from my iPhone.  My wife and I each have a MBPro that would also be on the network for internet access and printing.  My problem is that our 2 printers are in locations where they cannot be easily wired to the MBPro's or the AE's in the A/V distribution stack, as well as a larger house that might also need 1-2 more Wifi relays/remotes to make sure wifi is available throughout.  I have read that 6 AE's is the limit (although it wasn't clear if the limit applies to wired AE's), and I need the first 6 for the music distribution.  I've thought about setting up a second wifi network for the 2 MBPro's and the printers, but if I did, I'd still need for BOTH wifi networks to have internet access, and I'm not sure if this is possible from one cable modem.  This would also mean that the 2 MBPro's wouldn't be able to play music over the house audio system - somewhat less than optimal.  I would greatly appreciate any suggestions or advice.  Thank you.
