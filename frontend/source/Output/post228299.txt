How can I prevent "Reset network settings" on my iPhone from affecting my Laptop? <body> I just hit reset network settings on my iPhone (9.2.1) because I was unable to make phone calls.   I then noticed that my OSX (10.11.3) lost its internet connection.  I immediately checked the keychain (where all wifi passwords are stored) and noticed that all passwords are missing.  I can only assume that resetting the iPhone "network settings" also affected my mac.  I assume this occurred through iCloud.   strongQuestion/strong  ul liHow can I get those Wifi Passwords back?/li liHow can I prevent this from happening again?/li /ul  <answer228658> Check to seen if your passwords still exist under codeSafari &gt; Preferences &gt; Passwords/code on your Mac. Maybe they are still there.  If this doesn't work, try the following: Unplug your router's ethernet cable (so that iCloud cannot sync with the server) and try to restore your from Time Machine. This should revert your Key Chain. I recommend disconnecting your router because if you just turn off your wifi, it will probably turn back on after the restore is done and sync with iCloud again.  <answer254244> I don't know how to prevent it from happening, but I fixed it last time by getting a copy of my keychain via TimeMachine and reimporting them.  <answer285474> Check to seen if your passwords still exist under Safari  Preferences  Passwords on your Mac.

Since then I have been keeping a backup of my passwords in a text file on an encrypted drive. <comment357655> I might have the answer to your second question: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/283657/1898
