Can I fix a scratched iPhone 5 rear camera lens? <body> In a picture I took this afternoon with my iPhone 5 I noticed a purple line on the photo:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nY2xO.jpg" alt="image of purple line on photo"  At first I thought it was a software issue so I rebooted the phone. Unfortunately, after a reboot the line was still there on new photographs.  Upon closer examination it appears that the rear lens of my iPhone 5 has somehow become scratched. Is there a way to fix this? Or do I need to just have the phone replaced?  <answer91842> Well i think you can do it  Lens - http://www.witrigs.com/replacement-camera-lens-for-iphone-5  Video on stronghowto/strong do it - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Si0M3wak4Q0  <answer92020> don’t do it your self at first! go to an Apple Store and let it check, maybe it’s just a hair!  <answer130090> Yes, you can replace the camera lens, but it is difficult. The camera lens is cheap. But it takes much time to replace the scratched one:  ul liTear down the front LCD screen/li liTear down all the small parts, battery, motherboard, dock flex cable, and camera etc/li liUse a heat gun to heat the camera lens, use something to make the lens out/li liUse Glue to glue to new lens on the original position of the back housing/li /ul  <comment121477> It ultimately was just a hair that moved off the lens on its own. <comment152352> Please check out iFixit ;) <comment152353> Maybe late, but how did you manage to fix your problem?
