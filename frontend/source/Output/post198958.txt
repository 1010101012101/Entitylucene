Boot Failed. EFI DVD/CDROM <body> I am trying to install El Capitan emPublic/em beta version (available here) in Parallels Desktop version 10.2.2.  I followed this tutorial to create the bootable dmg and mounted it in a new VM that I created.  When I start the VM it says...  precodeBoot Failed. EFI Hard Drive Boot Failed. EFI DVD/CDROM /code/pre  ...and then falls to EFI Shell as shown below.  Any ideas on how to fix this?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QbNlm.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer213117> Visit this link:  http://kb.parallels.com/en/5029  Follow the instructions on how to remove a virtual machine.  Once you do this, then you will be returned to the screen where you first started.  I remember what got me into this mess was choosing the setting where I could do the Custom settings.  DO NOT check this setting and everything will be fine.  I was able to get Windows 10 to install.  All is well now.  I hope this helps.  <answer222319> It didn't work for me too. And looking for options I found this which works better with VMWare Fusion 8 on Mac.  It is a shell script which with just one command create a Bootable DMG file and then you can create a Virtual Machine from that DMG and that's it.  https://github.com/rtrouton/create_os_x_vm_install_dmg  ul liWhat I did is to uncompress the file found at codecreate_os_x_vm_install_dmg-master/support/First_Boot_Package_Install.zip/code/li liThe correct command that works for me was codesudo ./create_vmware_osx_install_dmg.sh "/Applications/Install OS X El Capitan.app" /Users/[your_user]/Desktop//code/li /ul  I hope it could be useful for you like me! Any question ask me at @Lexynux  <comment238260> The [Parallels Desktop for Mac - Forum](https://forum.parallels.com/forums/parallels-desktop-for-mac.58/) is probably a better place to be asking questions regarding Parallels Desktop for Mac. <comment238352> @user3439894 good point.  I created a new thread at https://forum.parallels.com/threads/os-x-el-capitan-boot-failed-efi-dvd-cdrom.329110/  I will answer this question if/when I get a response there. <comment257671> Thanks, @Rey.  I ended up installing Yosemite and then upgrading to El Capitan.
