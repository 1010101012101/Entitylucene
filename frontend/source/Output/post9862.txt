It is possible to use iPhone as BT headset for the computer? <body> I would like to use my iPhone as an BT headset, is it possible to pair it with the computer and to have it used for computer calls?  <answer10043> Natively no, the iPhone is limited to what is parable to it, and the functions once it is paired.. With a jailbroken iPhone there may be some third party software out there.  <comment10534> Do you have some app names? <comment10609> Not sure, but what ever it is, it would involve "BTStack" which is a custom BlueTooth driver written for the iPhone with less restrictions then the built in iPhone driver.
