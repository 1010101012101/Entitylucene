iPhone 7+ text message with no contact or text but location is on? <body> Browsing through my strongMessages/strong on my iPhone 7+, I recently found a thread with no name, no number, and no message body. However when I click the strongⓘ/strong in the top right corner, I get the options to strongSend My Current Location/strong and strongStop Sharing My Location/strong.  I do not currently have my location shared with anyone, and seeing strongStop Sharing My Location/strong is a little scary.  Has this happened to anyone? What would cause this? Thanks for the help!  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Tvrij.jpg" width="280"  hr  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ldxda.png" width="280"  hr  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bzWoK.png" width="280"   <answer284645> This could be a corrupted strongMessages/strong database. If you have your texts set to expire after a certain amount of time (under strongSettings/strong → strongMessages/strong → strongKeep Messages/strong), your message threads would normally get emptied out, although the number would remain at the top.  You can find out for certain whether you’re sharing your location with anybody by going into strongSettings/strong → strongPersonal Profile/strong (at the very top) → strongiCloud/strong → strongShare My Location/strong. If the list there is empty you should be fine, though you might still want to strongStop Sharing My Location/strong to see if an error/change occurs.  The strongPersonal Profile/strong submenu exists in iOS 10.3 and later. Otherwise just directly scroll down to strongiCloud/strong after opening strongSettings/strong.
