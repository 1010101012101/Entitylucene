How can I show again the text next to "Computer" in Finder? Only the icon shows <body> Somehow in my Finder's sidebar the "Computer" element under devices doesn't show any description text anymore. It won't kill me, but it's annoying.  Does anyone know how to fix it? I couldn't find the right Google keywords.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/umS8s.png" alt="My Finder&#39;s sidebar"  <answer142392> Try going into System Preferences, then Sharing.  At the top of the window should be a field labeled "Computer Name".  Type in what you want and it should correspond with what you see in Finder's Sidebar.  <comment167753> What do you see if you either open `terminal` and type `hostname`, or go to System Preferences - Sharing and look at the Computer Name field? <comment167762> Oops, I didn't notice Mikey T.K.'s earlier comment.  If this works, then he gets the credit.
