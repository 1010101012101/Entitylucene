MacBook taking a long time to wake from sleep after Sierra <body> strongRetina MacBook Pro takes a long time to wake from sleep, MacBook Pro: long time to wake from sleep, what could it be?, and Takes a long time for my macbook pro to wake from sleep do not answer my question./strong  I have experienced multiple slow-downs of waking from sleep on my MacBook (Retina, 12-inch, Early 2016) running macOS Sierra 10.12.1 (16B2555).  This is the usual dock I have. It's pretty much the default, but I always have Terminal, Discord Canary, TextEdit, and Google Chrome open.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QeUzS.png" alt="My dock when this happens"  Here's a detailed rundown of the versions of the apps and what I'm doing with them:  ul liTerminal  ul liVersion 2.7.1 (387)/li liIs running a Node.js command almost all the time/li /ul/li liDiscord Canary  ul liVersion 0.0.136 (0.0.136)/li liUsed to chat with other gamers/li liSimilar to Skype/li liLatest beta build/li /ul/li liTextEdit  ul liVersion 1.12 (329)/li liUsed to edit multiple Node.js files/li /ul/li liGoogle Chrome  ul liVersion 54.0.2840.98 (64-bit)/li liUsed to browse the web/li liIs my main browser./li /ul/li /ul  In case this is relevant, I recently changed my settings to never sleep on a timer. It only sleeps when the lid of my MacBook is shut.  Anyways, now we can get into the actual problem. My screen turns on, but doesn't have any content. After about 40 seconds, my MacBook is usable.  <answer261899> Have you tried resetting your System Management Controller?

(Basically - if you do less at sleep / wake / log in time - does the system respond well?) <comment328252> I have already reset NVRAM. I'm going to reset SMC now. (**Edit:** I reset my SMC and I'll try to reproduce the problem. I will tell you the results soon.) <comment328439> How did the SMC reset go? <comment346209> I've got the same problem.  It happens on both my macbook pro and my mac mini. <comment346213> It didn't work.
