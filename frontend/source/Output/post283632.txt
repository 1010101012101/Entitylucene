2 photos won't appear in iPhoto library, but do appear in Photo Stream <body> System:  Mac Mini running OSX Mavericks, latest iPhoto for that OS, latest updates etc.  Not using iCloud Photo Library.  This is my partner's machine, she just went to offload pictures from her iPhone like she normally would.  After, she noticed that 2 photos in particular did not get transferred over.  iPhoto insists that the photos have already been downloaded from the phone, but they simply are not in the library anywhere.  On further examination, I noticed that they HAD been pulled into her Photo Stream, and when I right click one of them and choose "Show in Library", iPhoto takes me to where the photos SHOULD be (right next to the others that were just imported), but the photos in question are not there.  It's as if iPhoto believes they are there, but they are invisible to the user.  Have rebooted just in case but nothing changed.  I'm sure I can just copy the images over from Photo Stream, but I'm concerned about what's happening here, and that photos could accidentally be lost if she were to not catch that they didn't transfer.  Anyone have any ideas as to what's going on here?
