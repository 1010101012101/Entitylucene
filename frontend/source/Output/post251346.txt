How to make double click on titlebar maximize a window to fill up screen? <body> I hide my dock. How do I acheive this: strongdouble click on titlebar to maximize a window to fill up screen?/strong  Please pay attention to two red rectangles (not fill up the screen though I double click on titlebar) as shown below a screenshot of the entire screen.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/l5yYr.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  This post How to maximise a window to fill up screen in Mavericks? proposes to use SizeUp (PS: it is not free?) by assigning a new shortcut. Is it still possible to use double click?  <answer251351> BetterSnapTool has the option that you're requesting. (The drop-down has many options including maximize.) You can also change the behavior of the green zoom button to do this as well.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/O3ieG.png" alt="BetterSnapTool preferences"  <comment312374> Possible duplicate of [How to maximise a window to fill up screen in Mavericks?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/115895/how-to-maximise-a-window-to-fill-up-screen-in-mavericks) While the question is from Mavericks, the best suggestions (BetterTouchTool and SizeUp) remain the same. <comment312378> @tubedogg, I refer to this post in my updated question. <comment312379> In your post you said "_Please pay attention to two red rectangles as shown below a screenshot of the entire screen._", so exactly why are we supposed to be paying attention to the red rectangles? <comment312381> @user3439894, thx, just updated my question. The two red rectangles indicate that the app does not fill up the screen though I double click on titlebar. <comment312748> It is not free:-( <comment320269> @sparkandshine No, but if you purchase a license for BetterTouchTool, you get a free license for BetterSnapTool (and most of its functionality has been integrated into BTT anyway), and BTT has a pay-what-you-want model that starts at $4.50.
