Can Anyone Identify This Icon <body> I noticed this icon next to my clock a couple days ago:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/llHNg.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MM5o7.png" alt="enter image description here"  I thought it might be related to Microsoft SkyDrive, but that is a different icon.    Any ideas what program that came from? (I'm thinking it might be bloat ware)  <answer103519> It look like the old iSync App icon - the iSync App was AFAIK removed in OS X Lion.  <comment121824> That's what it looks like to me too.  You can remove it by âŒ˜ + dragging it from the bar. <comment121828> Any idea why it may have reappeared? I'm thinking maybe when I downloaded an iOS Beta? <comment121840> It has nothing to do with iOS - iOS doesn't install anything on OS X. Which version of OS X do you have ?? <comment121854> I just noticed it is in mine also.   It is iSync related to MobileMe  http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2074?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US
