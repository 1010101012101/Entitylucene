AirDrop Not working - Missing Settings <body> I can't get AirDrop to work on my machine running OSX 10.11.4 (trying to send file to and from iPhone 6s)   I'm missing the bottom menu that reads code"Allow me to be discovered by..."/code  Any thoughts?   <answer232730> Do you meet the minimum requirements?     To send items to an iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch, you need a 2012 or newer Mac model with OS X Yosemite or later, excluding the Mac Pro (Mid 2012).
