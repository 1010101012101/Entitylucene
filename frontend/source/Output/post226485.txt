Copy extended attributes to new file (ffmpeg) <body> I'm currently trying to decode some video files with codeffmpeg/code on my computer but am not able to make codeffmpeg/code copy the tags from the source file to the destination file. I read through the man page but there seems to be no way to extract the file tags from the source file or am I missing something?  I was able to extract the information via codemdls/code but this isn't getting me anywhere. Also, I found about codexattr/code and tried to apply extended attributes this way but the option code-x/code seems to be removed and applying the attribute without that option doesn't work either.  <answer226497> I found a convenient way to apply the tags from one file to another since this was my main goal.   Install tag via brew and proceed as follows:  precodetag -a "$(tag -Nl source_file)" destination_file /code/pre  I'd still be more than interested if there was a way to apply all extended attributes from one file to another if there is any way.
