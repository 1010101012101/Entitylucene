stop iTunes from auto-playing after import <body> I drag a movie onto the iTunes icon. iTunes imports the movie, and then begins playing it for me automatically.

Drag any new files that you want to add to   iTunes onto that from now on, if you don't want them to autoplay.   Another user suggests that you can use the shortcut of kbdâŒ˜/kbd-kbdO/kbd, or just use the open dialog to open your media.  <answer61223> according to this macworld article, do the following in Terminal, quit &amp; relaunch iTunes  precodedefaults write com.apple.iTunes play-songs-while-importing -bool FALSE /code/pre  <answer121723> Another way is to drag the movie or song to their respective folders in your library, and then use the file - import method in itunes to add it to your library without having it play when it's done importing.   <comment163690> Doesn't work for drag-and-drop of mp4 video into iTunes 11.3 (54) 64-bit on Mac OS X 9.4 Mavericks.
