Disable auto tick mark <body> There is a new feature in Mavericks that causes the tick mare (`) to be added to the letter before it.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NNyBG.png" alt="enter image description here"  What is really annoying, is that it only does this where I absolutely would never want it to happen. Apps like Xcode and TextMate. However, where I would expect this behavior, TextEdit (in rich text mode) and Safari never do it. I could live without the feature completely, so I don’t care if it is off system wide, but it is driving me crazy in the programming editors.  <comment131106> Have you tried turning off autocorrect entirely? <comment131166> Can’t say I would want to go without spellcheck, but that doesn’t disable it anyway.
