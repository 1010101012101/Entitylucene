Move referenced iTunes Audio files to another drive/folder <body> well, my iTunes library is on my main HD whereas audio files are on an external drive. I have to change the drive for these files and / or folder name, how do I point iTunes library to that drive/folder?  <answer136939> Easiest way I think is to use the built in iTunes setting for choosing a library location.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bdKG6.png" alt="enter image description here"  ul liFirst make a copy of your library on your external drive/li liThen change the settings in iTunes to reflect the new location/li liProfit/li /ul  Apple also has support documents available to describe the required steps in more detail, both for Mac and Windows.  <answer136957> I got this by googling..     When I clicked on the missing title (which is indicated by a "!") iTunes asked my to locate the file; after finding it using Spotlight it was added. Then iTunes asked me if I want to locate similar files which I confirmed an there - all missing files where found.   However, I had to UNCHECK "keep iTunes Media folder organized" BEFORE doing this. After I rechecked it again.   It's ok for me at the moment!  <comment162599> It's not possible. As i've written before, my iTunes library is on internal HD though the audio files are on the external. <comment162624> I had [a similar issue](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/131099/how-can-i-run-a-partially-referenced-itunes-library). The answer for me was [TuneSpan](http://tunespan.com) <comment163033> The iTunes library files are going to always be on your internal HD, even when media is moved off.
