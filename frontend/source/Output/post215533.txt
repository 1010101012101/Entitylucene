Looking for OSX Code to send email to Messenger/SMS <body> As the iPhone can now share Messages with the Mac once it's turned on in Settings, as in one can send and receive Messages through the iPhone from the Mac, is there a way to redirect email from the Mac into the Messenger service so they go as SMS messages? I'm trying to set up an alert system from my server so I get an SMS when a critical situation develops. The software generates emails, but I'd like to get that email to go out as an SMS.  <comment260474> All major carriers have email addresses assigned to mobile numbers, so email can be sent directly to them (as SMS). Is this not the functionality you're looking for? <comment260720> Not in the UK they don't. I had to set it up with the carrier 02. Text 212 to your O2 carrier and they will send you a special email address back.
