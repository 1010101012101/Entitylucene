Why I can't remove iTunes and how to remove it? <body> Whenever I run codesudo rm -rf /Applications/iTunes.app/code, it is deleted, but after some time it's automatically restored. How can I get rid of iTunes forever without any chance of it coming back?  <answer196552> Uninstalling iTunes is not supported by Apple. Dragging it into the trash and trying to delete the trash will give you a "iTunes can't be modified or deleted because it's required by OS X" message.  Even if you do it manually, it will come back with operating system updates; and you may break certain things like some file associations and iPhone connecting/syncing abilities.  Your best bet is probably just to let it sit there and ignore it.  <answer196564> precoderm -f -r /Applications/iTunes.app /code/pre  removed it for me along with Chess, Game Centre, Photo Booth &amp; Stickies.  You have unload the ituneshelper app first (use activity monitor), I didn't need to as I delete the unnecessary OS X garbage immediately after launch.   It is untrue that it is required by OS X, it is only by required by Apple to sell you stuff.  here's an AppleScript application to automate it, or you can just paste the following into AppleScript Editor and adapt to your taste:  precode(*  Start Apple Peeler Lite and ignore any found entries  *) display dialog "This will remove unwanted Desktop Pictures, Screensavers, Dictionaries, Languages, Voices &amp; the following apps:   Chess Games Centre iTunes Photo Booth Stickies   Click OK to start, you will be prompted for your password"  (*  Applications  *) do shell script "rm -f -r /Applications/Chess.app" with administrator privileges do shell script "rm -f -r /Applications/'Game Center.app'" with administrator privileges do shell script "rm -f -r /Applications/iTunes.app" with administrator privileges do shell script "rm -f -r /Applications/'Photo Booth'.app" with administrator privileges do shell script "rm -f -r /Applications/Stickies.app" with administrator privileges  (*  Voices  *) do shell script "rm -f -r /System/Library/Speech/Voices/Alex.SpeechVoice" with administrator privileges  (*  Dictionaries  *) do shell script "rm -f -r /Library/Dictionaries/'The Standard Dictionary of Contemporary Chinese.dictionary'" with administrator privileges do shell script "rm -f -r /Library/Dictionaries/'Diccionario General de la Lengua Española Vox.dictionary'" with administrator privileges do shell script "rm -f -r /Library/Dictionaries/Dutch.dictionary" with administrator privileges do shell script "rm -f -r /Library/Dictionaries/Italian.dictionary" with administrator privileges do shell script "rm -f -r /Library/Dictionaries/'Korean - English.dictionary'" with administrator privileges do shell script "rm -f -r /Library/Dictionaries/Korean.dictionary" with administrator privileges do shell script "rm -f -r /Library/Dictionaries/'Multidictionnaire de la langue française.dictionary'" with administrator privileges do shell script "rm -f -r /Library/Dictionaries/Portuguese.dictionary" with administrator privileges do shell script "rm -f -r /Library/Dictionaries/Russian.dictionary" with administrator privileges do shell script "rm -f -r /Library/Dictionaries/'Sanseido Super Daijirin.dictionary'" with administrator privileges do shell script "rm -f -r /Library/Dictionaries/'Sanseido The WISDOM English-Japanese Japanese-English Dictionary.dictionary'" with administrator privileges do shell script "rm -f -r /Library/Dictionaries/'Simplified Chinese - English.dictionary'" with administrator privileges do shell script "rm -f -r /Library/Dictionaries/'Spanish - English.dictionary'" with administrator privileges do shell script "rm -f -r /Library/Dictionaries/Thai.dictionary" with administrator privileges do shell script "rm -f -r /Library/Dictionaries/Turkish.dictionary" with administrator privileges  (*  Screen Savers  *) do shell script "rm -f -r /Library/'Screen Savers'" with administrator privileges  (*  Desktop Pictures  *) do shell script "rm -f -r /Library/'Desktop Pictures'/Abstract.jpg" with administrator privileges do shell script "rm -f -r /Library/'Desktop Pictures'/Isles.jpg" with administrator privileges do shell script "rm -f -r /Library/'Desktop Pictures'/'Antelope Canyon.jpg'" with administrator privileges do shell script "rm -f -r /Library/'Desktop Pictures'/Lake.jpg" with administrator privileges do shell script "rm -f -r /Library/'Desktop Pictures'/'Bahamas Aerial.jpg'" with administrator privileges do shell script "rm -f -r /Library/'Desktop Pictures'/Lion.jpg" with administrator privileges do shell script "rm -f -r /Library/'Desktop Pictures'/Beach.jpg" with administrator privileges do shell script "rm -f -r /Library/'Desktop Pictures'/'Milky Way.jpg'" with administrator privileges do shell script "rm -f -r /Library/'Desktop Pictures'/'Blue Pond.jpg'" with administrator privileges do shell script "rm -f -r /Library/'Desktop Pictures'/Moon.jpg" with administrator privileges do shell script "rm -f -r /Library/'Desktop Pictures'/'Bristle Grass.jpg'" with administrator privileges do shell script "rm -f -r /Library/'Desktop Pictures'/'Mountain Range.jpg'" with administrator privileges do shell script "rm -f -r /Library/'Desktop Pictures'/Brushes.jpg" with administrator privileges do shell script "rm -f -r /Library/'Desktop Pictures'/'Mt.

Needs to be repeated after every OS X/iTunes update, but this also applies for any solutions involving removal of standard applications.  PS: Just to put things into perspective as far as disk space is concerned:  precoderoot@Mithos:/Applications$ du -sm iTunes.app Chess.app Game\ Center.app Stickies.app Photo\ Booth.app Photos.app  191 iTunes.app 5   Chess.app 3   Game Center.app 5   Stickies.app 5   Photo Booth.app 31  Photos.app /code/pre  Even on a system with just a 128 GB SSD, squeezing out 200 MB doesn't give you much.  <comment234771> I don't think you can. Every OS X update downloads a new version of iTunes, and that restores it. Why do you want to delete it? <comment234772> I want to delete it because I don't use it and I absolutely hate when I occasionally launch it by double-clicking an audio file (which I never associated with iTunes — it's iTunes' initiative) <comment234773> You can select an audio file, get info and there will be a dropdown to automatically open with selected file. And I guess you could prevent it from running by setting the chmod to rw-rw-rw- or 666 <comment234774> Yes, but that must be done for every type of file that iTunes supports, and I suspect they are prone to being reset, too… And keeping an application which is not used is a waste of space, in case of SSD this space is also expensive <comment234776> Try [this](http://superuser.com/questions/273756/how-to-change-default-app-for-all-files-of-particular-file-type-through-terminal) . It sets default open with to all apps and is located in your user preferences, so it ain't prone to resetting on update <comment234784> I don't mind losing iPhone compatibility (and I'd never buy an iOS-powered device) <comment234791> @SargeBorsch I guess you could add a cron-job that runs the delete command every day or something like that. However I'd recommend not to mess with OS-installed apps like that as there tends to be deep integration with other parts of the OS (unfortunately that's sometimes a mess on OS X) and it could interfere with OS updates (imagine a cronjob kicking in while an OS update is installing). <comment234792> @SargeBorsch (for a fun time, google for "Remove Stocks app"…) <comment234818> That rm won't have removed Chess.app or the other <comment234830> The script works though so maybe it's not a purely terminal command. Please note as Heston Whomanthal said, it is worth opening it up first to make sure it doesn't include things you want to keep). I actually added Photos.app. Script works, can't comment on individual terminal command. <comment234831> The usual caveats with downloading code (in this case an application which removes *a lot* more than what the asker is looking for) from unknown sources apply, proceed with care. <comment234833> The link is highly suspicious. <comment271459> It works! (at least, prevents launch) But apparently it also breaks updates, I mean, after installing an itunes update, App Store keeps saying that this update is to be installed. Not that I need to install them (I'm not using iTunes anyway), but it would be great to shut up App Store. Still, it's better than nothing. <comment276218> Cannot do this on `/Applications/Photos.app` with the latest system updates: `chmod: Unable to change file mode on /Applications/Photos.app: Operation not permitted`. Probably they saw this answer and broken this way. <comment276219> that's probably because `Photos.app` has the `restricted` flag. Is there any way to work around that? <comment276241> Disable SIP.  Or search the site for how to prevent Photos from auto-starting.
