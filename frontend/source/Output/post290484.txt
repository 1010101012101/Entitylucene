Attempt to copy a file denied by permissions, but why? <body> I have a folder which I wish to copy from my Macbook Air (OSX 10.10.5) onto a USB attached hard disk.  When I try to copy the folder, some files are copied, then the copy aborts with the message: emThe operation can’t be completed because you don’t have permission to access “PT3 Summary and Comments SM358 TMA01.htm”./em  If I just copy that file alone, I am asked to enter my password, and then the file is copied successfully.  The permissions for em(me)/em are read/write for the file, and for the source and target folders.  Any idea why I can't copy the whole folder?  <answer290488> This problem may occur because of wrong ownership. Try to run following command to change ownership for your user:  precodesudo chown -R $(id -un):$(id -gn) path_to_your_directory /code/pre  In this example, codesudo/code will give you needed permissions to perform operation, codechown/code is a command to change ownership, code-R/code will make operation recursive against target folder, code$(id -un)/code is your current user name code$(id -gn)/code is your current group name, codepath_to_your_directory/code shold be a path to folder you want to fix ownership.  <comment366709> Unless an ACL interferes.  I have seen Time Machine in a file restore improperly copy the ACLs from the backup.  I've even seen it put ACLs on the parent directory of the destination. <comment366875> toma, thanks.  And an apology: I'm not very familiar with Stack, and in attempting to post this I got confused by the presence of WGroleau's comment and pressed the 'vote' arrows thinking I was moving up or down the thread, so I voted your answer up twice and down once.  :-(   Before I apply your recommended procedure, can I find out who the owner currently is?  That might help me to understand how the problem arose. <comment366877> @NigelMartin you can type `ls -l path_to_problem_file` to see who is owner. <comment367872> The owner appears to be me, so I think that WGroleau's comment about ACL may be the problem.  I think the need to copy the file is not great enough to chase this further.  Thanks.
