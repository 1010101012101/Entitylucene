Does iOS (iPad) close your tabs when off when private browsing is enabled? <body> I'm just curious to know if any iOS device (particularly, in this case, the iPad 2) closes the open tabs when I run out of battery ?  <answer85396> No. Next time when you open safari again, it will reload those sites again. Basically it just remembers all the tabs which you have opened and loads it the next time.  <comment95176> Are you asking if the open tabs will reappear the next time you power your device back on? <comment95228> Why not just trying it out yourself and report back with an answer? My guess would be that they remain as they were before the shutdown.
