You can upgrade to the latest version of Adobe   Reader from www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html        For further support, go to www.adobe.com/support/products/acrreader.html   or sometimes the message is same same but different:     Please wait... If this message is not eventually replaced by the proper contents of the document, your PDF viewer may not be able to   display this type of document.

Here you can find a real life example PDF (Thanks to @Tetsujin), Canadian immigration application  I dislike Abobe's bloatware so much that I will not install their Acrobat Reader on my Mac. Ever.  When I use a Windows machine and open this PDF with Acrobat Reader there it contains a form with dropdowns and input fields.  Is there a way to open this pdf in OS X? I would prefer the Preview.app.  Screenshots:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jeRha.png" alt="you need pdf viewer"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mQo2v.png" alt="please wait pdf"  <answer150790> Certain PDF files (dynamic XFA forms) created in Adobe LiveCycle can only be opened in Adobe Reader and Adobe Acrobat. When you try to open these files in an alternative PDF viewer, then you will see this error message.  Unfortunately, it's not easy remove this message and modify the PDF so that it can be opened in alternative PDF viewers. The person who created the original form must re-create the form using options that do not restrict which PDF viewers can open and display the file.  Adobe has made the decision that since very few non-Adobe products support these special PDF files, that it is better to show this message -- and require the user to download Adobe Reader or Adobe Acrobat -- than it is to let the PDF viewer try to render the document.

It's Adobe Reader or nothing/em  <answer236084> There is a way to do it in Terminal.  In Adobe Acrobat, save file as a emPostscript/em file.  I generally save it to my desktop.  Then, open Terminal and browse to desktop by typing codecd ~/Desktop/code.  Then, enter the command  precodepstopdf filename.ps /code/pre  On the desktop,  there should be a new PDF file.  It can now be opened by Preview.  <comment177434> Preview Version 7.0 (826.4), the latest in Mavericks. <comment177435> Confirmed - I found an example so others might be able to test http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/pdf/kits/forms/IMM0008ENU_2D.pdf [nothing secret, nothing dangerous, it's a Canadian immigration application]. Preview fails, Adobe Reader works. <comment200455> In my experience it is not realistic to think Preview can always substitute for Adobe Reader, there lots of occasions when only the latter works.
