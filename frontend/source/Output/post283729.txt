Save image from screen capture without color profile <body> Is it possible to save a screenshot without the displays color profile in it? I’m using a Dell monitor with a custom color profile (created with x-rite) and since then my screenshot are much larger because macOS (I’m using 10.12.4) includes the color profile of the screen in the PNG file. E.g. a small area of the screen results in an 1.3 MB image, while the same area taken with MonoSnap leads to an image about 50 KB. However I’d prefer not to use MonoSnap because it doesn’t save the image directly but alway asks for a filename first (or opens the editor window) …  So my question is: strongIs there a setting (e.g. in codecom.apple.screencapture/code) to disable including the monitors color profile?/strong I know that the Colors then may change a bit but for my purpose I don’t need the exakt colors.  In other words: I’m looking for a simple solution to take a screenshot (full screen, area or window) that is immediately saved to my desktop and has a small (reasonable) file size. If this isn’t possible with onboard settings/software I’d even use an additional app.
