Using Drobo Gen 2 for Time Machine Backup without Sparsebundle <body> I setup a Drobo Gen 2 with 4 2TB drives on Mac OS X. The available space according to Drobo Dashboard was 5.44TB. I created a 5.40TB partition using Disk Utility, leaving 0.04TB free. I've been backing up my data to this drive for years without any apparent problem using Time Machine.  I have since learned that Drobo does not recommend or support creating partitions with OS tools as it may cause data loss. Instead, they suggest creating a sparsebundle on the drive and backup to that.   I have years of backup history on my Drobo. I would effectively have to blow-up my backup, create the sparsebundle, and start backups over again based on Drobo's support documents.  I presume the reason Drobo said one might loose data if OS tools are used to partition a Drobo volume is because one might create a partition greater than the available space of the volume. I have created one smaller 5.40TB partition where there is physically 5.44TB of available space on the Drobo volume. My Time Machine backups have been working (and verifying) for several years via this configuration. Should I be OK?
