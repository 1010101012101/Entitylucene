Can't empty trash on Mac <body> Recently every time I try to delete files, my OS asks me to type in a password.  After I type in password, the files are deleted from the folder, but it doesn't free up space and the files don't show up in the trash, so I can't empty the trash.  I've tried troubleshooting different ways from searching on Google and Apple forums:  ul liI don't have Time Machine enabled./li liI have OS X 10.7.5./li liI've deleted over 100 GB of files, but I still only have 7 GB./li liI've tried typing in Terminal:  precodesudo tmutil disablelocal /code/pre/li liI've tried typing in Terminal:  precoderesetpassword /code/pre/li liI've tried typing in Terminal:  precodesudo rm -r /.cleverfiles /code/pre/li /ul  Any other suggestions will be much appreciated.    <answer238425> I have faced similar problem on one of the Macs in my office.  I couldn't solve it directly, so I chose to delete the account, by backing up of all the important folders/files into another partition. Alternatively, you may move it out of the home folder to another folder (e.g. /Users/Shared/) temporarily. I deleted the user account and created a new one, which will solve problems with permissions, clear hidden data in the account and/or configuration problems like you are currently experiencing.  <comment292416> We don't have enough information to help you. Try using something like DiskInventoryX to find out what is using the space and let's go from there. <comment292425> Have you tried [repairing disk permissions](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201560)? <comment292439> Is yours an Administrator, Standard, or Managed user account? <comment292507> Have you tried [Trash It](http://nonamescriptware.com/downloads/)? <comment293106> Thanks everyone for all your advice, but I found out how to fix. It took me a few tries, but I followed these instructions from the below link.
