How to enable horizontal split in full screen mode in El Capitan <body> I use my external display in tower mode. I've been using third party software ( like Moom ) to split my screen horizontally when needed. Now that El Capitan supports split screen in full screen mode, is there a way to split screen natively with two apps in horizontal split, in full screen mode.  I searched everywhere and I am able to place two apps side by side but not top and bottom. I have also tried reducing window sizes of apps so that they fit well when in horizontal split mode. But still I never get the option of putting one on top of another.   Is there any other settings I need to enable?

My hope is that as more people get used to the mechanics of this, The software can be complicated to allow us to choose a horizontal petition if we desire to work that way instead of only splitting things vertically. Especially if there are compelling apps that work together in a wide but vertically narrow window.

You can send feedback to Apple [here](http://apple.com/feedback). Could you please add the apps that helped you split your screen horizontally, so other users can see what helped you? <comment257895> oh, I'll send the feedback then. Added the software that I use presently for putting 1st app on top half and 2nd app on bottom half. <comment257910> I initially would have picked horizontal over vertical if I had the design choice here. One command line prompt and whatever else I'm doing works better for much of the work I do, but I have learned how to maximize my work and there are lots of places where I'm glad for/prefer the vertical choice so far. <comment308930> This is an excellent question. I am looking for the same feature and unfortunately it seems as we are out of luck. There are several other tools that allow an individual configuration of the grid. <comment364073> It's best to add some supporting detail to this answer.
