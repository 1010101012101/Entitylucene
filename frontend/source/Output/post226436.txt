New MacBook with possible old text messages showing up in messenger <body> I feel silly asking this but I need to know the answer for my own piece of mind. So here it goes...  I just bought my girlfriend a brand new MacBook Air and set it up for her. Her iCloud and everything is set up on it. So tonight a text message pops up in messenger from some dude and the conversation is intimate in nature and I temporarily lose my self-control because it's time stamped today and the current time. She swears up and down the conversation took place months ago and had no idea why it suddenly popped up on there.  So, is there any way whatsoever that this could happen or am I being fed a bunch of incorrect information here?
