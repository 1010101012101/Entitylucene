Is there any way to list all .pkg packages that I have installed? <body> Just wondering if there is any Terminal command to do this, because I think my OSX was already messed up with some incompatible .pkg installations. Thanks.  <answer105624> The package management system used by OS X is rudimentary when compared to Linux counterparts like RPM or DEB. Fortunately, basic operations like listing packages and its contents are possible:  Everytime a code.pkg/code file is installed a BOM file is stored in code/private/var/db/receipts//code. You can either do codels/code in that directory or use codepkgutil/code to list installed packages:  precode$ pkgutil --packages (...) com.apple.pkg.HP_Scan com.apple.pkg.HP_Scan3 com.apple.pkg.HP_SmartX com.apple.pkg.InstallMacOSX com.apple.pkg.JavaEssentials com.apple.pkg.JavaForMacOSX107 com.apple.pkg.JavaMDNS com.apple.pkg.JavaSecurity com.apple.pkg.JavaTools com.apple.pkg.MBP91 com.apple.pkg.MediaFiles com.apple.pkg.MobileDevice com.apple.pkg.MobileDeviceDevelopment com.apple.pkg.OxfordDictionaries (...) /code/pre  To query the code.pkg/code file's contents use codepkgutil/code:  precode$ pkgutil --files com.apple.pkg.Pages4 | less Applications Applications/Pages.app Applications/Pages.app/Contents Applications/Pages.app/Contents/CodeResources Applications/Pages.app/Contents/Frameworks Applications/Pages.app/Contents/Frameworks/Inventor.framework Applications/Pages.app/Contents/Frameworks/Inventor.framework/Inventor /code/pre  or codelsbom/code:  precode$ lsbom /private/var/db/receipts/com.apple.pkg.Pages4.bom | less .   40775   0/0 ./Applications  40775   0/80 ./Applications/Pages.app    40755   0/0 ./Applications/Pages.app/Contents   40755   0/0 ./Applications/Pages.app/Contents/CodeResources 120755  0/0 28  2941952436  _CodeSignature/CodeResources ./Applications/Pages.app/Contents/Frameworks    40755   0/0 ./Applications/Pages.app/Contents/Frameworks/Inventor.framework 40755   0/0 (...) /code/pre  See man pkgutil and man lsbom for other options.
