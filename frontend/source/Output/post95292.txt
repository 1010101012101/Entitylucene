Which version of Windows runs best on an early 2011 MacBook Pro (and how do I obtain it)? <body> I'd like to install Windows on my early 2011 MBP via Bootcamp so I can run a highly critical piece of software (Guild Wars 2).  The system reqs. are XP or better.  h2Which version of Windows?/h2  On searching Amazon, I found that there are several versions of Windows for sale.  There's strongWindows 7 Home Premium./strong That sounds about right I guess. But does the "Premium" tag mean there's also a cheaper "non-premium" version available? If so, should I get that instead?  I understand that the current version is strongWindows 8./strong But my sense is that with Windows, one doesn't always want to run the current version.  ul liWhich release version (XP, Vista, 7, or 8) and feature version (Home, Premium, whatever) is least likely to make me miserable?/li liShould I install the 32 or 64-bit version? (64-bit, I guess, right?)/li /ul  <answer95293> Looking at the Bootcamp 5 FAQ - you want a 64 bit version of Windows 7 or 8.  ul lihttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT5639/li /ul  Furthermore, you'll want to get your specific model of MacBook Pro and check this table for the exact version you want before shopping:  ul lihttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT5634/li /ul  As for major version, I know many businesses that stuck with Windows 7 so unless you need Windows 8 - I'd vote with my wallet on the cheapest non-XP version you can get. From your question, the home version is perfect for gaming and you won't really need advanced pro/premium features based on the requirements (actually lack thereof) that you listed. A benefit of going to Windows 8 now is that presumably you'll have longer to run with it before needing to upgrade to a future OS. Mark also makes a good point that Windows 8 is marketed primarily to consumers as an upgrade version, so be sure you understand your return options when buying and check into a Windows 8 system builder / OEM version if you decide to go with 8.  <comment111757> Any reason why not using the GW2 Mac version ? <comment111762> Yes, there is . <comment111780> Note for Windows 8 for license reasons you will need the System Builder version which is more difficult to get <comment112013> Yes, you will need a 64-bit version. So you can go for Windows 7 (64 bit) Home edition. If youâ€™d rather not reboot every time you want to use a windows program, go for Parallels or VirtualBox. <comment112015> @Mark I've edited in your comment to the answer - it's really too important for someone to notice in the comments. Big thanks. <comment133829> +1 for "highly critical piece of software" :D
