How does Safari intelligent tracking prevention in Safari 11 work? <body> I read this blog and many other pages, which would pretty much redirect me to that same page.  I would like to understand the in depth behavior of the "intelligent tracking prevention" in Safari 11. E.g. what kind of classifiers are used? What are the features used to derive the target value? What are (could be) the target values? Can we reset the learnt model? Basically everything that can be known.  <comment362033> This is a Q&A site and it doesn't really function as a "tell me everything I need to know about" site. I suggest you [edit] your question to focus on a single problem you're having. See [help/on-topic] for more info. <comment362037> Could you please recommend where Can I post this question? <comment362050> Pay the fee and become an Apple developer, you can ask questions like this on their discussion boards. <comment362182> I am a developer and their documentation do not provide any other resource except the link I have shared.
