How do I move the active window menu to the top of the actual window <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HW0Tl.png" alt="enter image description here"  How do a I move the following so that it sticks to the window it belongs to. It's annoying having it only on one screen, especially when I have three screens and to access the menu I have to transverse my mouse over two screens just to get to the menu. I'd like it to act the same as in Windows sticking to the actual window. Is this possible?  <comment361747> What version of macOS do you have? Any recent version will show a menu bar on each screen; you shouldn't need to move across multiple screens for access to the menu bar. <comment361774> You can't "stick" a menu to a particular window. On the Mac the menu is **always** at the top of the screen. You can set the preference to have the menu bar on **all** screens but menus don't attach to a window. <comment361782> @grgarside - the menu is only on every screen if you uncheck 'Displays have separate Spaces' in Mission Control. If they share the same Space, the menu is on the primary only.... which actually might be half an answer @Karl? Dock will appear on all screens too with 'not separate spaces' <comment361784> btw, karl, this is a paradigm shift, Mac vs Win - & though it's obviously personal preference, there's good muscle-memory in a menu always being in the same place, for any app, at any time.... This might be useful too - https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/193937/shortcut-for-toggling-between-different-windows-of-same-app/ <comment361822> @Tetsujin I want seperate screens to have seperate spaces though. Because when I press ctrl + left I want all screens to change and not just that screen :/ <comment361823> @grgarside Sierra!
