How make changing to the /etc/hosts file take effect? <body> I added some lines to my code/etc/hosts/code file to resolve a private hostname, but every time after rebooting, the lines I added get lost. Should there be any setting options to make these changes take effect?  <answer62580> Looks like some app deletes this lines from code/etc/hosts/code on system startup. OS X itself doesn't delete any lines on startup nor reboot.  <answer62582> After changing the hosts file, change the permissions on it to stop the file being modified. You may have to play a bit to see what works.  <answer62602> The Cisco AnyConnect VPN Client is known to show this behavior. It will reset your code/etc/hosts/code file on reboot to the contents of code/etc/hosts.ac/code.  If you use this VPN client, you should make your modifications to both files.  See this hint for more info.  http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20111011050950471  <answer62608> Try codesudo nano /private/etc/hosts/code in Terminal.  <answer258310> If you are using pulse secure the file code/private/etc/jnpr-pulse-hosts.bak/code gets copied to code/private/etc/hosts/code every time you reconnect to the VPN (including each time your Mac wakes up from sleep mode).  So if you want some changes to survive a reconnection, edit the code/private/etc/jnpr-pulse-hosts.bak/code file, use  precodesudo vi /private/etc/jnpr-pulse-hosts.bak /code/pre  to add your changes there.  Then disconnect the network and reconnect (use the option disconnect in codepulse secure/code or pull the network cable off and on or disable and re-enable the wifi) and once pulse secure reconnected to your VPN, check that your changes are now in code/private/etc/hosts/code.  <comment72265> Do you edit it from root? <comment72280> @Daniil yes, of course <comment72283> And my estimated guess would be a third party VPN client. <comment72284> Are you using some third-party VPN client. Some "disfunctional" clients modify the /etc/hosts files themselves. <comment72817> god, i really use Cisco AnyConnect VPN...
