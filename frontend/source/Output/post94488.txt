how can I reload an app which is corrupted? <body> I tried to download a replacement for a corrupted Dropbox app, but the Apple store says I already own Dropbox and won't download another copy. How can I replace the Dropbox app which is defective?  <comment110786> Can you explain what you mean by "Dropbox is broken?" Can you download a new version of the dropbox app via iTunes / iPad App Store? <comment110787> This needs some minor edits to make it more clear what the problem area is. Just make an edit using the controls above and flag it for re-opening if it doesn't get reopened by the users that watch the review queue. <comment110810> Broken means that when I try to open dropbox it displays gibberish. The question is how to get the app store to load a fresh copy. <comment110812> You have to first remove the existing version and then reinstall using the App Store. This applies across the board, for OS X and iOS. <comment110820> What device are you using? Please include this in the body of your question. <comment110895> @cksum provided the answer: delete and reinstall. Thank you.
