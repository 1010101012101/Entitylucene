Photos cant be viewed although thumbnails are visible <body> I had an iphone 5 with photos on it and was backed up on icloud. My iphone 5 got stolen and i got an iphone 5s. I restored everything on to my new one, but some photos are there in thumbnail form but i cant view the full pictures. It just shows a blank page and says it is loading... 20+ photos are like this.   <comment162038> Did the restore take a long time and have you left the device connected to a good speed internet connection for 30 minutes post restore to allow time for things to complete loading? <comment162152> It failed, so I tried again and i ran out of icloud space.
