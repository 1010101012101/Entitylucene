How to pesistently configure a Macmini4,1 to boot after power failure? <body> I do have a Macmini4,1 (2010) and I want to use it as a server so it will always start even after a power failure.  Please remind that I am running Ubuntu on it, not OS X.   Still, based on what I found online I tried these options, none being good:  ul liboot OS X recovery or installer, and run codepmset autorestart 1/code/li liboot OS X and configure autorestart in Configuration panel/li licodesetpci -s 0:1f.0 0xa4.b=0/code on ubuntu./li /ul  None of these worked so far...  precode&gt;lspci|grep LPC 00:03:0 ISA bridge: NVIDIA Corporation MCP89 LPC Bridge (rev a2) /code/pre  <answer111685> The correct solution is to execute:  precodesetpci -s 00:03.0 0x7b.b=0x19 /code/pre  Be carefull that this line is for this model, for other models read the full article from http://www.mythic-beasts.com/support/macminicolo_howto.html  Also, put this in rc.local, for some strange reason it block the computer if I put it in codegrub.cfg/code  <comment130905> You can find your version using `sudo dmidecode -s system-product-name` from Linux. <comment130906> Based on http://smackerelofopinion.blogspot.com/2011/09/mac-mini-rebooting-tweaks-setpci-s-01f0.html it seems that I need to run the setpci on `03` instead of `1f` for these models, but I tried this and also failed. <comment130909> If you reset NVRAM and then boot the mini into OS X and `sudo pmset autorestart 1; sleep 20` and then pull the power once the SMC has settled after the short sleep, what happens when you plug power back in? <comment130910> @mike something strange, it worked but only once, and without sudo because on recovery disk you are in a single user mode already, without sudo. I tried to power it off after while it was in grub menu, and after powering it on it doesn't restore. This makes me believe that something is reseting its state. <comment130911> Some people recomended to reset the SMC but the proceduse seems qeid for macMini http://support.apple.com/kb/ht3964 --- it seems just like a long power-cut, nothing special. Even so tried it too. <comment130918> Even if I managed to find a better source of information with more specific registers for macmini 2010, it still does not work in my case. See http://www.mythic-beasts.com/support/macminicolo_howto.html <comment130924> I guess I was concerned that the hardware wasn't working properly. I've never had issues with Mac Mini restarting after power loss when booting into OS X proper and don't expect it to work when booted to recovery. I keep a full install of OS X in SD card and boot to that when I need to test hardware to ensure SMC and reboot work regardless of the OS in the main HDD/SSD. <comment130928> Thanks Mike, I found one command that works, but now I am going to test your approach which I like much more as it is persistent. I will be back with details, and hopefully a guide for other poor souls :) <comment150057> Link - `404`... wonk, wonk. <comment173075> Updated link: https://www.mythic-beasts.com/support/servers/colo/macminicolo_howto
