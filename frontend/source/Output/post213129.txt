Magic Mouse 2 and Magic Trackpad 2 are recognized as Mighty Mouse <body> Just got a new Magic Keyboard, Magic Mouse 2 and Magic Trackpad in the mail.  I am running OS X El Capitan; plugged them in and everything was fine. However they are not recognized as "Magic" devices.   strongCan't scroll, no gestures are working/strong.   I can't even scroll, only move cursor, click and right click. The devices are just detected as regular peripherals.  I also have the Magic Mouse 1 and Magic Trackpad 1 lying around: they work just fine. The keyboard is ok too.  Here are screenshots for the Mouse Settings on my Mac:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nE4lB.png" alt="Mouse gestures setting in System Preference" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Gv8k7.png" alt="Generic mouse settings being shown"  Any ideas?   In fact strongboth/strong the mouse and trackpad are recognized as the old Apple Mighty Mouse. This is what I see when connecting any of the devices:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dqXqb.png" alt="Notification showing Apple Mighty Mouse connected"  strongThings I've tried/strong  ul liDeleting code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.mouse / trackpad/code/li liResetting PRAM/li liResetting SMC/li liLogging as a Guest user/li liCreating new location in Networking/li liRe-pairing both with and without cable/li /ul  It always comes back as Mighty Mouse. First generation devices do work without a hitch. When both mice/trackpads are connected, preference pane shows gestures for Magic Mouse or Trackpad but only 1st gen devices work.  <answer213422> After fiddling with it for a while I came to the conclusion that I need a software update.  Installing strongOS X El Capitan 10.11.2 Beta (15C27e)/strong fixed the issue.  Got to say force touch is pretty sweet.
