How Do I Use 'cp' to Overwrite Files? <body> Using a shell script or Terminal, how do I overwrite files that may or may not be present. I looked at man page for cp, it said use the -f argument to force overwrite. But, it does nothing.  precode$ cp -f /path/to/source/file.txt /path/to/target /code/pre  Or is there another option to overwrite files using the common in-built command line tools in OS X?   <answer112962> It might be caused by a command alias.  To call codecp/code directly you can use code/bin/cp src dest/code   <answer113656> I'm stumped as to why cp is behaving this way if there's no alias involved. However, there is a quick-dirty-and-dangerous utility provided for this exact situation: codeyes/code. You can use it to pipe a continuous stream of affirmatives into any command that gives you confirmation prompts (you can use it to send any text, but the default is "y").   codeyes | cp foo bar/code will execute the cp command and bypass all confirmation prompts.  <answer152280> I also had an alias messing up with -f, call cp directly from /bin and all is fine, having an alias that prevents accidental overwrites/removals by default is pretty good, so best not remove it.     .# alias      alias cp='cp -i'   like already stated, the -i flag superceedes -f, which wouldn't allow below command to perform as intended.     .# /bin/cp -fauv src dst   <answer284856> precoderm foo/bar/destination &amp;&amp; cp source foo/bar/destination /code/pre  First you remove (coderm/code) the destination, then if successful (code&amp;&amp;/code) you do your copying. When removing a folder, please remember to add code-r/code to coderm/code (coderm -r/code).   <comment132513> It works for me. What is it doing instead of overwriting when you try it? <comment132514> If you don't have permission to overwrite the target file, this will fail. If you really want to overwrite a target file, you can use `sudo` at the beginning of the command. But use with caution! <comment132613> Not sure why this was downvoted. I was under the impression that explicitly specifying -f would override -i in the alias, but I checked and it does not. The poster should find out whether they have cp aliased (type `alias cp`). They can change the alias in their profile or use /bin/cp as suggested. <comment133063> I am using default `cp` as Apple provided it. <comment133065> @Gordon Davisson: What's it doing? nothing. It will only copy the files to the target directory if I `mv` them or `rm` them. <comment133068> @Daniel Lawson:  Without using `sudo` I can use `mv` or `rm` to move or remove files before using `cp`. Using `sudo cp` makes no difference. <comment133073> @octern: `roger$ alias cp  -bash: alias: cp: not found` <comment133078> Curiouser and curiouser. <comment133368> Does [`set +o noclobber`](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clobbering) solve your issue ? <comment168042> I had to use /bin/cp I don't know why.
