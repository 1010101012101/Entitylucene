Same Files in Two Folders, But Different Size Info? <body> Can anyone tell me how this is possible? The files in these two folders are exactly the same, but the file size reported for the folders is different. Any ideas?

If you have anything beginning with a period (.) then this will not be reported in the Finder but will still be  contributing to the size of the folder.  Try looking in at the folders in Terminal with codels -la/code to see the file contents. You can check the disk usage with codedu -sh/code   Open Terminal  precodecd /Users/Wesley/Desktop/untitled\ folder ls -la Working NotWorking du -sh Working NotWorking /code/pre  <comment34512> OK, added output above, seems that there is no .DS_Store in the one. Is that the difference? Why is it not being created btw? <comment34514> The .DS_Store is apparently generated when a folder is modified in some way by the Finder (even just moving the window) [Wikipedia Article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.DS_Store) <comment37647> are they on different versions of operating systems? <comment73384> The folder may contain some hidden files that could make the difference.
