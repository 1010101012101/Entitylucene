Remap broken "Tab" key to a function key on MacOs Sierra <body> I need to remap the tab key to a function key, as the Tab is broken. I've looked at Karabiner, but it doesn't work on Sierra  <answer284489> While Karabiner does not work in MacOS Sierra they offer Karabiner Elements which has a subset of Karabiner's features.  One of the features it strongdoes/strong have is the ability to map a function key to kbdtab/kbd.  <comment358771> Have you looked at [Karabiner Elements](https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner-Elements)? I haven't used it directly, but it's the new version being developed for macOS Sierra.
