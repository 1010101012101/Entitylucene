99c movie rentals <body> I was looking at the iTunes store on my iPad and I noticed that there is  a 99c rental category.  I was wondering when do these movies get rotated? i.e. when are new movies released as 99c rentals? weekly?  <answer36171> The 99c rental movies get changed strongonce every week/strong.
