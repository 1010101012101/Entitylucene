How to display a certain window on the output, using a video projector? <body> I want to connect my codeMacBbook Pro/code to a codevideo projector/code without showing my desktop, menu bars, dock and anything else on the wall. Basically, I just want a strongcertain window/strong to be displayed.    How can I do it on my mac? Is there any app which provides this feature?   <comment344317> Is it OK to have some other things on the projector while you set it up? <comment347169> yes it is fine.  @DAVincent
