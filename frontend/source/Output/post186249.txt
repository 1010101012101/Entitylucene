WakeOnLan not working from MacBook Air <body> I have installed codewakeonlan/code using MacPorts, but I can't get it to work over WiFi.  I emcan/em, however, use codessh/code from my MacBook to log in to another machine in the network over WiFi (an Ubuntu OS system) and use WakeOnLan in that machine to turn on another machine in the same network.  Explanation:  The topology of my network consists of several computers running Ubuntu connected together using Fast Ethernet LAN. There is also a wireless router connected to the same network. This is what I use to access the network over WiFi from my Mac. I can use codessh/code to connect to the computers using their IP address but I cannot use codewakeonlan/code from my Mac to turn them on (with their codeHWAddr/code). However each of these machines can turn each other on using their own codewakeonlan/code command while running Ubuntu.  What can I do to make my codewakeonlan/code work over WiFi? Is there a better option to turn on remote machines though Mac's WiFi Port.
