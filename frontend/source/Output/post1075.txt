What is a good Apple podcast to listen to on a daily basis? <body> If I have time to listen to just one podcast a day or every other day about Apple stuff, which one should I listen to?  I know there's a lot of different specialized Apple podcasts out there (i.e. Mac downloads, iOS apps, Apple news, etc.), but can anyone recommend a general podcast which has elements of all of these?  I'd also be interested in the best podcasts in certain specialized areas, but mostly I'm looking for one that I can listen to consistently and find out most of what is going on in the Apple world.  <answer1087> MacBreak Weekly seems to fit the bill except it's, er, weekly. I don't know of any daily podcasts.  <answer1098> h2Mac OS Ken/h2  I really like the podcast Mac OS Ken. From the description on iTunes...     This is daily Apple news. Monday   through Friday, Ken Ray brings   commute-sized tech news to the   podsphere. If it's Apple news,   Apple-related news, or news related to   Apple-related news, you'll hear about   it here. News you'll like... this is   Mac OS Ken.   It is free five times per week with a 'Day 6' show available to paid subscribers. The podcast is very well-done, informative and entertaining with a bit of humor.  On iTunes: Mac OS Ken  Web site: Mac OS Ken  <answer1185> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DX9cT.jpg" alt="alt text"  I'm not sure about the "daily" but TED talks are very good. They have multiple "streams" for audio, video, and high definition video.  <answer1231> These aren't released daily, but I also like the MacCast, and MacGeekGab.  I still listen to MacBreak Weekly, but I listen more for Andy Ihnatko than Leo Laporte.  Leo is a radio and TV guy who talks for a living. Andy studies technology and is an amazing writer.  EDIT: As a newbie to this forum, I can't post more than one hyperlink yet (Even though I belong to several other StackExchange sites), but the podcasts are all available through iTunes. I'll leave the link to Andy's blog.  <answer55631> Hypercritical from 5by5 is excellent, John Siracua is a great analyst  <comment897> I had to stop listening to MBW because Leo will not quit talking about iPhones and iPads.  They should just change the name to ios weekly. <comment921> I believe this to be off topic and very subjective, though others may feel differently.

I converted this question. <comment1060> In what way is that Apple related?
