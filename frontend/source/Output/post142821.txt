Turn off snap to road <body> Is it possible to turn off the snap-to-road functionality on an Iphone 5 (IOS7)?  On my commute to work I ride on a bicycle path next to a highway. The problem is that the bicycle path does not exist on Apple's maps so the IPhone moves the gps position to the closest road.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nCr0x.png" alt="enter image description here"br (I ride along the blue path)  This is not a single incident. It looks the same every time except if I turn off mobile data. However, turning off mobile data only work occationally. Seems like the road positions are cached.  (This happen in all GPS-apps so it is a system wide thing)  <answer231060> You can ask the app developer to add an option to set CLActivityType to CLActivityTypeOtherNavigation.
