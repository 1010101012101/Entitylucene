Where are files transfered using CG Moobile? <body> I transfered files from my PC (Win-7) by downloading iTunes and then going to Apps, and file transfer - I seen only two apps available there. CG Mobile and Nook. I choose CG Mobile and tranfered 6GB of pictures and videos to the iPad. But I cannot find them now, or open them now. But I know they are there because the memory changed.   How can i open those pictures and videos in the regular viewer?  <comment196260> where do you usually have your video or photos on ipad ? <comment196262> idk. its not even mine. just trying to help a friend. this is really not intuitive... <comment196286> Use MS Photo Gallery, part of MS Essentials, to get pictures from an iDevice. *Don't* plug a 'foreign' iDevice to iTunes or it will want to erase it.
