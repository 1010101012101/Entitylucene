Method for Combining Multiple Word Documents into One? <body> Are there any methods for combining multiple Word documents into one big document in Mac?  <answer10712> Insert  File. You have to do it one at a time, but it appears to work.  <answer119874> In MS Word 2011 for Mac, no, there is no method for combining MULTIPLE files into one big document at the same time. You can, however, combine the files one at a time. Here's what you do: Click INSERT / FILE, and follow the prompts to insert one file at a time.  <answer229590> Use Automator. It has a "Combine Word Documents" option as one of its premade Document Library items.  <comment322005> Automator is awesome! Thanks for the idea. Merged 60 files in 10 seconds.
