Control music playing on iPhone from Computer <body> Is there an app that allows one to control the music playing on my iPhone using the Function keys along the top of my Mac keyboard?  <answer57004> I haven't tried out this application, but I guess for $0.99 it's worth a shot?  Bowtie  <comment65786> This does look like a very nice option, but I couldn't find the iPhone app in the App store. Could you point me to the correct place? <comment66710> At the article I posted, there is an iTunes link at the bottom I think. ;) <comment67304> There is - thank you. Unfortunately, it appears to me that has been removed from the store. Certainly too bad.
