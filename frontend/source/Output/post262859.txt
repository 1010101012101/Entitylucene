iOS 10: Clear 'Up Next' Queue in Apple Music <body> I like to use strongUp Next/strong in Apple Music on my iPhone, and sometimes I want to clear its contents to add new music to it. Earlier in iOS 9 it was possible but now I don’t see any way to do this in iOS 10.   Is it possible to strongCLEAR/strong the strongemUp Next queue/em/strong?  em(I know how to delete a single track from the queue)/em  Using iPhone 7, iOS 10.2 (Public Beta)  <answer285062> One workaround to clear the queue and also to play a single song:   ul liQuit the Music app. This will clear the "Up Next" queue. /li liFind the song you want to play alone. /li liTap–hold the song to hail the contextual menu. /li liTap "Play Next". This creates a new queue for the lone song. /li liTap the queue and play the song. /li /ul  I admit it's frustrating in that it interrupts music if already playing. And it's unintuitive.   https://www.apple.com/feedback/
