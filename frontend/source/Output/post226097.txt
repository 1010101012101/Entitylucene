When did I reset the data counter on my iPhone? <body> Is it possible to see some detailed statistics about data usage on an iPhone (iOS 8)? In the System Preferences I can only see that I have consumed 8 GB data and 23 h of calling, but I can't see when these numbers was reset last time, average usage per month and similar details that would be useful now when I consider changing plan.  <answer226109> If you mean the usage on the mobile network, it is shown in Settings - Mobile network, all the way down, scroll down to see when it's been reset.
