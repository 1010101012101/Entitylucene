launchd keeps restarting my binary in /Library/PrivilegedHelperTools <body> I am looking to install a privileged helper tool using SMJobBless.br My plist only contains the codeMachServices/code key and codeRunAtLoad/code key. The codeRunAtLoad/code is set to true as I want to be launched automatically after install.  Now, the problem is that once the helper tool is installed and launched and it completes its job successfully - it gets relaunched and this keeps happening again and again.  h2Original launchd Job Ticket/h2  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;   &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt;   &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt;   &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;   &lt;string&gt;com.ak.SMJobBlessHelper&lt;/string&gt;   &lt;key&gt;MachServices&lt;/key&gt;   &lt;dict&gt;   &lt;key&gt;com.ak.SMJobBlessHelper.mach&lt;/key&gt;   &lt;true/&gt;   &lt;/dict&gt;   &lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;   &lt;array&gt;   &lt;string&gt;/Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/com.ak.SMJobBlessHelper&lt;/string&gt;   &lt;/array&gt;   &lt;key&gt;RunAtLoad&lt;/key&gt;   &lt;true/&gt;   &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  I have tried various things to stop it from launching again but in vain:    ol liTried to add codeKeepAlive/code to codefalse/code in the plist.  /li liTried to add codeKeepAlive/code as a dictionary with the key codeSuccessfulExit/code to false.  /li liTried to make my app sleep for occult times before quitting like sleeping for 5 minutes, 10 minutes etc. but it still gets launched again./li /ol  I have basically run out of ideas, I want it to launch only when I ask and not automatically and that too again and again.

Some launchd configurations require the process remain running for a minimum of 30 seconds – else launchd will consider the process as crashed and automatically relaunch it.  Does your codecom.ak.SMJobBlessHelper/code conform to the requirements set out in the launchd documentation?  <comment124479> Can you please include the plist in the question? <comment124484> @patrix I have added it. <comment147103> Thanks for replying. Yes, its copy and paste error. The dict is present in the actual plist. My binary completes after about 60 seconds. I have also tried by putting sleep for 5,10 minutes so that launchd does not think we have crashed but in vain. <comment147104> I have also tried using a simple binary which just sleeps for 30 seconds and returns 0 or 1 but I got the same result and the binary was launched again and again. <comment147105> I believe it conforms to the requirements in the launchd documentation.
