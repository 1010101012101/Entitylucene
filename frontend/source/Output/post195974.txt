Open Preview for iPhone and SD card <body> Is there a way to automatically open Preview whenever I plug my iPhone in my Mac to import the photos? Also want to do this when connecting my Nikon SD card. I just hate this new Photos app, I prefer to use Preview to import.  <answer195975> ol liConnect your phone./li liOpen strongImage Capture/strong from your Applications folder./li liIn the bottom-left corner of the Image Capture window, select "Preview" where it says "Connecting this iPhone opens:"/li liRepeat while your Nikon SD card is connected./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4m8g0.png" alt="Screenshot of Image Capture window"  <comment234006> I just love you. <comment234024> @sanjuro8998 lets stay professional here :)
