iPhone 6 iOS 8 - Group chat not working <body> I started using the iPhone 6 and my group chats haven't been working. Any new chat created with the new phone works, but all my old conversations show up as individual messages from the members of the group.  Send as SMS: ON  Send as MMS: ON  Any ideas?
