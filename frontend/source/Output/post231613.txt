My iPhone Literally Gets Full When I Connect To Computer <body> 0 bytes available even though the apps on my phone aren't close to filling the 16GB. I don't sync with iTunes, all I do is debug apps with Xcode. On iTunes it shows that "other" mostly fills it up. It's iPhone 6 Plus OS 9.2.1.  I have already hit "Erase all content and settings" 3 times, it works until I connect it to my computer and debug an app I'm working on on Xcode - (I delete the app after I use it too).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hM7Q3.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer231615> Because Autofill is on In your iTunes,  Simply Connect your phone to iTunes then Go to Summary then Uncheck Autofill.  <answer231628> It is filling the others. You probably have some apps installed with data. Try to disable/limit sync for apps like Google Drive, Dropbox or even fitness apps where you have to download training videos, etc.  <answer231894> I found the solution. Back up to computer, encrypt, then restore that backup from computer.
