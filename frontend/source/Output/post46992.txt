Backup online iMessage repository <body> Is there a way to download/export iMessage history somewhere? If I deleted messages on a local device, is it also removed online on iCloud?  <answer47046> You can use PhoneView or a similar application to download your iMessage database to your Mac.  iMessage data is not stored in iCloud, not even as a backup.  <answer239027> If you want to access your iMessage history, use Baskup, an OS X application that backs up all your iMessages from your Macbook   https://peterkaminski09.github.io/baskup
