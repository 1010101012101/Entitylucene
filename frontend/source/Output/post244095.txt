How do I clear Google Chrome's DNS cache entirely? <body> Chrome is quite aggressive about caching HTTP responses. I assume this is for speed.  However, for a web developer such as myself, this can often be problematic, since pages I work on often change a lot.  For instance, my company's public website had a connection problem that I fixed but Chrome still gives me a codeERR_CONNECTION_RESET/code page whenever I visit it (the root domain and every URL under it). If I use any other browser, or Incognito mode it works. Also visiting subdomains works.  I've tried the following:  ol liRestarting Chrome/li liClearing browser data/li liGoing to chrome://net-internals/#dns and clearing host cache/li liGoing to chrome://net-internals/#sockets and flushing socket pools/li liClosing all tabs and restarting/li liAll or some of the above and flushing the OS DNS cache with: codesudo dscacheutil -flushcache;sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder;/code/li /ol  On my colleagues' Windows computers, simply clearing host cache in Chrome works.  I'm using Chrome 52.0.2743.49 beta on El Capitan / 10.11.5 (Btw: Have had the same problem with non-beta Chrome in the past)  Any advise?   <answer288842> Just clear the "Cached images and files" in step 2 works for my Chrome on Mac Sierra most of the time, sometimes I need add step 3 and 4.
