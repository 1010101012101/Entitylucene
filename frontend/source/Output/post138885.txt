Trying to get Sublime Text 3 working from terminal <body> I am trying to get the Sublime Text to work with Git from the following tutorials http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/osx_command_line.html and https://help.github.com/articles/associating-text-editors-with-git#using-sublime-text-as-your-editor  I created a bin directory with codemkdir ~/bin/code and run the line codeln -s "/Applications/Sublime Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl" ~/bin/subl/code I have then tried the command codesubl --help/code but get the following error  precode-bash: subl: command not found /code/pre  If I go to my Finder I can see subl in the bin folder in my username. What am I doing wrong?  <answer138894> You need to add code~/bin/code to your codePATH/code variable. In Terminal, type codecd/code to return to your home directory. Then, type codebin/subl .profile/code to open your code~/.profile/code file. If it doesn't exist, Sublime will just create an empty file. Add this line to it:  precodeexport PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH /code/pre  and save the file. Close out of Sublime, and restart Terminal. You now should be able to use the codesubl/code command from any directory.
