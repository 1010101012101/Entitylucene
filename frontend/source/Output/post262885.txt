Captive portal detection doesn't pop up <body> As of fairly recently, the captive portal detection on my Mac doesn't seem to work properly.  I connect to a public Wifi network, one that requires going through a login screen or requires me to accept some terms and conditions.  Previously, this would trigger a pop-up with a mini-web browser showing that login page.  However, now I get no pop-up, and if I try to open a page in Safari, I get an error screen saying that I'm not connected to the Internet.  As a result, I'm not able to get Internet connectivity, even though I'm connected to the Wifi network.  It feels like this might have started happening after I upgraded to Mac OS X Sierra.  It now happens even on Wifi networks that previously triggered the captive portal pop-up.  When this happens, I've verified that I can connect to the Wifi network from my iPhone, and the iPhone does detect the captive portal and show me the page.  I've also verified that, when it happens, I'm connected to the Wifi network (as indicated by a full 4 bars in the Wifi icon in the status bar at the top of the screen).  Is there a way to manually pop up the login screen or get to the login screen some other way?  Or, is there a way to troubleshoot what's going wrong?
