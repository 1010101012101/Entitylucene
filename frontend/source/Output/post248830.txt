OSX version of `mount -l` <body> On Linux codemount -l/code nicely lists all my mount points:  precodemount [-l] [-t type]     lists all mounted filesystems (of type type). The option -l     adds the labels in this listing. See below /code/pre  The same command does not seem to exist on OS X... Can someone point me to the right command?  <answer248831> In Terminal type, codeman mount/code and press kbdenter/kbd.  It says:     The system maintains a list of currently mounted file systems. If no   arguments are given to strongmount/strong, this list is printed.   So, in Terminal type, codemount/code and press kbdenter/kbd.  <answer248834> Under OS X, the codemount/code command has the code-t/code option. The volume label is also shown in the output as part of the mount point. For example on my Mac, the command codemount/code produces the following output.  precode/dev/disk0s5 on / (hfs, local, journaled) devfs on /dev (devfs, local, nobrowse) map -hosts on /net (autofs, nosuid, automounted, nobrowse) map auto_home on /home (autofs, automounted, nobrowse) /dev/disk0s2 on /Volumes/Shark (ntfs, local, read-only, noowners) /dev/disk0s3 on /Volumes/Shark2 (ntfs, local, read-only, noowners) /dev/disk0s4 on /Volumes/FREEDOS2011 (msdos, asynchronous, local, noowners) /dev/disk0s7 on /Volumes/Steelhead2 (hfs, local, journaled) /dev/disk1s1 on /Volumes/USB4GB (msdos, local, nodev, nosuid, noowners) /code/pre  To get just the codentfs/code file systems, I would use the command codemount -t ntfs/code. The output is shown below.  precode/dev/disk0s2 on /Volumes/Shark (ntfs, local, read-only, noowners) /dev/disk0s3 on /Volumes/Shark2 (ntfs, local, read-only, noowners) /code/pre  In both cases, the volume labels are displayed.  precodeIdentifier  Label ----------  ----------- disk0s2     Shark disk0s3     Shark2  disk0s4     FREEDOS2011 disk0s7     Steelhead2 disk1s1     USB4GB /code/pre  What is missing is the label for codedisk0s5/code which happens to be codeSteelhead/code.  An alternative way to display labels is to use the command codediskutil list/code. For my Mac, this output is shown below.  precode/dev/disk0    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:       Microsoft Basic Data Shark                   202.0 GB   disk0s2    3:       Microsoft Basic Data Shark2                  202.0 GB   disk0s3    4:       Microsoft Basic Data FREEDOS2011             50.0 GB    disk0s4    5:                  Apple_HFS Steelhead               245.1 GB   disk0s5    6:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s6    7:                  Apple_HFS Steelhead2              198.9 GB   disk0s7    8:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s8    9:                        EFI REFIND                  134.2 MB   disk0s9 /dev/disk1    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *4.0 GB     disk1    1:                 DOS_FAT_32 USB4GB                  4.0 GB     disk1s1 /code/pre  <comment308452> How silly of me... I was so used to the `-l` option that this default usage totally escaped me. Many thanks.
