What is the domain name for the iCloud Activation Server? <body> I am just wondering if anyone had the current hosts of the iCloud Activation servers, as I am currently writing a script that utilizes them. Any help is much appreciated. I know that it used to be albert.apple.com, however I am away from home and don't have admin privileges to install a packet sniffer at work.  <answer268536> It's still albert.apple.com, I don't think it's changed.  ul lihttps://albert.apple.com/WebObjects/ALUnbrick.woa/wa/deviceActivation/li /ul
