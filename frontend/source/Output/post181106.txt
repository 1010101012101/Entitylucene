Launchctl says plist is invalid, plutil says it's OK <body> I'm trying to have launchd run a shell script when I join a new WiFi network. I've created this plist file (closely based on this SuperUser answer) at code/Users/myname/Library/LaunchAgents/my.networkChangeListener.plist/code:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" \  "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;dict&gt;   &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;   &lt;string&gt;my.networkChangeListener&lt;/string&gt;   &lt;key&gt;LowPriorityIO&lt;/key&gt;   &lt;true/&gt;   &lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;   &lt;array&gt; &lt;string&gt;/Users/myname/bin/networkChangeListener/onNetworkChange.sh&lt;/string&gt;   &lt;/array&gt;   &lt;key&gt;WatchPaths&lt;/key&gt;   &lt;array&gt;     &lt;string&gt;/etc/resolv.conf&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;string&gt;/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/NetworkInterfaces.plist&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;string&gt;/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.airport.preferences.plist&lt;/string&gt;   &lt;/array&gt;   &lt;key&gt;RunAtLoad&lt;/key&gt;   &lt;true/&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  My user is the owner of the plist, and the group is "staff".  When I try to load the file by running codelaunchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/my.networkChangeListener.plist/code, I get an error saying "Invalid property list".  However, when I run codeplutil ~/Library/LaunchAgents/my.networkChangeListener.plist/code, it returns "OK"  What is the problem with my plist file? Is is something specific to launchd? I'm completely at a dead end for how to debug this.  <answer181127> The first few lines should be  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict&gt; /code/pre  Your file (as well as the one in the linked answer) is missing the code&lt;plist version="1.0"&gt;/code part.  <answer181142> A totally blank plist looks like this:   precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict/&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  I use PlistEdit Pro when having to do a lot of changes, as it is easy to make mistakes.   <comment215333> Thank you! That solved the problem. It does seem like something `plutil` should have caught â€¦ but then, it also seems like something I should have caught in the oodles of times I read over the code looking for mismatched tags. <comment215361> Just as a hint: OS X comes with xmllint, which is part of the OpenSource libxml. If you just want to validate xml, you could try this:  `endor-3:~ garex$ xmllint /tmp/my.networkChangeListener.plist /tmp/my.networkChangeListener.plist:21: parser error : Extra content at the end of the document /plist ^`  That showed that your plist tag was closed but not opened...
