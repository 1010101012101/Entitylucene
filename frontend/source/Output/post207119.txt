In terminal (bash), should I be in a folder to move it to another? <body> In a directory named World, I've been asked to move a folder within it--South_America--to another folder also within World--North_America. 1. I can't figure out if I should be in South_America or one level up. 2. Wherever it is that I should be, I don't know what code to write. Thanks (I hope)!   <answer207122> Assuming You are in codeWorld/code directory (check with codepwd/code command) and dir tree looks like:  precodeWorld  |___ South_America  |  |___ North_America /code/pre  You simply do:  precodemv South_America North_America/ /code/pre  When You are in codeSouth_America/code already, You can:  precodemv ../South_America ../North_America/ /code/pre  <comment249736> Great! (I just have to recall how to move up [I'm brand new at coding] and I'll give it a shot.) <comment249738> Whoops. I didn't realize that return = you're done. Anyhow, many thanks and I love your cinema-themed icon. <comment249740> It worked! Thanks again! <comment249741> I think you need to look at some Unix tutorials or books as this is a basic part of the file system and if you don't know this there will be many other things that you need to know <comment249742> You're right, Mark. I'm doing a learn-as-you-go thing, which is not necessarily the best approach (and leads to no-doubt annoying questions such as mine). All the best, Hope <comment249754> It also could lead to costly errors for you <comment249755> Costly? Egads. K. Thanks again for the heads up.
