Does using "rm" command cause journaling corruption? <body> Some time ago I had some problems with my Mac drive, so I went to the recovery partition and used Disk Utility to check for problems. It reported a huge discrepancy between the journaled free blocks and the actual free blocks, in the case of gigabytes.  I was wondering what may have caused this problem, and I remembered deleting a huge hierarchy of folders using coderm -rf/code, and since this command is almost instantaneous, I thought it may have caused this problem.  Does this make any sense? Should I avoid using this command on OS X with a Journaled drive?  <answer99621>    strongNOTE FOR CASUAL READERS:/strong coderm -rf/code destroys data.  Use with caution.   coderm -rf/code may appear to go fast, but it is actually recursively going depth-first into each directory and unlinking the files withinâ€”the same operation that is used for any file deletion on Unix systems.  You can see how coderm -rf/code works by adding the code-v/code flag, e.g. coderm -rfv/code.  There's no reason to believe that coderm/code itself is responsible for journaling failures.  It's a proven and safe command that does not have any low-level access to the disk.  It emis/em possible that the access pattern created triggered some bug in HFS+, but that seems unlikely as well; I coderm -rf/code sizable trees of files on my machine frequently and haven't seen a problem.  <comment117369> Great explanation, thank you!
