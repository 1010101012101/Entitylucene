How to connect to a FTP server from a Wi-Fi Hotspot that prevents direct FTP connections? <body> I am using the wifi at a library where they prevent me to connect to FTP servers for some reason. I need to upload my work.  Is there any tool or trick to go around this?  <answer31436> I actually have found one solution:  net2ftp - a web based FTP client  Usual warnings concerning (non-)confidentiality of data etc. apply.  <answer142364> You can do it by connecting directly via Internet Explorer.  You just have to tap in the url : ftp://ftp.yourwebsite.com / Then enter your password and that's it.  But it can only be a temporary solution because I don't think it's really safe to do it that way ...  <comment167699> This still results in the browser accessing the FTP port on the server (which is blocked).
