Macbook startup disk full; GP shows 164GB of 'Miscellaneous used space' <body> I can't work on my macbook anymore as it constantly pops up 'startup disk full' I went through every article I could find, cleaning up as much as I could.   I deleted unnecessary backups, do not have any other user accounts, cleared trash, etc etc.   I currently have about 70GB of files I actually need, and now Grand Perspective is showing me I have 164GB of 'Miscellaneous used space'.  What is this space and can I get rid of it?  <answer272373> I found the this link on MacRumors that sounds like the same problem you are having. The gist of it seems to be clearing the system cache using this command codesudo rm -r /System/Library/Caches/code could help ( assuming that is where the issue lies). You should also be able to hopefully figure out what is using up all the space with this command codesudo du -chxd 1 //code to see what is taking up all the space.  <comment342331> Thanks Chillie, I can't seem to clear Cache because it won't permit me to do so, even after enterring all the passwords etc. <comment342333> You could try adding an f after the -r so it would look like "sudo rm -rf" or maybe try booting from the recovery partition. that way the cache is not in use when trying to delete.
