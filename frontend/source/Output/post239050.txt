How to convert an epub package to regular epub? <body> I have some epub files in my iCloud Drive that are essentially packages.  I can show package contents and then it shows me a hierarchy of files and folders.  How can I convert this structure to a standard epub that any regular epub reader will understand?  <answer239061> An ePub file is essentially just a zipped folder, though it has a mimetype file inside which apparently needs to not be compressed.  This would imply that it's not completely straightforward to recreate with a simple zip app. However, it may be simpler than that.br Let's assume nothing has actually unpacked it, merely got confused about how to deal with it. Work on a copy.  Two things to try...  ol liTry just renaming it, change .epub to .zip, then change it back again, see if it's recognised correctly./li liOpen it in Calibrebr You than have a myriad ways to deal with it, simplest is see if it can talk to your ebook reader via OPDS. Calibre can run its own local server on your wifi &amp; you can copy books over very simply.br If still no joy, get Calibre to convert it to an ePub [again] This is a great method for fixing a file, as it can re-examine it, fix fonts, bad hyphenations, all kinds of issues./li /ol  Calibre itself is too big a subject to really cover in a simple QA, but there are reams of data about it on the site itself &amp; at http://www.mobileread.com/forums/ including sections for most major e-readers too.  <comment293274> (this may be an answer) Have you tried directly inserting the ePub from your iCloud drive into your ePub reader? <comment293275> Yes, I've tried that @Brick, however they show up as folders as noted above... <comment293276> As in, does it properly display as intended in the reader? <comment293281> No, they show up as a folder instead of a book. They simply give a folder hierarchy. I had figured that perhaps an epub folder would just need to be compressed and then renamed appropriately perhaps... <comment293322> Very interesting, thanks.  I'm glad you confirmed my suspicion re: the compression.  Are you aware of any method to do this via the shell off the top? I'm assuming that this will be pretty quick and easy with a simple incantation if I can fiddle around and either find one or come up with one. <comment293323> I did find this - http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=29057 - though I'm no expert when it comes to Terminal. <comment293325> Excellent, thanks!
