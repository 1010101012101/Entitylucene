Configuring keyboard shortcuts <body> I'm using OS X 10.7.2 and there are a couple keyboard shortcuts that are just driving me crazy - how do I change them?  ul liIn strongChrome/strong, "Go Back" (or Forward) is kbd&#8984;/kbd + kbd[/kbd or kbd&#8984;/kbd + kbd]/kbd (for forward), how do I change it to kbd&#8984;/kbd + kbd&larr;/kbd or kbd&#8984;/kbd + kbd&rarr;/kbd (for forward)/li liIn strongChrome/strong, search is kbdalt/kbd + kbd&#8984;/kbd + kbdF/kbd .  I want it to be kbd&#8984;/kbd + kbdK/kbd (like in Windows or Linux)/li liWhen working with text, going to the beginning or end of a line is kbdcontrol/kbd + kbdA/kbd, I want it to be kbd&#8984;/kbd + kbd&larr;/kbd or kbd&#8984;/kbd + kbd&rarr;/kbd (for right)/li /ul  Thanks!  <answer42720> In general, you can edit, create and enable/disable keyboard shortcuts using the strongKeyboard Shortcuts/strong tab of the strongKeyboard/strong preferences pane. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UfM0J.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment48575> Do you intend your text shortcut to apply only to Chrome or be a system wide keyboard shortcut? <comment48576> A system wide shortcut. Although this shortcut is last, it is the most important. That is, if you can't have overlapping keyboard shortcuts, I'll find another shortcut for go-back/forward in chrome. <comment48577> You get both. App shortcuts override a system one by design. Open System Preferences and type this into the help menu search: "create keyboard shortcuts" - what step is failing you? <comment48578> yes, I got that far... Can you be more specific on how I change the 3 shortcuts I asked about. <comment48580> "You must type the command exactly as it appears in the application menu" - the last shortcut I want doesn't show in the application menu. <comment48582> And, I changed "Back" and "Forward" as you suggest. In the menu, in chrome, I see the new shortcut, but it doesn't work using the keyboard. Ideas? <comment48622> Command-left/right *does* go to the beginning/end of a lineâ€¦ <comment48689> I restarted the computer and now everything works (!!). The back, the forward, the "jump to beginning of line". Thanks for the help.
