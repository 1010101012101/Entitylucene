I brought an iPhone but now think it's stolen, what can I do? <body> I bought an iPhone off a lady which by now I thank was a stolen phone:  ul liI tried to activate the phone I got right through to wifi settings /li liNow I'm stuck on iCloud settings and asked for pervious Apple ID /li /ul  There is a number displayed to call in case the phone is found, but that number is not active.  What can I do now?  <answer179398> You can't do anything. It wouldn't be a very good deterrent against theft if you could bypass the activation lock.   Don't buy stolen goods in the future.   <answer179399> Ring the phone number, let the original owner know you 'found' it.br If the number doesn't work, hand it in to the police.  There is no way to bypass the activation lock.  Consider the £250 a lesson learned.  <comment212621> If the owner answers ask for finders fee....  $250 :) <comment212622> That did strike me as a possibility ;) <comment212698> @Patrix, rather then deleting my well meant comments all over the place, how about doing some real work and taking care of this with -6 votes ? <comment212704> @Buscar웃 This site is community-moderated.
