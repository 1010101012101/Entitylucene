Apple wireless keyboard it's always turned off at startup <body> My wireless Apple bluetooth keyboard has been acting up recently. While I use the computer it works just fine but every time I boot up the computer after it has been shut down the keyboard, which is always left on, is turned off and I need to power it up - every time the computer starts up.  On the other hand my magic mouse works wonderfully, so I understand this isn't normal behavior.  How can I get the keyboard to stay on despite computer power cycles?  <answer79281> So the keyboard really needs to long-press turn on again? That's weird.  But these are things I will try:  Re-Pair the keyboard. Delete it from the known bluetooth device list, and pair it again.  Test the keyboard with other Macs  Replace the battery
