How to reset 2006 iMac to factory settings without install CD? <body> This question addresses how to restore a 2011 iMac to factory conditions, but the process doesn't seem to work with a 2006 iMac.  Google searches suggest the install CD is required, though some people on forums also claim it's possible by using an Internet installation. Is it possible to restore such an old iMac to factory conditions without the install CD?  The goal is to wipe all personal data before selling the computer.  <comment305065> You will probably need to buy a restore disc, anyway you wouldn't want to sell a computer that lacks something that is needed like that. <comment305066> The optical disc that came with an iMac in 2006 was a DVD not CD. Also you said, "_This question addresses how to restore a 2011 iMac to factory conditions ..._" but what question are you referring to? You did not provided a link to the question, although it probably doesn't matter if it's not applicable to a 2006 iMac. You can get the [Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard DVD directly from Apple](http://www.apple.com/shop/product/MC573Z/A/mac-os-x-106-snow-leopard) for $19.99. Then you can then boot with it, use Disk Utility to erase the HDD, using appropriate security options, and then install the OS. <comment305068> @user3439894 thanks for the reminder to link to the question. so there is no way to do it without an install CD? someone had said you could do it over the internet? <comment305071> @Crashalot, You keep referring to a CD, the install disc is a DVD, not CD!  To do it properly you need to erase the disk using Disk Utility to erase the HDD, using appropriate security options so as to ensure no personal data/information is retrievable. Then reinstall the OS without creating an Account.  In other words, when it reboots to create the Account after the initial install just turn off the computer so when the person buying it starts it they'll have to create their own account. Then you'll also have the DVD to give to them and past the cost of the DVD on to them. :) <comment305072> @user3439894 sorry meant DVD :) why don't you post as an answer? <comment305073> @user3439894 and there is no way to do so without the DVD? <comment305075> @Crashalot, Technically there is however without first knowing the explicit iMac model information I don't want to waste time as not all possibilities are applicable to all 2006 iMac models.  Additionally it requires having a working Mac and the Install Mac OS X Lion.app bundle, but that's only for the iMac5,1, iMac5,2 and iMac6,1  2006 models. The iMac4,1 and iMac4,2  2006 models require the DVD. The easiest way is to get the DVD I linked from Apple. <comment305082> @user3439894 please post as an answer so you can get credit. here are the specs for the machine: http://sfbay.craigslist.org/pen/sys/5698884108.html. can you tell which model it is? <comment305086> @Crashalot, There were two iMac 2006 models with a 1.83 GHz processor and Intel Graphics Media Accelerator (GMA) 950 graphics adapter, the iMac (Mid 2006 17-inch), iMac4,2 that can run Mac OS X 10.6.8 and the iMac (17-inch Late 2006 CD) iMac5,2 which can run Mac OS X 10.7.5. So you need to find the "Model Identifier", e.g. iMac4,2. In a Terminal use: `system_profiler SPHardwareDataType | grep "Model Identifier"` or option-click the Apple menu and select "System Informationâ€¦". You should see "Model Identifier:" under "Hardware Overview:". <comment305096> @user3439894 thanks just checked, this is the late 2006 model and it's already running 10.7.5. given this, could you please explain how to reset to factory conditions? thanks. <comment305099> You'll need a copy of the Install Mac OS X Lion.app bundle, which if you previously purchased it... it should be under Purchased in the App Store. You'll also need a copy of [DiskMaker X](http://diskmakerx.com) and a blank DVD or 4 GB USB thumb drive to create the installer. Note that when re-downloading the Install Mac OS X Lion.app bundle and it starts the Install process you'll need to force quit the installer (option-click the Dock Tile and select Force Quit) so it doesn't self-delete. There are plenty of instruction for how to make a bootable Lion install disc or drive on the Internet.
