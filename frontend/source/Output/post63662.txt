How to change PATH environment variable to OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion that will be visible to GUI applications? <body> I tried all methods I heard of for setting environment variables on OS X 10.8 but none of them seems to work.  To test, run a bash script from inside a gui application like Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA.  precode#!/bin/bash set|grep PATH /code/pre  Things I tested and that are strongnot working/strong even after reboot:  ul licode/etc/paths/code and code/etc/paths.d/something/code/li licode/etc/launchd.conf/code/li licode~/.bash_profile/code/li licode~/.MacOSX/environment.plist/code (binary plist made as recommended)/li lirunning codelaunchctl setenv PATH $PATH/code from the command line, this was supposed to update the PATH for GUI apps, at least for current session. Guess what, no change./li /ul  It seems that PATH is always codePATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin/code for GUI apps.  <answer63685> It works if you call the GUI app from Terminal:  precodePATH=/this/is/kind/of/crazy:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin /Applications/Automator.app/Contents/MacOS/Automator  /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mvnMt.png" alt="enter image description here"  Not really nice or comfortable but it does the job if needed.  <answer63689> Supposedly, codelaunchctl/code provides codePATH/code to GUI Apps. To set the path to that of shell path, add the following to your shell rc file after setting your path:  precodelaunchctl setenv PATH $PATH /code/pre  <answer65880> I cooked up another solution, inspired by patrix one here, that hopefully is a little less painful. Open codeAutomator/code, select an application as target, and choose codeExecute Shell script/code (or whatever it is called, in German it is "Shell-Skript ausf√ºhren" as can be seen above) as action. In the script, just type  precodelaunchctl setenv FOO1 bar1 [...] launchctl setenv FOOn barn open -a YourApplicationHere /code/pre  Then save the whole thing wherever you want, and if you need to run emYourApplicationHere/em, open the created "automator application" instead.  I tested this with codeTerminal/code as emYourApplicationHere/em, and saw with codelaunchctl export/code that strongFOO/strong was indeed set to strongbar/strong. I hope it works for others as well.  Finally, if you use this solution for your environment variables, instead of typing the codelaunchctl/code stuff in the shell script, you may just call code/Users/Shared/conflaunchd.sh/code (which you have to make up first, together with the file describing the variables).  <answer73818> With Mountain Lion code/etc/launchd.conf/code is where you should set the GUI applications Path. Remember it's not a script file; it only supports codelaunchctl/code commands so you should write something like:  precodesetenv PATH /new/path:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin /code/pre  Note also that it doesn't support shell environment variable substitutions (like code$PATH/code) so you'll have to set every path that you want to include. It's a good idea to keep the original paths that you've mentioned (code/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin/code).  You'll have to reboot after changing (or creating) the file for the changes to take effect.  <comment73642> Are you OK with a solution that sets the bash path or do you really need to change launchd's value of the base path for all processes? <comment73643> I need to change the PATH used by GUI apps, for terminal/bash/... I already have a big set of working solutions. <comment73688> Unfortunately this doesn't work :-( <comment73693> http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/51677/how-to-set-path-for-finder-launched-applications/51678#51678 <comment73751> Shortly NO WAY. I am not willing to do this, it will work only sometimes. The app can also be started when you click on a file. <comment73753> As I said it's not really nice but may work until Apple fixes the issue (because it *should* be possible with launchctl). <comment77525> We allow answers that make a good faith effort to address the question. We even allow wrong answers and let the voting speak for correctness. Commenting without making it personal is the best way to poke a hole in a faulty argument rather than discouraging attempts to answer. <comment77527> I don't know why eclipse and others don't just support [runtime environment variables](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPRuntimeConfig/Articles/EnvironmentVars.html) so every java developer on Mac doesn't need to worry about setting the path or sourcing in their desired variables in each project. <comment87470> This worked for me in 10.8.2 for setting a PATH which was usable with Keyboard Maestro. <comment92115> answer see here: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/51677/how-to-set-path-for-finder-launched-applications/79845#79845 <comment118071> The man page says that you can use $HOME/.launchd.conf but that did not work for me.  Using /etc/launchd.conf did.  I'm on 10.8.4 <comment123214> It doesn't work for me : `-bash: setenv: command not found` <comment153395> If anyone was confused like Colas, `setenv` is a `launchctl` command, so you use it like `launchctl setenv`.
