Audio & Left side USB fail on Mackbook Air Mid 2013 <body> Just wondering if anyone has any thoughts on the likely culprit for my mac that has decided to start being a pain in the ass.  Basically, the in-built audio has failed with both sound input and output displaying the "No Output Devices Found" message in the sound preferences screen. At the same time, the left side USB port (as looking at the device, under the magsafe port) also isn't working.   I've tried:  ul liPRAM/SMC reset/li liTrying headphones/li liTrying a USB headset (works on right side port, but seems to make the mac try to recognise the in-built sound, which causes the whole system to crash) /li liDoing a complete fresh install of OSX (I know, extreme. And ineffective)/li /ul  The system is fully updated. But based on the audio and left side USB port both failing, I suspect a hardware problem.   Is it hardware? And if so, any suggestions on a fix other than taking it back to the apple store for expensive fix?  <answer285108> If trying to use the Audio Midi Setup (as suggested in comments by Tetsujin) doesn't help, your next step would be to run Apple Diagnostics.  strongRun Apple Diagnostics/strong   Follow the steps below to run Apple Diagnostics:   ol liFully shut down your Mac /li liRestart your Mac /li liImmediately press the kbdD/kbd key and strongkeep it down/strong until you see the Diagnostics screen appear /li liWait for Diagnostics to finish (this typically only takes a few minutes) /li liOnce complete, one of two things will appear on the screen:   ul lia emNo issues found/em message /li lia brief description of any errors found plus further instructions /li /ul/li liIf the diagnostics test does find errors, take a note of what they are /li /ol  strongNote:/strong If pressing and holding the kbdD/kbd key at Step 3 doesn't work, start again at Step 1 and, at Step 3 press and hold both the kbdOption/kbdkbdD/kbd keys instead. This will try and run diagnostics from the internet instead, so you will need to allow more time for it to complete. Regardless, take a note of what happens and let me know how you went.  <comment359501> Possible duplicate of [Right speakers malfunction on MacBook Pro Retina](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/191509/right-speakers-malfunction-on-macbook-pro-retina) <comment359505> tbh, I'm not sure it's a duplicate, but my answer there can quickly eliminate hardware/software <comment359586> Looks like it is a hardware problem. Diagnostics advises: `There may be an issue with the audio hardware Reference code: VFF001` <comment359587> I don't think it's the same issue, but thanks for the suggestion <comment359591> Yeah, I was doubtful myself, after I re-read your post - I left the link in there just in case. If I pull my vote, I think the link may disappear, so let me test & if so I'll re-add it below, just in case it may be of some use to future Googlers. <comment359592> Link still there... but just in case it vanishes later - for potential [if not directly-related] audio hardware fail, try this answer - https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/191509/right-speakers-malfunction-on-macbook-pro-retina
