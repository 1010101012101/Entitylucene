Why do some files in Mac OS X say 'Date Modified' as '24 January 1984 08:00'? <body> When I am copying files on a Macintosh, I notice that the folder says that its Modified/Created timestamp is 24 January 1984 08:00. Why is this particular timestamp is used? Is it something to do with when Mac OS X was first released?  <answer198844> January 24, 1984 is the date that the first Macintosh went on sale.  Apple do love their easter eggs...  <answer198846> It is the Mac's birthday.  Jan. 24, 1984, was the date Jobs took to the stage to show off the very first Macintosh in a live demonstration. The presentation from Jobs stirred an audience of more than 3,000 people into a frenzy when the computer read aloud, "Hello, I'm Macintosh. It sure is great to get out of that bag."  http://appleinsider.com/articles/12/07/26/mountain_lion_easter_egg_references_debut_of_original_apple_macintosh  <comment238112> Although the article is referencing Mountain Lion nonetheless it's still applicable, have a look at: [Mountain Lion easter egg references debut of original Apple Macintosh](http://appleinsider.com/articles/12/07/26/mountain_lion_easter_egg_references_debut_of_original_apple_macintosh)
