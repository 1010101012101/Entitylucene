Restored my mac, lost a gesture <body> I used to have a gesture where I could place 2 fingers on the top bar of an application/a file  and use a third finger to drag it around. What gesture is this?  <answer267599> Found it. It's not a gesture but an Accessibility feature. Navigate to the screenshot shown below (codeSystem Preferences &gt; Accessibility &gt; Mouse &amp; Trackpad &gt; Trackpad Options.../code) and you can enable dragging from there.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zwD0S.png" alt=""  Switch it to codethree finger drag/code and your lost functionality will be restored.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dnI3I.png" alt=""  <comment335803> I think a one-finger click and drag will do, I don't think what you said is a real gesture. <comment335804> @owlswipe I found it. Its not a "gesture" per se, but an accessibility option. Settings - accessibility - Mouse/trackpad - trackpad options - enable dragging - 3 finger drag <comment335806> @Programatic Ah ok. Nice.
