How to get rid of "slide to reply" line in iOS 7 notifications? <body> When you have the screen locked on your iPhone, and you get a notification (like the Messages one shown below, minus the sender's name and icon) there is a line that says "slide to reply". This 'slide to reply' feature was there in iOS 6, and is common sense (to me), so I don't need this text taking up screen real estate.  How do you get rid of it?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Nv0UT.jpg" alt="Testing"
