Uninstalling Teamviewer Fully <body> I have been trying to remove teamviewer fully becuase of some leftover services trying to run the app (which've already been deleted a long time ago). I do run a codefind/code command to see what is left from teamviewer. See below;  precode&gt; sudo find / -name *teamviewer* Password:  /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.teamviewer.Helper.plist /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.teamviewer.teamviewer_service.plist /Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/com.teamviewer.Helper /private/var/db/BootCaches/FFFFEEEE-DDDD-CCCC-BBBB-AAAA000000F8/app.com.teamviewer.TeamViewer.playlist /private/var/db/receipts/com.teamviewer.teamviewer10.bom /private/var/db/receipts/com.teamviewer.teamviewer10.plist /private/var/db/receipts/com.teamviewer.teamviewer10Agent.bom /private/var/db/receipts/com.teamviewer.teamviewer10Agent.plist /private/var/db/receipts/com.teamviewer.teamviewer10AuthPlugin.bom /private/var/db/receipts/com.teamviewer.teamviewer10AuthPlugin.plist /private/var/db/receipts/com.teamviewer.teamviewer10Font.bom /private/var/db/receipts/com.teamviewer.teamviewer10Font.plist /private/var/db/receipts/com.teamviewer.teamviewer10Restarter.bom /private/var/db/receipts/com.teamviewer.teamviewer10Restarter.plist /private/var/db/receipts/com.teamviewer.teamviewer11.bom /private/var/db/receipts/com.teamviewer.teamviewer11.plist /private/var/db/receipts/com.teamviewer.teamviewer11Agent.bom /private/var/db/receipts/com.teamviewer.teamviewer11Agent.plist /private/var/db/receipts/com.teamviewer.teamviewer11AuthPlugin.bom /private/var/db/receipts/com.teamviewer.teamviewer11AuthPlugin.plist /private/var/db/receipts/com.teamviewer.teamviewer11Font.bom /private/var/db/receipts/com.teamviewer.teamviewer11Font.plist /private/var/db/receipts/com.teamviewer.teamviewer11PriviledgedHelper.bom /private/var/db/receipts/com.teamviewer.teamviewer11PriviledgedHelper.plist /private/var/db/receipts/com.teamviewer.teamviewer11Restarter.bom /private/var/db/receipts/com.teamviewer.teamviewer11Restarter.plist /private/var/db/receipts/com.teamviewer.teamviewer12.bom /private/var/db/receipts/com.teamviewer.teamviewer12.plist /private/var/db/receipts/com.teamviewer.teamviewer12Agent.bom /private/var/db/receipts/com.teamviewer.teamviewer12Agent.plist /private/var/db/receipts/com.teamviewer.teamviewer12AuthPlugin.bom /private/var/db/receipts/com.teamviewer.teamviewer12AuthPlugin.plist /private/var/db/receipts/com.teamviewer.teamviewer12Font.bom /private/var/db/receipts/com.teamviewer.teamviewer12Font.plist /private/var/db/receipts/com.teamviewer.teamviewer12PriviledgedHelper.bom /private/var/db/receipts/com.teamviewer.teamviewer12PriviledgedHelper.plist /private/var/db/receipts/com.teamviewer.teamviewer12Restarter.bom /private/var/db/receipts/com.teamviewer.teamviewer12Restarter.plist /private/var/db/receipts/com.teamviewer.teamviewer9.bom /private/var/db/receipts/com.teamviewer.teamviewer9.plist /private/var/db/receipts/com.teamviewer.teamviewer9Agent.bom /private/var/db/receipts/com.teamviewer.teamviewer9Agent.plist /private/var/db/receipts/com.teamviewer.teamviewer9Font.bom /private/var/db/receipts/com.teamviewer.teamviewer9Font.plist /Users/&lt;username&gt;/Library/Application Support/com.apple.sharedfilelist/com.apple.LSSharedFileList.ApplicationRecentDocuments/com.teamviewer.teamviewer.sfl /Users/&lt;username&gt;/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Local Storage/https_community.teamviewer.com_0.localstorage /Users/&lt;username&gt;/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Local Storage/https_community.teamviewer.com_0.localstorage-journal /code/pre  so the question is is it safe to remove all those files ( I believe so, but still need some experts' help).  <answer278188> If you just want to get rid of the services, removing  precode/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.teamviewer.Helper.plist /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.teamviewer.teamviewer_service.plist /code/pre  is enough.   Otherwise just remove them all.  <comment350068> Deleted, restarted and seems the os is ok. So no harm effect.
