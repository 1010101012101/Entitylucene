So what I did is:  h11. Go to codesystem preferences &gt; Internet Accounts &gt; Add other accounts/code/h1  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3z6c2.png" alt="enter image description here"  h12. Then select Mail Account/h1  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/efku9.png" alt="enter image description here"  That's it.  <comment333429> You can't add a hotmail account as Exchange..  Try the "outlook.com" type account or "other"... I can't test now, but hotmail is not Exchange type unless something changed recently... <comment333463> That did help actually, thanks! So what I did is to set up a not exchange account just a normal email and it did it magic.
