Changing the Key Modifiers (CMD<->CTRL) affects VM <body> I changed my kbd⌘CMD/kbd to behave like kbd⌃CTRL/kbd and kbd⌃CTRL/kbd to behave like a kbd⌘CMD/kbd, but this affects also my VirtualBox VM.  So I do kbd⌃CTRL/kbd+kbdC/kbd for Copy in Mac, but I gotta do kbd⌘CMD/kbd+kbdC/kbd to copy in Ubuntu...  That's pretty confusing, is there a way to go around this?  <answer144539> I saw that VMWare has this possibility, VirtualBox not.  I know use a headless VM (No GUI) so I use the OSX Terminal for all operations, behavior stays the same.
