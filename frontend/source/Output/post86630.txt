Is there a best / OSX-specific way to force all files created in a directory to have certain group ownership? <body> Basically I need any file emfilefoo/em that is newly created by emuserfoo/em or emuserbar/em, both members of emgroupfoo/em, in /Users/Shared/SpecialDirectory to have the same ownership that would be achieved by that user doing codechown whicheverusermadethefile:groupfoo filefoo/code after the fact.   (Longer story: I have two users running simultaneously on the same machine. The users have a shared folder at /Users/Shared/SpecialDirectory. These users, say emuserfoo/em and emuserbar/em, are both already members of a group emgroupfoo/em. emuserfoo/em syncs this directory using Dropbox, but Dropbox can't sync files downloaded by emuserbar/em into that directory b/c of permissions. File-by-file or a bunch at a time this problem can be solved with codechown/code and adding the right group ownership to the file or directory, but new downloads or additions continue to pose a problem. Thanks to some old tinkering with codeumask/code the files are created with the correct group permissions such that emuserfoo/em's Dropbox instance can read and sync them when their ownership is emanyuser:groupfoo/em, but the group itself is wrong because new file ownership defaults to emuserbar:staff/em instead of emuserbar:groupfoo/em.)  PS: This question is closest to the one I'm asking about, but the suggested solutions don't seem to apply since they don't ensure correct ownership of new files. Also, I could be wrong, but it looks like the questions here, here, and here aren't what I need, because the permissions are correct--it's the ownership that's wrong--and I need the fix to apply to any process creating any file (in particular b/c the bulk of these files-to-be-shared are pdfs downloaded by Chrome). This one also doesn't seem to do it--the directory itself is already owned by emuserfoo:groupfoo/em, yet new files created by emuserbar/em don't get the emgroupfoo/em gid.   <comment100162> I may be misunderstanding your question but does `chgrp groupfoo thedirectory; chmod g+s thedirectory` not have the desired effect? This sounds like the standard scenario for directories with the setgid bit set. I don't think you need ACLs for this. <comment102407> I think you're right and I'm an idiot and didn't check carefully enough what I had done. I need to wait a bit to ensure that this is right and then I'm going to flag my q or something b/c it would then be a clear dupe of the last link I cite. <comment103412> OK so I realized the issue--I download file `bar` in `~/downloads` and move to `/users/shared/specialdirectory` but `bar` doesn't then "inherit" the group newly created files in `specialdirectory` do. So this is not the question I asked, but it is the issue I meant to address. Any thoughts?
