Mac Book Air Suddenly Stutters On Video <body> I've got a MackBook Air running OS X 10.7.5 and a GoPro which produces code.mp4/code files.  After having issues with QuickTime playing code.mp4/code files, we installed VLC.  Things worked great, but all of a sudden, VLC skips and stutters when playing videos.  We've tried code.mp4/code and code.mov/code files.  Any idea if some file could have gotten corrupted somewhere? I've tried uninstalling and redownloading VLC.
