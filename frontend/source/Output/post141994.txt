Apple thinks I'm my father <body> My mac thinks I'm my father. When in automator I do this:  precode[get value of variable: name] --&gt; [new text file. Save as 'name.txt'. Location: desktop] /code/pre  it should put my name in a text file and put it on the desktop. But instead it puts my fathers name in there.  Why?  My Apple ID, iCloud account and all info on my mac and connected social media is on my name. But it still thinks I'm my father.  Could you please help?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/POE0g.png" alt="dutch version"  <answer142055> Check on the address book if your father's contact has codemyself: me/code assigned.  If it does, remove it and assign it in your contact.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/c3Xju.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment167315> If you go into the accounts pane in System Preferences and select your account, the Name field has your own name? <comment167316> Yes. Also on http://appleid.apple.com <comment167330> Can you poste more or your automator workflow? Where does 'Haal waarde van variablele op' ('Get Value of Variable') get it's input from? <comment167331> Just from the osx system I guess? <comment167332> Basicly the variable is the input and it puts it into a text file which is the output <comment167385> ill try tomorrow! <comment167454> What comes before "[get value of variable: name]" in this workflow? <comment167465> Nothing comes there <comment167466> yeah i switched the info and it worked!!! thanks!
