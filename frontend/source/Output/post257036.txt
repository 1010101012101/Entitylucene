Picture in Picture for quicktime? <body> I can't seem to find Picture-in-Picture (PiP) in QuickTime 10.4.  Is macOS Sierra's new PiP feature only for Safari?  <answer257039> QuickTime has had this feature for a while now, well before Sierra.  ol liOpen a video with QuickTime Player./li liView  Float on Top./li liRight-click or Control-click on the QuickTime Player icon in the Dock./li liOptions  Assign To: All Desktops. (This is available for any app.)/li /ol  <answer286908> A good solution is to simply drag a video file to the address bar in Safari and use its PIP feature.  <comment320761> Perfect! Just what I was looking for. <comment321053> Also, to answer your explicit question, PIP is specifically a feature of Safari and iTunes. <comment341126> Just for the record, this is not the same feature. PIP floats above desktops so when switching spaces it is still in the corner of the screen, whereas in quicktime the floating window is still fixed to a space. <comment341779> To add to the previous comment by @GeorgeGreen: you can work around this limitation by right-clicking QuickTimeâ€™s Dock icon, clicking options, and assigning it to "all desktops". <comment345374> While it is not the same feature, it definitely fulfills a similar end-result that many users may be looking for.
