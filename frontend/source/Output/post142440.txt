Mac thinks mouse is a keyboard <body> Whenever I plug in my usb wireless mouse, my Macbook Air and Mac Pro both think that the mouse is a keyboard and won't register the mouse's movements at all. Is there a way to fix this?  The mouse is a cheapy Gigaware wireless usb mouse and I'm running OS X Mavericks.  <answer282901> This restored the default mouse behavior for me, though it looks like I had a different problem.  ol liOpen keyboard settings in System Preferences  Keyboard/li liClick codeModifier Keys.../code button in bottom right of panel/li liSelect your mouse from the dropdown/li liClick codeRestore Defaults/code button to restore default behavior./li /ol  If that doesn't work, you might also try these instructions for removing your keyboard profiles and then restarting.  <comment167835> Where are you being informed that it is a keyboard? <comment356569> Have you tried the mouse on other computers?
