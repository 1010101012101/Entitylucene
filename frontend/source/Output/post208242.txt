All-Day Events in iOS 9 Today <body> When I pull down the Notification Center, the "Today" view seems to exclude emall-day/em events.  For example, I have 2 events for today:  ol li"Lunch", scheduled at noon/li li"Ask A Stupid Question Day", an all-day event/li /ol  My iOS9 Today view says      Wednesday, September 30th      The first thing on your calendar today is "Lunch", in 46 minutes.   If I delete "Lunch" from my calendar, the Today view simply says     Wednesday, September 30th   Why doesn't an all-day event get the same respect as a normal event? Can I change this (stupid) behavior? Am I missing something?  Note: I'm not talking about the Notification Center's Calendar widget (although, it too doesn't not display my all-day event. I guess at least my all-day event is being emconsistently/em ignored).  <answer208246> All-day events don't show in Notification Center.  You can provide feedback to Apple here:  ul lihttp://www.apple.com/feedback/iphone.html/li /ul  <comment251425> That's what I suspected. Thanks for verifying. My feedback is: "that sucks." I'll let apple know at the link you provided - thanks!
