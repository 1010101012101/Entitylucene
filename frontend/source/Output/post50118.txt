Requirements for using iOS Simulator? <body> Does anyone know what the requirements for running the iOS Simulator? I've got a MacBook running 10.6.8 and ADmitMac 6. Whenever I'm logged in as Active Domain user (that has no /Users account on the machine) the simulator crashes upon startup. Actually kernel panics, forces a machine restart. But when I use a user that has a /Users account (admin or not) the simulator runs without error.  <comment57435> Do you mean Active Directory user? <comment57436> Xcode and iOS simulator version? (the requirements for each varies depending what you might be running) Do read through the FAQ - many developer specific questions we prefer to have on stack overflow - but some basic ones like this can find a nice home here. Especially if you are using the App Store version of Xcode. (and not the developer versions) <comment57532> bmike: Versions: XCode 4.2, iOS simulator 5.0.  Aaron: Yeah, Active Directory. Too many acronyms...
