Your computer may be set to disconnect automatically If you have to redial your dial-up modem Internet connection after not using your Mac for a few moments, or reconnect your PPPoE connection, your Mac may be set to disconnect automatically when the connection is idle.  1.Choose Apple menu  System Preferences, then click Network.  2.Select your modem port (internal or external) or your PPPoE configuration      in the list at the left, then click Advanced.  3.Click PPP, then make sure “Prompt every __ minutes to maintain  connection” is not selected, or if it is selected, increase the number of minutes that the computer can remain idle before disconnecting.  <comment309534> I could see such a configuration in Network. <comment309535> Surely that's only if the mac is connected directly to the ISP equipment and bypassing the router entirely? As I understand it, Dinesh is having trouble with his wifi not reconnecting after his mac wakes...? <comment309537> Have you tried these steps Dinesh?

It doesn't seems to work. <comment309757> Have you investigated what the command line tool `airport` can do for you? It has a few more options than those that are available in the GUI: https://www.itdojo.com/osx-airport-cli-tool-not-just-for-airport-aps/ I've had good results occasionally with the tool. <comment348565> I've been having the same problem since a few years with my mid 2014 macbook, now running Sierra. I tried every solution I could find, and although it seems fixed sometimes, the problem always comes back. I recently did a clean (not TM restore) install of my macbook as a last resort, and it didn't help -_-
