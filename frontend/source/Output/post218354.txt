How to prevent iPhone from dropping wifi connection when it goes to sleep? <body> I am using whatsapp web version and the iPhone needs to be connected at all times for it to work. However, when the iPhone goes to sleep (screen goes off) the wifi connected is automatically turned off to save battery and the whatsapp on my browser disconnects. Is there a way to force iPhone to keep wifi connection up when locked and/or asleep?  <answer233813> Change wifi setting password from WPA 2 to WPA. Hope that works.  <answer233826> I have the same iPhone and the same problem. I just went into Settings  General  Reset  Reset Network Settings. Then reconnect to your wifi like normal.   This worked for me, however if the problem is still there, maybe turn your data off when using wifi. Hope one method works for you (:  <answer238030> Setting my network's codeAuto Login/code to codeOn/code seems to have solved the issue for me.  img src="https://img.tapatalk.com/d/13/01/29/a7y9uput.jpg" alt=""  source  <answer251635> If you have the ability to leave your iPhone plugged in, try that. I believe the radios remain powered on when your device is connected to a power source.  If that fails, disable Auto-Lock as well.  If those are not an option, I’m afraid you’re out of luck.  <answer276102> I had this problem at my local school where every time I locked my iPod I lost connection to wifi, so I developed an app called 'Constant WiFi' which keeps me connected even if my iPod is locked. I am not familiar with 'whatsapp' but my app forces the wifi to stay connected when the device is locked or asleep. If you decide to try the app I hope it works for you!  <comment263966> It should be connected until you go out of your router's range or manually disconnect. This is a non-Jailbroken Apple iPhone, correct? <comment263969> non-jailbroken. But you are mistaken. It disconnects the wifi when it goes to sleep to save battery. I am positive about it. <comment263971> What version of iOS is it running and which iPhone is it? <comment263974> lastest version iphone 6s <comment263975> Very strange, I've never heard of anything like this happening before. Does it only disconnect in Low Power Mode or all the time? <comment263977> http://forums.macrumors.com/threads/wifi-disconnects-when-locked.1454385/ <comment263978> I'd give Apple support a call and see what they say. <comment355777> Not sure why this answer is so much downvoted. But for me this solution works!
