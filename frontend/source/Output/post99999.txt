MacBook Air Backlit Keys Not Adjusting <body> I have the codeAdjust keyboard brightness in low light/code option selected but this just isn't working correctly.   The screen brightness adjust automatically (i.e. I put my thumb over the webcam and the screen dims, I point a light at the webcam and the screen brightness increases), but the keyboard either does nothing, OR only turns on when in bright rooms. When I turn off all the lights the keys go off.  Is there any way to adjust this and make it work properly?  <comment117675> i had a similar problem, and the only fix i had was to backup and reinstall the OS <comment136958> Now your keys work correctly? I've never seen it work right on any MacBook.
