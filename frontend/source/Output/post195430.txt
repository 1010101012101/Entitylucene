How do I reclaim 36 GB of missing space on my iPhone? <body> I have a 64GB iPhone 5S with iOS 8.4, but I'm only able to access 28 GB of space.  iTunes reports a capacity of 55.92GB, but in the usage graph at the bottom of the summary page, I see:  ul li13.61 GB Free/li li1.58 GB Other/li li1.09 GB Documents &amp; Data/li li5.13 GB Apps/li li248.3 MB Photos/li li6.34 GB Audio/li /ul  The Setting-Usage-Storage app says:  ul liUsed: 42.9 GB/li liAvailable 13.0 GB/li /ul  I've tried rebooting and updating the OS from 8.3 to 8.4.   I'm hoping to avoid a solution that involves wiping the phone and resetting it. Is there anything else I can do to reclaim my missing 36 GB of space?  <answer195985> You said you don't want to wipe the phone and reset it, but what about restoring it from a backup? During an iCloud restore, iOS re-downloads most of what it needs from Apple’s servers, so the process might reclaim your lost space, since iOS wouldn’t assign it to anything that isn't actually using it. After the restore, your phone would be returned to the same state you left it in.  <comment233283> On the phone go to Settings  General  Usage  Manage Storage and see what you learn there. <comment233455> I did; the result is in the original question. Besides listing my apps and the amount of space taken by each it says I'm using 42.9 GB and and have available 13 GB. The usage summary adds up basically to what iTunes reports. <comment233467> Don't just look at the totals from the phone tho, the detail shown there is much more accurate than iTunes. <comment233469> Adding up the total space used by the apps from that list is similar to what iTunes reports for used space. It does not account for the missing storage.
