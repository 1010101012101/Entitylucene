How to change language of a single Mac app on Sierra? <body> On previously Mac OS X version is was possible to change a single application to a different language via Terminal using a freeware application (Language Switcher and App Language Chooser), but I can't seem to get it to work on Sierra anymore.  <answer274612> One way to do this is to go into the app (control click, show package contents, contents, resources) and switch the names of the .lproj files, so that the one corresponding to your OS language actually contains the data for the language you want the app to display in.  <answer286341> Language Switcher works even on Sierra.  http://download.cnet.com/Language-Switcher/3000-2094_4-10958109.html  <comment345368> This won't work sadly. All the folder are empty so chancing the folder name won't do the trick. I even contacted the developer for a language switch, but that's not in there roadmap.. <comment345386> @Hamkaastosti  So the app has only been created with one language?  That is really unusual these days. <comment361252> But it won't work in this case because the app has never been localized in the desired language. <comment361256> If this is only temporary you can launch the app via terminal like `some.app/Contents/MacOS/executable -AppleLanguages '(en)'`. <comment361257> @TomGewecke isnâ€™t this going to break the codesign? <comment361259> @MateuszSzlosek I have not heard of anyone having a problem with that so far. <comment367865> I can select the desired language in language switcher. But it won't change it.. Its the app 'WhatsApp'
