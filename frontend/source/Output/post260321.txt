How to install VLC Player on the original iPad (iOS 5.1.1)? <body> My friend has the original iPad that runs iOS 5.1.1 and can't be updated any further. Very few apps these days are compatible with that version of iOS. The new version of VLC in the App Store requires iOS 7.  What I thought I'd do is get an old version of the code.ipa/code for VLC that's compatible with iOS 5.1.1. I have a computer with iTunes that I wonder if I can use to transfer it to the iPad.  ol liAre some old versions of VLC compatible with iOS 5.1.1? If yes, what's the latest VLC version that's compatible?/li liWhere can I get such code.ipa/code files?/li liDo I have to jailbreak the iPad in order to install such downloaded files, or can I do it without jailbreaking?/li /ol  <answer260330> version 2.2.x is what you need.  The latest with 5.1 support according to wiki: https://wiki.videolan.org/Documentation:IOS/#Feature_Overview  Download away! Vlc keeps all the different versions! http://downloads.videolan.org/videolan/vlc-iOS/  No Jailbreak required.  <comment325888> for instructions on how to install the package, see this question: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20160285/install-ipa-to-ipad-with-or-without-itunes <comment327484> This actually didn't work, the app failed to install no matter which version I selected. But I managed to do it using [this method](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/144924/153510).
