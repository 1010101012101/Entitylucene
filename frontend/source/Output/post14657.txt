curl gives error - possibly fink related? <body> When I try and run codecurl/code in the OS X Terminal I get the following error:  precodedyld: Library not loaded: /usr/local/lib/libcurl.4.dylib   Referenced from: /usr/local/bin/curl   Reason: Incompatible library version: curl requires version 7.0.0 or later, but libcurl.4.dylib provides version 5.0.0 Trace/BPT trap /code/pre  I have a suspicion this is something to do with fink - as I installed a number of things from fink. However, I have tried removing and reinstalling curl with fink and it still refuses to work. I can't seem to get it to find a correct version of libcurl whatever I do.  Any ideas? strongUpdate:/strong Output of running codeenv/code in the terminal is below:  precodeMANPATH=/sw/share/man:/usr/local/share/man:/Library/Frameworks/EPD64.framework/Versions/Current/share/man:/usr/share/man:/usr/local/git/share/man:/usr/texbin/man:/usr/X11/man:/sw/lib/perl5/5.10.0/man:/usr/X11R6/man TERM_PROGRAM=Apple_Terminal TERM=xterm-color SHELL=/bin/bash CLICOLOR=1 TMPDIR=/var/folders/+w/+wmZARshFrCjcx1M3ByCFk+++TQ/-Tmp-/ PERL5LIB=/sw/lib/perl5:/sw/lib/perl5/darwin Apple_PubSub_Socket_Render=/tmp/launch-E8utdf/Render TERM_PROGRAM_VERSION=273.1 USER=robin COMMAND_MODE=unix2003 SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/tmp/launch-nlYhE5/Listeners __CF_USER_TEXT_ENCODING=0x1F7:0:0 PATH=/sw/bin:/sw/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:/Users/robin/todo:/Applications/TeXCount:/Applications/latexmk:/usr/local/Cellar/gettext/0.17/bin/:/Library/Frameworks/EPD64.framework/Versions/Current/bin:/Library/Frameworks/GDAL.framework/Versions/1.7/Programs/:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/Applications/itt/idl71/bin:/usr/local/git/bin:/usr/texbin:/usr/X11/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin MKL_NUM_THREADS=1 PWD=/Users/robin/builds/ridl LANG=en_GB.UTF-8 AUTOJUMP_DATA_DIR=/Users/robin/.local/share/autojump SHLVL=1 HOME=/Users/robin DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=:/Applications/itt/idl71/bin/bin.darwin.x86_64 PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/lib/python: LOGNAME=robin PROMPT_COMMAND=: &amp;&amp; { (autojump -a "$(pwd -P)"&amp;)&gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&gt;${AUTOJUMP_DATA_DIR}/.autojump_errors;} 2&gt;/dev/null INFOPATH=/sw/share/info:/sw/info:/usr/share/info DISPLAY=/tmp/launch-RRRwWC/org.x:0 _=/usr/bin/env OLDPWD=/Users/robin/builds/ridl/CMake /code/pre  <comment15774> What is the output of 'env' in your terminal? Looks like your environment is picking up the built-in version of libcurl first (/usr/lib/libcurl.4.dylib), which is used by /usr/bin/curl, whereas the fink version of curl really wants something newer (presumably from /usr/local/lib). If so, I'm not sure why it's not just ignoring the first, too-old version that it finds, though. <comment15777> @Calum - I've added the output to the end of my question. Cheers. <comment15778> @Calum Oh, and interestingly, if I run `/usr/bin/curl` I get the same error. Looks like the version in /usr/lib isn't right either! <comment15779> Hmm, probably needs more of a Unix-head to step in at this point! As a matter of interest, what does '/usr/bin/curl --version' show? It should show v7.19.7, for OS X 10.6.7.  You might also want to try temporarily unsetting DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH, just to see what happens -- I always try not to set it unless I really need it for the job at hand, as it can cause this sort of issue too. <comment15780> @Calum Ah - great! Unsetting DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH seemed to do the trick. Thanks. Do you want to put that as an answer so I can upvote it and mark it as accepted? <comment15782> I dount this is Fink as Fink installs in /sw not /usr/local. /usr/local would be for installs direct from source or other direct installs - I also note /opt/local/bin which is usually macports - only use one ports as they aren't tested with others (given that path have you used homebrew for anything as that could be the source of curl)
