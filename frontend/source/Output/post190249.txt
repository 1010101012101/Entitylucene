Restoring Fusion Drive after error on partition erase <body> I think I'm lost and need some help with my Fusion Drive. I have new iMac Retina 5k with 3TB Fusion Drive and preinstalled Yosemite.  Things I did so far:  ol liI was working on my iMac and had successfully deployed Bootcamp partition with Windows 7 (120gb). Everything went well, but after some time, the Win7 partition filled up so I decided to find a way to make it larger. Moral of the story is 'don't change something that works'. /li liAfter some Googling I've found that nothing but removing and reinstalling Bootcamp worked in that matter./li liI backed up my Win7 partition with Clonezilla and than removed it with BA./li liStarted BA anew, made new partition (399gb), new installation USB flash drive than restarted to install with same BA./li liWindows 7 installation started, found new and empty BOOTCAMP partition but couldn't install Win7 on it, formatting it didn't help (later I found that it was caused by my external HDD plugged in)./li liRestarted to OSX. Then the bad things started to happen./li liIn DU I clicked Erase on BOOTCAMP partition, it gave me an error and BOOTCAMP partiton disappeared. It still showed on Disk view as unallocated space./li liI thought that removing what left from Bootcamp partition and expanding current CS to full size would enable BA partition splitting again./li liI went along these steps Restore Macintosh HD to its original partition configuration inal-partition-configuration/li liIt didn't work. In a last frantic attempt, I deleted whole cs, but it didn't fix to a new Fusion Drive./li /ol  So now I'm stuck with scrambled fusion drive and don't know what to do. I want to restore Fusion Drive to original, unsliced state and than put working Bootcamp partition there.  Here is screenshot from DU in debug mode (sorry it's in polish) are listings for various diskutil commands in terminal:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4BpFE.jpg" alt="Disk Utility screenshot" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Qqn4c.jpg" alt="More Disk Utility details"  diskutil list  precode/dev/disk0    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *121.3 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:                  Apple_HFS SSD                     121.0 GB   disk0s2 /dev/disk1    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *3.0 TB     disk1    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk1s1    2:          Apple_CoreStorage                         1.8 TB     disk1s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk1s3 /dev/disk2    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:     Apple_partition_scheme                        *1.3 GB     disk2    1:        Apple_partition_map                         30.7 KB    disk2s1    2:                  Apple_HFS OS X Base System        1.3 GB     disk2s2 /dev/disk3    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                  Apple_HFS Untitled               *1.8 TB     disk3                                  Logical Volume on disk1s2                                  8FDEBC56-0DCC-4A11-83A2-ACC38C44ABC0                                  Unencrypted /dev/disk4    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                            untitled               *5.2 MB     disk4 /dev/disk5    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                            untitled               *524.3 KB   disk5 /dev/disk6    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                            untitled               *524.3 KB   disk6 /dev/disk7    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                            untitled               *524.3 KB   disk7 /dev/disk8    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                            untitled               *524.3 KB   disk8 /dev/disk9    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                            untitled               *524.3 KB   disk9 /dev/disk10    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                            untitled               *6.3 MB     disk10 /dev/disk11    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                            untitled               *2.1 MB     disk11 /dev/disk12    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                            untitled               *1.0 MB     disk12 /dev/disk13    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                            untitled               *524.3 KB   disk13 /dev/disk14    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                            untitled               *524.3 KB   disk14 /dev/disk15    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                            untitled               *1.0 MB     disk15 /dev/disk16    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                            untitled               *6.3 MB     disk16 /code/pre  diskutil cs list  precodeCoreStorage logical volume groups (1 found) | +-- Logical Volume Group 4D59CB69-60DE-49BB-8450-B573CD66DA1B     =========================================================     Name:         Untitled     Status:       Online     Size:         1799162331136 B (1.8 TB)     Free Space:   7237632 B (7.2 MB)     |     +-&lt;

I suspect what's happened is your Mac cannot recognize the NTFS formatted portion of the disk.   Reboot while holding Alt + Cmd + R for Internet Recovery Mode. Go to Utilities  Terminal, and in terminal type: diskutil cs list, then find the UUID under "Logical Volume Group" with the missing space, copy it, and paste it after: diskutil cs delete. Go back to Disk Utility. At the prompt, click "OK" to repair your Fusion Drive. Exit Disk Utility, reboot (to the recovery partition if it doesn't automatically, to Internet Recovery Mode, or using a recovery USB drive) and reinstall OS X. When that finishes: If you plan on restoring from a Time Machine backup, you may have to create a new User and recover your old account logged in as the new one. If this does not work, you may have to manually reformat each drive, and proceed from step one.   <comment225787> @IconDaemon thank You, English is not my first language.
