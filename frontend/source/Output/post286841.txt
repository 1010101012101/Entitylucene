Calculate sum of true/false checkbox cells <body> I can add true/false buttons ok. I wish to have these buttons equal a number when it's ticked then be added to a total.  I'm brand new to numbers but finding my way ok so far. I do team sheets. Each member pays £2 I wish to just use a tick box to confirm they have paid then total what the true buttons.  Can it be done?  <answer286842> To calculate the sum of the checkboxes, where checked is 1 and unchecked is 0, use:  precode=COUNTIF(A, true) /code/pre  Replace A with the range of cells where the checkboxes are.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GNAd9.png" width="510"  You can combine this with ×2 to multiply the answer by 2, then format as currency.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GG6Iq.png" width="510"  <comment362049> I've edited your title to be more specific to your actual problem, but feel free to [edit] further if you feel this is not representative of your problem. <comment362061> I am almost getting there. do I have to the formula again for rack checkbox? <comment362062> @The I'm don't understand your question, the formula is input once into the cell. What's a ‘rack checkbox’? <comment362066> Yes I'm sorry. I should have checked text correctly. I can type first line of formula and It works. True checkbox = 2. I am now trying to repeat for all checkboxes. So trying to work that out just now. <comment362067> @The Why are you repeating the formula for each checkbox? The first parameter to countif takes a *range* of checkboxes and sums the checked cells. <comment362102> Ok! New day! New learning. Thankyou firstly for your help. I Have managed now.
