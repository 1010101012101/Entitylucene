Is there any way to print to an old Diablo-command-set parallel printer from a modern Mac? <body> This question is mostly about software. There exist many hardware adapters that allow one to connect a parallel printer to the USB port on a Mac, but I can't find any way to stream text to the adapter such that it actually prints. Has anybody been able to do this?  <answer291126> I figured out how to make it work from the terminal using a standard USB/parallel adapter.

Do you have one ? <comment121385> That's just restating my question. Does there exist a printer driver for Diablo-command-set printers?
