Feasible to check out XML file from QuickLook? <body> How can I use QuickLook to check out XML file? I just want to quickly check out the contents of a file and don't have to open it in a format that can be subsequently modified, such as in TextEdit or Vim or whatever other editors out there. I even don't like to open it in Xcode using drag and drop - just want to push kbdSpace/kbd and glance at the contents there.  And it looks like QLStephen doesn't support XML/plist files. So is there any alternative way to glance at it from QuickLook?  I use OS X 10.9.2.  <answer124635> CED Lecca's ColorXML QuickLook appears to offer what you need. I am not sure if it works with OS X 10.9.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yA9oM.png" alt="ColorXML QuickLook"  Brian Oliver's article, OS X Leopard: Extending Quick Look to support XML, links to other sources for useful QuickLook plug-ins.  <answer124636> When installing Textmate 2 you get QuickLook support for a bunch of data files including XML, Json etc.   <comment145795> I also recommend QLColorCode to color syntax other files aside XML: https://code.google.com/p/qlcolorcode/ <comment145796> Does this work in Mavericks too? I just installed it, was able to open the App, but still cannot open XML files from QuickLook... <comment145797> Yep, i'm running it in Mavericks. Did you make TextMate your default App to open XML ? <comment145798> Installed it and executed `qlmanage -r` to reload QuickLook settings, but it didn't work in my case. Also rebooted but still not working... <comment145799> Just make it the default app but still cannot open. Also, I don't like the idea of setting it as default. Do you use QLStephen? I wonder if it conflicts with TextMate... <comment145912> After I installed QLColorCode, for some reasons it worked. Ditching TextMate being default editor still works.
