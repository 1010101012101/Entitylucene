Back up a network share with time capsule <body> I have a TimeCapsule with a 8TB drive in it.  I have an iMac, a MacBook and a ubuntu server, that has the latest version of netatalk/avahi  for AFP sharing.  I want to store my Photos and Movies folders on the ubuntu server because it has a huge RAID in it, and I can then use photos across my macbook etc.  I think Time Capsule backups are neat.  Is there a way I can backup an attached network volume to be backed up to the time capsule, or would it be better to just rsync the files across on a daily basis and not have an historical backup?  Thanks for reading.  <comment282488> Does the backup include your network share when you mount it? <comment282644> It does not, hence the question....
