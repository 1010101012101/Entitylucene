Terminal path bar style for prompt <body> I recently saw this in a demonstration online in someones Terminal:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pPTzi.png" alt="Path bar image"  Notice the path-bar-like style of the prompt, any ideas how you can get that? Some kind of customisation I'd assume?  <answer96161> The prompt is defined by the PS1 environment variable which you can define in your ~/.profile file.  For example to make it simply a "$" put this line in your .profile:  precodeexport PS1="$" /code/pre  Then "source" (codesource ~/.profile/code) the file to make the changes active if you've edited it in a terminal or just open a new Terminal.  Details of the fancy special things you can insert there can be found by searching PS1, a good set of examples can be found at The Geek Stuff most examples are for Linux but it's nearly the same (possibly identical not 100% sure though)  <answer96162> You're looking for Powerline which originally came about as a Vim plugin (although the bash version has a different author). You need patched fonts to deal with the symbols. Like these  Edit:  This screenshot is also using the Solarized theme I believe.  <comment112889> That looks like it, any idea what theme it is? <comment112903> @Joshua see edit, my theme of choice as well <comment173378> https://gist.github.com/dcondrey/f1187c2f7f51ed8daf85
