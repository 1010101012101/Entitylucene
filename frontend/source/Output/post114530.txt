10.9: "Application cannot be found" on Windows 2012 R2 shares <body> We recently migrated from Snow Leopard Server to a Windows 2012 R2 server. In the process we upgraded our Prepress department to 10.9, in an effort to avoid purchasing ExtremeZ-IP.  For the most part everything has been going smoothly. However, on three machines we have a recurring issue where PDFs will refuse to open from the network volume. The message "The application cannot be found" appears, whether we attempt to open the PDF in Acrobat, or Preview. Quicklook also doesn't work.  Running Onyx, followed by a reboot, seems to fix the problem. However, now it is has re-occurred on one machine, and I expect it to happen on more.  Switching to CIFS (SMB1) solves the problem. However, performance is severely impacted due to the large size of our server file system. The new SMB2 code in Mavericks really is much faster.
