What is a good RAW File Processor/Developer/Editor for Mac? <body> What is a good quality, and ideally free or cheap, RAW file processor for Mac OS X 10.7? Until I switched to Mac from Ubuntu, I used RawTherapee, which served me well, but unfortunately it's not supported on Lion.  Ideally I'd prefer not splashing out on a pro-level graphics suite; I just want some basic abilities like exposure/color adjustment, aligning, etc. - with output to .JPG. If the tool also has a general photo management capability, great, but I can live without that.  I'm struggling to find anything that quite meets what I'm looking for. I tried Raw Photo Processor, but the interface is cumbersome and confusing.  <answer52639> h2Apple iPhoto '11/h2  Let's not forget that Apple iPhoto '11 costs $15 in the Mac App Store, and that it has processing tools for RAW as well as frequently-updated profiles for working with many makes and models of cameras that produce RAW image files.  h2Google Picasa/h2  Google Picasa is free and supports many RAW formats.  h2Canon Digital Photo Professional/h2  version 3.11.26 is compatible with Mac OS X Lion. If you already own an earlier version that came with your Canon camera, you can download the updater from canon.com for free. Otherwise, here is how you can get it:  Canon Digital Photo Professional comes on a CD with a suite of programs called strongCanon Digital Camera Solutions Disk/strong ver. 38.1.  I recently bought a used Canon Powershot G10 whose seller did not provide the original software sold with a new Canon. So I called up Canon's customer service, explained that I bought a used Canon, and asked them if I could purchase their tools on CD. They sold me the suite for US strong$20/strong plus tax and shipping (it came to strong$27/strong).      ...you may purchase the latest Canon Digital Camera Software Solutions   disc for your camera through Canon USA's Customer Support Center at   1-800-828-4040. Residents of other countries should contact their   regional Canon customer support center for further assistance.   I installed the whole suite on Mac OS X Lion, then downloaded the latest updates from canonusa.com to make sure they were compatible with Lion.   The suite includes strongCanon Digital Photo Professional/strong, for processing RAW images, a batch-file processing utility called strongCanon Digital Photo Professional Batch/strong, the strongCanon Image Browser/strong for general photo management, and strongPhotostitch/strong for making panoramas.  <comment59288> What kind of camera do you have? Canon and Nikon ship their own RAW processing tools with their cameras. I can't stand them but they're free. <comment59293> Aperture from the Mac App Store is not free, but very affordable and good value for money. <comment60192> Canon 400D, but it's sufficiently old I suspect the RAW tools aren't supported on Lion. <comment60212> Apple's [Camera RAW](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4757) claims D400 support in OS X 10.7.
