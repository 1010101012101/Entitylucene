Connect AB-330m to my ipod/iphone over BlueTooth <body> I have an AB-330m wireless printer, that uses BlueTooth, but on my iPod touch, iPhone 6 and iPhone 7 it does not show up when I search for BlueTooth devices. On my iMac, Windows PC and my Android phone it does show up when I search for BlueTooth devices.   Anyone know why I cannot see it, and if the is a way to see the device.   <comment363617> You'll want to check this article https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201311
