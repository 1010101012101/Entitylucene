Messages: iCloud sync stuck on "synchronizing" with iOS 11 Beta <body> I turned on Messages on iCloud from my MacBook Pro with the last public beta of High Sierra and everything worked well. Every message was updated and I can see 15GB of iCloud storage used up by them. So I wanted to turn them on on my iPhone 5S with the last public iOS 11 beta too.  Since all messages were on iCloud, I restored my iPhone and cleanly installed the public iOS beta. But when I activate the iCloud sync, it tells me "synchronizing 0 messages with iCloudâ€¦" and remains like this for ever. I then tried to send some messages from the iPhone and now it is stuck on "synchronizing 70 messages with iCloud". The same thing I get within the Messages app.  Are there any workarounds for this? I read of people peacefully using this feature and I'd like to use it too.
