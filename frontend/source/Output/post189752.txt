Why is it that my MacBook Pro Retina's resolution is detected as different based on the application? <body> The actual advertized resolution is 2880 x 1800.br Taking a fullscreen, screenshot gives me an image that is 2880 x 1800.br Going to this site tells me my resolution is 1440 x 900.br The built in Digital Color Meter tells me my resolution is 1440 x 900.br This bit of Java code:   precodeDimension screenSize = Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().getScreenSize(); double width = screenSize.getWidth(); double height = screenSize.getHeight(); System.out.println(width + " x " + height); /code/pre  has an output of 1440 x 900.  So why is this and how do I fix it?  <answer189761> I am an iOS developer, so have a bit of an idea what is causing this.  Apple measure screen size in empoints/em rather than empixels/em, and depending on whether your screen is a retina display or not, will change the scaling factor between empoints/em and physical pixels.  In your case, because you have a high-resolution Retina display, OS X is applying a scale factor of 2.0.  This means that a webpage that has been designed with an element 500px across will still appear the right physical size (however it will in fact be 1000px across).  It's not a bug, it's a feature that means the retina display can still show the "old-fashioned" normal resolution content.  <comment225119> Which site is that - a link without explaination is not something anyone should click on. Also which version of Java? <comment225121> Sorry about that. The site is http://www.whatismyscreenresolution.com/ which just displays your screen resolution. I'm using Java 8 Update 45.
