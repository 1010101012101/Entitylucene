Where is the MacBook Air (13") Mid 2012 fan exhaust? <body> I would like to put a plastic dust cover on my MacBook Air, but I'm not sure whether it would obstruct the fan exhaust.  Below is a drawing that shows the soft cover.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VLYN6.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  I know someone that would make it for me from the material in those plastic bags with zipper, like the one below.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fgxtZ.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer120772> It should be directly in the back, toward the bottom (across almost the entire machine). Look for the black plastic strip across the back.
