Permanently enable Swapfiles and allocate RAM to virtual video memory <body> I have the following current setup:  /Volumes/Swap (8092MB) HFS+, Journaled  /Volumes/moOS (macOS 10.13 beta 3) (~100GB) HFS+, Journaled   in the /Volumes/Swap I have already correctly configured /.vm/swapfile? where ? is the swapfile number (from 0-7) and I can see as I add more processes that more swapfiles are created as needed until swapfile7 is created and deletes as needed until the files are not needed.  What I want to do essentially is make all 8 of the swapfiles active permanently such that they are all available under /.vm/ and thus in iStatsMenus I can see all of them at once under the Swap Memory (i.e. 0KB used of 8.0GB for Swap Memory). My main purpose for doing this is to then somehow find out how to allocate additional RAM to my Intel 520 HD Graphics. It currently tells me it's 1536MB but I have previously been able to achieve 4155MB on a Windows 10 partition and I would like to do this so my Experience with Final Cut Pro feels more smooth and faster (knowing it'll still be sluggish since my system is a laptop and therefor inherently less superior than an iMacPro)
