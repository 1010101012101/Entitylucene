How do I identify which preference panes are 32bit and which aren't <body> Recently my sound preference pane has asked to reopen System Preferences when I select it, or when I switch away from it. I have added a few panes, like Wacom, and an Xbox controller pane. Possibly it's sound flower doing this though.  I'd like to know how to identify all the 32 bit vs 64 bit panes so that I can start uninstalling the ones I don't find necessary any longer and hopefully streamline this.  <comment317139> Not really an answer, but might help - You can see which processes are 32-bit in Activity Monitor [Apps/Utilities], in the CPU column. You could use a process of elimination, perhaps. <comment317803> @Tetsujin unfortunately only one process in Activity Monitor shows for the System Preferences, and it switches from 64 to 32 bit every time it prompts to do so. <comment317806> ah, sorry. I've no idea then. Hope someone comes up with something useful for you.
