Is there a way to display audio bitrate in Finder? <body> I want to have a quick and easy way to check bitrate of compressed audio files, without having to open iTunes/Quicktime etc.  Either a Finder option (Get info/Inspector/List view) or perhaps an AppleScript via Right click  Service would do, via output to Terminal or system pop-up.  Are there any established solutions out there, or will we have to look at a scripting solution?  <answer253110> You could fashion a service in Automator using the Terminal.app and your shell with something like:  precodemdls -name kMDItemTotalBitRate file /code/pre  <comment315790> Tried to get it running as an Automator Service using Applescript, but couldn't get it to output the result to a message box/terminal. Looking for advice on this. <comment315897> @Winterflags Sorry, I'm not an applescripter but I think you would set a variable to the results of `do shell script mdls .....`  and then display the variable in a dialog box.
