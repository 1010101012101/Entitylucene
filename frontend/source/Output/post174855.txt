Macbook Pro low battery warning to instant recharge <body> My Macbook Pro (Mid 2012, OSX 10.10.2) sometimes gives the codeLow Battery/code warning, then immediately after dismissing the notification the battery pops back up to about 25% battery, still showing a red battery icon.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RFl4p.png" alt="It is above 20% but is still red."  strongIt is above 20% but is still red./strong  emWhat could have caused this, is it an error in Yosemite OS X, or is it a reserve battery power I did not know about, or is it something completely different/em  <answer174863> That is your battery it self, acting up.  Following the SMC reset I would recommend a single (one time) deep discharge.  The deep discharge will reset the Battery values reported.  Just leave your computer running till it shuts down by it self due to low power.
