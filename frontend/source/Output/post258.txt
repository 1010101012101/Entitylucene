Mac ports installation of gcc46 failing due to architecture problems <body> When trying to install codegcc46/code on OS X 10.6.4 using codeport/code (MacPorts 1.9.1) i get the following errors:  precodeartemis:foo$ sudo port install gcc46 Error: Cannot install gcc46 for the arch(s) 'x86_64' because Error: its dependency gmp is only installed for the arch 'i386' Error: and the configured universal_archs 'ppc i386' are not sufficient. Error: Unable to execute port: architecture mismatch /code/pre  MacPorts was freshly installed on the 10.6 system.  Any suggestions on how to resolve this or how to install gcc46 for i386?  em(Previously asked and as of now unanswered on SuperUser.)/em  <answer280> Try installing first gmp only with the codeuniversal/code variant :     sudo port install gmp +universal   Then reinstall gcc46.  <answer371> For some reason the codeuniversal_archs/code configurations was wrong. An answer on SuperUser now worked:  ul liin code/opt/local/etc/macports//code copy codemacports.conf.default/code to codemacports.conf/code/li limake sure codeuniversal_archs/code in it is set to codex86_64 i386/code/li linow go for clean installs, e.g. by following the migration instructions/li /ul  <comment312> That didn't do it, same error as before.
