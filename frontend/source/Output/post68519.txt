Image dimension column in Finder? <body> Is it possible to add a column in the list View in Finder, that displays the dimensions of image files ?   <answer68520> It would appear that the answer is no, not directly.  Options for columns include:  ul liDate modified/li liDate created/li liDate Last Opened/li liDate Added/li liSize (file size, not image size)/li liVersion/li liKind/li liComments/li liLabel/li /ul  and image size is not one of the choices.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kbBD1.png" alt="enter image description here"  You could, however, use a Folder Action to assign image size to the Comments field of a file in a folder and display the Comments column.  Note that in icon view, you can press kbd⌘/kbdkbdJ/kbd and check "show item info" to display image sizes.  <answer68794> Just add the word Pictures (capital P) to the front of your folder name, and you will miraculously get Dimensions and Resolution as a column option.  Then just rename it back.  emNote: You may need to strongright-click on the list view's header bar/strong to see this option, rather than View  Show View Options (code⌘/code codeJ/code)./em  <comment79917> This is perfect because: 1/ This column becomes available in every subdirectories of the root directory.  2/ Clicking the header sorts the file according to the product of width*height. How did you find this ? <comment79919> My mind. It is blown. <comment79921> This is a very interesting solution, seems like a horrible workaround, but a workaround nonetheless. Great answer, Ivan. <comment175497> That is awesome. Except for the way in which it is completely dumb. How would they possibly expect end users to know that? Short of using AskDifferent, of course. <comment237595> I've tried this workaround, and I still just see two dashes. Any ideas?
