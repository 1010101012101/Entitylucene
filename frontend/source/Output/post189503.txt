Prevent Apple Watch face from showing when Do Not Disturb on <body> When Do Not Disturb is on, my Apple Watch still shows the watch face when I turn my wrist. This is a pain at night, because every time I move, I get a bright light shining from the Watch.  When Do Not Disturb is on, I only want the watch to be activated when I press the crown. Is this possible?  <answer189875> In watchOS 3.2, Apple added strongTheater Mode/strong, accessed by swiping up from the Watch Face and tapping the bottom-left icon.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jGDX2.png" alt="Theater Mode"  strongTheater Mode/strong silences the WATCH and prevents the screen from lighting up on wrist-raise or when receiving notifications. Taptic feedback will still be triggered.  You can combine strongTheater Mode/strong and strongDo Not Disturb/strong to silence Taptic feedback, as well. Alarms will still ring as normal.  <comment224757> Simplest answer - don't sleep with your watch on. This has been the general advice since the advent of the clockwork watch. <comment224860> If Do Not Disturb is on, there isn't a reason the watch should be worn to bed as mentioned above by @Tetsujin . <comment224922> I use it as an alarm to wake me up <comment358504> It's also helpful for reading your resting heart rate, or using apps that track your sleep. <comment361025> Just an FYI, the  character doesn't display correctly on any non-Apple device
