restore Macbook 6,1 firmware (Macbook Late 2009) <body> As a genius user :) I have installed MacBook Pro EFI Firmware Update 1.7 which is belong to Macbook Pro 5,5 firmware to my Macbook 6,1 as described in that post: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/195840/221867  After reboot, my Mac is working but all keyboard, bluetooth and USB connections not functioning. So I can't even enter to desktop. After some researched found      One thing to be aware of (as I've unfortunately learnt this the hard way..) is that if you apply the MacBook Pro 2009 firmware (MacBookPro5,5) to your Macbook 6,1, it will work - but it will BREAK macOS Sierra (10.12). One reason to apply this firmware is if you are trying to fix the Sata controller bug (where a SATA3 SSD connected to your Macbook will connect at 1.5 Gbit (instead of 3 Gbit).  Some posts suggest installing the MBP firmware which may fix this issue.  It doesn't, sadly. In any case after you've done this your OS will be borked if you had Sierra installed.      This is because Sierra does NOT support being installed on the 2009   MBP but is supported on the 2009 MB.   It took me a while to work this   out - and the only way to get Sierra installed will be to find a way   to restore the firmware back to MB61.   https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3072620   Luckily I had  an old Yosemite installed HDD replaced with my current Sierra installed SSD and everything is working now and my Hardware seems like:  precodeHardware Overview: /code/pre  Model Name:   MacBook Pro   Model Identifier: MacBookPro5,5   Processor Name:   Intel Core 2 Duo   Processor Speed:  2.26 GHz   Number of Processors: 1   Total Number of Cores:    2   L2 Cache: 3 MB   Memory:   8 GB   Bus Speed:    1.07 GHz   Boot ROM Version: MBP55.00AC.B03   SMC Version (system): 1.51f53   Serial Number (system):   45006CAT8PW   Hardware UUID:    DA906FB2-403D-5CB5-B228-FE7EDE4FE9D2   Sudden Motion Sensor:   State:    Enabled  strongQ: How can I restore back that firmware update and see my mac as MB61.0068.B00 again?/strong  Can we extract that old firmware from another Macbook Late 2009 ? Maybe someone help to give that?  Thanks  <comment339900> You may need a dump of the original firmware from another working model of the same type (MacBook 6,1) as described [here](http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/topic/299811-readsmc-for-efi-a-tool-to-enter-read-smc-keys-from-efi-shell-on-real-macs/page-4)
