Use keyboard for accessing Emacs Menu <body> I am using the   precodebrew install emacs /code/pre  version of gui-based emacs.  After using the mac shortcut to access the Menu bar, I am able to use the mnemonic to access the individual top level menu items: e.g.  precode  ALT-F  for file /code/pre  The problem is that then hitting down arrow key or return does not dropdown the menu items.   Well .. with two exceptions: the    precodeAlt-E (Emacs) and  Alt-H (Help) /code/pre   dropdowns actually work.  The others? Nothing happens. Only by using the Mouse (which is unacceptable to me for common commands in an editor).  Any hints/ideas on this?  <answer177176> I found a good workaround in emacs (beta) forum:  https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/3911/access-menu-bar-using-keyboard-on-mac-os-x  precode(define-key global-map (kbd "C-&lt;f2&gt;")   (lambda ()     (interactive)     (x-popup-menu (list '(0 0) (selected-frame))                   (mouse-menu-bar-map)))) /code/pre  <answer177641> Not sure which Emacs you are using, but if it is GNU Emacs, at least, you should be able to use library strongLa Carte/strong, which gives you complete access to all of the menu-bar menus using the keyboard. You can match the complete path to a menu item deep in a submenu, etc. The source code is here:strongcodelacarte.el/code/strong.
