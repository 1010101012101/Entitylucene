Are there any 1D laser barcode scanners that work well with iOS? <body> I'm looking for a scanner that works similarly to the Microvision ROV which has worked very well for me in the past when connected to a Mac and Delicious Library.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6MmIu.png" alt="microvision r≈çv bluetooth scanner"  Is there anything comparable on the market for iOS bluetooth scanning?  Requirements are to be dedicated external hardware. I prefer battery powered, bluetooth and fast/rugged aspect of a 1D laser powered barcode scanner. Small is nice, but the KoamTac appear to be too fragile so I'd rather something built more like the micro vision or symbol line of USB scanners that are built more like tanks.  I don't need 2D scanning and prefer to not run tethered with a dock to DB9 connector if at all possible. The best list of bluetooth scanners I've seen are on serialio.com's website and the socket mobile line seem to be the most powerful scanners, but I'm hoping someone has actually used this hardware and can speak to the usability of any devices.  <answer49674> The Socket Mobile scanners appear to be the only game in town today.  Their CHS 7Xi and 7XiRx models have gone through the "Made for iPod / iPhone / iPad" certification process and work over bluetooth SPP.  Here's a picture of their "health care" version to show the size.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9gpwJ.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  There appears to be a motorola / symbol device named CS3070 shipping as well, but I haven't seen it used yet.  <comment54962> We were about to test also barcode reading from iphone at the office and looked at cases with integrated readers like this one: http://ipclineapro.com/. It may also be useful to you depending on how you plan to use the reader. Not tested though as we stopped the project.
