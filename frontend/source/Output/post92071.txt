make applescript close keynote after presentation is over <body> does anyone know how i would achieve the following? i want to make applescript close Keynote AFTER the slideshow is finished. any idea? mybe via the class "playing" in keynotes application properties? but i dont know hw to write it. my code so far  precodetell application "Keynote" to open "/Users/bla/Desktop/bla1.key" delay 3 set var to properties of application "Keynote" repeat if var contains "playing:false" then exit repeat end if delay 1 end repeat  do shell script "killall 'Keynote'"  /code/pre  thx   <answer92100> If you run this to kick off the keynote then it will quit Keynote as soon ( well within 5 seconds ) as you stop presenting (esc). If you want it to quit after you sit on the final slide for a preset amount of time then just say so.  precodetell application "Keynote"     if not playing then         start         repeat while playing             delay 5         end repeat     end if     quit end tell /code/pre
