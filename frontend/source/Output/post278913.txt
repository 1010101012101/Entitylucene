Screenshot go 'nowhere' after Dropbox installation <body> I installed dropbox and now my screenshots go to dropbox, I tried disabling "Share screenshots using dropbox" but now screenshots don't go to the folder but also not to the clipboard  How can I store screenshots again?  <answer278918> To check where screenshots are currently assigned, in Terminal type  precodedefaults read com.apple.screencapture location /code/pre  By default that would actually return no answer, as the line should only be written if you ever change it - so I'm assuming Dropbox did change it at some point.  To reset it to the default desktop location, type    precodedefaults write com.apple.screencapture location ~/Desktop /code/pre  followed by    precodekillall SystemUIServer /code/pre  This should cover for kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd Shift ⇧ /kbd kbd 3 /kbd &amp; kbd 4 /kbd screenshots. Screenshots to clipboard should be unaffected, &amp; still be activated by adding kbd Ctrl ⌃ /kbd to either of the above methods.  <comment351028> Please ask only one question per post. You can always ask additional questions in, well, new questions. <comment351029> Are you using the built-in Screenshot options Mac OS provides? <comment351032> Hi, the first command outputted -  "2017-04-07 10:04:42.880 defaults[1193:108936]  The domain/default pair of (com.apple.screencapture, location) does not exist".  In the past Cmd ⌘  Shift ⇧  4 also sent the screenshot to the clipboard for all i recall, i didnt have to use Ctrl ^.. <comment351034> OK, so it didn't have a default set - which ought to mean it should go to desktop. Try setting the location again to make sure. Snap to disk & snap to clipboard have never been the same key command, btw.
