How to get photos back which weren't saved to my iCloud account? <body> I had to repair my phone and forgot to save all of my photos to my iCloud account. Is there any way I can get them back?  <answer184853> If the phone was erased as part of the repair, no, there is no way to get them back.  <comment219245> Never connected to a computer and synched with iPhoto (or some folder on Windows)? Never used Dropbox sync or another cloud solution?
