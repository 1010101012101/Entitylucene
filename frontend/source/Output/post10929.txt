Transferring data from old macbook to new macbook <body> Is there an easy way to transfer my applications and data from my old macbook pro to my new macbook pro?  I vaguely recall a service or utility that transferred "everything" from an old macbook to a new macbook.  <answer10933> You probably mean the emMigration Assistant/em.  <answer10936> I would use a Firewire 800 cable.  Start the old one up in target disk mode (hold T while it boots,) and it mounts as an external drive on the new one.  Drag over stuff that's in your /Applications, etc.  <answer10971> You can use strongTime Machine/strong. Although I prefer having a fresh install. One thing I've found great is strongDropbox/strong. If all your files are also stored here, you can automatically download them once your OS is ready by installing it (Dropbox).
