Macbook Pro 10.7.5 I have internet connection but can't open any page <body> I need some help. My internet was working fine and all of a sudden I am not able to open a web page. I went through some of the steps you recommended to other users, such as adding DNS 208.67.222.222 &amp; 208.67.220.220 to test internet connection but I still can't get a webpage to open up. I ran diagnostics and my internet connection is fine. When I connect the ehternet to the computer it connects fine, but I can't get the wifi to work. Can you help?  <comment86009> when you are connected via wifi can you do the following please: 1) start the program *Terminal* via Spotlight 2) type `ifconfig -a` 3) copy and paste the output to the comments here 4) type `ping -t 3 208.67.222.222` 5) copy and paste the output to the comments here 6) type `ping -t 3 www.google.com` 7)copy and paste the output to the comments here
