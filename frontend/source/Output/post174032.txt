Trying to import SwiftyJSON.framework <body> I am trying to include SwiftyJSON as found here:  https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON#initialization  I installed Carthage with homebrew and setup a Cartfile as described on the Carthage github page under the strongIf you're building for iOS/strong heading.  I have the following directory structure:  precodex/ x/Cartfile x/Cartfile.resolved x/Carthage/Build/iOS/SwiftyJSON.framework x/MyProject/{my Swift code and project} x/MyProject.xcodeproj x/MyProjectTests /code/pre  Here's my project's strongGeneral - Linked Frameworks/strong section:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PyH5N.png" alt="enter image description here"  Here's my project's strongBuild Phases - Run Script/strong section:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gwMJv.png" alt="enter image description here"  If I don't have any code that references codeJSON/code then I'm fine. I can build. I can even get the dummy response from my little server providing some json stubbing.  However, as soon as I add let codejson = JSON(data: swiftObject)/code I'm in trouble.  No matter what I seem to do I get the following:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fYyiN.png" alt="enter image description here"  I emknow/em I must be missing something obvious or completely silly but I'm at my wits end. I haven't been able to find anyone explaining this issue via Google (Or I'm just having a bad day for searching). Can anyone point me toward what I'm probably overlooking or just totally missing?  <answer174054> Looks like you need to import the framework in the swift file where you try to use JSON().  import SwiftyJSON  <comment204920> Welp, I don't know why I thought that was unnecessary. Could swear I read it. Thanks. <comment230369> Welcome @Kevek.
