How can I hide an Application from the Updates Tab in the Mac App Store? <body> I had an app on my MacBook that I never used. I recently did a clean install of Mountain Lion on the same MacBook (not using the Migration Assistant or anything to copy my old data). I reinstalled the apps that I wanted from the App Store (and obviously didn't install the ones I used to have that I no longer wanted).  Now the App Store shows one of my old apps in the updates tab, even though I have never touched that app since my reinstall. There is only one app doing this, there are other apps that I didn't end up installing that I used to have, but they don't appear as updates like this one.  I have tried everything to get rid of the app from the updates. I have even succumbed to the frustration and clicked update, which installed the app, then I deleted it from my computer, and then the app reappeared in the updates immediately.  Any help on how I can get this app to leave me alone forever would be appreciated. Is there a way I can hide an app from the updates tab?  <answer65884> Go to strongPurchases/strong in the strongMac App Store/strong, locate the Application you want to hide, emright-click/em on it and choose emHide Purchase/em.  After a clicking the emHide Purchase/em button in the prompted screen, the item will fade and you no longer will receive update notifications of that Application.   To unhide it just go to strongMac App Store / Store / View My Account/strong, then click on strongView Hidden Purchases/strong from the emAccount Information Page/em, and click the emUnhide/em button.  In both cases you'll need to be logged in.  <comment77552> I already have it hidden, hoping that this would be the case but the update is still visible, even though it is hidden in purchases... <comment87336> In addition to hiding the purchase, you need to remove the application. Drag it from the Applications to the trash.
