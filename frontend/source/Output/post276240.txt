How to delete a specific line of a paragraph in AppleScript? <body> I have a text variable of class codetext/code that shows something like this when it is returned:  precode" This is sentence 1. This is sentence 2. This is sentence 3. This is sentence 4." /code/pre  I want to be able to delete specific lines from the text, without affecting the rest of the variable:  For example: codedelete {1, 3}/code to get this result:  precode"This is sentence 1. This is sentence 3. This is sentence 4." /code/pre  <comment348096> Graham Miln, @patrix, Technically the other question is the duplicate of this question because, 1. This one was asked before the other. 2. rubik's sphere edited the other question to a point that it's become a duplicate of this question. <comment348130> @user3439894 I've merged the two questions now, which combines all existing answers. Feel free to clean up your answer :-)
