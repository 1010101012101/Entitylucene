What's the shortcut for Show/Hide Playlist in VLC? <body> I checked VLC's preferences but it seems that Show/Hide Playlist is the only player's button that doesn't have any keyboard shortcuts in Mac OS X version. Is there any way to control that?  <answer181360> Window Menu  Playlist…br kbd Opt ⌥ /kbd kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd P /kbd   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PqT52.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer269804> kbdControl/kbd+kbdL/kbd &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <comment338993> Are you sure? Ctrl+L does nothing on my MBP (Sierra). I tested with VLC running fullscreen and windowed.
