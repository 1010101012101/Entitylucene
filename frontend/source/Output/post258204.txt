Network users experiencing arbitrary connection loss. Open Directory. LDAP. Mavericks Server <body> I am running a Mavericks server off an 8 core Xeon E5 Mac Pro. The server is serving the Calendar, File Sharing (we have a 3 TB shared drive), Mail, Open Directory, and Messages to 14 Mac Mini clients--all have Network Home Directories.   At random times throughout the day users are complaining about the spinning beach ball of death when using apps, utilizing Spotlight, browsing Finder - basically everything gets broken and the only solution is to disconnect them from file sharing and restart the client.   When I ssh onto the client machine, they're only using 5% of the CPU. The clients are mostly running Mavericks as well.   Can't seem to figure out what's going on, why it only happens to one person at a time, and how to go about troubleshooting. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.
