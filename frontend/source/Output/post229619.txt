Scrolling with two fingers doesn't work at the bottom of the trackpad <body> I have MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015) with OS X El Capitan 10.11.3. If I put my index finger at the bottom of the trackpad and my middle finger closer to the center of the trackpad and try to scroll a page -- it doesn't work -- the mouse pointer just moves. If my index finger is closer to the center of the trackpad -- scrolling works ok.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WyFLQ.jpg" alt="enter image description here" Could this be related to a gesture setting for swiping with two fingers from the bottom side?  How can make it work so I can swipe with fingers even at the bottom edge of the trackpad?
