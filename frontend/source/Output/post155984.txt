Why speed of SSD is increased after enabling FileVault? <body> My config is following:  precodeMac Book Pro Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2014 Processor  2.8 GHz Intel Core i7 Memory  16 GB 1600 MHz DDR3 /code/pre  Apple SSD Controller:  precodeVendor:   Apple Product:    SSD Controller Physical Interconnect:    PCI Link Width: x4 Link Speed:   5.0 GT/s Description:    AHCI Version 1.30 Supported /code/pre  Command for test:  precodetime dd if=/dev/zero bs=1024k of=1G count=1024 /code/pre  Before enabling FileVault strong[1.338061 secs]/strong  precode1024+0 records in 1024+0 records out 1073741824 bytes transferred in 1.338061 secs (802460985 bytes/sec)  real     0m1.342s user     0m0.002s sys     0m0.443s /code/pre  After enabling FileVault strong[1.008163 secs]/strong  precode1024+0 records in 1024+0 records out 1073741824 bytes transferred in 1.008163 secs (1065047865 bytes/sec)  real    0m1.011s user    0m0.002s sys 0m0.341s /code/pre  May some optimization was enabled. Anybody knows?  Similar result was reported by Gabi int this question:  Does FileVault encryption slow read/write access on an SSD?  <answer170950> SSD performance is known to degrade over time, emif no or poor garbage collection is enabled or not working/em. The later can occur if TRIM is inactive, the disk is very full or it has no time to do garbage collection. So if the SSD wants to write data, it will need to delete old data first, slowing down the process.  When encrypting the SSD, all its contents gets re-written and free blocks are liberated. This will result in faster write speeds. Reformatting a disk is an effective way of restoring write speeds.  Just a theory however...
