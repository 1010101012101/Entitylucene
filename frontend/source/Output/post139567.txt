Bulk downloading PDF files in iPad <body> I'd like to know whether there is an app or a service which allows bulk downloading of PDF files from a site page. More generally, is there an app that allows bulk downloading to iPad given a string pattern, like the file name or the file extension?  <answer139569> h1curl/h1  You can use a codecurl/code client for iPhone/iPad to do this (e.g. iCurl or iCurlHTTP). Than you can use this client to download multiple files like this:  precodecurl -L -O http://www.example.com/file[1-5].pdf /code/pre  <comment164636> Thanks! I will try this method (first, I must learn something more about cUrl and the way it works).
