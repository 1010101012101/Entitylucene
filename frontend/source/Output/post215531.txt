How can I completely uninstall DisplayLink? <body> Once upon a time, I installed codeDisplayLink/code but have since uninstalled it. I have another program on my computer that keeps crashing and upon looking at the logs, it seems to be an issue with the codeDisplayLinkManager/code.  precodeNov 12 00:28:31 MoonBook com.apple.xpc.launchd[1] (com.displaylink.displaylinkmanager[24073]): Service exited due to signal: Trace/BPT trap: 5 Nov 12 00:28:31 MoonBook com.apple.xpc.launchd[1] (com.displaylink.displaylinkmanager): Service only ran for 0 seconds.

So how can I completely remove codecom.displaylink.displaylinkmanager/code?  <answer215534> In a Terminal, run codelocate displaylinkmanager/code and you should get a list with all files containing "displaylinkmanager".  Then run coderm file/code, replace file with each file from the previous command. This will delete the files, and hopefully fix the confusion that causes your program to crash.  <answer242286> Just download app again from this link, open the installer file, then select uninstall from there :) http://www.displaylink.com/downloads/osx
