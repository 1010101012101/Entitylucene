Mac OS X UNIX-oriented Tutorial <body> Is there any Mac OS X tutorial/book that covers the UNIX part of this operating system? Topics like:  ul liManaging daemons from the command-line/li liPackage management/li liInstall/Remove dmg's from the command-line/li liEnvironment variables/li liUsers/Groups/Permissions management/li liCLI utilities/li liOS Directory structure/li liLocation of dev headers, libraries, etc/li liDevices names/li /ul  Most of the tutorials I found out there cover GUI applications and that kind of stuff. Is there any material that covers Mac OS X under the hood?  <answer105782> Your question is quite broad. To get the information you seek in different areas and varied levels of detail, you would have to consult:  ul liStart with a strongFreeBSD/strong book or tutorial, plus use the codeman/code command to get information on commands./li listrongApple Pro Training/strong Material, like the ones mentioned at OS X and OS X Server training - this includes paid books/videos published by Peachpit as well as free downloadable guides and white papers by Apple. There is ema lot of material/em available from Apple Pro Training./li liA look at the command line section in the OS X Server: Advanced Administration guide (this may seem a bit shallow if you know Unix and/or have worked with OS X on the command line)./li liSome older (and somewhat outdated) books like emMac OS X Internals: A Systems Approach/em by  Amit Singh, and emMac OS X and iOS Internals: To the Apple's Core/em by Jonathan Levin. These are not for the faint of heart, especially the one by Amit Singh./li /ul  <answer105783> I suggest you to try: Unix for OS X which is a good way to begin with Unix and with the Unix command line interface of Mountain Lion. O'Reilly is a very good editor in the field of the Unixes environments.  <comment124430> This is the guide I'm looking for! Thanks a lot.
