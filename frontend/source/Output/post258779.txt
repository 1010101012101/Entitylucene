Apple iphone 5S <body> I have bought cloud storage TWICE this month and have not used my iphone more than usual- but all the storage I purchased has been used up - 3 days to use 100GB!! Something must be going down that I am not aware of.  I have done a lot of deleting and clearing up of files - but to no avail. Help  <comment323564> Look at the answer on [this question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/123145/88313).  It explains how to manage your iCloud backup and storage. <comment323576> Sure it's the cloud storage that's full, not the phone's memory?
