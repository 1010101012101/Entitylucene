Contacts does not read properly from LDAP and/or Zimbra <body> I can't get Contacts to work with an Open LDAP server in OSX 10.9.2, apparently regardless of the settings that I use.  I can query it from the command line, so it's definitely working.  I have also tried using the Zimbra server (codeCardDAV/code is disabled). Does anyone know a way to get this working, or see a problem in the settings below?  Zimbra of course uses the LDAP server for auth/contacts (apparently via a mirror).  My colleagues using Outlook have no issue getting this to work, but I can't seem to get it to go.  strongLDAP/strong  ol liCommand line works against OpenLDAP w/o auth or emwith/em auth/li liCommand line works against Zimbra server with auth /li liNot many error messages/li liTried all scopes (base,onelevel,subtree)/li liTried many combinations of accounts/li liServer does not use SSL /li /ol  LDAP Server: em(notice the code-D/code difference in the identifier &amp; host address)/em  precode# also works without authentication ldapsearch -vLx -H ldap://ldap.company.com -b "ou=people,dc=company,dc=com"  -D "cn=Andrew Backer,ou=people,dc=company,dc=com" -w secretpassword /code/pre  Zimbra Server:  precodeldapsearch -vLx -H ldap://mail.company.com -b "ou=people,dc=company,dc=com"  -D "uid=andrewbacker,ou=people,dc=company,dc=com" -w secretpassword /code/pre  ul liA filter of code(objectClass=person)/code works to just pull out the people/li liBase and subtree queries work (e.g. without codeou=people/code)/li /ul  I don't get many messages in the log file, most of the time.
