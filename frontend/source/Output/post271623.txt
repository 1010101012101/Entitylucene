Apple Mail keeps asking for google login since Sierra 10.12.4 Beta <body> Apple Mail asks for Google login on a daily basis. This happens to both my personal and work gmail account. I tried generating app specific password but when i go to preferences - account information: there is no field for a password.  This has been happening only since I have upgraded to 10.12.4.  I couldn't reproduce the issue easily - not until the next prompt for password shows.  strongUpdate/strong  I tried deleting and re adding the accounts. It did not fix the issue. Worse, I could not log back into my account this time the google login prompts. It was stuck at a gray screen after entering the password.  emHowever, updating to the latest public beta just now resolved the issue./em  <answer271835> I am not sure what else you've tried so far, so I'll begin from scratch:  strongDisable two-step verification/strong  In the past, I've found that two-step verification caused issues between OS updates. Use Google's website to disable two-step verification for your accounts. You can reenable it later. If you aren't using two-step verification, continue.  strongRe-authenticate/strong  ol liCompletely remove the affected accounts: System Preferences  Internet Accounts  select account  click minus icon/li liAdd the accounts again. You should see a Google-branded login frame in the window./li /ol  If you are able to do this, continue monitoring for the issue. If you've already tried this, please update your answer with what is currently happening and the steps you've taken.  <answer272492> Installing public beta 10.12.4 version v2 resolved the issue.   <comment341463> we do not discuss betas. see the terms of use. <comment341464> @LexS Discussions about public betas are on-topic, see http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2707/what-happened-to-the-beta-ban. The FAQ has been updated to reflect that. <comment341465> Accounts are managed in System Preferences nowadays, not in Mail Preferences. You should be able to change the password there. <comment341505> Same problem here (also started when upgrading to 10.12.4 beta) so I suspect this is a bug. <comment341895> yep same here... waiting for new beta :( <comment342332> Beta 2 seems to have fixed this.
