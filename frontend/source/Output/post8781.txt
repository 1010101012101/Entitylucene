Is there an attribute that can show which process created a file? <body> Now, I can find out which processes are opening files dynamically.  However, for a file on my filesystem, is there a way to find out which process emcreated/em the file?  I'm trying to differentiate a file I created by:  precodetouch(1) /code/pre  from one created by say, an NSAPI process running under my id.  precodelastcomm(1) /code/pre  will give me information such as which tty is doing something, is that an attribute I can access?  Essentially, my id does a bunch of stuff.  Much of what my id does should be via applications, or from a terminal.  I'd like to find out more.  Suggestions?  <answer8800> Darwin is open source. I'm guessing you'll need to modify OS level things, a kernel extension, etc. and add this ability.   Or you could modify the dynamic-view tools you know (codefs_usage/code and/or codelsof/code), have them check if a file is being created, and append the process chain that created it into the Spotlight comment, etc.
