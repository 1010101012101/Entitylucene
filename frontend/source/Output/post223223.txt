After OS X El Capitan, version 10.11.2, my screenshots disappear <body> Right after I upgraded my iMac to OS X El Capitan, version 10.11.2, my screenshots no longer saves to the desktop.  Using "control + shift + 4", my captured shot just disappears, don't know where it goes.   <answer223226> Try running codesudo bash -c "opensnoop | grep Screen"/code in Terminal and take a screenshot. It will show you where it ends up.  What it does: It monitors all file operations and filters for entries with "Screen" in their names.  <answer223227> If the location has been changed, then typing this in Terminalbr codedefaults read com.apple.screencapture location/codebr will show you where it's currently set to.  If you haven't changed it, i.e. it's still set to the default Desktop &amp; has never been redirected, it will error withbr codeThe domain/default pair of (/Users/[user]/Library/Preferences/com.apple.screencapture, location) does not exist/code  If it doesn't exist &amp; still doesn't save to Desktop, then try resetting it to there withbr codedefaults write com.apple.screencapture location ~/Desktop/code  <answer223235> To give a more sophisticated and internationalization safe way of doing it the weird way:  Run this and take one or two screenshots and wait a few seconds. It will output the syscalls done by the screencapture process while renaming the screenshot file. Press kbdctrl/kbd+kbdC/kbd to end it.  precodesudo bash -c "while [ -z \$(pgrep screencapture) ]; do :;  dtruss -n screencapture 2&gt;&amp;1 | grep rename; done" /code/pre  Example output:  precode4737/0xacd92:  rename("/Users/max/Desktop/.Screen Shot 2016-01-12 at 18.49.37.png-vHaw\0", "/Users/max/Desktop/Screen Shot 2016-01-12 at 18.49.37.png\0")        = 0 0 4737/0xacd92:  rename("/Users/max/Desktop/.Screen Shot 2016-01-12 at 18.49.37 (2).png-CYss\0", "/Users/max/Desktop/Screen Shot 2016-01-12 at 18.49.37 (2).png\0")    = 0 0 /code/pre  In the case above, the screenshots got saved to code/Users/max/Desktop//code.  <comment270595> +1: So easy, but somehow way to obvious ;) <comment270596> Default name is ScreenShot, with no space. Would that still work? <comment270597> I tested it on en_US.UTF-8 and the files are called "Screen Shot yyyy-mm-dd at hh.mm.ss.png" <comment270598> @MaxRied - Thank you. I like the obviousâ€¦ it's so much easier for me to understand ;) <comment270601> Interesting, UK default is same [inc the date format] but no space <comment270602> Edited to fit British accent. <comment270604> Nice tweak... ;) <comment270606> The last word should read Desktop, not desktop. <comment270607> Oops, my bad, fixed
