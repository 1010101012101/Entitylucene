Internal SSD: Create a partition in unallocated space <body> I have a MacBookPro 13" Retina late 2013 with an internal SSD, there is 1TB unallocated space, I tried Disk Utility but it doesn't let me create a new partition there (it just does nothing when I click 'Apply').  Verify shows no error, also repair.  precodegpt -r show disk0 start            size   index   contents     0               1           PMBR     1               1           Pri GPT header     2              32           Pri GPT table    34               6    40          409600       1   GPT part - C12A7328-.... 409640     1953083352 1953492992     716800       2   GPT part - DE94.... 1954209792        295 1954210087         32           Sec GPT table 1954210119          1           Sec GPT header   fdisk /dev/disk0 Disk: /dev/disk0   geometry: 121643/255/63 [1954210120 sectors] Signature: 0xAA55          Starting       Ending  #: id  cyl   hd  sec   - cyl   hd sec  [    start -       size]  1: EE 1023  254   63   - 1023 254  63  [        1 - 1954210119] &lt;Unknown ID&gt;  2: 00    0    0    0   -    0   0   0  [        0 -          0] unused   3: 00    0    0    0   -    0   0   0  [        0 -          0] unused   4: 00    0    0    0   -    0   0   0  [        0 -          0] unused   diskutil list /dev/disk0    #:       TYPE NAME                  SIZE      IDENTIFIER    0:   GUID_partition_scheme         *1.0 TB    disk0    1:      EFI EFI                     209.7 MB  disk0s1     2: DE94...                          367.0 MB  disk0s2 /dev/disk1    #:       TYPE NAME                  SIZE      IDENTIFIER    0:  Apple_partition_scheme         *1.3 GB    disk1    1:  Apple_partition_map             30.7 KB   disk1s1    2:      Apple_HFS OS X Base System   1.3 GB   disk1s2 /code/pre  I've booted with CMD-R, can I unmount the disk0? I guess not, but I'm not sure.  I've created an usb stick with OS X 10.9 but the notebook could not boot from this stick.  Is there a way to make a new perdition from the existing free space with diskutil?  <answer114864> If solved the problem by - Boot with ALT CMD P R   After this the former bootcamp partition was again there. - New partitioning of the ssd with only one partition having 1TB - By using Web-recovery installation of Mac OS X - Creating a new bootcamp partition with bootcamp assistent.  My concern was when remove the partition disk0s2 (with recovery OS X) a new installation of Mac OS X is not possible, I wasn't aware of the function Web-recovery.
