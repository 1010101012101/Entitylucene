Symlink TO dropbox folder in different user account <body> Recently purchased a new Mac to be used as a family Mac. We share my Dropbox account and I have installed this into my user folder.   Question: Can I create a symlink into my wife's documents folder TO the Dropbox folder in my account?  <answer92164> If your wife's account has read/write access to your Dropbox folder, then stronga symlink should work/strong. You might need to give special permission to your Dropbox folder to your wife's account, and apply those permissions to enclosed items…                                                 img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nCCsE.png" width="265"  <comment295905> If your wife used Dropbox, then you could create a set of shared folders and keep documents that way. I find that symlinking other users' folders fraught with inconsistency and sometime data loss. Let Dropbox take care of the synch.
