Accessing OS X built in dictionary lookup in Firefox <body> I am really frustrated that Firefox does not provide the three-finger-tap lookup operation is in built in OS X. What is baffling me is that it supports other gestures such as two finger swipes and taps. So why not the 3 finger tap dictionary ?   Is this possible to actually implement ? Or is it because access to in built dictionary and trackpad is blocked by OS ? How can I start looking at this problem ?  <answer129763> Unfortunately looks like this is still an open bug as of today.  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=687026  <answer158896> As of now (Dec 1 2014), although the option is not present in right-click menu, three-finger dictionary lookup works perfectly fine in my Firefox (Developer Edition 35)  Also there have been certain plugins which help you look up words in dictionary through right click. For example https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/look-up-in-dictionary-7261/  <answer229704> Firefox bug #687026 regarding 10.7 - 10.10 was fixed Jan 2016.  Firefox bug #1212527 regarding 10.11 was fixed in May 2016. Firefox 49+ has the fix.  Working as expected on 10.11 and 10.12.  <comment151920> yes I am aware of that. but i was thinking of fixing it and hence want a point to start... <comment235994> Triple-finger lookup works for me (Firefox 39), but there's a subtle bug. I first need to click somewhere on the page. Without this first single click, triple-finger gesture is ignored on newly opened pages.
