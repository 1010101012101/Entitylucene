Chrome running randomly while MacBook Pro is asleep? <body> Over the last couple of days, I've been opening my laptop (from a physically closed, asleep state), to find Chrome running.  It's open, in the foreground, and usually has a little plugin dialogue asking me if I want to keep a chrome extension (asking for permissions).  I don't run Chrome, ever, really, but there it is.  I open the laptop and put in my password, and Chrome has opened while asleep.  The tabs from the last time it was used are all open in the browser.  It's a bit unnerving.  Anyone know how or why this could happen?  Or how I can find out?  hr  EDIT: Here are the specs that were asked for:   1) The Chrome extensions that were running were A) AdBlock (original, not ABP), and B) OneTab.  A was displaying a notification bubble on the first laptop, and B was displaying one on the second time opening the laptop.  I don't remember the exact messages (I think they were related to updating the plugins)  2) Chrome Version â€“ I already deleted the app and emptied the trash, but I believe it was the Friday, August 18, 2017 version, 60.0.3112.107.  3) OSX Sierra Version - 10.12.6 (16G29)  4) Computer - MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2014), 2.5 GHz Intel Core i7, 16 GB 1600 MHz DDR3, Graphics: Intel Iris Pro 1536 MB &amp; NVIDIA GeForce GT 750M 2048 MB.  5) Recent coincidental changes - only ones I can think of are addition of a new Linux operating system to Parallels (stored on a USB3 thumb drive), and addition of the (subscription-based, paid) Disconnect.me VPN (which requires a running app for the VPN to be active).  <comment373567> It may be worth you [editing](https://apple.stackexchange.com/posts/295789/edit) your question to provide additional details such as: (1) What Chrome extension was running (i.e. the one the plugin dialogue was referring to)? (2) The exact version of Chrome you have installed. (3) What version of macOS you're running? (4) The exact model of MBP you have. Finally, it may be worth considering whether this changed behaviour coincides with anything else that's changed (e.g. any recent software updates, new hardware, etc)? <comment373571> Next time you close your laptop, come back 2 minutes later and see if Chrome has opened. It's possible that in some strange way, Chrome is being launched *as* you close it or put it to sleep. Also, if you never use Chrome, you could simply remove it. <comment373596> @monomeeth good point.  I will add this info as soon as I'm near the laptop.
