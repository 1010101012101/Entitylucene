How do I type the Escape key on an iPad keyboard? <body> I just got a Zagg keyboard and it is great for typing long sections of text on the iPad.  But a big drawback is that it does not have an kbdEscape ⎋/kbd key.  All the top row keys are mapped to iPad-specific features. This is bad when using vim or remoting into a Windows machine.  Does anyone know how to get the kbdEscape ⎋/kbd key to work?  Or is there a better iPad keyboard out there that has the kbdEscape ⎋/kbd key?  <answer56884> Give kbdCtrl/kbd and kbd[/kbd a try that should send the same as Esc (ASCII 27).  <answer57057> After much research I cound not find a solution to get the key to work.  My solution was to return the Zagg keybard and simply get a standard wireless keyboard from the Mac store.  It feels solid and works great.  A tad more bulky than the Zagg, but I love that it works with more than just the iPad.  <answer70527> I don't know if the Zagg keyboard has a kbdControl/kbd, but my iPad keyboard has one, and if I do kbdControl/kbd-kbdC/kbd, it forces Vim to quit (at least on my VPS).  <answer75960> For shell-level stuff I use an app called Prompt to SSH into servers and it has ESC and other commonly used VI keyboard sequences.   I am still looking for an escape key for use with the Amazon web services console, when it randomly tosses up a "Please wait..." browser dialog box which it also says to press Esc to end it. No solution yet with either Chrome or Safari that I know of so far. I could use my Mac keyboard, but don't usually have it with me.  <answer84211> Ctrl-[ (Ctrl + left bracket) is identical to Esc.  Am using the Zagg with a Galaxy Tab 10.1 and really love it.  <answer87365> If you have a keyboard with the "keyboard key" the fourth from the left On the top row of keys. This functions like the escape key on other keyboards.  <answer95841> kbdFn/kbd+kbdHome/kbd = kbdEscape ⎋/kbd. Easiest thing ever.  <answer98242> The Zaggkeys keyboard for the iPad mini works well with vim.  On starting the program touch the centre of the screen twice and then press kbdi/kbd for insert mode.  To leave insert mode and enter command mode use the backslash character. This can be obtained by holding the kbdfn/kbd key and pressing the key that has the characters code]\}/code and code|/code on it.  I haven't worked out how you get a code\/code character into your text.  <answer101634> Try fn and the square button (where the Esc key would be)  <answer102143> Take 3 fingers and swipe down on your i-pad screen.  That brings up a menu bar at the bottom of the screen that has an escape button on it.  Touch the escape button on your screen.  <comment65320> Purely out of curiosity, why do you need an escape key, and what does it do on the iPad? I know the eject button raises/lowers the keyboard, and the functions keys manage brightness, media playback, etc., but I've never used Esc apparently. <comment65337> The OP says that its for use when remoting into other systems, and in particular mentions VIM which uses the escape key to switch from editing to command modes. It's understandable that an iPad keyboard does not have the key as it is unlikely to be used, and why many remote access apps include it as an extra on the on screen keyboard (which will be hidden if using a hardware keyboard) <comment81859> Control-C is not Escape <comment96867> Welcome to Ask Different!

I'm not sure that Zagg keyboards for iPads even have FN/Home keys. <comment124396> You must have one of those Samsung i-pads? I am not seeing anything like this. <comment132363> works great for me with a logitech bt keyboard on a 4th gen ipad. Thanks for the tip. <comment139392> I have a zagg keys cover keyboard for ipad mini and this answer works great for me <comment157890> How is this a solution :) <comment221749> This works on a Logitech ultrathin mini keyboard (for iPad mini).  It has a separate backslash key, which functions like Esc in Vim.  (Now I just have to figure out how to type a backslash.) <comment292722> works on Smart Keyboard cover for iPad Pro - thanks! <comment320272> Works on Windows 7 <comment343105> Thanks so much for this. This works great with my Logitech keyboard. I have been looking for this for weeks. It works just like the esc key on the Mac; i.e. It hits the Cancel button. Thanks again! <comment343635> Awesome.  I have a Zagg for my iPad mini and the fn+Home (i.e, square key) did it for me. <comment348546> Doesnt work on OSX :(
