QuickTime Screen + Audio Capture <body> I'm using Retina Macbook Pro running OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion. Is it possible to use QuickTime to capture both audio and screen ? If not, what are the free apps that can do it?  P.S. A lot of the times I see on Youtube that it possible to capture screen + audio + have a little window of yourself in the corner - how is that achived?  <answer60088> Theres a few youtube videos that show you how to do this (as best it can) with quick time, heres a good one.  Quicktime is far from the best screen recording software though, and it won't give you the picture in picture you're looking for. I don't know of any free software that will but screenflow is one of the most popular paid apps and it's under a hundred bucks so if you want really nice screencasts, take a look at it.  <answer66836> This is a Youtube video I produced on how to do it entirely for free: record CPU audio as well as Mic Audio while doing a screen capture.  You'd think that it would be a standard feature...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lB9Ovqk5H5c  It should work just fine!  Good Luck  <answer242446> This is how I did it. You may need a pair of headphones if you use the bult-in microphone.  Open quicktime and click File-New Screen Recording br Select the audio source by clicking on the small down-pointing arrow br Turn up the sound that appears below the record button br Click File-New Movie Recoring br Resize the movie window and place it where you like it BR Click record on the screen recorder window   <answer261630> Soundflower is the free tool for you. Take a look at this video and How to record both screen and sound with Quicktime on El Capitan?  <answer261637> To answer your P.S.: Picture-in-picture videos are done with third-party software. A free option for this on Mac is OBS, which is primarily intended for live streaming to gaming sites, but does allow offline recording too. In my experience, it can be a little tricky to set up.   Reputable paid options include Screenflow and Camtasia, which are far more polished but can only be used for offline recording.  <answer291090> just For the help of others having below OS version  Mac OS 10.12.5 Sierra  MacBook Air (13-inch, Early 2015)  Click on Quicktime - Start new screen recording - recording screen opens -Click on down arrow in right side of red button ,Make sure to click it ,you will get option for internal (built in microphone) selection ,select it and you are done .  <comment69231> rMBP = Retina Mac Book Pro.

It may get removed in the future leading to a broken link here. <comment313122> This solution does not capture audio.  Quicktime cannot capture audio when you are doing a screen capture. <comment313123> Your link to youtube is broken. <comment313124> Sound flower is no long maintained.
