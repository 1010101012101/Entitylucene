iPhone 6 shows charging icon but not charging <body> Recently my iPhone stopped charging at all. I took it to a local mobile shop in Pakistan; they changed my charger and it started charging, then all of a sudden it stopped. It shows the charging icon but the battery percentage was not increasing, rather decreasing.  They told me to change the port, so I did and now it is charging from only one side of the USB cable. I have tried different other cables as well and different other chargers too.  <answer291145> Maybe, the problem is that there is dirt/dust inside the connector (lightning) port.  Try cleaning with a toothpick (plastic is the best) to remove possible dirt from the port.  <comment367581> removed dust..even got it changed..now its giving this proble.
