Smart folder: How to exclude all files and directories inside a folder with specific name <body> I create a Smart folder to show all the files created today, but I want to exclude all the files inside any folders with a specific name.  Example:  precode- foobar - - subfolder - - - file1.doc - - - file2.mp3 - - file3.doc - - file4.mp3 /code/pre  strongI want to exclude all the files and directories inside any folders named  codefoobar/code/strong.   Notice: also the files in the subfolders (codefoobar/subfolder/*/code)  I'm on macOS Sierra 10.12.2  How can do it?  <comment338711> Do you use macOS Sierra or Mac OS X El Capitan? You've added "Sierra" as a tag but I think you should specify the OS version in your question. <comment338712> macOS Sierra 10.12.2.
