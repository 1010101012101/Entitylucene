Message send failure on iOS 7 <body> I recently bought a iPod touch 5supth/sup generation and installed iOS 7. Whenever I try to send messages, I get a message failure notice. I checked Settings, Contacts, changed the DNS to 8.8.8.8 but nothing seems to fix the problem. Can you help?  <answer105402> Try resetting your network settings - this fixes a variety of problems with Messages in iOS7. You shouldn't need to change your DNS, especially if you can browse the web normally with your existing DNS settings.  <comment123887> Are you looking for the http://support.apple.com/kb/TS2755 so you can rule out some of the causes of this type of failure? <comment179336> One thing you certainly should do is install iOS 8. Retry after that :) <comment352448> Or iOS 9? You can't get 8 anymore.
