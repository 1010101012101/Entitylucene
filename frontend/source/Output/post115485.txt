Pages '09 flags file as modified after printing <body> I'm using codePages '09/code with Mountain Lion (10.8.3).  Every time I open a file to just print it and don't make any modifications, Pages '09 flags it as modified.  If I just want to close kbd⌘/kbd+kbdW/kbd this file, and to be sure I didn't make any unwanted modifications, I get this window:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BbJi8.png" alt="test Pages warning window".  ul liThe first choice makes me think I made an unwanted modification./li liThe third one is inappropriate if I didn't made modifications./li liThe second choice bring me back to the same state: document to close and next the same warning window./li /ul  Is there an easy way to suppress this irrelevant warning window in such a case, i.e. when I didn't made any modification and such a warning window is neither necessary nor usefull.  Is this bug fixed in any recent version of codePages/code?  <answer115490> Since the file emis/em being modified, there's no way to suppress this.  You can notify Apple that you would like this feature implemented using their Pages feedback page:  ul lihttp://www.apple.com/feedback/pages.html/li /ul  <comment135143> → grgarside: thank you for your attempt to help. The bug is reported to Apple since more than 2 years. I'm here talking of a situation where `I` clearly `didn't` made any modification to my file. I'm not talking of modifications made either by the software or the system which I don't care of, and moreover I don't want to be bothered with. Otherwise, you easily imagine that any simply opened file should be flagged as modified (think of access time ☺).
