How do I hide the "open window icons" in the dock in OSX 10.10? <body> I recently got my very first MacBook Pro. It has OSX 10.10 Yosemite on it.

Note that I do not mean the application icons themselves (see screenshot for clarification).   How can I disable these "open window" icons so that only application icons show up?
