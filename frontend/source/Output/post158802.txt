Completely new Time Machine backup? <body> I made use of Time Machine to restore my Mac's OS and data to a new drive after the old one failed. Time Machine doesn't seem to recognize that the new drive and the back ups are related. Is there a method to connect the two, or do I need to wipe that drive containing the old history, and just start a new TM backup?   <answer158804> The Time Machine backups became disassociated with the new drive because of the change to the UUID of the new drive. With a little usage of codetmutil/code in Terminal following the directions here, you can rebuild the association of the Time Machine backups to the new drive.  <comment186706> I appreciate the response. That terminal command isn't available in 10.6.8. Strange enough. <comment186723> Ahh, yes, pre-Lion there is no `tmutil`. You may have to do some Googling to find the answer on how to achieve this, which the author of the linked article describes as "very techie".
