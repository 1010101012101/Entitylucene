Safari redirect to App not working <body> I have an app on my iPhone , that i am trying to open . Lynda.com.  I Tap the Lynda.com app on your device to launch it. Ignore the user name and password fields on the login screen and instead tap on the button labeled web portal log in On the web portal access screen, enter &lt; company name in the URL box. I am  directed to Usher ( my company's internal authentication )  After successful authentication , i had to be redirected back to Lynda.com App ..  This works on several of my coworkers phone , but on my phone after the authentication is successful I am still on Lynda.com safari browser .  Things i tried : -Updating my IOS on phone to the same version that a current working phone is on ( latest update 9.3.3) -deleting safari cache  -deleted and reinstalled Lynda.com app and retried ..  Nothing is working , i want to be able to open the app as an app noy through safari , any suggestion please !!!  Thanks in advance   -- Indu  <answer248061> It is iPhone 6.  I have found the solution . It was the because the private mode was turned on on my safari browser , When turn it off , the browser redirect works and opens the page in app . when turned on , there is no pop for :open in app ' and i am still in web page.  <comment305369> This seems like you need programming advice, maybe turn to stackoverflow.com <comment305545> What phone do you have, and what do they have?
