iMessage conversations on iPad 2 are not appearing on my iPhone 5 <body> I've just bought myself an iPhone 5, I've set up iCloud on it and synced it with my iPad. However, all of the iMessage conversations I had on my iPad are not showing up on my iPhone's iMessages. How can I load and continue to have my old iMessage conversations from my iPad to my iphone?  <answer209124> They are not stored in iCloud (or the iMessage server). This is for your own privacy.  They cannot be redownloaded.
