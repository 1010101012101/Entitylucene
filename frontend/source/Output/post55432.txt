Keyboard shortcut for restoring applications from the Mac OS X Dock? <body> Is there a keyboard shortcut to restore a minimised application window from the Dock?  Almost all Apple Mac OSX applications respond to the kbdApple/kbd + kbdM/kbd command which minimises the current application window to the Dock, which is fine.  I can then use kbdCommand/kbd + kbdTab/kbd to cycle through my running applications - including the minimised application, but selecting the application with the minimised window neither restores the minimised window, nor sets focus to the minimised application window in the Dock so I can restore it without having to reach for the Mouse..  strongUpdate:/strong Thanks for the answers, however the consensus seems to be to use the 'Hide' feature (kbdApple/kbd + kbdH/kbd) instead of minimising, as it's easier to get the window back using kbdCommand/kbd + kbdTab/kbd.  <answer55433> I don't know of a direct way to restore a minimized window, however, you can get keyboard focus in the dock by pressing kbdfn/kbd+kbdcontrol/kbd+kbdF3/kbd. Then select the item you want via the arrow keys and press kbdspace/kbd or kbdreturn/kbd to restore it.  <answer55434> Depending on how your keyboard is set in system preferences, the shortcut to focus the dock may be kbdCtrl/kbd + kbdFn/kbd + kbdF3/kbd.  <answer55435> I asked for assistance at the Apple Genius bar in Aventura, and while they didn't have an answer, they did suggest using the Hide feature instead (kbdApple/kbd + kbdH/kbd) which works well because when I kbdAlt/kbd + kbdTab/kbd back to the application the hidden window is shown.  <answer55436> You can launch the application again to display the last minimised windows. For example, if you minimise Safari, clicking the Safari icon in the dock or launching it via Spotlight will un-minimise the last minimised window.  I've only checked this with the 5 apps I have open but it works in each of them.  I guess you could write an applescript to perform this function and assign it to an keyboard shortcut.  <answer55437> I would strongly suggest using Witch. This lets you bring back minimized apps, as well as 'orphaned' apps, after you have closed the main window. You can also directly access the different windows within an app. Well worth the registration fee; about 10 euros.   <answer55439> I had to find this one, as I use Linux as well as Mac OS X, and in Thunderbird kbdCtrl/kbd + kbdM/kbd is the key to compose a new message... under Linux. On Mac OS X, it keeps "minimizing" the app. This is a little tricky, but...  kbdCmd/kbd + kbdTab/kbd to the app you want to restore. Release kbdTab/kbd, but keep kbdCmd/kbd held down. Now press kbdOption/kbd (a.k.a. kbdAlt/kbd), and while it is held down release kbdCmd/kbd.  I have been "training" myself to make use of kbdCmd/kbd + kbdH/kbd (Hide) on Mac OS instead of minimizing. If you hide an app, then once it is selected via kbdCmd/kbd + kbdTab/kbd it pops back up on-screen.  <answer55440> ol likbdCommand/kbd + kbdTab/kbd until you get the app's icon. /li listrongBefore releasing/strong kbdCommand/kbd, press and hold kbdstrong⌥/strong/kbd (option)./li /ol  <answer55441> A couple of caveats about the alt/option option:   1) You must switch to another app and let it take focus first.  In other words, you can't just (shift-/)command-tab to another app and before actually selecting that app (by releasing command-tab), switch right back to your minimized app which you might do if you minimized by accident or just simply changed your mind shortly after minimizing.  2) Both the command and left alt/option keys must be pressed on the same side of the keyboard.  <answer64687> To restore one of many minimized windows using only the keyboard, you have two choices:  While using kbdCmd/kbd + kbdtab/kbd (eg. changing applications):  ol liStart with a minimized window/li likbdCmd/kbd + kbdtab/kbd to the application icon (Continue to hold kbdCmd/kbd)/li liWhile holding kbdCmd/kbd, push the kbd&uarr;/kbd (or kbd&darr;/kbd) arrow key on the keyboard. This will bring up a list of all the application's windows (You can release key command key once the window list view comes up if you like)/li liPush the down arrow key (kbd&darr;/kbd) to select the minimized windows./li liUse the left and right arrow keys (kbd&larr;/kbd or kbd&rarr;/kbd) to select the minimized window you want/li liPush kbdReturn/kbd or kbdEnter/kbd to restore the window and bring it into focus (make it the selected window)/li /ol  (Tested on OSX Mountain Lion)  Or,  Directly when the application is already the current application:  Steps as above, but instead of steps 2 and 3 (kbdCmd/kbd + kbdtab/kbd and arrow keys):  ol liStart with a minimized window/li likbdControl/kbd + kbd&darr;/kbd/li /ol  OSX Mountain Lion "Keyboard" preferences have a "Mission Control" keyboard shortcut for this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Hbs0G.png" alt="OS10.8 Preferences: Keyboard/Keyboard Shortcuts/Mission Control"  <answer82186> I have found the answers to this question helpful for this as well.  For an easy way to invoke App Expose to get at minimized windows for current app use kbdCmd-Down; Down; Enter/kbd.  <answer86527> Cmd + Tab and focus on desired application and then press Cmd + L. (Works with Mountain Lion)  <answer111214> Some applications have their own shortcuts:  ul liiTunes: kbd⌘ Cmd/kbd+kbd⌥ Opt/kbd+kbd1/kbd/li liMessages: kbd⌘ Cmd/kbd+kbd0/kbd (for the Messages window); kbd⌘ Cmd/kbd+kbd1/kbd (for Buddies list)/li liCalendar: kbd⌘ Cmd/kbd+kbd0/kbd/li /ul  <answer230080> Command + L to restore minimize application :)  <answer244657> I use OS X El Capitan  kbdCmd/kbd kbdM/kbd is minimize and then press kbdCmd/kbd kbdL/kbd works  <comment63629> I think this is a better way of doing things. Just hide the apps that you are not using at the moment.  I do not know if there is a difference in resource usage between Hiding and Minimizing and app. <comment63630> Voted-up.... once I learned about Hide I stopped bothered with minimise. <comment63631> I prefer this method over the above one. Hold Alt after Cmd + Tab is not so convinient <comment63632> Thanks for the tip, I'll check it out :o) <comment63633> Thanks! This does indeed answer my question.  (hint - the 'option' key is also labelled 'alt' on the new mac keyboards) <comment63634> Is this only supposed to work when there all widows are minimized? It seems to only restore one window of many. <comment63635> This method is the equivalent of clicking the application's icon in the dock, so it behaves exactly the same way. <comment63636> Exactly what I wanted -- thanks! <comment63637> life savior ! been searching for this for a while <comment63638> rjray's answer explains this better. Once you've command-tabbed to the correct app, keep holding command, but release tab, then press option, release tab, then finally release option. Aargh! http://stackoverflow.com/a/67911/177018 <comment63639> Apple should make it like --- Command + Shift + M <comment63655> There's something easier I use to do: instead of cmd + M (minimize) apps, etc, I use to cmd + H (hide). When I alt + tab (alternate apps, etc) it restores immediately. Btw, here goes two nice references for Mac shortcuts: http://www.danrodney.com/mac/ http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1343?viewlocale=en_US <comment76556> That's really nice! <comment76963> nice Applescript:  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7681418/un-minimizing-an-app-with-applescript <comment91468> -1: should be a comment <comment99991> How do you focus on the application using the keyboard? <comment99992> +1 for a good suggestion which happens to be a paid app (also look at Optimal Layout which is in the App Store) <comment100642> This answers the question. But the hide function requires fewer keystrokes and is therefore preferable. <comment101917> Unfortunately, Cmd + L conflicts with the command to focus on the omnibar in Chrome and search bar in other applications. <comment115505> This is the best option if you have multiple windows open and need to choose which one to restore. <comment115506> This is the best option for everyday use but it only restores one window of many. If you have more than one active window @Steve S's solution below is best. <comment130895> If you could expand your list that would be great. <comment131727> This is the answer, not: "use Hide". I know all about "hiding" and use it often. Minimizing/restoring minimized windows is useful when you have many browser windows (one with email, for example). I don't want to "hide" the entire browser; I want to minimize only the email window, and occasionally restore it [quickly with a keyboard shortcut]. <comment132266> Alas, these are the only ones I've found so far.  The "problem" with web browsers (the other commonly used app for which I wish there were a simple shortcut) is that you can have multiple windows, which means the app wouldn't know which to pull up in the case of multiple minimized windows.  I suppose the same principle holds for apps like those in MS Office. <comment159512> Doesn't work in Mavericks <comment185161> A critical difference b/w Hiding and Minimizing occurs in certain special usage patterns, for example if you've enabled iTerm's drop down terminal, then hitting your drop down terminal HotKey will do different things depending on whether the app was originally minimized or Hidden. If it was Hidden, it'll show/switch to your last visible iTerm terminal and also drop down the terminal, on the other hand if it was minimized, you'l still be able to see your current window behind the drop down. (Hopefully I was able to make *some* sense). <comment192753> Works on Yosemite, brings Chrome too. Chrome's shortcut Cmd+L is not active when minimized so they don't interfere. <comment205131> Works on Yosemite too. Thanks for a great answer. <comment214090> +1 for adding the Update about using the 'Hide' feature <comment263189> I just tried this on Yosemite, and it didn't work for me or on my workmates computer. Or am I just super unco-ordinated. <comment289565> Step #4 ("Push the down arrow key (↓) to select the minimized windows.") isn't necessary on 10.11, it seems. The focus starts out in the row of minimized windows and old documents, even though there is no visible highlight; once you press left or right arrow the first one is highlighted and focused. <comment294761> @AshCooman If the application window is in full-screen mode, you need to exit that mode first.  Hit Esc  (wait a moment)   Cmd-H <comment301523> Yeah CMD + L doesn't really seem to work. <comment363084> @AshCooman This also does not work for me on macOS 10.12.5. It brings up the menu bar of the selected app, but not the window of the app.
