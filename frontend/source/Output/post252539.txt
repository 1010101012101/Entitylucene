How to create USB Install media from Windows and install OSX on Mid-2007 Mac Mini <body> I recently acquired a mid-2007 Mac Mini from a friend of mine. It had a corrupted hard drive and a dubiously functioning CD drive. I replaced the hard drive, and now need to load an OS. Also, I don't have any apple peripherals: my Logitech mouse and Dell keyboard seem to work ok, and I've mostly worked out how the boot-command mappings work for the keyboard.  I have a (somewhat scratched) white replacement Tiger disk, an .iso of Snow Leopard, and a .dmg of Lion. I would be delighted if ANY of these could be loaded.   I first tried following this guide: http://pureinfotech.com/make-bootable-usb-mac-os-x-windows/ to create a bootable USB drive.  When I turn it on, the screen simply flashes the '?' folder symbol initially. If I try to boot into 'startup options' (I hold down left alt, should equate to 'option' key), the mouse pointer appears, but there are no options available. This is true if I have the Lion USB plugged in OR with the disk in the drive.   I need to get this machine running-- any suggestions would be more than welcome!   <comment314248> The latest released Apple OS that runs on that Mac mini is Mac OS X 10.7.5, which itself is no longer supported and has exploitable security issues, as well as probably doesn't support a Browser that will work properly with SSL versions needed by todays standards and therefore no secure online connections. I'd probably put Linux on it, as at least it can be kept updated and secure in comparison. <comment314282> What other Macs do you have available? What operating systems are they running? <comment314593> I don't have any other Mac systems-- I'm primarily a Windows user. I have a couple of Linux boxes running Debian. <comment314594> Honestly, even I'd be thrilled if I could get it to install Ubuntu or Debian at this point, but I can't get it to boot from USB at all
