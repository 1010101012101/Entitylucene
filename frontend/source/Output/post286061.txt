Mail accounts dissapeared <body> Last night I switched Mac Pro Sierra 10.15.5 to different user and later just closed laptop. Battery was like 90%. Today I switched to usual user and found Mail with no accounts. Just a screen with welcome screen (with text - Choose a Mail account Provider...).   My Mail/V2/MailData is empty.   However I am also not able to add an account! If I fill in all info (like account email, name, password etc.) I get a window to choose what apps it will be using, so I choose only Mail, push next or done and it doesn't do anything - the done button from blue becomes grey and nothing else happens.  EDIT:  I switched Mac user to different again, closed all programs then switched to usual user and Mail appeared with all accounts. However I had to enter passwords of each of them... And some are not working - password or name does not match error...  I wonder why this behaviour happened..
