Google calendar not syncing right color on iPad <body> I set up my iPad syncing with Google calendar using CalDav. The color should be synced as well. iOS has a way of distorting the colors somewhat, but they should (more or less) be the same.   Strange thing is, in Google calendar (web) I assigned blue to my default calendar. On my iPad, this is turned into bright green??? Secondary calendars do match, but my default calendar shows up on my iPad in a totally different color. How do I fix this? Can this have something to do with 2-factor authentication and the fact that I use an app password for the calendar app on my iPad?  ul liI have tried to delete the account from my iPad and setting it up all over again to no effect./li liI have tried to assign a different color on the web and refresh the calendar list in the calendar app on iPad. Still no change./li /ul  Does anybody have any idea how I go from here?  <comment175412> It almost certainly has nothing to do with 2-factor authentication. Since your question is about the iPad app, it might be better off at [apple.se]. <comment175413> This question appears to be off-topic because it is about a Mac OS app
