MacBook display screen <body> Is it possible to fix a MacBook Pro display glass for a cracked one of a MacBook unibody? Since they have the same dimensions.  <answer243089> Per the fixit-store: There is only one LCD glass panel for each model in a similar era (providing the "screen size" spec matches).  So, yes, as long as they are of a similar year!  <comment299239> Please could you add a link to the FixIt store page mentioning this.
