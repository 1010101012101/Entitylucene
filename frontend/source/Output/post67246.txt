Why does iPhone Safari not save login credentials for a certain Wi-Fi hotspot? <body> My Academy's wi-fi requires me to log in via a web-browser portal page before I have access to the internet. Safari on my iPhone doesn't save my username and password for it. Is there a way to manually force it to save them?  <answer69389> Do you really need to log in using Safari?  Otherwise you go to 'System Preferences'  'Wi-Fi'  Select the appropriate network  Log in  Deselect 'Ask To Join Networks' This way, your iPhone remembers this Wi-Fi network and your iPhone will automatically connect to this network when you're within the range of the academy Wi-Fi.  <answer69407> If this is a "captive portal" - a wifi network where you need to input your password into a form on a web page, or check a box agreeing to terms of use, then in my experience the iPhone will not remember the password.  <answer69418> It's not a matter of Safari not remembering the password, its a matter of the network requiring login based on the browser.  Most captive walled gardens require it with every disconnect for security purposes.    <answer83105> check out this link http://www.ausbt.com.au/how-to-save-passwords-in-safari-on-the-ipad-iphone to setup autofill name and passwords for safari on IOS.  And it totally is a matter of safari not remembering username/password.  It's a little hidden, but it's there, and thanks for asking a good question. The other answerers here must never have logged into a captive portal before or something.  <answer167346> I had this problem. Turns out I was in Private Browsing mode.  <comment107869> This answer is incorrect. The academy requires him to log in via a log-in page on the web browser like most other public hotspots. <comment269121> This does not work as on the page I am using the user is never prompted to 'save password' so nothing is stored
