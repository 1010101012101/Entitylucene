How can I check my line-in does work (MBP late 2010)? <body> How can I check my line-in does work?   I'm interesting what software should I use and how.  It is MBP, late 2010. I do have an external working mic.  <answer11065> ol liLaunch System Preferencesâ€¦ from the Apple menu./li liClick on Speech./li liThe left tab is marked Speech Recognition./li liSet the Microphone from the default "Internal microphone" to "Line In"./li liClick on the Calibrate button. Then speak the phrases on the left e.g. "What Time Is It?"/li /ol  If your Mac detects your line-in, you'll see the blue-green-red indicator respond to the volume of your voice from the line-in.  Have fun, and don't forget to mark the question as answered when you're done. Cheers.  <answer11066> You could try using LineIn.app from rogueamoeba. It allows to pass-through audio from line-in to speakers (normally disabled in Mac OS X). I did use this app quite a few times to play music from external source. Should do the trick for you.  <comment11565> it is the funniest in-built utilite ever :) thanks! <comment11566> LOL, true, and it wasn't even intended originally to detect line-in versus internal microphone.  I'm just glad it's available for free as part of the OS X.
