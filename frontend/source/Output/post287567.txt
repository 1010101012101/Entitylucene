Spotlight and Dock going light-gray despite being set to dark <body> I have a MBP 13" (late-13) with macOS Sierra 10.12.2.  I have this problem recently (not linked to the update): under codeGeneral/code in codeSystem Preference/code I'm always setting my menu bar and dock (and implicitly, spotlight) to dark:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/m1j1z.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Sometimes, randomly, suddenly, dock and spotlight em(but not the menu bar)/em go light-gray (what happens when the menu bar isn't set to dark) like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xKSxk.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  And when I check codeSystem Preference &gt; General/code I find "Use dark menu bar and Dock" strongchecked/strong. The problem goes away simply by unchecking and then checking it again. It's pretty annoying though, and I want to solve it.
