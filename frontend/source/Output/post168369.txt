iPhone 5 sending messages through email <body> My text messages are sending through email and when I talked to others and looked it up I had to just select my phone number instead of the email address under send/receive in messages; however, my phone number is not listed. I am not sure how to proceed.  <comment197635> 1. Does it *always* send as email, or only to some people? 2. When you go into Settings, what settings are set under the section for "Messages"?
