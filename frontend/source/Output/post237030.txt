How to get the geolocation of an IP address in Terminal? <body> Is it possible to get the geolocation of an IP address in Terminal?  Not sure what the numbers in an IP address mean, but there must be some logic behind it, so lookup can't be that hard.  <answer237033> You can do this without having to install any additional apps or software.  Just use the command codecurl/code and the free geo ip website http://freegeoip.net.  Execute the following command in Terminal (I am using Apple's IP for this example):  codecurl freegeoip.net/xml/17.178.96.59/code  You will get your results in an XML format:  precode&lt;Response&gt;     &lt;IP&gt;17.178.96.59&lt;/IP&gt;     &lt;CountryCode&gt;US&lt;/CountryCode&gt;     &lt;CountryName&gt;United States&lt;/CountryName&gt;     &lt;RegionCode&gt;CA&lt;/RegionCode&gt;     &lt;RegionName&gt;California&lt;/RegionName&gt;     &lt;City&gt;Cupertino&lt;/City&gt;     &lt;ZipCode&gt;95014&lt;/ZipCode&gt;     &lt;TimeZone&gt;America/Los_Angeles&lt;/TimeZone&gt;     &lt;Latitude&gt;37.3042&lt;/Latitude&gt;     &lt;Longitude&gt;-122.0946&lt;/Longitude&gt;     &lt;MetroCode&gt;807&lt;/MetroCode&gt; &lt;/Response&gt; /code/pre  You can even issue the same command using the domain name instead of the IP:  codecurl freegeoip.net/xml/apple.com/code  strongOther Formats.../strong  freegeoip.net also supports CSV, and JSON  CSV: codecurl freegeoip.net/csv/apple.com/code   precode17.178.96.59,US,United States,CA,California,Cupertino,95014,America/Los_Angeles,37.30,-122.09,807 /code/pre  JSON:  codecurl freegeoip.net/json/apple.com/code  precode{"ip":"17.178.96.59","country_code":"US","country_name":"United States","region_code":"CA","region_name":"California","city":"Cupertino","zip_code":"95014","time_zone":"America/Los_Angeles","latitude":37.3042,"longitude":-122.0946,"metro_code":807} /code/pre  <comment290182> You want a geolocation of an Ip? https://www.iplocation.net/ <comment290186> Maybe with http://macappstore.org/geoip/ <comment290187> Or read this article: http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20100109053441706 <comment290207> NOTE: linking an IP address to a geographical location is not a hard science. While most addresses will be reliable, there are millions of addresses that, when looked up, will resolve to a general location, like the center of a city, or even the middle of the country. There is an interesting article about how an random farm in the middle of Kansas has been the target of abuse and criminal investigations because a major geolocation service placed their "general location for the USA" flag on their farm. http://fusion.net/story/287592/internet-mapping-glitch-kansas-farm/ is a link to the article. <comment291390> Also in regard to your latter assertion, no there is no enforced correlation between public IP address values and geography. Companies and organisations lease blocks of IPs; they can do with them whatever they wish.
