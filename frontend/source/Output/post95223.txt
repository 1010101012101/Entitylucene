How to speed up reading Blu-ray images? <body> I have unencrypted .iso images of both DVD and BD (don't know how to check the UDF version used). When mounting and copying files off them, BD is around four times slower. Why? How do I speed it up?  <answer178340> The easiest solution to reach Blu-ray or DVD ISO on Mac is to digitize ISO image to readable file type for iMac, this is my suggestion.
