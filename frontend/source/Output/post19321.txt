Email stuck in outbox but can't access it <body> I have Office 2011 installed on Mac OS 10.6 and I tried to send an email to multiple recipients and got this error: codeThe message could not be sent because it has unresolved recipients/code. And now, every time it does Send/Receive I get this error: codeA message could not be sent/code  The problem is that the message got stuck in Outbox but I can't access it, can't delete it, nothing. Any idea how I could get rid of it?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dLGB3.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer19329> Solved it by deleting the account (it was an IMAP account) and exporting the emails (codeFile -&gt; Export -&gt; .olm/code) and adding back the account.  <answer33598> Open the strongAppleScript Editor/strong found in /Applications/Utilities.  Paste in the following three lines:  precodetell application "Microsoft Outlook"   delete every message of outbox end tell /code/pre  Click the strongRun/strong button at the top and this should delete every message in your Outbox.
