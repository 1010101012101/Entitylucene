Latex formatting on iMessage? <body> I was wondering,  is it possible to allow for simple latex formatting on iMessage? At least for just greek letters, it shouldn't be too different from the emoticons support.  <answer171138> The Emoticons you are talking about are Emojis.   The emojis are part of the Unicode set. Apple provides a keyboard for this set of unicode characters.   What you need is a keyboard that provides the unicode characters you want. Maybe just adding a greek keyboard in the system settings could solve your problem.    <answer171144> A dirty solution: use LaTeXiT (http://pierre.chachatelier.fr/latexit/latexit-home.php?lang=en), simply type whatever you need to write into iMessage there, then copy the result as an image and paste it into iMessage.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/p7PHv.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer171202> It is actually possible to send arbitrarily complex LaTeX formulae with the help of LaTeXiT. The trick is fairly simple:  ol liEnter the LaTeXiT preferences and, in the first tab, set the export format as codePNG/code. I also suggest to set the Scale to 250%, but this is a matter of taste./li liType a LaTeX formula in iMessage (not need to put the dollars)/li liHighlight the text, go to the codeiMessage -&gt; Services/code menu and choose any of the LaTeXiT services (for instance, the "Display" one)/li listrongTa-dah!/strong After few seconds, your Tex code will be converted into a PNG image, ready to be sent through iMessage!/li /ol  PS: In case you don't see the service in the menu, go to your system preference and activate it:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jDnVY.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment201335> It is very different from emoticon support. Emoticons are just letters (as greek letters). LaTeX needs an piece of code interpreting it and rendering the output. <comment201338> Of course, I see what you mean. This is why I was asking for SIMPLE latex support, meaning just single symbols. <comment201390> Dirty but rather useful! <comment201396> There should actually be a "service" (Appname Menu-Services-...) which *should* let you TeXify anything that you write, but I never figured out how this works, if you ever manage, let me know ;-) http://cl.ly/image/462t16273Y1r/Image%202015-02-09%20at%207.01.06%20PM.png <comment201402> Actually I did! I will now post what I found :-) <comment201405> Cool! It would now be interesting to find a way to automatically convert to an image any time you write something enclosed in two dollar signs, although another (dirty) way is simply to call one of those services through a keyboard shortcut and/or a BetterTouchTool gesture
