How to change keyboard layout of macbook pro during first run registration? <body> I'm running the registration after turning on my new macbook pro for the first time. I've chosen my national keyboard layout and now I can't write @ or + signs. I don't know how to change keyboard layout, some shortcuts like cmd space or cmd alt space don't work. Please notice that I also need to write national characters, so going back and choosing english keyboard layout won't work.  <answer48588> Assuming you use the czech keyboard:  strongnormal/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TDAhM.png" alt="enter image description here"  with strongshift key/strong pressed  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/q4qt4.png" alt="**enter image description here**"  with strongoption key/strong pressed  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hD2lN.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment55646> To which locale did you set the keyboard? Anybody here look up the position of @ and + for you if needed. <comment55766> Aaaah, option key is what I was looking for, thanks (I'm new to mac world...)
