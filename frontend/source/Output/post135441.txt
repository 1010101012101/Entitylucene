Mirror my iPad 2 screen on my Windows PC? <body> I can't find any app which mirrors my iPad's screen to my Windows computer screen. Since iDisplay has been removed from the App Store I have no other ideas. Any recomendations (up to $15) for a solution to mirror my iPad screen on my Windows PC display?  <answer135442> Try out Reflector by Air Squirrels.  It works very well on the Mac, has a windows version and also appears to have a trial version. You can make sure it works before spending money on a license.  <answer147788> Try annotate.net. It works on both PC and Mac has a full featured 7 day free trial and even after the expiration of the trial, allows u 10 minutes of free Airplay indefinitely. Can be used across multiple computers unlike Airserver or Reflector which is tied to a single computer.    <answer234609> I recommend to use following: http://www.x-mirage.com/x-mirage/ That helps a lot during development and testing  <comment160545> I use Reflector for precisely this, and it works fabulously. <comment160787> i found airserver and used it but reflector seems to do the same! thanks
