A 250 GB HDD stuck with one 180 GB partition <body> I have a 250 GB hard drive in my MacBook Pro, I used to have a 70 GB BootCamp partition installed, leaving the Mac partition to 180 GB. Now I no longer need to have BootCamp, so I deleted it using a Ubuntu live CD. The reason I did it this way was because after upgrading to Mavericks, OS X no longer recognised my BootCamp partition for some reason.  But after deleting the partition, my Mac partition got stuck on 180 GB, with no possibility to make it 240 GB (excluding the EFI and recovery partitions).

All I had to do, is the following, in the right order:  precode1. Go to Disk Utility &gt; 250.06 GB Hitachi HTblablabla &gt; Partition. 2. Click on "Recovery HD". 3. Click +. 4. Click - on the newly created partition. 5. Click - on the Recovery HD, which suddenly jumped from 650 MB to 62 GB. 6. Resize "Macintosh HD" to 249,72 GB. 7. Click "Apply". /code/pre  PS: it takes a hell lot of time to finish the process.
