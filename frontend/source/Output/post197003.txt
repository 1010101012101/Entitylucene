OS X Server - Internal Email for Domain <body> I run OS X Server 4.x on a Mac Mini. I currently have a domain example.com with Mail services setup and everything is working okay so far. My router has IMAP and SMTP port forwarded to the server. Mail service uses a SMTP relay to Mail Logic service for backup/filtering of mail if my mail server goes down.  Now I want to setup a subdomain for email - something.example.com. Is it possible to have it be internal use only? Basically my home automation devices will use this email to send mail to an actual user@example.com. That way my HA devices can't speak out into the web, but a user can get the email from the HA device from anywhere in the world.  I'm assuming I would just add the subdomain to Mail, setup my devices to have device@something.example.com and I should be good to go, right? Since my example.com public DNS has no way of knowing what something.example.com is, it should never forward out into the wild?
