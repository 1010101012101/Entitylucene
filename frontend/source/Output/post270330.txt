Terminal (bash) - copy files from Windows (SMB) shares without mounting <body> In past OSX versions, one could copy files from SMB shares like so:  precodesmbclient //my-server/foo -U USER%PASS -I 127.0.0.1 -c "get my.file"  /code/pre  However, in recent versions, codesbmclient/code has been replaced with codesmbutil/code which does not have copying capabilities. As far as I can tell, the only replacement is codemount -t smbfs/code. I am not aware of any way to install codesmbclient/code on OSX (Print file from terminal via smb).  Mounting is pretty annoying though:  ol liYou have to create a folder for the mount point (what if it already exists?)/li liIf the same folder has already been mounted on a different folder, codemount/code will fail (with a pretty misleading error)/li liThere's no "structured" way to tell which shares are mounted where (that I know of), meaning you'll have to codegrep/code/codesed/code the output of codedf/code to try and work around the issues above/li /ol  Basically I just want to reliably copy a file from an SMB share in a bash script, and the issues above make it more complicated than it should be (and already was before codesmbclient/code was dropped).  <comment339712> `[ -d /path/to/dir ]` tests whether a folder exists already, `mount` lists all mounted shares/drives. Combined in a shell script this should take care of all three issues. <comment339730> @patrix yes and now you have to parse `mount`'s output with regular expressions which may be tricky as domain and user information might be there (in different casing and maybe even differently qualified domain names, not sure). And you have to have different logic for whether it's already mounted or not, and probably add some `echo` calls that explain what's going on etc. All that instead of one simple `smbclient` command. <comment339763> That's what shell scripts and programming are for :-) But of course, smbclient would have been simpler. <comment339826> @patrix indeed, hence this question :) <comment339830> I would go with a script (but you would need to add more details to your question if you want me to write something :-)) <comment339870> @patrix Thanks but I already have a simple script (no regex, but I just assume that if `/Volumes/Foo` is non-empty then `//my-server/Foo` is mounted) which is good enough for my needs. I posted this question in hopes of finding some way of doing it without mounting, as one could have done in the good old days of `smbclient` :)
