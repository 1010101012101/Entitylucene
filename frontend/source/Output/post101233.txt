iPhone reset cache in iOS6 <body> I stupidly 301-ed my whole website from http to https without fully considering the effect.   My iPhone app had used http basic authentication. But now users are seeing "not authenticated" errors because the redirect is losing authentication information when going from http to https.  Is there a way to clear all web caches on the phone?  I have look at the Apple support articles but these are not working and they are not actively maintained.  ul lihttp://support.apple.com/kb/TA38615?viewlocale=en_US/li lihttp://support.apple.com/kb/ta38613/li /ul
