Mail PDF attachments shown as 0 KB <body> Since I updated to emmacOS Sierra/em (10.12.2) PDF attachment are shown with sizes of em0 KB/em and a preview is not embedded. Resetting Mail and even re-installing the whole macOS system (factory default, no recovery) did not help.  The only way to read the attachments is to view the e-mail raw data (kbd⌥/kbd+kbd⌘/kbd+kbdu/kbd) and then store it into an em*.eml/em file. The created ememl/em file can then be opened with Apple Mail via kbd⌘/kbd+kbdo/kbd and the attachment is readable.  What am I missing? My inbox is emIMAP/em not POP3 and my provider is posteo.de.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/l77my.png" alt="0 KB PDF attachment"  <answer281435> Go to Preferences - Accounts - specific account, and change the pop-up entry for Attachments from "all" to "last" (or however the "zuletzt" entry is called in english).  <comment354116> Herzlich willkommen!
