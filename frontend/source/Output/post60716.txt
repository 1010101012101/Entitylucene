Internet Sharing won't show under Share settings on OS X Server 10.6.8 <body> I need to use the Mac Mini Server running 10.6.8 as an access point for my team at the office.  When I go under codeSystem Preferences/codecodeSharing/code there's no codeInternet Sharing/code Option.  What to do?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Bn3sh.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer60735> had the same problem after some Apple update...  My solution:  ol lidownload pref pane on the following website:/li /ol  http://clickontyler.com/blog/2012/02/web-sharing-mountain-lion/  (the pref pane also works for Snow Leopard). This pref pane will allow you to quickly see in System Preferences if Apache and PHP are on and if not, you can switch it easily on again.  ol liyou might notice that in /etc/apache2/ you have a httpd.conf and a httpd.default.conf file present. First step: Copy httpd.conf to the desktop, second step: delete the httpd.conf file in /etc/apache2/ and, third step: rename httpd.default.conf to httpd.conf./li lidepending in your set-up you will have to take the '#' out on the LoadModule php5_module {and so on...} to re-enable php./li lirestart the web server./li /ol  Hope this helps.  Nick  <answer60786> The server OS doesn't offer the one-click Internet Sharing.  It can be done, although the server OS wants to be much more involved than the client OS.  ul liGo to your Server Admin.  /li liSelect your server and click NAT (if you don't see it, click your server name, then click the codeServices/code tab at the right, then put a check-mark at codeNAT/code.  Now, back at the left hand panel, click the codeNAT/code service you just enabled./li liOn the codeSettings/code tab, make sure codeIP Forwarding and Network Address Translation (NAT)/code is selected, and choose the proper codeExternal network interface/code./li liOn the codeOverview/code tab, click the codeGateway Setup Assistant.../code button./li /ul  At this point, unfortunately, I can't provide the details.  My 10.6.8 mini server is a DHCP client, so I can't continue with the assistant without altering my setup :(    Do reply though with the results of the codeGateway Setup Assistant.../code  <answer62341> Classic Internet Sharing like known from "consumer" MacOS X is not available in OS X Server. However, I found interesting hints in Apple’s Advanced Server Administration for 10.6 Snow Leopard and Apple’s support pages.  I think you want to configure emInternet Sharing/em with strongServer Admin/strong, which you should find in code/Applications/Server//code. I do not have a installation of OS X Server at hand, but there you should find emService Configuration Assistants/em. Apple description:     Server Admin has configuration   assistants to guide you through setting up services that require more   setup than a single configuration pane. The assistants present you   with all configuration panes necessary to fully enable a service.   You want strongGateway Setup/strong in emServer Admin/em:     The NAT Gateway Setup Assistant helps you quickly and easily set up   Mac OS X Server […] to share your connection to the Internet with your   local network.   (taken from Mac OS X 10.6 Server Admin: Understanding the NAT Gateway Setup Assistant)     This assistant helps you set up your server as a network gateway.   Launch the assistant using a button in the lower right side of NAT   service’s emOverview/em page.   Configuration might be a bit more complex than with emInternet Sharing/em, but I guess it should be manageable! Hope this helps.  <comment69986> That's nice but this is about `Web Sharing` and what I need is `Internet Sharing` to make the Mac Mini works as an `Access Point`, sharing the internet connection from Ethernet to AirPort, thanks. <comment70101> I have done this process like five times now, in `External network interface` there's just `Ethernet` available. but how do I get the other computers to join the network trough Mac Mini's AirPort? <comment72140> Obviously, this is more or less a dupe of [Josh’s answer](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/60786/26522). Hmmm.
