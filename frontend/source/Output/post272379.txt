Can't install programs and unlock settings on OS X 10.7 (Lion) <body> Whenever I try to install a program or unlock system settings on my old iMac (OS X 10.7) and it asks for an admin password, after I enter the password the password window just closes without anything happening. The padlock doesn't change in the settings, and with installations it stays at the window I was at without any response or change, leaving me only with the options to go back, close the window, or try to enter the password again (which of course doesn't work no matter how often I try).  I seem to have the same problem as is described in this support thread: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7260492?start=0&amp;tstart=0  The fix mentioned in this thread is as follows:     OSX apparently needs to regenerate a fresh auth.db from /System/Library/Security/authorization.plist.      This can be triggered in terminal with the following command: sudo mv /var/db/auth.db /var/db/auth.db.old      After rebooting the system everything works as it should be.    However, I can't find the file mentioned in the fix. Probably because I have an older version of OS X.  I already tried repairing disk permissions as well.
