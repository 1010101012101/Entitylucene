ps -fC someprogram not available <body> I am running macOS Sierra 10.12.1. As a terminal app I use iTerm2. It is not possible to do   precodeps -fC nginx /code/pre  which will give:  precodeps: illegal argument: nginx /code/pre  I cross checked with a Ubuntu docker image, there the above command works as expected.   Is it possible to install another version of ps to get this running?  <comment331510> @grgarside Thanks, now I get it.
