Copy pathname from Finder with tilde (~/) instead of absolute home directory <body> Since OS X El Capitan, right-clicking on a file in Finder while pressing "Option" shows a menu function emCopy "File.txt" as Pathname/em.  I wonder if I can replace the absolute path of the home directory so that I get the tilde as in  precode~/Documents/File.txt /code/pre  instead of  precode/Users/My-User-Alias/Documents/File.txt /code/pre  <answer293219> No.  The ~ substitution is a shell construct.  <comment371081> Thanks for your response. Would still be very useful for sev. actions. Wonder if there is no workaround (can't see that deep into macOS). Appreciate any help!
