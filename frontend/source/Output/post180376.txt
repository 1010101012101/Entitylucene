Unable to sign in with Jabber 10.5.1 on OS X (10.10.2) <body> I'm trying to get Jabber working on my OS X laptop with no luck..  I can get a windows version working on a VM running on this same Physical laptop..  OS X laptop Process:  ol liOpen Jabber/li liEnter login info - Correct info.  Was used with Jabber for windows client and successfully logged in - per below/li liClick Sign In/li liGet popup window to accept certificate/li liFinding services animation spins on the sign in window/li liEnd up getting Error “Single Sign On client error encountered communicating with server”/li /ol  I have a Virtual Machine running Windows 7 Pro, on this same computer with Jabber 10.5.0 and upgraded today to 10.6.1 (I know…version.....)  The VM Windows app logs in each and every time, with either version..  thanx  <comment214226> What application are you using when referring to "Jabber"?  Is it a third party app or is it Messages?  If you are trying with a third party app, how does Messages work when setting up a Jabber account? <comment214238> I'm actually using the OS X version of Jabber.  I tried Adium but no luck with that either.  I also tried adding the account to IMessage...  Again no luck...  When I say no luck - I don't remember the errors off the top of my head...  I'm onsite now but can try again later <comment214338> What happens if you create a new user on the client machine you are trying to log in to Jabber?  Does that work?  In case that worked, have you tried to remove preferences?  I gave a [response](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/80952/finder-stopped-opening-a-new-window-when-i-click-the-dock-icon/175970#175970) to a different question where removing and putting back helped.  It may be worth to try out. <comment214339> If it does not help, what happens if you add a new network location and try it then? Talking about certificates, have you tried to bluntly create the account ignoring the error, then disabled the secure connection?  Would it work then? <comment215056> New User did not work.  The Preferences section is not active ("Preferences" is greyed out).  I can reset it from the main window with no luck.  I haven't tried a new network connection yet..    Not sure what you mean by "create the account ignoring the error, then disabled the secure connection? Would it work then"  Can you please explain further? <comment215108> If it does not work on a new user (coming with a fresh set of preference files), removing preferences in the original user would not help.  So, do not worry about that. <comment215110> For applications like Calendar, Contacts and Messages, if there is an error creating an account, you can typically click on Continue/Create nevertheless, effectively creating the non-working account despite the errors.  This allows post-account-creation modifications to the connection settings (e.g. disable SSL, using a different port/server, etc.) allowing you to tweak settings which work for your connection.
