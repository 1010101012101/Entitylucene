El Capitan cmd-tab behavior with multiple monitors, separate spaces <body> Similar to this, but the behavior I'm seeing is even stranger.  I'm encountering some very frustrating behavior on El Capitan using multiple monitors with separate spaces for each monitor. When I cmd-tab between one program and another that has lots of windows scattered across the spaces (e.g. Chrome), sometimes OSX doesn't select a window of chrome that's visible on one of my two monitors - it goes and emchanges spaces/em for no apparent reason. It does change to a space with a Chrome window open, but it doesn't even select that window. I don't know precisely how to reproduce this, so I was wondering if anyone else had observed this behavior, and whether anyone knows how to fix it.   I know that disabling "Enable separate spaces for each monitor", as suggested in the linked question above, will eliminate this problem, but having separate spaces for my monitors is a big part of my workflow.   <comment264340> You're breaking the paradigm by having an app on more than one space. Your workflow would probably be more efficient if you used key commands to switch to a specific Space, rather than making the OS guess at which Space you want by cmd/tabbing. <comment264444> I didn't know that was a paradigm. Thanks for that! I'll give that a shot. <comment264447> Well, after trying it out a little, I realized that this doesn't always work because I need multiple windows of the same app (e.g. Chrome) on different monitors (i.e. different spaces), and often I like to have two different apps (e.g. Chrome and terminal) on the same space. In both of those cases it's hard to avoid needing to cmd-tab between them.  However, sometimes the cmd-tab behavior is as expected and the OS doesn't move between spaces\. Haven't pinned down when the OS changes spaces and when it doesn't.
