Trying to convert pdf to text for free <body> I am using OSX and would like to be able to convert pdf files to text.  I would like a free application to do this, as I am sure there must be some.  <answer155253> Multiple methods.  ol liUse Google documents (you will need a Google account)/li liUse Automator (some work required)/li /ol     You can use Automator to create a workflow that can extract text from   PDFs and save it as a text or RTF document.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KC0bS.jpg" alt="extract text from pdf"  or an app from the App Store, e.g. PDF to Text   <answer155349> codexpdf/code which I installed with ports:  precodeport install xpdf /code/pre  contains:  precodexpdf-pdftotext /code/pre  It does what you want for any PDF file which is coming from a text file (and not from an image):  precodexpdf-pdftotext PDF_file text_file /code/pre  <answer155356> Current version of strongAdobe Reader/strong (11.0.09) has a "Save as Other" item in its File Menu.  One of the options is strongText/strong.  The App is free, and does a decent job outputting text files. All images in the new document will be lost with the .txt format.  <answer229009> At Patrix’s request, here are the steps I used to install and use xpdf via Homebrew:  precode/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" /code/pre  Do what it tells you to complete the Homebrew installation, then execute:  precodebrew install Caskroom/cask/xquartz  brew install xpdf  pdftotext 98789_LogiqueAnalyse_232_08.pdf 98789_LogiqueAnalyse_232_08.txt /code/pre  The first file name was an existing PDF; the second is the destination.  The results were much better than with an (admittedly old) version of Adobe Acrobat.   <comment182621> Are you looking to extract text from PDFs which already contain text?  (i.e., you could copy and paste pieces out of them) Or are you looking to recognize text that is in image content? <comment195091> Does http://free-ocr.com help? <comment278688> The command, at least as installed by HomeBrew, is just “pdftotext”. <comment278901> @FlashSheridan Can I encourage you to post an answer covering "pdftotext" and how to install it via homebrew?
