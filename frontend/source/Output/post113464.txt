What is the problem here.  <answer113553> Found at /Developer, I found a way to uninstall Xcode via  precode$ sudo /Developer/Library/uninstall-devtools --mode=all /code/pre  I just ran the installer for Xcode 4, and it detected old version of Xcode, offering me to move it to /Developer-old.  <comment133141> Do you use the XCode in /Applications and not the XCode in /Developer/Applications? Your Mac OS X version is at least Mountain Lion up-to-date ?
