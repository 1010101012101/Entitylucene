Apple has ditched matte laptop displays: Display replacement options? <body> I was thinking about buying a MacBook Pro for coding while not at home, but suddenly realized that they all come with strongglossy/strong displays. The glare/mirror effect is utterly unacceptable for me. Are there good and easy ways to fix this?  By emgood/em I mean:  ul liNo voiding of warranty/li liNo other nasty visual side-effects (apart from slightly reducing overall brightness, which is OK)/li liNo noticeable additional weight/li /ul  By emeasy/em I mean, either somebody else would install it, or it may be installed by a very silly guy like me with near-zero probability of breaking anything. :)  <answer135507> Apple sells an Anti-glare filter on the online Apple Store.  An alternative is the Moshi iVisor which you can find on Amazon.  <comment160624> For what it is worth: I'd recommend using it for a bit before installing something that isn't easy to remove. I was of your opinion before I got my latest computer, very upset that I couldn't get a matte display, and about a week in it didn't bother me at all. <comment161872> I ended up not being bothered by reflections, looks like MBP with Retina has very good glass on the display. :) <comment247658> @SargeBorsch Yeah. Normally I hate glossy monitors and get dizzy for staring too long. but Retina display doesn't feel like it's glossy at all. It's totally fine.
