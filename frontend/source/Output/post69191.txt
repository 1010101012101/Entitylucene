Outlook calendar won't synch with iPhone 3 and software v6.0 <body> Microsoft Office 2010 was syncing with my iPhone 3 calendar until c. 2 weeks ago - I think it's an iPhone software upgrade issue? I have 2 email accounts in Outlook - a POP acct which I don't synch - but which is the main email acct and the one the calendar is linked to - and an IMAP account set to synch - this acct has stopped synching also.br I have tried all the iPhone settings / reset synch and Outlook add-in disabling suggestions etc on this site - do I need to set up the POP email acct on my phone also to see if this will get it back in synch? I didn't need it on the phone before for the calendar to synch.
