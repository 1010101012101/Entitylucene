Enable sudo without a password on MacOS <body> h1My Problem/h1  I would like to be able to run codesudo/code commands on MacOS Sierra 10.12 without having to type a password.  h1What have I tried/h1  I've read the following:  ul liWhy does sudo ask for a password in terminal?/li liallow sudo to another user without password/li liUse sudo Without a Password on Your Mac/li /ul  And changed the relevant part of my code/etc/sudoers/code file to:  precoderoot ALL=(ALL) ALL %admin  ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL %wheel ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL %wheel ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL %sudo   ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL adamatan ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL /code/pre  My local user id (codewhoami/code) is codeadamatan/code.  I'm still being asked to type a password every few minutes when calling codesudo/code. Any idea what's wrong?  <answer278870> Try setting NOPASSWD on the root user. In code/etc/sudoers/code  precoderoot            ALL = (ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL /code/pre  <comment323750> Does sudo -i work on Sierra? In El Cap it will switch you to root context and run login resource files for that session. (Will still need to be sudoers, so earlier effort not wasted). <comment324391> Works, but how does it solve the problem? <comment366838> I just recently upgraded to Sierra and ran into this. The default `/etc/sudoers` file has changed fairly  radically from El Cap. There I just dropped a one line config file into the sudoers.d directory and it "just worked". Seems things have changed. I'll report back if I get anymore info.
