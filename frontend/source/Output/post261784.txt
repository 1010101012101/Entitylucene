How to prevent screen lock when MacBook AC adapter is unplugged? <body> I use my MacBook connected to an external monitor via HDMI with the lid closed, and plugged in to AC power (in closed clamshell mode). If I disconnect the power cord (usually happens accidentally), the external monitor will lose signal, USB devices become disconnected and I need to enter my password and unlock the screen. Is there any way to prevent my Mac from stopping HDMI input when the power is unplugged in closed clamshell mode?  I'm aware of NoSleep and InsomniaX, they work fine for preventing sleep when the lid is closed but they don't prevent screen lock when AC becomes unplugged (with closed clamshell mode).  <answer262188> Just in case you weren't aware of these options, or haven't already tried this, you could change the Battery settings under Energy Saver.   Your question doesn't specify what version of macOS you're using, but here are some generic steps:  ul liGo to System Preferences  Energy Saver/li liSelect the Battery tab/li liSet Computer Sleep to Never/li liSet Display Sleep to Never/li liSet Graphics to Higher Performance/li liMake sure emSlightly dim the display when using this power source/em is unchecked/li liMake sure emAutomatically reduce brightness before display goes to sleep/em is unchecked/li liExit System Preferences/li /ul  Let us know how you go.  <comment328603> This is about closed clamshell mode, which specifically only runs when the MB is plugged in to AC power. OP is looking for a crafty workaround rather than some messing around in Energy Saver settings which won't do the trick. See newly linked article in question. <comment328610> Assuming you down voted me, I do appreciate you at least explaining why. :) Just for the record, I understood the computer was being used in clamshell mode, however I thought my suggestion _may_ help because the OP was referring to a problem that only occurs when the AC is unplugged, at which point the only power source is the battery. Thanks for adding the link to the OP's question, as presumably many users won't know what this is. <comment328646> I downvoted this because Closed Clamshell mode specifically requires that the MacBook be plugged in (again I'll direct you to that link, you are welcome for adding it) and thus messing around in basic system preferences most certainly won't do it. IMHO, this is akin to me asking how to take a live photo on an iPhone 6 and you saying to go into the camera section of Settings and mess around with a couple things. This will need a hackier solution than the one you've provided (which I am almost certain won't work) and thus downvote. If I am wrong and this does help the OP, I will upvote. <comment328756> Actually this worked. Setting "Turn display off after" to "Never" inside the Battery section does exactly what I need - not messing up everything if I accidentally nudge the power connector and it comes disconnected for even a split seccond. Thanks! <comment328802> That's fantastic! :) This was a great question because it applies to many users, so hopefully others will benefit as well.
