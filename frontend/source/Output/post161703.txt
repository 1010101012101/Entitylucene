My computer logs out and sleeps after two or three songs play on itunes <body> Recently I did some updating on my computer just to make the display better, change sleep length (extended, not shortened), and to add hot corners.    Well, now when we play up to two or three songs on iTunes, the computer logs the user out with no warning. I've gone to different timing settings, but I can't seem to find the problem.    Anyone know how to help?  <answer161711> Open codeSystem Preferences/codeâ†’codeSecurity &amp; Privacy/code, unlock the padlock if it's locked, and then in the codePrivacy/code pane click on the codeAdvanced.../code button. See if you've enabled "Log out after [x] minutes of inactivity".
