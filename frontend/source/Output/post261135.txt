replaced iphone5 back housing and camera does not work <body> I changed the back side of my iphone and the back side camera does not work. When the camera app is loaded it just shows black screen where objects must be shown.  Can you guess what the problem is? I thought it was because of the connection between the front assembly and the back one with the three ports(I mean those circuits somewhat like cables), so I reassembled that part but nothing changed.
