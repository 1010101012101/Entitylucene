Is this a virus? <body> I have been getting this ad popup for the last few months(green banner on the left). It happens on some web sites but not all.  Is this a malware infection on my Mac or the web host being compromised issue? How do I remove it if it is my Mac being infected?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MZo7a.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer187634> Another possibility is that your ISP is doing ad-injections.  <comment221821> Check your safari extensions. Could be adware addons. <comment221828> & run [Adware Medic](http://www.adwaremedic.com/index.php) <comment221872> It's not Safari extension. I only have a few legitimate extensions activated.
