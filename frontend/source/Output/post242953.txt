Write an AppleScript to combine multiple pdf pages in one pdf <body> I am designing a workflow in which multiple one page-long PDF files should be combined into a single PDF file using Folder Action Script.  If you have any script for that please share.  <answer243049> As Patrix said try Automator..img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/J3oJW.jpg" alt=""  <comment299013> Automator has some pre-built functionality for this, might be easier than AppleScript. <comment299018> I'm missing a real question as well as any research done by the OP here! Please show us your previous (failing?) attempts to solve your problem.
