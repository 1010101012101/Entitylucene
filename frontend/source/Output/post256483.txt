Is there any way to nest groups hierarchically in Apple Contacts? <body> I have a huge number of contacts.  If there is absolutely no better way to organize them than a "flat file" list of groups, I may be forced to export each card individually just so I can have them in a directory structure.  The things I love about Apple Contacts are:  ol liIntegration with Mail.app./li liIntegration with Alfred PowerPack./li liPretty UI./li /ol  So this is really a two part question.  ol liIs there any way to have hierarchically nested groups in Contacts.app?  And,/li liIf not, is there any other application I could use that would give me this functionality without sacrificing other usability too much?/li /ol  I have one possible not-so-great workaround myself, which I will post as a self-answer.  I'm hoping someone else has something better.  hr  P.S.: Using El Capitan 10.11.6.  <answer256484> The only possible "solution" I have (which isn't emreally/em a solution but it's what I will do if nothing better is suggested), is:  ol liTake everyone I don't emroutinely/em contact, export their vCards individually (not in batches) (this is so that quicklook will work), and delete them from Address Book (a.k.a. Contacts)./li liUse Contacts for my every day common contacts, and use either a directory structure and Quick Look, or some third party app, to organize all the rest of my contacts./li /ol  This compromise preserves integration with Afred and Mail.app for common contacts, and allows me to better organize unusual contacts.  But I'd prefer nested contact groups directly in Contacts.app.
