Add custom locations for calendar app <body> I have the following situation. I have an Exchange email account from my university which I use on my iPhone. I sync emails and calendar. All of my lectures are put on this calendar as events with lecture rooms put in the location field as text. Recently a new building on campus has been marked as a location on apple maps and calendar now recognises lecture rooms in that building as proper location which can be used to calculate travel time.  So my question is the following. Given that events have location as text room numbers is there a way to add a custom location (longitude/latitude) so that calendar will recognise it.
