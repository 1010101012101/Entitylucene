Can I delete part of an iMessage from OS X? <body> I would like to delete part of a message history, not all of it. I know how to do this on my iPhone and iPad, but can't find a way to do so on my computer itself.  <answer246003> Right click or ctrl+click on a message and hit "delete".   <answer246039> Click on the corner of every message you want to delete while holding the kbdCommand/kbd key to select multiple messages, then two-finger-click on one of the messages you selected and hit codeDelete/code from the dropdown menu.  <comment303273> In Messages, what happens if you control-click or right-click on an iMessage?  When I do, I get Forward..., Copy, Delete..., do you not get these options? I can select any given message and apply any one of the aforementioned actions and it acts only on what I've selected, not the entire message stream. <comment303393> I don't get these options. I get View, Look Up (the word that ends up being highlighted), Search with Google, Copy, Add to Wunderlist (!), Add to iTunes as a Spoken Track. <comment303394> Ahh...that's the difference! If I simply click within the message, I get what I just posted above. But if I make a point of clicking in the very corner of the message, I get the option to Delete. Thank you!
