How can I download Minecraft from Aptoide? <body> I am trying to download Aptoide through Safari to get the latest version of Minecraft, but it keeps sending a message that Safari cannot download this file. How do I do this?  <answer200720> From Aptoide (emphasis mine):       Aptoide is the largest independent strongAndroid app store/strong and allows one to setup and manage your own Android Store.    You cannot emdirectly/em run Android software on an Apple product.   Look for Minecraft on the iOS app store or download it directly from the official site for OS X.
