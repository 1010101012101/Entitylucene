Cannot sign in to Microsoft Messenger <body> Occasionally I am not able to sign in to Microsoft Messenger. I have to repeatedly retry and sign in for 15 minutes or so to successfully log on.   It wasn't a network or account problem. I could use meebo and it just log on and stays ok. What is causing my Messenger.Mac not logging on?  [EDIT]  On iChat, I do not see Messenger for Mac to be an option:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CYqAk.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment49414> As a comment, in case you aren't aware of, you can log to MSN from ichat. <comment49434> see edited question. No, I don't see that on iChat.. <comment49437> There is a free component which you install and you can do it. I have done it my self. Although you are only allowed to chat no video calls.Component is called Cocoon. Also  you can do it through jabber.
