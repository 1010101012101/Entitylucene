Is there any way to tweak or modify AFP to increase transfer speed? <body> I have a Mac Mini, MacBook Pro and Synology DS213 connected to a gigabit switch via cat6 cables. When I enable AFP on the DS213, I get ~60mbpsUP and ~700mbpsDOWN when accessing it from Mac Mini and MBP. I also get the same speeds when both Mac Mini and MBP access each other. When I turn off AFP on the DS213, and use SMB, I get ~300mbpsUP ~350mbpsDOWN when accessing it from the Mac Mini and MBP.   When I view a Wireshark capture from Mac Mini -- DS213, there are MANY "request tickles" and "FPwriteExt request(s)" during the AFP ~60mbps uploads.  Is there any way to improve AFP upload (write) performance?
