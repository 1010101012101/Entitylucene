How to get text from Facebook webpages using Automator? <body> I am managing a network on Facebook that has about 3 million subscribers in about 500+ groups... I used to extract text from those Facebook Group pages using Automator, after getting a huge text file I used to filter it with Excel and could collect the required information about my network number of Subscribers, Admins growth rate and so on...  The two actions I've used that no longer work are:  precodeGet Specified Urls (with all urls in my network) Get text from webpage /code/pre  After doing the last update of the OS, OS X El Capitan, I am unable to get the same results using Automator. Whenever I run the workflow all I get is the text from the very default Facebook page as an unlogged account or a non-subscribed user.  Seeking your support to help me writing a suitable script to do the same, I tried the scripts existing already on different websites, non of them are able to get the text I need.  <comment254046> Which scripts (from which sites) have you tried?
