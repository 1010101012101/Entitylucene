Brightness controls second monitor - Dell Ultrasharp U2414H <body> I'm a thinking of getting a second monitor next to my iMac (21,5", late 2013) but I would like to adjust the brightness from the keyboard. I'm aware that this is possible with a Cinema Display, because it connects via USB and mini-display. This is also the case with the monitor that I'm interested in, the Dell Ultrasharp U2414H (http://www.dell.com/ed/business/p/dell-u2414h/pd). Now I'm wondering if connecting it with USB and mini-display will make me able to adjust the brightness of the second monitor by pressing kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdF1/kbd or kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdF2/kbd?  I'm aware that there are certain applications available that will do the same job, but these don't always tend to work with the newest versions of macOS, that is why I would prefer to use to above described method.
