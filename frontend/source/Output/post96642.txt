What's the most recent Mac that will run Leopard? <body> We have edit bays (13) and use Mac Pro 2.1's and Mac Pro 4.1's both dual Xenon  quad core.  When a computer dies, we usually look for the same motherboard which are getting harder to find over time. Hackintosh and Quo are out - they seem too sketchy. We are looking for options to run Leopard to maintain compatibility with the SAN.  What is the most modern/recent motherboard or Mac that will run Leopard?   <answer97926> I think the Early 2008 Mac Pro (MacPro3,1) is the most recent Mac Pro to be compatible with OS X Leopard.   <answer97934> You have quite a few choices to run Leopard (10.5) on Mac hardware:  ul lihttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT1159/li /ul  Any Mac that shipped with a minimum version of 10.6 and higher will be unlikely to run well on Leopard as the drivers needed are usually in the builds listed in the right column of the list above.
