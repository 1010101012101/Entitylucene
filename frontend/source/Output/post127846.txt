Problem with updating apps in iPad 3 with iOS 7.1 <body> I have an iPad 3 with iOS 7.1. From April, 2014 I am having this strange problem. My iPad Apps won't update both manually and automatically. Every time I have to "Reset all settings" in the iPad and then only the apps would update. So please suggest how to solve this problem.  <answer128285> Did you Jailbreak your phone?  If no, try go to Settings-iTunes &amp; AppStore and turn on automatic updates. And make sure you have update you iOS version and check if you have enough storage space to download update.
