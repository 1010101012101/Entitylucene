Backing up whilst ignoring git repositories <body> I have a directory structure where some directories contain git repositories:  precodeprojects | +-- project1 |  | |  +-- file.txt |  +-- project2 |  | |  +-- codedir |  |  | |  |  +-- .git |  |  | |  |  +-- code.c |  | +  +-- notes.txt /code/pre  I'm trying to come up with a backup script which would backup notes.txt and file.txt in their proper place, but would either not back up codedir at all, or would leave only an empty directory there. How can I do this?  <comment364193> Welcome to Ask Different! :) While your question clearly demonstrates the problem being solved, it doesn't provide any details on what you've already tried.
