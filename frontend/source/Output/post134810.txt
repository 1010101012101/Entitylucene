Temperature logger compatible with Mac? <body> I'd like to measure the temperature in my fridge over a few days and graph the results, since I think the fridge may be starting to fail.  So I'm looking for a cheap device which can run independently on battery power, which logs the temperature and timestamp every few seconds to a file.  I want to plug this in to my Mac and retrieve the data.  I don't particularly need software to generate the graph: I can do this with Numbers, Excel etc.  This "RC-4" unit pictured below is the sort of thing I'm imagining.  However, it doesn't seem to be Mac compatible.  &quot;RC-4&quot; temperature logger http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41gpM2mhw2L._SX342_.jpg  Can anyone recommend a suitable product?  Alternatively, I could set up a Windows installation for this device in VirtualBox, but I wonder if that would handle the USB drivers correctly.  Can anyone offer any experience here?  <answer134816> The Go!Temp from Vernier works a charm for me! 50 USD with free software download.  <answer224465> If you are comfortable writing a few lines of Python, elitech-datareader seems to be an option to pull data from the RC-4 onto a Mac. I just ordered an RC-5 on eBay, and will update this answer once I'm able to test it out.  <comment159686> wow, that is expensive to confirm that the old fridge is old :)! <comment159745> Thanks - I hadn’t found that product. It looks well designed, and it is good to have native Mac software. But 1) it doesn’t run independently: it needs to be connected to a computer to operate, and I don’t have one near the fridge, and 2) it is more than twice the price of the RC-4. More suggestions welcome.
