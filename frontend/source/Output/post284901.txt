External Hard Disk Problem - doesn't mount / can't first aid / can't erase using disk utility <body> Dear fellow apple users,  I run MacOS Sierra 10.12.4 and struggling with my external 3.5 Data HDD not mounting after a short circuit in the Hard disk casing. I have purchased a new casing and have seen that the volume / partition still exists, but it is not mounting to the Mac. I had used disk drill data recovery and I can see that the partition exists and the data can be recovered.  The problem is: 1. I am unable to mount the HDD using disk utility as the mount is greyed. I can see two volumes / partitions but the mount option inside each of them doesn't work.  ol start="2" liI am unable to do First Aid on both the disk and the two partitions. The error is enclosed. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UrRBV.jpg" alt="Error while doing first aid on first partition or volume" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CkUPi.jpg" alt="Error while doing first aid on the whole external HDD"/li liI am not even able to erase the partitions or the disk. It gives the error shown on the screen - "Mediakit reports not enough space on device for requested operation."/li /ol  <comment359283> Looks like a failing hard drive to me. You may have to get a new one. Were you using this hard drive for anything recently? <comment359312> "short circuit in the casing"... that sounds expensive. Bin the drive & get a new one.
