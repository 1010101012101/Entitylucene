Can't grab edges/corners of windows for resizing <body> I have a problem with window resize since I've update my OS X to El Capitan edition.   I can not "catch" the edges and corners of windows to drag them for resizing.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TpZqe.gif" alt=""  It's not dependent on the app.  Magic moment when problem resolved by invisible man help. It's working for a couple of seconds and problem come back after successful screen size changes stops:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxvlwUMnoR4  <comment329632> What does "sometime with G help" mean? <comment329640> With nothing reasonable. same window, same session, same system state. Like invisable man press the magic button inside OS X logic to release that problem for a couple seconds. <comment329641> What app are you using to create that circle when you click in the window header? <comment329642> it's basic QuickTime app within OS X <comment329644> Are you using a wired/wireless mouse or a trackpad of some sort? <comment329645> It's wired USB mouse. It's not a position problem you can see it on the second video. <comment329665> Try this: Go to ~/Library/Preferences and move `com.apple.driver.AppleHIDMouse.plist` to your Desktop and restart. Then open System Preferences  Mouse and reset your mouse preferences.
