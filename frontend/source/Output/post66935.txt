Export vCF on a per contact basis <body> I am using Apple's Contacts app and I have hundreds of entries. Some are no longer valid (name change, incorrect phone, etc)  So I want to export them so I get 1 file per contact. This way, I can import them one at a time and work at each entry to make sure that it's correct. I also want to import them (one at a time) to my Microsoft Exchange account.  <answer66963> A simple way is to use a Automator workflow.  The Contacts Actions provide the option for you to do what you want.  Example: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/d4cKJ.png" alt="enter image description here"   Just be aware that card will not export if the Name fields have for example a forwardd slash "strong//strong".  ( as I just discovered)  <comment78910> Why don't you edit the entries in place, in Contacts.app? Just curious.
