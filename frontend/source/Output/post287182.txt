iOS: Safari: "Add to Home Screen" - wish to add the same thing to multiple iPads, is there a Mac solution for this? <body> I'd like to maintain, in a single place, preferably on the Mac, a list of "URLs added to Home Screen" -icons and dump them, either via wi-fi or via Lightning-cable, to a set of iPhones and iPads.  Which app should I use for this?  You see, I run a testing environment, and would just like to configure it for multiple different iPads with different settings (some of them will have different AppleID's set up, and some of them will be "my AppleID" and in "my use"). How would I do this type of syncing?
