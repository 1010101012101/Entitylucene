How do I enable Handwrite on the Google Search app for iOS? <body> I figured how to enable the Google Handwrite feature from Safari (Browse to google.com/preferences. and enable handwrite), but cant seem to find a way to do the same in the Google Search App for iOS.   Anybody been able to get around this?  <answer79531> I'm not completely sure, but I think that's just a feature of Google's mobile site. I don't know that there's a way to enable it in the Google Search App. Perhaps they will add this feature down the road. I'll edit my answer if I find it is possible.   <comment91814> That's what I thought too! Thanks <comment91821> No prob. I was wondering this same thing a few weeks ago lol. Their handwriting rec works well. I wish there was a (free) note-taking app that worked this well lol <comment91822> oh yeah...its pretty slick. Im just really surprised the search app doesnt have it already. You'd think...right?
