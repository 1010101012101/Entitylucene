Conditional highlighting of booleans in Apple Numbers <body> Is it possible to do conditional highlighting of booleans in Apple Numbers?  I want to highlight codeTRUE/code values one way, and codeFALSE/code values another, but booleans don't seem to be supported - only numbers, text, dates, durations and blank:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ush1G.png" alt="Screenshot"  I tried using "Numbers" = "equal to" but it didn't seem to accept my attempt at doing "equal to" codeFALSE/code.  I'm currently using Numbers 3.5.3.  One possible, hacky, workaround would be to change them from booleans to strings.  <answer224444> A boolean in Numbers seems to be represented internally as a String already. Setting "text is TRUE" and "text is FALSE" worked for me.  <answer224810> The OP does not specify how codeTRUE/code or codeFALSE/code are represented in the cell, but as was stated in another answer, using strongtext is/strong rule will work.  ul liText is TRUE add formatting/li liText is FALSE add other formatting/li /ul  This works for the result of a formula returning the text codeTRUE/code or codeFALSE/code.  If one is using numbers for Booleans, i.e.: code0/code or not code0/code then use a strongnumber/strong rule.  ul liNumber is equal to 0 [zero representing FALSE] add formatting/li liNumber is not equal to 0 [in the case of any number is TRUE] other formatting/li /ul  h3See screenshots for examples./h3  hr / img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uuYO1.png" alt="Conditional formatting for text"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/H2vHn.png" alt="Conditional formatting for numbers"
