How can I hide my dock but still not let windows be resized over it? <body> I'd like to hide my dock but have the bottom sliver of my desktop still always be visible.  I know that I can do something like this:  precode defaults write com.apple.Dock autohide-delay -float 100000000 &amp;&amp; killall Dock /code/pre  to hide the dock pretty much indefinitely (this makes it so it must be hovered over for 100000000 seconds to make it appear).  However, hiding the dock makes it so applications can be resized to the bottom of the screen.  strongHow can I hide the dock while still keeping windows from resizing past some fixed distance from the bottom of the screen?/strong
