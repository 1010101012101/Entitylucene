How to easily update Xcode from App Store when originally installed from developer site? <body> I need to update one of my machines to use the latest Xcode (it's my primary development machine so I've avoided updating it for a while, just in case of hiccups).  I originally installed Xcode on this machine from the developer site, but now it appears that it's only available on the Mac App Store.    No update for Xcode shows in the App Store, I assume this is due to the fact that I downloaded it from the developer site instead of the app store.  I can search for it and try to install it, but it appears that the Mac App Store wants to do a fresh install.  When I try to do the fresh install, it just sits there forever.  Are the two interchangeable?  Can I even do an App Store update if I installed from the website?  Better yet, does anyone know where I can just download an update without going through the App Store?  <comment230757> I think moving Xcode out of the applications folder (or just deleting it for that matter) should do the trick
