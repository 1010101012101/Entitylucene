I think I messed up the Fusion Drive on my 2TB iMac <body> I want to ask you how can I get back together my Fusion Drive (merge HDD and SSD together). I was installing Windows 10 and during installation it crashed and I was not able to boot in Windows neither OS X. I also lost recovery partition, so I am going to install it with internet recovery or with my installed OS X on my external HDD. Thanks for any advice  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/I9qyx.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer220891> Are you using Bootcamp or a Windows VM (aka Parallels) ? You can use the SSD as the boot drive for the applications and create a partition on the primary HD.  <answer220894> strongPreparation:/strong  ul liDetach any external drive (especially your external Time Machine backup drive)/li liRestart to Internet Recovery Mode by pressing kbdalt/kbd kbdcmd/kbd kbdR/kbd at startup.br The prerequisites are the latest firmware update installed, either ethernet or WLAN (WPA/WPA2) and a router with DHCP activated.br On a 50 Mbps-line it takes about 4 min (presenting a small animated globe) to boot into a recovery netboot image which usually is loaded from an apple/akamai server.  I recommend ethernet because it's more reliable. If you are restricted to WIFI and the boot process fails, just restart your Mac until you succeed booting.  Alternatively you may start from a bootable installer thumb drive (preferably Yosemite or El Capitan) or a thumb drive containing a full system (preferably Yosemite or El Capitan)./li /ul  strongRebuild Fusion Drive/strong  All data on the disks will be deleted.  ul liBooted to Internet Recovery Mode open Utilities â†’ Terminal in the menubar and enter:br codediskutil cs list/code to get a CoreStorage listing.  /li liCopy the Logical Volume UUIDs one by one, if any are listed.  /li liNow delete all Logical Volumes with codediskutil cs deleteVolume LVUUID/code.  /li liCopy the Logical Volume Group UUID, if any is listed.

So now I just want the factory settings, so I want to merge drives back together as they were before with original Fusion drive.
