How to fix an iPhone with half a screen showing a different color? <body> I have an iPhone 6. It screen was changed about 10 months ago and its battery was changed about 1.5 months ago. Yesterday, I suddenly noticed that half of the screen is darkened and with yellow-ish vertical lines. As far as I can tell, there was no immediate damage that was connected to this (i.e., no drops, or water damage, etc).  This appears to be a hardware issue and I don't know if it is related to either of the fixes.  Here is an attempt at a screenshot (which is take from my macbook):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/k1Qb6.jpg" alt="Half discolored screen"  Does anyone have an idea what this problem is and is there an easy way to fix this? Do I need to purchase another screen?  I don't live in North America, so getting a screen replaced will cost more than $200USD, so I would like to avoid that.  <answer282419> I would also try a full factory reset, like IconDaemon suggests. If that doesn't improve your situation, you have the following choices:  ol liGo to an official Apple store or a premium service provider to exchange your screen (this will cost you between 100 and 300$ depending on your location)/li liGo to an iPhone doctor or clinic which replaces the screen with a cheap aftermarket china one (Be very careful with this, most of the screens have a very bad quality and you can't get support from Apple afterwards. To check, if a screen is genuine, there should be no yellow glare and you can press firmly on the glass without damaging the display)/li liBuy a broken iPhone online and change the screen yourself as this tutorial on ifixit states: iFixit - iPhone 6 Repair/li /ol  <comment355666> Hardware issue. Try a full erase & restore (backup to iTunes first) but when it comes back looking like this, you'll confirm the hardware glitch for sure. <comment355673> Thanks. Probably hardware, but I will try that to make sure.
