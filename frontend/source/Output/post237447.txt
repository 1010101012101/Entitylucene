iOS Music - How to show both Artists and Compilations on the same view? <body> I thought that there's something wrong will all my compilations I upload to my phone. On iTunes those albums are correctly listed as compilations and artist is called "Various Artists" but I was unable to find them on my phone.  Then I realised that there's a dropdown (highlighted) that is responsible for displaying different stuff.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/49CTSm.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  When I click on "Artists" and from a given dropdown I pick "Compilations" I see those "missing" albums.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UQsTom.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  I would like to get those Compilations listed as artists under letter "V" like "Various artists". I don't want to switch between "Artists" and "Compilations" during the time when I switch between songs and enjoy music. Is it possible?  In general - all albums (no matter who's the artist on one big list).  Thank you.  PS. I don't know if that does matter but all albums are ripped CD's into MP3 from my Mac. Listed LPs aren't a stream from Apple Music.
