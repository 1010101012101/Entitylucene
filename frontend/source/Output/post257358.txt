Deleting all photos off iPhone! <body> Deleting all of my photos off my camera roll/iCloud and just wanted to make sure they will still be saved on my computer. iCloud has a setting where it has automatically downloaded everything onto my pictures on my PC. Will this collection of photos stay downloaded?  Thanks a lot!
