Can I teach my iPhone to autocapitalize? <body> My name is not an English word or common enough name to be in whatever list of proper nouns it has, and I always have to capitalize it manually. It doesn't even show up as an autocorrect option. Is there a way around this? It seems like a phone that can do so many things should at least be able to learn my name. iPhone 4 with iOS up to date.  <answer181989> I would define your name as a keyboard shortcut, so if your name were codenisht/code, I would set the phrase to be codeNisht/code and the shortcut to be codenisht/code.  To add a keyboard shortcut: Settings - General - Keyboard - Shortcuts.  <answer181990> Do you have yourself in the contacts application and have that contact selected as yourself? I believe that will add your name to the autocorrect list.
