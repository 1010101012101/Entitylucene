Why doesn't El Capitan Spotlight search in custom dictionary? <body> Since I upgraded to El Capitan, Spotlight has refused to look up for definitions in my custom dictionary (built by me). Instead, it sticks itself with Apple's default English-English dictionary.  Note that the custom dictionary:  ul liis already at the top of the dictionary list;/li listill works just fine with Dictionary.app and Quick Lookup (three-finger touch). /li /ul  Does anyone know why and have a solution or workaround to this problem?   Thanks a lot in advance.  <answer216721> Well, I managed to almost get it working by going to code/Library/Dictionaries/code and rename codeOxford Dictionary of English/code into something else. Then Spotlight started showing the results from dicts in Dictionary.app.  However, this is a rather kludgy solution for me because:  ol liYou have to Press Cmd+L in order to view translation, and there is no way to move 'Definition' up in Spotlight order/li liAfter I restarted my Mac, my Spotlight started to display result from another built-in dict, Oxford Thesaurus./li /ol  I guess, you could just remove all dictionaries that you do not use. Anyhow, maybe it could be of some help for you.  <comment253727> me too i used english to persian and now is english to english
