Synchronise folders on different Macs using rsync <body> I am trying to synchronise two different folders using rsync. I have copied all the data worth 4Tb from a network share to an external hdd using codersync -v -r /source /destination/code. Now I need to run regular backup to sync both the locations. Can anyone suggest rsync command which I can use to synchronise both the folders.  <answer248732> The best way is to continue to use codersync/code so as to maintain code/destination/code synchronized with code/source/code.  1st run:  precodersync -avE /source /destination /code/pre  next runs:  precodersync -avE /source /destination /code/pre  The code-a/code option = code--archive/code == code-rlptgoD/code.  The code-E/code option means copy extended attributes and ACL, and is mandatory on HFS+ filesystems.  strongWarning/strong: the standard version of codersync/code on OS X, version 2.6.9 (see codersync --version/code) still have problems with extended attributes. These problems will be shown thanks to the code-v/code option.  A verification of the output of codersync/code is mandatory.  This version 2.6.9 is too old and causing too many problems.  hr  I advise any user willing to maintain in sync directories between different Macs (or between a Mac and another Unix machine) to install codersync/code version 3.1.2.  Here is the method I use:  ol liinstall MacPorts: MacPorts home page  ul ligo to the Quickstart section, install codeXcode/code /li lichoose the right version to install (Mavericks, Yosemite or El Capitan)/li /ul/li liUpgrade your PATH so as to find the codeport/code command in it for example, I installed it in code/local/bin/code and modified my PATH like this:  precodePATH=/local/bin:${PATH} export PATH /code/pre/li liInstall codersync 3.1.2/code:  precodeport install rsync /code/pre/li /ol  With this version of codersync/code, the right options to use will be:  precodersync -avAX /source /destination /code/pre  and if you read me thus far, you are pretty good enough now to read  precodeman rsync /code/pre  to get the light from the source.  <comment268298> By synchronize, you mean that changes can occur both on the network share and on the external HDD and you want to sync them both ways? <comment268302> @patrix Yeah the destination folder should get updated from the source folder when i use the rsync command. So after running the command it should look for those files which has been updated on the network share and copy it on the destination. <comment304082> I think that the best way to do that is using cron. In cron you can specify to execute rsync all days at 8.00 am and 8.00 pm (for example). Doing that way you will have always a copy in both of them. <comment308295> @huseinasj: could you please completly reply to @patrix question. You have 2 locations of data: a `/source` and a `/destination`. When you talk of synchronisation, do you mean a one-way: `source → destination` or a two-way: `source ⟷ destination`? The **both** within your final question is leading to  a clear confusion. <comment308323> Can you provide (or link to) a simple instruction guide to install rsync 3.1.2 for those of us not very familiar with Terminal? Is this method reliable? http://gaborhargitai.hu/upgrade-rsync-on-mac-os-x/ <comment308406> Yes that is a pretty simple and correct documentation. But be warned, you have to get familiar with not `Terminal` but command line interface if you want to improve command line environnment. <comment308409> rsync 3.1.2 is also available from [homebrew](http://brew.sh) and you might find it simpler to install. Just these two lines: `/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"` and `brew install rsync` <comment308500> Thanks for the suggestion.  I ran the homebrew install, which was successful. But when I did the second command, install rsync, I got this:  "Error: No available formula with the name "rsync"  == Searching for similarly named formulae... These similarly named formulae were found: grsync                     librsync                   vdirsyncer "  Homebrew then suggested I run the command "brew install homebrew/dupes/rsync" which I did. Installation seemed to be successful but when I do rsync --version I still get 2.6.9    How do I get 3.1.2 to take its place? <comment308504> I tried running the original rsync install cmd again and got this:  brew install rsync Warning: homebrew/dupes/rsync-3.1.2 already installed <comment308512> Never mind.  I ran the cmds: brew tap homebrew/dupes then brew install rsync and all seems to be fine.  When I do rsync --version I get 3.1.2 :-)
