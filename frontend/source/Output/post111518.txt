How to undo "sudo rm -rf /etc/apache2/other/+php-osx.conf" <body> After I did this:  precodesudo unlink /usr/local/php5 sudo rm -rf /usr/local/php5-* /code/pre  To remove the supplemental configuration file that was installed with the updated PHP software, you may be able to remove the config file at /etc/apache2/other/+php-osx.conf:  precodesudo rm -rf /etc/apache2/other/+php-osx.conf /code/pre  Then restart Apache:  precodesudo apachectl restart /code/pre  php stopped running even when I see the version of php -- using  precodephp -v PHP 5.5.6 (cli) (built: Nov 14 2013 14:08:56)  Copyright (c) 1997-2013 The PHP Group Zend Engine v2.5.0, Copyright (c) 1998-2013 Zend Technologies     with Xdebug v2.2.2, Copyright (c) 2002-2013, by Derick Rethans /code/pre  Can anybody tell me why that is?  <answer111520> You can't undo what you did, unless you can recover the files from a Time Machine backup.

I guess, I need to add LoadModule php5_module /usr/local/php5/libphp5.so also. <comment131206> [warn] module php5_module is already loaded, skipping Syntax OK <comment131299> Sounds to me like you are loading telling apache to load the old module first, which doesn't exist or is broken, then when it encounters the instructions to load the new module it doesn't even try because it tried already...
