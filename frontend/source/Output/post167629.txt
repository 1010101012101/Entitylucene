How to delete tags from a large number of files <body> I have created by accident about 70 tags. by copying them into the finder tag window by accident.  I am using only 6 of them.  How can I delete all the 70 tags except those 6?  I tried to do it from finder but the process is so slow. I would choose some another method.  <answer167631> You can delete custom tags you created by going to "Finder--Preferences--Tags"  Then highlight the tags you don't want.  (To select multiple at once click one and then shift+click the last one).  Right-click and "Delete # Tags".  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YcAQ1.png" alt="enter image description here"  In your case, with 70+ tags, just use select all from the edit menu (Command A) to select all the tags. Then hold the option key to click the 6 tags you want to keep. Once the rest are selected you can mass delete them, leaving the few tags you prefer.  <comment196544> What I want is to delete the unused 70 tags... <comment196546> I see, so you want to get rid of the custom tags you created, not tags on files?  Edited above answer. <comment196551> Nice answer. I was also confused initially that the tags were on the files and not that it was a "tag management" issue that could be deleted easier. <comment196560> :) Thanks @tron_jones I accepted your answer (In the meantime I figured it out, but you deserve the point)
