Getting gnu screen to run on OS X El Capitan <body> Is there a way to get screen to run on El Capitan? This link contains instructions that are 4 years ago.  <answer249211> ol liDownload and install Homebrew/li liRun codebrew install homebrew/dupes/screen/code in a Terminal window/li /ol  There is no step 3.  However...  This will only install v.4.3.1, which was released in June 2015. Which is a lot better than the version 4.00.03 from October 2006 that Apple bundle with OSX, but still a release behind.  There has been one release since then (v4.4.0) which was released in June 2016. If you really want the latest release then if you ask nicely someone might submit a Pull Request to get Homebrew to update their version.  <comment309074> I'm missing any research here. Please add your problems with the instructions or submit error messages!
