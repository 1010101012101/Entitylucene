Can you transfer iPhone backups made on Windows to a Mac? <body> I made an iPhone backup on someone else windows computer and now need to send it to my Mac to restore my iPhone because it got bricked. If I simply send the file over a torrent and put it in the backup folder on my Mac's iTunes, will I have any trouble with restoring my device? I'm worried the format that iTunes on windows uses is different then on Macs'.   follow up question: Is there a better way then a torrent to send a file about 50gb?  <answer296216> The backup format is the same for Mac and Windows, so you can copy your backup from the MobileSync\Backup folder on your Windows computer to MobileSync/Backup on your Mac yes. If you need instructions for various versions of Mac and Windows to get the folders, here's a blog post I wrote with them.  If you have a USB thumb drive, that may be better to copy the 50GB backup :) You could also right-click on the folder for the backup and select Send To  Compressed Folder first to zip it.  <comment374121> You can mount samba shares on a Mac, send them via SCP, or use a USB stick. Torrenting is a terrible idea for sharing a file with 1 user.
