Hear ambient sound while listening to music with headphones on OSX <body> I don't want people to yell at me when they want to say something while I'm using headphones on my desktop computer.  I'm thinking an app could just listen to the ambient sound and lower the volume when it is loud. Apparently, Awareness does something like this on iOS. What about OSX?  <answer101956> Alternative approach:  try employing headphones that enable you to hear ambient noise?  My favorite:  http://www.earhero.com/  <comment118129> Better: detect voices in the ambient sound.
