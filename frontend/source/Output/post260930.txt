Messages app stopped sending iMessages <body> I've been having trouble sending messages (SMS and iMessage) from my Mac for a week or so now. I'm not sure if it exactly correlates with my upgrading to Sierra (10.12.1) but I have a suspicion that it's related to that.  Everything used to work flawlessly but now I can't send from my Mac. New messages that I receive appear on my Mac and iPhone (it's a 6 running 10.0.2) just fine. And new messages I send from my phone also appear on my Mac just fine too.  The below screenshot shows what happens when I click the code(!)/code icon.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/76Bc6.png" alt="after clicking on &quot;!&quot;"  <answer260932> I have had a similar problem in the past when upgrading OS. The easiest way to fix it I found was to disable iMessage on the faulty machine and then re-enable it.   To do this:  Messages  Preferences  Accounts  Click your iMessage account  uncheck "enable this account"  sign out  restart Messages  sign back in.   You may need to follow the steps above to recheck the "enable this account" box.
