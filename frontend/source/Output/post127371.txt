I login to unix machine using a VPN connection and then try to copy the directory using the following standard command   scp [[user-name@]source-host:]source-file-path [[user-name@]dest-host:][dest-file-path]  my problem is that i cannot figure out the [user-name@]dest-host:] part for my macbook. When i go to my mac system preferences i see two options  ol liComputer name : xxx.local/li liFile Sharing : on Other users can access shared folders on this computer at afp://xxx.xxx.x.xx//li /ol  I have also selected remote login option in service.  I would appreciate if someone can guide me about how to find out [user-name@]dest-host:] for mac os x version 10.7.5  <answer127374> You don't need to specify any host info for your local Mac.
