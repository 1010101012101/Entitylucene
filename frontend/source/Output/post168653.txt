Remove uninstalled applications from the Notifications system preferences <body> I noticed that in my emNotifications/em system preferences there two entries for Twitter (the old one with the white icon) and the new one.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Auv8A.png" alt="enter image description here"  The old Twitter application is long gone. How can I remove obsolete entries in the list?  <answer168665> I have two entries too, but they are not old and new. One is Twitter App, the other is system "build-in", this Twitter account for share(for example, click share button on Safari you can see it) and many other things.  You can check, "System Preferences"-"internet account".  <answer168900> If you click on the Help Center (?) icon (lower right of the Notifications pane), it says: emTo remove an app, drag it to the Not in Notification Center list/em.  Apps can be rearranged in the Notification Center by dragging them up / down in the list. 'Not in Notification Center' is at the bottom of the list. drag the app(s) you don't want to the very bottom, until you see a horizontal line appear beneath Not in Notification Center, then release. i'm not sure, however, if this will permanently remove the app from the list of apps in the Notification Center.  <comment198006> This is probably right, since I do not have any Twitter app, but I have a Twitter account set in Preferences and I see Twitter in Notifications prefs. <comment198300> I was wandering how to make the notification center not to show uninstalled applications (regardless if in the first or second list)
