How to turn-off the heuristic guessing of (kanji + okurigana) while doing Japanese input? <body> The Japanese input method has changed on my Mac. The traditional way on emOSX/em strongand/strong emWindows/em is:    ol litype hiragana for the word;/li lipress space bar;/li liuse arrow keys to select (kanji + okurigana);/li lipress enter./li /ol  Somehow, (95% sure this because of emEl Capitan/em) my input method has become:  ol listart typing hiragana;/li liwhile still typing hiragana, it continues to take heuristic guesses at the (kanji + okurigana) that I might want. This approach makes most sense on mobile phones, but I don't want to do this on my MacBook!/li lipressing codeesc/code reverts the guessed (kanji + okurigana) back to only hiragana (what I want), but then type another hiragana, and it starts to guess again... this is driving me crazy./li /ol  What language settings do I need to adjust so that I can input Japanese as I always have?  <answer223895> That is indeed a new feature for El Capitan:      strongMac becomes even more fluent./strong        strongJapanese/strong        strongLive conversion for keyboard input./strong        OS X El Capitan dramatically improves the ease and speed of entering Japanese text. With an enhanced vocabulary and improved language engine, it automatically transforms Hiragana into written Japanese as you type â€” eliminating the need to press the space bar for individual word conversions.   You can disable strongemLive Conversion/em/strong under codeSystem Preferences &gt; Keyboard &gt; Input Sources &gt; Japanese/code, or the shortcut in the Input Menu Item by clicking codeOpen Japanese Preferences/code:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Vk7yG.png" alt="enter image description here"
