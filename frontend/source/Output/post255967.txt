Stop accidentally forwarding voicemails with Verizon <body> For weeks I've been missing voicemails. I've recently found out they've been going to somebody on my contacts list.  Could I have somehow accidentally set this up? If so how do I undo it? My carrier is Verizon.  <comment319039> Welcome to Ask Different. It would help us if you provided additional info, such as the types of devices, OS, etc.  Also let us know what you've already done to solve the problem yourself.  Please see [ask] for how to ask good questions that have a better chance at being answered. - From Review <comment319042> I'm not sure what model of iphone I have or how to find out. does it really matter to the question though?  to fix this so far I have dialed the offending number and told them to stop stealing my calls or else(in case this is a prank/stalker), and I have asked you(in case it is not). <comment319045> the question is "is it possible to forward voicemail automatically from my inbox to another phone. either through apple or verison"  or if not, is it possible I have call forwarded in general and not noticed, if so how can this be reversed?  I do call this person rather often and immediately ring back if the call had gone to voicemail  if this helps.
