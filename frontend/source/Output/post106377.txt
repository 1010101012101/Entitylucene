internal SATA to external (eSATA) port extension for Late 2012 Mac Mini? <body> Is there an aftermarket or home-brew solution for extending the 2nd internal SATA port in a strongLate 2012 Mac Mini/strong (not earlier or later versions!) to the outside of the case, i.e. turning it into an eSATA port, with or without permanent modifications.  ( I am emnot/em asking about Thunderbolt-based adapters, I have already researched those extensively, they are either too slow (LaCie Thunderbolt Hub supports only SATA2, not SATA3) or too expensive (i.e. SonnetTech solutions.) )
