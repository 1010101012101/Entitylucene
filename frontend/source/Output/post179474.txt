Bootcamp puts content in Macintosh Harddrive <body> I am using Paragon HFS+ for reading my Macintosh hard drive in windows but when I open my Macintosh hard drive I saw lot of window's garbage that I never kept inside of it. Can I delete .exe files and EULA stuff? How to stop windows from keeping it again automatically to Macintosh drive?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UtOOx.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer179477> If I remember correctly these files belong to the VisualC++ redistributable. When the installer runs it extracts these files to the root of a drive and then installs to the correct folder. Once the install is complete, these files can just be deleted.  This isn't really anything to do with Boot Camp.
