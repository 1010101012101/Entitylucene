How to bring back Mac Notes from external drive? <body> I recently erased my hard drive and installed Sierra from USB flash, to start fresh. Before doing this, I copied the main 3 files of Notes to external drive. These are: NotesV6.storedata, NotesV6storedata-shm, NotesV6storedata-wal I copied them from: com.Apple.NotesDataLibraryNotes  I drag the existing V6 files to the desktop, and instead I paste the copied ones from external drive.But nothing happens. I'm probably doing something wrong...  <answer268233> You probably need to enable the "on my computer" account first. In retrospect you should probably have used iCloud for storing your notes instead.
