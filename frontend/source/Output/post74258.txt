Safari auto correction jumps <body> For a pretty long time I have the problem that the auto correction in Safari doesn't always work as it should. So it often happens that I write a word, and on pressing the spacebar it replaces the written word. Sometimes it also replaces the word after I have written the next word, and it jumps back. Really annoying as I often have to put the cursor back to the end of the textfield. I've already tried to completely deactivate and reactivate the autocorrection but after a few days it happened again..
