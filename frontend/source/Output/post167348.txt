How to put Eclipse for JEE and Eclipse for CPP in Launchpad on Mac at the same time? <body> I am trying to put the two different Eclipses into the Launchpad at the same time. But it turns out that Launchpad only show one of them no matter what I did.  What I have done:  ol liDownload the two Eclipses/li liExtract them/li liRename the dir for Eclipse JEE to be eclipse.jee and Eclipse CPP to be eclipse.cpp/li liMove the two dirs to /Applications/li liChange the Eclipse.app to Eclipse.jee.app for JEE and Eclipse.cpp.app for CPP/li /ol  In my case, I do see the Eclipse.jee shows up in the Launchpad, but no Eclipse.cpp.  What I have tried:  I noticed the Info.plist files under code../Eclipse.{jee,cpp}.app/Contents/code for JEE and CPP are the same, so I think there might be something to change within the file to let Launchpad know that the two things are indeed different…  ol liChange the CFBundleIdentifier/li liChange the CFBundleName/li /ol  However, changing those two attributes for one of the Eclipse just did not make any difference and Launchpad still show one Eclipse…  Has anyone successfully solved this problem? I know I can always execute them via terminal, but I just want to put them into Launchpad so that I can start them more conveniently.
