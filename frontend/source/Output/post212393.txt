Remove the Notification Center icon from the Menu Bar <body> I would like to remove the Notification Center icon like I could in Yosemite.  I'd like to not see it in the menu bar (to the right of the spotlight icon).  <answer212763> So you can easily disable it with  precodelaunchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.notificationcenterui.plist; killall NotificationCenter /code/pre  You can remove the icon with  precodesudo rm /System/Library/CoreServices/SystemUIServer.app/Contents/Resources/menuitemNormal.pdf  /code/pre  but the blank space will remain.  There is an app called Bartender I've seen a few people promoting to fix this issue.  <answer231436> To follow on @walshie4's answer above: The second command will not execute with El Capitan due to System Integrity Protection.   You must first boot into recovery mode, start a terminal and execute the following:  precodecsrutil disable; reboot /code/pre  Also note that after deleting the menuItemNormal.pdf file, the area is still a blank clickable space.  <comment256464> How did you do it in Yosemite? What happens when you try that method now? It might be helpful if you post some screen shots and elaborate more. <comment256491> Seems pretty obvious the OP wants to modify the icons in their Mac menu bar, no? @CalebKleveter <comment256496> @bmike, it wasn't obvious until I read your comment. Thanks for the explanation. <comment256651> In yosemite the command: launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.notificationcenterui.plist  removed the icon. In El Capitan the above command simply disables the icon from working but leave it in the menu. @CalebKleveter
