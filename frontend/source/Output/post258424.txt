Spam iCloud Calendar Invitations <body> Today I've suddenly received spam calendar invitation for $19.99 Ray Ban sunglasses (never subscribed, checked, searched or visited any related site, so clearly spam) and it has other visible email accounts within the invitation.  I'm wondering if I should be worried about this? Has any of my accounts been compromised or is it as simple as they have my email from anywhere and sent out an invitation like any spam email?  Questions to be answered:  ol liWhat should I check/setup in order to make sure my iCloud account is safe?/li liHow can I delete this invitation without sending a notification to the sender, so as to prevent them from knowing my email address is live?/li liHow can I prevent these notifications in the future?/li /ol  Googled this problem but couldn't really find anything.  Here's an image:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sx1cE.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer258468> I've had the exact same email. I've managed to get rid of it by doing the following:  ol liCreate a new iCloud calendar - I called mine junk/li liMove the spam invite to the new Junk calendar/li liDelete the newly created Junk calendar with the spam appointment in it - ensuring you select the 'Delete and Don't Notify' option in the Dialog box that appears./li /ol  This worked for me - I hope it works for you too.  <answer259750> Regarding how to prevent this in the future (question #3):  ol liLog in to iCloud Calendar on a computer web browser/li liAuthenticate if needed, then select the Calendar view/li liSelect the Settings Gear icon ⚙ in the bottom left corner then hit strongcodePreferences.../code/strong/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JffUm.png" alt="preferences"  ol start="4" liSelect strongAdvanced/strong/li /ol  Choose the option to receive calendar invitations by email instead of allowing the server to insert them without review into your calendar:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YYIua.png" alt="Email invitations setting"  ol start="5" liSelect strongcodeEmail to [youremail]/code/strong instead of codeIn-app notifications/code/li /ol  You now get to decide and delete or process calendar spam like regular email spam, allowing you to filter out these spam calendar invitations systematically.   <answer262396> This doesn't currently seem possible using the accepted answer, at least if the inviter is in your contacts - it needs some sort of action from Apple. Please make a comment if there is extra privacy against invites from people not in your contacts (I thought it worth making an answer for this, given that information still seems to leak).  I tried the accepted answer: sent an invite to my iCloud account from a different iCloud event and followed the accepted answer. The sending account saw the event as declined. It's not clear whether spammers can see this using their method but it's strongemdefinitely/em/strong possible that they can.  I also tried moving the invite into a Junk calendar without deleting it and even this action can be seen - the inviter sees something like "Deleted from Home".  <answer262955> With regard to #2 (how to delete without sending a notification to the sender) -- I don't have an answer yet, but I can confirm that the up-voted answer from Jackal above ("move spam event into temporary calendar, then delete temporary calendar") strongstill sends a DECLINE to the sender./strong  Understandably many folks here and in other social media venues that are sharing the workaround have strongmerely trusted/strong the "Delete and Don't Notify" button on the calendar-with-open-invites-delete warning to do what it says it does.  This, however, is Stack, where we should promote testability, repeatability and empirical evidence in general.  This is simply tested and currently repeatable on latest build of macOS and Calendar at this time of writing: simply have another iCloud user send you an invite, and have them watch your acceptance-status change from NO REPLY to DECLINED, the moment you click "Delete and Don't Notify" on for that temporary calendar.  So far, @AppleSupport has yet to respond with anything except "PM us with your device and OS versions."  In the meantime, I have 5 spam invites filling my calendar that I'm not touching.  And no, I am not interested in turning OFF the direct-from-email-to-calendar feature, as it is a good feature, it just needs "show invites in calendar automatically, but only for senders in my contacts" and a "swipe-left-to-delete-the-invite" ... and then actually NOT send a decline.  <answer264615> Apple made a 'report junk' button inside the calendar app on iCloud.com - when you report an invite it will be deleted across all synced calendars.     If you get an invitation that you think is junk or spam, you can   report it to iCloud.      ol   liSign in to iCloud.com with your Apple ID, then click Calendar./li   liOpen the event you want to report, then click Report Junk./li   liClick OK./li   /ol      The event is automatically deleted from your calendar on all your   devices where you’re signed in with the same Apple ID.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZbIPS.jpg" alt="Screenshot iCloud.com Calendar"  <comment323041> Could this have resulted from your account being hacked during the massive Yahoo hack? <comment323043> Don't think so. I've changed my password immediately after the news had started to spread. But it's a good point! This is probably how they've got my address. <comment323097> Hmmm... Nice idea, though didn't work for me :( Actually, since I did not reacted to the invitation in any way (neither accepted it nor declined) I cannot _move_ it anywhere, but only copy it. Which does not help :(. How did you moved this spam invitation to other calendar? <comment323123> I made sure I didn't react to the invite either - didn't want to acknowledge that they'd found a real account and then get inundated with more spam. Once I'd created the new Junk calendar I went back to the invite, right clicked, selected calendar and then the new Junk calendar from there. This transferred the spam invite without responding to it. Since it was the only item in the new calendar I just deleted the whole calendar! <comment323126> Perfect! It worked! :) <comment324774> Same thing just happened to me today, for the first time. I have a secure iCloud password and don't reuse it on any other sites. <comment325003> Ugh, same here. Doesn't look like there's a good way to fix it. Watching this thread to see if someone comes up with something. <comment325262> I've checked today - and it appeared that this option was set up exactly as you write BEFORE I got that spam into my calendar. So I think that this won't help to avoid it in the future... :( <comment325528> Thanks, this exactly worked for me. I found I could not move the Spam calendar event to a new Calendar because the mechanism was done directly in iCal and I did not have permissions to write to the spammer's calendar. But once I changed the event notifications to be via email, I found it not only prevented future instances, but, also allowed me to delete the existing events because the "decline" was now sent via email.  This answer is actually the real fix.  (except for the part where Apple has to now have a "spam calendar event" button). <comment325661> The suggestion of moving calendars worked perfectly for me. If you go into calendars click at the bottom to show all, if you edit you can add a new one to iCloud called spam. Then go to the spam invite it shows which calendar is assigned to click that and select the new one. Then go back to Show all calendars and delete the Spam grouping , it says it deletes all emails associated. <comment326495> This is the best answer for preventing future spam.  Thank you. <comment326515> @DenisRasulev I tested with a friend and confirmed new invitations went exclusively to email and not to my calendar. Could you check again? <comment327283> It definitely is not due to the Yahoo hack. I don't use Yahoo and yet I started getting them as well. That's not to say that the Yahoo hack might not have been involved at some point but it isn't the main reason. <comment328253> How do you know for sure that no response is sent? <comment328340> Has this changed?  I don't see this option.  Has this changed with a recent update? <comment328356> This is *not* good advice. I checked this using an iCloud invite from another account - the dialogue that comes up when you delete the junk calendar offers the option to delete the calendar and not notify. However, my status is updated to declined in the calendar of the person who sent the invite. It is possible that spammers can still detect your email address is real if you use this. <comment328397> @RLH Go to Advanced - it's still there as of this moment. <comment328652> @RLH - Make sure you're in the calendar preferences, not the general iCloud settings - I made that mistake. <comment328762> This is not an answer, it should be a comment. <comment328763> It's somewhere in-between. Based on what I've seen, the accepted answer is wrong and the current answer to most of the question is "no, it's not possible to prevent this". Answers can change over time if new information comes to light. <comment328782> Note that icloud.com won't work on an ipad unless you're using a browser like Chrome that allows you to open the URL as a desktop site.  The user-agent filtering is a really stupid limitation. <comment328840> the calendar invite does show the other victims too. it just looks like brute-forced email-guessing. Apple just needs to do better filtering <comment328877> I agree the accepted answer is less than ideal. I've put a [bounty on the answer currently with the most votes](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/259750/5472) to indicate it's a nice way to prevent this class of nuisance as opposed to dealing with each instance. <comment328921> @bmike 1. I've changed accepted answer (didn't know this was possible) so your comment / bounty may need to be updated, if so is required. 2. By the time previous answer was accepted, it was the only one that solved the problem. 3. Is there a need to change question / answers so they could be more helpful to the community? <comment328939> @DenisRasulev - you can always change the accepted. Bounty will help others see the fix so o harm there (that I see). I don't see any need for edits. Good questions though. <comment328974> I can't believe that Apple still hasn't resolved this problem <comment329029> My resolution has been to move my calendar events from the iCloud account to my other calendar account, and disable the iCloud Calendar feature (on my iphone and mac). The root issue seems to be spam blasting of @icloud emails, but i have found no way to *change* my iCloud email address to make it a lengthier email address. <comment329208> OK Onlines! Great site. <comment329209> Wow, the website linked in the image ("OK Onlines") was shut down for copyright claims "pursuant to a US federal court order" with a great message on the homepage. <comment329298> David Sparks has [a good write-up of this problem](https://www.macsparky.com/blog/2016/11/how-to-fight-calendar-spam). <comment329433> Down-voters ... care to elaborate on that choice? Other comments mention the same thing, but at the comment level, they're not being seen, and folks coming here for good advice, are not noticing the BAD and un-tested advice that's been voted up.  Unconcerned with down vote, very concerned with bad advice being continually passed around. <comment329652> [Apple has recently acknowledged this problem](https://9to5mac.com/2016/11/30/apple-apologizes-for-icloud-calendar-invite-spam-actively-identifying-and-blocking-senders/) and said they're working on a solution. <comment329818> @NathanWilliams You can request Desktop version in Safari as well as you can with Chrome on iPad, so it's easy to get it on iPad in Safari too. Just hold down the refresh button. <comment331553> Apple has added a "delete junk" link to events  in iCloud.com <comment331791> The iCloud.com Calendar interface now lets you [report invitations as spam](http://appleinsider.com/articles/16/12/12/apple-activates-icloudcom-calendar-spam-reporting-feature).
