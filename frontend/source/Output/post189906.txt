How to make 64-bit guests available in a nested VirtualBox installation on an iMac 5K 27-inch? <body> I have installed VirtualBox inside of VirtualBox.  ul liHost OS: OS X Yosemite/li liGuest OS: Ubuntu 12.04/li liBoth versions of VirtualBox: 4.3.28/li /ul  The guest versions in VirtualBox installed on Ubuntu 12.04 are only 32-bit.  How can I make 64-bit available?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ynl7s.png" alt=""  <answer189956> At the present time VirtualBox does not officially support nested virtualization, even thought one can nest a 32-bit Guest a 64-bit guest cannot be nested as VT-x is not passed through to the nested Guest and it's one of the requirements to run a 64-bit Guest, nested or not.  VMware Fusion does support some nested 64-bit Guests although off the top of my head I'd have to check the documentation to be more specific.  You can have a look Running Nested VMs at VMware's website.  <comment225510> Thanks, but I couldn't find anything helpful. I have installed Fursion 7. If you find anything specific I'll be happy.
