Keychain prompts on mac osx restart <body> Using MacOSX Yosemite, each time I restart my macbookpro and sign in, I'm prompted from multiple apps that want to use codeLocal Items/code keychain. Apps such as:  ul licom.apple.iCloudHelper.xpc/li licloudd/li lietc.../li /ul  Prompt looks like:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UkmdLm.png" alt="enter image description here"  I'm able to log in with my password, yet if I enter that same password into these prompts, it is not accepted.  So,  a) How can I fix my keychain such that these apps can simply use their required keychains on each login  b) If I'm able to login using password x, why won't these apps accept keychain password x?
