Changing path of Xcode Server <body> I'm running Xcode Server on my Mac Mini, and the HTTP port is open to the internet. I want to be able to host other content on port 80.  Is there a way I can change the path where the Xcode Server webpage is hosted?  To clarify, I want to access Xcode Server by typing either codehttp://host.name.tld/xcode/code or codehttp://host.name.tld:43211/code, rather than it being the root document served on port 80. I can't find anything to this effect in the auto-configured Apache config file.  <answer115807> First, make sure you are looking at the right apache config.  Base OS X includes a config file, but the one used in Server is at code/Library/Server/Web/Config/apache2/sites/code.    The two lines that makes Xcode the default is in code0000_any_80_.conf/code:  precodeDocumentRoot "/Library/Server/Web/Data/Sites/Default" DirectoryIndex index.html index.php /xcode/ /wiki/ default.html /code/pre  That means Apache will look for an index first in code/Library/Server/Web/Data/Sites/Default/code, but if there isn't an index file, it will try to use /xcode/ as the index (and will fall back to the wiki after that).  To override it, all you need to do is put some content in index.html. After that, you will still be able to access Xcode server in http://host.name.tld/xcode  <answer115808> You can do this with the OS X Server app.  ol liOpen Server.app./li liGo to the Websites service.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VbJow.png" width="200"/li liDouble-click your server website in the list.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MNtkm.png" width="200"/li liClick Editâ€¦ for Index Files.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aWbmS.png" width="320"/li liDelete /xcode/ from the list.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fIVc3.png" width="400"/li liClick OK on both boxes and wait for the service to update.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zlAml.png" height="30" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/X920x.png" height="30"/li /ol  Then Xcode will only be accessible from host.name.tld/xcode  <answer237373> In an effort to keep this somewhat up to date, deleting Xcode's config file  as suggested by Apple Support seems to do the trick: code/Library/Server/Web/Config/apache2/other/COM.APPLE.WEBAPP.XCODE.conf/code  The server root no longer strongalways/strong redirects to codehttp://example.com/xcode//code, and Xcode is still accessible via codehttp://example.com/xcode//code.  Now, if someone knows how to make it emonly/em accessible via a specific subdomain (codehttp://xcode.example.com/xcode//code), I'm all ears...  <comment134773> For clarification: What exactly do you want to change: The Port (80) or the path (where the files are) ? <comment134777> Well, either, actually. But I'd like to access http://host.name.tld/xcode instead of it being the root. <comment135623> Excellent, thanks! <comment255801> Didn't work for me, unfortunately.
