My iPhone settings are not showing Siri <body> I have an iPhone SE with iOS 10.3.1. The Settings app does not show the Siri option. I want to enable emHey Siri/em and I have restrictions disabled.  Here are some screenshots:  strongSettings View/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1kb6d.png" width="350"  strongInside General Settings/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sNvky.png" width="350"  strongInside General Settings Scrolled/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/I1nmW.png" width="350"  strongInside General Settings bottom/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JKc7J.png" width="350"  How do I enable emHey Siri/em?  <answer284172> Does Siri turn on when you hold down the Home Button?  The only problem of why you don't see Siri is the restraints,then try to enable them on Siri (looks casually if it appears in the settings) and after remove.  Try to press the Home Button and the Power Button at the same time,for about 10 seconds,until you see the Apple logo.  <answer295224> I had a similar problem, and Reset All Settings fixed it for me.  <comment358324> Can you please edit your question to include a screenshot of your Settings? <comment358334> More specifically, the grouping between **General** and **Privacy**. <comment358409> What iPhone version? <comment358510> @JashJacob Iphone SE <comment358511> Siri does work when home button is pressed for few seconds (2-3 seconds),  also I have already restarted iphone but to no avail. <comment358512> What's your iPhone model number?  Go to `Settings - General - About` and post your `Model`.  Also, what country are you in? <comment358516> @fsb model is MLXP2HN/A, country is India <comment358520> It should work with that model in India.  The only other thing I can think of is to do a 1) reset network settings and if that doesn't work, 2) reset all settings.  Something is messed up with Settings and doing a reset might be the only thing that can fix it.
