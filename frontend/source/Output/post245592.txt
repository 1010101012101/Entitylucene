El Capitan : How to disable Force Click "Dictionary Pop-ups" in Chrome? <body> In my Chrome Browser, whenever i "Force Click" (hard clicked by one finger) upon a Word, the dictionary lookup Pop-up is always popping out.  Like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6KeG7.png" alt="enter image description here"  I have already DISABLED the "Force Click" setting in the Trackpad Settings:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KvB57.png" alt="enter image description here"  And then already Restarted the Chrome. And also did (related or not) the:  precode$ killall SystemUIServer /code/pre  But this annoying strongpop-up (Dictionary Lookup) is still there/strong. I'm sure it is not a Chrome Extension.  What should i do to totally get rid of that, please?  Thank you all!  <answer248067> You have to also uncheck "Force Click and haptic feedback" at the bottom of the Trackpad Point &amp; Click settings.  <answer253893> Switch 'Look up &amp; Data Detectors' to 3-finger tap.  You can then re-enable it.  This avoids disabling force touch entirely.
