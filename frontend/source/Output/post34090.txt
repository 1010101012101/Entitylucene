Enabling remote login without password authentication <body> I have enabled remote login (ssh) on my Mac via System Preferences. But it doesn't work with keys and only works with normal user/pass authentication. I want to disable this behaviour and only allow public key (RSA or DSA) authentication.  I edited code/etc/sshd_config/code and uncommented following lines:  precodePasswordAuthentication no PermitEmptyPasswords no /code/pre  I then restarted the Remote Login service but it didn't help. It still allows password authentication and my keys are rejected.  Could anyone help me set this up?  <answer34094> Allow me to answer myself as I found a resolution.  If codePasswordAuthentication no/code doesn't work on its own (and I read in some situations it may) make sure to uncomment and set to "no" this:  precodeUsePAM no /code/pre  Kudos for this resolution go to Mac OS X Hints - http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20050815135941513&amp;lsrc=osxh.  <answer111388> On Mac OS X 10.8.5 (Mountain Lion) you also need to comment out the following line in /etc/sshd_config:  precode# The default is to check both .ssh/authorized_keys and .ssh/authorized_keys2 # but this is overridden so installations will only check .ssh/authorized_keys /code/pre  strong#AuthorizedKeysFile     .ssh/authorized_keys/strong  <comment38876> Please split of the second part (local network only) into a separate question, makes it easier for people to answer just one of them. <comment38878> Done - http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/34091/how-to-enable-remote-login-ssh-only-from-local-networks <comment38879> Where and how do you define your authorized keys? Key bases login works fine out of the box. <comment38880> @Gerry I have had my personal private/public keys generated for a while now. I used `cat id_rsa.pub  ~/.ssh/authorized_keys`, but no success. <comment38885> Did you fiddle with any other sshd settings before? A print out of your sshd_config file could be useful. If not, my guess is your public key is invalid, or does not match your private key, maybe you should try to generate a new key. <comment38888> @Gerry Thanks for help, answered myself. <comment279472> On OS X El Capitan 10.11.2 the file to edit is ``/private/etc/ssh/sshd_config``
