How to show which right and app is requesting elevated privilages (like in older versions of OS X)? <body> In older versions of OS X, when you got the prompt to enter an admin's password, you could see which right was being requested by which app. It seems they've moved that info from the authentication prompt. Is there a way I can see this again? It'd be great to know if the thing claiming to be a Java updater is what it says it is.  <comment170886> What version of OS X do you wish to enhance the privs dialogs? Mavericks?
