Mount combo (USB/COM) device <body> I've bought this simple navigator that works fine on PC using the software released by the company but there is no mac version for it. Under mac the navigator was supposed to be mounted as an external drive. But this doesn't happen.  I've left a question for the company support team, but it seems to be unlikely to get a proper answer. Is there any way to force it to mount as an external drive?  I'm using macbook pro running OS X Yosemite 10.10.2. When I plug in the device on USB, I can see this controller is up 'CP2102 USB to UART Bridge Controller' in the system details, but i have no idea what to do next.   <answer171489> Please try install this driver: https://www.pololu.com/file/download/48014_SiLabsUSBDriverDisk.zip?file_id=0J547  I have a amateur radio which uses a similar driver (CP210x USB to UART Bridge Controller) and I had to install it too...  EDIT:  Actually the driver is the same for CP210x and CP2102...  <comment201736> The second site you link to says `Connect your navi2coach to your computer... On a MAC a new device “navi2coach” will be recognized.` You have a **navi2move**. As these are different products, I assume that your device is simply not supported on the Mac. This is in congruence with the text on the [Functions page](http://www.o-synce.com/en/products/navigation-gps/navi2move.html) of your device, where the only supported OS is Windows. <comment201741> If you already installed this driver just tell me... <comment201743> No I didn't. So it sounds like I shouldn't should i? <comment201744> Yeah, I was wondering if there is any way to force mount... <comment201746> @MikeK Can you try? <comment201747> @MikeK When you install please unplug the device, in my case first time I installed, with device plugged in don't recognized and I had to reinstall... without plugged in... <comment201753> what is the difference with the one I already have installed with OS X?
