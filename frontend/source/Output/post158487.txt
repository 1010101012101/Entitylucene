How can I un-erase my iphone from iCloud <body> My iPhone was stolen and I made the mistake of choosing erase my iPhone in iCloud.br Is there any way to un-erase my iPhone from iCloud?    If not, is there any way to track my phone??  <answer158492> This is the link to the find feature in iCloud https://www.icloud.com/#find  Check out this forum https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4370979 (a user declared that it helped).     Sorry, there is no way for you to reverse the Erase command. AppleCare   "may" be able to, you can try calling them, but there is nothing you   can do.   <answer211335> Go to iColud.com and call Apple Care, they will walk you through how to get it back.
