More beautiful notes? <body> I would like to have an app that can use existing iCloud notes, but to show them in better way, using eg. simple markdown. So I can edit notes using the simple built-in application Notes or to use this beautiful notes. For example, i could add entries on my macbook using built-in notes app, but use something much nicer on my mobile devices.  I haven't found any such app. All applications are actually having their own storage and require to have both ios and osx clients.
