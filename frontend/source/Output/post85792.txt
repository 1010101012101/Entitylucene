Duplex Scanning in OSX with non-duplex scanner with document feeder <body> How can I scan a large double sided document with my scanner's document feeder? The scanner only can scan one side of the page. However, I am bulk scanning all my bills and tax forms and have several that are 10+ pages with text on both sides of the page.    Is there any stock software that will scan one side, prompt for you to flip the pages, scan the other side, and them output a single PDF file? Otherwise, I would need software to simply combine the two PDF files and properly order the pages.    <answer93788> PDF Scanner app on the app store claims to have 'fake duplex' scanning, which allows dual sided document scanning without a duplex scanner.    http://www.pdfscannerapp.com/  <answer282281> There is also a free alternative with PDFSAM, that perfectly work on Sierra 10.12.4.  You can separately scan first odd pages (beginning with the strongfirst page/strong) and then even pages (beginning from the stronglast page/strong). After that you can mix all together with the emalternate mix/em option taking care of reverse the even page, as the following image:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2nZ2r.png" alt="enter image description here"
