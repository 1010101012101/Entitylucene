Remove an email address from apple-ID <body> I have two Apple IDs:  ul liOne (lets say codeA/code) associated with my old email address (lets say codeold@xyz/code), which is the one I actually use/li liAnother one (lets say codeB/code) associated with my new email address (lets say codenew@xyz/code), which I created when I was in the US./li /ul  Now I want to associate codenew@xyz/code to the account codeA/code. However I'm not able because that mail is already used for the account codeB/code. I tried to change the primary email of the account codeB/code with codeanother_one@xyz/code, but then, when I try to change the primary mail of the account codeA/code with codenew@xyz/code it says that the mail address is already verified with another account (the B).  Is there a way for dissociating an email from an apple ID? In other words, how can I use codenew@xyz/code with the account codeA/code when the address is alraedy used for the account codeB/code?  <answer62482> You can’t remove the primary email address associated with the account. You can set another one as the primary, but the first email address that you use to create the account with cannot be changed ever. Not even by calling Apple. I tried. Eventually, I created a dummy gmail account to get my invoices and stuff. Once an email address is verified, there is no way to “unverify” it.
