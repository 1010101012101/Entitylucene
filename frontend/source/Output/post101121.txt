What's the /home directory for, or did I just accidentally create it? <body> I saw reference to a bash command, codecd /home/code, in a multiple choice quiz about navigating within Terminal. I tried it, expecting code-bash: cd: /home: No such file or directory/code, but to my surprise it took me to a top level directory /home. I don't know if it just created the directory or if it was already there, or if it's a temporary thing or what.  I've googled around for info on the hidden top level directories (/var, /usr, /private, /etc, ...) but none mention a /home directory. Using codels -al/code from / yields (omitting all but the relevant line):  precodedr-xr-xr-x   2 root  wheel        1 Sep  6 15:57 home /code/pre  and a codels -al/code from within /home yields  precodetotal 2 dr-xr-xr-x   2 root  wheel     1 Sep  6 15:57 . drwxr-xr-x  30 root  wheel  1088 Aug 17 17:17 .. /code/pre  I was surprised at how hard it was to track down a comprehensive (or even partial) directory tree showing what/where stuff is (beyond what shows up in Finder).  Can anyone help me out?  <comment119050> I did some research into what `/home` is for on OS X here: http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/87052/21050 (scroll down to my answer; it doesn't seem to jump there automatically) <comment119051> @zigg Thanks! It's good to know it's supposed to be there. I'd mark your comment as an answer if I could. <comment119068> Yeah, /home is there -- like it or not -- I actually don't like it being there.  I'll read up on the answer above.  I do want to mention that now I like to see all of the hiddent files and folders by issuing the following command: defaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE Once you issue this command, you can see all kinds of Unixy things in the Finder.
