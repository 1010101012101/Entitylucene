Installed rEFInd Boot Manager, it seems HD re-ogranized <body> Before I installed rEFInd, I believe there were three partitions to my Mac, disk0, disk1, disk2.   Now, when I run in the Command line  precode diskutil list /code/pre  This is what remains:   precode /dev/disk0     #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER     0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.1 GB   disk0     1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1     2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            499.2 GB   disk0s2     3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3 /code/pre  I'm not sure what to think of this. Previously code/dev/disk0s2/code was codeApple_CoreStorage/code of a size around 499 GB. Then there was a code/dev/disk1/code, which was "Apple_HFS Macintosh HD". Notice that's now disk0s2 above.   Should I worry? Thankfully I have everything saved on an external hard drive.  EDIT: If it helps, my HD used to look like the second screenshot on this web tutorial, after codediskutil list/code. http://www.theinstructional.com/guides/disk-management-from-the-command-line-part-1  <comment223470> That's a pretty standard GPT partition layout. Looks fine to me. <comment223471> @FakeName My only concern really is that "Apple_CoreStorage" seems to have disappeared. That's strange.
