With an Airport router how I can see which network a device is connected to <body> I am having an intermittent issue where a device connected wired with a cable and a device connected wirelessly cannot see each other. Sometimes they can and sometimes they cannot. I was thinking that perhaps when it doesn't work they are on different networks (2.4 and 5) and when it does work they are on the same network. But I cannot find a way to tell which they are on. With other routers I can find this out. Is there a way with the Airport to find out?
