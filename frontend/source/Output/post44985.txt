BF2 via CrossOver "@" problem <body> I've installed BF2 with CrossOver, and so far it's working. Now I like to play online but I can't login with my e-mail because of the "@"  Does anyone know how to type the "@"? Can't find it...  emstrongThanks/em/strong  <answer44989> It usually depends on your keyboard. It's kbdâ‡§ Shift/kbd+kbd2/kbd on US keyboards, and I suspect you might have to use that in Crossover as well.  Also keep in mind that Crossover has the ability to configure your modifier keys, so you might want to try some other modifiers with kbdL/kbd if that's what you normally do.  <comment51177> How do you normally type "@" and what happens when you try that? <comment51178> Does it prevent you from typing it in, or what? <comment51181> On Mac I normaly type ALT+L but nothing happened so I tried @ on Windows - nothing <comment51184> Thanks that worked. ALT+L don't work because I'm form Germany ;)
