How do you mount -bind a local directory? <body> In linux, one of the great things you could do (for developers, in particular) was to mount a folder and locally bind it to another folder on the system.  This had the advantage over symlinks due do the fact tools like Git didn't detect it as being a different type of node, and you didn't need to remove the original contents. When you were done, you could simple unmount and you were left with the original filesystem contents.  However, codemount -bind/code or codemount.local/code don't seem to exist on Mac (as of OS X 10.10.2, Yosemite).  How do you go about this?  <answer197030> As mentioned by another user on StackOverflow, you can use an NFS mount do to this. However, it requires a little bit of one-time setup.  First, you'll need to set up an code/etc/exports/code file (if you haven't done so already).  precode$ sudo tee -a /etc/exports &lt;&lt;&lt; "/ -alldirs -mapall=$USER localhost" /code/pre  Secondly, you'll need to start the rpc and nfsd services.  precode$ sudo launchctl start com.apple.rpcbind $ sudo nfsd start /code/pre  hr  From there, give NFSd a little bit to wake up and get breakfast, and you should be good to mount:  precode$ sudo mount localhost:/path/to/target ./mnt /code/pre  To restore the original contents, just do  precode$ sudo umount ./mnt /code/pre  <answer197078> There is another option - bindfs. It requires you to install FUSE but provides an alternative to using NFS.   You may need to compile from source but I see it's available in MacPorts too.  <comment280421> **Homebrew:** Install [osxfuse](https://osxfuse.github.io/), then `brew install homebrew/fuse/bindfs` (Tested on El Capitan; no need for `sudo` before `bindfs` for user-oriented mounts) <comment342701> I tried to mount my exfat usb drive `$ sudo mount localhost:/Volumes/Aren/Movies /Users/me/Movies/` <comment342702> `mount_nfs: can't mount /Volumes/Aren/Movies from localhost onto /Users/me/Movies: No such file or directory` <comment342703> Its working good If I do it the other way!
