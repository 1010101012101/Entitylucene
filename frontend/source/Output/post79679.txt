A true large image viewer for OS X? <body> Are there any image viewers out there that can navigate a truly massive (i.e. 500 megapixel/250MB) JPEG image? Everything but Preview has crashed for me.  Preview does OK, but doesn't have many features.  <answer79697> I'm not sure what your requirements are, Preview always does ok for me. However I heard that Xee is more powerful and some people prefers it.  <comment91986> Xee is the first one I tried, and it instantly ate up all available RAM and crashed.
