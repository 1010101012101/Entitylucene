Automatically backup JailBreak iPhone DCIM photo directory <body> Hi I heard that you can write cron job into plist and put it to JB iPhone /Library/LaunchDaemons folder in plist format  I would like to backup the photo folder every 300 seconds, so I put a com.backup.plist like this into /Library/LaunchDaemons folder  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;KeepAlive&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;true/&gt;      &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;com.backup&lt;/string&gt;      &lt;key&gt;Program&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;/bin/cp&lt;/string&gt;      &lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;array&gt;         &lt;string&gt;-u&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;string&gt;/private/var/mobile/Media/DCIM/100APPLE/*.*&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;string&gt;/private/var/backup&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;/array&gt;      &lt;key&gt;StartInterval&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;integer&gt;300&lt;/integer&gt;  &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  I have created a folder of /private/var/backup with access right of 777 mobile:mobile  I rebooted the iPhone, however, the script just doesn't work  Does the failure refer to the "cp" command access right? or should I change the /private/var/backup folder access right to something else?  btw I'm running iOS 4.3.3 Jailbreak iPhone 4   Many thanks for reading  <answer16171> According to Wikipedia's article on cp:     To copy a directory to a directory (-r or -R must be used)   So try adding code&lt;string&gt;-r&lt;/string&gt;/code to the list of arguments. Reboot your device and after 5 minutes (300 seconds) check if it worked.   Ad@m  <answer16204> From the codeman lanuchctl/code     Note that per-user configuration files   (LaunchAgents) must be owned by the   user loading them. All system-wide   daemons (LaunchDaemons) must be owned   by root. Configuration files must not   be group- or world-writable. These   restrictions are in place for security   reasons, as allowing writability to a   launchd configuration file allows one   to specify which executable will be   launched.   So,  precodechown root  /Library/LaunchDaemons/your.plist  chgrp wheel /Library/LaunchDaemons/your.plist  chmod 644   /Library/LaunchDaemons/your.plist /code/pre  and after these:  precodelaunchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/your.plist /code/pre  <comment17341> Do you get any error messages in the log files? <comment17516> where will the log file of launchdaemons be located? <comment17708> since running `code` cp -u /private/var/mobile/Media/DCIM/100APPLE/*.* /private/var/backup `code` directly in shell has no problem copying the files, so I believe the problem isn't about the argument of cp
