Is there a keyboard shortcut for the AC button on Yosemite calculator? <body> Is there a keyboard shortcut that will trigger the AC button on the OS X Yosemite calculator? Escape key triggers the Clear (C), but hitting escape again does NOT trigger the AC. Only a mouse click does.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/F3GKT.png" alt="Calculator AC button"  <answer170627> On a wired extended keyboard, it's the 'square with an X in it' above 7. kbd  ‚åß /kbd   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BZ42W.png" alt="enter image description here"  I don't know where it is on a laptop or short keyboard.  <answer170630> On my MacBook Pro, AC/All Clear can be achieved by strongfn/strong + strongesc/strong.
