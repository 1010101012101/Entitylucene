How to set a default Calendar in iCal 10.7.2 <body> Since I activated iCloud, iCal has changed the default calendar to new events to one which I do not want to use.  How can I change the default calendar for iCal? I cannot find a setting!  <answer27471> This is in iCal's preferences:  strongPreferences  General  Default Calendar/strong.  This enables the default calendar to be set.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XyNOf.png" alt="Default Calendar"
