Shortcut to insert / paste email address? <body> Is there a way to setup a shortcut to insert my email address when typing?  About once a day I need to type my email address on some login form or order page. It would be really nice to have a kind of paste function that inserts my email address.  Of course this is also a feature request: Long (context) tap while typing - cut/copy/paste/select menu pops up - in that menu I would like to have an additional item: "Insert email address". Even better: Allow me to define additional "paste items".  <answer288645> It seems the Clips app provides what you're looking for. It's basically a clipboard manager, which comes with a custom keyboard extension that lets you paste copied texts into text fields. It's a free app available in the App Store.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/usUWN.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer288647> Built in to the operating system is text replacements, so if you open Settings - General - Keyboard - Text Replacement you can add your own text replacement shortcuts. For example, you might add "e@" and have it expand to your full email address, such as "email@domain.com". It will automatically expand when tabbing away from a field or hitting the space key on your keyboard.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jcYJN.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment364518> I recommend using `@@` because there's no time when that comes up naturally; using something like `e@` may inadvertently replace text when typing something like `j.doe@domain.com`. <comment364519> @joanwolk Good point, however, in my (very limited) testing, I haven't managed to have it replace e@ unless I absolutely write it on its own. It's definitely an issue with some other text replacement apps though. <comment364593> Amazing, thank you very much! I just wish I'd known about this earlier.
