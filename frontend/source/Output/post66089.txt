Set the date and time in menubar to be in a specific format <body> I want the menubar to display the date and time in the menubar as follows:   precode2012-10-03 09.12.14 /code/pre  which translates into Year-Month-Day 24hr.min.second  strongWhat I've tried:/strong   Gone into System Preferences  Date &amp; Time  Clock  Selected: Digital; Display time with seconds; use 24-hour clock   This gets me close to having the time right.  Gone into System Preferences  Date &amp; Time  Date &amp; Time  Open Language &amp; Text  Formats  Dates  Customize  Changed every date format (short, medium, long, full) to have yyyy-MM-dd  Gone into System Preferences  Date &amp; Time  Date &amp; Time  Open Language &amp; Text  Formats  Times  Customize  Change every time format to kk.mm.ss  strongThe problem:/strong   It still shows the date like:   precode3 Oct 13:19:12 /code/pre  in the menubar.   strongDetails:/strong  I am running Mac OS X 10.7.5  Any help or suggestions you can give, much appreciated!  <answer66106> Whilst I'm not sure this is possible with the built-in menubar clock formats, you can acheive the format you require using the excellent iStat Menus ($16, but it does have a 14-day free trial).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JPNo5.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer66109> Are you aware that OS X uses multiple Formats for Date and Time (depending on where it is shown) and you must modify the right one? E.G. the timestamp in Finder has a different format than in the top right corner.  <answer145707> There is a free app called Day-O that is flexible and can do what is being asked:  https://shauninman.com/archive/2016/10/20/day_o_2_mac_menu_bar_clock  <answer285769> I know it's an old thread but in case anyone else is looking for alternatives, I recommend Itsycal. Absolutely FREE and customisable date/time with calendar view options  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FRnyI.jpg" alt="joined three screenshots of Itsycal"  <comment77759> Any idea which one? I've tried several combinations like the OP has and it only modifies the way the date/time is shown in the Finder, not the date/time displayed in the menubar <comment77778> I've modified all of them to be identical to what I want. The problem remains. <comment77781> mhm I even found this http://www.macyourself.com/2008/08/31/modify-the-default-clock-in-os-xs-menu-bar-to-show-the-full-date/ maybe it is a bug <comment77916> Well, that appears to do it, but I can't believe that the solution requires payment.
