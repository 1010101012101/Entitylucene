How to sync voice memos with itunes over air <body> How can I sync my voice memos on iphone with my macbook over air? It works with cable but I want to work over air. Is that possible?  <answer92365> If with "over the air" you mean iCloud I'm sorry but it's not possible. The only way is to use a third party application that use iCloud to store the memos, like this. Instead if you mean WiFi it is possible to do that using iTunes and the normal WiFi sync.
