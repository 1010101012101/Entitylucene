App restriction for Mac App Store, Java? <body> While I was reading the guideline of app restriction which is to be submitted to Mac App Store, in Wikipedia, the following point caught me,   ul liApps that use deprecated or optionally installed technologies. Examples given: Java/li /ul  This means you can't submit app/games written by Java. But this sounds ridiculous. Is there something I am missing of is it just like that? No Java App allowed on Mac App Store?  <comment39505> Welcome to Ask Different! Questions about programming, development, and listing your apps on the App Store are off topic for Ask Different.
