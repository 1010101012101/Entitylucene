Root being controlled by ARD <body> I run an educational lab of 20 iMacs, all running Mac OS 10.7.5(11G63) with ARD version 3.6.2. My server and all of the iMacs run Lion. I seem to have crossed something and now my root user is being controlled with the same preferences I have setup for my LDap users. Somehow, ARD has taken control of the root user, most notably the System Preferences. Is there a way around this problem. I need root to have full permissions (like it should), while still controlling the individual users who log on.
