Discoveryd & LaunchServicesd Huge Memory Consumption <body> I have been troubleshooting why my Mac Mini is running slow and stumbled upon this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/z7QiL.png" alt="enter image description here"  The memory usage is in the strongemGB/em/strong!    On my MacBook the two processes take under 10 MB together.  Why are these procs taking up so much memory, and how can I fix it to resemble usage on my MacBook?  strongMac Mini Server (Late 2012)/strong  ul liMem 4GB/li liOS X Yosemite 10.10.2/li /ul  <answer179273> This is a known issue in Yosemite, although it doesn't affect everyone - I have 5 Macs running Yosemite and one suffers badly, but the others not at all.  Temporary relief comes from rebooting or stopping and restarting the affected services. For discoveryd, in Terminal, do:  sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.discoveryd.plist  sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.discoveryd.plist  Launchervicesd may respond to the same commands - I don't have any experience of that  <comment212434> what happens when you kill them +restart ? <comment212502> "This is a known issue in Yosemite"  do you have a reference?  I would like to keep track of its status. <comment212503> @Buscarì›ƒ A restart provides *temporary* relief. <comment212534> Look in Parent processes and take a Sample (in Activity Monitor) that might show why. Also start in Safe mode to exclude 3d party apps doing that. <comment212625> There's some good info in this and related issues here:  [link](http://arstechnica.com/apple/2015/01/why-dns-in-os-x-10-10-is-broken-and-what-you-can-do-to-fix-it/)  It also comes up in some of the discussions about Yosemite WiFi issues.  I've raised BRs with Apple for my instances, and sent diagnostics, but haven't had anything back yet <comment213260> I have this same issue, but it only targets launchservicesd. If I can catch it quickly enough, unloading/loading the daemon helps (though something trips later and locks up the system, requiring a restart anyway). As the OP asks, is there any documentation *anywhere* about this issue? I've been looking for months with no luck. I've watched launchservicesd go from ~20 MB to 7 GB (and 20+ GB virtual mem!). <comment213475> I've never found any documentation as such  just the link I posted. You'll have seen that there's not a great deal coming up in a Google search either. I assume Apple is aware of, and working on, the issue.  I might regret saying this, but I just wiped and rebuilt the Mac that was having the problem and it hasn't recurred in the last 4 days. That makes me think that the cause is a conflict with an older OS X component that isn't properly cleared when updating to a new OS version.   The problem Mac is a server, and thus probably handling higher volumes of DNS traffic than a client Mac. <comment213476> Launchservicesd does different things, so there may be different issues here. One suggestion I saw was to rebuild the launch services database (Google for how to do it) - if you've already tried that, sorry <comment213588> @Nick Thanks for the insight in your last comment.  I started having the problem after upgrading to Yosemite.  I am also running Mac Server on it.  Will have to try a rebuild. <comment213850> @BAR - hope it works - let us know what happens
