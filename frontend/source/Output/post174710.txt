How to show hidden files in finder? <body> In terminal I ran:  codedefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE/code  and   codekillall Finder/code  If I kbdCMD/kbd + kbdSHIFT/kbd + kbdG/kbd  code/usr/local/.git/code I can see the folder.    However, if I kbdCMD/kbd + kbdSHIFT/kbd + kbdG/kbd and go to code/usr/local/code I cannot see the folder.  <answer174721> Shift-Command-Period shows and hides the files in open/save dialogs, it might work in the main Finder.  <answer174724> You have to let Finder know that you want a Boolean value (true or false):  precodedefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool TRUE /code/pre  <comment205757> kbd the key /kbd <comment205773> you mean /usr/local/git, without using the (.) so not the /usr/local/.git <comment205783> @Buscar웃 I'm using a (.).  The OP is correct as is.  Now if that's the correct way to do it I dunno :) <comment205785> normally system wont let you use a (.) in front of a folder or file name. You can’t use a name that begins with a dot “.”, because these names are reserved for the system. Please choose another name. <comment205787> This is not a folder I created.  It is a convention used by Git.  The particular folder is part of the [homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/share/doc/homebrew/Formula-Cookbook.md#formula-cookbook) project. <comment205789> This does not work for me. <comment205924> @bmike FWIW, this question points out an error on that SE page and some blogs on the internet.  `defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE` **does not work**.  The bool option is necessary. <comment205929> Indeed. That is why it wasn't merged or deleted, just linked. Your comment on the wrong answer is awesome. I'll link here from there as well.
