Use of iTunes gift card credit <body> I have a $50 iTunes gift card credit. How can I use it for the App Store? When I try to purchase an app from the App Store, I am asked to enter a credit card number.  Can I transfer the $50 to the App Store account?  <answer101567> I think this will work...  Open iTunes  Just below the volume bar is your Apple ID.   Click on that and select Redeem. It will prompt for your Gift Card info..
