Window management app on mac os x? <body> I currently use "Stay," and have tried other tools (haven't really loved any of them), but I am looking for a window management tool that does the following:  ol liStore my window locations/li liHave a separate profile for different monitor setups/li liAllow me to quickly modify the location with hotkeys/li liAutomatically load my default settings when I attach/detach a display/li /ol  Any help would be great!  <answer25358> I never used stay but I am using Moom (Apple store) and pretty happy with it. It stores windows positions and has configurable hotkeys. There is no automatic settings for different displays but since you can assign hotkeys to configuration is not a big issue.  It is very stable.  <answer29791> Moom  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vsVX9.png" alt="Moom"  Divvy  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GQMoH.png" alt="Divvy"  <answer29794> I prefer DoublePane. It's $2.99 on Mac App Store.  <comment17716> We've already had lots of window management questions. See [What Window Management Options Exist for OS X?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/9659/what-window-management-options-exist-for-os-x) and [Can I get Windows 7-like resizing on Mac OS X?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/557/can-i-get-windows-7-like-window-resizing-on-mac-os-x). <comment17718> Yeah, that is not what I am speaking off though. I guess my question is: Is there a more reliable app like "Stay" that I could get? <comment17719> I know, which is why I didn't close this question. <comment32395> Hands down, Moom is the best - and exactly what I was looking for. <comment34156> [What Window Management Options exist for OS X?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/9659/what-window-management-options-exist-for-os-x), [Tiling Window Manager for Mac OS X?](http://superuser.com/questions/162849/tiling-window-manager-for-mac-os-x), [multiple monitor software for Mac](http://superuser.com/questions/279036/muliple-monitor-software-for-mac), [Move windows around a desktop -- and to different desktops -- using only the keyboard?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/28286/move-windows-around-a-desktop-and-to-different-desktops-using-only-the-key) <comment34157> Some apps that allow resizing to custom bounds: [Breeze](http://www.autumnapps.com/breeze/), [Divvy](http://mizage.com/divvy), [SizeUp](http://irradiatedsoftware.com/sizeup/), [Moom](http://manytricks.com/moom/) <comment34158> There's a bunch of such tools listed in the answers [this question][1].      [1]: http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/29212/9058
