Check if newly released iOS app is worldwide available on the AppStore <body> I will release my iOS app soon and I read that there is a delay for up to 5 hours until the app is available on the AppStore worldwide. I'm in Austria (Europe), how can I check if the app is already available on the US AppStore? (or better yet if it's available everywhere)  <answer182650> I only know of a manual way checking it.  Open App Store and click at the flag circle bottom right.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/puNE0.jpg" alt="flag"  Now select the country you want to check for your app.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9cTeZ.jpg" alt="select country"  <comment217538> Wait a whole day before starting your ad campaign? <comment217546> There must be a better way to do this. <comment217551> Propagation is an eternal issue, especially if you're not in charge of the propagation method. Apple take their own sites offline for a period before an important release, so the 'switch on' can be simultaneous. The rest of us don't have that luxury ;)
