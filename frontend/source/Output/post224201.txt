Network, moving large folder : Photo Library <body> I want to move my Photo Library through my Synology NAS, I know I'm gonna lose the iCloud Syncing (which is very annoying...) but anyway.  Every time I trying to move the Photo Library (quite heavy, 125.85 GB I have this error "The operation can’t be completed because an unexpected error occurred (error code -50)."  I've tried with SMB, AFP, and I'm not trying with a basic terminal command  which probably gonna failed too.  precodesudo mv /Users/Kevin/Pictures/Photos\ Library.photoslibrary  /Volumes/photo/ /code/pre  All this is connected through an Asus RT-68U, which is suppose to be fast, but ... you know..   I only have 11 devices connected on the network at this time, most are in idle.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AFZc5.png" alt="Connected devices"  Ethernet are quite ok, and wifi is may be a bit high :  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KNhYK.png" alt="Ethernet"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VZD1k.png" alt="Wifi"  Edit: When exporting photo through the Photos.app export : img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GHdEN.png" alt="Export"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bHx6j.png" alt="NAS Network Settings"  <comment271874> Also, Just thinking, should I not jut export the photo from the photo.app file menu otherwise the pictures will be only available through the photo.app <comment271882> Does Console.app or the synology's log give you any other information? <comment271893> I didnt check the log, but terminal failed "mv: /Volumes/photo/Photos Library.photoslibrary/Photos Library.photoslibrary/Masters/2015/04/25/20150425-083443/IMG_2638.MOV: Invalid argument "   would the name be too long ?  Also, don't get it but file on NAS is now 128.37 GB when original folder is 125.85 GB, no sense. <comment271894> Update, as per the Synology log, its seems that even if only moving the file per AFP, its converting the files : "2016-01-20 14:17:22 Error DiskStation user System System failed to convert video [/volume2/photo/Photos Library.photoslibrary/Masters/2014/06/07/20140607-131519/IMG_2183.MP4] to mp..." so that probably why <comment272109> Kevin—the files would be much more accessible if exported. The .photoslibrary "file" is actually a special folder. That the size is different on the NAS is likely due to the use of a different file system. I'm not familiar with the inner workings of Synology, but I did notice that you are referencing two different files in the two log entries. Can you find a log entry on each device that deals with the same file? <comment272239> hi @samh, I expected to be the file system too, I actually forgot the idea to move the folder, instead I'm exporting from the photos.app, but this is failing too : http://i.stack.imgur.com/GHdEN.png maybe I should just change the network settings of my NAS   http://i.stack.imgur.com/bHx6j.png
