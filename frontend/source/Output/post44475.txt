Access Applications directory in Terminal <body> I'm really new to command line and I'm trying to access my Applications directory within Terminal.   By default, I am stuck in my user directory but Applications is a child of the "Macintosh HD".   Any tips on how to get to this directory as opposed to usernameApplications?  <answer44479> In the Terminal you can type the emabsolute path/em...  precodecd /Applications /code/pre  to access applications installed for all users.  If you want to access the root folder (named "Macintosh HD", in your case), it called code//code in Mac OS X (and other UNIX variants).  And codecd/code, meaning bc/bhange bd/birectory, is used to navigate.  hr  Alternatively, you can use the shortcut kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbd&#x21E7;/kbd+kbdG/kbd in the Finder and type...  precode/Applications /code/pre  You do not need to type out the whole name. Tab-completion automatically adds the last letters. You can invoke tab-completion by pressing kbd&#x21E5;/kbd while typing code/Applications/code.  <answer44484> In terminal type:  precodecd / cd Applications /code/pre  Or you can just type:  precodecd /Applications /code/pre  At this point, if you type codepwd/code em(print working directory)/em it should return code/Applications/code  A great place to start with Terminal is http://linuxcommand.org/learning_the_shell.php even though it is aimed at Linux users  <answer44485> To navigate using the terminal you will use 2 commands; codecd/code and codels/code.  To change directory you use codecd/code. Ex: codecd myfolder/anotherFolder/code.  You can type codepwd/code to display the current directory you are in.  To list the content of a directory use codels/code. You can get more info about the content of a directory using codels -al/code.   You will notice that here are 2 directories which are always present wherever you list the content of a directory: code./code and code../code.  code./code is simply a reference to the current directory so typing codecd ./somedir/code and codecd somedir/code are equivalent.  code../code is a reference to the parent directory. So using codecd ../code will move you back to the parent directory.  There are 2 ways to navigate. Either by using the full path or by using the relative path.  Let's say you are in code/Users/user20378/code. If you want to get to /Applications you can either navigate there using the full path codecd /Application/code or the relative path codecd ../../Applications/code.  Depending on where you want to navigate the relative path can be more or less efficient than the full path.  Use tab while typing the name of a folder or a file to auto complete.  <comment50551> You can also drag the applications folder from the Finder into the Terminal window which will automatically insert the path. <comment50552> @jaberg Yeah, but only in Lion, right? <comment50553> It goes back way before Lion, but I can't remember exactly when that feature was added. 10.4? <comment50628> I would split these up into paragraphs for each idea. <comment50629> A great tutorial is http://linuxcommand.org/learning_the_shell.php. It's what I learned the shell on, and I enjoyed it thoroughly.
