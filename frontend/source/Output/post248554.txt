My entire music collection is gone from Finder <body> I do not use iTunes but instead store my music files in nested folders in code/Users/User/Music/code. I recently downloaded Tomahawk, a music player.   I decided quickly that I preferred to stick with VLC for playing music, only to find that I can no longer use VLC as all my files are removed from my music folder. I restarted, and some of the files appear in Tomahawk program while other are gone. It seems unlikely (and would be very unfortunate) if the files have been totally deleted; I imagine they are hidden somewhere on my computer. Where can I find them, and/or is it possible to reset my system to a few hours ago or restore them in some other way?  Note: it is not the entire folder that has been removed. The folder structure (subfolders for each artist, etc.) remains, and other files, like images of the album covers in .jpg format, remain.  <answer248581> It seems unlikely it would delete them, but I don't know how that app works at all...br ...so, assuming Tomahawk has moved the files to its own cache/storage location, you could try using something like EasyFind (freeware) - which can search hidden locations far more easily than Spotlight - to look for either Folders containing the name Tomahawk, or one or two actual music file names.    Chances are, you find one, you've found them all.  Without Time Machine as a quick revert, moving them back to their original locations may not be so simple - it might be a case of dragging each one back to its correct folder, one at a time.  <comment307993> Alternatively, can I see which files have been moved and where to, in the last *timeframe* via the command line? I don't mind restoring the files manually. <comment307996> Do you use Time Machine? <comment307997> No, unfortunately. Is there a way I can get a list of which files over 3Mb were moved in the last two hours, say, and use that to find out where my files are? <comment307998> Can you check the logs in Console?
