Mac Terminal PATH settings <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   Reset your PATH variable       Everytime I open Terminal I need to set the PATH using:  PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11/bin  Otherwise commands like 'ls' do not work. This is a pain. How do you fix the PATH so that each time you open the Terminal you don't need to set the PATH?  <answer62365> You can do this by editing the code.profile/code file in your home directory - just add your PATH command into there and it will be executed each time you open a Terminal window.  You can read about some other ways to do this in this question.  <answer62366> One good way is to set your environment variables in code/etc/launchd.conf/code, as shown here. Putting them in launchd.conf makes them accessible in the terminal as well as in any code you may write which uses the environment settings.  <comment72043> If you need to do this every time, something is broken.
