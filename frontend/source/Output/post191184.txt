MacBook Pro clicking wont work! <body> I have a 2011 13" MacBook Pro. It has had no problems up until now. Suddenly, clicking won't work! I thought that it was the touchpad that wasn't working right, but then I connected a mouse and the problem still persists! Sometimes it doesn't want to click, and other times it won't stop clicking. I have gone online and tried everything that people have recommended but nothing works!   <answer191191> To restore some functionality, go to System Preferences  Trackpad, and tick the box next to "Tap to click".  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/R7dQJ.png" alt="enter image description here"  It's possible this is a software or driver issue. However:  If the trackpad does not depress with a "click-clack" noise when you push the lower left or right corner, it's possible you have a hardware issue: Something is preventing it from moving internally. On a 2011 MacBook Pro this can be caused by:  • Battery swelling • Improperly adjusted Trackpad screw (movement over time can cause the screw to rotate) • Trackpad hardware failure  To diagnose the cause, inspect the bottom case of your MacBook Pro. Is the case swollen under the trackpad, either visibly or by touch? If so, your battery should be replaced immediately.   If the trackpad doesn't depress when pushed, it's most likely a stuck trackpad (screw adjustment) or a trackpad hardware failure.  Repairing Disk Permissions can sometimes solve input issues.   Go to Applications  Utilities  launch Disk Utility. From the First Aid tab, select your Hard Drive in the left field, then click the Verify Disk Permissions button. If you find errors, you will need to restart to repair them.   Restart while holding down CMD + R, select Disk Utilities from the menu (if you aren't there already), select your Hard Drive from the left hand field, and then click Repair Disk Permissions.   You can also try resetting the System Management Controller (SMC), by using the procedure here:   (From Link Below): • Portable Macs with non-removable batteries: Make sure the Mac is plugged in to AC power. On the built-in keyboard, press and hold the Shift, Option, and Control keys on the left side and press the power button. Release all the keys at once, and then turn the Mac on normally.  • Portable Macs with removable batteries: Disconnect the AC power cord and remove the battery. Press the power button, hold it for 5 seconds, and then let go. Put the battery back in, reconnect the power cord, and turn the Mac on normally.  http://www.macworld.com/article/2881177/how-to-reset-your-macs-nvram-pram-and-smc.html  <answer284306> You can also try resetting the System Management Controller (SMC), by using the procedure here:  (From http://www.macworld.com/article/2881177/how-to-reset-your-macs-nvram-pram-and-smc.html)   strongPortable Macs with non-removable batteries:/strong   ol liMake sure the Mac is plugged in to AC power. /li liOn the built-in keyboard, press and hold the kbdShift/kbd kbdOption/kbd and kbdControl/kbd keys on the left side and then press the power button. /li liRelease all the keys at once, and then turn the Mac on normally./li /ol  strongPortable Macs with removable batteries:/strong   ol liDisconnect the AC power cord and remove the battery. /li liPress and hold the power button down for 5 seconds/li liPut the battery back in/li liReconnect the power cord, and turn the Mac on normally./li /ol  strongemThe above procedure worked for me/em/strong  <comment227076> You may want to include links to solutions you've tried. <comment227095> The touchpad clicks and makes the sound that you say, and because it also doesnt work wirh any mouse i plug in, i dont think its a problem with thw hardware. i also already tried the option you suggested. :/ <comment227096> To be sure it's not a hardware issue, you could disable the trackpad while you have an a external mouse connected.

Around the same time, my mac warned me that the battery required a service.  Fixed the issue by replacing the battery with a 3rd party one from eBay - problem solved.
