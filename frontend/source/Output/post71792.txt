MacBook Pro Not Booting Up <body> My client's Mac Book Pro is not starting.  He wants me to check it out - and the immediate signs are as follows:  When on button is pressed lightly (not held) - Mac does nothing - this is normal as far as I can tell.  When on button is held down, the Mac seems to start to turn on - I hear the fan, and the little "Joot-joot" sound.  Whenever I then let go of the button, immediately the Mac dies.   If I keep the button held down, the Mac continues for about 5-15 seconds, a white light on the front panel lights up, and then after a short bit, the Mac dies.  What can cause this? I believe I tried to reset the SMC, but I'm not sure how well I did. I took out the battery, disconnected from power, and pressed the button for more than 5 seconds.  What could this be? How can I proceed to troubleshoot this?  Note, screen does not turn on during any of this.  No logo, no nothing.
