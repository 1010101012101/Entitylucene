For example, is there a way to add my own business to the map so everyone can find it?

If this is not possible, can I do the same thing just for me and share it with friends?  strongUpdate/strong  When I look at the attribution acknowledgements for that app I see that data is coming from overwhelmingly many sources.

The actual business data (location, adress, phone numbers etc.) doesn't seem to come from Yelp.
