Restart Screen Sharing Service on Mac mini Server <body> I'm running Mac OS X (emthink/em it's Snow Leopard - 10.6.7) on a Mac mini. I'm trying to connect remotely from an iMac (this has been working fine in the past, for some time). When I click "Share Screen..." in finder on the iMac, I (eventually) see the server's desktop, but it appears to be frozen. However, I've managed to determine (from closing the window and sharing screen again, on repeat) that it IS actually receiving input, just not updating the display.  I can ssh into the server, but how can I restart the screen sharing service?  <answer43767> OK, managed to find the answer (or, at least, eman/em answer; I'm not quite sure on all the details of this command):  precode$ sudo /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ARDAgent.app/Contents/Resources/kickstart -activate -configure -access -on -users admin -privs -all -restart -agent -menu /code/pre  As always - be careful when you paste something into terminal - best to inspect the command before running it. Doubly so when sudo is involved.  <answer43796> Rather than restart just the screen sharing service, I would suggest remote restarting the Mac Mini. You can do this via SSH by typing in:  h1codesudo shutdown -r now/code/h1  This will not only restart the screen sharing service, but may also resolve the issue that caused it to act up in the first place.  <answer43798> I had the same trouble, and to a headless Mini also. This is what I found that workedâ€¦  precodesudo launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.screensharing.plist   sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.screensharing.plist /code/pre  I had the opportunity to install an SSD in my Mini, and did a clean install of Lion at that time, and the issue persisted.  I made an alias  precodealias fixscreen='sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.screensharing.plist &amp;&amp;  sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.screensharing.plist' /code/pre  <answer258833> Using codelaunchctl unload/code and codelaunchctl load/code still works but the commands are now "legacy commands".  Here's a more recent approach that also works with a single command:  precodesudo launchctl kill KILL system/com.apple.screensharing /code/pre  This instructs launchctl to kill the screensharing service and then launchctl automatically restarts it after it has exited.  <comment77291> I'm not clear about the relationship between ARDAgent (ie remote management) and just screen sharing. The the UI, you can tick Screen Sharing and NOT Remote Management but kickstarting ARDAgent remotely ticks Remote Management and NOT Screen Sharing (although it enables VNC). Does that make sense? <comment181616> Thanks for this solution, was looking for it already for years! <comment259546> Of course, you need ssh enabled on the server. <comment323660> Does that work on Snow Leopard, as the question asks about? <comment339212> No, it doesn't work in Snow Leopard: "Unknown subcommand 'kill'"!
