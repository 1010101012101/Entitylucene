iTunes: show ALL artists <body> The artist list displays all artists that appear on at least one non-compilation album. Is there a preference somewhere to change that to display emall/em artists, i.e. including those that only appear on a compilation?  <answer80959> You can't do that in Artists view. The only way to do that is to show the Column Browser (View  Column Browser  Show Column Browser, or Command-B). Unfortunately, in iTunes 11, the column browser is only available in Songs view, or when you're viewing a playlist. But it will show all the artists, even those in compilations, as long as you choose View  Column Browser and uncheck Group Compilations.  iTunes 10 was much better for using the Column Browser, alas.  <comment163515> and earlier versions were even better
