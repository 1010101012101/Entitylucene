How to type foreign currency symbols on iOS? <body> Is there a way to type special unicode characters, or more specifically foreign currency sumbols, on an iPhone or iPad?  I mean symbols like ¥ (Yen), ฿ (Bitcoin or Thai Baht), ₩ (Korean Won) etc.  I'm just using a normal english iOS 9. How can I type those e.g. when writing an email or Telegram message or when submitting info on a website?  <answer225763> You get all the currency symbols except the Baht for free on the US keyboard.  Press and hold the $ symbol and you'll see all the alternates.  To get the Baht symbol - add the thai keyboard and the Baht symbol will be added to the US keyboard. You don't need to switch to that keyboard - just add it. Similarly, you can use this answer to make shortcuts if you please for often used symbols if changing a keyboard is too long for your needs.  ul liHow can I insert symbols on iPad or iPhone?/li /ul  <comment273972> I'm going to close this as a duplicate - but if you need help locating one specific item - please edit and @ping me and we can see about reversing the close/hold. <comment274026> @bmike yes, in this case I'm actually curious about these specific symbols: ฿, ₩, and the letter ł ("L with stroke") for the Polish Zloty symbol "zł". <comment274036> The Zloty is on the polish keyboard. I'll answer for all the currencies.
