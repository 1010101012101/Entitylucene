Error while installing Homebrew on Mac OS X (10.10.3): Unable to change file mode on /usr/local/ <body> When I run the command on the home brew website,  precode/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" /code/pre  I get:  precode==&gt; This script will install: /usr/local/bin/brew /usr/local/Library/... /usr/local/share/doc/homebrew /usr/local/share/man/man1/brew.1 /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions/_brew /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/brew ==&gt; The following directories will be made group writable: /usr/local/. ==&gt; The following directories will have their owner set to 17oei: /usr/local/. ==&gt; The following directories will have their group set to admin: /usr/local/.  Press RETURN to continue or any other key to abort ==&gt; /usr/bin/sudo /bin/chmod g+rwx /usr/local/. chmod: Unable to change file mode on /usr/local/.: Operation not permitted Failed during: /usr/bin/sudo /bin/chmod g+rwx /usr/local/. /code/pre  However, I see no reason for this, as I am an admin on my computer.  <answer238199> From your codels/code output:  codedrwxr-xr-x     5 root  wheel  uchg   170 Aug 20  2015 local/code  That codeuchg/code flag means the file or directory cannot be changed. You can remove it with this command: codesudo chflags -R nouchg /usr/local/code  For more information about file flags, see the man page for codechflags/code: http://ss64.com/osx/chflags.html  <comment288832> Is it asking for a password? The command tries to change /usr/local permissions so that it has read, write and run permission by the group. Could you run a list command `ls -la` on /usr and tell us what attributes the /usr/local folder has? <comment288834> Yes, it asks for a password (and I typed it in). /usr/local has `drwxr-xr-x     5 root  wheel    170 Aug 20  2015` <comment288860> Are you sure you are not running El Capitan? Also, are you logged in as an admin user? What happens if you run `sudo /bin/chmod g+rwx /usr/local` directly in Terminal? <comment288865> Yes I am quite sure, when I look at the "About this Mac" screen, it says: OS X Yosemite: 10.10.3 . If I run that myself (logged in as an admin user), I get the same error: `chmod: Unable to change file mode on /usr/local: Operation not permitted` <comment291882> El Capitan shouldn't matter anyway, since SIP doesn't protext /usr/local/ (c.f. https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204899) <comment291883> Can you run `ls -lOe /usr/` and paste the output here? <comment291958> @JayThompson http://pastebin.com/B5gwtBvu It was too long to paste into a comment.
