Does my Macbook Pro support 5 GHz Wi-Fi? <body> I have MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Early 2013). Does it support 5 GHz Wi-Fi?   I found the following details about Wi-Fi module there:  precodeBroadcom BCM43xx 1.0  802.11 a/b/g/n /code/pre  If 5 GHz are supported, then will it work with 2.4 GHz in parallel?  <answer175064> Yes, your MacBook Pro supports 2.4 GHz &amp; 5 GHz but not simultaneously. All Macs manufactured since 2007 with integrated Wi-fi support 802.11 a/b/g/n and and some 2006 Macs support 802.11 a/b/g.  Only AirPort Base Station and Time Capsules released in March 2009 or later can operate simultaneously over both bands.  Source  <comment206278> Thanks! How do you know that? And, I've changed Mhz to GHz ;). <comment206281> Thanks again. What is about 5 GHz support? How do you know that for sure? Looks like I can check Broadcom's site, but what should I look for? What should be instead of `xx` in the chip model `BCM43xx`? <comment206282> What do you mean by "in parallel"? Do you want to connect to two different WiFi networks at once (one on 2.4, one on 5)? <comment206284> @LA_ I don't understand you first question in your comment? Did you mean 2.4 GHz? <comment206286> Ah, sorry, looks like I've missed the first link. I.e. I was talking about 5 GHz, but didn't see the first link. <comment206287> @patrix, no, I want to be connected to the same network (to the same router), but thru 2 channels at the same time.
