Airdrop did not copy complete file <body> I have been using airdrop to transfere a ~100GB Aperture library from one Mac to another. After ~10h of copying, the file on the destination Mac was only 20GB of size. I was able to open the Aperture library, but a lot of master files were missing.  The strange thing is Activity Monitor showed that all ~100GB of data were transfered, but at some point the files just got lost.  Any ideas what may have gone wrong?  <comment77397> AirDrop is not the recommended way of transferring 100GB. It does so at speeds of max 10MB/s. <comment77399> I unfortunately had no other option at the time. As said in the question, it took about 10 hours. Even more it is frustrating that the file was not copied correctly. <comment77406> It will never copy correctly. AirDrop is just not that reliable or fast. Theoretically, it would take about 20 hours to copy that file.
