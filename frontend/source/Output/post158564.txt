Reduce the minimum iPhone volume (bluetooth speakers) <body> When connecting my iPhone (4S or 6) to a JBL Flip 2 bluetooth speakers, the minimum volume is too loud. Under that, it mutes. It is not a problem of the speakers, as the volume using another, non-Apple, phone, can be reduced much more.  Is there a way to get finer decrements of the volume than those of the side buttons? Moving the slider suggests so, but it is difficult to control in such small space.   I tried using a volume cap as suggested elsewehere, but there seems to have no effect on the volume precision.   Any ideas?  <answer179894> Slide up the Control Center. There you'll have a slider to control volume which allows stepless adjusting.  <comment186428> AFIK there is no way using iPhone controls to make them more fine resolution. Using the buid in Volume on the speaker is the only option to control the low and high range. If it is to loud at minimum input then reduce the volume on the speakers. <comment186429> @Buscarì›ƒ the volume control in the speaker just modify the iphone own settings, with the same precision. <comment216849> I am having the same problem and am considering returning the speaker as this does not happen with my Bose Bluetooth speaker.
