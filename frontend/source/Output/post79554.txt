Is it possible to remove Emergency call feature on the lock screen? <body> Is it possible to remove this feature? It's really annoying when you miss-click on it. Since my iPhone lags a lot this happens too often.   ul liiOS version: 4.2.1/li liiPhone: 3G/li /ul  <answer79557> Unfortunately there is no way to do this in native iOS (without a jailbreak).  The emergency call option is available with both the simple and complex passcode.   I assume the goal is that it would allow anyone to make an emergency call even if they don't know or forgot the passcode, and as a result could be an important safety feature.  The only way to disable it is to turn off the passcode - something with obvious undesirable effects.  <comment91850> I don't want anyone to be able to use my iPhone, since it's my phone. if you are able to make emergency phone calls, people could do it as a prank. <comment91853> @Alvar, Yes. Agreed. However, I'm guessing it also goes with the fact that all cell phones are supposed to be able to perform an emergency call - regardless of the current standing with the carrier. While I see what you are saying about playing a prank, I probably have other issues if someone has my iPhone that would play a prank like that. And, second, I know if I need to make an emergency call, chances are I want access to that very quickly. Just my 2Â¢.
