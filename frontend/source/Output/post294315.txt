What is the "Work" key in an exported iTunes (v12.6) library XML file? Why does iTunes keep re-syncing the same songs over and over? <body> It all started when I found iTunes is constantly re-syncing 715 songs; it appears to be the same 715 songs, too (hard to tell by just watching the sync process).  I've found on the internet that one possible cause is that certain song information might vary within a single album, thus causing iTunes to always think the track has been changed.  In order to check this I exported the library to an XML to analyze what might be varying.  I have found that just 715 tracks (out of about 5500 total) have a "Work" key in the XML. The value is always "Oldies."  I can't say for sure that these are the same 715 that always re-sync.  But it's enough of a coincidence to dig further.  strong17Aug17 update/strong:  I think I've proven that the Work field is the culprit.  I realized that all 1924 tracks were MP3 files.  Each file had the value "Oldies" in the "Group description" MP3 tag (this tag is also known as TIT1 and/or CONTENTGROUP).  It seems to be a known issue with later iTunes versions that this tag is related to the re-syncing issue (it's a selectable column in iTunes).

I noted the contents of the Work field (when not null) always matched the Grouping field (but not vice versa).  On a hunch, I went into iTunes and cleared the Grouping field on my entire library, which affected 1924 tracks.  On the next, and now all subsequent, sync sessions with my device, 1924 tracks are constantly re-syncing.  I exported the library again and, lo and behold, there are now 1924 tracks with a Work key set to "Oldies".  <comment371507> Interesting. Want to put up a snippet of the xml or is it too unweildy to assist.
