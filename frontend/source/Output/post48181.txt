Vibrating Bluetooth Bracelet/Watch <body> I'm looking for a device in the form of a bracelet/watch that vibrates when I receive calls and text messages; any recommendations?  <answer49072> Have you looked into the Pebble watch? The company already ships an android/blackberry model and the iPhone version is getting prodigious funding but isn't expected to ship until September 2012.  <answer159531> Vybe does this. It's not very nice looking. http://wearvybe.com  <comment55210> If jawbone UP were more reliable, I'd say ask them to make such a device, but it's not. I don't think Apple's notification center is up for the fast - so you'd be in a jailbreak situation to hack the notification stream even once you have a device that would be willing to receive the "vibrate now" command.
