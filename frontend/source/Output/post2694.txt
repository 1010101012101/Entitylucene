Can I update my 4.0b iphone to 4.0.1, and not to 4.1? <body> I am looking for a way to update my iPhone 3Gs to 4.0.1, and not to 4.1 so that I can jailbreak.  Can anyone help?  EDIT - I have now tried, and failed on two seperate machnines  to restore from DFU mode to 4.0.1 The device is has 4 beta on it.  <answer2695> You can go to this website and download the correct firmware file to your computer. From there, plug your iPhone into your computer and codeshift-click/code (Windows) or codeoption-click/code (Mac) the "Restore" button. From there, choose the firmware file your downloaded.  <answer2703> You can view information on jailbreaking iOS devices at Jailbreak Matrix and they include links to past firmware  <comment2388> Keep getting "the device isn't eligible for the requested build" <comment2408> Hmm, perhaps this website doesn't have the correct firmware. Have you tried choosing "iPhone 4" under "Download iOS 4.0.1 via direct links here:"? If you have, have you tried the dropdown list? If you can somehow get the firmware elsewhere, the instructions will still apply. (Maybe try the link in Jon Erickson's answer?)
