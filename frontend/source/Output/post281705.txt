How to change file icon based file's extension (.txt, .cpp, .docx, etc) <body> h1Desired result:/h1  All .py files show a nice Python icon, regardless of what default program they opened with. (Same for .cpp files, .txt files, etc)  _  h1How it currently works:/h1  Files (ex: .py files) are associated with their default program (in my case, Sublime text editor). The program (Sublime) then gets to choose what icon to show. It is possible to manually edit the program's (Sublime's) code to change the icons.  Details:  https://superuser.com/questions/178316/how-to-set-an-icon-for-a-file-type-on-mac  (I have done this with Sublime)   _  h1Why this result is not enough:/h1  strongI recently switched to the Atom text editor which broke all the icons I had setup in Sublime./strong In addition, I can't change the icons for Atom like I did in Sublime. The Atom editor's plist file and resources folder is not setup like Sublime. (It is still possible, but rather than renaming/replacing things, Atom actually requires additional code to be written/modified, and I don't have the skill/knowledge to just write the necessary code, and I cannot find any tutorial for learning how)   I (and I believe many others) would prefer that the file icon was set independently from what the default program is. (I mean an Excel file should look like an Excel file whether or not I open it with Microsoft Excel, Numbers, or Sublime)  _  h1Possible solution:/h1  It might be possible to fix this with an opener-app. If an opener-app is made the default opener for all file extensions, it would be able to set the icon for all those extensions. Then when the opener-app opens a file (for example .py file) it could then open that file with another program (for example Sublime). This way the default program could be changed through the opener-app, (for example, changing  the opener-app to have all .py files open the Atom Editor) but, because the opener-app is still technically the default, all the file-icons remain unchanged.  _  h1Question:/h1  Does anyone know of an app that does this already?   (If you know of any resources on how to create an app like this, I'd be happy to use them to make the app myself, and post the answer here)  <answer282010> I was able to create an app for exactly what I was talking about using AppleScript and simply copying most of the Sublime support files.  h2Setup For yourself/h2  I would not recommend downloading ANYONE's custom-made-easily-could-have-a-virus app. However, I will leave this here for people to look at. Hopefully in the future I'll make this an app on the App Store but that might take awhile. In the meantime, I'd recommend reading the code to make sure it's not malicious.  Download = https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bz6cPkDulveZdGh2UnlVdU0zbjA  Open strongscript editor/strong (a built-in Mac app)  Choose strongFile/strong - strongOpen/strong - emwhere ever you downloaded the app/em   You will then be viewing the grand total of 5 lines of code I wrote. Change "Atom" to whatever app you want to be your default.  Save the file (strongcommand/strong + strongs/strong).  Move the app to your applications folder.  Find a file you want to change the icon of (lets say a text file). Click the file once (highlight it), press strongcommand/strong + strongi/strong, go to the strongopen with/strong section. Choose strongDefaultOpener/strong from the list, then click strongchange all/strong.  You will probably have to reboot and toggle the strongshow icon preview/strong button (found in strongFinder/strong's strongView Options/strong) a few times for the icons to refresh and get replaced.   I have a few default icons already loaded up ( Text files, cpp files, bash/shell files, python, and about 7 others), but if you want to add your own:  ul liOpen your applications folder /li liRight click on strongDefaultOpener/strong /li liChoose strongshow package content/strong/li liThen open the strongcontent/strong folder /li liThen open the strongresources/strong folder /li liThen replace whatever icon with your own icon!  (Note your replacement icon will need to be a .icns file) /li liRestart and toggle the strongshow icon preview/strong button a few times /li /ul  90% of all those other folders and things are support files that were just straight up copied out of the Sublime Text 3 app. You can even open most them and see sublime's name all in them. (There's no actual Sublime app or packages in there, just the basic support files that almost all apps have). (I did this because I still don't really know how the icons are actually set.)  Like I said hopefully I'll be able to turn this in to a legitimate app one day instead of just a thrown together hack. If/When I do I'll post an update here. And if for some reason you want to help me, please do post a comment (I could use all the programming advice I can get).  <comment354495> What version of OS X/macOS are you using? <comment355019> OS X Sierra, 10.12.4 <comment355032> I do not believe Sublime HQ Pty Ltd, would appreciate you redistributing their copyrighted intellectual property, packaged in your app! <comment355179> You're right, and if I get any complains I will certainly take it down. I love the Sublime editor and wouldn't want to do anything that would reduce it's value. That said the files I have included are not unique to Sublime, in fact every Mac app that can open a file has nearly identical files. It just happens that I had already modified the Sublime files. There is also no mention of copy right inside any of the files I included (and there is mention of copy right other Sublime files).
