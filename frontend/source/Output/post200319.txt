Set two-arrow key combinations to [PageUp|PageDn|Home|End] <body> I have a new mac and am unable to recall how to enable the following key mappings:  ul liUp-Right - Page Up/li liDown-Right - Page Dn/li liUp -Left - Home/li liDown-Left - End/li /ul  Those combinations are strongworking on my other macbook/strong. I can not however recall where/how those are enabled. I have looked in the following and not found them:  ul liKarabiner (aka codeKeyRemap4Mac/code)/li liSystem Preferences | Keyboard  (looked through all the panels and clicked all the buttons)/li /ul  My recollection is there were a emsingle/em option selected that enabled all emfour/em of those mappings.  I did think it were in codeKarabiner/code (aka codeKeyRemap4Mac/code)  but can not find it .  <answer200735> OK found it - and yes it is Karabiner but not in the expected place instead under "Simulataneous key presses"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HRnIy.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  There is a similar way by using the Right-Option key:     Change Option-R Key   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RPxQg.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment241375> if you're on a 'short' keyboard [laptop, iMac etc], Fn + arrow keys do that <comment241399> @Tetsujin  Yes, using Fn-Arrow does work - but that is not convenient. I am referring to *just* the two-arrow combinations.
