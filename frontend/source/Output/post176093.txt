Does iCloud storage includes photos and videos? <body> Wikipedia says it doesn't.  However, iCloud it self say it does     Your photos and videos are using 1.1 GB      If you want to stop using iCloud Photos   Wikipedia said:     While Photo Stream uses the iCloud servers, usage does not come out of   the user's iCloud storage allowance   Okay looks like there need to be some form of explanation  <answer176099> Yes - this aspect could potentially be a little confusing. There strongis/strong a difference between emiCloud Photo Library/em and emPhotoStream/em and backed up photos and videos.  h2Photostream/h2  ul liDoes not count towards your iCloud storage limit./li liContains up to 1000 pictures (and only pictures)./li liAlso, shared photo streams (now called Shared iCloud Photos) do not count towards your limit./li liPhotoStream has been around for awhile and is quite automatic. It uploads just photos and allows you to view those photos on your iPad or computer./li /ul  h2iCloud Photo Library/h2  ul liCounts towards your iCloud storage limit./li liIs in beta (as of March 2015)/li liMust be manually enabled (and can sort of be disabled in Settings - Photos &amp; Camera - iCloud Photo Library (Beta))./li liUploads your ementire/em photo and video library from your phone./li liHas some fancy-ness built in like optimizing your iOS device's storage./li liCan be viewed on your iPad, iPhone, computer, and iCloud.com/li liIs terrible at this point (IMO, March 2015)/li /ul  h2Backed Up Photos/h2  ul liAre managed in Settings - iCloud - Storage - Manage Storage/li liTypically they will then be under [Your iPhone Name]'s iPhone - Photo Library, but if Photo Library is enabled you will see information on iCloud Photo Library./li /ul  More general information.  <comment207885> This will, of course, continue to confuse the heck out of everybody for at least another year, if not beyond ;) Right now, I'd say, if it's not on your computer [& backed up regularly] it's not as safe as you thought it was.
