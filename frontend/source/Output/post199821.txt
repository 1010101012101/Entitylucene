How to drop files from Desktop to Finder windows in a sane way? <body> I know this question looks like a joke, but I've been using Macbooks for a few years and I've never found the right way of dropping files from Desktop to other windows.  Imagine this scenario: I'm on Yosemite, talking on Slack, having some files on Desktop I want to share with on my Slack channel, how do I drag these files from desktop to Slack window? Normally I have to:  ul ligo trough all the windows that are below the Slack window &amp; minimize them (pain in the a...), this step is not actually a step but usually like 30 steps as I have that many apps working in the background,/li liresize Slack window to half the screen so I can see the Desktop, /li lidrop the files from desktop on Slack./li /ul  While on Windows 7/8 it looks like:  ul liclick on right bottom corner,/li liclick on Slack window,/li liresize Slack window,/li lidrag &amp; drop./li /ul  I tried to use the same flow on OSX, so I have "Show Desktop" set as a hot corner, I move to that corner, I can see the desktop but this feature is useless compared to the same functionality in Windows as if I click any app all the windows come back to their places...  How do you do that guys? Can I somehow set hot corner to minimize all windows instead of just showing Desktop for a second? How's that useful?  <answer199829> I would just open another finder window, open a new folder in it. Finder  File New Finder Window &amp; New Folder. ( in your case the top window would be the Slacker window)  Then back in the desktop finder window highlight and drag from one window to another. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JjyNG.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer199830> There are multiple ways to achieve it.   h1Using hot corners/h1  ol liSlide Your mouse to the hot corner to show Desktop/li liDrag Your file (do not drop)/li liSlide once again to hot corner/li liDrop the file to the app /li /ol  h1Using keyboard shortcuts/h1  ol liShow Desktop with kbd⌃ CTRL/kbd+kbd↓ Down arrow/kbd/li liDrag the file (You may need to click on Desktop first to activate Finder)/li liThen kbd⌘ CMD/kbd+kbd⇥ TAB/kbd to previous app and drop it/li /ol  h1Using the trackpad/h1  ol liShow Desktop with gesture (spread four fingers on trackpad)/li liDrag the file/li liSlide on top of the app icon on Dock/li liSlide on top of the window You want/li liDrop the file/li /ol  <comment240670> ZOMG, the first point, my life will never be the same again. WOW. <comment240672> Thanks, that's a great approach also, upvoted. <comment240681> You could press the key combo for "hide others" (command option h) which would keep your foremost app (Slack, in this case) as the only non-minimized app. You would then be able to access your desktop from there. Would this achieve a similar result?
