Speed of Ram via serial Number <body> Is it possible to tell the speed of R.A.M of a Mac Mini by the serial number, and if so where would one do that? I need to know whether or not a Mac Mini is specifically Pc3-8500 through the serial number alone.  <answer188224> You can get any Mac's product manual from   ul lihttps://support.apple.com/manuals/C02PRT1XGCN3/li /ul  Just add your serial number instead of the sample one I provided.  <comment222692> Which Mac Mini? All but the most recent ones have user-replacable RAM or are you just interested in the overall speed qualification and not specifics about installed memory? <comment222693> basically just if it is possible to see the RAM specs via Serial Code <comment222707> No that is one I did not know a + for that.
