Is there a way to transfer many photos from iPhone to Mac without losing filters & edits? <body> Is there an way to get the photos off my iPhone strongwithout losing the filters and edits that I have used?/strong  strongI just want the jpeg files/strong, I don't want to sync the phone to a database like iPhoto or (now) Photos.  I don't want to use iPhotos because it keeps all the photostreams on my MB Air and uses up disk space. I suppose I could use it with photostreams disabled.  If I use AirPlay, it takes emforever/em and chokes when I want to do a few hundred at a time.  strongIs there a way to do it with the iPhone connected by cable?/strong  <answer176095> The best way I have found is with the new strongPhotos app/strong.  In Photos, go to the strongImport tab/strong, then strongselect the photos/strong you want to import.  This will create a strongnew album/strong with the date of the import.  In the new album, press:  precodecmd-A to select all cmd-shift-E to export &gt; choose options export cmd-backspace to delete all /code/pre  note: strongdo NOT choose a subfolder name/strong unless you want every single day to have its own folder.  <answer180568> From https://github.com/nst/filters:     ol   liimport the photos with Image Capture/li   lirun code$ python filters.py/code/li   /ol   The script will read the .AAE files which store the effect and apply the effect to the matching .JPG image.  <comment214707> Thanks, I will try it next time I import photos. <comment227034> This is awesome, thank you. Suggestion: add info about the extra args such as --overwrite, probably the most useful one.
