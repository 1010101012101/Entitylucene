Scroll with mouse in 'less' without clearing the screen <body> When viewing a long file in Terminal with codeless/code (or codeman/code, which uses codeless/code internally), I can use two-finger gesture to scroll up and down the file; it's great. But codeless/code on OS X has an annoying problem: When I quit, it resets the screen back to what it looked like before I started codeless/code.   precode% date Sun 30 Oct 2016 16:18:23 CET % man less % (hmm... where did my output go?) /code/pre  When I quit I want to see the next prompt appear below the last screenful I was viewing in codeless/code. I can achieve this by using codeless -X/code or setting codeLESS=-X/code, which suppresses the terminal initialization sequences. Unfortunately, code-X/code also turns off the mouse-scrolling feature. strongIs there a way to suppress the screen clearing but still be able to scroll with the trackpad?/strong   As I understand it, this would require using a different set of codeterminfo/code settings. I cannot make heads or tails of the whole codeterminfo/code infrastructure. Does anyone have a solution? I'm on El Capitan, in case it makes any difference.  <answer259461> This question is nearly identical to a question asked on SuperUser. Here's a portion of the answer:     So there you are: Either you switch to alternate screen and the terminal's hack converts scroll events into keypresses for less, and the normal screen is restored when you quit; or you don't, and then there can't be any magic converting scroll events to keypresses and less doesn't understand the scroll events.      So what could be done? Well, either implement mouse support in less and let it handle scroll events itself (and live with a nondefault click or copy-paste behavior), or implement another weird hack: upon quitting, after reverting to the normal screen, less could for the last time print a screenful of content, repeating whatever was displayed before you quit.   <comment324476> See [this](http://superuser.com/questions/961719/how-to-make-less-pager-respond-to-scroll-wheel-and-not-clear-the-screen), which may or may not help. <comment324495> That's exactly the same question, thanks! It helps, though unfortunately by explaining that a solution is impossible at the moment. The proposed hack is not a bad idea, though! (Many years ago I made some enhancements to `less`, so who knows...) <comment324496> If you want to write an answer that just refers to the superuser.so answer, I'll accept it.
