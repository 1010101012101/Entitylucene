Can I make certain menus always show ⌥option + click results? <body> Specifically in reference to the Volume menu item in the menu bar;  As I am frequently changing audio input/output settings, and never using the slider that the normal volume menu click shows (I always only use the keyboard incremental volume keys for a few reasons), I'd like to make the volume menu more useful to me by automatically strongalways showing/strong the menu that appears when you ⌥option + click it.  And for obvious reasons I don't just want every system-wide click to be rebound to ⌥option + click, just the menu bar items if possible.  This sounds like a too-specific problem to have a solution, but thanks in advance if anyone could help.  <answer294634> I don't know if there's a way to do exactly that, but if you can't be bothered to use the option key when clicking (maybe you're holding an instrument with the other hand or something?) then a keyboard shortcut to an AppleScript to change audio devices is probably even better.  Here's another question that addresses this approach, and if it's not quite what you're looking for, there are plenty of other people out there talking about this as well.  <comment372060> Wow, this is the perfect response. I realised I failed to list why the function would be useful to me, but then you guessed it! I do in fact play guitar and when plugging in to GarageBand, I have to lean to the right so I use my left hand to hold the guitar from falling forward. Thanks for the links! I actually thought I was alone searching for about 10 minutes on Google, turns out the problem was different enough to not show up but it's an even better solution to my problem. Thanks!
