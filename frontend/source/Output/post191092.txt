How do you get a clickable path to a file or folder? <body> I already saw a lot of questions and answers about how to copy the path of a file or folder using Automator.  I personally like to use the copy option under the action menu on top of your finder because this will give you a path which can be used as a link:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/t5YA3.png" alt="Finder Screenshot"  You can paste this link in your e-mail. It's clickable so the receiver can click it and the exact location of the file will be opened.  But... does anybody know if there is a way to copy this path automatically in an e-mail message using Automator?  I know how to create an e-mail in Automator but I can only copy the 'readable' path in it, which can't be clicked...   <answer191204> You might want to consider using a scripting language to do this. I've created a simple JavaScript for Automation program that can do the job (it can also be fairly easily replicated in AppleScript):  precodefinder = Application('Finder') finder.includeStandardAdditions = true file = finder.chooseFile() path = String(file).replace(' ', '%20') /code/pre  You could then use the codepath/code variable to create a new OutgoingMessage in Mail.  Alternatively, you could use this as a "Run Javascript" block in Automator, then use its result in a New Mail Message (in which case you would need to append codereturn path/code to then end of the script).  <comment226979> Isn't that is the path on your mac and it won't be the path on anyone else? <comment226981> True, if you point out a local file. In the company I work at we all work on a server with millions of files in a lot of folders and subfolders. If I copy the normal way, I get spaces. The above way of copying gives me %20 instead which makes it clickable. <comment226982> The difference:       smb://nl01vf006/Marketing/Season 15 1/15172 Franchise requests/15172004 South Africa New Arrivals Event evite/WKT/JPG/15172004 South Africa New Arrivals Event e-vite 1.jpg <comment226983> and:   file://localhost/Volumes/Marketing/Season%2015%201/15172%20Franchise%20requests/15172004%20South%20Africa%20New%20Arrivals%20Event%20evite/WKT/JPG/15172004%20South%20Africa%20New%20Arrivals%20Event%20e-vite%201.jpg
