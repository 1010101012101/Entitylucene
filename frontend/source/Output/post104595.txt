What would happen if I put an iPad sim card in my iPhone <body> Can I put a data only, no voice or text sim card in an iPhone.   I'm keen to get 4g but I've found the cheapest monthly plan for a nano sim is  strong£33 for 3GB/strong. This included unlimited text(SMS) and unlimited voice calls.  I make almost no calls, and few text messages.  I was looking at what plans were available for the ipad mini (nano-sim too) and noticed it was half the price: strong£15.99 for 3GB/strong. Pretty big difference.  strongHas anyone tried an iPad only sim in an iPhone?/strong   ul liI'd use iMessage, FaceTime &amp; skype to get round the lack of voice and text, and keep my old iphone 4 as a backup with a PAYG sim./li /ul  Notes:   ul liiPad mini wifi - so I intend to tether /li liiPhone 5s(when it arrives)/li linew 4g networks are coming in December so I don't se the point in locking myself into a 12 month plan, when the price is likely to drop./li /ul  <answer104794> I called EE and the guy said I would be unable to make calls or send text messages.  I will try this out and see how I go.  <answer167039> Yes it works with bell 5g a month for $35 . Running it for over a year. Best plan ever!
