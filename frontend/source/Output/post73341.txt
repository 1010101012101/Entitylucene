Stuttering in Quicktime and BBoDs on Mountain Lion <body> A few weeks ago, after installing the Safari 6.0.2 update, Quicktime started stuttering (Music playback in iTunes stutters, playing those silly quicktime videos on Apple's website stutters, etc.). Every now and then the system also freezes for a second or two, and I get a Beach Ball of Death.  I tried reinstalling Mountain Lion on top of the current installation using the installer from the app store, which seemed to have fixed things for a few minutes.  Can anyone who's dealt with these issues share some insight? I heard that their pretty widespread, but I can't find any solutions anywhere.  My Mac is a Mac Mini late 2011, running OS X Mountain Lion 10.8.2.
