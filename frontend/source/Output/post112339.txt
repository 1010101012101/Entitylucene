Create hotkey to insert text <body> I want to create a hotkey command that insert this text "/" in whatever application I'am  The reason is because I'm a developer and I use the / symbol a lot, the problem is with my keyboard layout, that symbol should be made with SHIFT + 7, and thats not easily done with one hand.   <answer112344> strongKeyboard Maestro/strong can type text per hotkey:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ln3Fi.png" width="450"  <answer112348> you could use OS XÂ´s built in correction to achieve something similar.  system settings - keyboard - text  then enter something (e.g. "!!!"), and that will automatically replaced by "/" in all cocoa apps.   <answer112434> You could use a private.xml like this with KeyRemap4MacBook:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;   &lt;item&gt;     &lt;name&gt;test&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;identifier&gt;test&lt;/identifier&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::F1, KeyCode::KEY_7, ModifierFlag::SHIFT_L&lt;/autogen&gt;   &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  You could also create ~/Library/KeyBindings/ and save a property list like this as DefaultKeyBinding.dict:  precode{   "\Uf704" = (insertText:, "/"); // F1 } /code/pre  It doesn't work in all applications though.
