If I turn on FileVault for a TimeMachine drive, are previous backups encrypted <body> I have been running TimeMachine for a couple of months, but just now decided to encrypt my backups.  Having ticked the box for encryption for my backup drive, TimeMachine nows says I have no previous backups.  However, when I look in the backup drive I can see all the backup folders.  Are those backups encrypted, or is it just future ones?  <answer87997> FileVault itself does not encrypt TimeMachine backups at all. But you can specify TimeMachine encryption separately under the TimeMachine options. All contents on the disk should be encrypted then.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qiAkm.png" alt="enter image description here"
