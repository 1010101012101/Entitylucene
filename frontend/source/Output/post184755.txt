Can anyone share original IO80211FAMILY kext for OS X Mountain Lion 10.8.5 <body> Can anyone share original IO80211FAMILY kext file for OS X Mountain Lion 10.8.5 as I by mistake deleted it and now my WiFi has stopped working.  I could not find it on Google, please if you have the 10.8.5, please share original file.  <answer184796> Run the 10.8.5 combo updater, from https://support.apple.com/kb/dl1676?locale=en_GB  This will ensure all updates since 10.8.0 are applied.  <comment219129> Why don't you just [reinstall the OS](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH18872?locale=en_US)? <comment219173> You can also extract the kext from the combo updates manually. <comment219174> @CousinCocaine - for sure, but running it would double-check everything else while you're at it. <comment219191> @Tetsujin Your solution worked... thank you very much and i am accepting your answer! Thanks again!
