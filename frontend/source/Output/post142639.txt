Google Chrome is no longer Retina <body> I am using a 15" MacBook Pro with Retina display, which obviously has an extremely high resolution. I recently opened my chrome browser (which I use regularly and need) and I found the the resolution of everything, especially the text, was extremely low. Everything else is working properly, including Safari and all the other applications I use.   Has anyone had similar issues?  <answer142640> I am currently working with Google Chrome Canary, and it solves the issue, however it is only a beta and does sometimes crash.   <answer142781> I have an MBP Retina 15”, too, and I use Chrome (version 36), and everything looks just like it should. There’s no blockiness, nothing is the wrong size, all text is crystal clear, in short: there’s no problem with a Retina MBP and Chrome.  <comment168031> see this for more information http://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/high-dpi-resources <comment168200> As you can see, there is some confusion whether this is normal or even what you describe. Could you edit the post to clarify exactly what low resolution means? A screenshot or visual comparison might go a long way to illustrating what behavior of whatever build of chrome you currently are choosing to run.
