Does Fluid not support web fonts? <body> I am right in saying that Fluid.app does not support Web Fonts?  The fonts on this page looks nothing like in Safari or Chrome: http://www.typography.com/cloud/welcome/  And I have tried whitelisting the following domains in the Preference, but without luck.  precode*cloud.typography.com* *typography.com* *cloudfront.net* /code/pre  <comment142950> I can confirm that the fonts aren't displaying on fluid for me either. I also have some weird issues with gmail, so I think the version of webkit it is based on is a bit behind. <comment142951> oh, I forgot to mention: I thought that it might be because I have glimmer blocker installed (a proxy that removes ads), but it was not active when I tested to see if the webfonts were working.
