Keyboard shortcut to allow opening unsigned pkg file? <body> I prefer to use keyboard shortcuts rather than the mouse. Is there a a way to define a keyboard shortcut equivalent to Right-Clicking a pkg file and choosing "Open", which warns about opening an unsigned package?  Note this is not the same as the regular File-Open, which simply rejects opening the package altogether.  <answer122409> You can do this with strongKeyboard Maestro/strong using a macro such as this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GN2ON.png" alt="When hotkey pressed, for each file in the Finder&#39;s selection, execute shell script"
