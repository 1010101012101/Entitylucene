How to remove the virus `ad by turbomac` <body> my mac air suddenly infected the virus codeTurboMac/code. So many unexpected ads popped  up on screen(both in Chrome and safari)I search for the Internet, but the goole result which all similar doesn't solve my problem. I downloaded the strongMalwarebytes/strong which is recommended in the Apple discussion board. But it couldn't delete the virus either.    The ads shows like this(very annonying):   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TiOox.png" alt="enter image description here"         Anyone can offer some advice will be appreciate!  <comment318030> There are manual removal instructions at [PCrisk.com](https://www.pcrisk.com/removal-guides/9760-turbomac-adware-mac); I don't know if they'll work any better than Malwarebytes, but it's worth a shot. (And they look reasonable -- i.e. not malicious themselves -- to me.)
