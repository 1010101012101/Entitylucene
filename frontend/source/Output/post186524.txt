Sudden input device hang and automatic reboot after closing the lid <body> MBP (mid 2014 model), Mac OS X 10.10.3. I have two USB input devices: DasKeyboard V4 and Logitech Trackman Marble. strongSuddenly all input devices stopped working including the keyboard and trackpad on the laptop./strong Only power button produced any response (the usual power off dialog popped up). No beach ball, no nothing. This happened twice, and only when I was using it with USB input devices.  This is what was in system.log around the time.  precodeMay 10 12:12:36 zealot kernel[0]: [SendHCIRequestFormatted] ### ERROR: EnqueueRequestForController failed (err=0xe00002bc (kIOReturnError)) for opCode 0x200c (LE Set Scan Enable) May 10 12:12:36 zealot blued[82]: Release the WiFi lock May 10 12:12:36 zealot blued[82]: blued: unable to relinquishBluetoothPagingLockAndReply Error Domain=com.apple.wifi.request.error Code=8 "The operation couldnâ€™t be completed.

Your Bluetooth and your WiFi should be turned off if you do not use them.  It looks like you are using the Airplay, so you might need to turn them on back again.  <answer187109> So I figured it out. It was the strongLogitech Control Center/strong for Marble Trackball. It doesn't leave anything in the system log. The codewatchdogd/code complains every time I close the lid, and it is independent of the input hang phenomenon.

No, I don't have Little Snitch app. <comment220255> thanks, then Turn off the WiFi. and that might explain the server named FUTCHERIMAGER :) <comment220256> Now restart and try your test (with lid close/Open again), You might need to turn on the Bluetooth and WiFi later since you are using the Airplay. <comment220259> @Buscarì›ƒ This doesn't happen every time.
