Can gray weekend coloring be eliminated on Calendar for Mavericks? <body> I'm running OS X 10.9.1 (Mavericks). The new calendar design has the weekends tinted gray.  Fine, I suppose, if you're a 9-5er, but I'm a musician and weekends are my weekdays.  Weeks aren't all the same, and any day can be a work day or a day off.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Jr4Iv.png" alt="Gray color for Saturday"  Does anyone know how to turn off the gray tint if I can't assign my weekends to match my actual schedule?  <answer135319> I checked all of the preference values stored in codecom.apple.iCal.plist/code and there's nothing that affects what days are gray, so I don't think this is possible even with a hidden setting.

Sorry.
