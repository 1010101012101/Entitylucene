Location of Keyboard Icons? <body> I probably should elaborate. I'm looking for the icons for the keyboards (the flags and the cutout-of-white icons used for Japanese/Chinese/that one used for custom inputs). I did some poking around and couldn't find them. If you find them please post an answer. I really need these for something.  <answer234374> The flag icons are located in the file em/System/Library/Keyboard Layouts/AppleKeyboardLayouts.bundle/Contents/Resources/AppleKeyboardLayouts-L.dat/em. The em.dat/em file can be opened/read with the GraphicConverter app.  The em.dat/em file is a flag "database". To access the single flags in GraphicConverter use the pages drop-down menu at the bottom right of the main window.  hr  Several input method icons (e.g. PNGs, TIFFs) can be found at em/System/Library/Input Methods/Input_method.app/Contents/Resources/.../em with emInput_method.app/em one of the various IM.apps in em/System/Library/Input Methods/em.  The Custom Input icon may be this one: em/System/Library/Input Methods/PluginIM.app/Contents/Resources/Custom.tiff/em.  <comment286551> Cool! May I ask either how you found it or how you knew where it is? Also, do you know how I could edit/replace the icons? <comment286556> I opened the .dat file and it's just one (Czech - QWERTY) flag. Am I doing something wrong? <comment286558> I looked through all of them and I can't find the Custom Input icon. Is it in a different file? Sorry if I'm pestering you, btw. :) <comment286561> Like a lowercase `c` in a rounded square (similarly to the icons that aren't flags). <comment286563> Yes. For me it's black on white but I'm using the dark theme.
