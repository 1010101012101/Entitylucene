Is it possible to turn off the trackpad low battery notification? <body> Generally speaking I like to change the battery once the battery is completely used up, but the system will kept notifying me once the percentage dropped below 20%. Is there a way to turn it off (or make the notification only comes up once it dropped below 5%)?  <answer205911>    I don't mind the alert or warning, but I do mind the weeks of having a blinking icon in my Menubar.  Here's what I did in Terminal:  precode$ cd /System/Library/CoreServices/Menu\ Extras/Bluetooth.menu/Contents/Resources/ $ sudo cp lowbatt.pdf lowbatt.backup.pdf $ sudo cp BlueTooth_Connected.pdf lowbatt.pdf /code/pre      This replaces the low battery icon with the same connected icon.  I assume the icon is still "blinking" in that it's switching one for the other, but since they're now the same, you don't notice.      Now I get the 20%, 10%, 5% alerts, but no annoying blink.      This is in Lion.  It's likely that system updates and perhaps even Mountain Lion will undo this, but it can probably be reapplied after updates are performed.      hr      For Mountain Lion, the relevant files are named:      ul   licodeBluetooth_Low_Battery.pdf/code/li   licodeBluetooth_Connected.pdf/code/li   /ul   How can you disable the low battery warnings for bluetooth devices? by seanhussey  <comment213820> would this work for you http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/57427/46541 <comment214130> @Buscarì›ƒ no it doesn't turn off the alerts. It just replaces the icons. <comment214135> That alert is probably there for the Lion batteries which should not be discharged below 20%. I do not know how to turn it off. <comment232874> It is a very annoying alert... My batteries still work for weeks past the 20% mark. Here's hoping Apple will allow us to disable it in the near future.
