How to make Mail resync exchange? <body> For some reason my Sent folder in my exchange account is not showing mail from older than 3 weeks. I've tried clicking on "synchronize" and it doesn't work. I've tried deleting the account and readding it, same thing. I can see fro my online outlook access that there are a lot more mail in the Sent folder. How do I make Mail redownload everything from exchange?
