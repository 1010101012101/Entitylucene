Add Spotlight Comments without tags on OS X Mavericks <body> I would like to add comments to files or folders. On previous OS X versions, there would be a text field to add comments that become searchable via Spotlight.  Now, in OS X 10.9 Mavericks the text field now says 'Add Tags' instead of Comments. When I add text in there, it shows up system-wide. This is not ideal when I only want to tag a single folder with a unique phrase. Is there any way to get File Commenting back?  <answer112790> Turns out, commenting is still there, just hidden a little. Commenting is now a collapsible pane beneath the Name &amp; Extension text field.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lKlM8.png" alt="Comments has moved to a collapsible pane"
