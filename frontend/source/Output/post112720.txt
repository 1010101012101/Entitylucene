Restoring an 10.9 TM backup onto an iMac running 10.6.8 <body> My original hard drive has failed. Would not go beyond grey screen.  It is in course of being repaired with a new h.d. The Apple tech said the machine would be returned to me with mac o/s 10.6.8 installed (this being the latest version possible without passwords etc, apparently)  I have a Time Machine backup on a separate HD. This backup has the latest 10.9 o/s on it together with the latest Iphoto app. and several other apps I use.  My question is: EXACTLY what is the procedure for restoring my repaired machine to it's former state, (Applications, Settings, Stored information etc.)  I would appreciate a simple step by step answer to this point.  <answer112722> Can't give  you exact, as you haven't said how you connected to your Time Machine disk.  I am going to assume it's USB, and recommend simply holding down the kbdAlt/kbd key at boot time, slecting your Time Machine drive, and following prompts...  <comment132350> Does OS X 10.6.8 already support this? <comment132365> I *thought* so... <comment132367> I would probably upgrade from 10.6.8 to 10.9 first (by redownloading from the App Store) and use Migration Assistant afterwards to get Applications and User folders from TM.
