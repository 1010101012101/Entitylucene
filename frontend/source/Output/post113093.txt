How does one install "afloat" on OS 10.8/Mountain Lion? <body> On OS X, I want to show an always-foregrounded, transparent image while working on the application underneath it, for tracing purposes. As mentioned in this other stackexchange question, the solution is the application called afloat.  Great, so how do I get it to work? The old domain now just redirects to a github project page. There is strongno/strong README, and there are strongno/strong installation instructions. I found a closed/wontfix "how to install" ticket, and pieced together some probable instructions. This is what I have so far:  ol liDownload the SIMBL zip file/li liUnzip the file/li liDouble-click/install codeSIMBL-0.9.9.pkg/code/li liCreate SIMBL bundle dir: codemkdir ~/Library/Application\ Support/SIMBL/Plugins//code/li liReboot/li liInstall from the git repo:/li /ol    precode$ git clone https://github.com/millenomi/afloat.git $ cd afloat $ xcodebuild -configuration Release install   # verbose output trimmed, except for last line:   ** INSTALL SUCCEEDED ** $ mv /tmp/Afloat.dst/Users/`whoami`/Library/Bundles/Afloat.bundle/ ~/Library/Application\ Support/SIMBL/Plugins/ /code/pre  So now what? Did I do this correctly? Am I supposed to see additional "Window" menu options?  <answer113094> It appears that this did work. I did find that my X11 app had the extra Afloat options in the Window menu. Reading around, it seems it only works on Cocoa apps, so I guess X11 is Cocoa but nothing else is.  I also found a downloadable dmg installer. I'll try this out too.  <answer143538> I recently tried to install it on Mavericks and couldn't get any of the above instructions or downloads to work. I found a compiled download linked from this helpful article at http://www.chrisvanpatten.com/master-windows-afloat-mac which links to an installer (currently version 2.4) at http://mac.majorgeeks.com/files/details/afloat.html  The instructions and downloads worked great and all is well on Mavericks.  <comment164308> Yeah, the Cocoa apps only is a huge pain :-( <comment182269> I tried building this, but was getting the message, "error: garbage collection is no longer supported". I found some discussion on another project explaining that Apple was deprecating garbage collection (https://github.com/tomaz/appledoc/issues/435) because they want people to transition to automatic reference counting (https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/releasenotes/ObjectiveC/RN-TransitioningToARC/Introduction/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40011226) <comment188500> FYI: The installer also installs a spam-toolbar <comment200173> On Yosemite 10.10.2 with XCode 6.11 I get 8 of these `error: garbage collection is no longer supported`
