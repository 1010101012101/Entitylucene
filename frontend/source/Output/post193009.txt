Windows installer doesn't connect to internet using WineBottler <body> I've been trying to run a Windows program on OS X Yosemite, however, the program comes as an .exe installer and not directly executable binary.  The problem that I'm facing is that the installer must connect to the internet to download additional files, but it cannot.  During the installation process, I get the error of "failed download" and everything stops.  Is there any way to solve this problem?  I was trying to install Pi which is a trading platform from Zerodha.  Also note that, I tried installing another application installs just fine but when I try to run it, it fails because of no internet connection.  <comment229914> We need more info - the program might be trying to call another program etc <comment229922> Which application are you trying to install? <comment229925> I was trying to install Pi which is a trading platform for Zerodha
