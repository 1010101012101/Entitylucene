Software for managing Word files (doc, docx) archive <body> I have an archive of code.doc/.docx/code files, which I'm frequently using to pull some information. I'm looking for some software that would allow me to search through the content of all these files (Mac OS X 10.7.5).  Note: I haven't tested Spotlight because I've turned it off some time ago (because of power consumption related to file indexing; I also didn't need it before).   <answer71708> Devonthink - any of the versions - will index the contents of the files (and many other filetypes too - providing a searchable db, including a concordance.   http://www.devontechnologies.com/products/devonthink/overview.html  Really can't recommend it highly enough.  <comment83272> Honestly, I'd probably go with Spotlight. If it's constantly indexing outside of its usual behaviour, that might be a symptom of another problem that can be fixed. <comment83275> I agree with @DanJ: Spotlight is the first best bet. You may need to rebuild the locate database. Normally this happens once per week, but if you power down regularly there's the chance it hasn't happened in a while. See article [2948](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2948/when-is-the-locate-database-updated) for more about the locate database before trying anything else.
