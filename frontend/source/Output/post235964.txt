Read only access to app store on ios devices <body> I restricted the iOS devices of my kids so they cannot install apps. This was necessary because it's not possible to revoke permissions given via family sharing.  Now the app store icon is fully gone. I'd like to get them some kind of read access to the app store.  Any ideas?  <answer236071> You can use strongRestrictions/strong to disable the ability to purchase apps or to install any apps.  To turn on Restrictions:  Tap codeSettings &gt; General/code.  Tap codeRestrictions/code.  Tap codeEnable Restrictions/code and create a passcode for Restrictions. Don’t forget this passcode. In the future, you'll need your Restrictions passcode to change your settings or to turn off Restrictions.

The question is how to prevent a user from installing apps but give it the chance to search for new apps in the app store and then ask for permission. <comment288846> The Restriction steps above should allow you to prevent the user from installing apps.  I did this with both my kids.  I set it up so that they had to 'ask permission' before they could install any app, free or not.
