Is /usr/bin/etags severely out of date in Yosemite? <body> Is /usr/bin/etags severely out of date in Yosemite?  If so, what is the easiest way to get an up-to-date version of etags, to use with Emacs from http://emacsformacosx.com/?      I am using:  GNU Emacs 24.4.1 (x86_64-apple-darwin13.4.0, NS apple-appkit-1265.21) of 2014-10-20 on builder10-9.porkrind.org.br Yosemite 10.10.1  <answer162074> Would using ctags from homebrew be a sufficient replacement? It is quite up to date (Exuberant Ctags 5.8) and trivial to install if you have Xcode already and then install the brew package manager. It's manual page clearly indicates that it works with Emacs.  <answer162316> The reason why etags is out of date is that the emacs version installed on a Mac by default is also severely out of date.   Emacs comes with etags, so when you install emacs via homebrew, you get a recent etags. But I would expect that emacsforosx also comes with etags.   I emassume/em that, if you look in the application folder, you will find etags somewhere there. Then it is only an issuer of calling this etags binary.  <answer170365> Emacs from http://emacsformacosx.com/ comes with a recent etags:  precode$find /Applications/Emacs.app -name etags\* /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/bin-i386-10_5/etags /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/bin-powerpc-10_4/etags /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/bin-x86_64-10_5/etags /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/bin-x86_64-10_7/etags /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/bin-x86_64-10_9/etags [...] /code/pre  It's the corresponding version to emacs:  precode$ /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/bin-x86_64-10_9/etags --version etags (GNU Emacs 24.4) Copyright (C) 2014 Free Software Foundation, Inc. /code/pre  <comment189522> The man page for etags says "The  etags  program  is  used  to create a tag table file, in a format understood by emacs(1); the ctags program is used to create a similar table in a format understood by vi(1). <comment189566> @AlanWehmann The ctags package I recommended works with emacs. Try it, you'll like it. :-) <comment189823> I looked for an etags binary that might have come with emacsforosx.  I didn't find one.
