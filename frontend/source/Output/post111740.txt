How do I create a groups OS X Mavericks Contacts app that remains local to my machine? <body> When creating a new group in the OS X Mavericks version of the Contacts apps the group is automatically synchronized to iCloud. I'd like to keep this group local to just the machine where I created it.  How can I make a group that stays local to the machine and does not sync to my iCloud account?  <answer112162> You canâ€™t. Mavericks removes SyncServices for local syncing and forces you to place your data in the cloud.  <answer115275> ol liOpen strongContacts/strong/li liFor the strongOn My Mac/strong account, click the strong+/strong button to add a new group.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fbeqb.png" width="200"/li liEnter a group name and press strongEnter/strong.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jrmBn.png" width="200"/li /ol
