Safari extensions corrupted <body> I'm attempting to install a Safari extension and I'm getting a error that says:  precode"1Password-4.2.5.safariextz is damaged and can't be open. You should move it to the Trash." /code/pre  I thought maybe the 1Password was actually corrupted so I tried Ghostery and got the same error.  precode“Ghostery.safariextz” is damaged and can’t be opened. You should move it to the Trash. /code/pre  Any ideas?  strongEDIT/strong  I'm on Yosemite 10.10.1 - Safari 8.0  <answer170271> I do know that Safari 8 requires a new extension for 1Password - you need version 5 (which was a free upgrade for folks using v4 if I remember correctly  <comment200135> Did you try redownloading them? <comment200141> You *can* with a bit of juggling still get v3 to work in Yosemite. I never liked the v4 interface, so I rejigged mine with the v4 plugin but the v3 app, a while back on Mavericks - & it still works on Yosemite. <comment200306> @TheWellington Sadly, the 1Password app and extension numbers appear to be out of sync. According to my system, 4.2.5 is the current Safari extension, but I'm using 1Password 5.0.2.
