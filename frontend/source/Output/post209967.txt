LSOpenURLsWithRole() failed with error -600" I am getting error <body> While running code./getcov -s/code from Jenkin to MAC-OS and I am getting following errors:     LSOpenURLsWithRole() failed with error -600 for the file /Users/imacsbuild/Documents/XXX/XcodeCoverage-master/lcov/index.html.   Has anyone come across such errors?  <comment253463> LSOpenURLsWithRole() is usually a permissions error. Check you have execute perms <comment253464> hmm... actually -600 is 'unknown' so might not be perms, but it's a generic 'proc not found' which I guess is similar to cannot execute
