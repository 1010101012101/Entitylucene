Save data from broken Macbook Pro HDD <body> I have a broken Macbook Pro HDD with two partitions on it: OS X and Bootcamp. I need to take some files from both partitions:  ul lithe HDD is now mounted to another PC via. SATA adapter/li liWindows sees the HDD but i can't access it. For example, I can't format it/li liWith gparted, it says that there's no filesystem, nor allocated space/li liI tried CloneZilla, but since there's no filesystem, it can't copy anything/li liI tried testdisk and photorec without luck /li liI tried fdisk and superbloack options with Linux without luck/li /ul  Now, I don't know if I have to format it and try to recover the files I need, is there a way to repair?  <answer187636> ol liyou can try to connect you HDD to another mac./li liyou can create full copy of this disk via dd vith noerror parameter/li liIf you use windows you cat use Ext2Read for access to linux partition./li /ol  <comment221863> 1. yeah i still have to try this option 2. how i it ? 3. the bootcamp partition has windows installed, iÂ´m trying to use linux to access it <comment221867> You might need to install some app to make windows be able to read and write Mac OS X format. Once you have done that, would it be possible to fix the mac's boot? Or is the damage more extensive? <comment221882> 1. ok 2. you can connect two disk to linux PC: broken disk and new disk, and clone broken disk to new: [link](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Disk_cloning). <comment221883> if you do not break the partition table, you connect the new drive into the notebook and everything will work.
