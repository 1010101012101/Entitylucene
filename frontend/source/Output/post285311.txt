How to stop sound output switching to a monitor when it gets plugged in? <body> When I plug my (HDMI) display into my laptop, the sound output switches to it. I can switch it back, but is there any way to stop this automatic switch?  (I've found many people complaining, but no answers. A script which reversibly disabled HMDI audio would be acceptable.)  <answer285330> I have multiple devices I connect to my mac and for some they had the same issue.   The work around (or actual fix) is to open 'audio midi setup' in your applicationsutility folder and create a 'new aggregate device' or multi-output device' and turn off/on the inputs/outputs sound based on needs.  strongThe plus sign on the bottom left corner./strong img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PQSBA.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment360120> Awesome! Thanks a bunch. Only problem is the sound keys and system audio slider don't work: http://prntscr.com/feufup . What ways have you found of adjusting volume? I have quicksilver and Karabiner so perhaps I could map some key or keystroke sequence to a script which controls the volume? <comment362046> ALoha, sorry for the delay. Just click on the configure speakers and you can  adjust sliders there, cheers :) <comment362074> Not on 10.11 - the MIDI app looks different from your screenshot on that too. I'll say if it works on 10.12.
