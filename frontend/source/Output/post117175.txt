Allow running applications created by guest <body> I try to figure out, how to allow guest to run applications that was created by him.  First thing, I disallow all applications except Xcode in Parental Controls and I was hoping that there will be no problem to run application builded in Xcode. But always when I build a program and try to run it I get a message ("You don't have permission to use the application ...").  Is there any way how to block all applications except Xcode, but allow application created by Xcode?  I don't know if it's helpful, but I'm able to enter root password once in the start of Xcode. So for example, if it's possible to temporarily set permission to execute every program created in specific folder, I can use it to set permissions of output folder of Xcode.
