Can we hide Photos/Videos on iPhone 6s and higher? <body> I want to hide photos and videos on my iPhone 6s. Can I do that directly or I need any apps for that?  <answer278885> Starting with iOS 8, you can hide a photo or video from the strongPhotos/strong app by opening it, then tapping the strongShare Sheet/strong (box with upward arrow). On the bottom row of share actions, tap emHide/em.  You can select multiple photos and hide them in a single stroke this way.  This will hide the photo or video from strongMoments/strong, strongCollections/strong and strongYears/strong, but not from strongAlbums/strong. Starting with iOS 11, hidden photos will no longer appear in automatic albums such as strongBursts/strong and strongSelfies/strong.  <answer278905> The accepted answer is correct, but it's worth noting that hidden photos are still fully visible in the "Hidden" album (they're merely hidden from the other views, as Phong said).  To truly hide a photo so that no one other than you can see it, use the following alternate method:  ol liCreate a new note/li liAdd the photo to the note/li liDelete the original photo from the Photos app (it will still remain visible in the note)  ul liAlso delete the photo from the "Recently Deleted" album, otherwise it will remain there for up to 40 days/li /ul/li liLock the note/li /ol  Now, there's no trace of the photo in the Photos app at all, and your fingerprint (or password) is required to unlock the note to view the photo.
