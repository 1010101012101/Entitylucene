When I click the Appstore button in Passbook I receive the error: "Cannot connect to the iTunes store" <body> When I click on App Store, which rests below all of the features that Apple touts for the service, I am given an error where a prompt tells me that my phone can’t access the App Store. The error looks like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3YuBR.png" alt="image of error: &quot;Cannot connect to the iTunes Store"  Is there a fix for this problem?  <answer65739> Gotta Be Mobile provides a great article detailing the issue with Passbook and a fix. I've reposted the fix from the article below:     ol   liFirst, head to the Settings in your iPhone./li   liClick on General./li   liNext, head to Date and Time which is down the list./li   liOnce you’re in there, you’ll want to change Set Automatically to Off./li   liGo to Set Date &amp; Time./li   liClick on Today’s Date. Once you do that, you’ll be given the option to change the date./li   liMove the year one year forward one year./li   liThis will prevent the error from happening. If you wish to change the date back to the real date, simply set Set Automatically to On and   everything will return to normal./li   liHead into Passbook and click the App Store button/li   /ol   Something about moving the date up might be expiring a certificate or just the adjustment of time back to correct seems to make passbook behave better.
