Keyboard stays lit during sleep <body> When I put my computer to sleep the keyboard stays lit. It is a July 2012 rMBP. I always have to turn down the brightness manually which is really annoying. Does someone know how to fix this?  Also when I try to turn down the brightness the symbol at first indicates that the keyboard illumination is already at zero, so I have to turn it up at first before I can turn it down.  <answer93922> I would suggest an SMC reset. You can find the instructions on how to do so here: SMC Reset (Apple.com)  Tell me if it works.  <comment110124> Have you considered resetting the SMC on the Air to see if the system controller is stuck or not reading a sensor properly?
