Bose QuietComfort 35 Bluetooth Headphones crackling/choppy when connected to Mac? <body> QC35's are linked to both my iPhone and my Mac but when I connect the headphones to my Mac (without pairing to my iPhone) the sound is choppy (brief &amp; frequent loss in audio).   Sometimes pairing my iPhone fixes the problem but not always. What can I do?  <answer294127> When experiencing issues on Mac, open the "Bose Connect" app on your iPhone and connect to your headphones from there (if not already connected).  The app correctly configures the headphones and eliminates all sound issues.
