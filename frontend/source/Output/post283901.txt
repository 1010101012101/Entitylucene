Why are inline images not visible in Mail on macOS Sierra? <body> I'm on Sierra 10.12.3 and Mail wont display inline images. I already Googled for an answer and found a lot of stuff, but no solution so far.   For Yosemite I found this but can't find the option "Automatically detect and maintain account settings" in Sierra. Is it gone?  I already have "Display remote images in html messages" checked.  <answer283937> Did you enable strongLoad remote content in messages/strong in Mail Preferences  Viewing ?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FSsms.png" alt="Load remote content in messages"  Automatically detect and maintain account settings isn't related to your question.  <answer284154> It seems to be an issue with the current version of macOS. According to the 10.12.4 update description page, it fixes issues with displaying e-mail contents badly. Try updating to that and then see if the issue persists.
