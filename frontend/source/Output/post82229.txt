Force integrated graphics card on OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion when working with VMware Fusion 5.x? <body> I want to force the GPU on my 2011 MacBook Pro 15 (A1286) to remain on the integrated GPU while I run VMWare Fusion 5.x.  The gfxCardStatus software doesn't work on 10.8. Is there another solution?  <answer83920> I confirm the latest version of Krieger's gfxCardStatus won't compile on 10.6.8.  The compilation fails with hundreds of errors.  He must have added some 10.7+ only features.  I picked a random, earlier version from his github, and it could compile on Xcode and seems to work without problems.  Download 1.8.1 from:  https://github.com/codykrieger/gfxCardStatus/tree/v1.8.1  <answer84266> With OS X 10.8 gfxCardStatus is no longer capable of enforcing Integrated Graphics card only.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fZL5O.png" alt="enter image description here"  When one uses VMWare Fusion, the discrete graphics card is enforced, which drains the battery too fast.  I have not found any solution online to fix this. But I managed (thanks to PePe) to discover one.  How to use Integrated Graphics Card with VMware Fusion on OS X 10.8:  ul liInstall gfxCardStatus/li liBefore launching VMware Fusion, click on Integrated only (strongTHIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT STEP: click it several times until it has the checkbox on the Integrated only./strong):/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lEotL.png" alt="enter image description here"  ul liThen launch VMWare Fusion, start whatever virtual machine. And don’t do anything inside. Leave it idle.

And this i bacause (as the creator stated) that it will not always shut down the dedicated gfx anyhow. And it can mess up and hang the VM (yes i happend). Also it can make it start with "black" -screen. (fixed by restarting).  <comment94892> What is gfxCardStatus? <comment94924> @Mark It's software to control the GPU in Macs with dual GPU. <comment95031> @bmike, it used to do that pretty well, unfortunately the chief dev (Cody Krieger) is not going to update it for 10.8 (Mountain Lion, http://gfx.io/switching.html#integrated-only-mode-limitations). <comment95032> @Mark, apps like Skype and VMWare and PowerPoint and Keynote and so many others use the discrete (more powerful GPU, mine is AMD, most are NVidia) which depletes the battery twice as fast as the integrated (less powerful, usually Intel something) even though the integrated works pretty well with all those apps. <comment96566> Could you clarify how this helps mist? <comment115341> I have read the official statement and tested it personally and can prove with a certain extent that it actually switches it (based on battery life experiments). <comment166038> gfxCardStatus works fine in Mavericks.  The webpage says it works on 10.7 and later.
