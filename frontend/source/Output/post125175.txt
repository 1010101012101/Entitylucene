Cmd key not working <body> The left kbdCmd/kbd key on my MacBook Pro is not working, the right one does. It seems like it is a software problem with Mavericks. Any ideas on how to fix that?  <comment146486> What makes you think it's a software problem? Mine works fine under Mavericks, and I'm fairly sure if there were a common problem it'd have been widely reported & fixed by now... <comment146519> Did it stop working right after you upgraded?
