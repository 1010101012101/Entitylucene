Screen is not turning on at boot on a MacBook Pro but only after closing lid (sleep) and open (wake) <body> Can anyone suggest something, besides to taking it to Apple service, I'll do that if I cannot solve this by myself anyway?  Since it turns on after waking up it feels like a software (EFI or kernel) related issue but since it doesn't turn on the screen on boot I cannot use kbdcommand/kbd+kbdR/kbd to format disk and reinstall.  I've already tried SMC and NVRAM reset and it also doesn't recognize external monitors on any type of connection, I've tried HDMI, DVI and VGA. This might be related the original issue though.  It's a MacBook Pro with Retina Display, Mid 2012, (MacBookPro10,1), currently macOS Sierra is installed.  <comment322836> elcome to Ask Different. It would help us if you provided additional info, such as the types of devices, OS, etc. Please see [ask] for how to ask good questions that have a better chance at being answered. - From Review <comment322843> Have you tried a power reset? You pull all power including the battery, then press the power button a few times with no power attached.  After that, connect all power back then power it back on.  In my experience of repairing Macs, if this does not work, then you should take it in for repairs. <comment322844> Not possible because my mbp doesn't have a removable battery :( <comment322853> Ah, you are correct that the battery is no longer removable.  Wasn't thinking there.  In my opinion, it looks like it will have to go in for repairs.  They have made it more difficult for people to do their own troubleshooting / repairs.
