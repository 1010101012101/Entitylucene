Available colors in iTerm / terminal.app <body> I'm trying to make my own colorscheme in Vim, but are struggling to see the available colors in iTerm. Here are my iTerm-color-settings:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Gm9BK.png" alt="enter image description here"  Here's how I can use it in Vim (for example using codectermfg=darkred/code):  precodeiTerm color       Vim-color ---------------------------- Normal-red        darkred Bright-red        red   Normal-blue       blue Bright-blue       lightblue /code/pre  So it appears to me, that Vim has both  precode'darkred'   'red'   and   'lightred' /code/pre  ... But as you can see, then sometimes the 'Normal'-color is the Vim-dark-color, and sometimes the it's just the regular color. Is there a reason for that? And are there a system for it, or how does Vim know which color in iTerm to use?  hr  I don't know, if it's of any help, but if I edit an .itermcolors-file, then the colors look like this:   precode&lt;key&gt;Ansi 1 Color&lt;/key&gt; &lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Blue Component&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;real&gt;0.30443088503649635&lt;/real&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Green Component&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;real&gt;0.18199703467153286&lt;/real&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Red Component&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;real&gt;0.83819000912408759&lt;/real&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; /code/pre  <answer288570> By writing code:help cterm-colors/code in Vim, then I got the left side of the following table. By trial-and-error, I tried out different colors from iTerm and figured out the following (ready to be copied into a code.vim/code-colorscheme to help remember what is what:  precode" AVAILABLE ANSI COLORS IN iTerm "  " 0 =     Black                     - iTerm-ref: Black, normal " 1 =     DarkBlue                  - iTerm-ref: Blue, normal " 2 =     DarkGreen                 - iTerm-ref: Green, normal " 3 =     DarkCyan                  - iTerm-ref: Cyan, normal  " 4 =     DarkRed                   - iTerm-ref: Red, normal " 5 =     DarkMagenta               - iTerm-ref: Magenta, normal " 6 =     Brown, DarkYellow         - iTerm-ref: ?? " 7 =     Grey                      - iTerm-ref: ?? " 8 =     DarkGrey                  - iTerm-ref: ?? " 9 =     Blue, LightBlue           - iTerm-ref: Blue, bright " 10 =    Green, LightGreen         - iTerm-ref: Green, bright " 11 =    Cyan, LightCyan           - iTerm-ref: Cyan, bright " 12 =    Red, LightRed             - iTerm-ref: Red, bright " 13 =    Magenta, LightMagenta     - iTerm-ref: Magenta, bright " 14 =    Yellow, LightYellow       - iTerm-ref: Yellow, bright " 15 =    White                     - iTerm-ref: White, bright  /code/pre  The colors with question-marks are unable to be changed (unless I'm blind or something).   <comment364399> I can see, by writing `:help cterm-colors` that there's an explanation of the 16 available colors. It seems that `blue` and `lightblue` refers to the same thing. So some of the colors points to the same ANSI-color.
