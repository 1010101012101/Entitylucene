How to read .awz ebooks on Macbook Pro (Mac OS X 10.6.8)? <body> How to read .awz ebooks (Kindle format) on Macbook Pro (Mac OS X 10.6.8)?  Can it be converted to PDF with hyperlinks properly supported?  <answer41885> I believe the easiest way to read a Kindle ebook on your Mac is to download Amazon's application for that purpose (either from their site or the Mac App Store). As strongThilo/strong points out in the comments, however, a DRMed Kindle title can only be read on the device which downloaded it, so moving the code.azw/code to your Mac won't help. Instead, assuming this is a book you acquired from Amazon's store, you can download another copy and have it sent to the Kindle app on your Mac.  As for converting to PDF, code.azw/code files are DRM-protected Mobipocket files. Assuming you can remove the DRM somehow, there are many resources online that can do code.mobi -&gt; PDF/code conversion.  <comment47517> +1. If they do have DRM, they will be tied to a certain device, however, so Kindle for Mac will not open them, either. If this is something you bought from Amazon, you can re-download it and select "Send to Kindle on my Mac". <comment47550> @Thilo Good point - I've updated my answer to include that info. Thanks!
