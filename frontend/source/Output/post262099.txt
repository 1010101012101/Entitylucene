iTunes not accepting me to download apps from the App Store <body> I was bought an iPad yesterday. I'm actually a 12 year old and want to download Subway Surfers but can't. I always have internet but whenever I try my account is not verified. What's the step foward guys?  <answer262104> Is the account in your name or a parent/guardian?  There maybe restrictions set on the account, or the email address or password maybe incorrect.  As Subway Surfers contains in-app purchases this may also be restricted.  I would recommend speaking with your parent or guardian to get the issue resolved.  Although more information would allow use to help resolve the issue.  <comment328310> Welcome to the community Mark. To try and help you we need more information. Can you explain what steps you're actually taking, whether you have a new or existing Apple ID, etc. <comment328316> A screenshot of the error message would help as well.
