How to determine out what Wi-Fi channel is used from the command line? <body> If I hold kbdAlt/Option/kbd and click the Airport icon at the top, I get a bunch of extra data about the access point I'm connected to.  Most interestingly for me right now is the Wi-Fi channel. codeifconfig/code doesn't seem to include it.  How can I get this same info from the command line?    <answer21977> There is a command line codeairport/code that is buried deep in the system framework that seems to be safe to call from the terminal. You can make a quick shell alias if you prefer short commands.  From macworld  ol liCreate an alias in your ~/.profile for the Airport Utility:br (this should all be on the same line with strongNO SPACE/strong between codeairport='.../code, but it won't fit on one here!)br/ code&gt; alias/codebr codeairport=/codebrcode'/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources//codebrcodeairport'/code/li liThen you can run this command to find out more info:br code&gt; airport en1 scan/code/li /ol  <answer22006> Try running codesystem_profiler SPAirPortDataType/code from the command line - that will probably give you all the info you need. It's not terribly speedy though (just checked it with Lion, looks like the format has changed but it's still all there).  <answer57798> In Mountain Lion try  precode/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/A/Resources/airport -I /code/pre  To see other options use  precode/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/A/Resources/airport -help /code/pre  <comment24246> You should not be dropping things into /usr or /usr/bin.  Create your own ~/bin directory, or create /usr/local/bin. <comment24247> Changed it.  That is the way I would have done it anyway. <comment24248> It gets my vote. <comment24252> Exact duplicate of http://superuser.com/questions/323548/how-to-determine-the-wifi-channel-from-mac-command-line. <comment24263> Thanks but `scan` doesn't show which network I'm connected to. It shows all available networks and their strengths, but I'm not necessarily on the strongest. <comment24279> You might try 'airport -I'
