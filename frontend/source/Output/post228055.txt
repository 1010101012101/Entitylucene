How do I remove mouse acceleration AND increase/decrease sensitivity? <body> I like to do some casual gaming on my mac, however it's frustrating to deal with mouse acceleration. Now I've found various ways to reduce the acceleration, but this affects the sensitivity.. Is there a way to turn off acceleration but also increase sensitivity?  I've tried using: Smooth mouse,  Steelseries Engine,  Various terminal commands  <comment277985> SteerMouse can eliminate all acceleration, if you want it to, movement & scroll wheel. <comment277996> @tetsujin Doesn't seem to change my mouse settings at all..
