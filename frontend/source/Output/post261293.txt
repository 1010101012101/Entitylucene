Clone Windows Bootcamp partition and use on Mac OSX VirtualBox <body> I currently have a Bootcamp partition running Windows 10 on my Mac.   What I would like to do is clone my present Windows bootcamp partition, convert it to an ISO or something and then delete my Windows partition. I then want to run VirtualBox on my Mac OSX and load up my cloned Windows.  I do not want to lose any programs or files on my current Windows partition - I want to simply transfer it over to run in VirtualBox because I want to be able to move this clone around (to another HDD), make copies of it, etc.  I have read this post: Run Boot Camp Windows10 partition inside VirtualBox  However, I am not sure that it allows for the deletion of the Windows Bootcamp Partition.  Have any of you ever done this? Is it possible? What would be the negative aspects, if any?
