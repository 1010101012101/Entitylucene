Is it possible to write to the Boot Camp disk in OS X? <body> I have a MacBook Pro with Boot Camp and sometimes I want to update information on the Windows partition but currently I have to boot in Windows and read from the Mac partition.  I don't want to leave OS X to organize files.  <answer3055> It is possible.  You will first need MacFUSE and then NTFS-3G.  The User's Guide for NTFS-3G can be found here (PDF).   <comment2699> Just be aware of the bug that the Boot Camp partition sometimes disappears from the startup disk screen. I recommend using refit if your going to use NTFS-3G.
