Delays before keystroke events do not work when called from osascript but work on Script Editor <body> My code below works from Script Editor but the delays do not work when called from codeosascript/code. The script executes the keystrokes immediately without the delays.   precodeset myBrowser to "/Applications/Firefox.app" tell application myBrowser     activate end tell  tell application "System Events"     delay 5     keystroke enter     delay 8     keystroke enter     delay 10     keystroke space end tell /code/pre  In this post one of the users said that this was fixed in 10.11 but I am getting the same error on OS X El Capitan 10.11.6.  <comment356658> Notwithstanding the errors in your coding, once corrected, I have no problem getting all the specified delay times to occur when the .scpt file is run via `osascript` under OS X 10.11.6. In your code, you have `keystroke enter` and in this explicit context, `enter` is an undefined variable and as such the code fails, e.g. `... .scpt: execution error: The variable enter is not defined. (-2753)`. If you're trying to press the enter/return key, use `keystroke return`, or if you're trying to type the word _enter_, use `keystroke "enter"`. <comment356660> What happens if you use `key code 36` in place of `keystroke enter`, where I believe you actually mean `keystroke return` and `key code 49` in place of `keystroke space`? (Although I suspect not, I'm just curious if this has any affect on the delay commands running.) <comment356683> user3439894. Thanks for the response. I have tried using key code and on 10.11.6 just now by putting in a delay of 5 seconds. set myBrowser to "/Applications/Firefox.app" tell application myBrowser  activate end tell delay 5 tell application "System Events"  delay (random number from 0.1 to 0.2)  keystroke tab  delay (random number from 0.1 to 0.2)  keystroke tab  delay (random number from 0.1 to 0.2)  keystroke space end tell Still I get the keystrokes executed without the delay <comment356684> I still get the same error. The script executes ignoring the delay. <comment357369> The delay was not getting implemented because of an old version of the osa compiled script is loaded from cache. Have got this to work now with the delays but there is an issue with the osacompile not replacing the compiled version of the script (a.scpt) immediately
