Macbook Air Laptop : Desktop preview picture thumbnail won't show <body> I have the Macbook Air Laptop: OS X Yosemite Version 10.10.5 And on my desktop, usually if I drag a picture or take a screenshot, the file shows up on my desktop, with the preview picture thumbnail so I can see on my desktop all the different thumbnail preview pictures and therefore can easily differentiate from all the pictures. But recently, all of the pictures/files/videos have been showing up as the apple jpeg thumbnail picture with the magnifying glass.   How can I return the photos to their normal desktop preview?
