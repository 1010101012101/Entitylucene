Mysterious OS X File Extension (bug?) <body> I know that OS X uses the emLaunch Services.framework/em to manage the emfile-extensions/em. But the icons which belong to the emfile-extension/em are part of the strongInfo.plist/strong in the package contents of the 'default-opening-application' of that specific emfile-extension/em.  My 'buggy' file-extension is strong*.cpp/strong used by strongXcode as default/strong. Normally it should use the icon given in code/applications/xcode/contens/ressources/XXX.icns/code.  But it doesn't! It's using another strongcpp icon/strong, which i couldn't find in strongmy whole system - in the Xcode app neither./strong  After I changed the XXX.icns mentioned above with a custom .icns file and cleared my Icon cache, logged out and restarted my mac:  For roundabout 2 seconds I could see my custom .icns file as the standard icon for the file-extension cpp. This is actually what I want to achieve permanently!  But after a few seconds the icon changes by magic into the other cpp icon, which I can't find on my mac. What is wrong with my Mac.  Little Conclusion:  ol li1 icon that is not to find in any lib or app/li li1 icon that is default in Xcode for example/li li1 icon that I want to use for an extension/li /ol  The (1) icon is shown. But it shouldn't. It should show the (3) if I did everything right, otherwise it needs to show (2).  (1) is the icon shown in the finder (2) is the icon shown in the inspector:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EPxZo.png" alt="Icon 1"  Here is the icons I want to use:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RdN3Y.png" alt="Icons to be used"  <answer174638> Turn off 'Show icon preview' (in german: Symbolvorschau einblenden) in the view options of the specific folder or all folders and you will probably see your custom icon.    If you want to apply this to all folders click the “Use as Defaults” button.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OrXn0.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment205633> 1) isn't an icon. It's just an extension overlay and a minimized presentation of the real text in your "SchwächenOffenlegen01.cpp".
