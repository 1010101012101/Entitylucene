Apply "Floating/Translucent Window" to all existing sticky notes? <body> If I have a large number of sticky notes on my desktop, each of which a varying permutation of "Floating/Translucent Window", is there a way to "Select All" stickies and apply the "Floating/Translucent Window" operation to them all?  <answer94809> You can set Floating Window as the default behavior for all new stickies, but for existing stickies you will need to set this value one-by-one.  strongTo set the default:/strong On one sticky (any sticky), click Note from the menu bar and set "Floating Window" and/or "Translucent Window" to emchecked/em.  Then select "Use as Default" from the same menu.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZQiin.png" alt="Screenshot showing the menu selections described above."  All new stickies will have the new settings.  You can turn these off on a sticky-by-sticky basis, or you can re-set the defaults using the these instructions.  <comment99229> I don't believe there is a way to do this. Stickies does not have a preferences section nor does it have a .plist file to modify. Everything is stored in a StickiesDatabase file within your user directory.
