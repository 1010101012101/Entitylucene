Primary hard disk not detected 50% of the times on boot up <body> I have a Macbook Pro Mid 2012 model with the following changes:  ul li16 GB Ram upgrade/li liDVD drive replaced with bay and old (existing) 500 GB hard disk for storage/li liMain hard drive replaced with 250 GB SSD (Samsung EVO 850)/li liWindows 10 via Bootcamp/li liMac OS X Yosemite/li lirEFInd installed on bootup/li /ul  Recently, my existing SSD hard disk was giving me lots of issues - so I got a new one and SuperDuper'ed the existing one onto it. Formatted the Windows partition and re-installed Windows 10. I have 50 Gigs on the Mac drive and 200 Gigs on Windows.  The issue I am facing is that on every other bootup, the Mac does not detect the primary hard disk. If I press kbdalt/opt/kbd and hold it, I can see only the 500 Gig data drive (which is not bootable).  I then need to restart and hold kbdcmd/kbdkbdR/kbd (or kbdD/kbd) to get into Internet Recovery Mode, wait till the network selection appears.  Then when I reboot, I am presented with the original hard disk and multiple boot options (Mac / Windows) on rEFInd.  I don't think it is a rEFInd issue as this occurs even with rEFInd uninstalled. This also does not happen when I plug in my old (failing) SSD.  What could be going wrong on the new Hard drive and what can I do to trouble shoot the issue?  <comment311073> Did you already reset the PRAM/SMC? What about your RecoveryHD. Does it still exist? Usually cmd-R boots to Recovery Mode (and not to Internet Recovery Mode) <comment311098> Hi @klanomath thanks for your comment. I don't have my RecoverHD. After posting this question, I read somewhere that clearing NVRAM might help (https://support.apple.com/en-in/HT204063). I did that and rebooted a few times and my HDD is detected always. But I'll wait for a day or two to confirm if that really fixes the issue.
