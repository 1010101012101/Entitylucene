ios 10 imessage block sender how to? <body> I thought there used to be a way from within imessages to block senders. I have tried touching the icon in the middle of the top bar (that shows the phone number), and I've tried the i icon on the top left. Neither of those have the block sender option that I thought used to be there.  The only way I can find to block senders is to go to settings/imessages/block and manually copy paste the phone number to that list.  Is there an easier way?  I've suddenly been getting some really gross/harassing imessages, so I think somehow my number ended up on a list that's being sold/shared. If someone can help me a better way to block imessages, I would greatly appreciate it.
