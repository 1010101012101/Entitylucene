Getting Sublime text to use the latest version of Ruby? <body> I have multiple versions of Ruby installed on my machine. By using RVM, I am able to use Ruby 1.9.2 on the terminal. But whenever, I use Sublime Text, the text editor of my choice, it defaults to using Ruby 1.8.7. How do i change this behavior?  <answer80580> This worked for me.  Update code~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages/Ruby/Ruby.sublime-build/code  precode{   "env":{       "PATH":"${HOME}/.rvm/bin:${PATH}"   },   "cmd": ["rvm-auto-ruby", "$file"],   "file_regex": "^(...*?):([0-9]*):?([0-9]*)",   "selector": "source.ruby" } /code/pre     The env part will add rvm-auto-ruby into the $PATH and the cmd will execute rvm-auto-ruby yourfile.rb when you press Cmd-B. You and add options in between rvm-auto-ruby if you want, like this `”cmd”: [“rvm-auto-ruby”, “-S”, “$file”].

Or you can specify the absolute path to the installation you want (e.g. /usr/local/bin/ruby for homebrew).
