I don't have 802.11n on my Mac <body> I face a problem with my Mac , it was normal, but 2 days ago I was just shocked when I can't find wireless network on adapters list. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bDP4x.png" alt=""  <answer239407> Click the + sign at the bottom from the list and choose Wi-Fi in the drop down menu that appears.  <answer239411> Your WiFi adapter has failed.  I am basing this answer off your statement in the question that it was working 2 days prior, but is no longer working now.  WiFi adapters don't disappear from a systems unless they have either failed or something very significant has been done to the system.  But, to be certain, we have to do some diagnostics first....  Get WiFi info from emSystem Profiler/em.  You can launch it by clicking on the Apple logo in the upper left and selecting emAbout This Mac/em then clicking on "System Report..."  or you can launch it directly from Spotlight by r pressing kbd⌘ Cmd /kbdkbdSpacebar/kbd and typing "System Profiler"  Scroll down to "WiFi" and take a screenshot kbdShift/kbdkbd⌘ Cmd/kbdkbd4/kbd and post it here.  Once you post it, I will update my answer.  <comment293794> I've tried , but there is no option about wifi , only for bluetooth <comment293795> This is not an answer and should be written as a comment once you have sufficient privilege. <comment293799> I made an answer cuz I couldn't post image in comment <comment293800> Post to the original question since it's not an "Answer".  Be sure to delete your "Answer".  I also need to tell you that Hackintosh isn't supported here, so I will be voting to close it.  But, in the effort to spread good karma, you should look at your actual hardware because it appears the software loaded, it's not finding the adapter. <comment293807> I'm using external adapter TP-Link but it suddenly stopped working , what should I do ? reinstalling the driver? <comment293814> Check it on another machine to verify it works <comment294469> it works fine , this issue happened to me when I lost wifi 802.11n in my network list
