Creating a Linux boot drive on a MAC for a Kangaroo Mobile pC install <body> I was trying to use your method to create a USB on my Mac for a Linux boot USB to install linux on a Kangaroo mobile pc.  Here is my process: I tried this with several iterations.  My results are below.  The final result has me stopped.  Any ideas?  precodeRussells-MacBook-Air:~ russellduggan$ sudo dd if=~/Desktop/linuxmint.iso of=/dev/sdx oflag=direct bs=1048576 Password: dd: unknown operand oflag Russells-MacBook-Air:~ russellduggan$ terminal&gt; -bash: syntax error near unexpected token `newline' Russells-MacBook-Air:~ russellduggan$ cd terminal -bash: cd: terminal: No such file or directory Russells-MacBook-Air:~ russellduggan$  Russells-MacBook-Air:~ russellduggan$ terminal -bash: terminal: command not found Russells-MacBook-Air:~ russellduggan$ sudo dd if=~/Desktop/linuxmint.iso of=/dev/sdx bs=1048576 Password: dd: /Users/russellduggan/Desktop/linuxmint.iso: No such file or directory Russells-MacBook-Air:~ russellduggan$ sudo dd if=~/Desktop/linuxmint-18.2-cinnamon-64bit.iso of=/dev/sdx bs=1048576 dd: /dev/sdx: Operation not permitted Russells-MacBook-Air:~ russellduggan$  /code/pre  As you can see I kind of reached an impasse at the last.  Any suggestions you might have I would appreciate.  <answer295168> In your codedd/code command,    precodesudo dd if=~/Desktop/linuxmint.iso of=/dev/sdx bs=1048576 /code/pre  code/dev/sdx/code for the output is incorrect.     ol liThis is a Linux convention, not macOS; use code/dev/diskX/code.  /li liX is the specific disk identifier.  If you are using instructions from a Linux site, they are most likely providing the instructions for doing this on Linux (not macOS) using X as a variable for the specific identifier since the identifier can be different for each user and/or instance as the device is removable./li /ol  In Linux it's code/dev/sda/code, code/dev/sdb/code, etc.  In macOS/BSD is code/dev/disk1/code, code/dev/disk2/code, etc.  Also (thanks to user3439894 via comments) you need to make sure you disk is emunmonted/em but not ejected.  Do this by issuing the command codediskutil unmountDisk /dev/diskX/code where X is the number of your disk identifier.  <comment372560> Whose method? SE isn't threaded so we have no way of knowing what you are referring to <comment372585> @user3439894 - I added your suggestion to the answer - thanks for the catch. <comment372658> It's actually faster to use rdisk2 instead of disk2.
