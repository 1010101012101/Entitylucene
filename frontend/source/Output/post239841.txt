How to enable journaling to be able to upgrade to El Capitan? <body> I cannot update my MacBook Pro 13-inch Mid 2012 to El Capitan and it is driving me crazy. At the moment I'm using OS X 10.8.5 and everything on my laptop is going slow etc.   I have however missed 2 other updates... I have tried to download those ones before installing EL Capitan but it won't allow me. It only lets me download El Capitan and when I down load it, it comes up with this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RNDip.png" alt="enter image description here"  So can anybody please tell me what this means or how I can upgrade?  <answer239853> strongWarning: before trying my solution, ensure you have a complete backup of your hard drive (usually Macintosh HD)/strong  Before trying the method below, try the following:  ol liOpen Disk Utility (booting to Recovery Mode by holding kbdcmd/kbdkbdR/kbd while starting your Mac, select Disk Utility in the OS X Utilities menu)/li liSelect your main volume (usually emMacintosh HD/em)/li liSelect First Aid - Repair volume... then wait for the operation to complete./li liGo to File  Enable Journaling/li /ol  If the above does not work, try  h3Erase your drive and install OS X/h3  (From Apple's website)     You can use these steps to erase the files on your startup disk and install a new copy of OS X:      ol   liBefore you begin, make sure your Mac is connected to the Internet./li   liRestart your Mac.

When I found myself in a similar situation- 10.8.5 running slower & slower- I bought a new drive & and a cheap USB enclosure to put it in then connected it to my system (a Mid-2011 MBP17"), installed a clean version of El Cap on the external then swapped it into my system to start with a completely pristine OS. I put the old drive in the enclosure & selectively moved what I needed to the new drive. Did not use Migration Assistant for that process. <comment294524> Usually you can enable (or disable while holding the alt key) journaling of a volume in Disk Utility. Your answer proposes a time consuming sledgehammer method instead of one mouse click. <comment294525> I'm assuming the hard disk has formatting problems. Will add your suggestion to my answer. <comment294526> You may also add a suggestion to verify/repair the volume booted to recovery mode.
