Why won't my MacBook Pro boot from a Linux Live CD? <body> Whenever I try to boot up from a live cd, it starts to boot and then it tells me:     strongNo bootable file system available./strong   It's an strongEarly 2011 MacBook Pro 13" 8,1/strong with the 2.3 GHz Core i5.  What's going on?   <answer34125> You'll probably want to take a look at strongrEFIt/strong  That's how I booted and installed Linux on my Mac. It's a very nice piece of software.  <answer34126> Macs use the strongEFI Firmware/strong (BIOS for Windows).  You need to download a special Mac ISO that allows to boot on both BIOS and EFI Systems.  ul liFor Ubuntu 11.10 you can download the specific Mac image here:br strong64-bit Mac (AMD64) desktop CD/strong /li liBy experience I know that the following distros allow to boot on EFI systems using the "standard" ISO: Debian, Fedora, Linux Mint/li /ul  Your questions is related to this here on askubuntu.  <answer36618> I installed the rEFIt on my late 2011 Macbook Pro and it messed up the whole startup and login. I never got refit screen after startup which should appear after a few restarts. The opposite, after a few restarts I was not able to login in on the startup screen. The password was still workin, so I could login into the computer using ssh on another computer. Weird. I finally solved it with TimeMachine.  Stay away from fEFIt if you're having the latest Macbook Pro with Lion.   <answer36630> What other commenters have not made plain is that virtually all Linux live boot CDs presume that you'll be using them on a computer that uses BIOS (that's basically all PCs designed for Windows). BIOS (Basic Input-Output System) is computer software in the firmware of the motherboard itself that is the first thing to run at bootup of a PC.  Macs do not use BIOS at all. They use a completely different method of booting the computer, called EFI (Extensible Firmware Interface).  So you need to see if your preferred distribution of Linux has a live boot CD that will work with EFI and not BIOS.  <comment38925> rEFIt will not make the iso bootable. It's only a 'butler' to make multi-booting more convenient. It will *not* help him, if the CD already doesn't boot even though he is holding **‚å•**. However, one should use rEFIt to **sync partition tables** after a linux installation. <comment39089> That's interesting because I was trying to boot the latest Fedora release. If I were to want to build arch on a new partition using that computer would it also cause me problems with EFI? <comment132018> rEFIt isn't maintained anymore. [rEFInd](http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/) is a fork that is still actively maintained (as of Nov 2013)
