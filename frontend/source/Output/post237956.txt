Recommendations for OS X Home Design software <body> Need to do a renovation and the contractors are all using different names for the same rooms.  SketchUp doesn't seem like "real" 3D because when you delete something, its outlines remain.  I have very little time, so this really needs to be "Apple Simple".    thanks in advance!  <answer237990> Talking about 3D modeling software for Mac, I would recommend you to try Blender https://www.blender.org/features/  You shouldn't expect this kind of software can be AppleSimple, because those are creative design tools after all :) Just find the most reliable and easy to use to suit your needs.
