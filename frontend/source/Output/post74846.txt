Problem with MacPorts <body> I have MacPorts installed on my Mac and a lot of ports that were put on my machine years ago by my sysadmin for various purposes. There is quite a lot of garbage out there, but worst of all, the MacPorts system itself is fried.  My immediate desire is to upgrade subversion via MacPorts. When I try to use MacPorts to update itself (sudo port -d selfupdate), I get an inscrutable error message referring to "the log" but it does not indicate which log, as it often does.  After some hacking with -d and poking around at likely logs, it appears that the cc compiler is missing or failing. I have XCode 4.5.2 installed so I am wondering why this issue is occurring.  Bottom line: I am looking for a way to fix MacPorts; then eventually update everything, clean up the inactive ports, and finally make sure subversion is updated.  I am wondering about these possible steps:  ol liUninstall/reinstall Xcode./li liUninstall/reinstall MacPorts. The instructions for this seem to indicate that all installed ports will be removed, which is scary as I am not sure what that would break, but it would probably break something./li /ol  Are these possible corrective paths? Or is there something less drastic?  <answer74847> The command-line tools are no more bundled with Xcode by default (since). Instead, they can be installed optionally using the Components tab of the Downloads preferences panel.  <comment86979> Installing the command line tools fixed the problem. Thanks! <comment87168> The macports log does tell you which is the next log to look at - please give the complete error message line - However in this case the issue is not having the Xcode command line tools
