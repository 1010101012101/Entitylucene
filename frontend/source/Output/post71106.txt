Install wine via Homebrew: Problem with zlib <body> I've got a problem with my installation of wine. (OS 10.8.2, XCode 4.5.2)  With the information I found, I already fixed a few errors, but now I'm stuck on a missing component called 'zlib' and I can't install it via brew. Another error while installing wine appears while codemake install/code for codelibicns/code Anyone got an idea?  Here is my installation-output:  precodebrew install libpng --universal ==&gt; Downloading http://downloads.sf.net/project/libpng/libpng15/1.5.13/libpng-1. Already downloaded: /Library/Caches/Homebrew/libpng-1.5.13.tar.gz ==&gt; ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/Cellar/libpng/1.5.13 checking for memset... yes checking for pow... yes checking for zlibVersion in -lz... no checking for z_zlibVersion in -lz... no configure: error: zlib not installed /code/pre  or   precodebrew install libicns ==&gt; Downloading http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/icns/libicns-0.8.1.tar.

In the end of message will be `Binaries provided by keg-only formulae may override system binaries with other strange results.` and list of keg-only formulaes - `brew unlink` all of them and `zlib` too. Edit: it's too old question and my comment is actual for different situation, but it could help somebody.
