How to block an application (facebook, messages) in Self Control <body> I figured out how to do a while ago, but simply can't remember- how do I block computer applications such as twitter, facebook, and messages in self control?   <answer237524> You just click the "edit blacklist" button add the websites. Pretty simple. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lDA2Q.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer240146> You cannot block apps, as hinted in a github issue on their repository, only websites.  Onefocus is a similar app that seems to be able to do it. I have never tried it nor have any affiliation with it, so I cannot attest to its quality.  <comment286609> I have the same problem. Stayfocus'd is very nice for Chrome, but there simply isn't anything just as good for safari, so I end up using it to waste a lot of time. I want to block safari permanently so I can't waste any time with it. <comment295040> The question is clear about blocking apps, not websites. This does not tell how to block the Messages app, for example.
