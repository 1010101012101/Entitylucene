How do I disable images in Safari 6.0? <body> In Safari 6.0 the 'Appearance' tab from 'Preferences' was omitted.br How can I now switch “Display images when the page opens” on/off ?  <answer60559> Open Safari and go to strongPreferences/strong, then click on the strongAdvanced/strong tab.  There's a checkbox at the bottom titled "Show Develop menu in menu bar".  Check that then close the Preferences window.    You'll notice that in your menu bar between strongBookmarks/strong and strongWindow/strong you have a menu called strongDevelop/strong.  Near the bottom of that menu list is strongDisable Images/strong — click it.  Now your browsing experience is image free!  <comment259380> Does this **Disable Images** saves any Data usage ? <comment261378> @NikhilM Yes, it does. Browser block calls to the image urls so they don't even load.
