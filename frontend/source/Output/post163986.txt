How to print iCloud contact list <body> How do I print my iCloud contact list?  When I printed it the first time, the format was out of sorts, rendering the printed version un-usable?  I thought that Apple was supposed to be easy.  I was shocked to discover that the Outlook contact list is much easier to deal with.  Please help.  <comment192120> Could you elaborate on how are you printing it? <comment192245> I logged into iCloud.com and under the gear icon in the bottom left found a "print" option, Is this where you are? This option worked correctly for me.  Are you printer drivers up to date?  Printing to correct printer (via the dialoge that opens)?  do you have other problems printing on this PC?  What O/S and browser are you using?
