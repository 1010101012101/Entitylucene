Macbook pro with Ubuntu not recognizing external drives <body> I have a Macbook Pro 9.2 Ubuntu and Windows 7 installations (no Mac). After installing both, to speed up the boot time, I executed the following command by inserting the Mac CD:  bless --device /dev/disk0s1 --setBoot  This command boosts the boot up time, however after doing this, the laptop does not recognize any media (USB or CD) while booting up. Is it possible to bring back boot time readability for external devices? Your help is appreciated.
