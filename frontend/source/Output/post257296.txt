How to write-protect a PDF file? <body> I have filled out a form in a PDF file (kind of a contract with signatures and everything). Before sending it back by email I would like to make it readonly so that the form data canâ€™t be changed anymore.   Is there any inexpensive way to write-protect a PDF file in macOS?  May some option in Preview, Adobe Reader or some Terminal command?   <comment321227> I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because it does not appear to be about Apple hardware or software within the scope defined in the [help centre](http://apple.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic). <comment321228> @Tetsujin I wouldn't say the question is completely off-topic taking into account that the drawing model utilized by Quartz 2D is based on PDF specification 1.4 and OS X/macOS is delivered with Preview. <comment321231> @klanomath - the spec is on-topic, but the question contains so little detail it may as well be about Adobe Reader on Windows as it stands. <comment321255> You might be able to protect the original file by locking it in its Info window. <comment321299> @KarlC You mean write protection in the file system. However, I need it to be write protected even after mailing it. Sorry about not providing enough detail in the first place!
