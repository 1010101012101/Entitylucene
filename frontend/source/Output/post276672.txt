It seems as though there are both severe formatting issues and no clear information about the product. Furthermore, it seems to be a duplicate of some of our [Activation Lock](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/114985/how-can-i-bypass-activation-lock/120695?s=1|0.0000#120695) posts as well as some of our [Resetting iPhone](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1775/how-do-i-erase-an-iphone/1777#1777) posts. Best of luck!
