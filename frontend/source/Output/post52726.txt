Is there a second-generation Airport Express 802.11n? <body> In late 2011 there were refreshes to Airport Extreme and Time Capsule. At the time there was speculation that there would be a second generation of the Airport Express 802.11n model.   I'm in the market for a new one but I can't find any solid evidence that there was actually a new model ever released. I notice when checking my current model's serial number that Apple specifies it as strongAirPort Express 802.11n (1st Gen)/strong, which makes me think there's a later generation, but again I have no actual info on it.  Does anyone have an answer on this?  <answer52728> Not yet on a 2nd gen 802.11n Express.  Apple has published four different manuals on the Airport Express:  ul liAirPort Express 802.11n (1st Generation) - Setup Guide/li /ul  The three expresses prior to that were not 802.11n so perhaps that's where the three previous generations (and the 1st and only newer generation names have come to be) A tad confusing, no?  <answer79971> It's out now i guess -- AirPort Express 802.11n (2nd Generation): Guide to ports and connectors  <comment73210> In one sense this question is dated (and out of date) - but it does document the confusion around the product in this time frame. I see no reason to delete it at present, but if you really wish it to be deleted - flag again or @ me in a comment here and I can do that. <comment73213> No, that's fine. It likely has enough context that it wouldn't be confusing for someone else.
