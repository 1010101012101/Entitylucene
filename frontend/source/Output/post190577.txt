What are all these extra hidden files (with hash digests) that I can only see when running "ls"? <body> Since upgrading to Yosemite, there seems to be an extra class of hidden files that are 'more hidden'. They are visible when I run codels/code, but not in my Finder (even though regular hidden files are visible on my machine).  For example, I can see code.DS_Store/code in Finder, but then when I run codels/code in my terminal I can see extra versions:  precode.DS_Store ._.DS_Store.4ohM2f ._.DS_Store.b03KXd ._.DS_Store.zFFTiN /code/pre  I suspect they might be some kind of revision history being saved for Time Machine, but I haven't set up Time Machine on my computer.  What are they and how do I get rid of them?  <answer190623> I will offer one example involving files with the prefix code._/code.   I have two volumes named Steelhead2 and Shark3. The volume named codeSteelhead/code is hfs+ formatted and the volume named codeShark3/code is ExFAT formatted. Consider the file codeiprogram.txt/code which has extended attributes. I can display these attributes using the codels/code command as shown below.   precodeSteelhead:Steelhead2 davidanderson$ ls -l@ /Volumes/Steelhead2/iprogram.txt -rw-r--r--@ 1 davidanderson  staff  22668 May 26 10:22 /Volumes/Steelhead2/iprogram.txt     com.apple.FinderInfo       32      com.apple.TextEncoding     15  /code/pre  Using the Finder, I copy this file to an empty folder named codedots/code on codeShark3/code. Again using the codels/code command I get the following.  precodeSteelhead:dots davidanderson$ ls -la@ /Volumes/Shark3/dots total 1024 drwxrwxrwx  1 davidanderson  staff  131072 Jun  8 10:46 . drwxrwxrwx  1 davidanderson  staff  131072 Dec 31  1979 .. -rwxrwxrwx  1 davidanderson  staff    4096 Jun  8 10:47 ._iprogram.txt -rwxrwxrwx@ 1 davidanderson  staff   22668 May 26 10:22 iprogram.txt     com.apple.FinderInfo        32      com.apple.TextEncoding      15  /code/pre  Partitions formatted ExFat can not have extended attributes. So OS X created the file code._iprogram.txt/code to contain these attributes. Next, I create a new folder named codedots/code on codeSteelhead2/code and use the Finder to copy just codeiprogram.txt/code to this folder. Using codels/code, I get the following.  precodeSteelhead:Steelhead2 davidanderson$ ls -la@ /Volumes/Steelhead2/dots total 48 drwxr-xr-x   3 davidanderson  staff    102 Jun  8 11:12 . drwxrwxr-x  26 davidanderson  staff    952 Jun  8 11:11 .. -rwxrwxrwx@  1 davidanderson  staff  22668 May 26 10:22 iprogram.txt     com.apple.FinderInfo       32      com.apple.TextEncoding     15  /code/pre  Since codeSteelhead2/code is hfs+ formatted, there is no need for a code._iprogram.txt/code file. Finally, returning to the folder code/Volumes/Shark3/dots/code, I will remove the file code._iprogram.txt/code and enter the 'ls' command, as shown below.  precodeSteelhead:dots davidanderson$ rm /Volumes/Shark3/dots/._iprogram.txt Steelhead:dots davidanderson$ ls -la@ /Volumes/Shark3/dots total 768 drwxrwxrwx  1 davidanderson  staff  131072 Jun  8 10:46 . drwxrwxrwx  1 davidanderson  staff  131072 Dec 31  1979 .. -rwxrwxrwx  1 davidanderson  staff   22668 May 26 10:22 iprogram.txt /code/pre  The extended attributes are gone.  You are correct, these code._/code prefixed files are hidden in the Finder. Even if you use codedefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE/code, these files remain hidden.  If you find code._/code files in your hfs+ formatted partitions, some operation did not get synchronized property. Try using the command codedot_clean/code to remove these '._' files. For more information either enter codeman dot_clean/code or see dot_clean -- Merge ._* files with corresponding native files.   <comment226325> The ._.DS_Store.random_extension files, e.g. ._.DS_Store.4ohM2f, have nothing to do with Time Machine and are probably orphaned and why they can be seen in Terminal as normally they shouldn't and normally should have been deleted when updating the ._.DS_Store file . If they existed on my system I'd delete them using the `find` command, however do it at your own risk. `find \ -name "._.DS_Store.*" -delete` <comment226353> But why can't I see them in Finder and other places like my IDE file browser? I can see normal hidden files, just not these ones. This makes me think these files are something OS-related. <comment226362> user3439894: Have you ever tried the command `dot_clean`? <comment226364> @David Anderson, I totally forgot about `dot_clean` and certainly recommend using it over deleting with the `find` command.  I'd do it first with `-- Merge` and then with `-n` and if any ._.DS_Store.random_extension files, e.g. ._.DS_Store.4ohM2f, exist after that resort to using `find` with `-delete`. <comment226392> The issue here is not how to delete files, I can do that. I'm trying to understand what these files are, what put them there, etc, and how to prevent them appearing in future.
