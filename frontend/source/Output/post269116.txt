How to stop note to stop auto convert double qoute to inverted comma? <body> This is the text I want to keep in a note:  precodegcloud compute --project "wordpress-test" instance-groups unmanaged create "instance-group-wordpress" --zone "us-central1-b" /code/pre  However note will always automatically convert the last double quote to a "smart inverted comma" like so:  precodegcloud compute --project "wordpress-test" instance-groups unmanaged create "instance-group-wordpress" --zone "us-central1-b” /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OkMhP.png" alt="enter image description here"  (You have to manually type it in order to trigger this behavior)  Is there any way I can stop this conversion?  <answer269117> Right-click inside your note, then uncheck the following option:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LA7UM.png" alt="Smart Quotes Substitutions"  strongNotes/strong will no longer replace your smart quotes. Unfortunately, this applies to all notes. I don’t think there is a way to restrict this setting to a single Note.  <comment338053> That's good enough for me. I am happy to have it turned off for all notes
