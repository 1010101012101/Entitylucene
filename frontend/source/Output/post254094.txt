Character Accent Menu doesn't appear anymore in macOS Sierra <body> Before upgrading to macOS Sierra, I really liked the Character Accent Menu by doing a long press on a key (for example, the character e) and being able to add an accent on it.   However, this functionality seems to not work anymore, and so far, I can't find out why?   Also, before, doing a long press on the delete button, would repeatly delete characters. Now, it is doing only one character deletion disregarding how long I'm pressing the key. So if I want to erase 10 characters, I need to press the delete button 10 times...  Also, I am not able to log off or shut down. When doing it, all applications are closed, status bar disappears but nothing happens. The dock remains here. I have no way to shut down or log out without doing a long press on the power button.  Is someone facing the same issue?  EDIT : Logging with a new user account or guest account fix all the problems. But I still would like to know what, in my user account, became corrupted during the upgrade.  <answer254118> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LFHFI.png" alt="enter image description here"  As @kees said, just try to reboot.  On mine, no problem with this tool.  <answer254159> Open up the terminal and type in:  precodedefaults write NSGlobalDomain ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool true /code/pre  This will toggle the Character accent menu.  <answer254161> Try adding a French or Spanish input source to your list in system prefs/keyboard/input sources and restart.    <answer255034> I could fix the issue by following the steps here: https://www.cnet.com/news/fix-keyboard-input-not-behaving-properly-in-os-x/  Quite simple. Sorry for the troubles.  <answer268386> I've just got the answer to this from Apple. Go into Settings, Keyboard and make sure the Key Repeat slider is set to Slow and the Delay Until Repeat slider is set to Short. That fixes it. If the keyboard is working too fast, the menu won't appear.  <comment316285> I'm not have those issues, however I did a clean install not an upgrade. <comment316302> I had the same problem but it disappeared after rebooting so: have you tried turning it off and on again? <comment316306> Go to your Keyboard Preferences - Keyboard. What's your key repeat? <comment316321> Preferences are good. I rebooted the computer many times, problem is remaining. I also clear all the machine and user preferences related to the system and keyboard, ... Play with the different values for this command: defaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false  No changes. <comment316322> Preferences are good.

Control-Command-Space to open it <comment316332> Char View is good. <comment316333> After the command line, did you reboot ? <comment316343> Yes of course. But I found this another bug. When I try to shutdown/reboot/log out, all the applications are being closed, the dock too. But then only my wallpaper remains and my mouse. I can't do anything else except hard reboot by long pressing the power button... My system might be corrupted somewhere. <comment316346> Maybe you should try to reinstall macOS Sierra to fix something ? <comment316381> Comments indicate this has been tried already various times. <comment316571> French was always in my input source as it is my native language.  I removed and added it, reboot. Nothing change. I can use the French input source but I would like to avoid switching between, and remember also the keys.  Also, this key repeaters is bothering me. Not working at all. <comment316572> I think that's gonna be the last solution. But I also use my computer as BYOD at my company. I'm kind of scared of erasing the disk and forget to back up something. Also, there are some applications preferences I would like to keep but Time Machine is not a solution for me unfortunately. <comment316615> Have you installed any antivirus stuff like webroot?  This can cause such problems. <comment316752> Not at all. As I mentionned, this issue appeared right after upgrading to MacOS Sierra. <comment316753> Try setting up a new account and see if it has same problem. <comment316904> Using a guest user make all the problems disappear indeed. It might be the fastest solution but my curiosity makes me wanna know what's the real problem behind my user account. <comment316922> Presumably it's a broken .plist or cache in Home/library, but hard to know exactly what. <comment336937> Welcome to Ask Different!  I don't see how this answer relates to the OP's question.
