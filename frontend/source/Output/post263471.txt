Raid keeps going offline on access of a specific file <body> I have  a seagate 500 GB drive that I set up as mirror raid with a single drive.  This way I can add a drive later.  A few days ago I added a Samsung drive to the array and told it to rebuild.  Gets 99% done.   Zott! both drives go offline.  Both list failed.  Reboot.  No change.  Power off.  Seagate shows up just fine.  Start up Aperture.  "You need to rebuild"  Ok.    Gets 99% done.  Zott!  Message.  Disk not ejected properly.  Ok.  Use Rsync and copy the aperture library to another disk.  This worked.  Started copying other files over.  Zott! Failed on a postscript file.  strongAdditional information:/strong  emI figured since rsync was able to construct the initial file list, it was able to read the directory, but not the file.  I removed the file, restarted the the rsync, and this time it ran to completion./em  precode2016-12-04 8:51:11.000 AM kernel[0]: AppleRAID::completeRAIDRequest - error     0xe00002ca detected for set "LookingGlass" (B4A0692F-7446-48F7-AF88-   56AAC47B6F43), member 57C06EB1-0FC6-40D8-A194-E0FEADD9DE4A, set byte offset = 279589744640. 2016-12-04 8:51:11.000 AM kernel[0]: AppleRAID::recover() member 57C06EB1-0FC6-40D8-A194-E0FEADD9DE4A from set "LookingGlass" (B4A0692F-7446-48F7-AF88-56AAC47B6F43) has been marked offline. 2016-12-04 8:51:11.000 AM kernel[0]: AppleRAID::restartSet - restarting set "LookingGlass" (B4A0692F-7446-48F7-AF88-56AAC47B6F43). 2016-12-04 8:51:26.000 AM kernel[0]:   LookingGlass[0x100000533]::terminate(kIOServiceSynchronous) timeout 2016-12-04 8:51:26.000 AM kernel[0]: hfs: unmount initiated on LookingGlass on device disk7 2016-12-04 8:53:29.169 AM fseventsd[47]: disk logger: failed to open output file /Volumes/LookingGlass/.fseventsd/fc0075d18566e0c3 (No such file or directory). mount point /Volumes/LookingGlass/.fseventsd 2016-12-04 8:53:29.169 AM fseventsd[47]: disk logger: failed to open output file /Volumes/LookingGlass/.fseventsd/fc0075d18566e0c3 (No such file or directory). mount point /Volumes/LookingGlass/.fseventsd 2016-12-04 8:54:15.000 AM kernel[0]: AppleRAID::restartSet - restarting set    "LookingGlass" (B4A0692F-7446-48F7-AF88-56AAC47B6F43). 2016-12-04 8:54:44.000 AM kernel[0]: AppleRAID::degradeSet - starting the set "LookingGlass" (B4A0692F-7446-48F7-AF88-56AAC47B6F43). 2016-12-04 8:54:44.000 AM kernel[0]: hfs: mounted LookingGlass on device disk7 /code/pre  On accessing this file the drive clicks 3 times.    My current working suspicion is that the directory entry for the file was corrupt, and pointed to a sector number that was beyond the end of the disk.  Is this possible?  Shutdown + boot is getting old.  ol liIs there a way short of power cycling the machine to get the disk to come back?/li liIs there a way copy the good files without tripping the drive fault?

So far only the ONE file has been problematic./em/li liWhy is the drive going offline instead of just reporting an error?  Seems rather hostile./li /ol
