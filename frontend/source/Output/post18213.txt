How to disable Developer and Web Searches in Spotlight? <body> Yesterday I upgraded to Lion and it seems it got some additions on Spotlight - the Developer and Web Searches groups.   Sadly I couldn't find a way to disable them. There isn't an option in the Spotlight preferences and I couldn't find the right codedefaults/code option.   Any ideas on how to hide them? They are cluttering Spotlight FAR too much :)  <answer21175> Although the Search Results do not have toggles to sort or suppress these results, it's trivial to add the folders to the Privacy Pane.  Perhaps something like this might work to Suppress the Developer hits? img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4CyW9.png" alt="enter image description here"  I don't see an obvious way to suppress the Web Search yet, but thankfully it's placed last as a catch all - last resort. I'll probably feedback / bug Apple if 10.7.1 doesn't address that with a preference.  <answer21786> I detailed a fix in this blog post: http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1193533  <answer154796> Only one solution I could find, block all spotlight web access using little snitch. I guess this is up there with iCloud helping itself to your personal files.  <answer181326> Spotlight thinks you are a 'Developer', if you have Xcode installed, or happened to install it at any time in the past, and hence shows you search results that maybe relevant to a developer.   When Xcode is actually installed and present on the computer, a check-box called 'Developer' appears in the codeSystem Preferences &gt; Spotlight &gt; Search Results/code panel giving us the option to disable 'Developer' results from appearing in our searches. When Xcode is not detected, the check-box disappears from the Preferences Panel, but Spotlight continues to show results from the 'Developer' category.   I am currently on Yosemite, and had installed and un-installed Xcode way back on Mountain-Lion or Lion, opting to use the 'Command Line Tools' instead. I also had Spotlight disabled until recently, and started getting hundreds of Search Results under the Developer category, once I re-enabled it. The clutter was making spotlight unusable.   Unable to find a solution anywhere on the Web, this is what I finally tried, and it worked:  I created an empty file called codeXcode.app/code in the Applications folder, and the missing 'Developer' check-box showed up in Spotlight Preferences, which I could then un-check to solve my problem.  Open codeApplications &gt; Utilities &gt; Terminal.app/code then type and press Enter after each of the following lines to create the dummy Xcode app  precodecd /Applications touch Xcode.app /code/pre  then head to Spotlight Preferences and uncheck 'Developer' (you might need to restart the System Preferences app to see the missing check-box appear).   Notes:   ul liYou need to keep the dummy codeXcode.app/code even after changing the setting, deleting it will cause the setting to revert back./li liAnother solution would be to install Xcode itself/li /ul  <comment23507> Well this means that I have to exclude my whole HD... :( <comment23545> I've tried to get a flood of developer results but can't. It only contributes one, two or three hits to the bottom of the list spotlight window. What are you seeing and how could the developer files be anywhere but the developer folder? <comment23565> As a web developer myself, I have a projects folder in my home dir. Every project have more than enough files in it and it just fills the spotlight results with items I do not want there. Not that it gets in my way or anything, I still get the results I'm looking for at the top, but it still annoys me to have them there. <comment23568> Certainly file a bug - they added a class to the tool, it needs to be orderable/filterable like all the other categories of data. <comment23978> This only works for removing the Developer category. <comment24004> Welcome to Ask Different! The community appreciates answers that are more than just a link. It's okay to have al ink in your answers, but you must also summarize it in the answer itself. The idea is to make the answer able to stand on its own. Thanks! <comment228749> Further explanation about Nathan's comment: what if the site you linked to goes down?...
