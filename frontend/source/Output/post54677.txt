How can I speed up Mouse Keys? <body> I have been exploring the OS X accessibility option to control the mouse from your keyboard (as described here) and I am curious if there is a way to make it go faster.    <answer54683> KeyRemap4Mac is a nice program that has a large number of various configurations which allow you to modify the function of your keyboard, including the ability to speed up you mouse navigation via the keyboard!  Look in look in codeMouse Keys/code section.  <answer116734> Step 1:  First I turn off Mouse Keys, then I open Terminal and execute this command:  precodedefaults write com.apple.universalaccess "mouseDriverInitialDelay" 0.05 /code/pre  After re-enabling, mouse starts moving almost immediately.  Step 2: Install the demo version of ControllerMate ( http://controllermate.com ), and create something similar:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HRsax.png" alt="enter code here"  Now pressing the Ctrl key will act as a turbo key, moving your mouse very fast instantly. (If anybody knows an alternative to the otherwise great ControllerMate, please leave a comment.)  <comment83564> If someone is able to find how to change this from say a bash script, I will be very appreciative, this is just what I'm working off for now...
