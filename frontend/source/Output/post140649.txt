Choose what to sync to iPad from iTunes server without using desktop iTunes <body> So I'm sitting on the couch and I realize that my iPad doesn't have a particular movie that my son is looking for.  Ok, no problem I tell myself, I'll just go into the Videos app and transfer it from my iTunes server to the iPad.  Only, I can't seem to figure out how to choose which videos to sync over.  I'm eyeing my iTunes/media server across the room and I'm pretty lazy at the moment to plug my iPad into it, open iTunes, and start choosing...  Sure, I can just hit the "shared" button in the app and see a list of movies I can play, but I want this movie to be playable offline.  Is there any way I can navigate my media server strictly from the iPad and select which "stuff" to sync over and then perform a sync?
