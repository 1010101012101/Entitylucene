How is "Show alerts from my contacts" for Messages in iOS Notification Center supposed to work? <body> I've started using 2-factor authentication with a bunch of services. So, after I sign in, I get an authorisation code SMS'd to me. Now, if my phone is locked, I really don't want code appearing on the lock screen, but I generally like showing the SMS preview.  I noticed in Notification Center - Messages, there is a choice:  Show Alerts from Everyonebr Show Alerts from My Contacts  Now, I assumed that if I chose, "Show Alerts from My Contacts", but kept "Preview" on, if the SMS sender wasn't in my address book, I wouldn't see the Alert, and certainly not the Preview on my lock screen. However, I can't find any discernible difference between these two settings.  Every SMS I get from numbers NOT in my address book, I see the banner if the phone is unlocked, and I see the Preview if it is locked, and I see the Preview on the Lock Screen in the Notifications pulldown.  What gives? Am I misunderstanding the functionality of this setting?  It's an iPhone 5S, running 7.1 (11D167)  <answer126983> There's 2 different things here which are not pretty clear.  First of all, there's strongSMS/strong and strongiMessage/strong.  And like explained on this blog you can restrict iMessages from giving a notification if you decide you want strongcontacts only/strong (since iOS6). This does not work for SMS.  With iOS the name of strongShow iMessage alerts from/strong changed, but the functionality remained the same.
