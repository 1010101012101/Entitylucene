SSD adapter for optical drive <body> I'm going to add a SSD drive to my macbook pro. I'm wondering if the optical drive adapter can have any influence on the disk speed, taking it down from a SATA III to a SATA II or I.  <answer73393> Regarding SATA I, II and III and getting the best speeds speeds — it really depends on what specification your machine is, and what adapter you get.  I would suggest you stronginstall the SSD in place of your original HDD/strong, that way you don't lose out on the SSD's potential because of an adapter:  ul liMacBook Pros from Early 2011 and onwards do have SATA III (6 Gbit/s) connectors for their main HDD compartment./li liBut ones from Mid 2010 and before have SATA II (3 Gbit/s)./li /ul  In either case, I would install the SSD there, and then stronginstall the HDD in the optical bay/strong, because:  ul liFrom what I know, newer MacBook Pros support SATA III in their SuperDrive bay — so to take advantage of it, you'll need to get an optical bay adapter bracket that supports it too./li liMacBook Pros from around 2011 (and older) have SATA II in the optical bay./li /ul  To find out what you have, go to Spotlight (the magnifying glass in the top-right of your screen), and type "System Information", open that app, go to codeHardware &gt; Serial-ATA &gt; Link Speed/code and it should say there.
