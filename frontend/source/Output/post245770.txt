Per the Steam Store the Mac OS X Requirements are as follows:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/S3Y0N.png" alt="enter image description here"  However, if you are still not sure, you should direct your question to the Steam folks.  <answer245791> Being a well-optimized, OpenGL game, I am pretty certain it will run pretty fine on you Mac (you might need to turn some of the video settings down). But either way, you can always get a refund for the game:     You can request a refund for nearly any purchase on Steamâ€”for any reason. Maybe your PC doesn't meet the hardware requirements; maybe you bought a game by mistake; maybe you played the title for an hour and just didn't like it.   (from the Steam website)br/  I really recommend you read more about Steam Refunds here, and then buy the game. It's a really awesome, EXTREMELY competitive game (and I mean, 120-tick rate type of competitive) with a HUGE and very... interesting community. Unless you are Russian, then you might want to re-consider it. #RussianStrikeSilverOffensive :P  <comment303059> The issue is is the video card better than the two given? and note the specs are not from Steam but the publishers <comment303130> Thank you very much for your respond i'm going to try it out! <comment303131> Thank you very much for your respond i'm going to try it out!
