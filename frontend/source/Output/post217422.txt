iTunes shortcut to delete files from disk <body> I remember iTunes has a shortcut "Cmd + Opt + delete" to delele files from disk, it works in any playlist in iTunes. But now it's no longer available.  Thank you for your help.  <answer217426> In fact, after iCloud Music Upgrade, codeOpt + Delete/code gives 2 options now,   ol liDelete locally/li liDelete from iCloud Music Library/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/e1ydG.png" alt="enter image description here"  You can remove local copy from Edit Menu though  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zvpCM.png" alt="enter image description here"  You can add a Keyboard Shortcut for this form codeKeyboard Shortcuts/code codeSystem Preferences/code  Make sure the iTunes Media Folder is set up correctly for you.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0O8Lb.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment262819> Can't repro, 10.11.1 & iTunes 12.3.1.23 Works with delete or backspace <comment262840> Sorry but Opt + Delete doesn't work. The .mp3 file is still in my hard disk. I download MP3s from other sources and put it locally. <comment262852> @Matt, have you enabled "Copy files to iTunes Media folder...` in iTunes' preferences? It deletes the file only from the Media Library. <comment262855> It doesn't delete files that you play from say Downloads folder <comment262861> Arrrg, thank you, not exactly as your instruction, I change the path to my external disk (where I saved all my MP3 files), and now the shortcut works like a charm. <comment262862> @Matt, awesome, glad you could get it working :) <comment370378> Is this still supposed to work? "Delete" now seems to be under Song  "Delete from Library" instead, and there's no keyboard command attached to it by default. Furthermore, I don't have a proper Delete key on my MacBook Pro.
