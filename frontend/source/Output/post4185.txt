I forgot the passcode for my iPad restrictions. How can I disable them? <body> I added restrictions to my iPad and I forgot the passcode for them, now what? Is there a way to remove it without resetting the device?  <answer4186> The short answer is no.   The long answer is wipe the device and then start over. If you have a backup, hopefully it's from before the restrictions were set.  <answer192198> According to Apple:     If you lose or forget your Restrictions passcode, you'll need to erase   your device and then set it up as a new device to remove the passcode.   Restoring the device won't remove the passcode.   So apparently restoring from a "pre restrictions" backup won't help either.  <answer224328> There's a tool that can recover the restrictions passcode from a device backup, called empinfinder/em. Download the tool at the pinfinder github page, make an strongunencrypted/strong backup and follow the instructions.  <answer241779> Alternatively one can use Forgot iPhone via iCloud to Erase their phone if the problem is similar to this  This will wipe your entire data and you can setup your iPhone as new.  <comment4001> The long answer? <comment4012> The long answer is you can try to use a previous “backup” of your device which usually don’t have the initial password, but the other settings I don’t think they are preserved unencrypted, that’s why I didn’t suggest you that. The best way tho’ it’s to restore.
