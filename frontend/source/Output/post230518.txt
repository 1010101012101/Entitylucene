How to Use Terminal for "Little Snitch" Functionality without Little Snitch <body> I'm a Terminal newb, and trying to wrap my head around manual "Little Snitch" functionality without using Little Snitch.  From the research I've been doing, I've landed on the fact that I need to utilize pf.conf, however I have no idea how to format my request for Terminal.  I need to block a connection to www.domain.com on port 443. How do I do this?  <answer230526> To permanently block outgoing traffic to specific domains you should create a new anchor file and add it to pf.conf.  ol liCreate an anchor file emorg.user.block.out/em in /private/etc/pf.anchors   precodesudo touch /private/etc/pf.anchors/org.user.block.out /code/pre  with the following content and a trailing empty line  precodemybadhosts = "{ www.domain.com, domain.com, www.domain2.com, domain2.com }" mybadports = "{ 443, 80 }"  block drop out proto tcp from any to $mybadhosts port $mybadports /code/pre  The additional domain names in mybadhosts are just an example how to add additional domains. The same goes for port 80 in mybadports.  A simple but less flexible solution is:  precodeblock drop out proto tcp from any to domain.com port 443 /code/pre/li liModify the file /private/etc/pf.conf but keep a trailing empty line  original file:  precodescrub-anchor "com.apple/*" nat-anchor "com.apple/*" rdr-anchor "com.apple/*" dummynet-anchor "com.apple/*" anchor "com.apple/*" load anchor "com.apple" from "/etc/pf.anchors/com.apple" /code/pre  to  precodescrub-anchor "com.apple/*" nat-anchor "com.apple/*" rdr-anchor "com.apple/*" dummynet-anchor "com.apple/*" anchor "com.apple/*" anchor "org.user.block.out" load anchor "com.apple" from "/etc/pf.anchors/com.apple" load anchor "org.user.block.out" from "/etc/pf.anchors/org.user.block.out" /code/pre/li liParse and test your anchor file to make sure there are no errors:  precodesudo pfctl -vnf /etc/pf.anchors/org.user.block.out /code/pre/li liNow modify /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.pfctl.plist from   precode&lt;array&gt;     &lt;string&gt;pfctl&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;string&gt;-f&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;string&gt;/etc/pf.conf&lt;/string&gt; &lt;/array&gt; /code/pre  to  precode&lt;array&gt;     &lt;string&gt;pfctl&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;string&gt;-e&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;string&gt;-f&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;string&gt;/etc/pf.conf&lt;/string&gt; &lt;/array&gt; /code/pre  You have to disable System Integrity Protection to accomplish this. After editing the file reenable SIP. After rebooting your Mac pf will be enabled (that's the -e option).  Alternatively you may create your own launch daemon similar to the answer here: Using Server 5.0.15 to share internet WITHOUT internet sharing./li /ol  After a system update or upgrade some of the original files above may have been replaced and you have to reapply all changes.  <comment353994> my goodness that is a comprehensive answer.
