Blurry icons on Facebook and Google homepage <body> I am using macOS Sierra and recently I observed that the icons and images on Facebook page are all blurry on Chrome. I checked the same on Firefox and Safari and they also load all blurry icons and images.   To rule out that it's not a network issue, I connected my Ubuntu machine to the same network and the images and icons loaded just fine. No blur.  Earlier they were not blurry on Mac but I don't know what changed. I tried clearing cache and also removed Chrome and reinstalled but got the same issue. What could be the reason for this behavior?  Attaching a screenshot below -  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WbXCi.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment357556> Can you please add a screenshot so we can all see what you mean by "blurry". <comment357561> @Little.Eden I have added screenshot of the blurry icons. <comment358002> I'm facing the same issue. Tested in 4 different browsers and all of them the blur occurs. In Chrome I was able to temporarily remove the blur by closing a tab and reopening it with `cmd-shit-t` <comment358040> @Ot√°vio Yes, I tried closing the tab and then opened it pressing `cmd + shift + t`. The blur goes away but as soon as I reload the page by pressing `cmd + r`, it's back to blurry icons. Can't understand why is this happening.
