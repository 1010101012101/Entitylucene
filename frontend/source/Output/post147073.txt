very frequent CPU usage 100% for systemstats <body> I have macbook retina pro 2013 version with 16gb ram and OS X 10.9.3.  This machine works just fine, except just one problem. systemstats hits 100% CPU usage very frequently, at least 6 times a day.  I've cleaned up database file for my spotlight and tried many solutions from google search result.  What is this systemstats and why is it using 100% cpu?
