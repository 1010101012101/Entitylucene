Can I copy the entire scrollback buffer from iTerm2 to the clipboard? <body> I've just run some commands and have several pages of output in iTerm2. Now I'd like to save it somewhere. (I could have piped it to a file, but I didn't think of that.)  Is there an easier way to copy it all to the clipboard that by scrolling back and highlighting for pages?  <answer139196> Oh, right, duh. kbd⌘/kbd + kbdA/kbd to select it all, then kbd⌘/kbd + kbdC/kbd.  <answer139232> You probably know this, but if anyone comes in the future, this works too:  precodehistory &gt; ~/Desktop/history.txt /code/pre  Or some other file of your choice. The file will be overwritten, or you can use  to append.   If you want output as well, the shell command codescript/code works as well to capture while you type (but it captures key presses too, so watch out) or iTerm will have some option to save a session, like the stock Terminal's kbd⌘/kbd + kbdS/kbd.   <comment164168> There is a setting in iTerm 2 that automatically copies anything selected to the clipboard, making the Command-C unnecessary. <comment335622> I did this, but saving a 100M scrollback log through clipboard took iTerm2 about 5 min, and a bit less - to paste it into a text editor. I wish `Cmd-S` saved the buffer directly. <comment346588> pbpaste  ~/Desktop/buffer.log  took milliseconds for 17meg file
