Binding Mac to AD using credentials from another domain in the same forest <body> We have a forest with 2 domains: EU and NA.  I have a workstation admins account in NA and need to be able to join a Mac to the EU domain.  When I enter my NA credentials to try and bind the Mac to EU I get an error 'Authentication server encountered an error while attempting the requested operation'  I've tried prefixing by NA account with the NA domain NA\username but still get the same error. The tickbox for 'Allow authentication from any domain in the forest' is also ticked  I have no problem when adding Windows PCs to the EU domain using my NA credentials, is there something obvious I'm missing?
