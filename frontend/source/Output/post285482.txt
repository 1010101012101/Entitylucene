Keyboard shortcut to trigger the contextual menu? <body> I'm searching for a way in Mac OS to trigger the contextual menu, i.e. the menu triggered by a right-click with your mouse, without having to use the mouse AT ALL, i.e. not even having to position the mouse anywhere.  Many Windows users are lucky enough to have a dedicated key for this!  See...https://help.gnome.org/users/gnome-help/stable/keyboard-key-menu.html.en.  Is there a way to accomplish the equivalent for Mac OS?  Can the Karabiner-Elements keyboard remapping software be used to accomplish this?
