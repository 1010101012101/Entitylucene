Process: kernel_task over 700mb memory <body> Anyone knows how do I solve high memory consumption of the process "kernel_task" ?  I tried to delete .plist files from folder bellow, but the problem still continue  My Mac: Macmini6,1  /System/Library/Extensions/IOPlatformPluginFamily.kext/Contents/PlugIns/ACPI_SMC_PlatformPlugin.kext/Contents/Resources/  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7xAK1.png" alt="process"img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JNkq3.png" alt="finder"  <comment210668> Why did you delete exactly those files? BTW 700 MB memory consumption is completely normal... <comment210670> I have 450 Mb with 2% CPU and it does not bother me! <comment210684> How much RAM do you have in your Mac? And what problem are you trying to solve by reducing the amount of RAM allocated to kernel_task? It is generally a bad idea to randomly mess with files under /System, you could end up with a Mac that can't boot.
