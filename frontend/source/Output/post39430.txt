Automatically scan/cycle through safari tabs? <body> I have a mac mini setup on a tv to monitor our network.  I'd like to setup the monitoring pages we'd like to view in a set of tabs and have safari automatically cycle through them.  Something like how gas stations use to change video feeds; some sort of auto-switcher.  I looked at glims but it doesn't appear to have the functionality.  Is there a way to do this with base safari or does anyone know of a plugin that will do this behavior in Safari?  <answer39501> You can use this block of AppleScript to loop through your tabs on a window:  precodetell application "Safari"     repeat         repeat with i from (count of tabs of window 1) to 1 by -1             set thisTab to tab i of window 1             set current tab of window 1 to thisTab             delay 1         end repeat     end repeat end tell /code/pre  This will go through all your tabs and switch every 1 second.  Just change the delay to change the time before each tab switches.  <comment44580> Does it **have** to be Safari? There's a [plugin for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dlknooajieciikpedpldejhhijacnbda) which does this. <comment44595> I am aware that Chrome and Firefox both have extensions that will handle this, but I was curious if Safari had the ability natively. <comment44634> You can certainly do it in Applescript  The object hierarchy is very simple   - Application  - Windows (Window)  - Tabs (Tab) <comment285165> Use built-in AppleScript Editor to write, save and run it. Works beautifully, thanx!
