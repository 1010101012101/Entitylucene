Plugging MacBook Pro's display assembly onto MacBook Air Logic Board <body> As a temporary replacement, can I plug a MacBook Pro 13" mid 2009's display assembly onto my 13" mid 2011 MacBook Air's logic board?  It is ok if it cannot close, or is not transportable. All I need is to be able to troubleshoot my MacBook Air.   I am wondering :   ol liwhether it will work/li liwhether it can damage either the display or the laptop/li /ol  <answer277429> strongTechnically speaking, it emshould/em work./strong    Even though (according to Everymac.com), the 2009 MBP display has a resolution of 1280x800 and the 2011 MacBook Air has a display of 1400x900 it is capable of a resolution of 1280x800.

With a little research on iFixit.com, you can see that the LVDS connecorts for the MacBook Pro and the MacBook Air are on opposite sides of the logic board  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/n0IOym.jpg" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DlZf9m.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  (Left Image is MacBook Pro and right image is MacBook Air)  So, even though closing and mobility is not a big concern, you would have to at least turn the display the "wrong way round" to just make the connection.  If you do attempt this, I highly advise you to isolate the logic board from any potential shorts by putting a silicone or plastic barrier (think place mat) over the logic board.  <comment349211> Awesomissime, thanks !
