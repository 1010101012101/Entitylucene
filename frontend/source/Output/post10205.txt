Can I change the color of my Mac OS X Terminal window depending on which server I am ssh-ed to? <body> I'd like to have the background as black for server 'foo' but have the background be say gray  or blue for server 'bar'.  I am worried I'll run the wrong command on the wrong ec2 instance because all the pwds are code/home/ubuntu/code! How is everyone else solving this?  <answer10206> you can use a script to connect to your servers, which also changes the bg color of your terminal before it connects.  http://www.macosxhints.ch/index.php?page=2&amp;hintid=1001  <answer10207> Use different bash scripts to launch each session and change the background color depending on the server.  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4404242/programmatically-launch-terminal-app-with-a-specified-command-and-custom-colors  <answer10211> You may use iTerm2 bookmarks, where you can customize each bookmark with its own settings!  <comment10620> Not an exact duplicate, but pretty close. See: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/9740/can-i-tell-iterm-2-to-change-color-when-im-root <comment63660> I want to do this too! In particular, I want the .login on each remote system to send the correct escape sequence to change the background colors. However, when I log out, I want the old colors restored...
