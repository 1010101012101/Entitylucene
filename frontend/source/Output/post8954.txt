Copy photos off iPhone without iPhoto? <body> I have a Mac that doesn't have iPhoto installed on it, which I use for syncing with my iPhone. Is there any way I can copy images from my phone to my Mac (other than email) without purchasing a copy of iPhoto?   <answer8955> strongUse Image Capture./strong You'll find it in your Applications folder. It's surprisingly robust, and it's made by Apple.  <answer9068> You can also use strongPreview/strong, go File - Import from iPhone.  <answer9119> You can also try apps like DropPhox which will sync your pictures to Dropbox as soon as you click them. Very handy!  <comment9553> I have iPhoto on my mac and never purchased it. I always thought it comes along with OS X for free. <comment9602> @Cawas it comes with every mac (ie. pre-installed), but not on the install DVDs <comment9614> @loic well, I rather use **picasa** anyway! ;-P <comment9675> @loic @Cawas there usually is now two DVD's that come with every Mac, the OS install and the Applications install. <comment9678> @jml yes, with every Mac. But when I bought (snow) leopard, it wasn't on them <comment46491> Will this extract video as well? **edit, it will http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4083 <comment215630> great, iPhoto is changing photo size and etc. so this i great solution
