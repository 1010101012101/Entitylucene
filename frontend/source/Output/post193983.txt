Stuck at OS X Utilities while clean installing Yosemite <body> I decided to do a clean Yosemite install on my Macbook Pro 13 inch Mid-2012 . So I made a boot able USB from terminal. Then I booted from it and went into disk utility and erased my current Disk which was Macintosh HD. Then I closed disk utility and clicked install OS X. As soon as I double clicked it the continue button grayed out and nothing is happening. I can move around the cursor which means it hasn't hung. I rebooted to the boot able USB and again clicked it and again the button grayed out. I have been waiting now for about 10 to 15 minutes and nothing has happened yet. What should I do?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qc6ND.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  This is where I am stuck.  <answer210792> This sounds like the install you created is faulty somehow, possibly either a bad file copy or a bad flash drive.  Things to try, in order:  ol liRebuild the install drive using the same method you used before, but on a new drive./li liUse the built-in recovery options (hold kbdcmd/kbd kbdR/kbd) to do the install. Then, upgrade to the latest version of OS X. By upgrading to the newer OSX, your recovery partition will be set to do a clean upgrade of El Capitan if you have to do it again./li liIf that doesn't work (say your recovery partition is trashed), there's the Internet Recovery option, which will actually reinstall the OS your mac shipped with./li /ol
