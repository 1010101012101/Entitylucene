How do I retrieve previous iTunes purchases <body> I wish to download previous iTunes purchases on my iPhone, but there is nothing showing up in my purchases.  When I go direct and search on iTunes for the music I have downloaded it says I have purchased but wont let me re download.  Any ideas?  <answer98651> Generally you can't re-download purchased songs from the iTunes Store, but this link suggests that there might be a way to do it after all.      [...]But first, make absolutely sure that you don’t have any copies,   anywhere. It’s only prudent.      Once you are really sure that those iTunes songs are gone, here’s what   to do:      ol   liOpen the iTunes Store on your device./li   liMake sure you are signed in with the same account used for the original purchase./li   liTap Purchased from the bottom navigation bar./li   liFrom the Purchased tab, tap the artist name for the content you intend to download again./li   liOnce you’ve located the music you are looking for, tap the download button./li   /ol      (If you want to download all songs from an album that you’ve   purchased, click on the button to swith to the “Album” view.)   This may or may not work for you, but it's worth a try.  <answer98675> You can download previous purchases from the App Store, iBooks Store and iTunes store.
