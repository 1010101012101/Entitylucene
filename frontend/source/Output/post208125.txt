How do I open multiple instances of an app? <body> I have a *.app  If I open it, from the dock, or from Finder, it opens. I want to open ANOTHER second running instance.  If I open it, from the dock or from the Finder the second time, now it simply emfocuses/em it.  One Windows and Ubuntu you can simply hold CTRL and click it and a second instance will open. How do I do that on OSX?  NOTE: I tried the codeopen -n/code trick and it doesn't work.  <answer208131> Because OSX is just unix, you can use a terminal to run the original binary that's stored in the *.app directory. Ala  code/Applications/TextEdit.app/Contents/MacOS/TextEdit &amp;/code  Keep in mind some applications use databases to store their data which may cause conflicts or loss of data.  If you don't want to use the terminal, then you can make a shortcut icon that runs this command using the built in strongAutomater/strong app
