How do I find out the hostname of my Mac OS X server? <body> I'm trying to connect with codemysql_connect/code using PHP.  I was wondering how to find the hostname when I turn my MacBook into a server by turning on the personal webpage.   I have Apache, MySQL and PHP enabled.   Is the hostname what you codessh/code into? It says that my computer's name is codespiderman/code and it could be accessed with codespiderman.local/code, but it doesn't seem to work. I've also tried using my IP address.  <answer29724> If you want to connect to MySQL running locally, try 127.0.0.1 or localhost.   <answer29751> In general, you get the hostname by typing  precodeecho $HOSTNAME  /code/pre  in Terminal.  But for your server setup, if no one has messed with configuration, localhost will be the hostname to use; in safe mode, localhost:3306 (that is port 3306) is the default.  (cf. http://php.net/manual/en/function.mysql-connect.php )  BUT: You should make sure that you actually started the MySQL server. Starting command depends on your installation.  <answer32577> It depends if you are doing it from within a script program where the environment has been set up correctly, either the following may work or suit you:  precode~$ uname -n roberts.e.co.za ~$ echo $HOSTNAME roberts.e.co.za /code/pre  <answer214414> In a terminal run the command:  precode$ hostname /code/pre  The environment variable code$HOSTNAME/code may not necessarily be set.  <comment34112> Are you SSHing into the computer from the same local network?
