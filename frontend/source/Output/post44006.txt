How to fix when I can nslookup and dig an internal hostname, but I cannot ping or ssh to the internal machine? <body> I can nslookup and dig an internal hostname, and I get a rapid response, but I cannot ping or ssh to the server.  All external hostnames work fine for both ping, ssh, dig or nslookup.  precodessh -vvv xxxx-xxx-xxxx-1.xxx.xxxx.net OpenSSH_5.6p1, OpenSSL 0.9.8r 8 Feb 2011 debug1: Reading configuration data /Users/gregcain/.ssh/config debug1: Applying options for * debug1: Reading configuration data /etc/ssh_config debug1: Applying options for * debug1: auto-mux: Trying existing master debug1: Control socket "/Users/gregcain/.ssh/master-gregc@xxxx-xxx-xxxx-1.xxx.xxxx.net:22" does not exist debug2: ssh_connect: needpriv 0 ssh: Could not resolve hostname xxxx-xxx-xxxx-1.xxx.xxxx.net: nodename nor servname provided, or not known /code/pre  I've done a lot of searching on the net, and on this site, and it appears it's got something to do with mDNSresponder.   I've added two stanzas to /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.mDNSResponder.plist   precode-AlwaysAppendSearchDomains &lt;- this shouldn't matter, since I am using FQDN.  -NoMulticastAdvertisements &lt;- I believe this one disable bonjour broadcast /code/pre  I've also tried turning off mDNSResponder, but then name resolution fails outright.   If I add entries to /etc/hosts, then I get working name resolution.  But I need to be able to connect to DNS.    I'm pretty confident our DNS is setup correctly, as it works for everyone around me.  I've also spun up a linux VM, and I'm able to connect as I would expect, using the same /etc/hosts and /etc/resolv.conf.    Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

What are the results of pinging the server?  When you run the nslookup you can configure a DNS server to use, and also query which DNS server you're using.  Run nslookup without an argument to get into interactive mode, then enter 'server' to see which DNS server you think you're using. If you have an local authoritative server that's incorrectly setup, you'll fail internally, but work externally which will hit a different DNS server ultimately.  Also, you can check your ARP cache - this will show you the MAC - IP mappings within your subnet. Assuming you're on the same subnet, once you've pinged, you might see something odd in there. (run arp -a for a listing of the ARP cache)  <answer213345> Starting from Lion (except Yosemite between 10.10 and 10.10.3), the command for flushing the DNS cache is:  precode$ sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder /code/pre  There is a solution at https://superuser.com/questions/326848/strange-ns-behavior-on-os-x-cant-connect-to-ssh-server.  <comment50943> ping, like ssh fails.  When I do an nslookup, I see the two servers I expect to see (the ones specified in /etc/hosts.)  Arp has nothing interesting. <comment50957> Yes, but wondering what the ping error is. <comment51171> ping: cannot resolve xxx.yyy.domain.net: Unknown host <comment51324> Can you run nslookup and then "set all" at the nslookup prompt? That should return the domains being queries "srchlist", and the servers being used. <comment51462> Output put in the original question.  Comments can't have code, at least with formatting. <comment51468> *"Neither digg nor nslookup will hit your server, they both query the DNS servers"* Many home routers implement a small DNS server that gives correct information for local hostnames, and passes queries through to the ISP DNS for external hostnames.  This statement depends on how your local network is setup, and I've seen this on even cheap home routers. <comment51658> Do you know which domain server is authoritative for your local domain? And, I assume you can ping and ssh straight to the IP. <comment51660> oh, and can you run scutil --dns and post output
