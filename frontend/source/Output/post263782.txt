Copy file from USB device (camera) to the Desktop <body> I'd like to somehow copy files from a USB device (camera) to my Desktop using BASH commands.  I can see the device listed by running codeioreg -p IOUSB -w0/code, but can't find a way to codecd/code to it or list any files (images, videos) on the camera's internal drive.  <comment330509> If the camera's internal storage is not automatically mounting, where it's visible in `/Volumes`, then you'll need to mount the storage volume first, before you can `cd` to it, to copy files, etc.
