Issues with Unicode symbols in some applications running in Terminal.app and iTerm2 <body> precodeDarwin DeoGloria 13.3.0 Darwin Kernel Version 13.3.0: Tue Jun  3 21:27:35 PDT 2014; root:xnu-2422.110.17~1/RELEASE_X86_64 x86_64 /code/pre  Fresh user account. Terminal.app and iTerm2 with UTF-8 set. Accented characters work fine in all applications ("å,ä,ö,é"). But some (wide?) unicode chars is not showing in some command line applications. I first discovered it in weechat, but in the bash shell it works fine.  In stock Mavericks bash:  precodeDeoGloria:~ test$ echo -e "\xE2\x9A\x91" ⚑ /code/pre  Copying and pasting the flag char with mouse.  precodeDeoGloria:~ test$ ⚑ -bash: ⚑: command not found /code/pre  bash is working as expected. Starting default zsh, no config done  precodeDeoGloria:~ test$ zsh DeoGloria:~ test$ echo -e "\xE2\x9A\x91" ⚑ /code/pre  Showing alright. But not when I paste:  precodeDeoGloria% &lt;2691&gt; zsh: command not found: \u2691 /code/pre  Locale settings:  precodeDeoGloria% locale LANG="sv_SE.UTF-8" LC_COLLATE="sv_SE.UTF-8" LC_CTYPE="sv_SE.UTF-8" LC_MESSAGES="sv_SE.UTF-8" LC_MONETARY="sv_SE.UTF-8" LC_NUMERIC="sv_SE.UTF-8" LC_TIME="sv_SE.UTF-8" LC_ALL= /code/pre  Starting emacs or vi from zsh and pasting "⚑" works fine. It doesn't work in nano. I get an non-visual character.  I suspected some issues with ncurses, but bash, zsh, nano, emacs are all linked with   precode/usr/lib/libncurses.5.4.dylib (compatibility version 5.4.0, current version 5.4.0) /code/pre  I'm out of ideas. Any pointers?  <answer250940> Interesting question! I did some tests on my side.   h3zsh/h3  precodexXx:~/ $ &lt;2691&gt;                                                                                                                                                                                               zsh: command not found: \u2691 xXx:~/ $                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          zsh: command not found:  xXx:~/ $ ℃                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  zsh: command not found: ℃ /code/pre  I did also several tests with other shells and results are not the same:   h3sh/h3  precodesh-3.2$ ⚑ sh: ⚑: command not found /code/pre  h3bash/h3  Ok, that should be the same as codesh/code:  precodebash-3.2$ ⚑ bash: ⚑: command not found /code/pre  h3csh/tcsh/h3  precode[LeBouc-xXx:~] xXx% \U+2691 ⚑: Command not found. /code/pre  hr  Apparently, all that shells are not set with the same input/output options. I tried with xterm/terminal and iTerm2 to see if I could be a software dependant problem. That's the same everywhere.  I don't have the time to search/read that but you might find some useful informations about the zsh line editor here.  If you find it, keep me up-to-date, I would be pleased to have the final answer to your question.  <comment309987> Similar question here, but no complete answer: https://superuser.com/questions/583031/how-can-i-get-zsh-to-display-international-characters-properly
