How do I get rEFInd working with OS X 10.11 El Capitan? <body> I noticed that I could not install and use rEFInd after upgrading to OS X 10.11 El Capitan. This restricts me to OS X so I cannot boot my Linux partition.   I get the following error: codeerror "Could not set boot device property: 0xe00002bc"/code  <answer209273> You must disable System Integrity Projection.   ol liRestart the computer, while booting hold down Command-R to boot into recovery mode./li liOnce booted, navigate to the “Utilities  Terminal” in the top menu bar./li liEnter codecsrutil disable/code in the terminal window and hit the return key./li liRestart the machine and System Integrity Protection will now be disabled./li /ol  source: http://mattjanik.ca/blog/2015/10/01/refind-on-el-capitan/  <answer214924> As an alternative, for example if you (like me) had removed the recovery partition before upgrading to El Capitan (which didn't restore it), boot into your rEFInd USB stick, from there boot into Linux, install your rEFInd Linux package and install rEFInd back into your HD from Linux.  <answer214928> With the release of rEFInd 0.10.0, there's no official rEFInd documentation on this issue:  http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/sip.html  That version's installation script (now called coderefind-install/code) also runs from the Recovery HD, and rEFInd itself can manage SIP settings, which give two more options for how to work around the issue.  <answer220909> http://www.zealpeal.com/dual-boot-os-x-el-capitan-on-macbook-pro-with-kali-linux/ check this full guide on dual booting os x el capitan and installing rEFInd.  <answer247339> I know this is an old question, but I just had to go through this issue when attempting to install rEFInd on a 2015 MBP. When trying to install by running code./refind-install/code in the terminal, I kept getting a message telling me that system integrity protection was enabled, and I could not do an install without rebooting into the recovery volume. The solution without disabling system integrity protection (it's probably there for a good reason):  ol liIn terminal, type codecd ~/Downloads/code/li liDownload the current install file with codecurl -s -L https://sourceforge.net/projects/refind/files/0.10.3/refind-bin-0.10.3.zip/code/li licodeunzip refind-bin-0.10.3.zip/code/li liReboot, holding down codecmd + r/code when the chime sounds/li liOpen utilities - Terminal/li liYour hard drive is no longer accessible at code//code since your on a different partition. Instead, it's now under /Volumes/{name of your hard drive}. If you don't already know what it's called (default is 'Macintosh\ HD'), type codecd /Volumes/code, then codels/code to see it listed there./li liType codecd /Volumes/{name of your hard drive}/Users/{your username}/Downloads/code. For example, mine is codecd /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/Users/Ayden/Downloads/code. Remember to escape all spaces in directory or filenames with '\ ', and use tab for autocompletion./li liType code./refind-install --root /Volumes/{Your hard drive} --yes/code. You should get a successful completion notice./li liReboot. You should see rEFInd. To see the default boot manager, press the option key while booting./li /ol  Note: to see more install options type codevim refind-install/code while in the code~/Downloads/refind-bin-0.10.3/code directory. They are listed at the top. To quit vim, type code:q/code.  <comment267445> Answers on Ask Different need to be more than just a link. It's okay to include a link, but please summarize or excerpt it in the answer. The idea is to make the answer stand alone. <comment278401> I hope this gets more up votes, you definitely deserve it. +1 from me. This question is _rampant_ whenever I help people with dual-booting who have already "upgraded" to El Capitan. <comment325816> Note this method is out of date - there is no need to disable SIP - normal users shouldn't disable SIP - read the manual: http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/sip.html#recovery - or see other answers below (including from Rod himself) <comment341268> I cannot find my directory at all from the recovery start. In /Volumes, I only have the `OSX Startup Disk` and `Untitled`, which I think is the new;y created space on the disk I made using Disc utility
