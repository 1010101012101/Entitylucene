How can I achieve auto mounting AFP shared drives in OS X? <body> I would like to automatically mount remote AFP shared drives.   The ideal solution would be to auto mount the remote drives even before the session was opened.  strongEdit/strong: I currently use login items, but as stated above auto mounting before the session or even without the session starting would be ideal.  Examples would be very appreciated.  <answer44482> You can write a shell script that gets exectued with an AppleScript script.  <answer44483> You can put aliases to the remote volumes in your Login Items folder.  A nice explanation of this feature is available from Apple on the web and the built-in help:  ul lihttp://support.apple.com/kb/ht2602/li /ul  <answer44503> I have a shell script that I run via a launchd plist every few minutes to automount an NAS drive. I use it from home to mount my NAS as it contains our shared iTunes Media folder.  You can look at the script Code on Pastebin.  I you have questions about the code I'll be happy to discuss. It has a lots of error checking etc. Using a shell script and a launchd plist has the benefit if the the mount becomes unmounted for any reason.  <comment50559> Would you provide an example for a setup? <comment50647> I will test that. <comment50648> FYI, in _function mount\_disk_ the syntax for an AFP mount is `mount_afp afp://ip-address/volume-name $vol`
