When copying a directory from one external HDD to another Finder tells there are more files than in the whole HDD <body> I have this problem when trying to copy files from one external HDD to another, the thing is that in the first HDD the Disk Util app says it has 10,702,660 items  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rveMv.png" alt="Disk one information" and when I try to copy them the Finder, is still searching, and at the moment it says 12,692,582 items.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2v9Lr.png" alt="Finder progress"  The problem with these is that the Finder later on tell me that it can't be copied because there isn't enough space on the disk and as you can see the other disk is the same size as the original one and the original isn't even full so it's impossible to not have the space.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dNbOL.png" alt="Disk two informaton" I hope someone can help me because I am unable to copy the files but I need to.  Thanks, Alberto  PS: The information about my Mac  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4uHK1.png" alt="Mac Info"  <comment175663> Do you have any symlinks to a 3rd drive? Maybe it's trying to copy that too.. [pure guesswork] Alternatively, maybe try Carbon Copy Cloner <comment175666> Also any hard links as then the file would be copied many times - although I am less certain re the number , hard link directories as used in Time Machine might do that <comment175706> @Tetsujin I can't use CCC because it's a Time Machine backup so the CCC says it can't copy them, any other suggestion? <comment175707> @Mark how could I resolve the hard links thing? Thanks anyway <comment175711> That comment re Time Machione comment needs to be in the question It is the most important bit - the issue is hard links - search for copying Time Machine questions - this is probably a duplicate <comment175717> possible duplicate of [Is there a faster way to copy time machine files from one disk to another?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/35149/is-there-a-faster-way-to-copy-time-machine-files-from-one-disk-to-another) <comment175718> found duplicate with a CCC page saying it can sort of be done <comment175728> Thanks @Mark, I saw you updated my answer, sorry about that I try my best on searching and on the question itself.
