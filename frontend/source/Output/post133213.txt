How to download additional text-to-speech voices for later installation? <body> I would like to download additional text-to-speech voices for OS X to later install on multiple systems or systems without an internet connection.  Is this possible, or do I have to be online to download them through the System Preferences ?  <answer133216> The downloaded voices are stored in strong/System/Library/Speech/Voices/strong.  You can copy these between Macs. Download the desired voice on one Mac through System Preferences and copy it to the other Macs that you want.  <comment157834> how about the extended version (the 900 meg online file) <comment157835> @Buscar If you mean Enhanced Dictation, that's dictation, not text-to-speech.
