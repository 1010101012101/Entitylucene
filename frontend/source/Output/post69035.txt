Did iMessage beta on Lion finally stop working recently? <body> I tried to send a message using the iMessage beta that I installed on Lion ages ago. The message didn't send, and then I noticed the prompt looked like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/muFtn.png" alt="enter image description here"  I tried to exit iMessage and restart it, but it wouldn't let me log in with the following message after entering my Apple ID:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OTw5T.png" alt="enter image description here"  Did Apple finally forcibly disable iMessage on Lion? Are there any solutions to using iMessage for me now? (I know I could upgrade to Mountain Lion, but I'm curious if there are any alternatives.)  <answer69062> Yes, Apple did disable Messages beta for Lion users.  French blogger from Consomac found the following in the French strings of the beta:      img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gQ13D.jpg" alt="Thank you for participating in the Messages Beta program. With the inclusion of Messages in OS X Mountain Lion, the Messages Beta program has ended. To continue using Messages, please visit the Mac App Store and purchase OS X Mountain Lion."       strongsource/strong http://consomac.fr/news-1339-messages-pas-sur-lion.html   Although this is not the exact error that you are receiving, inevitably it will ask you to move to Mountain Lion now that it has been released.  I encourage the upgrade, and if this problem recurs after you upgrade, try moving code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.imservice.iMessage.plist/code to the desktop and restarting your computer.  You can If this does not work, move it back and edit your question accordingly.  <comment80939> Thanks. I ended up upgrading to Mountain Lion anyway.
