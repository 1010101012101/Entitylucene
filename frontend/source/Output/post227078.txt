Compatibility of Mid 2011 MacBook Air 13" Parts <body> I am replacing the upper case of my MBA 2011 13", I found something on eBay but am unsure on the compatibility, my serial number is, C02GRGLVDJWT.   Link to the part: 13" Apple MacBook Air A1466 Palmrest Upper Top Case 069-8219-A.  Any help will be greatly appreciated.   <answer227104> Possibly, but it's probably not worth betting on it. Instead, buy one such as this that corresponds to your computer.  <answer227127> precodeSerial No: C02GRGLVDJWT Apple MacBook Air i5 1.7 13" (Mid-2011) Part No: MC965LL/A Model Identifier: MacBookAir4,2 Model No: A1369  Apple MacBook Air i7 2.0 13" (Mid-2012) Part No: MD232LL/A Model Identifier: MacBookAir5,2 Model No: A1466 /code/pre  Between these 2 machines, casing parts are strongNOT/strong interchangeable
