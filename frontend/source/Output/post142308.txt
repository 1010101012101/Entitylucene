Issue installing GCC using homebrew (scipy package dependency) <body> I am attempting to install the scipy (Scientific Python, including matplotlib) package using homebrew, and I noticed that it fails when it needs to install a dependency (gcc version 4.9.0).  I attempted to install it on multiple OSX versions, and even a manual method, but the error always occurs at "make bootstrap" portion.  strongFirst method:/strong  pre brew tap Homebrew/versions brew install gcc49 /pre  strongResult:/strong  pre make[4]: *** [all-multi] Error 2 make[3]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1 make[2]: *** [all-stage1-target-libsanitizer] Error 2 make[1]: *** [stage-bubble] Error 2 make: *** [bootstrap] Error 2 /pre  strongSecond Method:/strong  pre wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gcc/gcc-4.9.1/gcc-4.9.1.tar.bz2 gunzip gcc*.bz2 tar -xf gcc*.tar ./configure --prefix=/usr/gcc-4.9.1 --with-gmp=/usr/local/Cellar/gmp/6.0.0a --with-mpr=/usr/local/Cellar/mpfr/3.1.2-p8 --with-mpc=/usr/local/Cellar/mpc/0.26 --program-suffix=4.9.1 --enable-languages=c,c++,fortran --with-system-zlib --enable-stage1-checking --enable-plugin --enable-lto --disable-multilib /pre  strongResult:/strong Similar output to first one at the end of output.  Anyone know how to install this correctly, or do I need to use xcode?  Will that even work with the scipy package installed through homebrew?  strong---------- UPDATE -----------/strong  Tried suggestions.  That is the "brew install gcc" and "brew install scipy"  It fails at installing gcc either way, after doing those commands I get the following.  pre == Installing dependencies for scipy: gcc, numpy == Installing scipy dependency: gcc == Downloading http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/gcc/gcc-4.9.1/gcc-4.9.1.tar.bz2 Already downloaded: /Library/Caches/Homebrew/gcc-4.9.1.tar.bz2 == ../configure --build=x86_64-apple-darwin14.0.0 --prefix=/usr/local/Cellar/gcc/4.9.1 --enable-languages=c,c++,objc,obj-c++,fortran - == make bootstrap mkdir common mkdir common/.deps config.status: executing default commands make[1]: *** [stage2-bubble] Error 2 make: *** [bootstrap] Error 2  READ THIS: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/wiki/troubleshooting  These open issues may also help: gcc: compatibility 10.10 (https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/pull/31466) gcc 4.8.3 bottle has invalid omp.h header (https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/issues/29670) MacOS.(gcc|clang|llvm)_version can return nil (https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/issues/18781) /pre  <answer142317> This worked for me, installing all dependencies including gcc 4.9.1.  precodebrew tap homebrew/python brew install scipy /code/pre  <answer142330> Looks like I solved the problem partially by first installing freetype, then doing pip install matplotlib.  scipy still doesn't install though.  pre brew install freetype pip install matplotlib /pre  Now, when I type gcc --version in the console, I get a reference to Apple LLVM version 6.0 (clang-600.0.45.3).   Hopefully this works for what I need.  <answer143320> It's caused by your new OS X Yosemite, try the following command to install gcc on Yosemite  precode    brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/denji/homebrew/gcc/Library/Formula/gcc.rb /code/pre  <comment167641> Those errors are not sufficient to see - we need the first error - You do need Xcode to compile the gcc package in Homebrew <comment167652> The error message is too terse. And why don't you just install the bottled version `brew install gcc`? <comment167655> No, it seems like when I go to try: br brew install scipy or pip install scipy, I get errors.  It tells me that I need gfortran.  Doing a brew install gfortran then tells me that it comes with gcc and to just do a brew install gcc.  Dead end! <comment167663> Are you trying to install on Yosemite?
