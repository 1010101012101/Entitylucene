Resume Conversion <body> I recently had an issue with BootCamp where I had to revert the type of a partition from coreStorage to standard. However, I accidentally exited the terminal while it was reverting.   It currently returns an error that the conversion progress is currently paused (-6950). I have no idea how to resume it. All of this is from the terminal.   <comment357527> Please add the output of `diskutil cs list`.
