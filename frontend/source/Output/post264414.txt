SMB Mount directory and reconnecting <body> I have some trouble with fileserver shares, if the share get's disconnected and reconnected again. The mount dir, e.g. code/Volumes/Data/code isn't removed and when the share get's reconnected again, a new directory code/Volumes/Data-1/code is created.  However, I need the mount to be available at a static path, so that I can use it in some tools.  <answer264626> I fixed the issue using codeautomount/code     sudo mkdir -p /mnt/scan      sudo echo "/mnt/scan      auto_scan"  /etc/auto_master      sudo echo "scansnap -fstype=smbfs ://MYUSER:MYPASS@192.168.1.2/scan/scansnap"     /etc/auto_scan      sudo chmod 600 /etc/auto_scan      sudo automount -vc      ls -la /mnt/scan/scansnap
