GPS not working properly on iPhone: it knows where it is but app can't recognize it <body> My iPhone 6 GPS sometimes just does not work properly. I might be using Waze or Google Maps, but it just looks like it's lost. It knows where it is, because it can follow my position on the map, but the application seems like it can't fully recognize its position and usually just says it's looking for GPS signal (well, sometimes it gets crazy too and goes back all the way to my starting point back and forth).  Does anyone know what may be causing this?  The only thing I suspect is sometimes I have a very low available space on my device, but I'm not totally sure and would sure like to find out how to fix this annoying behavior.
