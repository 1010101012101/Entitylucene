iTunes: get selected mobile apps with AppleScript <body> I fear I already know the answer to this one, but is there any way to access the locally-stored Mobile Applications in an iTunes library using AppleScript?  The codeselection/code property appears to not function with apps:  precodetell application "iTunes" to get selection /code/pre  With, say, a podcast, I get a result like:  precode{file track id 656 of user playlist id 541 of source id 74 of application "iTunes"} /code/pre  But with an app selected, I just get:  precode{} /code/pre  Alternatively, is there a 'rawer' way to access the mobile applications? Merely enumerating them in the file system won't suffice, because I'm trying to change their file location in the iTunes library.  <answer145153> If you want raw. You could try:  precodeactivate application "iTunes"  tell application "System Events"     tell process "iTunes"         keystroke "i" using command down -- open the info window         set theName to title of window 1 -- get the name         keystroke "." using command down  --close the info window     end tell end tell log theName /code/pre  This will get the name of the selected app  I have 170 apps so if I selected the first one and then run  precodeset the logList to {} activate application "iTunes" repeat 170 times     tell application "System Events"         tell process "iTunes"             keystroke "i" using command down -- open the info window             set theName to title of window 1 -- get the name             keystroke "." using command down --close the  info window         end tell         copy theName to end of logList          --DO OTHER SOME STUFF          key code 124     end tell  end repeat  count of logList /code/pre  I can walk through them via the script and get each name. I did not seem to need a delay in it .
