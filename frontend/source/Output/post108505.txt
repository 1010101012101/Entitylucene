How to begin a document numbering with a number other than 1? <body> I'm making a large document in separate docs. I want to number the second doc from 21 on. It will only allow me to start at 1. Any fixes?  <answer108526> On strongPages '13/strong :   ul liGo on Setup (Top right corner) /li liSection thumb/li liStart at '21' /li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2lmYF.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  On strongPages '09/strong :   ul liShow inspector /li li2nd thumb/li liSection /li liStart at '21' /li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2JF02.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment127209> Which Pages version?
