Trying to identify a locked up iMac <body> I've got an old iMac sitting around, no one remembers the password to log into it so we are trying to erase the hard drive to setup a new OS. First I got to identify the model though. It would be great if someone could help me with that, I attached an image of what is written on the bottom of the iMac.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/llpcb.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer256111> EveryMac has a fabulous utility on their site to identify any Mac from its Serial Number or other identifying marks.  In this case, it looks like you have a Late 2006 iMac Core2Duo 2.6GHz 24"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8c3Lz.png" alt="enter image description here"  If you don't have the original install disks, then your best bet would be to buy Snow Leopard directly from Apple. The latest OS the machine can run is Lion 10.7.5, but that is a download only. You'd need 10.6 first.
