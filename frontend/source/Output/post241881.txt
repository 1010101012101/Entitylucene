4K monitor on a non-retina mid-2012 Macbook Pro <body> I am planning on buying a 4K monitor. I currently have a mid-2012 Non-retina Macbook Pro. I know I won't be able to run on the 4K monitor full-res. I don't mind. I was thinking of using SwitchRes (a software that allows you to scale up and down your mac resolution), to run in 2K resolution on that 4K monitor.  Would it work? Will I be able to run at around 60hz in 2K resolution on a 4K monitor?  The reason I'm not buying a 2k monitor, is that I'm planning on upgrading my computer in 1 or 2 year. And that computer will have a better graphic card and compatibility with 4K displays, so I'm thinking long term here.  But I need to know if I can do what I'm planning with my current macbook pro and that 4K monitor, or if it won't work.  Thanks a lot!  <answer242605> I tried to watch a 4k resolution movie on the same model MB Pro non-Retina you've got. There's no chance to watch it smoothly. I also tried to send it to an 2k display which I've got at home.  I'm  going to try out the one at my family's place which has 4k capability  <comment297299> Technically it's not supported, but I don't know if that means it won't work. https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT206587. I also don't know if you could just send a lower resolution to the 4K screen and it would work. But Apple does not support your computer with a 4K screen <comment297342> Thanks Noah. Still wondering if that would work since I'm not sure I wanna buy a 4K Monitor anymore. It does not seem very clear wether it's possible or not. Maybe buying one, trying it out and returning the monitor if that doesn't work would be the best thing to do. <comment297536> I'd take your laptop and a cord and go to a store that sells 4K monitors and see if they'll let you test it out <comment297557> I'll try that out. Thanks! If anyone else knows it this would work, let me know! <comment298502> Well obviously a 4K video on a not even 1080p screen won't look as good. Tell me if you can use that 4K monitor once you know ;) Thanks <comment356232> According to the interwebs it will work but you may not like the result depending on the monitor, but @NoahL has the right idea. You may find you like the result a lot better by simply getting a 1080p monitor at a great price.
