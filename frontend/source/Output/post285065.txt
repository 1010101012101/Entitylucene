How to delete folders in my local iCloud Drive folder <body> In my local iCloud Drive folder I have a lot of unused folders from old iPhone apps. But I am not able to delete these folders. Even coderm -rf/code does not delete the folders. The folder is in:  precode~/Library/Mobile Documents /code/pre  Any idea?  <answer285083> What I do is to logon to my iCloud account. Open the iCloud Drive and find the file/folder I want to delete. At the top of the iCloud window is a trash can. I select the item I want to delete and then click the trash can icon. I get a small box asking me if I really want to delete the item. Just reply yes. Hope this was clear.  <comment359598> Do you mean from the Finder? The folders I am talking about are not visible, even if you use, to see invisible folders.
