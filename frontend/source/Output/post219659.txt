Remove "move to dropbox" menu in Finder <body> I want to remove the annoying "move to dropbox" entry in the menu when I right click a file in Finder.   I can turn off Finder extension all together but I do like the green check marks. I just don't want the clutter up the menu screen.   Is there a way to do this?   <answer219661> This is called a "Finder Service"  http://osxdaily.com/2013/05/14/remove-services-contextual-menu-mac-os-x/     strongRemoving Services from the Contextual Menus/strong      To be clear, this removes items, but does not delete the service itself, meaning you can easily go back and re-enable them again should you decide to reverse this and want a service or two back again.      ol   liLocate the precise name of the service to remove by summoning the contextual menu from the Finder, in this example we’ll right-click a file and want to remove the “Make Contact Sheet” option from the menu list/li   liOpen System Preferences, found within the  Apple menu, and choose “Keyboard” from the preference panel options/li   liChoose the “Keyboard Shortcuts” tab, then click on the “Services” option from the left sides options/li   liNavigate through this list to find the exact name of the service you found in the first step, then uncheck the box next to it/li   /ol   <comment265771> No, this is not a service, it's an entry in the middle, not the bottom
