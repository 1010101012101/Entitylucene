MacBook Pro USB-C adapter and regular USB devices compatibility <body> I got a new MacBook Pro from late 2016, MacOS Sierra, 2 thunderbolt 3 ports.  In this machine I need to plug in one external monitor via HDMI, and a few USB devices (mouse and keyboards). For this I bought an adapter that plugs in to the Mac's USB-C port, and supplies two USB 3.1 ports, one HDMI port and a power delivery for the USB-C power supply. The adapter is: Promate uniHub-C (https://www.promate.net/products/unihub-c)  The power supply works, when I plug in the power cable to the adapter, the computer charges.  The HDMI works with another monitor.  Here is the problem: the USB slots doesn't seem to do much. When I plug in mouse and keyboard in the adapter, nothing happens. I was worried that perhaps I need another kind of USB-C = USB 3 adapter for regular USB devices to work, but I can't confirm that.  My external USB hard drive works, so the mouse/keyboard issue feels strange.  Any ideas? Many thanks.  strongEdit/strong  When I have a USB keyboard plugged in, and an external hard drive - the System Report  USB shows as follows. The keyboard and the hard drive are both plugged in to the uniHub-C.  In the finder I see the hard drive though, seems to work well.  emScreenshot showing the System report/em img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ORxNs.png" alt="System report"  emScreenshot showing that the finder can find the connected hard drive/em img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/65CFN.png" alt="My Passport is found"  <answer293568> It looks like this particular product (uniHub-C) has its own idea about compliance to USB specifications. The designers seem to cut off the USB 2.0 part of the VIA hub design. First sign is that their marketing blurb doesn't mention support for legacy (HS, FS, LS) devices, which is strange - in marketing, more is merrier. Second, the web page shows some goofy "USB Super-fast" logo, which in no way corresponds to the official USB-IF certification logo,  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/31PBU.png" alt="enter image description here"  I suspect you fall for a wrong device.  <comment367993> What does System Report show under USB when using the adapter? - In generel, no further adapter should be necessary for connecting a USB mouse/keyboard. <comment367998> I added this info in the edit now, I'm not sure if this is expected output. <comment368015> How is the hard drive connected? - Via the uniHub-C? The output you have from System Report does not show the hard drive, so it seems you haven't copied the output correctly? <comment368081> The uniHub is connected to the laptop's thunderbolt-3 socket, the hard drive and the keyboard are connected to the uniHub. The uniHub is also connected to the wall socket for power, and to a monitor via HDMI. I updated the question with some screenshots. <comment370420> Is your external HDD a USB3, or USB2 device? <comment370531> Have you tried contacting the manufacturer?  It sounds like a defect in the USB hub. <comment370618> This is concerning indeed. My hard drive is probably USB3, it's a MyPassport. So you think that USB2 protocols doesn't work with the uniHub but since the hard drive is USB3, that's the reason that one shows up? <comment370623> Allan, I have not - but I will definitely contact them now. <comment370624> Ali Chen, the drive is compatible with either USB2 or 3. <comment370682> @miphe, why don't you try any known good USB 2.0 pen drive in your hub? I am sure you have several on them in your drawer... <comment371156> I have confirmed that this is the case. I purchased a USB-C = USB 2.0 HUB/Adapter (http://tinyurl.com/y79emk4j) and the components that didn't work with the Promate HUB does indeed work with this one. Thank you. <comment371226> Just to be clear, a USB3 device is called "USB3 device". This includes backwards compatibility with USB2 as it has a nearly SEPARATE USB2 interface. But in USB3 devices the USB3 interface has a priority. A USB2 device doesn't have USB3 wires. Therefore it is incorrect to say "either USB2 or 3", it is not "either". However, you can force any USB3 device into USB2 mode by using a USB2-only cable - the u-B USB2 plug is compatible with u-B USB3 connector.
