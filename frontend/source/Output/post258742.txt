/bin/bash not executing any commands <body> I set code/bin/bash/code as my default shell like this:  precodechsh -s /bin/bash /code/pre  But it doesn't work when I open a new terminal tab. If you type any command, e.g. codels/code, no output is printed.  Likewise if I simply run code/bin/bash/code from a working shell it behaves the same way.  My current shell is code/bin/sh/code.  I'm trying to change my shell to bash because the current shell (code/bin/sh/code) doesn't execute neither code~/.bashrc/code nor code~/.bash_profile/code for some reason, although it appears to be bash too:  precode$ /bin/sh --version GNU bash, version 3.2.57(1)-release (x86_64-apple-darwin16) Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc /code/pre  I used to use zsh together with oh-my-zsh but it was unacceptably slow, so I'm switching back.  I used bash before that. Both of those files I mentioned were executing at that time (I didn't change the configuration).  <answer258857> I have found the culprit:  precodeif [ -f $(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion ]; then   source $(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion fi /code/pre  These lines in my ~/.bashrc were causing bash to hang up on startup and it wasn't executing any commands as a result. Commenting them out solved the issue.  Apparently, there is some error in that script (it's part of Homebrew's codebash-completion/code package).  <comment323528> what happens if you use /bin/ls ? <comment323529> @fd0 Nothing, same as if I run `ls`.
