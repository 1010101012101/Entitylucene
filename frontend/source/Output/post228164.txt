Is there a way to use update command to locate files on OS X without having to run updatedb manually? <body> I am considering using an alias for locate, as I find really inconvenient to have to run updatedb so often on mac.  Do you have any ideas or workarounds for this?  <answer228170> If you want locate to update more frequently, you have to modify the code/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.locate.plist/code file.  Specifically, you want to find the code&lt;key&gt;StartCalendarInterval&lt;/key&gt;/code section and modify it to your specifications.  By default, locate is configured to update at 3:15am every Saturday (Sunday being the first day staring with 0).  precode&lt;key&gt;StartCalendarInterval&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;dict&gt;                 &lt;key&gt;Hour&lt;/key&gt;                 &lt;integer&gt;3&lt;/integer&gt;                 &lt;key&gt;Minute&lt;/key&gt;                 &lt;integer&gt;15&lt;/integer&gt;                 &lt;key&gt;Weekday&lt;/key&gt;                 &lt;integer&gt;6&lt;/integer&gt;         &lt;/dict&gt; /code/pre  This works like cron, so you can specify an asterisk if you want, for example to run it every day.  Just change the code6/code to and code*/code and it will run at 3:15 every day.  An easier way to do this if you want to have it run at a set interval, for example, every 3 hours, you can use the codeStartInterval &lt;integer&gt;/code directive.  So, for your task to run every three hours insert the following directive into the plist file:  precode&lt;key StartInterval&lt;/key&gt;    &lt;integer&gt;108000&lt;/integer&gt; /code/pre  The integer is the number of seconds.  So, 60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour and so forth.  Don't forget to remove the codeStartCalendarInterval/code directive.  Last, but definitely not least...make a backup copy of your .plist file before modifying it.  This way, if you hose things up, you have a good config to fall back on.  strongNote:/strong  In order to make these changes work under OS X El Capitan, you need to disable OS X's System Integrity Protection (SIP).  You can ONLY do that by using codecsrutil/code in system Recovery Mode.  Boot Mac in System Recovery by holding kbdCommand/kbd+kbdR/kbd.  Using Terminal, enter codecsrutil disable/code  You should see the following: codeSuccessfully disabled System Integrity Protection.  Please restart machine for changes to take effect./code  Reboot.  codelocate/code should now update per your schedule.  Disclaimer:  strongemThis is not a recommended procedure./em/strong  While this answer technically does address the question, it doesn't cover the em"Why is this necessary to alter the updatedb schedule?"/em question.  <answer228172> Locate always consults a database that is either out of date, periodically updated or not created in the first place by default.  On OS X, you would be better off using codemdfind/code which uses the spotlight database and is updated constantly. You can even start a live codemdfind/code query and when another process creates a file that matches your search criteria - the result will arrive nearly instantly.  Changing your alias to use codemdfind/code instead of codelocate/code allows you to work around the design limitations of codelocate/code and the codefind/code command it uses to crawl the filesystem.  <answer244248> codelocate/code's database is by default only updated weekly. Changing its schedule needs disabling SIP, as already explained, which means disabling security mechanisms put there for your protection. Not recommended. Also, codelocate/code seems to only find "public" files - so, not the files under your home directory.  codemdfind/code will rather only find things that a Spotlight search finds. For example, it seems to miss files inside of file bundles. And it's somewhere between inconvenient, imprecise and useless if you only want to find based on filenames.  The last, but classic, option is to use the codefind/code command in terminal. It has lots of options, so better check codeman find/code. But the basic, locate-like usage is simple: codefind &lt;root directory for search&gt; -iname &lt;filename_with_wildcards&gt;/code. It will probably be slow (depending on how big is the part of the filesystem tree where you are searching), but it shows you the current state of the filesystem, as seen by the current user. So, run it with sudo and you'll search all the files in the system.  And if you want to find without dropping to the Terminal level, you can try the freeware EasyFind by Devon Techonologies. Works well.  <comment278141> Does it have to be `locate`? Have You seen `mdfind` ? <comment278144> Can you expand more?  Using Yosemite and Finder, files and locations are updated almost instantaneously so I have no frame of reference to your question. <comment278149> @Allan from `man locate` - `The database is recomputed periodically (usually weekly or daily), and contains the path-      names of all files which are publicly accessible.` <comment278159> What about SIP in `System/Library/LaunchDaemons` ? <comment278165> While the OP didn't state what version of OS X he's running nonetheless Mateusz Szlosek brought up a valid point.  So you might want to add info about SIP and disabling/enabling it. <comment278171> That's true...I forgot about System Integrity Protection.  I will update my answer. <comment278190> mdfind does still miss some hidden and system files in my experience, even when you give it the tortuous arguments to include them in the results.
