"Send" in Mail on Touch Bar seems less sensitive <body> I've been using Mail on my MPB (late 2016) with Touch Bar, and the Send "button" on the Touch Bar seems to require a significantly more thorough press to register; I usually have to press it a second time in order to actually send the message.  Is this intentional (to give you more time to think and reflect before sending) or is it my mind playing tricks?
