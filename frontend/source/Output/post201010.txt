Mounted image appears empty in Finder <body> I decided to reinstall MacOS X from scratch.  I have rebooted my mac with kbdCmd/kbd+kbdR/kbd, then used Disk Utility to create a code.dmg/code disk image on a USB drive.  I then rebooted the computer and verified that I could mount the disk image. It took some time to verify it (250 GB), but it finally mounted fine and I could see that all files were there.  I then rebooted with kbdCmd/kbd+kbdR/kbd again, formatted the internal hard drive, and reinstalled MacOS 10.10.  Now when I reconnect the USB drive and remount the disk image (skipping the verification), although kbdCmd/kbd+kbdI/kbd says that it's almost full (2 out of 250 GB left), it seems to only contain a handful of empty folders: Application, Library, System, Users.  Using Finder, it's just as if all my data was lost.  However when using Terminal, I can browse the entire drive: all the files are there, and I am able to copy them back to my internal drive using codecp/code.  strongWhy does Finder show empty directories?/strong Is this a consequence of skipping disk verification?  <comment242301> Finder display is asynchronous, and sometimes a folder image refresh slides so far down the priority queue that it disappears. Try restarting Finder (cmd opt esc for dialog). <comment242302> I have restarted the mac entirely, but same result! <comment242305> Restarting Mac brings up all network devices as well. A Finder restart alone *may* give you different results. In my experience, the whole thing is kind of dodgy, which is why this is a comment rather than an answer. <comment303208> Restarting finder did help me (could not see contents of DMGs and some folders, event though those were on my internal SSD).
