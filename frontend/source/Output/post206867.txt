Bluetooth not available - keyboard and touchpad unresponsive <body> MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Late 2012) Yosemite 10.10.5  Hi, I have researched this problem without any luck. My problem is that my bluetooth becomes unavailable, and when this happens the keyboard and trackpad becomes unresponsive. 80% of the time for the last 3 days this problem is current, but sometimes everything works fine without me doing anything in particular. strongThe power button is the only one working./strong  Sometimes when it stops working I noticed that my computer starts searching for a bluetooth keyboard. When the problem occur I can't access bluetooth settings.    I have tried the following solutions without luck;  ul liRepaired disk utilitys/li liResetting PRAM, NVRAM and SCM/li liTurned of settings in facetime (apparently this worked for some)/li liDeleting emcom.apple.Bluetooth.plist/em/li /ul  Is it possible that this problem is hardware related? Do you think the problem will remain if I do a total reset of the computer?  I hope this competent community have som answers for me since I am getting crazy over this problem. Thank you!   /D  <comment275935> I have this same issue however I've only noticed this when I'd upgraded to El Capitan. I've reimaged my 2015 Macbook Pro Retina to have a clean install of El Capitan with no success in resolution of this issue. What I'm now going to try is downgrading back to Yosemite.
