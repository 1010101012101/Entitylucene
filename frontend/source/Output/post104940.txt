Copy file from Debian to Mac OS X or Windows <body> I'm new to Linux. How can I copy a file or directory from the Debian OS to Mac or Windows?  <answer104946> You can share filesystems across these platforms but this requires some basic network/sharing configuration on all involved systems.  h2Sharing via Filesystems/h2  On OS X you can enable File Sharing in System Preferences - Sharing  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1iWeh.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  By default only AFP sharing is enabled which may not be available in a standard Linux setup (and definitively is not available on Windows). To also enable Samba/Windows sharing, click on "Options..." and enable Samba sharing there.  h2Sharing via Syncing solution/h2  An alternative and rather easy approach would be to install either Dropbox or BitTorrent Sync on all systems and use this to copy data over.  h2Copying with codescp/code/h2  In case you only want to copy some files you might also be able to use codescp/code to copy files from/to a remote system over a network. Basic syntax is  precodescp local-file remote-user@remote-host: /code/pre  and you will be prompted to enter the password of coderemote-user/code.
