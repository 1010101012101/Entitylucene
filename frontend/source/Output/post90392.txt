Disable line wrapping for output in the Terminal <body> I often read outputs in the terminal that get wrapped as they are too long. Since there is no way that I can modify the printed output, I need to let the Terminal allow for horizontal scrolling.  Is there a modification I can make to the default OS X Terminal to strongdisable line wrapping/strong and allow for stronghorizontal scrolling/strong?  Or do you know another alternative I can use?  <answer90411> iTerm 2 doesn't seem to support disabling line wrap either. You might just use less or cut though:  precodeless /var/log/system.log expand /var/log/system.log | cut -c 1-$COLUMNS less -s &lt;&lt;&lt; "$(osascript -e 'tell app "Terminal" to contents of window 1')" /code/pre  <answer92452> Depending on what you are trying to stop wrapping you could use vim.  So launch vim on the file with the long lines, and then type:  precode:se nowrap /code/pre  <answer92454> If you are (as others suggest as a solution, although I think you asked about direct output) then redirect output to a somename.log file and open it with ApplicationsUtilitiesLog-Viewer (or from commandline as  codeopen somename.log/code).    It's not in the terminal but I found the log viewer to the one best suited to deal with large amount of output (searching, scrolling, filtering).  <answer190849> Pipe the output through strongcodeless -S/code/strong:  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"code   -S or --chop-long-lines           Causes lines longer than the screen width to be chopped (truncated)           rather than wrapped.  That is, the portion of a long line that does           not fit in the screen width is not shown.  The default is  to  wrap           long lines; that is, display the remainder on the next line. /code/pre  I tried to explain what might be going on here, though this won't result in a way to scroll horizontally with a scrollbar, as you seem to want.  <answer210666> tput did the trick for me:  precodetput rmam /code/pre  disables line wrapping.  precodetput smam /code/pre  enables line wrapping.  <comment108442> This won't help, since I'm not reading files. I'm reading network information via lsof. <comment108443> I think you mean the `Console.app`, right? There is no `Log Viewer.app` in the Utilities. However, the console also wraps, the only difference is that long lines are contracted by default. You have to click them to read everything - so, this won't help unfortunately. <comment193778> Old question, but seems to me that it is still unresolved. I am in need for the same answer, since for me i cannot further edit the output of for example GCC: https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Language-Independent-Options.html With the flag ```-fmessage-length=0``` set, i still get multi-line warning/error output. and I don't (for now). <comment255953> +1 but any way to add horizontal scrolling too? <comment255978> Arrow keys work for me to horizontally go to the next screen. <comment273465> I don't see how to use the arrow keys... they don't work for me. This solution seems to just truncate the lines to the width of the current window. When I make the window bigger there is just empty space to the right of lines that I know contain more characters. Still, this solution is useful for my purposes since I'm displaying logs and the information on the far right is inconsequential at the moment. <comment286857> nice find! added myself a couple of memorable zsh aliases:  `alias wrapon='tput rmam'` & `alias wrapoff='tput smam'`
