Zooming in macOS iBooks <body> I am reading an code.ibooks/code file which I downloaded from the iBooks Store in the macOS iBooks app. On iOS, to zoom in on the text you can simply double tap or use a pinch gesture. However, it doesn't seem like you can zoom in on an iBook in macOS iBooks with those same gestures on the trackpad. Choosing strongWindow  Zoom/strong only affects the size of the window, and unfortunately not the size of the text.  So, is there any way to zoom in on a book in macOS iBooks?  <answer294436> It's not natively supported in the iBook app to zoom or change text size of code.ibooks/code files  However I found a way to zoom in. It's maybe not the most elegant solution. But it can be very useful. I also suggest you play with the Zoom settings to get the mode that's best for you.  ol liChoose Apple menu  System Preferences, click Accessibility, and then click Zoom./li liSelect “Use keyboard shortcuts to zoom.”/li liul liTo zoom in use kbdalt/kbd + kbdcmd/kbd + kbd=/kbd/li liTo zoom out use kbdalt/kbd + kbdcmd/kbd + kbd-/kbd/li /ul/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uK0oP.png" alt="Accessibility &gt; Zoom"  <comment371645> This iBook doesn't seem to have an option for that. Remember – it's an `.ibook` file, not an `.epub` <comment371652> So I've edit my answer. I overlooked the fact that it was an .ibooks file. <comment371665> Okay :/ I guess that's how it'll go. I've tried converting the file to a PDF to read it much more easily, but it seems like there aren't any good converters out there. I could take screenshots but that's not elegant IMO
