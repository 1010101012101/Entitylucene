Remapping the way that I switch betweens spaces <body> I'm a former Linux user who just switched to a new mbp and I've got a spaces question.    On my linux box I could remap the keys that would move left and right between virtual desktops (spaces).    Is there a way to remap the keyboard in OSX?  Specificlly I'd like to be able to move to the space on the left of the current one with code CMD + H/code and move to the space to the right of me with codeCMD + L/code.  How can I do this?

You don't reassign the kbd⌘/kbd-keys on a Mac. Many of their assignments were declared as sacred ages ago.  kbd⌘H/kbd is used to hide an application — something very useful in a multiple document interface. kbd⌘L/kbd is one of the few that don't have a reserved function. (AHIG Keyboard Shortcuts Quick Reference.) Still, it's used commonly for actions like focusing the location bar in the browser.  As for the actual question, HyperSpaces has customizable shortcuts. It also has emSend window to next / previous space/em, which is missing from normal Spaces.  <answer9785> Apple  System Preferences  Expose&amp;Spaces / Spaces Bottom half of the window Apple  System Preferences  Keyboard  Keyboard Shortcuts  While it IS possible, it's not suggested. You might be a lil hard pressed to find a solution. Go for a 3 finger combo?  <comment10283> possible duplicate: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3880/custom-keyboard-shortcuts-to-change-active-spaces-desktop <comment10284> It is easy to move windows between spaces. Click and hold the title bar and either press the key combo to change spaces, or drag the window to the edge of the screen and hold it there for a little bit. <comment10411> I didn't know about using the shortcuts while dragging the window. Still, having a dedicated shortcut is even more convenient.
