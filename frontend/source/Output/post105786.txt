Esc button on an iPad <body> Hi i was doing a report and went on google drive and accidently clicked on full screen and it said I needed to click kbdesc/kbd to get out of full screen.   I was just wondering where the kbdesc/kbd button on an iPad is, because I can't find it and I need to insert a picture and I can't and it won't let me copy and paste.  <answer105828> As @daniel-lawson says, there is no escape key on iPad.   Furthermore, I tried connecting my Apple Wireless keyboard to my iPad via bluetooth. I went  on Google Docs (desktop version) and went fullscreen. The escape key on the keyboard is not recognized.   We can assume iOS has not support for that kind of key yet.   <answer106295> Well, there is no ESC key. but the homebutton on the middle bottom of the ipad functions about the same as the ESC key...  <comment124367> It appears that there *is* no escape button on an iPad. <comment124419> Isn't there an [app you could be using instead](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-drive/id507874739)? This would mean the website isn't really iOS compatible. <comment140674> Need to find esc or equivalent
