Access OS X Mail message by its ID <body> I am trying (unsuccessfully) to get a Mail message (located in the 'Drafts' folder) by its message id.  The following code:  precodeset theContent to getContent(123456)  on getContent(theID)    tell application "Mail"            try       return ((content of message whose message id is theID) as rich text)     on error errText number errNum       display dialog "Error: " &amp; errNum &amp; return &amp; errText     end try    end tell  end getContent /code/pre  Generates an error that reads: codeError -1723.  Can't get the content of message whose message id = 123456.  Access not allowed./code  What am I missing?  <answer101544> Try:  precodetell application "Mail" to get content of (first message of drafts mailbox whose id = 123456) /code/pre  <comment154620> It's not AppleScript, but if you just want to see the message, you can pull it up by opening the URL `message://YOUR-MESSAGE-ID@HERE`.
