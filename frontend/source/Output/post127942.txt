Use Built-In Microphone as Input and EarPods as Output <body> I am trying to record singing in Logic Pro X. I have a background track that I want the signer to be able to hear through EarPods or Beats. However, I don't want to use the microphone that comes with them; I want to use the internal microphone.  Here's System Preferences with the EarPods in: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mm0RN.png" alt="enter image description here"  As you can see, the only options are the microphone on the EarPods and the empty Line In port (I have an older MacBook Pro).  Without the EarPods, I get what I want: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WgLn5.png" alt="enter image description here"  How can I use the Internal microphone with EarPods in?  <answer127999> Have you already tried to use either codeLine In/code or codeBoomDevice/code for recording with your EarPods? That worked for me.   <comment149995> `Line In` is for the separate input on this Mac (Early 2011). `BoomDevice` is used by the application `Boom` to boost the output volume.
