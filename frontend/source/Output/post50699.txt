Can one access the iTunes Store Wish List via either of the two iOS app stores? <body> I use the "My Wish List" feature in the iTunes Store to keep track of music, movies, and apps that I discover via various RSS feeds, curating them for later purchase. Can I view my "Wish List" in either the "App Store" or "iTunes" apps in iOS? If so, where can this feature be found?  <answer97949> Not at the moment, but when iOS 7 is released later, the wishlist feature will be available using a button in the corner of the app (source)  <comment58124> Wait, there's a wish list function?!?!  Thanks, I had *no* idea... <comment58125> @stuffe Yeah. It's in the "Quick Links" sidebar on the right, when you're on your iTunes Store home page. When you click and hold the down-triangle near a potential purchase, "Add To Wish List" comes up as an option along with "Like," "Post," "Gift This Song," et cetera.
