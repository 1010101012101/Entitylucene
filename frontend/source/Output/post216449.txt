How to make a demo video using a Mac? <body> How can a simple demonstration video like this be made using a Mac?  In particular, I need:  ol liTo edit and cut some of the raw materials, as some of it may not be very interesting to the audience./li liAdd some words in the video./li /ol  Could anyone can give me some help?  <answer216451> The beginning of the video shows the paper title. A simple Google search would lead you to http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?reload=true&amp;arnumber=7203040, which is the paper describing the tool.   It is usual in papers describing software to offer a download link in the paper, so I would suggest buying the paper. If there isn't a link inside, or it's not OSX compatible, you could then write your own version based on the description in the paper.  Edit: misinterpreted the question. To record the screen, you can use quicktime then a video editor to add annotations etc.  <comment261570> Hi, thank you for your answer, but what I am asking is *how to make the demo video like they did*. Are there any tools on MAC can do this? I think `quicktime` might not provide sufficient functionality. <comment261572> Misinterpreted the question.
