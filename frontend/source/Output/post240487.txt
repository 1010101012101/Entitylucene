Can't delete file with strange characters in name <body> I have an old file named codeˇ¡␀␀ˇ¡␀␀␀"9 ␀"9/code which is not deleted when I empty the trash. I have tried renaming it but it does not accept any changes. Using the Terminal didn't work either so far:  precodeMac-Pro:deletethisfolder me$ find . -inum 425884608 -delete find: -delete: rmdir(./ˇ¡␀␀ˇ¡␀␀␀"9\006␀"9): Invalid argument /code/pre  what can I do? Thanks!  <comment295582> What about `find . -inum 425884608 -exec rm -fir {} \;`? <comment295599> I tried this but it didn't work either:  `$find . -inum 425884608 -exec rm -fir {} \;` `examine files in directory ./ˇ¡␀␀ˇ¡␀␀␀"9␀"9?`  `$ rmdir ˇ¡␀␀ˇ¡␀␀␀\"9^F␀\"9/` `rmdir: ˇ¡␀␀ˇ¡␀␀␀"9\006␀"9/: Invalid argument` <comment295601> @MateuszSzlosek Also I booted with 10.6 and emptied the trash. It seemed to work until I booted with 10.11 and the file was back in the trash again. So maybe it's no a 10.11 issue. (see last response on the other threat, unfortunately I cannot yet comment)
