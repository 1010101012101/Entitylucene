My postcode is not accepted as being correct <body> When changing my country in the App Store I get a message saying my postcode is incorrect, although it is NOT. How do I proceed? I am switching my country to Ireland.  <comment360265> It might help others assist you if you provide the postal code you’re trying to enter, as well as the country you’re switching from, and possibly the exact steps you’re taking. <comment360285> Probably best to reach out to AppleCare to let them know... That stinks, sorry.   https://support.apple.com/en-ie/apple-id <comment360307> Please [edit] your question to include the steps you're taking to change the country.  When changing the country, you *might* need to also change your payment method (for example, only German cards can be used to buy content from the German App Store).  Without knowing what you're doing, we can't figure-out what the problem is.
