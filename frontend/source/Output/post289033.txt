Can I import an image to use for annotations or a signature in the macOS Preview app? <body> I use the Preview app (within macOS) and I'd love to add a traditional stamp to some documents.  I note that under strongTools  Annotate  Signature  Manage Signatures.../strong I can use either the trackpad or camera to add signatures.  Is there a way to import pictures (or even better, vectors) to my signatures without using the trackpad/camera?  <answer289105> I don't think there's any other way than just printing the photo out and then add it with the camera.
