White font on grey pre-boot login screen in Yosemite <body> I am using OS X 10.10.5 with Filevault2 enabled. Since recently the pre-boot login screen has a white font, as opposed to the black one I had before. Since I use a non-retina Macbook (MBP mid 2012), the login screen is grey, thus making the whole thing rather difficult to read.  Is it just me or did Apple change something? Is there a way to fix this?  <comment265942> Seems like something got corrupted in your OS installation. Have you tried reinstalling?
