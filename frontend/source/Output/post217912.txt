How do I use time machine to access system files like /etc/hosts? <body> Time Machine makes it easy to recover older versions of your personal users files; How do you restore an older version of a system file (such as code/etc/hosts/code) using Time Machine?  <answer217922> I think that may be the only thing OS X recovers via Time Machine, especially in El Capitan, with its infamous System Integrity Protection (SIP).  emIf all you wish to be able to recover other than your user files/em is code/etc/hosts/code, then set a root cronjob (or I guess I should say a codelaunchd/code job) to codescp/code or codersync/code the file somewhere else.  strongemNote:/strong codecrontab/code is supposedly "deprecated" in later versions of OS X in favor of codelaunchd/code, but strongit still works/strong (and IMHO, is way easier to setup than a scheduled task via codelaunchd/code -- especially if you have a previous Linux/Unix background)./em  Otherwise, if you wish to recover the entire filesystem, you should look into alternative backup solutions such as CrashPlan, which is quite cheap, and pretty much the standard cloud backup solution these days.  <answer218042> I just used Time Machine on Yosemite to recover code/usr/bin/unzip/code; this is how I did it, given that my Time Machine backup disk is named codeBackup/code and my machine is named codeMyMacBook/code (not really):  ol liSet Finder to show all OS files: From a command line, run codedefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES/code/li liOpen a Finder window to your backup media (eg: codeDevices / Backup/code ) and then drill down into the latest appropriate backup. The codeBackups.backupdb/MyMacBook/code directory will have a series of directories named as timestamps (codeYYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS/code) and codeLatest/code. Each of these directories represents a Time Machine backup.  On my MacBook, the correct directory was codeBackups.backupdb/MyMacBook/2015-10-22-130134/Macintosh HD/usr/bin/code./li liOpen another Finder window, then use kbdCommand/kbdkbdShift/kbdkbdG/kbd to go to your system folder (code/usr/bin/code in my case)./li liDrag and copy the file (codeunzip/code in my case) from the Time Machine window to the system window.

This is something I/you/we/OP should do some further research on, because SIP was really a game-changer for a lot of things in OS X and changed the functionality of a lot of things.  I imagine whether it is turned on or off could possibly make a big difference for Time Machine backups in El Capitan.  I guess it would help to know what version of OS X OP is running. <comment264172> I won't find out until my company moves beyond Yosemite; ask me again in 6 months.
