How to mount ufsd_NTFS partition <body> I have a USB disk and when I try to mount get the following error codemount: /dev/disk3s1: unknown special file or file system./code  codediskutil/code shows  precode/dev/disk3 (external, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk3    1:               Windows_NTFS Seagate Backup Plus ... 444.5 GB   disk3s1    2:                  Apple_HFS Binnie                  555.7 GB   disk3s2 /code/pre  code/etc/fstab/code contains the following line:- codeLABEL="Seagate Backup Plus Drive" none ufsd_NTFS rw,noauto/code  I must have put this in to stop auto mount, as I normally just use the HFS partition, but I want to be able to exchange files with a Windows user.  There is a Paragon NTFS for Mac driver, but I guess it is no longer working since I "upgraded" to El Capitan.  Can anyone advise the best way to mount.  <answer226278> I went to the Seagate site and found an updated driver (at least I assume it is updated - it is unclear).  The NTFS now mounts.
