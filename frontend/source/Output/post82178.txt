How do I take a video version of screenshot on iPod Touch 4th Gen? <body> I want to create videos of myself doing app demos on my iPod, how do I create a video version of screen shot?  <answer82190> You could try Reflector (reflector.com) which is an app that runs on your Mac and grabs sound &amp; video from your ios device over airplay. There's also AirServer but I found that wasn't nearly as responsive and it didn't have video recording ability. Reflector was called Reflection until recently.
