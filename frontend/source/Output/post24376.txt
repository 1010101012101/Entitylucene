Preview often does not allow import from iPad? <body> I am finding that sometimes in Preview, under File there is an option for Import from iPad. But sometimes it is not there at all (as of late) and I can find no way to make it appear e.g. by quitting &amp; restarting Preview, by syncing before running Preview etc.  Does anybody here know what the deal is with Preview not allowing importation from the iPad?  Thanks.  <comment27334> What are you trying to import from your iPad in Preview? Why not use iTunes, iPhoto or image capture? <comment27337> I'm trying to get a screen shot. iTunes doesn't allow import as far as I know and I can't find the screen shot PNG file in my ~/Library folder. But I was able to get a screen shot using xcode4. <comment28125> screen shots are stored in your photo library on the iPad and when you plug in the iPad you can download the photos through iPhoto
