Any suggestions for configuration/provisioning checks or changes?  Mike, thanks for cleaning this up.  Granted the VPN does disconnect throughout the day, sometimes often.  The big issue is the first attempt to connect in the morning.  Nearly 100% of the time it requires several (3 - 8) failed attempts, followed by an inactive period of 5 to 10 minutes, before it will connect for the first time of the day.
