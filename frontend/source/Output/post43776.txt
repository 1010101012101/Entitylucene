Built-In Trackpad and Keyboard Unresponsive after Sleep or Restart <body> I have a MacBook Pro (15-inch, Early 2008) that's currently running 10.7.3. I've been finding that it will intermittently freeze and then I have to shut down and restart the computer, but sometimes that will not fix the problem.  If I plug in an external mouse and keyboard, then I can move the cursor and type again, but as soon as I remove them, the problem persists.  I've tried resetting the P-RAM, reinstalling Lion, installing a new HD, and I've had the graphics chip tested and it's performing properly. If you have any suggestions on how to fix or diagnose, that would be very helpful. Thank you.  <answer43777> So, correct me if I'm wrong, your problem occurs when you open your MacBook Pro?  Resetting your PRAM won't work. Try resetting your SMC. This is responsible for the responses when opening and closing your lid.  <answer113067> strongResetting the SMC/strong should fix the issue. Note that this will reboot the MacBook, so you will lose any unsaved work.  ul liShut down the computer./li liPlug in the MagSafe power adapter to a power source, connecting it to the Mac if its not already connected./li liOn the built-in keyboard, press the (left side) Shift-Control-Option keys and the power button at the same time./li liRelease all the keys and the power button at the same time./li liPress the power button to turn on the computer./li /ul  Note: The LED on the MagSafe power adapter may change states or temporarily turn off when you reset the SMC  <answer114171> I had this same problem.  Installing OS X 10.9 Mavericks resolved it for me.  <comment50009> The problem can occur even if the lid is left open, which would be the case during a restart. And sometimes it becomes unresponsive while using the computer. Nonetheless, I haven't tried resetting the SMC and will give it a try. Good suggestion, Michiel, thank you.  For the record I've also tried turning off Spotlight indexing and that didn't fix anything either. <comment50053> Ok, great. Let me know how it went! <comment50070> Resetting the SMC didn't fix the problem either <comment50924> Just to review, here's everything I've tried: - Reset PRAM - Reset SMC - Disable Spotlight indexing - Re-install OS - Use a different Hard Drive - Tested the graphics chip for defects - Ran a permissions repair <comment72640> Upgrading to 10.7.4 might help. <comment85762> Was it a clean reinstall? Have you tried booting it in safe mode? <comment94655> Same bug happening sometime with Mountain Lion <comment150699> I still experiencing this issue on 10.9.2. <comment332917> 10.10 also with 2015 13 mbp retina
