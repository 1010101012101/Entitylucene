Why is python's "easy_install" installing into the wrong directory? <body> I've installed python 2.7 with the dmg-installer of the official python page. After typing codewhich python/code in terminal, I get this:  /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/python  But when I want to install a package with easy_install, for example like this codeeasy_install pycassa/code, I get the message Installed code/Library/Python/2.6/site-packages/pycassa-1.1.0-py2.6.egg/code, what is obviously the wrong path. So when I try to use the installed package with codeimport pycassa/code I get the error "no module named pycassa".  So how can I fix this issue best?  <answer15875> Find out where easy_install is by in terminal   precodewhich easy_install /code/pre  I suspect that it will be /usr/bin which is Apple's python 2.6  EDIT: I don't have the python.org python so this is from memory.  To use easy_install for the python.org 2.7 use /usr/local/bin/easy_install or /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/easy_install  Also easy_install is not in the Python standard library so you would have to install a package either setuptools or distribute I think the latter is now the preferred one.  To check what easy_install does look at the first line and see what python is used in the #! line  <answer16996> It seems that your installation of setuptools is obsolete.  If you want your "easy_install" match your updated python version, follow these steps:  Download the corresponding .egg file at http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools#files Run it as if it were a shell script: sh setuptools-0.6c9-py2.7.egg This will install the new "easy_install" executable, compatible with your current version of python.  Hope this helps.

Try: 'which easy_install'   If its not the right version, you'll probably find you have other links 'easy_install&lt;tab&gt;' should show something like:  precodePER-MMSX:actions doug$ easy_install easy_install      easy_install-2.5  easy_install-2.6  easy_install-2.7   /code/pre  Use 'sudo easy_install-2.7 ' to ensure that you're using exactly the right version.  <comment17257> Thank you for your answer, you're rhight, easy_install is where you suggested.
