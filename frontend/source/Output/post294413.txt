"Cannot copy extracted data for .. to .." iOS 9.3.5 iPhone 4s Cydia error <body> I have recently jailbroken my iPhone 4s on iOS 9.3.5. Whenever I try to install a tweak I get this error message:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lISf4.png" width="320"  I have looked everywhere and I realized that the problem is because of having less available storage on device. However, I have 4 GB available. I have also installed 'Stashing iOS 9.2 - 10.2' but I still get this error.  <comment371619> How much system storage do you have? Maybe that's low. You can check in Cydia. <comment371699> And they say just click refresh in cydia because they are the same as Apt get update. But that's not working. <comment371700> Me too! How to fix this? I can't even install MobileTerminal or other tweaks because of this. I have more storage.
