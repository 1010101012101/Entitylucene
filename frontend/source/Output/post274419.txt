Rotate Selection in Preview <body> I am doing something I thought would be pretty easy, but apparently I was wrong.    I am wanting to edit blueprints for my sister-in-law's new bathroom redesign.  I have made selections to the PNG with my rectangle tool for the shower, sinks, toilette, doors, etc., etc.,   I simply want to rotate these selections (not the entire imagine) 90°.    Right clicking to rotate, does nothing.  Right clicking isn't allowed.    When I try to go to tools-rotate left with the selection selected it flips the entire imagine with the selection along with it.   I tried selecting the image, copying it to the clipboard and THEN rotating the imagine to get it to line up.  That too doesn't work as Preview clears clipboard every time I rotate the entire image.    Surely I cannot be the only person wanting to do this. I am running 10.11.6  <answer274421>        img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zbw66.gif" width="600"  ol liCopy the selection./li liOpen the selection in a new document./li liRotate the new document./li liSelect and copy the new document./li liPaste the new document into the original./li liRe-position./li /ol
