Plist in /System/Library/LaunchAgents not loading on reboot <body> I have created the plist and placed it in /System/Library/LaunchAgents/. However, when I reboot my Mac it does not load like it is expected to. I am able to load it from the Terminal with codelaunchctl load/code and codeunload/code commands and it is perfectly loaded from there. And also I have checked the console after reboot and it does not have any entry related to the plist.  How can I get this plist to run on boot?  <answer83020> Is the property list owned by root? If it is not, it is not loaded on login even if codelaunchctl load/code (without sudo) would load it.  precode$ sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchAgents/test.plist  launchctl: Dubious ownership on file (skipping): /Library/LaunchAgents/test.plist nothing found to load $ sudo chown root /Library/LaunchAgents/test.plist  $ sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchAgents/test.plist  $  /code/pre  If the program is meant to be run when the property list is loaded, set RunAtLoad to true:  precode&lt;key&gt;RunAtLoad&lt;/key&gt; &lt;true/&gt; /code/pre  Also you can normally use /Library/LaunchAgents/ instead of /System/Library/LaunchAgents/. From codeman launchd/code:  precode~/Library/LaunchAgents         Per-user agents provided by the user. /Library/LaunchAgents          Per-user agents provided by the administrator. /Library/LaunchDaemons         System-wide daemons provided by the administrator. /System/Library/LaunchAgents   Per-user agents provided by Mac OS X. /System/Library/LaunchDaemons  System-wide daemons provided by Mac OS X. /code/pre  <comment123941> Let's see the plist
