SMB share can't rename files/folders <body> On occasion cannot rename or delete files &amp; folders on a Windows Server 2012 R2 SMB share from a Macbook.  Mac OS X 10.10 build 14A389a  The SMB share has granted "Everyone" with Full Control permissions.  Windows 7 desktops access the share without issue.  Error messages received are:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Qvibl.png" alt="The operation can&#39;t be completed. An unexpected error occurred (error code -8706)."  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/afvef.png" alt="You don&#39;t have permission to rename the item."  <answer171671> This is something we had issues with today at work.  It goes like this:  Have a folder (Folder 1) and create another folder in this folder (Folder 2). Copy a file (such as an image) into Folder 2. Now you won't be able to rename Folder 1 without Finder asking for admin password, and entering that gives the same dialog as the second posted above by Ash. Moving (or deleting) the file that was added to Folder 2 out  from that folder makes it possible to rename Folder 1 again. Seems like a bug to me. It has been reported to Apple.  <answer174224> Might have to do with the (automatically created) .DS_Store files. I turned this function off and seems to be working proper now. Here's how:  http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT1629  <answer205667> Sounds like your having issues with ownership and permissions.br This might be due to storing user-X's file inside user-Y's directory.br Now when user-Y tries to rename his directory,br  he is in effect trying to alter the attributes of user-X's file.    hr  Use the codestat/code command to investigate.br Use codechown/code, codechmod/code, codechgrp/code, &amp; codechflags/code to make any changes.  <comment200335> Considering another TLA it is clear that the MBP is not seen it. <comment200512> Windows 7 desktops access the share without issue. I believe the issue is with the Mac, not Windows. <comment200514> agree, that is what I said MBP = MacBook Pro. Guessing the permissions are not clear on MBP site. Check Console log for errors on SMB. <comment202747> I have just reconnected the Windows shares using CIFS:// instead of SMB:// for testing. Will provide an update here. <comment205470> Issue has popped up again - asking for permission to move and rename files. <comment205471> What issues were you having prior to turning off .DS_Store files?
