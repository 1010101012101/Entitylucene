How do I sort albums alphabetically in Photos.app? <body> I would like to know if I can alphabetically sort albums in Photos.app. The iPhoto method for doing this did not work.  <answer207759> Under the View menu, select Keep Sorted By Title to sort albums alphabetically.  <answer223115> Go to View  next select Albums  next click on any album to highlight it  next go back to view &amp; select sort by title  <answer270020> ol liGo to View--Albums./li liIn the My Albums listing, highlight one album and then press Command-A to select all of the albums./li liGo back up to View and click Sort--By Name./li /ol  All the highlighted albums will go into alphabetical order.  <answer278551> If you’re talking about sorting your list of albums alphabetically, go to strongView/strong → strongShow Sidebar/strong or press kbd⌘ cmd/kbd kbd⌥ alt /kbd kbdS/kbd. Then right-click strongAlbums/strong in your sidebar and choose strongSort/strong → strongBy Name/strong.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/u79A7.png" alt="Sort Albums By Name"  If you’re asking about sorting the photos inside an album alphabetically, right-click that album in your sidebar and  choose strongSort/strong → strongKeep Sorted By Title/strong. Note that most photos won’t have a title, and strongPhotos/strong will next sort by date taken.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pBcTe.png" alt="Keep Sorted By Title"  <comment367922> Finally!
