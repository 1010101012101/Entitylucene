How can I fix Error: -69877: Couldn't open device after interrupted formatting process? <body> This question, possibly the same question, has been asked: Couldn&#39;t open device  However, my question hopefully demonstrates a more specific scenario as the situation in which caused the error explicitly known:  The following done as a root user:  ol liI plugged in my SD card and ran codediskutil list/code to grab the internal device node (/dev/disk2)/li liI ran codediskutil partitionDisk /dev/disk2 GPT UFSD_EXTFS4 New 100%/code (UFSD_EXTFS4 is ext4 provided by Paragon)/li liI saw that it was working, so I interrupted the process at step 2./li liI attempted to rerun the command with the number of partitions explicitly stated codediskutil partitionDisk /dev/disk2 1 GPT UFSD_EXTFS4 New 100%/code/li /ol  I get the message:   precodeStarted partitioning on disk2 Unmounting disk Error: -69877: Couldn't open device /code/pre  Running codegpt show -l /dev/disk2/code yields  precodestart     size  index  contents     0  7741440 /code/pre  Running codegpt destroy /dev/disk2/code yields  precodegpt destroy: unable to open device '/dev/disk2': Permission denied /code/pre  It seems to me there is some lock on device disk2. I just need to figure out how to release it.  I was able to release it by rebooting into safe mode (holding shift key during boot) and then rebooting back into normal mode. I would like to know, however, what exactly could be done to release this lock without rebooting.  <answer229969> I have run across something similar before and what I did was issue the command:  codediskutil unmountDisk /dev/diskxx/code  What you do when you shutdown and reboot, even in safe mode is you first unmount all your disks.    <answer278504> For anyone else who ends up on this question after searching online, be sure that you confirm that your SD card is not mounted as read-only! There is a physical tab that you may need to move:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Oic5s.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment303971> typo in command, `diskutil unmountDisk /dev/diskxx` <comment350476> +1 for nice illustration haha. It was not my problem, however. I ended up rendering my card useless by somehow corrupting some read-only bit (possibly alterable by `hdparm`, in my case not)
