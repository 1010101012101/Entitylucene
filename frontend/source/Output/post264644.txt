Macbook keyboard incorrect mappings <body> My gut is telling me this is a hardware problem, but I thought I'd ask here just in case.  I just got a 'new' refurbished Macbook Pro Retina 2013. Pressing the 'i' key inputs an 'o', and pressing the '8' key inputs a '9'. As far as I can tell, these are the only two keys whose mappings are incorrect. I can plug in a USB keyboard and it works just fine.  Is there a way to reinstall the keyboard firmware on a Mac to test for that? Or am I hosed, with the only option being to send it back for (further) repair?  <answer264646> I would reset both your NVRAM and your SMC. See below for instructions.  strongReset your NVRAM/strong  Newer Macs use Non-Volatile Random-Access Memory (NVRAM). It may be worth you resetting this. Here’s how to:  ol listrongShut down your machine./strong Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out./li listrongPress the kbdpower button/kbd emand then/em press the kbdcommand/kbdkbdoption/kbdkbdp/kbdkbdr/kbd keys./strong You have to make sure you press these keys before the gray screen appears or it won’t work./li listrongHold those keys down/strong until your Mac reboots again and you here the startup chime./li listrongLet go of the keys and let your Mac reboot normally./strong/li /ol  strongNote:/strong When you log back in you strongemmay/em/strong need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. mouse speed, time and date/timezone, etc).  strongReset the SMC/strong  Your computer's System Management Controller (SMC) can also be reset. To reset this on your particular MacBook Pro, here’s what you do:  ol liShut down your computer/li liKeep the power cable strongplugged in/strong./li liPress at the same time kbdshift/kbdkbdoption/kbdkbdcontrol/kbd (on the left side of the keyboard) strongemand/em/strong the kbdpower button/kbd/li liLet go/li liTurn your computer back on with the power button./li /ol  After doing both these, let us know how you go.  <comment331716> Sorry, I forgot to mention I have already done both of those things, to no avail. <comment331717> What happens when you start it in Safe Mode? You can do this by holding down the Shift key while it's booting up. Does it work fine then? <comment331719> The problem persists in Safe Mode, and when I boot to Repair mode. I am going to try a reinstall of the OS. <comment331723> Sounds like a fair way to proceed, especially since it's happening in Safe Mode. Also, if you've just bought it, then _refurbished_ Macs will have warranty. How much will depend on where you are and who it was bought from. Either way, if the re-installation doesn't solve the problem, time to take it back. <comment331794> If an external keyboard works fine, that's a pretty good indicator that the internal one is damaged.
