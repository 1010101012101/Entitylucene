Umlauts on Sierra on English keyboard with Alt combo not working anymore for all <body> Before Sierra: Alt + O/A/U pressed then shortly afterwards O/A/U - Ö/Ä/Ü  With Sierra: Alt + O/A/U pressed then shortly afterwards O/A/U - works only for ü  with Alt + o - ø, Alt + a - å and pressing the key again leads only to normal letter  <answer258486> The default key combo in Sierra and older OS Xces on UK/US (physical and logical) keyboards to enter Umlauts is:  kbdalt/kbdkbdu/kbd + kbda/kbd: äbr kbdalt/kbdkbdu/kbd + kbdo/kbd: öbr kbdalt/kbdkbdu/kbd + kbdu/kbd: ü    You probably had a key modifier (like Karabiner) installed in your previous systems and remapped the key combo to get your non-default behavior.  At least Karabiner doesn't work in Sierra currently (as of Oct 2016) and you have to either wait for an update and/or use the old key combo again.  <comment323119> You should add your (logical) keyboard layout and did you install a tool like Karabiner. The common behavior of the logical us/uk keyboard layout is: alt-u & u = ü, alt-u & a = ä and alt-u & o = ö -  in Sierra as well as older system versions. <comment323124> Alright - works. I was confused since I had Karabiner (now no longer working - instead only rudimentary Karabiner elements successor) with mapping Alt-Letter = Umlaut. So I thought (since Alt+u = ü) this is system-built-in. But forgot that I now have to use ALWAYS Alt-u+Letter. Thanks a lot! <comment324697> any other option in the market?
