iPhone 6 shuts down when locking screen <body> I have a problem with an iPhone 6, every time I lock the screen with the lock button or with AssistiveTouch the phone will shut down. Is there any solution or is it an hardware problem?  <comment358850> By shutdown you mean that if you turn it on again you see the Apple icon first? <comment358851> @patrix exactly <comment358855> Have you tried to reset it to factory defaults (can backup and restore from that backup) ? <comment358857> if factory defaults don't fix the problem you should try visiting a genius store if you're close by
