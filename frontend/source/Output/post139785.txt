How to install whats app on jailbreak iPod touch <body> I want to install WhatsApp Messenger on my iPod touch which is already jailbroken. Can anyone please help me install it step-by-step?     <answer140137> WhatsApp does not support the iPod touch (or other Wi-Fi only devices).  For more information, please see: http://www.whatsapp.com/faq/en/general/20951556     WhatsApp is supported on most Android, BlackBerry, iPhone, Nokia, and   Windows smartphones.      Other devices are not supported at this time. If you try to download   WhatsApp on an unsupported device, you will receive a message that   your device is not supported and you will not be able to download   WhatsApp. We currently strongdo not/strong support tablets, computers, or Wi-Fi   only devices, and do not plan to do so in the foreseeable future.   <comment164741> Maybe it's an option to use the 'search-bar' first.
