Block cookies from specific domain <body> I would like to configure Safari to block cookies from specific domains, but looking at the settings I couldn't find any option. Then I searched for extensions that could implement this feature, having no success with that either.  Is there any way to block specific cookies?  <answer176640> You can use a connection manager like Little Snitch to block access to domains of your choice.  It's not from within Safari, but it'll work perfectly - even system-wide.  However, Little Snitch and its competitors aren't free, but they do have trials.  <comment185550> Depending on the domain, a plugin like ghostery might help. It doesn't let you block arbitrary domains, but it maintains a list of trackers from all sorts of sites and blocks them for you. <comment185552> Yes, I used Ghostery for a while. However what I really want it to be able to block other domains.
