Delete a TextEdit document in iCloud <body> I would like to delete a TextEdit document stored in iCould.  The only solution I found was to  ul liopen the document/li limove the document to the hard disk "File &rarr; Move To ..."/li lidelete it locally/li /ul  Any better solution?  <answer91952> ul liMac OS X Lion and Mountain Lion/li liFrom the Apple () menu, choose System Preferences. /li liClick iCloud, and verify that you are signed in./li liClick the Manage button to view the data you have stored in iCloud./li liSelect any of the apps below Manage Storage, select the document or data you wish to   delete from that app, and click the Delete button to remove the item. The data will be removed from your storage allocation and from all of your devices./li /ul  via - http://support.apple.com/kb/ht4847  <answer91970> This seems quite counter-intuitive, but...  ol liIn TextEdit, select strongFile  Open…/strong/li liPress the iCloud button at top left./li /ol  Then:  ul lidrag the icon you want to delete to the Trash in the Dock/li lior control/right click the file icon you want to delete and choose the Move to Trash option (pictured below)/li lior press kbdcmd/kbd-kbdbackspace/kbd (the backspace key is labelled with a left-facing arrow)/li /ul  Move to Trash option in TextEdit Open dialog http://f.cl.ly/items/0D083b1g2A2t151S3g41/Screen%20Shot%202013-05-21%20at%2013.53.54.png  <answer92012> From TextEdit's Open dialogue (File  Open...), you can select the file(s) you wish to delete and press CMD-DELETE (⌘⌫). This will also work with any other app supporting iCloud.  <answer92107> first click tin the top corner to open spotlight, you will find this right beside the notification centre (if you are running mountain lion) then type the file name and click show in finder, after this on the bottom of finder it will show you where is is stored. this should say iCloud.  <comment107968> Thanks I was hoping for a quicker solution but it's already better then the "move to" solution: the overview with the file sizes is surely a nice addition. <comment108019> Where exactly do you select files currently stored in iCloud? <comment108088> @patrix I suspect is suggesting using this keyboard shortcut within the File  Open dialogue... I've upvoted this answer and I'll edit this suggestion into mine (where I do explain the File  Open dialogue). vrtcl1dvoshun: perhaps you could edit your answer to include this detail, too.
