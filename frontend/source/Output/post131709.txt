Can I keep Mail.app from syncing my spam folder? <body> I finally switched all my email access to IMAP. When I did, Mail.app added synced folders for emDeleted Messages/em, emSent/em, emspam/em, and emTrash/em. Is there any way to tell Mail that I don't want to sync these folders? The emspam/em folder only exists for me to occasionally delete its contents and nothing ever shows up in the other three.  I'm running Mail 7.2 under OS X 10.9.2.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/N77Fj.png" alt="Synced folders"  <comment155144> without knowing WHO is your email provider we can not help you further <comment155186> I have a couple accounts at Hostgator and a couple at Hostrocket. <comment155202> great, now go there and disable the IMAP service for the Spam folder
