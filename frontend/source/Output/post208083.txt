Select repeat and choose the weekdays that you want it to go off. You can choose a ringtone or song (We Gotta Get Out Of This Place) instead of one of the standard tones if you want.  The Timer tab in the Clock app can sound an alarm after 8 hours if that's what you want instead.   <comment251017> Why is rescue time not in the app store? Is it safe to download and install such way? <comment251020> Basically your suggestion is to do time tracking instead I understand <comment251034> I'll try your suggestion. Basically I was interested in something that does it without me needing to actually set anything. In Windows for example I know that the Computer first start is part of the Events in adminstrator logs and I think it is possible to configure some event on start up. So I was wondering if some kind of event would cause some app (perhaps the clock app that you say) to add to the current time e.g. 8 hours to ring without needing to set it every day manually. Do I make sense I what I describe? <comment251083> In my point of view it's safe.. But the tracking is more intrusive... My suggestion was to test a tracking soft and put an alert 'work time done' but i don't really know if it's possible. <comment251226> Where is this timer tab? <comment251260> On the bottom of the screen: World Clock - Alarm - Stopwatch -Timer. <comment252062> I am sorry but I can't find this build-in Clock app. Is it when I open "Date & Time preferences" when I click on the current time?
