NTFS external disc restore trashed items <body> I guess I deleted files on my external NTFS storage. I think I can see those files in hidden folder $RECYCLE.BIN on this drive.  ol liis it possible that the MAC NTFS writing stuff I set up before - so I can write on NTFS drives - handle trash as Windows isntead of .Trash folder as mac normaly do?/li liif it is, is there any way how to restore those files?/li /ol  <answer217757> I just tested deleting a file on an NTFS volume under OS X and it placed it in code.Trashes/code on that volume.  Anything in code$RECYCLE.BIN/code is from files deleted under Windows.    By the way, I'm using Tuxera NTFS for Mac for write support under OS X.  <comment263246> here goes my maybe last hope to find out what the hell happened to my _new folder in movies directory :( Actually my last hope is reocery tool if its still somehow somewhere on the disc but I doubt it since I am sure I didnt delete it with terminal command and I dont think there is a way how to skip a trash on mac with finder.
