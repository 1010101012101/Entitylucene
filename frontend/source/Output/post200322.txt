Dock icons colors are messed up <body> This happens sometimes and all i can do to fix it is reboot. Any idea why this happens?img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SaJCH.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer200416> I'd be tempted to go for the 'fix it even if it's not broken' approach...  ul liFix permissions, check &amp; if necessary repair disk, using Disk Utility/li liReset Home folder permissions &amp; ACLs using OnyX  - Maintenance tab/permissions, tick the box at the top then Execute./li liUpdate to 10.10.5 using the 10.10.5 combo update, not the delta from App Store/li /ul  <comment241378> rest of the screen is OK? Does typing `killall Dock` in Terminal fix it? <comment241382> The rest of the screen is okay, oddly enough. I'll try your killall dock. Thanks <comment241416> That actually works, thanks! it still would be nice to figure out why this is happening. <comment241434> Do you notice any pattern?  Perhaps when launching an app? <comment241460> I didn't link this to any app in particular but it usually happens when I wake up my computer from sleep mode.
