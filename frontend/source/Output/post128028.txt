How to join/merge .wmv files? <body> I have ten .wmv video files that I want to join them as one big file.  Some tutorials indicate this can be done using QuickTime. However, it doesn't work for .wmv files.  Is there a way to join these files on a Mac?  <answer128029> You will first want to use HandBreak (free) to convert your .wmv files to .mp4, which can then use according to your tutorial.  <comment150229> HandBreak is great!
