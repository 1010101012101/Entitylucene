Wifi drops intermittently on Macbook Air <body> I have read the other articles with a similar issue but they don't have the exact same issue as I do, hence this post. The Wi-Fi on my macbook air keeps dropping intermittently but works perfectly fine on my Windows laptop and Android phones at the same time. I have been having this issue for over 4 months now.   Note: The Wi-Fi bars at the top right corner remain the same but the internet stops working.   Here are the details of my Macbook and router:  ul li2011 Macbook Air with OS X El Capitan v 10.11.6/li liRouter: D-Link model DIR 600Mâ€¨/li /ul  I have tried the below options but nothing worked:  ol liFormatting the system/li liUpgrading from Yosemite to El Capitan/li liChanging the Wi-Fi router from Linksys to Dlink/li liDeleting the folder /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration and restarting the computer/li liAdding 8.8.4.4 to the DNS tab of the Advanced settings in Network Preferences/li liGave the Macbook to the authorized Apple service center in India. They monitored the connectivity on their Wi-Fi network for 48 hours and found no issues/li liContacted my local Wi-Fi network provider but they have no idea either. They only configure the router./li /ol  The only thing that works is this:   ol liClick on the wifi bar icon(at top right corner)/li liClick on 'Turn Wi-Fi Off'/li liClick on the same wifi bar icon/li liClick on 'Turn Wi-Fi On'/li /ol  Can somebody please help?  <answer246969> You've done a good amount of troubleshooting and at this point, you can probably assume the Mac hardware is probably fine make two conclusions:  ol liyour home router being different than the service router/li liyour other devices re-connecting or reacting to your wifi differently/li /ol  When the internet breaks on your Mac - you'll want to run the wireless diagnostics tool to determine what part of the chain is broken between the Mac and the internet.  Also - log in to the router and see if it still sees the Mac as connected (if your router can do that).  Look for the following:  ol liIs the radio connected between mac and router/li liDoes the Mac have a proper DHCP address from the router/li liCan the Mac ping the router/li liCan the router ping the Mac (or another device on the network ping the Mac)/li /ol  If all of those are up - it's not your network and just a configuration issue on the Mac.  You'll probably need about three times of data collection and then a follow on question for someone to assist with diagnosis.
