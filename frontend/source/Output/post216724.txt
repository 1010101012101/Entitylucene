Word 2016 for Mac is truncating the PDF page <body> When I try to "Save as PDF" a single-page, 8.5" x 14" Microsoft Word 2016 document, it's cutting off the edge. Does anyone know how to resolve this? It almost seems as if 8.5" x 11" (standard letter size) is hard-coded into the PDF driver for Microsoft Office 2016.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/z6qCR.png" alt="Screenshot"  strongEDIT/strong: If I try to Print the document, the print preview window is empty.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AERNK.png" alt="Screenshot2"  <comment261980> As a work-around, you could print - save as pdf. 'Hard coded' is usually a pretty safe assumption to make when discussing Microsoft <comment261981> @agentroadkill: I got a completely blank document using that method, but it appears to be the right size. <comment262003> Hmm... Okay final test: file  print preview, then print. Does the preview look like it should or is it poorly sized or blank as well? <comment262004> The print preview is showing up empty, too. Weird. :-\ <comment262025> I noticed in your edit there is no printer selected. Do you get different behavior if you select a printer before trying to generate the pdf? <comment262158> @agentroadkill: Good idea, but I don't have any printers installed. Maybe my best bet is to use a virtual PDF printer driver. I've sent feedback to Microsoft using their built-in happy/sad-face tool. <comment262170> Happy/sadface is an excellent way to describe difficult UI issues. A virtual printer is probably your next trouble shooting step until you get feedback
