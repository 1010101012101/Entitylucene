Chocolat: How to see Build or Run output for C/C++/ObjC? <body> strongMy Setup/strong:br emChocolat v1.2br OS X 10.7.4/em  I'm using Chocolat to write C/C++/ObjC code. I have saved the file I am working on with the appropriate file extension (e.g. code.c/code, code.m/code, etc) such that Chocolat correctly recognizes the type of code I am writing.  When I select the strongBuild/strong or strongRun/strong menu items, nothing seems to happen.  Is it possible to see strongBuild/strong or strongRun/strong results in some kind of output or console window in Chocolat? Specifically, I'm curious about C/ObjC/C++, but also curious if there is a more general feature for this in Chocolat.  I was kind of expecting that when I strongBuild/strong, I would be able to see compiler or lint output in some kind of window or console. And when I strongRun/strong, I would see codestdout/code and codestderr/code output. Does this feature exist in Chocolat currently?  <comment70167> This is a programming question and, as such, belongs on Stack Overflow. <comment70183> This is not a programming question. This is a question about a user interface feature of a Mac application. Therefore it belongs here. <comment70218> Did you try installing the extras or command line tools for Choclate? Their doucmentation is shady at best, IMO not worth $40+ at this point, I would try contacting the Developer for help... <comment70273> Good idea MrDaniel. I had not thought of/installed that. Unfortunately, after selecting the "Install Command Line Toolâ€¦" menu item, and running the installer, nothing has changed. Still no output in the app nor in Console.app.
