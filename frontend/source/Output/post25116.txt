How do I loop a video in MPlayerX? <body> I downloaded MPlayerX from the App Store and I would like to use it to play a video in loop.  Is there a way to do that?  <answer35452> I can't find a menu, preference option, or any mention on the support page or change logs for a looping option, so I think it might be safe to say no, there isn't a way to do that with that piece of software.  <answer64839> Yes you can!!!  ol liOpen the MPlayerX Preferences window by pressing kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbd,/kbd or via the menu bremMPlayerX &#x2192; Preferencesâ€¦/em/li liGo to the emAdvanced/em tab in the Preferences window./li liIn the textfield with the label emExtra Options/em enter code-loop n/code, where coden/code is the number of times you want to loop./li /ol  <answer65496> There is another method.  Open the video in MPlayerX and empause/em it. Drag the timeline slider to the desired starting point (keep it all the way left to start from the begginiing at time 0:00). Click emPlayback/em in the menubar  emA-B Loop/em  emSet Start Point/em.  Then, drag the timeline slider to the ending point (or all the way right if you want to loop the entire video). Go to emPlayback/em  emA-B Loop/em  emSet Return Point/em.  Now the video will keep looping between these 2 points.  Hope this helps.  <answer222454> Its simple. Choose the video you want to watch. Open it and pause before playing. Then click the button on the right most top and press play where u can find the loop option.

MPlayerX automatically closes after one go. Anyone facing a similar situation? <comment302211> Can you add more explanation? I didn't find any loop option. And the `-loop n` would have a black screen.
