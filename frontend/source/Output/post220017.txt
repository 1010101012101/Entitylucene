MacBook Pro - Apple Buyback Program <body> I recently purchased a certified refurbished MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2014) on January 28th 2015 for $1,699.   I'm using it now as I type this message. That being said, the hardware is in perfect working condition, and there are little to no cosmetic flaws.   Technical specifications:  ul liMacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2014)/li liProcessor:   2.2 GHz Intel Core i7 /li liMemory:  16 GB 1600 MHz DDR3/li liGraphics:    Intel Iris Pro 1536 MB/li /ul  I was considering 'trading in' this Macbook Pro for the new 12' Macbook, and am wondering what value Apple would offer for an exchange/trade-in?  <answer220025> You can find out the value that would be offered right from Apple...   visiting this page from Apple:  http://www.apple.com/shop/browse/reuse_and_recycle  You'll find a section that says the following:  Tell us about your device and get an online estimate from our partner. If it qualifies, mail it in and get an Apple Store Gift Card.  You can click the link there, provide the details about your device, and get an instant estimate as to what it is worth.  <comment266186> A 12' MacBook would be pretty cool. Not portable, of course.
