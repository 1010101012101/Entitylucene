Has anyone tried 2x8GB (16GB) 2133 MHZ DDR3 204-pin RAM in their 2011 MBP 17-inch? <body> And if so, any issues?  I was doing Geekbench benchmarks and found this profile: https://browser.geekbench.com/v4/cpu/1046173  Notice the 2133 MHZ RAM installed on that unit. Clearly, he's able to boot and run his Mac and run all Geekbench 4 tests.   I'm tempted to test it out myself to see if there are any overall system performance increased (boot time, app launch, etc..) but I can't find where to buy that 2133 MHZ 204-pin RAM. Any suggestions?  <answer271974> Just in case you weren't aware, while Apple only officially supports 8GB RAM in your model MacBook Pro, it is in fact capable of running 16GB RAM and many users have done just that. So, if you currently have 8GB or less, you can certainly see some real benefits by upgrading to 16GB RAM (depending on your usage).  As for using 2133 MHz DDR3 modules, it seems they're working okay for rburkat based on his Geekbench results. In reality, the original 1333MHz spec used by Apple is a emminimum/em speed. However, how much your MBP can take advantage of faster memory will depend on the logic board and processor.  In terms of purchasing compatible memory at various speeds for your MBP, you can refer to:  ul liMacSales.com - US and others/li liFlexx - UK/li liRAM City - Australia/li liMac Fixit - Australia/li liSimply Mac - South East Asia/li /ul
