What's the NB30 or MM-TD in an iPhone description in GSX? <body> What's the NB30 or  MM-TD in an iPhone description? I always see these nomenclatures Non block, etc, what does it mean? img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wXS9q.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer266416> The iPhone 6S exists in basically two versions:  Models A1687 and A1688 has support for LTE bands 1-5, 7-8, 12-13, 17-20 and 25-29  Models A1633 and A1634 has support for LTE bands 1-5, 7-8, 12-13, 17-20 and 26-30.  The extra band 30 is a special AT&amp;T band. The iPhone supporting that band were sold by certain dealers in the US.  The NB30 on your iPhone description just means that you iPhone does not support LTE band 30.  <comment320652> Can you please add some examples/links/screenshots which show where exactly these things appear? <comment320704> there it goes, this is in Apple GSX.  Thanks a lot ;)
