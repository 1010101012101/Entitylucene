Installing / removing encfs <body> I'm trying to install encfs, for which I need brew. I installed brew, but installing encfs is a pain.   precodebash-3.2$ brew install osxfuse Warning: osxfuse-2.6.2 already installed, it's just not linked bash-3.2$ brew link --overwrite osxfuse Linking /usr/local/Cellar/osxfuse/2.6.2... Warning: Could not link osxfuse.  Unlinking... Error: Permission denied - /usr/local/include/osxfuse/fuse/fuse_opt.h bash-3.2$ ls -l /usr/local/include/osxfuse/fuse/fuse_opt.h -rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel  7187 17 Dec  2011 /usr/local/include/osxfuse/fuse/fuse_opt.h /code/pre  How can I get this working? Using codesudo/code is not allowed.   <answer123135> Unfortunately it seems like osxfuse has been installed already, outside of brew, and with the root user. Since the permissions of the file are code-rw-r--r--/code, you don't have write permissions to the file. This means that brew can't override the necessary files, and can't install osxfuse.  The only solution would be to use sudo or single user mode, and if it's not allowed, you can't install osxfuse with brew.  Have you tried installing encfs directly from brew? As far as I can see, the only dependencies are coderlog/code and codeboost/code, but then again, I already had osxfuse installed.  <answer124457> You can fix the "permission denied" problem using this command: codesudo chown -R $USER:admin /usr/local/code  The easiest way to install encfs is using "brew install encfs". This will install all the dependencies (gettext ✔, boost ✔, rlog ✔, osxfuse) automatically.

Thanks Newton.
