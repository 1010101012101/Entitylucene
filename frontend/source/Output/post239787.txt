How can I use a wired ipad as a trackpad? <body> I'd like to enable my ipad as a trackpad strongwithout/strong screen mirroring. I know it's such a simple concept, but I've searched everywhere and I can't find the solution. I've exhausted user settings and "third party" applications. Where can I find this option? I'm sure apple isn't intending to hide it, but it's hard to think otherwise.  <comment294418> Something like that ? https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/remote-mouse-free-mobile-wireless/id385894596?mt=8#
