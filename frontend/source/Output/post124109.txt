Record my iPad screen on MacBook <body> I have an iPad 1, and MacBook with Snow Leopard 10.6.8. I want to record my iPad screen to MacBook and share the video file.  I thought I can use AirServer and downloaded it. I mirrored my iPad with AirServer. I am able to see the iPad screen through AirServer on MacBook, but I'm not seeing any option to record my iPad screen.  Could someone advise what I'm doing wrong here?  <answer124110> AirServer 5 lets you record the mirrored screen. Make sure you are updated to AirServer 5 or later or the option will not be available.  <answer198315> There are several 3rd party AirPlay receivers which could run on Mac OS X and receive/record screen mirroring from an iDevice.  You have to download and install one of these applications. Try LonelyScreen (free) or Reflector ($15).  Another way is by using QuickTime. QuickTime on OS X 10.10+ can record iDevice screens, but you must connect your iDevice to Mac, while the AirPlay receiver method can work with Wi-Fi.  <comment145051> Hi, I have installed AirServer Version 5.0.4.0. but i didn't see any option to record. <comment145829> in order to use the record functionality you need to have OS 10.7, which is a free upgrade from 10.6 http://support.airserver.com/
