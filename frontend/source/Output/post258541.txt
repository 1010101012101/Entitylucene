Try again later.  (Error: 3564473453).    I read something about it here and it looks that it is because I am using a debit card.  strongMy question is:/strong Does anyone know what could solve my problem(except using credit card).  Thank you  <answer258580> If you're using the store for the first time with an existing Apple ID, you must provide a payment method. After you create the account, you can change your payment information to "None." If you're creating a new Apple ID, you might be able to create an account without entering your credit card details.
