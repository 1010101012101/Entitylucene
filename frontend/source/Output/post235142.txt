Can't show clock in OSX menu bar <body> Recently the clock on my OSX menu bar has disappeared for no apparent reason. I'm using OSX 10.10.5  I try to add it again by going to System Preferences -- Date &amp; Time -- Clock -- Show date and time in menu bar.  When I click on the option box, after about a second it seems to just uncheck itself. No error or warning is provided.  How can I make the clock appear in my menu bar again?  <comment287575> Have you tried resetting your disk permissions?
