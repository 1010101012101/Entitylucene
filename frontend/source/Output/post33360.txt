How can I adjust additional cinema display screen's brightness? <body> I have an iMac27 run Lion, now I buy a cinema display 27, but at display setting only main screen have brightness adjust controller. And use keyboard to adjust screen brightness also only change main screen.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eC5tv.png" alt="can not find how to control cinema display brightness"  <answer33362> I use Shades. This will solve your problem. I just hope it runs on Lion too.  <answer33364> I search and search, finally find this article https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2649213?start=0&amp;tstart=0 .  Gilletty said that:     I was having the same issue on my MacBook Pro. Here is what I did to resolve it:      ol   liEnsure lid of laptop is open/li   liPlug in power, mini-display, AND USB from the Cinema Display into MBP/li   liRestart computer (*this was the key step for me)/li   liWhen computer comes back up, launch System Preferences  Displays and you should now see the brightness option that was once hidden!/li   /ol   So I plug cinema display usb to iMac27, and reopen display setting, now cinema display has it own brightness controller.  lik this: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/C8qj9.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer115756> It's way simpler than that guys. The brightness on the display is controlled by simply pressing:  kbdControl/kbdstrong+/strongkbdF1/kbd emOR/em kbdControl/kbdstrong+/strongkbdF2/kbd to adjust brightness on your secondary screen.  kbdF1/kbd and kbdF2/kbd to adjust brighness on your main screen.  If you have adjusted settings in System Preferences for the Function Keys to behave as standard Function keys, you will need to hold the kbdFn/kbd key in addition to each combination too.  <comment38052> I already try it, but seems it can turn cinema display as bright as my iMac27. <comment164155> The USB cable made all the difference. No reboot required these days. <comment289508> If it doesn't work, try plugging in the display's USB cable.
