Limit smart mailbox keyword search to message body in El Capitan <body> I have a smart mailbox set up to include all mail that includes my first name, last name, or one of a few other keywords. In combination with a filter for unread messages, this is a great way to find any messages I may have missed in a mailing list thread or otherwise. To achieve this, I use the "Entire message" filter type. Up until Mavericks this searched the entire message embody/em but not the smtp headers (which always include my name because it is part of my email address).  Unfortunately, this has completely stopped working in El Capitan. The "Entire message" filter now considers smtp headers and my smart mailbox contains every mail I've ever received.  My question is, is there a way to restore the old behaviour? Is there a mail.app plugin, a spotlight trick, or anything to make my old workflow usable again? Are there other mail programs that have a smart mailbox functionality and GPG support that I could use?
