Change iCloud email address <body> Is it possible to change one's iCloud email address? I mean the address that ends with @icloud.com, not Apple ID. I couldn't find anything.  <comment286767> An @icloud.com address *is* an Apple ID, so what exactly are you trying to change here? <comment286796> @patrix I think he means can you change johndoe@icloud.com to johnd@icloud.com or something along those lines. And IDK he might need to create a new Apple ID...
