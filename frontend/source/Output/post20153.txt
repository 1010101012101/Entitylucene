Can the current (08/2011) 27" iMac support two extra screens without additional hardware? <body> I am currently considering a new iMac, but I was wondering if this would be able to support two extra monitors.  The setup I am considering:  ul liiMac built-in 27" monitor./li liCurrent Dell 27" monitor @ 2650x1440 (Dual-link DVI via adapter)/li liOne of the Thunderbolt displays @ 2560x1440 (via one of the two thunderbolt ports)/li /ul  This is really two related questions:  ul liIs the above setup viable at all?/li liWill the available resolution be restricted by the video card?/li /ul  <answer20155> Yes, it can. Here is an example of a 27" iMac with two 30" Dell displays.  http://www.engadget.com/2011/05/03/apple-imac-hands-on-with-dual-30-inch-displays-video/
