How can I get rid of a stuck folder in the Finder's toolbar? <body> I was trying to reorganize my desktop and had a folder dragging into another folder.  When I did this, the folder just got stuck in the toolbar and didn't copy over to the new location...  It's not a clickable button as if it were a favorites in the toolbar itself.  When I try to drag and drop it away from the toolbar, it doesn't work.  I then right clicked and went into "Customize Toolbar" and it wasn't in any of the lists for me to take it off.  Obviously its a 'favorites' feature, but how do I get the thing to get off all my finder toolbars now?  <answer57560> If dragging and dropping while holding down kbdCommand/kbd nor dragging the folder out after selecting emConfigure Toolbar/em works you can:  ol liOpen strong~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist/strong/li liGo to strongNSToolbar Configuration Browser / TB Item Identifiers/strong, identify the problematic folder. If it's the only folder in the toolbar, will be the only strongcom.apple.finder.loc/strong item. If not, identifying it is pretty straight forward./li liDelete that item and relog./li /ol  <answer65493> Well I don't know if this is what you mean, but I accidentally dragged a folder into the Finder, and when I removed it a question mark appeared.   How to delete an accidentally-dragged-in folder in the Finder toolbar:  Just hold kbdCommand ⌘/kbd and drag the folder out of the Finder window and whoosh it's gone.  <answer105557> Had the same issue with a folder that got stuck in my sidebar, with no right-click option displaying. I tried removing preference files, etc.  Hold kbd⌘ cmd/kbd and click and drag the icon away from the toolbar.  <answer131073> right click on the item and remove from sidebar is there.  <comment66062> You will probably need to delete ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.sidebar.plist, log out ad back in.  I like to make sure reopen windows is unchecked when I log out for the reset. <comment66131> @ephsmith Thats just for the sidebar, not the toolbar. <comment71632> how does one "Open ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist" ?   also, what does it mean, "relog"  ? <comment71662> @Cheeso In Lion: While in finder click on *Go* (on the menu bar) while holding down kbdOption/kbd and select *Library*, look for the *Preferences* folder and then the *com.apple.finder.plist* file. For opening an editing a *.plist* file, the best option is using **Xcode**. And relog means *Loging Out* of the current user and *Log In* again. Just, on the Finder's Menu Bar, click *  Close Session [Your User Name]* and log int again. <comment92915> YES! This works and is the simplest way. <comment153849> That's remove from sidebar not toolbar
