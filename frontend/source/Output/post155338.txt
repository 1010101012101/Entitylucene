Purchasing an iPhone 6 in the United States - Using it in the United Kingdom <body> I would like to purchase the new iPhone 6, but as I travel a lot between the US and the UK I have to make sure I buy a model that works well in both places. The idea is to buy an unlocked device so I could switch between American and British SIM cards.   I have come across a few articles that state there could be issues with connectivity as the model of the phones sold in US differ from those in the UK. A few of the articles are listed here.  ul liMacWorld (read the second section of the article). /li liReddit  /li liReddit/li /ul  In essence, they say that strongthe main issue is bandwidth. Different models tune into different bandwidths and not all carriers support the same bandwidth./strong   This page on the Apple website shows the different models, the bandwidths that they are suited for, and the carriers and the countries that support them.

There you could only buy this model because all carriers across Europe using GSM technology. If you visit UK Apple Store, you can only buy that model. Check Tech Specs.  If you are on US, you need a sim card from a carrier that use a GSM network like AT&amp;T or T-Mobile. Check this article if you want to read more: CDMA vs. GSM: What's the Difference?.
