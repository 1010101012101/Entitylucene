Where are the files for System Information? <body> I'm just curious if anyone knows where I can find the files that feed the data into the System Information Application (ATA, Audio, etc).  I am interested in writing a program that sends an email every time the battery cycle count increases.   Thanks.  <answer135459> I don't know the file per-say, but you can use a simple shell script to get the battery cycle count, as seen here.  codesystem_profiler SPPowerDataType | grep "Cycle Count" | awk '{print $3}'/code  <answer135465> System Information is a GUI for the CLI system_profiler. It's read directly from whatever codesystem_profiler/code spits out. All the work is already done for you (codesystem_profiler/code reads from many different files and executables):  !Just saw an answer posted. See @XAleXOwnZX for the exact command.   To compile that into a script within strongTerminal/strong, enter text as follows. kbdReturn/kbd is supported for newlines after codecat/code command.  codenjboot$ cat &gt; cycle/code  code#! /bin/bash/code  code#Output is current cycle count of the battery/code  codesystem_profiler SPPowerDataType | grep "Cycle Count" | awk '{print $3}'/code  ul liNow, you have the script. Press kbdControl/kbd+kbdD/kbd within terminal for a carriage return:/li liMake executable:/li /ul  codenjboot$ chmod +x cycle/code  ul liTest:/li /ul  codenjboot$ ./cycle 64/code  ul liMove into your local bin, if it's included in your shell path. The file currently resides in your top user directory ~//li /ul  Optional:  codenjboot$ mv cycle ~/bin//code  ul liNow it runs directly!/li /ul  codenjboot$ cycle 64/code  Addendum: Again, credit to XAleXOwnZX for the exact command  precodenjboot$ cat &gt; cycle #! /bin/bash  #Cycle Count of Battery  system_profiler SPPowerDataType | grep "Cycle Count" | awk '{print $3}'     njboot$ chmod +x cycle njboot$ ./cycle 64 njboot$ mv cycle ~/bin/ njboot$ cycle 64 /code/pre
