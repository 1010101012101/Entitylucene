Messages agent wants to use your confidential information stored in “<key>” in your keychain <body> After upgradering to Mavericks, I have been bombarded repeatedly with the following prompt:     Messages agent wants to use your confidential information stored in “” in your keychain   [Allow] [Always allow] [Deny]   No matter how many times each option is used, the popup appears again after a very short while (usually less than 15 seconds).  Erasing the Messages.app/iChat-related preference files from code~/Library/Preferences//code did emnot/em work.  <answer110009> h1This fixed it for me (though note the caveat at the bottom)/h1  Open code/Applications/Utilities/Keychain Access.app/code, search for codemessage/code, which in my case came up with two keys that I deleted. This required Administrator rights, though.  h3iCloud still wonky though/h3  Probably because I trashed some of my preferences. I can live with that for the time being as it is not in my face every ten seconds.
