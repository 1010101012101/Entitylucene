OS X accessing external drive <body> I noticed that when I plug in an external NTFS HDD something is reading it and it doesn't stop for a long time... I checked with fs_usage and saw this:  precode23:26:54.189404  read              F=5    B=0x28                                                                                                                                                  0.000048 W tuxera_ntfs.242048 23:26:54.189465  writev            F=5    B=0x80                                                                                                                                                  0.000007   tuxera_ntfs.242048 23:26:54.189476  getattrlist                            /Volumes/REDSTAR/Kindle/Kindle books/Dean R.

Why? Is this normal?  UPDATE: it's not Tuxera's fault... it's Spotlight indexing the drive via a Tuxera NTFS driver  <answer95983> Based on your screen shot it is reading/writing the same thing over and over = Kindle!  For some reason Spotlight thinks the Kindle has made changes to the drive and it is re-indexing it.  To find out if that is the problem disable Spotlight and check.  Disable Spotlight  precodesudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.metadata.mds.plist /code/pre  and   Enable Spotlight  precodesudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.metadata.mds.plist /code/pre  To disable the External drive indexing by Spotlight:  ol liConnect the volume or drive you want excluded to your Mac./li liOpen the System Preferences application./li liClick on Spotlight, then click on the Privacy tab./li liDrag your volume or drive into the Privacy menu to exclude them from Spotlight's indexing. /li /ol  <answer96063> That it's spotlight's fault, has been established. But just in case you want to let the culprit live, use "mdutil -i off-d /Volumes/REDSTAR" - this way you don't have to kill/disable spotlight, but just disable the indexing on that particular external drive. This will also enable you to re-enable indexing in the same way, without going through the preferences/privacy, etc.  <comment112569> are you reading kindle <comment112612> Kindle? Not sure what you mean, but no.... <comment112683> Oh Kindle :) No, no... it's just a folder with Kindle books on my external HDD. So not related to Kindle (the device) at all... I disabled the spotlight and the scanning is gone! However after reenabling it, the scanning doesn't come back (strange, but maybe it needs some time)... So now the question is why does spotlight scan the drive over and over - is this normal and has always been like that and I just haven't noticed because my older HDD was quieter than this new one? Do I need to have spotlight service running even though I don't use it - I use Butler? <comment112687> First of all good job in stopping the scan. Every time you unplug and plug the external drive the spotlight will check it for new information. It is its job. It is your choice to disable it permanently ! <comment112756> I went to "System Preferences / Spotlight / Privacy" and added the external drive to the list... the strange thing though is that it wasn't in the list anymore when I reconnected it... but it's working - drive is not indexed anymore... the only thing is that if I wanted to index it again, I cannot do that anymore because it is not in the "Privacy" list so I cannot remove it from there... but no problem. Thank you! <comment112817> great! thank you... but I have already added the external drive to the privacy preferences - should I somehow remove it from there first before running that command? But it's not in the list anymore...:/ <comment112846> If you use mdutil directly, it won't show up on the list. Connect the drive, then remove it from the list, then use mdutil as you wish.
