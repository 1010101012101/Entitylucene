Is it possible to change Apple Mail mail list background <body> I'm using Apple Mail 6.5, configured with "classic view".  Is it possible to change the background color (and the foreground color of the fonts) of the main pane that shows the list of mails in the inbox?  I would prefer a darker background rather than a white one.  <comment137550> I had the same question, and I think for many users it's actually an accessibility issue. There really ought to be a way to fix this.
