How to avoid Mail.app grouping mails <body> While i generally like the newest Mail.app, i particularly dislike that it groups all messages that i receive from a specific sender. This makes it difficult to remove a specific message and i would like to disable it.  Is there a way to turn grouping off and show messages in single message mode, like the older Mail.app was doing ?  <answer40059> Toggle the codeView &gt; Organize by Conversation/code menu item.  <comment45414> Good answer.  And if you subscribe to RSS feeds, you'll have to do this for each feed.
