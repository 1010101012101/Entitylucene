Messages going to the Mac from my iPod <body> Every time I have a message sent to me, it's sent to my family's Mac and my iPod. How do I get them to stop going to my Mac? I have already tried looking into Settings and "Send and Receive" but all I have in there is my Apple ID and email.    <answer192940> ol liSign out of FaceTime and Messages on the device that you want to control better./li liWrite down on a piece of paper all the Apple ID that are logged in to messages and FaceTime on the affected pool of devices./li liDe-register your cellular number from other people's AppleID at https://selfsolve.apple.com/deregister-imessage/li liSign in with your AppleID on only the select devices you want to receive messages./li /ol  Test. At that point, you can ask a follow-on question with a short list of the unique accounts and unique devices and/or ask if there is an Apple support article similar to the one that documents how to remove a phone number from an email (for instance) if that's not the sticking point.  <comment229786> Does everyone share the same Apple ID?
