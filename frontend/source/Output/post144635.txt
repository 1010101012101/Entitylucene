How to crop odd and even pages differently in a PDF? <body> I have a large PDF I want to crop/remove all the whitespace with software that  runs on Mavericks  The PDF in question is designed for print; therefore, odd pages have different margins from even pages. I tried following the tip mentioned in the 3rd comment to this answer, but it seems that feature was removed from Apple's Preview app.   Any ideas? I prefer using free software but any solutions are welcome.  <answer144868> you just need a PDF edittor for mac, there are many apps can do that, if you only use it once for a while, just try with the free online options, if you need to do this often, just get a PDF editor for Mac.  <answer144906> So, after some tinkering, I was able to do it using Automator. I'd be very surprised if this is the most efficient way to do it, but you only need to create the workflow once.  Basically, there's an "Extract Odd &amp; Even Pages" action that you can use to split the file. Here's a list of the workflow:  ol liAsk for finder items./li liExtract odd and even pages (Odd)/li liMove finder items (this moves the extracted PDF to a folder you specify, must be empty; otherwise, it'll be in a temporary folder that's hard to find)./li liAsk for finder items (select the original file again; otherwise, Automator will continue processing the file created in Step 2)./li liExtract odd and even pages (Even)/li liMove finder items (same as 3)/li liAsk for confirmation: Basically, it's a way to pause the workflow while you crop the pdfs. This is optional, you could just create a separate workflow (if you don't already have one) to combine the pdfs, and execute that once you're done. Otherwise, the idea is that you click "OK" after cropping both PDFs./li liGet folder contents/Ask for finder items: Point to the folder where the two separate PDFs are located (or select both, if you used "Ask for finder items")./li liCombine PDF pages: Shuffle option/li liMove finder items (wherever you want the output)./li /ol  That's the general idea, there are some refinements that could be done, if not a complete 'rewrite' to make it more efficient.  <answer267499> try Briss - cross-platform application for cropping PDF files  A simple user interface lets you define exactly the crop-region by fitting a rectangle on the visually overlaid pages.  ul liCrop Odd Even pages seperately/li liCrop PDFs GUI based/li liCrop different regions into separate pages/li liCrop multi column/pages/li /ul  <comment170480> Acrobat Pro would have this feature.
