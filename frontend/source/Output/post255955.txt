How to detect external VGA display on retina MBP running Sierra? <body> I have a 15in Macbook Pro (Late 2013 model) which, until recently, had no problem detecting a VGA projector connected via an adaptor connected to either of the Thunderbolt ports. Today I tried it and it simply could not detect the projector display. The only difference I can think of is that I've upgraded to macOS Sierra since last I remember using this system.  I've tried some other combinations to see if I could figure out what the root cause is, but all of the following options work as expected:  ul liconnect an HDMI display to the HDMI port/li liconnect an HDMI display to a Thunderbolt port via an adaptor/li liboot into Windows 10 (using Bootcamp) and connect the same VGA projector to a Thunderbolt port via the same adaptor/li /ul  All this suggests it's not a problem with the adaptor, with macOS Sierra using external displays, or with the Thunderbolt ports - just with Sierra driving a VGA display.  Does anyone have any idea what the problem is and how I can fix it?  Edit: I've tried resetting the NVRAM/PRAM settings and I've clicked "Detect Displays" a few times in Display Prefs - no success.  <answer256825> Resetting MBP with display plugged in will detect it, they had the same issue with El Capitan as well. Hopefully Apple will fix this bug.  <answer256840> Another person in a different forum discovered that 3rd party mini display port to VGA adapters don't work after upgrading to Sierra. I have tested and verified that this is true as well. At present time it's rather frustrating that Apple is being pesky again with forcing people to buy their expensive adapters. If you are in a rush to use it, buying one from the Apple store seems to be the way to go.  <comment320411> This does not really answer the question.

Sadly it didn't work in my case. <comment320548> @MrMojoRisin How is "reset the MBP with the display plugged in and it will detect it" not an answer to the question of how to get the MBP to detect the display?
