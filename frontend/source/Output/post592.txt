How do I set which Apache / PHP 10.6 should run? <body> All my problems stemmed from trying to get mcrypt for PHP installed. Last night I gave in and followed a tutorial of how to do a totally fresh apache2 and php5.3.3 install. I did this using macports  Sadly, that didn't enable mcrypt for me last night, although I was pretty pleased that I got 5.3.3 running :)  The problem is that I have woken up this morning to find that my php version is back down to 5.3.1 which can only mean that OSX has reverted to my original Apache and PHP.  strongHow to I tell OSX to use the software I installed via macports?/strong  em(And then I will as a new question of how to enable mcrypt)/em  <answer598> Why does OSX need to know which Apache to use?  Just run the correct Apache yourself.  Open up Terminal, codecd/code to the macports directory containing the correct Apache (probably code/opt/something/something/something/Apache2/bin/code or something like that), and run it (probably something like code./httpd/code).  <answer631> You have two solutions :   ol liYou have to edit the global codePATH/code variable to add MacPort folders at the beginning. It contains the order of folders the system uses to find binaries./li liBackup original binaries (in code/usr/bin/code, code/bin/code, …), then add symlinks to MacPorts binaries./li /ol  Normally, strongdo not use/strong option 2 until you really know what you're doing. I just mentioned it because it's technically possible.  To edit the global codePATH/code variable, edit the file code/etc/paths/code, add code/opt/local/bin/code at the beginning and finally reboot to apply changes.  You can control, after the reboot, that changes have been made by do the following command :      echo $PATH   You should see code/opt/local/bin/code just before code/usr/bin:/bin:…/code.  <answer646> It's not so much your version of Apache/PHP have been reverted - it's just the wrong version is loaded.  If you have Mac OS X's Web Sharing enabled it will auto enable the version of Apache and PHP Apple provides using the LaunchDaemon codeorg.apache.httpd.plist/code in code/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/code (this will override MacPorts version). You'll want to disable this by either turning off Web Sharing in the Sharing Preference Pane or by running codesudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.apache.httpd.plist/code.  When you installed Apache for MacPorts it installed a LaunchDaemon into code/Library/LaunchDaemons/code which if enabled will start up the MacPorts version of Apache automatically. To enable it run codesudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.macports.apache2.plist/code and you're off to the races.  If you're running codeapachectl/code to restart - make sure you've selected the right version. You may need to alter your $PATH to have code/opt/local/apache2/bim/code before code/usr/sbin/code  As for what version of PHP is being used; on the command line this will depend on your $PATH while for Apache it's entirely in your configuration of where the libphp5 module is. (code/etc/apache2//code for the built in version, code/opt/local/apache2/conf/code for the version MacPorts installed)  <comment593> If you only want answers to match "How to I tell OSX to use the software I installed via macports?", perhaps you should edit your question. Because, you're asking two different things.
