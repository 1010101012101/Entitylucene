How to get the password hashes for a user in Mac OS X 10+, in recovery/single user mode? <body> I would like to view the hashes on my Mac, in either single user mode, or the terminal in recovery mode.   I tried to follow the steps described in OS X 10.9: where are password hashes stored. But I do not see my users plist file in the /var/db... folder, but I see root, nobody, daemon, and other .plist files. How can I find these files in recovery/single user mode?  Note: The OS I would be using is either OS X Yosemite or OS X El Capitan; both would be great to know.  <answer220538> When booting into recovery mode, the main hard drive is mounted under code/Volumes/NameOfMainVolume//code (usually code/Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/code or code"/Volumes/Macintosh HD"/code). So if you need to access files residing on the main drive, include that part into your access path.   <answer220539> Booting to Recovery Mode you will find the users' .plist files in  precode/Volumes/NameOfMainVolume/var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/users/... /code/pre  Don't forget to escape spaces in the name of your main OS X volume with a backslash.   Booting to Single User Mode you have to mount your main volume first:  precode/sbin/fsck -fy /sbin/mount -uw / /code/pre
