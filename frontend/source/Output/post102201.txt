Updating iTunes to 11.1.0 gives an error <body> I tried to download the iTunes 11.1 update and received the following error. Does anyone know what could be causing it?      The operation couldnâ€™t be completed. (NSURLErrorDomain error -1102.)   <answer102234> It's due to the overload on Apple's side relating to the launch of iOS 7 a few hours ago.   That part of the download infrastructure should scale up over time well - try again every 30 minutes or so.   <answer102241> try now, it's working....it was overloaded i guess.  <comment120367> Do you have a firewall in use? <comment120369> Did you try to download directly from apple.com instead? I had similar issues when I used the update check from within iTunes <comment120392> Earlier today, I successfully downloaded iTunes 11.1 (126) from [here](http://www.apple.com/itunes/download/) _to an iMac_. <comment120393> Apple site still has 11.05 not 11.1 <comment120547> Gotcha. I tried from the the download page this morning and everything worked.
