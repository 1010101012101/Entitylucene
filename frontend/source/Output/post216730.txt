This copy of the Install OS X El Capitan application can't be verified. It may have been corrupted or tampered with during downloading <body> Macbook Pro 13" 2015 with OS X Yosemite on board. I've been trying to install OS X El Capitan, but always get the following message:  "This copy of the Install OS X El Capitan application can't be verified. It may have been corrupted or tampered with during downloading."  By the way this is not a date time issue, date is correct on my computer.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/E1BMF.png" alt="enter image description here"  How can I fix this? Who knows the solution, please help.  <answer216940> Here's what I went through. As long as I erased my Mac and "bootable usb El Capitan install drive" installation process complained with verification problem I decided to reinstall "Yosemite" using the built-in recovery disk, then I downloaded installer for "El Capitan" from "App Store". It was not possible to install through the "bootable usb drive" again, so I updated to El Capitan, oddly worked. And finally I erased my Mac and repeated reinstallation for "El Capitan".  <answer218788> Actually there are two known possible causes for this message the show up.  One is the obvious corrupted installer.  Another less obvious and more tricky cause can be a reset internal clock in the machine, with a resulting date which is previous to the release of the OS installer, what will trigger this message too.  Hope this can help someone.   <answer219067> Follow this tutorial. This applies to the reply from @Cazuma Nii Cavalcanti. In short once you are at the first install page go to tools in the nav bar and open the terminal, in the terminal type codedate MMDDHHmmYY/code replacing the letters as follows.  precodeMM - 2 digit month  01 - 12 DD - 2 digit date   01 - 31 HH - 2 digit hour   01 - 24 mm - 2 digit minute 01 - 59 YY - 2 digit year   &gt; 15 /code/pre  once that is done go through the install normally. I just tried it and it worked with a USB install of OS X (10.11 - El Capitan) and it worked like a charm!  If setting to correct date doesn't work. Set to a date just after the os release.  <answer219765> I encountered the same issue when performing a clean install on a new hard-drive. Most likely it was caused by disconnecting the battery in order to safely install the hard-drive.  After setting the date the install was successful.  <answer227911> I ran into this problem.  I had installed a brand new SSD; I downloaded the installer and created a bootable USB stick.  Everything looked raring to go.  Hours later...  The ways to resolve this process:  ol liTry setting the date to today's date as documented EVERYWHERE.  If the install still fails:/li liUse htiutil to verify the checksum.  Assuming you have the El Capitan download in the Applications folder, you can verify the download with the following command:  precodehdiutil verify /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ El\ Capitan.app/Contents/SharedSupport/InstallESD.dmg /code/pre/li liWhen did you download the installer?  Apparently my problem was that I had downloaded the installer a number of days ago and the certificates had expired.  If setting to today's date does not work; and the htiutil command came back with "is VALID"; try setting the date to the date your downloaded the installer.... or possible a few days earlier.  I did that, and the install completed with no problems..../li /ol  Good luck!  <answer229881> I have found the solution for “This copy of the Install OS X El Capitan application can’t be verified. It may have been corrupted or tampered with during downloading” error!   If you have tried changing the date / time / on a startup disk, forget about it... Make sure you have an internet connection about 10Mbps at least. What you need to do are as follows :-  ol liRestart your mac.

I think many people think setting the date to the current date automatically fixes the issue, but this is not the case. You have to remember the date you installed "El Capitan OS X installer.app" into your Application folder. For me, it was around Sept 2015. Right now is March 2016. When I got this error while reinstalling El Capitan OS X, I set the date to today's date (i.e. date 03061225616) and it did not work because I installed "El Capitan OS X installer.app" around Sept 2015 and the digital signature/certificates for my installer had expired by now. Once I reset the date to Sept 2015 (i.e. date 0923020415), the installation worked without a problem.  If you can neither remember nor correctly guess the date you installed "El Capitan OS X installer.app" into your Application folder, then you would have to delete it and reinstall it into your Applications folder so that the digital signature/certficates for the installer is no longer expired.  Also, setting the date manually in the terminal (i.e. date MMDDhhmmYY) worked for me. I heard setting the date automatically in the terminal (i.e. ntpdate -u time.apple.com) works for some people, but not for me. It most likely worked for them because they recently installed/reinstalled "El Capitan OS X installer.app" into their Application folder  <answer232016> If you are confident in the integrity of your installation media, you can use the terminal to bypass this message completely. The below instructions are for installs performed via a bootable USB stick:  ol liOpen the terminal:/li liEnter: codeinstaller -pkg  /volumes/Mac\ OS\ X\ Install\ DVD/Packages/OSInstall.mpkg -target /Volumes/"XXX"/code where XXX is the name of the disk you're installing to./li liWait for the installation to say it's complete. You will not see any sort of graphical progress display./li /ol  This allowed me to install El Capitan a couple of weeks ago. I didn't have any internet access at the time, and my Mac had a completely empty hard drive, so I was emvery/em happy that I could force the install to go through.  I suspect that this method could be adapted for live installations, but failing that, consider creating a bootable installer and then following the above instructions.  <answer242282> you could set the time with the codedate/code command, but you have to figure out the crazy format and type it in. There's a much easier way.  ol liConnect to wifi, then /li lirun codentpdate pool.ntp.org/code/li liyou can verify the time is set correctly by running codedate/code. Mine was set to the wrong timezone, but that doesn't really matter./li /ol  That's all I had to do to get my install to work.  <answer257860> Apple installers have a 'best before date interally'  I just bought a used imac, and wanted to update it from Mavericks to Yosemite.  This is what I did:  ul liSystem Preferences - Time and Date /li liUncheck set time automatically./li liSet time and date to 1 January 2014/li liRun the installer.  No longer corrupt./li liSet time and date back to automatic./li /ul  For Yosemite the critical date has to be before some time in February 2014.  Other updates will be different.  I think you have about 3 months after the next version is officially released.  <answer276998> strongMarch 2017 Success Confirmed/strong This answer is relevant because: The solutions above did not (completely) work for me. Apple may have changed its check routine and date stamp in 2017. It offers an addition to reach a working solution.  strongMacBook Pro Quad 2.4GHz i7 Late 2011, 16GB RAM, 500GB SSD, original 750GB HDD. Running OS 10.8 initially/strong. After 4 years, time to upgrade the MacBook Pro which I run as a graphics workstation through a 27" monitor and standalone full size keyboard. Adobe CS6 and Office 360 are the major software. Hardware completed no issues (SSD into optical bay / 2 x 8GB Ram chips). For the OS I decided on strongEl Capitan 10.11/strong since it is reported to have system / performance enhancements and Sierra is a step too far, turns too much off on this Mac.  Issues on trying to do this are well documented so I wont dwell, other than to say my last App Store download was 10.8 and so I wasn't 'allowed' to download 10.11 officially, even though it is more appropriate to my Mac than 10.12. This isn't about money or subversion. I would gladly pay for an official disc or download. I simply could not get one.  strongRoutine/strong  1) You will need the base installer application for El Capitan (which is what you would download from the app store if allowed). You can either get this off a Mac colleague (who has downloaded it previously), ebay, or Hackintosh (which is an unofficial website dedicated to running OSX on a Windows box).   Obviously certain risk involved here. Use a proven source, don't torrent. Waste of time and may be corrupt / subverted which just causes more frustration. Once you have the application put it in your applications folder.  strongNote:/strong if you are concerned, run the Terminal verification command on the installer as noted by pRose_la above (credit due). Ensure it reports Verified on conclusion.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/a6nYv.png" alt="El Capitan installer app"   strongNote:/strong The app wont work at this stage. If you launch it you will get an endless 'verifying installation' bar or the screen noted in other posts (corrupt or tampered installation). Time stamp will be out of date.  2) Create a boot volume on an external USB Flash drive. This must be 8GB+ capacity. This is allowed by Apple and they give you the terminal code to do it here: Apple create an external boot drive  strongNote:/strong the El Capitan installer must be in the Mac's root application folder for this to work as the terminal command goes there to get it. Also the Flash drive must be formatted with a GUID partition to boot the OS (El Capitan on Flash boot drive).  strongNote:/strong there is an GUI app to do this for you DiscmakerX but its buggy and failed consistently for me with no indication to the problem (paths were correct, formatting correct).  3) strongNEW 2017/strong: this is the addition to the process. At this point, I could boot remotely to Flash drive, access terminal to circumvent the date issue, launch the El Capitan installer. However, it would always get to 99% installation and then crash, sometimes with a final message - this installation is corrupt. I examined the El Capitan Installer app (right click the installer app / show package contents) and noted a folder called _CodeSignature. I went to my 'official' 10.8 installer app and lucked out... the same folder was in there. To be clear:  I copied the _CodeSignature folder from inside Install OS X Mountain Lion.app to the same position inside Install OS X El Capitan.app on the Flash drive.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/s24rb.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/O3Jxd.png" alt="enter image description here"  4) Restart the Mac with option (alt) key pressed and you will be presented with bootable volumes. Select your Flash Drive using the keyboard arrow keys and press enter. Give it 5 mins to boot up. Don't get impatient. The remote installation now went through perfectly. I have 10.11 installed on an SSD partition and updated to the latest version through Apple app store.  strongNote:/strong You still NEED TO RESET THE DATE in terminal after your Flash drive boot and before you launch the El Capitan installer to bypass the initial date certificate issue. Details in posts above, remain valid. Set mine to the day after the application download date (find this date with Get Info on the installer app itself).   strongConclusion/strong This process worked for me in March 2017 on a late 2011 Mac running OS 10.8. I now intend to create remote installers for Yosemite and Maverick just in case I need them for my other Macs in future. Do I feel bad about this hack? Not really. Disappointed that I have had to go to these lengths to update a perfectly good Mac that cost me in excess of $4000... because I didn't choose to upgrade last year.  <answer278165> If you get this error message it is most likely not a problem with the installer, but rather an expired certificate.    Please see the article "Previously Downloaded OS X Installers No Longer Work".  Fortunately, there is a very easy workaround for this.  "...due to an expired certificate, OS X installers downloaded prior to 14 February 2016 won’t work.  The Apple Worldwide Developer Relations Intermediate Certificate is required for all apps in the Mac App Store, including OS X installers. When used to sign an app, the certificate enables OS X to confirm that the app has not been corrupted or modified by an attacker. This certificate expired on 14 February 2016, causing error dialogs and preventing some apps from launching. Most affected apps have already been updated with the new certificate. But if you downloaded an OS X installer in case of trouble, you may be in for a surprise the next time you try to use it."  The above article was linked from here: "This copy of the Install OS X Yosemite application can’t be verified. It may have been corrupted or tampered with during downloading. | Need Help 4 Mac"  If you set your Date &amp; Time prior to the date mentioned above before installing you can bypass the hitch, and the installer works normally. Simply set it back after the installation is complete and you're good to go.  If you purchased an older OS like Yosemite before it was removed from the App Store it can be re-downloaded from the Purchases tab in your App Store account, and it should have an updated certificate.  <comment261990> Have you deleted the "Install OS X El Capitan" application bundle and downloaded it again? <comment261991> & where did it come from? <comment261992> @user3439894 I'm actually trying to download it again. Internet connection is poor, so I'm waiting. And yeah, there is no previous copy of the installer app in /Applications/ directory. <comment262000> @Tetsujin App Store <comment262001> If you're already doing as the message suggested and haven't finished the new download and tried installing again, then why did you even post to begin with?  If you're having trouble with maintaining a constant connection or have a connection fast enough to get it downloaded in a timely manner you may need to find a better connection for the download. <comment274244> This should be the accepted answer. <comment279629> I just met the same problem. After set the date to today (2016-02-29) it still failed. Then I set to an earlier date (2016-01-01) and it worked. Weird. <comment280869> Setting a date near to the date your downloaded the installer , is a solution for fix the message and OS X El Capitan install begin normally and finish ok. <comment280870> Set the date earlier from the current date e.g., if today it's the 29 Feb 2016 set it as the 1st Feb 2016. This worked for me. <comment280871> you can just set the time in the system preferences back to let's say 29th of september 2015. <comment280872> I have face same problem then I set the earlier date & time in terminal utility then it worked for me <comment280873> The installer date made a big difference for me. When I set the date of the machine close to the date of the installer, installation proceeded with no difficulties. <comment281455> Indeed, changing the date to the date of the download make it work, I recommend using Wikipedia to check the release version in order to change the system date. <comment281472> Setting the Date close to the release date of the OS worked for me. <comment282031> It is arguably faster to type `ntpdate pool.ntp.org`. But this requires internet connection. <comment283432> Try using a USB installer? <comment284631> @JakubFedyczak Perhaps, but I suffered the same issue, attempted the `ntpdate` and it didn’t work. Tried to force the date to something in the past as this answer suggests and it works 100% fine. <comment287727> And a third just confirmed personally: the clock on the computer has to be set to a date near the date of the download.  It may be that the installers just have a timeout built into them so there's likely a range of valid dates but setting the clock to the day of the download worked for me. <comment292719> This was exactly my problem. I downloaded the installer in Nov 2015 and setting the date properly (May 2016) would always fail. As soon as I changed it to Dec 2015 it worked great. Thanks so much! <comment300466> This answer outlines a convoluted process that does not get at the heart of what the problem was or why; not to mention that it is a huge waste of time. <comment300473> It's just the way it is. <comment300483> What a huge waste of time? <comment302407> The point is that None of the answers were helpful until the date when I found the solution. So at that time I solved it on my own. I didn't check other answers which showed up later, cause the problem doesn't bother me anymore. <comment302940> For El Capitan, I just set it to Jan 1 2016 and it worked fine. <comment310268> This worked for me using 1 jan 2016. Thanks dude <comment321584> Jan 01 2016 00:00 worked for me too with El Capitan (since Sierra is unusable for me). Does this mean that all Appe's installers have a "best before" date? Then why the cryptic message???? Hate when they waste my time like this.... <comment322195> Can you update your answer with some evidence from Apple about 'critical date' as well as the Feb 2014 date you mention?  I've never heard of this before and it would help if your answer had verification. <comment322210> This answers makes zero sense. You can still download Yosemite (and Mavericks, and...) from the Mac App Store. It isn't like iOS where Apple stops signing installations from older versions after a certain date. <comment322513> You cannot download Yosemite if you didn't download it once before.  A downloaded copy will not install without the date change on the 4 machines I've done this with.  you can test this:  Create a new apple ID from a throw away address.  Log in with that address into appstore.  Try to find the Yosemite install file.  It is possible that the problem is keyed to the C-time of downloaded file. <comment324916> Works great. I said `date 0101010116` and away we go. <comment333407> Yes! My date was correct. I was connected to the internet (after first not being connected), but it wasn't working. But, it still wouldn't install, but this worked perfectly. <comment345337> dude, god bless you, you saved my life :) <comment353475> I tried all the above. Then I found a post where you actually actually do not connect. Change the date to 0202020216 and it worked !http://capitalmacservice.com/os-x-installers-cannot-verified-tampered-corrupted/ <comment356566> What's happening here is likely that the installer is trying to check its code signature, which involves checking the validity of all the certificates in the certificate chain. All certificates have an expiration date, and the application itself is likely signed with a certificate that has since expired. By setting the date to a date in the past, for example, October 1, 2015, you'll allow the certificate check to complete successfully.
