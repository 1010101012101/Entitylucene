How do I connect to my web server on mac? <body> On Ubuntu, I was able to connect to another server using "places". Is there anything like that in Mac OS X?  <answer9841> In Finder, choose Go  Connect To Server (kbdcommand/kbd+kbdK/kbd) and type in the URL or IP for the server (including the protocol if not afp).  <answer9851> The application I would call the most "PuTTY-like" in MacOSX is JellyFiSSH.

See [this question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/5209/4024) for methods of enabling ssh through Finder, consider purchasing a separate application to connect to the server, or just use the command line. <comment10310> i think i'll learn to use command line
