Managing Images in Keynote Data file <body> Is it possible to use the data folder to manage all your assets, similar to source assets in Indesign?   Ideally I would be able to place my images in emPackage Contents  Data/em and update the images in this folder. However, Keynote rewrites the image names and removes sym linked folders placed inside.   I'm currently managing a large project and having to update every slide with new images.  Any tips are greatly appreciated!   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TgzyF.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment314242> Where is the 'Keynote Data' folder? In a Keynote document or the Keynote app? <comment314250> From the look of the folder structure that is the package file that is the "document" that any iWork app creates. From what little I know of this I don't believe these are ever intended to be opened or modified. And changing any files will require you to also change the XML files that contain the pointers to the files in the document. you may need to look for a forum dedicated to iWork for answers like this...
