Core Audio Driver not working <body> I have been using Virtual DJ on my machine.  The setup is where I want audio to play over the headphones and use a USB sound card to play audio into my headphones so I can listen to music before I play it for everybody.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3KOQs.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  However, the last time I tried, I got an error message saying "Error in the sound driver of Core Audio.  Your sound card is probably not connected, or the settings are incorrect".  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jyORb.png" alt="enter image description here"  If I use the headphone by themselves, the USB sound card by itself, or my speakers by themselves, they all work individually.  How do I go about figuring out what's wrong here?  <answer63890> When the USB sound card is plugged to the Mac, do you see it in System Profiler (from Apple Menu - About this Mac - More Info... - System Report) as a USB device ?  If so, can you then see the audio device in System Preferences - Sound - Output ? If not, would other USB devices work on the same USB port ?  <answer64634> I figured it out!  Under Utilities, there is a MIDI setup.  This had stored a profile for my Virtual DJ pro software.  I deleted that profile, restarted my software, and the error went away.  Apparently, there was an invalid configuration saved that was causing the issue.  I wish I had saved screenshots of the profile so that we can actually see what the error was.  <answer87087> i figured out how to end this problem. I closed VDJ, then opened application/utilities/audio midi setup. then delete the VDJ advanced setup. then re-open VDJ and it worked like a charm again.  <comment73882> Just asking did you tried rebooting or killing the CoreAudio Drive ? <comment73895> I have rebooted several times.  I do not know how to kill or reinstall the Core Audio driver. <comment73933> I see it in the system profiler.  I cannot see it under System Preferences.  It is because the driver went bad? <comment73950> You can kill it with `killall /usr/sbin/coreaudiod` in the terminal but rebooting almost does the same thing so it won't help you. <comment74000> I tried `killall`.  The response is `No matching processes belonging to you were found`.  Is it that the service somehow is AWOL? <comment74002> try `ps -e | grep core` If you don't see `coreaudiod` it means it's not running. That could a hint to your problem. <comment74003> hmm.. the `coreaudiod` process exists, but it does not have my name under it. the owner is shown with `??`.  It shows up as `171 ??        36:28.58 /usr/sbin/coreaudiod` <comment74005> `??` is not the owner but the `TTY`. <comment74048> CoreAudio is part of the OS, have you installed extra drivers ? <comment74062> I guess the best way I can answer that is to say I have installed more software than comes in on the Mac out of the box.  I do not know if the software I have installed has installed any drivers.  How do I check that?
