iWork Numbers 3: detect change in row <body> I'd like to update the datetime in a cell whenever any cell in the row changes. Is this possible in strongiWork Numbers 3/strong?  If not possible to look for changes in entire row then perhaps only "watching" a single cell?  <comment131162> Sorry, I have a date/time column. Whenever any cell in a row changes I'd like to automatically update the corresponding cell in that column with the current date & time.
