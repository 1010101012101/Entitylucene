Can I link a new Macbook to an old Macbook? <body> I just got a Macbook Pro Retina 15". It is sweet.  My old Macbook Pro, which I got in like 2007, can't run anything higher than OS X 10.6.8 (Snow Leopard). My new Macbook runs 10.8.2 (Mountain Lion).  Is there a relatively simple way to use my old computer with my new one, perhaps as an extra screen?  <answer72734> Apple portables doesn't support this kind of behavior as described on their support page. So unfortunately that isn't an option.   <comment84453> You will need a third-party software solution for this.
