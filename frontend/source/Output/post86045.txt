Transfer iPhone 5 photo library on to a Network Storage Device <body> I'm running out of space on my iPhone and would like to transfer my iPhone photos to a NAS and then delete them. I like to view my pictures from NAS via an app.  Can somebody recommend a good NAS and app that can help me achieve that?   <answer89755> Instead of using a local solution for your media, you could consider using Dropbox. With Dropbox you can stream videos, photos, and even use it for storage. You get roughly 2 GB for free (more if you refer users), but if you need more space you can easily upgrade your account, for a fee, to the Pro version which provides much more storage.  <answer110111> Synology NAS hardware offers this, take a look to the apps[1] I think it is what you are looking for.  [1] Photo Station is the app: https://www.synology.com/en-global/dsm/5.2/multimedia  <comment129768> Could you offer a link to an app that satisfies the OP's needs? <comment129820> Added some links...
