Native OSX Dictionary <body> Is there a native dictionary on OSX?  I would like to be able to click on a word (in any open window), and get its meaning in a quick popup windows.  <answer142604> Mouse over a word and tap the trackpad with three fingers, or enable the Dictionary service in System Preferences to assign a keyboard shortcut (by default, it's ⌃⌘D).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fujle.png" width="355"  <comment167975> Fantastic! That's the tool I need. <comment167994> Side note: by default, Mavericks assigns ⌃+⌘+D (control+cmd+D) to open the Dictionary for whatever word your cursor is currently over. <comment168013> If for any reason you can't select the word, bring up Spotlight (⌘-Space, or click the magnifying glass icon in the upper-right corner) and type the word in to the search box. The definition will be shown if it's in the dictionary.
