iPhone old backup <body> There are two backups shown in the code~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/code in my laptop.br I want to restore the older backup from it using iTunes.   How can I select one of the backups and ask iTunes to restore the selected backup to iPhone?  <answer216258> You should be able to right click on the phone in iTunes (it used to be on the sidebar, now I think the icon is on top) and select restore from backup. When you do that, a dialog box pops up with a drop down asking you to select which backup you want to use.  <comment261285> Yes it shows select the option then in dropping bar list it shows my iphone name and a button restore. if i select this will it give me options of backups stored in this computer? <comment261289> No, those ARE the available options to restore from. If it's only showing you one, then that's the only one available to use.
