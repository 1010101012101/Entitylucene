Can we disable the drag window to top of screen Mission Control / Spaces feature in El Capitan? <body>    Open Mission Control      Use any of these methods to open Mission Control:      ....      ul   liIn OS X El Capitan, drag a window to the top of the screen./li   /ul   https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204100  I'm using a window snapping/resizing app and this feature above, introduced in El Capitan, is being triggered instead. This when I snap a window to the center top of the screen.   Is there a way to turn this feature off?  <answer214691> According to the Reddit thread, Is there any way to disable Mission Control coming up when I drag a window to the top of the screen?, the solution is:     System Preferences  Mission Control      Uncheck "Displays have separate Spaces" then log out and back in again.   It works, I had the same issue &amp; now it's sorted.  <comment258743> Are You using Better Touch Tool for windows snapping? Because there's an option **El Capitan: delay Mission Control on top edge**. <comment258762> @MateuszSzlosek I'm using HyperDock though, I have have Better Touch Tool as well. I'm happy with the look and feel of that but, might give BTT a shot to see how it feels. <comment278544> This worked for me, but introduced another problem relating to use of iTerm2 in a secondary window... so I had to switch the separate Spaces back on again. Looking for a solution that would only disable the drag to top edge feature of Spaces... <comment323293> I also really really really hate this as a long time mac user. It wastes so much of my time. Adding this without an option to disable was really evil. <comment330803> *You* should choose to reopen the last opened applications and return this page back and **upvote** this. :) <comment334081> This does not work for me. I _sometimes_ get the expose behavior when dragging to the menu bar, sometimes I don't. I have my menu bar on an external display on my MacBook Pro. <comment357881> This removes the top menu bar,Â which for me is a bad tradeoff. <comment372688> Pirkka Esko, you hit the nail on the dot. You have to choose: either have spaces off so that you can have a separate display act like its own computer (bar on top, full screen, etc) or turn it off so that you can properly use resizing apps. Apple should fix this.
