Mac Numbers Shortcut Help <body> In Numbers (I'm currently running v3.6.2) after I have selected a cell/row/whatever, I want, without irritating my carpal tunnels, to format that text strikethrough.  In Excel, I just had to add the little strikethrough button to the top bar and emwhoosh/em it's that much easier to strike items from my ToDo lists.  In Numbers at the moment the only way I know to strike text is expand the right side format pane, click Text, find and click the advanced gear dropdown thing, and click the little radio button next to emStrikethrough/em.  It's too much to bear! Just get me a single-click or two-key-combo solution!  <answer264078> On OS X you can assign your own keyboard shortcuts very easily.   Just go to strongSystem Preferences/strong - strongKeyboard/strong - strongShortcuts/strong  Here you can add new shortcut for any application like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/N6n5X.png" alt="Keyboard preferences with custom shortcuts"  <comment330884> You can also go to **Format**  **Font**  **Strikethrough** <comment330886> Unfortunately, there is no shortcut for strikethrough as far as I know. But you can try setting up a shortcut for "Strikethrough" in **System Preferences**.
