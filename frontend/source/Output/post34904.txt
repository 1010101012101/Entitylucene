Is there any way to make the confirmation dialog stop appearing when clearing history in Safari? <body> Every time I clear my history I am presented with a small alert window. Is there any way to avoid/disable this?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/U5Umu.png" alt="History alert that I&#39;d like to avoid"  <answer36109> You could try the "Reset Safari" under Safari settings. Its right below Private Browsing (at least on my computer). you can uncheck everything but clear history. I tried it, and wasn't asked if i was sure I want to clear history.
