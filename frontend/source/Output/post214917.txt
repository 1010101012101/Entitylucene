Editing the /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.pfctl.plist file <body> I need to codevim/code the file found at code/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.pfctl.plist/code but the permissions will not allow it. Even when I run codesudo vim /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.pfctl.plist/code and enter my password, VIM throws me a warning and says that I'm editing a readonly file. Any ideas how to do this?  I'm running OS X 10.11 El Capitain.  <answer214919> Some paths and applications in El Capitan are protected by System Integrity Protection. Even root can't modify the files. You first have to disable SIP before editing or modifying them.  ol liReboot your Mac to Recovery Mode by restarting your computer and holding down kbdCommand/kbdkbdR/kbd until the Apple logo appears on your screen./li liClick Utilities - Terminal./li liIn the Terminal window, enter in codecsrutil disable/code and press kbdEnter/kbd./li liRestart your Mac/li liModify the file(s)/li liReboot your Mac to Recovery Mode by restarting your computer and holding down kbdCommand/kbdkbdR/kbd until the Apple logo appears on your screen./li liClick Utilities - Terminal./li liIn the Terminal window, enter in codecsrutil enable/code and press kbdEnter/kbd./li liRestart your Mac/li /ol  <comment259543> Please add your system version
