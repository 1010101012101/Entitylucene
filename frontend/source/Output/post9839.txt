iPhoto '08 doesn't play video when double-clicked <body> When I import videos from my iPhone into iPhoto '08, I can't play the video inside of iPhoto. The iPhoto Help says to double-click a video to play it, but that doesn't work.  As a workaround, I select "Show File" and then open the video up in QuickTime player, but is there an easier way to view the video from within iPhoto?  <comment41037> What extension does the file have in finder?
