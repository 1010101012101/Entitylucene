Is there a way to queue up the next song on my iPhone? <body> Is there a way to pick which song should play after the current song finishes?   I often browse my music library while listening, and I'll want to play a specific song, but not stop the current song in the middle. Is there a way to queue up a song to start after the current one?  <answer60276> As they say in the iPhone world, "There's an app for that" (Review) :-) It's called OnCue.  <answer61321> This requires just a little preparation: first you need to be playing a playlist.   ul licreate a new playlist/li liadd your first song/li lihit 'Done'/li liPlay the song you've added/li lihit the back button to view the playlist/li lihit 'Edit'/li /ul  At this point you can add and rearrange songs without interrupting playback.  I always miss the function 'Play in iTunes DJ' which iTunes on the Mac has, which would shortcut this whole process.  <answer65421> You could try Play It Next, it does just that.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nflVk.png" alt="Play It Next"  <answer87082> OnTheFly Playlist does exactly what you are asking.  <answer108024> Queue Music does exactly what you are asking for:  <answer131306> You should get the Music Queue Player, this app will solve your problem. It uses the iOS music library and iOS 7 design and allows you to manage queues of songs that you can update whilst playing. You can also save queues. It's the best app of this kind I've seen!
