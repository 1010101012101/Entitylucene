US Extended Input Source missing <body> I'm wanting to type some Pinyin characters (e.g. adding a codebar/code above an codea/code with codeAlt A + A/code) and am following this guide http://pinpinchinese.com/blog/how-to-type-pinyin-tone-marks-mac-os-x-yosemite/  However, I don't see the option of a US Extended Input source. Here's what I do see:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/g7vCB.png" alt="English Input Sources on Mac"  Any suggestions?  Fwiw, I'm running El Capitan 10.11.2 (15C50).  <answer225661> In El Capitan the US Extended keyboard was renamed to ABC Extended.  <comment273882> [Try ABC extended: it's been renamed in later versions of OS X from, US Extended. No idea why this decision was made.](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/120938/wheres-the-us-international-keyboard-on-os-x-10-9-mavericks) <comment273894> @JMY1000  I strongly suspect the name change was done to "de-nationalize" this layout, which can be used for any latin script anywhere. They also added ABC, which is just a denationalized "US".
