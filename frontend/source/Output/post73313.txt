Cannot scan or print from officejet 6500 <body> I was able to scan using officejet 6500 but now, for no obvious reason, the scan icon is grayed out everywhere and I canot print at all. I reinstalled the printer two times but without success.  My printer is an Officejet 6500 e709n It is connected via wifi I'm on OS X 10.9  To install it, I simply clicked on it and the OS manage to do the rest.  <comment85212> Is the printer connected to WiFi, USB or Ethernet? Which OS X version are you running? Did you install the HP drivers from the CO supplied with the printer? Which is the *exact* model of your printer (E709q, E709a, E709n) (open the top cover to see it)? A screenshot of the grayed out icon would be helpful too. <comment85327> Sorry, I realize my description is missing a lot of important points. I'm updating that right now ! Thanks for pointing out the missing elements !
