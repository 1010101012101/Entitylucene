Transferring PC files to MacBook Pro with Lion OS via flash drive <body> I have a flash drive with all the files from my old PC.  How do I access / find this flash drive after it is installed, and can I save and use these files (Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook primarily)?    <answer73903> I'm going to assume you are talking about finding it in Terminal and not Finder as you asked about access /.   Try  precode    cd /Volumes/nameOfFlashDrive /code/pre  That will put you in the / directory of the flash drive. If you don't know the name of the flash drive.  precode    cd /Volumes /code/pre  Then do a ls. Your flash drive should be listed. You could also find the name of the flash drive listed in Finder.  <answer73942> strongAccessing Flash Drive/strong  ol liPlug the flash drive into your Mac./li liOpen a Finder window. (Double click any folder on your desktop, or click the blue face in the Dock.)/li liMove your mouse over the sidebar on the left-hand side of the Finder window, then place two fingers on the trackpad, and scroll down until you see your flash drive./li liClick on your flash drive./li liOpen a new Finder window by pressing kbdCommand/kbd-kbdN/kbd./li liFind the files you want to copy from your flash drive, and drag them to where you want them copied in the second window./li /ol  strongUsing Files/strong  You have a number of options here:  ul liYou can get Microsoft Office for Mac, which will enable you to open, edit and save Word, Excel and PowerPoint documents. /li liIf you prefer something cheaper, there is free open source project called Libre Office, which will let you open, edit and save Word, Excel and PowerPoint documents. Unfortunately there are a few features of Word and PowerPoint that it can't handle, but for most basic documents it should suffice. /li liIf you want a solution that is free, and 100% compatible, you can try Microsoft's new SkyDrive service.
