Changing Metadata of an Epub in iBooks <body> How can I edit the metadata of an Epub file? I would like to alter the title, author, and cover art, similar to how I was able to do so in iTunes (get info).  <answer109997> The current version 1.0.1 of iBooks stores your PDF and epub files in the folder ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.BKAgentService/Data/Documents/iBooks/Books so you should be able to edit the files with the usual suspects.  Additionally, you might still be able add files to iTunes, make the changes you wish and then use iBooks - File - Move Books from iTunes to bring your modified titles into the iBooks storage sandbox.  <answer152133> You can use a piece of software called Calibre to edit the metadata of an epub and then reimport it to iBooks, as long as it was not purchased at a store that uses DRM.  <answer153559> Just started using iBooks on Mac tonight. I was worried about the same thing.  Here's what works:  ul liGo to strongList view/strong in iBooks »/li liClick once on a book (anywhere on the line) »/li liWait a couple of seconds »/li liClick once on the data that you want to change or enter »/li liThat entry will become editable/li /ul  You can edit anything: strongTitle/strong, strongAuthor/strong, strongCategory/strong, etc. Voilà!  <comment186227> What version of iBooks are you using?
