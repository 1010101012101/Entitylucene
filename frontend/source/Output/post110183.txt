What are alternative keyboard shortcuts for Mission Control if you use Xcode? <body> As listed in this question Xcode Keyboard Shortcuts Conflicted there are a lot of Mission Control shortcuts that interfere with Xcode and I was wondering what are some good alternative keyboard shortcuts for Mission Control that don't interfere with Xcode or any other major apps.  <comment129826> if you go to `System Preferences-Keyboard-Shortcuts` you can define your own shortcut for mission control. <comment129827> @RossMcKinley Right. I know how, I need suggestions on what. Thanks for your comment as it will help others who don't know how. <comment129828> Oh sorry, my mistake! It's largely situation specific, since it depends on which apps you use most frequently, and whether you need mission control easily accessible in all of those apps. You could try `alt+ctrl+up`, and then change it again the next time it conflicts. <comment129830> @RossMcKinley Thanks, I'll try that. I also need suggestions on switching spaces left, right, and switching to a specific space (1-8?).
