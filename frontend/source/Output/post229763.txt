Mac repeatedly getting stuck at progress bar <body> I have lately been experiencing this problem on my Mac book pro 13" mid 2010 where it usually hangs and doesn't  resume normal working. I try to restart the computer but it gets stuck at the progress bar. I have tried everything from safe mode boot, PRAM reset, disk utility first aid in recovery and time machine restoration but the problem persists until I reinstall OSX (it worked the last time at least). Now it has hit again. Need suggestions on how to deal with it. I'm using Mac OS X El Capitan and it gets stuck at approximately the 90% mark.  <answer265147> Could be due to kernel extensions you have installed, I had the same issue and posted a blog tutorial on troubleshooting and fixing something like that:  https://smyl.es/how-to-fix-mac-osx-stuckhanging-on-progress-bar-will-not-boot/  <comment280324> What Mac OS X version are you running? From the progress bar stopping, I'm assuming El Capitan. <comment280328> Yes it is el Capitan that's the one Apple provides for OSX reinstall <comment280362> I experienced a similar problem that appeared after I upgraded to El Cap that seemed to be fixed by logging into all the other accounts that existed on my Mac. In my case, the wife and kids had accounts that they hadn't used since the upgrade. IIRC, the problem was that `mds`, the process that indexes for Spotlight (and other things) got hung up somehow at startup. Once `mds` had a chance to index these other accounts, the stall at startup went away. <comment280363> @IconDaemon I do not have any other accounts on my Mac. Is there a way to fix the MDS issue in my case <comment280366> The issue came about because the other accounts _had not logged in_ after the El Cap update was installed. Since you have no additional user accounts on the Mac, this is not a solution. You could try forcibly recreating the Spotlight index on the boot drive in Terminal with this command: `sudo mdutil -E /`  . <comment332441> We're trying to find the best answers and those answers will provide info as to why they're the best.
