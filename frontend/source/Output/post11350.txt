How to make specifics apps password protected even after passcode in iPhone? <body> I have passcode on iphone but sometimes i need to give my iphone to other to make calls. I want to make specific things password protected, things like mail, sms, contacts and some games.  Is it possible?  <answer11857> no, this is not possible, sorry  <answer11870> While there is no way to get this functionality "out of the box", you can take advantage of "Restrictions" to accomplish what you want.   In the Settings App, tap codeGeneral/code, then codeRestrictions/code. You can codeEnable Restrictions/code and then codeDon't Allow Any Apps/code. It's not as convenient, as you have to go through some menus, but it should work.  <comment11869> Apps have to implement that on their own. <comment11878> I don't think that this is possible either. Get a bluetooth headset and share only that for calls instead of your whole iPhone :) <comment12411> Disclaimer: I have not tested this, and I don't know what it would do to existing apps.
