Error in applescript "Invalid index" <body> I have an automator workflow which works fine except for a part of it - applescript.   This is how the workflow goes -  Run applescript (this part works fine) -   precodeon run {input, parameters}      tell application "Mail" to set theMessageText to content of (get first message of inbox)     set x to text ((offset of "9" in theMessageText) + 2) thru ((offset of " " in theMessageText) - 1) of theMessageText end run /code/pre  Set value for variable (The name of the variable is 'number')  Get value for variable (I have made sure that this receives no direct input from previous actions. I am calling the variable 'number' here and I have duplicated this process 2 more times to call 2 more variables)  Run Applescript (This is the code I have problem with) -   precodeon run {input, parameters}     set cat to first item of input     set x to second item of input     set o to third item of input     tell application "Contacts"         set thePerson to make new person with properties {first name:"Testing", last name:"Auto"}         make new phone at end of phones of thePerson with properties {label:"Main", value:x}         repeat with z from 1 to o             set a to item z of cat             add thePerson to group a         end repeat         save     end tell end run /code/pre  The error shown here is "Syntax Error - Can’t get item 2. Invalid index".  The point of the workflow is to get some contact details from an email and add them as a contact in address book (This isn't the full workflow as it is a fairly big one. I have shown only the relevant actions).  I would be grateful for any help.   <answer157522> The values you set before are not given via the codeinput/codeparameter. As long as you run your Automator Workflow as an strongAutomator Workflow/strong and not as an Application or Service, you can access your formerly set variables using the following:  precodetell application "Automator"     set cat to value of variable "NameOfFirstVariable" of front workflow     set x to value of variable "NameOfSecondVariable" of front workflow     set o to value of variable "NameOfThirdVariable" of front workflow end tell /code/pre  inside your "Run Applescript" action.  Greetings, Michael / Hamburg  <comment185373> I tried this but I get the following error "Can’t get item 2 of {3}". The problem seems to be in retrieving the second variable. The "Get value of Variable" action seems to be working fine. Every time I run the program, after the error dialog box, "item z" part of the code is highlighted. Any idea what is happening over here? Thanks for the help @ShooTerKo <comment185893> You try `set a to item z of cat` inside `repeat with z from 1 to o`. It simply looks like `o` has a value greater than the amount of items in the list cat...
