iPad2 Digitizer Cable removal <body> I am working on an iPad 2. I just pulled the screen digitizer cable, and it did not come out as clean as I wanted too. Could someone please look at this picture and give me an opinion. There seems to be some small wires iterlaced between the connector cables at the top. It is different than the one below. Did I destroy the connectors?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZhK5i.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment319689> That's very blurry, any chance you can get a better photo of it?
