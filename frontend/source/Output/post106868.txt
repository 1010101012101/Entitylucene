Time Machine requesting way too much disk space for initial backup <body> Using Time Machine on OSX Server 10.5.3, attempting to back up to a Time Machine enabled AFP volume on a NAS running NetaTalk on OpenIndiana 151a8.   The volume that needs to be backed up is a DAS RAID that has 5.29 TB of files. The Time Machine volume is 9TB, all of which is free space.  When attempting to back up this volume, Time Machine is requesting 12.44 TB [235% of actual size of the data to be backed up] of space, causing the backup to fail.  precode10/25/13 10:54:13 AM /System/Library/CoreServices/backupd[14737] Backup content     size: 15.6 GB excluded items size: 80 KB for volume SSD  10/25/13 10:54:13 AM /System/Library/CoreServices/backupd[14737] Backup content size: 5293.8 GB excluded items size: 0 bytes for volume Jobs  10/25/13 10:54:13 AM /System/Library/CoreServices/backupd[14737] Compacting storage: 12.44 TB requested (including padding), 8.88 TB available before compacting  10/25/13 10:54:13 AM /System/Library/CoreServices/backupd[14737] Stopping backup.  10/25/13 10:54:19 AM /System/Library/CoreServices/backupd[14737] Backup canceled. /code/pre  When displaying the error dialog, it says this: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/54ACO.png" alt="enter image description here"  Do newer versions of Time Machine request less padding? I haven't the slighted idea why it would need to much extra space.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.
