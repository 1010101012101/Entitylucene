Cannot debug configd <body> To debug codeconfigd/code it is suggested by man page to run it using   precode$ usr/libexec/configd -d  /code/pre  And you would kill it before launching it using codeSIGTERM/code otherwise it will launch again as follows:  precode$ sudo killall -SIGTERM configd      /code/pre  From man page of configd   precode SIGNALS  configd was designed to run without any intervention but if you insist on sending a signal to the dae-mon daemon  mon then the following are available:   SIGHUP   This signal, typically used to tell a daemon to reload its configuration, is ignored (there is           no configuration).   SIGTERM  This signal initiates a "graceful" shutdown of the daemon. /code/pre   Problem is that codeSIGTERM/code is not gracefully killing configd. It is restarting right back up. Do you guys know any solution?  I also tried killing codelaunchctl/code  precode$ sudo launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.configd.plist Password: /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.configd.plist: Operation not permitted while System Integrity Protection is engaged /code/pre  Also tried to disable codesystem integrity protection/code for testing but failed:  precode$ sudo csrutil disable csrutil: failed to modify system integrity configuration. This tool needs to be executed from the Recovery OS. /code/pre  My platform  precode$ sw_vers  ProductName:    Mac OS X ProductVersion: 10.11.6 BuildVersion:   15G1004 /code/pre  <answer256074> You can't turn off SIP on a running macOS system. You need to boot into the Recovery partition and run the codecsrutil/code command. This page at Macworld details the steps nicely.     ol   liRestart your Mac. /li   liBefore OS X starts up, hold down Command-R and keep it held down until you see an Apple icon and a progress bar.

This should be more of a comment. <comment319213> You need to stop SIP before you can kill `launchctl`, which is something you need to do to keep troubleshooting. <comment319218> I googled that error code and found the steps to disable SIP. But my question is there any other way without restarting it. Why is configd not getting killed gracefully.
