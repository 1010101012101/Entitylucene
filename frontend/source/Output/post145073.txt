How do I get Word 2011 back after Microsoft Autoupdate froze? <body> I had a Microsoft Autoupdate freeze after the end, and after a reboot, Word won't start.  How can I reset to a currently updated Office?  <comment170925> Is Word the only affected application? Do you have the original Office 2011 Installer media? Have you tried recovering the Word app from a Time Machine backup? <comment170933> The Time Machine backup restored from yesterday, before the update began, is behaving exactly like it did before I tried to restore. <comment170934> Sorry, I mistook which version was restored. It appears to be working now.
