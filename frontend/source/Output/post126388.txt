How to export Excel 2011 keyboard shortcuts? <body> I customized my Excel 2011 shortcuts on my MacBook Pro and just wanted to have the same productivity level on my Mac Mini.   Is there a way I can export my Excel 2011 shortcuts or will I have to manually set them a second time?   I customized my shortcuts using System Preferences (I already manually set these 3 keyboard shortcuts again in Excel 2011 on my Mac Mini) or via the Customize Keyboard Shortcuts pane ( the one in the Tools menu if I remember well).  <comment148012> How did you customize your shortcuts ? <comment148024> are we talking about keyboard shortcuts? <comment171598> The question is "How to export Excel 2011 keyboards shortcuts?" So, I believe, yes, we are talking about keyboards shortcuts. <comment171599> @MatthieuRiegler Via Excel keyboard shortcuts panel + Apple system preferences keyboard shortcuts panel.
