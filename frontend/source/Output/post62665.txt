Midi in browser on Mountain Lion <body> I recently moved on Mountain Lion. It seems that the OS does not allow midi playback in browser anymore. I can't find more informations but this threads: 1 ; 2  Can you help me to find a solution to get back my good old midi files in web pages?  <answer68340> Chrome still allows this, Safari doesn't. It is a per-browser configuration. To my knowledge, Safari does not currently have an option to re-enable this.
