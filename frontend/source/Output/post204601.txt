Blank dock, command+tab menu icon for application - RubyMine 7.0 <body> I'm having a problem with the application icon for Jetbrains' RubyMine 7.0 not showing up in the dock.  img src="https://photos-3.dropbox.com/t/2/AAB98qSAaMeBfxndC2QVq7JvhO4KA-0imauQ4J_M2syFTg/12/23192604/png/32x32/1/1441562400/0/2/Screenshot%202015-09-06%2012.03.21.png/CJzIhwsgASACIAcoASgCKAc/9UZ4c9tj2JC8XduYE6JYeLpnT2vpPaYDf4eEbWXmMjk?size=1280x960&amp;size_mode=2" alt="blank dock icon"  This used to work just fine before I cloned/renamed the user accounts on my Mac, running Yosemite.  One of my user accounts is able to see the icon in the dock, the other is not.  I believe the problem is with the account that was cloned from the original account.  Things I've tried:  ul liFixing permissions through diskutility/li liUninstalling application, deleting all ~/Library files for the app and reinstalling./li li`chown -R  ~/ (to ensure proper file ownership after account clone/rename)/li /ul  Help is appreciated.  EDIT: Just to add a few other things:  ul liSometimes, for seemingly no reason, the application icon will reappear in the dock.  As strange as it sounds, there is no obvious action that causes it to come back.  It will certainly disappear shortly after./li liThe icon is also missing from application dialogs and from the command+tab switching menu./li /ul  img src="https://photos-1.dropbox.com/t/2/AACPpBIv5i64UWSkyb_IloX_2NjYC3BQj_Jd41VdEa0q_w/12/23192604/png/32x32/1/_/1/2/Screenshot%202015-09-08%2020.23.16.png/EIiouBEYg99CIAEoAQ/ZqZaf300Em2M35LX7rDxEuNGG6j8bHEL6dxu8iMhWQc?size=1280x960&amp;size_mode=2" alt="missing from dialog"  <answer204616> I recover from all sort of temporary dock corruption by killing the dock after saving work and getting ready to restart the Mac.  ul licodekillall Dock/code from terminal app/li lilog out and back in/li lirestart the Mac/li /ul  Barring that, you've got more serious corruption, but let's start with the easy steps first.  <comment246644> Can you see the app's icon in /Applications? Is it just when the app is on the dock that the icon is gone? <comment246646> Yep. It's there in /Applications. On the dock it's missing. It's also missing from the command+tab menu for switching between apps. <comment247114> Nope.  Unfortunately @bmike, that didn't work. <comment250378> I did end up resolving the issue, though I'm not sure exactly what I changed.  I was altering some file permissions (somewhere in /Library I think) while troubleshooting my homebrew setup, and this issue got resolved as well.
