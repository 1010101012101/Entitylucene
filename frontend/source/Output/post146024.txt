They've simply moved over to a different location in the Photos app: Collections. Collections, which organizes all of your photos by date and location, is Apple's attempt at making photos more organized and searchable.   It appears that PhotoStream has gone &amp; only the last 30 days will be stored by default.  <answer150308> to delete the pics from just your photostream, follow these steps....it works for me....lame though.....i wish they would give you the option to just have a friggin "camera roll" and "photostream"....  ul liTake a photo with one iDevice/li liCheck to see it in the Recently Added on both iDevices/li liDelete it on one device (goes to Recently Deleted on that device)/li liCheck Recently Added on the other device to see if it is gone/li liCheck Recently Deleted on the other device to make sure it doesn't show up there/li liRestore the deleted photo from the Recently Deleted folder so it shows back up in Recently Added/li liCheck the other device to make sure it doesn't reappear in that device's Recently Added/li /ul  boom.... :)  <comment176918> now instead of two steps....you have seven......grrrrr...
