Use one AppleScript to toggle on and off (1 or 0) <body> I'm wondering if there's a simple way to use one AppleScript program to turn something on and off. Basically I want it to do this.  precodeCheck current pmset sms if sms = 0  then     do shell script sudo pmset -a sms 1 if sms = 1 then     do shell script sudo pmset -a sms 0 /code/pre  How would I tell it to check the current value?  <answer132551> To get the state I would use something like:  precodeset sms to (do shell script"pmset -g |grep \"sms\" | awk '{print $2}'") /code/pre  Then:  precodeif sms is "0" then   do shell script"pmset -a sms 1" with administrator privileges else   do shell script"pmset -a sms 0" with administrator privileges end if /code/pre  Note the "administrator privileges"  this is used  because you will not be able to use 'sudo' because there will be no interface for you to type your password.  The "administrator privileges" will display a Normal OS Authentication dialogue for you to enter the user name and password.  <answer132555> precodeset cur_state to do shell script "pmset -g" with administrator privileges if cur_state = 1 then     do shell script "pmset -a sms 0" with administrator privileges else if cur_state = 0 then     do shell script "pmset -a sms 1" with administrator privileges end if /code/pre  <comment156966> what is that a infinite loop ? <comment156994> This will not work:  do shell script "pmset -g" will return ALL settings
