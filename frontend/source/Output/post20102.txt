How can I replicate Windows End/Home key? <body> How can I replicate Windows Home/End keys to use to jump to the end of a line or use Shift to highlight to the end or start of a line  <answer20105> The shortcuts you're looking for are listed on this very handy article in the Apple KB. Hope it helps.  <answer20114> I used the following a lot.  kbd⌘CMD/kbd+kbdꜛ/kbd: Home  kbd⌘CMD/kbd+kbd↓/kbd: End  kbd⌘CMD/kbd+kbd←/kbd: Beginning of Line  kbd⌘CMD/kbd+kbd→/kbd: End of Line  These I learned the other day from here - very handy for coding and writing, these are emacs bindings which work on Macs.  kbdCTRL/kbd+kbdA/kbd: beginning of line.  kbdCTRL/kbd+kbdE/kbd: end of line.  kbdCTRL/kbd+kbdU/kbd: delete from cursor to beginning of line.  kbdCTRL/kbd+kbdK/kbd: delete from cursor to end of line.  kbdCTRL/kbd+kbdW/kbd: erase word to the left.  kbdCTRL/kbd+kbdT/kbd: transpose characters around cursor.  <answer20357> These can actually be mapped globally for most applications by creating entries in code~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict/code  But this guy created a handy little packaged script called Keyfixer that sets up the bindings in the way you describe (with some additional Control and Shift modifiers.) I threw it in my Dropbox and run it on any Mac I have to use. Since the preferences are per-user you don't have to worry about screwing up someone else's keys.  <answer83093> With MacBook Air (the 2012 model at least) the best solution I found was the free KeyRemap4MacBook utility -- it lets you change the keyboard in many ways, and I settled with "fn + cursor left/right" for Home/End and "fn + up/down" for PgUp/PgDown.
