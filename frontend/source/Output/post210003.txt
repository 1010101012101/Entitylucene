App to display IP address in menu bar? <body> I deal with a lot of external servers where the firewall must be configured to allow SSH access.  I frequently need to know my external IP address, and it changes often.  Does anyone know of an application that will determine my external IP address and display it in the menu bar?  preferably with a copy to clipboard option?  I'd write one myself but Objective-C is not my thing.  <answer210005>    This small application runs in the background and shows the current IP   dddress of your Mac in the menu bar. There are options available to   customize the appearance of the menu entry. The IP dddress is updated   regulary. Switch on the Router option if you are behind a router or   gateway. You can still see your local IP address in the menu.   https://www.monkeybreadsoftware.de/Software/IPinmenubar.shtml     Do you need your computers IP address often?
