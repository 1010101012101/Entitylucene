iPhone: get Internet via Bluetooth <body> Is it possible to get the internet connection via Bluetooth (PAN) on an iPhone 3gs ? Note: I'm not asking about sharing the iPhone's internet connection via bluetooth to other devices; I want to do the opposite.  <answer135495> ol liPair your iDevice and Mac (Turn Bluetooth on for both devices, setup Bluetooth device, etc.)/li liNow go to Bluetooth Preferences. You should see your iDevice in the list of devices./li liClick on the iDevice and then click the gear at the bottom of the list (next to + and -). There will be an option called "Update Services."/li liClick "Update Services" option AND press the the "Device" that is your computer on your iPad under the list of devices in SystemPreferences/General/Bluetooth. (Ex. on the iPad, under system preferences/general/bluetooth I have a list of 2 devices, Apple Wireless Keyboard and MBP. I press MBP to attempt to connect using the iPad)/li liFor some reason, Updating Services makes the two connect. You'll get the two linked rings in the top left corner next to "iPad" or "iPod" or "iPhone."/li /ol  There's an excellent thread in the Apple Community forums about how to do that:   https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3125423
