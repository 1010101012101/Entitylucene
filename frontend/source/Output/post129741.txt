iOS App Store: free limited version of app <body> I would like to have a free trial version of my app, with limited functionality, and at the same time to have a full paid version. The apps can have slightly different names on App Store, say codeMyApp 1.0/code and codeMyApp 1.0 (Limited)/code.  Does this violate Apple's policies?   <answer129745> You are permitted to have free, lite versions of your app in the App Store.  However, demo/trial versions are prohibited per the App Store Guidelines.     strong2.9/strong Apps that are "beta", "demo", "trial", or "test" versions will be rejected   <comment151846> Any experience with submitting two apps like you said? <comment151847> @mojuba There are many apps on the App Store that do this: [CamScanner Free](https://itunes.apple.com/app/camscanner-free/id388627783?mt=8) and [CamScanner Pro](https://itunes.apple.com/app/camscanner-pro/id395904807?mt=8) is a good example. If you're hoping *I've* submitted two apps in this way, so far I use IAPs. <comment151850> Interesting, the overviews for both apps look identical. I couldn't find any mentioning of what exactly the difference is between free vs. pro version, except both overviews mention some monthly subscription. But that has nothing to do with the price of the app itself, right? <comment151851> @mojuba I have both apps installed and there are features the Pro version includes that the Free version doesn't, outside of a premium subscription: no ads, no watermark, etc. <comment151862> Obviously there should be some difference, it's just looking at their app store descriptions I can't see any info on that. Are they trying to trick the app store or the users? or both? :) Anyway, thanks, I think I know what to do now! <comment151882> An alternative is to have one app that does both but behaves like tyne limited version until the user does an in app purchase to allow them to use more functions
