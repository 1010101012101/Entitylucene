PostScript questions on Macs with either Preview or Macghostview <body> 1)  The PC implementation of Ghostview has a "Safer" option, checked by default, that prevents file creation (so that running a .ps file can't hurt anything in the environment).  One must uncheck "Safer" to run PostScript files that create files or one gets an invalidfileaccess error.    What is the equivalent of unchecking "Safer" in either or both of the OSX PostScript viewers mention in the title?  2)  If a PostScript program contains an error, where to Preview put (hide?!?!) the error message?  <answer113956> I just started using codeMacGhostView/code and I have hand-generated code.ps/code files that run other code.ps/code files using the coderun/code command. I get codeError: /invalidfileaccess in --run--/code in a message window. By default the codeSAFER/code option for ghostscript is usually enabled in all versions of GhostView, which this app is based on. It is a security precaution that prevents a script from reading/writing from/to a file. I tried adding the code-dNOSAFER/code option, which is what you would use with ghostscript, to codePreferences-&gt;gv parameters/code but it didn't work. Looking through all the menu items, I finally found codeOptions-&gt;Show gv parameters/code which displayed the options for this app. The code-dNOSAFER/code option is replaced by code-nosafer/code in this app. I don't know why they would change any of the options from the original syntax but all of them are like this. I added this option to codePreferences-&gt;gv parameters/code and now I can open all my files. I also added code-media=LETTER/code and code-resize/code (separated by spaces) so by default I get a letter-size canvas within a fit window.  I can't open my code.ps/code files that violate the codeSAFER/code option in codePreview/code because there is no way to change the options in the app. The ones that do not violate this option seem to be converted to codepdf/code before being displayed. I much prefer codeMacGhostView/code.
