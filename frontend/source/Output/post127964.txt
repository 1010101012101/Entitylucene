QuickLook set app to display preview <body> Is it possible to set the app that displays the QuickLook preview in OS X?    I'm developing iOS apps and I have Xcode installed, but when I open the QuickLook preview of a Source-Code file, the preview uses the iA Writer, which I have also installed but the "Open with" button un the top right corner shows Xcode.    Info: I'm using a MacBook Air, Late 2010, OS X 10.9.2  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aowDT.png" alt="Ql with iA Writer"  If I uninstall iA Writer it looks like this  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mw54U.png" alt="no IA writer"  Question:  How do I tell the Quick Look NOT to use the iA Writer (without having to uninstall it)?  <answer127976> h2qlmanage/h2  Use the command line tool qlmanage to investigate your QuickLook set up, including the default generator for each file format.     qlmanage -- Quick Look Server debug and management tool   Apple's QuickLook developer documentation provides a good overview of how QuickLook works and how to test specific plugins.  h3Editing the iA Writer QuickLook Plugin/h3  You may want to edit the iA Writer QuickLook plugin to disassociate it from your code.h/code and code.m/code files. See QuickLook file associations for more information about achieving this.  <answer127981> Try this  ol liselect the file and press cmd+I./li liThen under "Open with" select the application you want to open in QuickLook./li liAnd then press the "Change All..." button/li /ol  <answer155111> This answer is coming a lot later, but I had to figure this out for myself.

What does the iA write has to do with it? What app do you want to open with QL? <comment149929> I want it not to use iA Writer for the preview. If I uninstall iA Writer, it looks like this: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/ejo7ifvdvospqto/Screenshot%202014-04-18%2011.48.28.png <comment149937> when you RIGHT click on the Open with, what options do you see ? <comment149938> I see this: https://www.dropbox.com/s/clpszxhh1nkc92f/Screenshot%202014-04-18%2012.44.53.png <comment150070> This only changes the application that opens the file when you doubleclick on it, it doesn't affect the QuickLook Plugin.
