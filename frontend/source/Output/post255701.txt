I don't know my SSH key passphrase cause Keychain managed it (pre-Sierra). What do I do now? <body> After Sierra update, a new bug was found where codessh-agent/code no longer remembers the passphrase for keys added. Not surprised by their answer, Apple stated strongTL;DR: is not a bug, but a feature/strong.  Many threads I've read revolves around using codessh-agent -A/-K/code but the problem is not the loading, but that I never wrote my passphrase down anywhere.   What do I do now? Can I retrieve my passphrase from Keychain?  PD: strongThe reason I don't know my passphrase is/strong the whole point of the setup was not to write down a passphrase but let keychain manage it in order to centralize passwords, as I followed some best practiced (I think it was GitHub's?) where they mentioned "using easy to remember passphrases are easy to crack; using random letters/number/symbols are hard to remember so you most likely will write it down, which is also insecure. The solution is letting keychain manage it" or something like that.  <answer255704> Nevermind, I just found this Leaving this open in case anybody panic as I did.  strongSteps:/strong  ol liOpen Keychain/li liSearch for "SSH"/li liDouble click on the SSH file you want/li liSelect strongShow password/strong on the bottom-left corner/li liUnlock your keychain with the administrative password./li /ol  <comment318505> Nevermind, I just found this https://help.github.com/articles/how-do-i-recover-my-ssh-key-passphrase/.
