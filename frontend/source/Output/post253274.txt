SD card History <body> I have lost my SD card. I want to know when it has been used last.  Is there a way of showing up when which sd or usb device has been conectet to the mac ? Thanks for Help.  <answer253276> Most activity like this will be logged in code/var/log/system.log/code.  You can use code/Applications/Utilities/Console.app/code to view the logs and search for specific messages - most disks would be mounted under /Volumes, so that's a good keyword to start looking for/  By default your system logs will go back about a week or so.
