Mac Pro (2013- black can) and non mac monitor? <body> I am looking to buy a Mac Pro here in the next month but I'd like to use a Samsung 4k monitor. It has 2, HDMI ports and 1 Displayport. I understand the Mac Pro has thunderbolt2 ports, which, correct me if I'm wrong are the same type of port. Can I take advantage of the 4k capabilities of the samsung using a display port to thundebolt2 connection? thx  <answer196390> Given no detail on the Samsung display, it seems like you should be able to. Thunderbolt ports can handle Displayport connections. The tech specs for the machine claim 3x5k, so a single 4k should be fine. You'll need a Mini DisplayPort to DisplayPort cable.
