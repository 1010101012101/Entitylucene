How to configure proxy settings for a specific network? <body> A network I connect to requires configuring proxy settings to reach the Internet.   When I configure those settings within the codeAutomatic/code location, it applies to every network I connect to.   Is there a way to apply those settings only to this specific network so when I connect to it those proxy settings work and when I connect to another network they do not?  <answer224038> You need to make specific network configuration:  precodeSystem Preferences &gt; Network &gt; Location: &gt; Edit Locations... /code/pre  left down kbd+/kbd button, enter a new netowrk configuration name, for example codeOffice / Wi-Fi + proxy/code, choose it and configure it with the proxy setting you need.  You will have to make 2 emnetwork configurations/em one to go through your proxy, and one without. Example: codeOffice / Ethernet + proxy/code, codeHome / Wi-fi - proxy/code.  You will notice that you have a new menu entry:  precodeï£¿ &gt; Location /code/pre  and you will be able to choose the correct emnetwork configuration/em which fits your actual network use.  To avoid most of the problems caused by the codeAutomatic/code predefined network configuration, I advise you to inactivate completly network interfaces you don't use. For example codeBluetooth/code doesn't have to be configured and open to network access if you don't use it yourself, and you don't control who uses it.   <comment271730> Yes I did. However, your answer below worked fine. I was just expecting a way to do it without switching locations or anything. I thought there might be something I can do to make the proxy settings run whenever I connect to the intended network. <comment271779> There might be a way for you to achieve this once you have built and tested the required network configurations. Look at [ControlPlane](http://www.controlplaneapp.com/), and if you find a satisfying solution, post here a more appropriate answer :). <comment271780> I removed your hardware and MacOS X indications, since your question is relevant for more than 6 different versions of MacOS X. <comment343485> This really helps me a lot.
