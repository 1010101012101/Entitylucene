Mail.app performance after upgrade to Lion <body> I am having some big issues with Mail.app after upgrade to Lion. Performance is horrible.  When i open a message, cpu usage grows up to 150% See monitor activity screenshot  I already tried to repair permissions and remove all accounts to recreate it but it didn't make any difference.  I'm using 2 accounts with imap. The total messages on inbox is 12.000. Before upgrade, it was running fine.  Anyone experiencing this? Any ideas of what should i do?  <answer19726> If you open the Mail's Activity window (keyboard shortcut: kbdCommand/kbd+kbd0/kbd), what does it show that justifies the 150% CPU figure?  <comment21644> This is curious. Have you tried rebuilding the database? I have almost 60 000 items in my mailbox. <comment21667> Give it some time to optimize performance. <comment21693> Have patience, the Lion's Mail has to upgrade the Mail database and it 12k items (and no knowledge of your hardware) that could take a while. Plus, Spotlight wants to upgrade too, the LaunchDB will want to upgrade, everybody wants to upgrade at the same time :) <comment21888> @Randolph West Thank you! Rebuilding the database did the trick. It's running fine now. <comment21897> Glad I could help.
