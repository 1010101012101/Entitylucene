Get full url address on Safari <body> In Yosemite, the new Safari "hides" part of the URL, how could I show it without going to the address bar every time?  e.g. strongcodehttps://www.google.com.br/?gfe_rd=cr&amp;ei=p9lIVJbjCYiX8QfnpoCgBQ#q=stackexchange/code/strong becomes strongcodegoogle.com.br/code/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ohg7O.png" alt="shorten"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zMDuV.png" alt="open"  <answer152481> I found the solution, right after posting...  Go to Safari → Preferences → Advanced → Show Full Website URL  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nRmyN.png" alt="Preferences"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hShdU.png" alt="Show full url"
