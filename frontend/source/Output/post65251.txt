Copy app URL in iPhone <body> There is a way from App store to send an email containing the information about an app. However there is no way of just copying the app URL in case I want to send that URL on other services like Line or whatever. Or is there?  <answer65252> At least in the App Store app in iOS 6 you can copy the link by tapping on the Sharing icon.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KhAAK.png" width="300" /  If this is not available in earlier versions there is always the option of sending a mail to oneself and taking the link from there.  <comment76641> You are right. It's possible to copy the link in the iOS email client by long tapping the app icon. (iOS 5.1)
