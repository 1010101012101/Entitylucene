Messages wont open: the Messages database is being updated <body> Recently on my new macbook when I try to open up the messages app it won't let me open it and gives me the error:  precodeMessages is updating...  The Messages database is being upgraded, please wait while it finishes or Quit Messages and relaunch it later. /code/pre  And no matter what I do it won't go away and work.  I have tried to copy over the messages folder in Library from another computer but it didn't help at all. this is really starting to bug me and I would appreciate any help towards fixing this issue.  My macbook is running the latest version of Yosemite and is the 2014 edition  <answer228236> I've been getting the same thing on and off for a long time now. I wait for any period of time and still get the same, most always a reboot of the system makes it work again...frustrating!  I'm running El Capitan 10.11.3  <comment196594> how long did you wait before making it start over?
