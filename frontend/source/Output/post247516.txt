Dimming chase on Applescript <body> I would like to create an automated brightness/dimming chase on my Mac OS Yosemite 10.10.5 using Applescript,  I found this script  strongDimmer:/strong tell application "System Events"         key code 107     end tell   strongBrighter:/strong tell application "System Events"         key code 113     end tell  What I would like to do now is to repeat that action and control the speed/timeframe of the dimming,   Any Applescript expert able to help on that?  Thanks!!!  <answer247536> Only because you asked... The emcode/em below is an example of using a coderepeat/code emstatement/em and codedelay/code emcommands/em with your emcode/em.  That said, I do not believe it is going to give you the desired results because while the events will trigger in code nonetheless they'll probably not be processed at the hardware level. (It doesn't on my system.)  You can change the numeric value in the coderepeat/code emstatement/em to suite your needs. The emvalue/em is an eminteger/em, as in coderepeat integer [times]/code.  The codedelay/code emcommand/em shown in emdecimal seconds/em as in codedelay number/code being the number of seconds to delay. The number may be fractional, such as 0.5 to delay half a second.  hr  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"coderepeat 3 times     repeat 10 times         tell application "System Events"             key code 107         end tell         delay (0.1)     end repeat     repeat 10 times         tell application "System Events"             key code 113         end tell         delay (0.1)     end repeat end repeat /code/pre  <comment305564> Hey cool, thanks !!! this is really helpful!
