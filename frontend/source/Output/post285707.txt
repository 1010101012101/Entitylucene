Is there a way to sort files by date and always keeping folders listed on top regardless of date? <body> I know there's an option to keep folders on top when arranging by name, but I like to arrange by date. When I do, I'd prefer not to have folders separated by date, but to always keep them on top.  strongJust to clarify:/strong I'm not talking about using TotalFinder or if macOS Sierra has this option built in and I'm not wanting to sort by name. I want folders on top when sorting by Date Modified.  strongQuestion:/strong Is there any way, tweak, or software to sort files by date but keeping folders always on top!  <comment360408> I've linked this the canonical post explaining why folders get sorted with files. If you edit this with a screen shot or details why the linked post doesn't cover your hold will be reviewed automatically. Be sure to address if you are on Sierra or newer and have used the preferences to keep folders together as described here : https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/54759/how-do-you-get-mac-os-finder-to-group-folders-together-when-sorting
