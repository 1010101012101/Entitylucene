Restore iMessages from Mac to iPhone <body> I was in the process of upgrading the software on an iPhone.  For some reason in the process of updating this phone there was an error and the device completely wiped itself. Using the restore from an iCloud backup informs me that there was never a device backup made.   What I am left with is as follows:  ol liA Mac with all my iMessages intact/li liAn iPhone with Contacts and Photos somehow synced over/li /ol  strongI was hoping to see if there was a way to move all these iMessages back onto the iPhone, or force sync this data somehow (all the data is tied to one appleID which is setup on both devices)./strong  I feel lost at this point, and have unfortunately already lost more data than I'd like to admit.  Just to add, there isn't a physical iTunes backup on the mac either.
