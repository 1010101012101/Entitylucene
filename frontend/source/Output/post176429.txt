Any alternatives to Quicken with auto download of transactions? <body> Quicken for Mac continues to suck, so I'm wondering if there are any viable alternatives.  I've tried a few, but none of them are able to automatically download activity from banks ("Direct Connect"). Yes, you can manually download an OFX/QFX from the bank's website, but I want the app to pull down the data without me having to go to a browser.  stronggnuCash/strong seems to theoretically be able to do it, but it's incredibly complicated, ugly, and I couldn't get it to work.  <comment208299> Did you search for "OFX" in the Mac App Store already? <comment208348> @patrix Yes, but nothing comparable in there. <comment208542> I've tried several as well, and none of them have met my needs.  I run Quicken for Windows in a VM.  It's more fully-featured and less error-prone, in my experience. :/
