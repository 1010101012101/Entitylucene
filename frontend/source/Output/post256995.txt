Safari displays wrong color according to Digital Color Meter <body> I have the following HTML snippet open in Safari. Digital Color Meter reports the color as #FEDC53.  precode&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt;     &lt;title&gt;Broken Colors?&lt;/title&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body style="background-color: #FFDD44"&gt; Hello, World! &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; /code/pre  Is Safari displaying the incorrect color? Or is Digital Color Meter displaying reading the wrong color? How do I find out? How do I fix this?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/er1my.png" alt="enter image description here"  Comparative true FFDD44 swatch, with sRGB profile embedded.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bBICB.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer257031> Digital Color Monitor is working correctly.  I created your test page and displayed it in Google Chrome v53.0.2785.143, and it reported FFDD44.  The same page in Safari reported, for me, F4E14F. Looking at them next to each other, they don't even look like the same color. (In the screenshot, Chrome is the outer window, Safari the inner.)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7qBsJ.png" alt="enter image description here"  It appears that the reason is gamma correction in the browser. See the Gamma Test Page. This page displays correctly (in the sense that each block is a solid color) in Safari v9.1.3, whereas it displays incorrectly in Chrome v53.0.2785.143. See screenshots below. Based on the information on the Gamma Test Page, Safari is correctly gamma-correcting CSS colors.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zv1js.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6pb1X.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment320711> Questions need to be more specific than 'what gives?'.  Please take a look at [ask] for tips on how to ask questions as well as what type of questions are considered 'off-topic' for this site. <comment320751> What versions of Safari and macOS are you using? <comment320764> Nice answer. Something slightly puzzles me [not enough for a separate question;) My screen is hardware calibrated to sRGB. All the values on that test page are within 1, on the interior & exterior colours if I use sRGB in the DCM. If I use Native, they're miles out.   Is Native only useful for an uncalibrated monitor, relying on the default profile? <comment320769> On that picture, my meter gives F8DE5A in native, FFDE44 in sRGB, on an sRGB calibrated monitor. I added a swatch of true FFDD44 with embedded sRGB profile for comparison. [which also now reads as FFDE44 suggesting it's time I recalibrated;) Is your monitor calibrated & if so, to what?
