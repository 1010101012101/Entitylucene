Console messages "warning: we're on the slow path" from syncdefaultsd <body> My MacBook (Mid-2010 model) has been sluggish lately and so I decided to check the console to see what was going on. Here is what I found, multiple times:  4/15/14 9:52:55.488 PM syncdefaultsd[20962]: -[IAPluginManager allAListPlugins] [546] -- em*/em warning: we're on the slow path.  Any idea on what this might be related to?  <comment149621> Are there any kernel messages relating to I/O errors? <comment149769> I don't see any I/O errors.
