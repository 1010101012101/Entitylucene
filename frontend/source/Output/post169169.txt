Compose an email with an inline image <body> Some time ago I managed to force Mail to always put attachments at the end of the email. Now I would like to revert this setting.  As I don't find anything in the GUI (preferences) I suppose that I changed some preferences with the terminal.  I see that I have codeAttachAtEnd=1/code in my preferences  precode&gt; defaults read com.apple.mail  | grep AttachAtEnd AttachAtEnd = 1; /code/pre  But it seems that I am not able to change it  precode&gt; defaults write com.apple.com AttachAtEnd -bool No &gt; defaults read com.apple.mail  | grep AttachAtEnd AttachAtEnd = 1; /code/pre  or  precode&gt; defaults delete com.apple.com AttachAtEnd &gt; defaults read com.apple.mail  | grep AttachAtEnd AttachAtEnd = 1; /code/pre  How can I remove it?  <answer169170> Looks like you're using codecom.apple.com/code rather than codecom.apple.mail/code in your codedefaults write/code or codedefaults delete/code commands.  codedefaults delete com.apple.mail AttachAtEnd/code should do the trick.  <comment198622> Thanks I really don't know where the typo is coming from... <comment353209> How did you manage to NOT inline your attachments?
