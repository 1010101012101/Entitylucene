OS X Server share: a couple of users create folders with problematic permissions <body> We are narrowing down a problem on our 10.5.2-server-connected Pegasus R4.  A couple of users, when creating folders on the share, do so with unintended permissions. The folder should presumably be made with "Staff Read and Write".  Instead, with these problematic users, the folder is created with, for example:  "James Read and Write" "Staff Read Only".  This is a problem for anyone else wanting to change the folder and it's contents!  I can see nothing wrong with the user accounts in Server.app. They look like everyone else.  Anyone have a solution? My best guess at this point is to create new profiles for these users, which is going to be a PITA.  Thanks!
