How to find .bashrc or .zshrc? <body> I just got a MacBook Pro and am in the process of trying to get GNU commands installed. I'm following this guide, but I don't know how to do:  Then add the following line to your code.bashrc/code or code.zshrc/code:  precodeexport PATH="$(brew --prefix coreutils)/libexec/gnubin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH" /code/pre  I did a codecd; ls -a/code and I don't see any files called code.bashrc/code or code.zshrc/code.    Additional Info: br Running Yosemite 10.10.3 on a MacBook Pro. Already have Xcode installed. Total newbie at this.  <answer181569> To know which shell are you using, use the following command:  precode$ echo $SHELL /code/pre  It will return something like:  precode/bin/bash /code/pre  or  precode/bin/zsh /code/pre  After you know the shell, if the file code.bashrc/code or code.zshrc/code doesn't exist in your home directory (codeecho $HOME/code to find out), just create it.  If you are using codebash/code, you may have a file called code.bash_profile/code where you can put your codeexport/code command instead (don't know in codezsh/code).  <answer181833> Create your .bashrc with your text editor &amp; add any files you want. Go to terminal and type in: ls -a   It will show some hidden files.  <comment216265> Mine returns to /bin/bash, but I don't have a .bashrc. How and where do I create it? I do remember seeing a .bash_profile somewhere after doing 'ls -a' but I don't remember how I got there <comment220775> This may sound condescending/patronizing/etc, but that’s not my intent at all. It may come off as such nevertheless, but really it’s not. Bottom line: if you have to ask this question, you shouldn’t be installing `brew` at all. My advice, though not mutually exclusive, is to [learn bash & the unix shell](http://www.amazon.com/Learning-bash-Shell-Programming-Nutshell/dp/0596009658) - interactively - then proceed to creating scripts, add formulae, and modifying your working environment as you like. Cheers (from one newbie to another `;)` ) <comment220807> @TommyK create it in your user dir, using `touch ~/.bashrc`
