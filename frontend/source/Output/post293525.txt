Why the Application folder consume almost 20 times more space than the binaries? <body> It is the storage usage as reported by System Information  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uYKZ3.png" alt="enter image description here"  If I run codedu -d 1/code in code/Applications/code, the total space used is actually just 18G.  I have already installed and scanned the HD with strongClean My Mac 3/strong many times but it did not report any space it can reclaim from apps.   My questions:  1) Why the large discrepancy in space used?  2) How can I reclaim some spaces?
