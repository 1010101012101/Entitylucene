Pages, Numbers, Notes etc will not open after restoring Guest profile from tarball <body> We have around 100 iMacs that all use the Guest profile. To save some time during setup, we download and unpack a pre-configured /System/Library/User Template folder. This worked great until we updated to El Capitan. Now, whenever we open Pages, Numbers, Keynote or Notes we get the error below. It only happens under the guest account.  This can be duplicated by tarballing the /System/Library/User Template folder, deleting the folder and restoring it from the tarball.   I've tried repairing permissions and chmod 777 on the folders (as a test)  ul liSIP is disabled/li liI'm running the tar commands with the p switch and as administrator/li liWhen the Guest user logs in, the /Users/Guest folder is created using the files at /System/Library/User Template/li liWhen Notes (for example) is started as Guest, it tries to create a bunch of symlinks in /Users/Guest/Library/Containers/com.apple.notes/Data/Library. It also creates the /Users/Guest/Library/Containers/com.apple.notes/Data/Library/Preferences folder and adds more symlinks there. The folder is created successfully, but the symlinks are not. This is where the applications crash./li liThe source of the symlink in the error is     /Users/Guest/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist /li liPermissions look the same on working and not working Macs./li liThe same thing happens if I rsync -ar the folder, delete it, and restore it/li liI know that this is not recommended or supported, but it is the way it is done here.  /li /ul  Can't Create Symlinks at All?  I started with a fresh install, logged in as guest, created a text file and was able to create a symlink of the file on the desktop. Logged out as Guest and in as administrator, backed up, deleted and restored the User Template folder, logged back in as guest and got "Operation not permitted" with the same command.   The Error:     Sandbox creation failed: container object initialization failed. You   don't have permission to save the file ".GlobalPreferences.plist" in   the  folder "Preferences".       createSymbolicLinkAtPath:withDestinationPath:error: WR/DST:   ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.iWork.Pages/Data/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPref   erences.plist   Duplicating the issue:  precodetar cpvzf UserTemplateBackup.tar.gz “User Template” rm –Rf “User Template” tar xpvzf UserTemplateBackup.tar.gz /code/pre  How can I fix the existing Macs?
