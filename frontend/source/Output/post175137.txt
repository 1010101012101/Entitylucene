Can Dual Link DVI do 4K at 60Hz? <body> I've got a 4K monitor attached via Dual Link DVI. It does 4K, but only at 30Hz.  It does 60 Hz up to 2560x1440; anything above that is 30Hz.  Is that a limitation of DVI?  <answer197618> A single dual-link DVI connection can deliver up to 2560 Ã— 1600 at 60 Hz. Achieving 4K at 60Hz requires emtwo/em dual-link DVI cables, emor/em DisplayPort 1.2 emor/em HDMI 2.0.  So, emyes/em, as you put it, that's a limitation of DVI.  <answer264684> I have a Dell 3007wfp-hc monitor using DVI-D dual link 2560X1600 native and am on a ASRock z68 Extreme4 Gen3 / 32GB RAM/ i7 2600k oc to 4.4GHz. I have 2 X ASUS Strix GTX 980 SLI enabled with DSR selected. most of my games are running  3840X2400 at 60fps minimum and the few that dip below 60 fps don't go below 40.  My gaming platform is not supposed to be able to run 3840X2400. Obviously the reviewers are telling us something about a compelling need to upgrade to achieve a quality 4k gaming experience. What it is may not be the whole story since my experience on a 5 year old platform clearly are not exceptional beyond the fact that I am using factory OC video cards and have a modest OC on my Sandy Bridge. OS is windows 10.
