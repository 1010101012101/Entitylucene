How can I do the equivalent of a Unix find / -print [under user permissions] under Mountain Lion? <body> I am doing, or trying to do, a 'find /' which I would like to recursively list every file the user has permission to access under the volume "Macintosh HD" and nothing else.  I am presently filtering out the output of the find to exclude files under Backups.backupdb. This is a partial solution at best because the system is bogging under attempts to access flaky NSF mounts.  Is there a shell command that I can use that will stay on "Macintosh HD", recursively list file paths, and leave other volumes alone?  <answer65933> If I understand your question, I think you want codefind "/Volumes/Macintosh HD/"/code. Because OS X mounts volumes in code/Volumes/code, every volume is a subdirectory of code//code, hence why you're getting results from volumes you don't want.  <answer65945> find can do this itself as per Apple's man page. You ned the code-x/code option to      Prevent find from descending into directories that have a device number different than that of                the file from which the descent began.   <comment77597> This won't help. `/Volumes/Macintosh HD` is just a symlink to `/`, so `find "/Volumes/Macintosh HD/"` will traverse into /Volumes/Macintosh HD/Volumes/randomothervolumes just like `find /` would.
