How to fix the iPad home screen being dark purple? <body> My iPad Mini's home screen is really dark and I think it's because of something I have done.  I have removed emoji keyboard as I thought that was causing it but the darkness still remains.  <answer205718> strongbrightness/strong  It sounds like you have your brightness turned down.
