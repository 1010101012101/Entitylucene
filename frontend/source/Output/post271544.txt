How do I access my full Photo Stream on PC *once it's installed*? <body> I've got iCloud fully installed and set up. I can see my iCloud Photos directory and the Downloads, Shared and Uploads directories within it. But  "My Photo Stream" only contains 53 pictures - barely a percent of my actual iCloud photo stream.  Fundamentally, I want to download and delete all the files from one album in my iCloud photos. the iCloud web interface is useless for that, as it would involve selecting over 3,000 files individually. The iCloud Photos "Downloads" directory is useless, since it doesn't contain all the pictures - and because it's one-way. Every source I've found says "Use My Photo Stream". But that doesn't seem to work at all.  So where, on my PC, do I find my iCloud photos strongin full/strong? Sortable by album and bulk selectable would be nice.  <comment341335> Downloading thousands of full-res photos from iCloud will take several days.  Have you followed all the steps in [this Apple iCloud Support page](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205323)? <comment341337> Yes, but some time ago. Seems my version of iCloud doesn't have Photo Library, so thanks for the reminder. Updating it now. Download time won't be a problem, it's only 10-15 gigs or so. <comment341338> If that works, I can add that as an answer. <comment341339> Cheers, I'll update when I see if it works.
