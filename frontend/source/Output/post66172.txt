Should I use an extension power cord instead? <body> I have the following Apple MacBook Pro Power adapter:     60W  MagSafe PV85 Ouptput 16.5v--3.65A ADP-60AD T      Model No. A1344   Instead of buying a Power Adapter, is it ok to buy an Extension power cord (Found this on eBay)?   Will I be still be able to charge my MacBook with this?  <answer66173> If you just change the head of the adapter there's no reason you couldn't charge your MBP.    <answer66174> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MAp0q.jpg" alt="Power adapter and cable"  The extension cord is the part on the right. One came with your power adapter, and it goes between the adapter and the wall. A new one would work fine with your current power adapter but won't do anything by itself.  <comment77831> How can i change it ? It is fixed right. Sorry i am new to this <comment77833> No the head is a removable part of the adapter and you can replace it with the power cord. <comment77834> I don't think i got a extension cord free with my macbook. So what you say is that there is no point in buying an extension cord, because i will not be able to charge my MacBook <comment77835> Could you show me an image of the head (which you are talking about ?). the problem i have is that the 5 pin part has got corroded. Can i replace this ? Help <comment77836> http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41WmEIwOtgL._SL500_AA300_.jpg Here the head is removed. <comment77838> The MagSafe end (the 5-pin part) is firmly attached to the power adapter and not replaceable. <comment77839> So guys.. is it replaceable or not replaceable :S <comment77840> It sounds like the problem is that the MagSafe connector at the top-left of that photo is damaged. No, the extension won't help. <comment77841> Can i replace the MagSafe connector (5 Pin part) with another  ? Is there any other cheap replacement device (when compared with the Power Adapter) i could use to charge my Machine ? <comment77842> No, sorry. You'll need a new power adapter. <comment77843> Thanks, In my power adapter it says A1344 as its part number, but can i use any of the following part numbers `A1172, A1181, A1184, MA538LL/A, 661-0443, 661-4269, 661-4485, 661-4259, 661-4339` <comment77850> There are only a few Apple adapters, so it's not hard to find the right one. If you have a 13" MacBook or MacBook Pro, you need a 60W adapter. Airs take a 45W adapter and 15/17" models take an 85W adapter. There are also variations of the 45 and 85 with MagSafe 2 connections, which are only for some of the latest models. You can also use an adapter with a different wattage, but you'll get poor performance if its wattage is lower than what the laptop requires.
