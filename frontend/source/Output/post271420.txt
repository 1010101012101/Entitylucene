Word file compatibility between mac and pc <body> I'm thinking of buying a mac but I am a bit worried about how mac will handle word files from a windows machine. I have a number of word files in both .doc and .docx format.  Does anyone know if there might be any problems opening these kind of files and, equally important, preserve the formatting and styles on a mac?  I will be using Microsoft word on the mac.  <answer271447> In general the "common stuff" goes back and forth between platforms with no problems. Differing sets of fonts, various levels of support for showing colors, etc., between platforms can cause documents to appear differently on Windows vs macOS.  Word has a compatibility checker than can help report on portions of documents that may not translate well to other versions of Word: https://support.office.com/en-US/article/Check-a-document-for-compatibility-C5AA52E0-15C8-4DA7-9942-379552795D90  Here's a document from Microsoft's support knowledge base that covers the topic of sharing MS Office documents amongst various versions of Office: https://support.office.com/en-US/article/Sharing-documents-with-other-versions-of-Office-fdc95a18-f1fe-4049-b85c-42e2143f9243  This article is focused on Powerpoint, but offers good tips about compatibility that apply to Word as well: https://support.office.com/en-US/article/Cross-Platform-PowerPoint-Compatibility-0eebb4f1-c329-4c50-b83c-3af1bab640de  <answer271462>    Does anyone know if there might be any problems opening these kind of files?   You won't have any problems. With the pre-installed Pages app on Mac, you can easily open any code.docx/code and code.doc/code files. They will be converted to code.pages/code documents that can't be opened on Windows PCs, but you can easily export any documents from Pages as code.docx/code files that can be opened on PCs.  An easier solution is to use the web-based Google Drive (n√©e Google Docs) that will let you natively open code.docx/code, sync them to your Google account on all your computers, and edit them from anywhere, including your Mac. Or, if you'd prefer the Microsoft-based approach, you can download the Office suite onto your Mac, which works just how it does on PCs.     Can I preserve the formatting and styles on a mac?   I've had no problems preserving format and styling of a code.docx/code document on Mac, using Pages or Google Drive. You will have no problems with a modern program like the ones I've suggested above.  hr  strongtl;dr:/strong You can totally use Pages, Google Drive, or Word on your Mac to open, edit, and export documents without losing any formatting.  <answer271587> Since you indicated that you will be using Word for Mac, as long as it's the 2016 or 2011 versions you will have no problems.  Microsoft has merged the code base (finally) so the versions for Mac and Windows are now identical, and the docs they produce are fully interoperable.  <comment341178> Not detailed enough to be considered an answer... but let's just say compatibility between the two is *'approximate'*. It works, but you wouldn't bet the farm on the two displaying identically. <comment341186> If in certain cases you need totally perfect duplication, you can always run Windows on a Mac and use Windows Word. <comment341190> The new MS Office for Mac is pretty good. For regular documents you will not notice any difference. More sophisticated functions like VBA may differ in some aspects and not work as well. <comment341228> Got you an answer, let me know if it's what you're looking for or not! <comment341259> Sounds good! Thank you for your help! <comment341390> I would never recommend someone use Pages as a substitute for Word for serious academic or business work, it has too many potential limitations and compatibilty issues.  LibraOffice would be better. <comment341397> For info on areas where they are not identical, see   http://blog.parallels.com/2016/01/21/differences-microsoft-office-mac/
