Does iOS 4.2 change the voltage on the camera kit USB? <body> I want to use my happy hacking keyboard with ipad.  I just read an aritlce about changes on ios 4.2.

Is that true?  <answer4762> Yes it is true, I just connected my USB Key Board using Camera connection adapter, and it shows "Accessory unavailable, The attached accessory uses too much power".  iPad Software Version: 4.2  <answer4774> I could have sworn I've managed to use a USB keyboard with my iPad, and it shipped to me with 4.2.1 installed.
