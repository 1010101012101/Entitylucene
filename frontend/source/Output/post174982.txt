In which .plist is the underscan setting stored? <body> I'm trying to write a script which changes the underscan value on my Mac mini, but I haven't found the .plist file containing the setting.  Does anyone know where the underscan setting is saved?  <answer174986> I don't know - but I do use the free EasyFind (by DevonTech) that will search emeverything/em on your machine, every aspect of search.   <answer175021> I found the settings file by using the terminal command codeopensnoop/code to monitor all files accessed by any programm and found that the file that stores the underscan setting is here:  code/var/db/.com.apple.iokit.graphics/code  <comment206232> Thanks, but without knowing what to look for, this programm is useless.
