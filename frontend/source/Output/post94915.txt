I purchased & downloaded Mountain Lion, and then...nothing happened <body> I purchased Mountain Lion through the App Store on my 10.7.5 MacBook Pro.  The download completed and I clicked through the prompts to choose an install location and agree to the terms.  I'm sorry to say I'm not sure what happened next as I shifted my attention to another computer.  I assumed the install process was running.  However, when I looked back at my MBP, I was back on the desktop with no sign of activity.  (It's conceivable that I clicked "cancel" by mistake -- I'm kind of tired/distracted/trying to juggle several things at once today.)  I went back to the App Store, looked under "purchases," and found Mountain Lion labelled as "downloaded" (as I would expect).  How can I restart the installation?  Can I go to the downloaded file and click on it? Where would I find it?  <answer94916> Check your /Applications folder. After downloading Mountain Lion, the installer is placed there (entitled Install OS X Mountain Lion).  It will be deleted after installation, but should still be present on your machine if you have not upgraded yet.  <answer94922> Look for strongInstall OS X Mountain Lion/strong in the Launchpad or Spotlight. It looks like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TwQMg.png" alt="Install OS X Mountain Lion"  <comment111303> As an aside, since you have multiple computers, it may be worth pointing out that before running the Install OS X Mountain Lion app, you can copy it to a separate drive or USB memory stick, etc.  This way, you can install it on all your computers without having to wait for it to download on each of them separately.
