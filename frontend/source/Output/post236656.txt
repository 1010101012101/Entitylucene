Mysterious audible buzzing at 4:33am <body> Consistently at 4:33 AM, my laptop emits an audible buzzing sound. What could be the cause of this? I have had all app programs closed and this buzzing sound still occurs.   <comment289668> Set the time to 4:30am, open QuickTime and record the screen and audio and upload it <comment289948> Stay up until 4:33 am or set an alarm for 4:30. Also it could be an alarm app like sClock.
