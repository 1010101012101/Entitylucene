AppStore formatting is broken <body> My Macbook, Version 10.9.5 Build 13F1077, AppStore is somehow broken. It's like the formatting of it is broken. See attached image. Any idea's about what happened or how to troubleshoot or fix?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mY4MK.png" alt="AppStoreScreenShot"  As a follow up to inquiries from @d-w @thomas-jones, yes, I am seeing bad formatting on some other Apple web pages. For example:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uAxeI.png" alt="Support.Apple.comIssue"  <answer182463> Try opening Terminal and entering the following command to enable the App Store Debug menu:     defaults write com.apple.appstore ShowDebugMenu -bool YES   Then, quit the App Store (if it was already open), and relaunch it. You should see a new menu after the Help menu labeled Debug. Open it and select Reset Application.   If that doesn't solve your problem, you might need to flush the DNS cache, the commands are listed below.  Yosemite: codesudo discoveryutil mdnsflushcache/code br Lion, Mountain Lion and Mavericks: codesudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder/code br Snow Leopard: codesudo dscacheutil -flushcache/code  i(to remove the debug menu from the App Store, enter the same command above used to enable it, and change the end from YES to NO.)/i  <answer186343> Try resetting your computer's Date and Time, the settings are located in Apple Menu  System Preferences  Data &amp; Time. If the "Set date and time automatically:" checkbox is enabled, disable it, and manually set the time and date correctly.   Try loading the App Store again.  <answer186433> I finally figured it out. In Keychain Access, I selected Preferences, then Reset my Default Keychain. After doing that, I restarted AppStore and it was working normally.   <answer243374> In case anyone's stylesheet is being blocked by a proxy, Apple seems to host the Mac App Store stylesheet at "s.mzstatic.com". I used the debug menu to download the page source and find out where the stylesheets were being hosted.  So, if you're facing network issues, ask your network admin to unblock code*s.mzstatic.com*/code and you should be good to go.  <comment217228> Is your Internet connection through a filtering proxy? <comment217230> Thanks for your reply David. No, just a cable modem and wifi router, no proxy or special configuration. <comment217358> Thomas, thanks for your suggestions. I tried both but neither seems to have an effect. I have Mavericks so I did the sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder. And I ran that as root in case that matters. <comment217458> If this were a web page, I'd say that the CSS stylesheet didn't load.  Sometimes this happens to me if I have a flaky Internet connection or a flaky DNS server.  Can you reboot and try on another network?  (Do you by any chance know how to use Wireshark or another network packet sniffer?  If you do, you could look at it to try to troubleshoot failed network connections.) <comment217626> Do you ever experience similar problems when browsing websites? <comment217657> No, I use a mix of Safari, Firefox and Chrome and have not noticed any other issues. <comment217895> I agree it looks like the CSS style sheet is missing. I guess the app store is a single purpose web browser. I'll try to investigate network issues but I use the network all day so I'm doubtful that is the issue. <comment218388> Actually @thomas-jones I do see some issues browsing apple websites. I edited my original comment, above, with a screenshot. <comment219946> Notice how the SSL certificate verification has failed on the Chome screenshot? That's caused many a problem for me, most often the cause is incorrect Date and Time settings. <comment220080> Thomas, that had no effect. I even rebooted after but it didn't seem to make a difference. <comment220280> Such a strange problem, well, I'm glad you sorted it out :).
