Opedirectoryd taking >90% of CPU + thousands of messages in console per second <body> Some time ago our company laptops started to overheat. At first it was nothing serious but after a while almost all our macbooks started to act more like ovens than computers. The issue seems to lie in Active directory we use for both our PCs and MACs.  Logs are getting about 4000 messages per second. Every time its the same thing.  precodeopendirectoryd: assertion failed: 14E46: AppleLdap + 24580 {4B807ACD-E59B-3635-99BA-B08122AA513C}: 0X0 /code/pre  Even if I disable messaging for the process the opendirectoryd still takes more than 90% of CPU. If I at least knew what the error message means than maybe I could do something about it.  The issue is even worse on El Capitan in fact it is so bad that machines with it won't even boot properly.  If anyone knows how to fix this or at least knows what the message means I would be most grateful.  <answer213882>    h1OS X: If the opendirectoryd process CPU utilization is high after updating to OS X v10.9.5/h1      h3You might see an increase in CPU utilization of the opendirectoryd process on systems bound to Active Directory that are updated to OS X v10.9.5./h3      After updating to OS X v10.9.5, Activity Monitor might report high CPU   utilization for the process "opendirectoryd" on Macs that are bound to   Active Directory. You can edit the Active Directory search path to   correct this issue:      ol   liChoose System Preferences from the Apple menu. Click the Users &amp;/li   liGroups icon in the System Preferences window. If the lock icon is   locked, click it and enter the name and password of an/li   liadministrator./li   liClick Login Options, then click Edit./li   liClick Open/li   liDirectory Utility. If the lock icon is locked, click it and enter   the name and password of an administrator./li   liClick Search Policy./li   liClick Authentication./li   liRemove "/Active Directory/EXAMPLE.COM” from   the search path, leaving "/Active Directory/EXAMPLE.COM/All Domains”   (substitute your domain for example.com)./li   liQuit Directory Utility./li   /ol   I shamelessly copied the above from support.apple.com. I hope this can help you out, but for now I have no clue on your system setup.  <comment258147> Does disconnecting the internet help to prevent it? What version of OS X do you run? Have there recently been changes to the way you setup your servers? <comment258148> btw, welcome ;) <comment258150> We had the path set up this way already so this is not it. But thanks. <comment258151> Yes being disconnected from internet helps. <comment258152> Might be you can give us more details on your setup. Because when disconnecting from the internets works than you probably have your settings wrong. <comment258153> God I wish I could give you more, but turns out nobody knows how it was set up around here. Not to mention that our "network experts" refuse to acknowledge that their network might be at fault and management doesn't put any pressure on them because they use Windows. Edit: btw I understand that I'm giving too little info, but right know this is all I have and will be in foreseeable future.
