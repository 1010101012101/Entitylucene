Macbook Air Virus/Shenanigans? <body> I'm on my Macbook Air past midnight, about 15 minutes prior to post. I'm watching South Park on kisscartoon.com (using Google Chrome equipped with Betternet VPN and AdBlock). About halfway through the episode, I'm startled by a louder-than-average burst of a random rock song. (There was a song going on in-show at the time. Pretty meta. Pausing in the middle of the episode left the out-of-place audio still going, though, so that isn't really related.) The burst morphs into a softer rock song, then a techno-y type of song, then a few weird sounds that sounded like those stock ones you find in iMovie or something. It stops. I say "brrr," and finish the episode, then head here. I can nearly confirm that it wasn't a popup, as there were no externally open tabs or windows during the happening or afterwards. The reason I'm giving so much info is because I have absolutely no idea what it was. In short, what the hell? 0_0  <comment318963> And you're sure it was coming from the computer, and not a car that was driving by, or a neighbor or something? <comment318965> @tubedogg Oh yeah, this absolutely was my computer. No question. I heard it  r i g h t  next to me. It scared the shit out of me, let me tell you. I'm still jumpy.
