Applescript to Heart or Love or Favorite song <body> Anyone know if there's away to heart/love/favorite a song in the new iTunes via applescript?  Basically I want the ability to heart a song from Apple Music without switching back to iTunes.  <answer197435> At the moment it doesn't appear to be possible to get or set properties on music played through Apple Music.  However you can heart a track that is stored locally or played from your iCloud Music Library.  precodetell application "iTunes"     set loved of current track to true end tell /code/pre  <answer227981> I wrote a pretty hacky script that does the job for Apple Music tracks. It right clicks on the app icon in the dock, and selects the first option in the menu.  precodeset current_app to current application activate application "Dock" tell application "System Events"     tell process "Dock"         set frontmost to true         activate         tell list 1             perform action "AXShowMenu" of UI element "iTunes"             delay 0.01             repeat 1 times -- move down one menu item to the 'love' option                 key code 125 -- down arrow             end repeat             delay 0.1 -- 0.01 was too fast             repeat 2 times                 key code 36 -- return key             end repeat         end tell     end tell end tell activate current_app /code/pre  (Based on this answer)  Again, this is super-hacky, but it works for me when I'm listening via "For You", which is the only time I usually "love" tracks.  <comment236031> Yeah thats my problem it works for songs downloaded to your music library.   Apparently a radar has been field http://www.openradar.me/21674162 <comment236032> Yup. You can see Doug Adams of "Doug's AppleScripts for iTunes" talking about it here too. http://dougscripts.com/itunes/2015/07/itunes-12-2-and-applescript-issues-volume-2/ Hopefully this is something that will appear in a minor update soon.
