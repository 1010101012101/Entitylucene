Import finalcut project into imovie <body> My finalcut pro trial expired before I could export the movie I was working on. How can I import it into imovie?  <answer296030> Unfortunately, there is no way to import Final Cut projects into iMovie.  Attempting to open the Final Cut project file into iMovie will fail because it uses a different file format. There is also no way to convert this into a format iMovie will read because Final Cut has many more features and options that will not translate to iMovie.  If you still can, your best bet would be to export whatever you have in Final Cut as single video file and import that into iMovie. You will no longer have the ability to edit the composition of that clip or any effects that have been applied it to it, but it's your best bet unless you don't mind starting from scratch.  <comment373889> final cut pro wont start up again <comment373890> Unfortunately there is nothing you can do. There is absolutely no compatibility/correlation between Final Cut and iMovie. They are two entirely separate and independent pieces of software <comment373952> looks like ill need another 30 day trial
