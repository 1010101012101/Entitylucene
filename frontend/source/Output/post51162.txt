How to change the default language of Facebook share page on iPad? <body> Whenever I want to share something on Facebook using another app on iPad, the Facebook login page show in Chineese.br I can change this by choosing English at the bottom of this login page but after I login the following pages would be still in Chineese.   How can I change the default language?  <answer51166> Did you try to set your default language on Facebook on English (in account parameters) ? What is the language you use on the iPad and on Facebook right now ?  strongEDIT :/strong after some tests it's seems that is more Facebook API related (because the problem is on several apps at a time). Either developers don't call correctly the Facebook login, or it's a bug.   <comment58512> Both my iPad's and Facebook account's language are set to English. <comment58513> From which app(s) did you try to share content ? The problem is on every app or just on or two for example ? <comment58514> I tried on Ted, Pulse and Flipboard. <comment58515> Just try with TediSub and I have the Facebook dialog in Bahasa Indonesia. But I don't have any problem on Flipboard. Seems to me that the problem is on the app. Are you up to date with Flipboard ? <comment58523> Every app is up to date. Tedisub is not a free app and I don't think I'll give it a try. <comment58524> Just tried with the TED app : same problem than TEDiSub. Maybe it concern the Facebook API used in apps to connect with Facebook profile. I don't have another idea for the moment sorry.
