Customize touch bar on lock screen? <body> On the 2016 MacBook Pro with touch bar, most Apple applications allow you to customize the touch bar. It's also possible to change the control strip in the System Preferences.  However, I can't find a way to change the touch screen buttons that are displayed on the lock screen. I would like to add the backward/forward media buttons besides the play button.  Does anybody know how (or: whether) this is possible?  <answer277892> There is no way to customize it yet. Seems to be ample space to place them around the "Play" icon.  <comment348481> Same question, did you find something? <comment348578> @GonzaloSolera Not yet unfortunately, I'm afraid it is not possible.
