Convert Bootable DVD to DMG <body> i want to convert my codeSierra/code DVD to a codeDMG/code file , so i could install it on non-mac device ( PC ).  I used codeDisk Utilities/code but not worked...  Is it possible to do this ? or i strongHave/strong to download the source from AppStore ?  <answer291098> https://kb.wisc.edu/page.php?id=7058  You need to make a disk image as explained in the provided link, however there is far more involved in making a Hackintosh, and it comes down to having the right hardware and understanding how to apply information about how to do it correctly.  Check compatibility: http://www.hackintosh.com/#hackintosh_compatible You'll need to follow this guide: http://www.hackintosh.com/  I'd recommend watching some YouTube videos and while I haven't tried to make a Hackintosh in a few years, I'd high suggest that you should not expect it to work perfectly and it does require a decent amount of work to make it work  <comment367541> There is no such thing as a Sierra DVD installation disk.
