L2TP/VPN data corruption issue on macOS 10.12 <body> I am experiencing a strange data corruption issue while working on a L2TP VPN, after upgrading from macOS 10.11 to 10.12.  Random corrupted data occurs in the middle of somewhat "larger" downloaded files, e. g. JavaScript resources or any other source files with a file size around 1 ~ 2 MB. It seems the corruption comes up occasionally at file sizes &lt; 1 MB, but quite reliable at file sizes above. The position and content appears to be random. I am attaching a screenshot containing an example of the file corruption which occured in a 1.4 MB JavaScript file.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DUd5k.png" alt="enter image description here"  I never had any problems concerning this on macOS 10.10 or 10.11 and the latest issue results in very annoying consequences. E. g. I am not able to access JS-heavy web apps anymore. Furthermore it is risky to work in live systems of enterprise software when downloading, patching and uploading files. People around me using the same VPN on macOS 10.12 have the very same problem, whereas people still working on macOS 10.11 have no trouble at all.  Does anyone else experience this problem? How can I troubleshoot this?

I had the same issue, and it turns out if I moved the ethernet from the port on the OWC replicator, to a USB-C Ethernet, the problem went away.  <comment326004> That is an insidious failure. Are you thinking that a web browser (safari or other) is actually not receiving the correct files or are you using `rsync` or webdav or another way to download these files to the filesystem? Basically - what transport method is failing you over VPN? <comment326013> Good hint! Any transport method. I did a lot of testing and noticed it both while downloading files via web browsers and `curl`/`wget` (WebDAV/HTTP), as well as via `scp`/`rsync` (SSH). What's interesting: `scp` (SSH) downloads are interrupted by an error (`ETACorrupted MAC on input. / ssh_dispatch_run_fatal: Connection to 192.168.227.227 port 22: message authentication code incorrect / lost connection`), whereas `curl` (HTTP) downloads finish, but contain the above-mentioned corrupted characters.
