PHP loop through files in directory <body> I´m new at PHP and finding it difficult to understand the manual.  I need to run this code : code$snapchat-&gt;setStory($imagePath)/code for every file present in a certain directory. After code has run the file needs to be deleted from the directory. File names are all different.  Can anybody help me creating this process.

But it looks like PHP has a class for this: RecursiveDirectoryIterator  and also scandir:  precode(PHP 5) scandir — List files and directories inside the specified path  array scandir ( string $directory [, int $sorting_order = SCANDIR_SORT_ASCENDING [, resource $context ]] ) Returns an array of files and directories from the directory. /code/pre  <answer198063> Agree that this is better suited for stackoverflow.  In the meantime, you might want to check the  PHP documentation for the codeglob/code command, which gives you an array of all the files in the named directory.   <comment236917> [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) is probably a better place to ask programming level questions of this nature. <comment236939> thanks, I will then post in stack. Cause I´m finding it difficult to understand the php manual.
