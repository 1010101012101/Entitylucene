Batch replace substring with another in filenames <body> I have a bunch of files named similar to this:  precode1_1.pngEND1_1.png /code/pre  How would you replace code.pngEND/code with code_/code?  I've googled this problem and tried  literally 5+ solutions, non of which worked on mac.  <answer280484> There are tons of ways to do this, for instance  precodefor i in *pngEND*.png; do [[ -e ${i/.pngEND/_} ]] || echo mv "$i" "${i/.pngEND/_}"; done /code/pre  Remove the codeecho/code if the output looks sensible.   <answer280495> Unless you need a solution you can use in a script, you can do this directly in Finder.  ul liSelect the files you want to rename/li liRight click one of them, and choose strongRename N Items.../strong (where N is the number of selected files)/li liChoose the strongReplace Text/strong option in the dropdown/li liEnter the text you want to replace (".pngEND") and the text you want to replace it with ("_")/li liClick strongRename/strong/li /ul  <answer280500> If your not familier with terminal or scripts, you can use the mac app called emNameChanger/em (free to use). You can change almost everything in batch on filenames / file extentions.  <answer280554> If I had to do this, I'd use rename command available for install via HomeBrew.  Example:  Setup:  codemac:test user$ touch 1_1.pngEND1_1.png/code  precodemac:test user$ ls 1_1.pngEND1_1.png /code/pre  Run rename command:  codemac:test user$ rename 's/\.pngEND/_/' *.pngEND*/code  Result:  precodemac:test user$ ls 1_1_1_1.png /code/pre  <answer280559> I've also used the perl coderename/code tool to some success.  It also has a dry run option so you can test before you execute the changes.  <comment352822> If you edit your post to detail one solution you sel cited to try and the link you used, we might be able to correct what doesn't work for you. (Or point to a better tool to batch rename files). I'd use bash or Python depending on how easy a restore from backup was, but [those tools or just using `mv` could backfire](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/280451/erased-usr-local-bin-directory-by-mistake) if you're not already good with the syntax needed.. <comment352838> For this specific type of batch rename, though, there's no need for 3rd party apps--Finder can do it. <comment352841> cool. didnt know about this <comment352847> I suggest that you look at the venerable `perl rename`- http://search.cpan.org/~pederst/rename-1.9/bin/rename.PL <comment352906> Do I need to install anything to use perl commands? <comment352908> That just the history.  It's just a tool contained in the package manager that can be used on Linux/GNU-based environments.  It may be in it's own like `perl-rename`.
