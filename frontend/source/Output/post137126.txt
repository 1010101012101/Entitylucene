How to bless a partition using a custom EFI-boot file with non-conforming directory structures and/or file names? <body> Is there a guide on how to bless a partition for booting, one that doesn't have the default code/System/Library/CoreServices/boot.efi/code structure?  For example, I installed GRUB on the default EFI System Partition (/dev/disk0s1in OS X, /dev/sda1 in Linux) and I have the file code/EFI/arch_grub/grubx64.efi/code that I want to use instead of code/System/Library/CoreServices/boot.efi/code.  Normally, following the standard structure, I would copy grubx64.efi to code/System/Library/CoreServices/boot.efi/code and also touch code/mach_kernel/code in the partition I want to make bootable, then I'd run the following to bless the partition:  precode# bless --folder=&lt;Path to root of extra partition&gt; --file=&lt;Path to root of extra partition&gt;/System/Library/CoreServices/boot.efi --setBoot # bless --mount=&lt;Path to root of extra partition&gt; --file=&lt;Path to root of extra partition&gt;/System/Library/CoreServices/boot.efi --setBoot /code/pre  To install GRUB, I followed the instructions in the Arch Linux Beginners' guide, which leaves me with (something like) code/EFI/arch_grub/grubx64.efi/code file, where word codearch_grub/code is arbitrarily chosen. Then running the following commands succeeds with no errors:  precode# bless --folder=&lt;Path to root of GRUB ESP partition&gt; --file=&lt;Path to root of GRUB ESP partition&gt;/EFI/arch_grub/grubx64.efi --setBoot # bless --mount=&lt;Path to root of GRUB ESP partition&gt; --file=&lt;Path to root of GRUB ESP partition&gt;/EFI/arch_grub/grubx64.efi --setBoot /code/pre  But the partition doesn't show up in the Apple boot menu, and codesudo bless --verbose --info &lt;Path to root of GRUB ESP partition&gt;/code shows:  precode┌─[02:31:54/trusktrs-MacBook-Pro/trusktr//tmp] └─╼ sudo bless --verbose --info /tmp/boot/ Mount point for /tmp/boot/ is /private/tmp/boot GPT detected Booter partition required at index 2 System partition found Preferred system partition found: disk0s1 Returning booter information dictionary: &lt;CFBasicHash 0x7fedd340a740 [0x7fff7622ff00]&gt;{type = mutable dict, count = 3, entries =&gt;     0 : &lt;CFString 0x1097b4e70 [0x7fff7622ff00]&gt;{contents = "System Partitions"} = (     disk0s1 )     1 : &lt;CFString 0x1097b5650 [0x7fff7622ff00]&gt;{contents = "Data Partitions"} = (     disk0s1 )     2 : &lt;CFString 0x1097b5670 [0x7fff7622ff00]&gt;{contents = "Auxiliary Partitions"} = ( ) } /code/pre  I made sure to codetouch &lt;Path to root of GRUB ESP partition&gt;/mach_kernel/code then unblessed and re-blessed the partition using the same commands but no luck.  I bet I'm missing something(s) simple and that it's not difficult to do what I want, but I'm not exactly sure what I need to do.  Any tips/ideas/suggestions?
