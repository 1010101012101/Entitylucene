Is it possible to activate whichever mail client is connected by default to a mailto link in applescript? <body> So I have an apple script that sends an email via the mail app. I didn't make it myself though.  precodetell application "Mail"     set newMessage to make new outgoing message with properties {subject:mailSubject, visible:true}     tell newMessage         set content to mailContent         set visible to true     end tell     activate end tell /code/pre  Now I would like to change the script to, instead of opening the codeMail/code app directly, just open a codemailto:/code link with whatever client is configured for that.  Is that possible?  <answer235697> Whatever opens MAILTO:// links is set from within the Mail.app itself Go to Mail  Preferences  General and the top pop-up menu lets you set any installed application that the OS recognizes as being able to respond to those links as the default email application.  There used to be hacks that let a web browser with a webmail client open respond to mailto links but I haven't used one of them in years so not sure if/how that would work.  <comment288285> This sounds like an _XY Problem_, so let me suggest that you use **[Default Apps](http://www.rubicode.com/Software/RCDefaultApp/)** and on the **URL's** tab, scroll down to **mailto** and set the **Default Application:** to whichever **Mail Client** you want `mailto:` links to open in. Then there should be no need for an AppleScript, unless you're not presenting the whole story in your question.
