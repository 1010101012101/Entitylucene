Installing wine with osxwinebuilder <body> I try to install wine with osxwinebuilder. When I do, I get the following error:  precode... checking if ccache g++ supports -c -o file.o... yes checking if ccache g++ supports -c -o file.o... (cached) yes checking whether the ccache g++ linker (/usr/bin/ld) supports shared libraries... yes checking dynamic linker characteristics... darwin12.2.0 dyld checking how to hardcode library paths into programs... immediate checking ltdl.h usability... no checking ltdl.h presence... no checking for ltdl.h... no checking that we can compile and link with libltdl... no configure: error: cannot compile and link against libltdl libgphoto2 requires libltdl (the libtool dl* library), but cannot compile and link against it. Aborting.  could not run configure command './configure --prefix=/Users/scott/wine/wine-1.5.16 --enable-shared=yes --enable-static=no --with-libexif=auto' in /Users/scott/wine/build/libgphoto2-2.4.14 - exiting /code/pre  I am confused as what I should do. I have homebrew installed - should I install anything?  <answer70128> I will hazard the guess that you need to install libtool.  You can do that with  precodebrew install libtool brew link libtool /code/pre  From what I understand, libltdl is provided with that. http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual/html_node/Using-libltdl.html  I don't actually use homebrew so I hope that my stab in the dark helps you find your solution!
