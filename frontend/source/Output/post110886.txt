How to prevent AppleScript confirmation from appearing when using Quicksilver trigger? <body> When I launch this simple AppleScript from Finder or by using the standard Quicksilver panel selection, it runs without confirmation.  precodetell application "Flux"     if it is running then         quit application "Flux"     else         launch application "Flux"     end if end tell /code/pre  But if I launch it with a Quicksilver trigger, it opens a confirmation dialog asking "Are you sure you want to run this script?"  How do I prevent this confirmation dialog from appearing?  <comment130560> I can’t get the dialogue to appear at all. I tried:    * Saving as a script and using Quicksilver’s “Run” action   * Saving as an application and using the “Open” action   * Entering the script as text in the first pane and using the “Run as AppleScript” action  In all cases, the thing just runs silently. I used TextMate, since I don’t have Flux, but that seems unlikely to matter. <comment130847> @RobMcBroom Using OSX 10.9? <comment130958> Yes, I’m using 10.9.
