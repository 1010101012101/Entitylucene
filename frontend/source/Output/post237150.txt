Reverse SSH tunnel daemon <body> I own a Macintosh laptop (10.11.2) that I would like to create a permanent reverse SSH tunnel.   This way, when I switch network, or the computer is stolen, I can remotely SSH into the device independent on what network it is on.   Currently, I run this command from when I am on the laptop, but if my network gets interrupted, I have to run it again.  precodessh -N -R 2000:localhost:22 root@my_server_ip /code/pre  (and then run codessh -p 2000 localhost/code on my home server)  But if my laptop switches network, or I am not physically on it to run the command, the reverse SSH tunnel does not work.  Is there any mac command line solution for this?  <answer237218> There is codeautossh/code doing exactly what you need:  precodeautossh -M 12345 -N -R 2000:localhost:22 root@my_server_ip /code/pre  But you should certainly reconsider running the tunnel using coderoot/code account, when it is password-less (unless you have the key limited using codeauthorized_commands/code).
