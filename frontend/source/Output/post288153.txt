13" MacBook Pro Retina has distorted audio from right speaker <body> My MacBook Pro, after years of use with no problems, has started giving me distorted audio from the bottom-most part of my right speaker. I've looked for previous questions, and there is no fix listed.   strongMy question is:/strong Is there an easy fix for this that does not involve going to the Store and getting my laptop taken apart?  <comment363867> This answer will help determine if it's hardware or software. If it's hardware, then it's a trip to the Apple Store - https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/191511/85275
