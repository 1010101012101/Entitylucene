macbook pro encounters prohibited sign while booting with USB <body> My macbookpro is completely empty and the only option that I have is just internet recovery. I downloaded el capitan and with help of the terminal in the internet recovery build a bootable OSX el capitan. So when I hit kbdc/kbd in startup, apple logo appears. Meanwhile progress bar goes half way and strongsuddenly apple logo changes to prohibited sign/strong. I also made a mavericks bootable usb. same results.  <answer232839> In verbose mode, you will find that OSX gets stuck at:     Still waiting for root device   This error usually happens when your media used to boot OSX is not detected properly and can't be mounted.

It might be  "Still waiting for root device" <comment284150> @RACING121  Yes That is exactly "still waiting for root device". So what should I do <comment284152> Try moving the USB to another port. If no success try creating the bootable media again. This usually happens when OSX doesn't detect your USB fully. Able to boot from but cant properly mount <comment284156> @RACING121 Thank you. I'll try that. should I by another usb device? <comment284157> if all fails you can try another usb <comment284326> @RACING121 I bought an 8 gig Sony USB memory. It worked with my new USB device. :)))
