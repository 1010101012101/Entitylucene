How upload my ipad <body> i made a mistake,i erase all my account, music, books, when i was to restart. I want to know if is possible  upload a backup without connect to apple store. My ipad has ios version 5.1.1.  <comment221955> Just use iTunes and restore your backup of your device.  Why are you using such an old version of iOS anyways? <comment221956> The restore will force you to be on the latest iOS your device supports. It will not authorise unless you connect to Apple. <comment221977> @Ramhound I'd imagine it's a 1st gen iPad. The highest they can go is 5.1.1.
