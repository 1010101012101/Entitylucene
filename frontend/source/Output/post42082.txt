Lion/other browsers than Safari: Are there QuickLook-plug-ins? <body> We all like Safari don't we? :-)  But in case anyone would prefer to use Firefox/Opera/other browsers, is there a way to view files with QuickLook, perhaps via a plugin, or some other method?  Any ideas or links for these? Are they difficult to develop?  <answer42106> To develop Quick Look plugins, you can visit this site, which states:     strongAbout QLPlugins.com/strong      QLPlugins.com is a repository for Quick Look Plugins, which are   available starting with Mac OS X 10.5. In addition, I seek to provide   information for developers seeking to create QuickLook Plugins and to   power users looking to use QuickLook more effectively. If you have   developed a QuickLook Plugin and would like for it to appear on this   website or are aware of any QuickLook Plugins I have missed, send an   e-mail to feedback@qlplugins.com and I will include it.      strongAbout QuickLook &amp; QuickLook Plugins/strong      QuickLook was introduced by Apple in starting with OS X 10.5   (Leopard). By selecting a file in the Finder and pressing the   space-bar, a preview of the file pops up. QuickLook Plugins, or   QuickLook Generators, are files ending in .qlgenerator and are used to   generate these previews. These plugins are also responsible for   generating the previews in CoverFlow mode in the Finder.      While many file formats are supported out of the box, some common and   many obscure formats are not. Fortunately, Apple's programmers made it   easy for developers to create their own custom QuickLook Plugins. This   site seeks to serve as a repository linking to these Plugins and as a   resource for developers looking for information on developing their   own QuickLook Plugins.   The Quick Look developer page was also linked in this Apple discussion forum post.  <comment47810> What do you mean by *their files*? <comment47813> Are you talking about HTML files on your filesystem?
