Is there a way to know which rule filtered an email? <body> My Mail.app has at least 100 rules with thousands of conditions and sometimes I get mail filtered that was not supposed to be filtered.  All my filters work by moving unwanted stuff to the trash.  Is there a way to discover what rule in particular put the email there?  thanks  <comment138051> Wow, that's a whole bunch of rules; can the behavior be duplicated easily â€” does it happen often? <comment138052> Yes, I hate spam. Yes, I have an email that I put on the inbox. I quit mail.app. When I run mail.app again the mail is back to the trash.
