Moving mail from 10.6 to 10.8... new computer <body> I'm setting up a new computer and wanted to get my email contacts from 10.6.8 to 10.8.5 in Apple mail. I exported the mailboxes and I set up the accounts already... but no contacts show up when emailing. I tried copying the plist, but doesn't do anything. Will I have to copy the whole mail folder? I didn't want to muck this up since I already imported the mailboxes and set up the accounts?  <answer115178> If you're talking about the people that appear because they're previous recipients…  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xBBeo.png" alt="Previous Recipients"  You can move these people by selection them from the Previous Recipients list (Window → Previous Recipients) then Add to Contacts.  <comment134818> I don't have anything saved in contacts... it's the mail addresses that pop up when emailing from apple mail for years? <comment134819> Hmmmm... didn't realize that. So then I need to export contacts from old machine reimport to "contact" on new machine? Then they'll show up in mail??? <comment134820> @dhrose Yep, that'll do it. I've tried to find the preference file that holds the Previous Recipients, but I can't find it. Either way, the Add to Contacts method would still work.
