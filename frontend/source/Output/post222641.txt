Safari context menu search extension <body> Does safari has an extension like this Chrome extension called Context Menu Search? It enables user to search highlighted text from the context menu.  It should be something like this:img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/q6PuU.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer222659> It has built-in Dictionary &amp; Search with... on the right-click menu  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4Cmwr.png" alt="enter image description here"  I think the Search with… defaults to whatever your chosen search engine is.  The dictionary can also be triggered using kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd Opt ⌥ /kbd kbd D /kbd in many other apps/text areas.  <answer223829> I needed something similar too!  So look up: CustomSearch. It's highly adaptable by using the integrated CustomSearch Entry Editor.  "CustomSearch allows you to easily send the selected text to one of up to eight search engines — right from the toolbar or a contextual menu. CustomSearch includes search entries for Wikipedia, Google, Bing, and Amazon."  <comment269855> I've added an screenshot of what I am looking for. I hope i can choose from search engines from the menu.
