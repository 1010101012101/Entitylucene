iOS version distribution of my own app <body> Apple publishes the iOS version distribution across all devices:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Oc02Rm.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongIs there a way to see the iOS version distribution for a given app that I have published?/strong   <answer240147> In strongiTunes Connect Analytics/strong, select your app and go to strongMetrics → Active Devices/strong or strongSessions/strong and choose strongView By → Platform Version/strong. This will give you a breakdown of the iOS version installed per the category you selected.  Keep in mind this data only began reporting in iOS 8 and is opt-in only. You can hover the "Opt In Only" text to view the percentage of your users who have opted in which should provide a little guidance in extrapolation.  <comment295034> Based on what point in time? Point of purchase, point of latest upgrade, point of most recent use? <comment295038> Any would do, by most recent use is the best. <comment295138> Can I figure out the percentage of iOS 7 users from this feature? I am considering a feature that would not work in iOS 7, and would like to estimate the number of users I will be forcing out of the next update. <comment295179> @AdamMatan There are a few easy-to-integrate analytics platforms that do exactly what you want and so much more.
