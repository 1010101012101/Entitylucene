How can I change default settings for HP Laserjet Pro 100 Color MFP 175? <body> I've already created a new Preset configuration, but I cannot set it as the new default settings.  Anyone has any clues on achieving this?  <answer29974> What happens if you set the default settings from the browser going to the address http://localhost:631?  For example, I go to codehttp://localhost:631/printers/Canon_MX310_series/code and from there clicking on administration I can choose: codeSet Default Options/code. Those set there usually get respected.  <comment34407> Hey, that worked! Thanks a lot.
