Locking my machine causes my network Connection to sleep <body> Is there a way to lock my screen but not sleep my network connection? I step away from desk quite a bit and I lock the screen pretty much every time. When I come back I always from stepping away for like 5 minutes it seems like my machine has to reacquire an IP. This via ethernet. This is on a 2010 13' unibody macbook pro running Lion.  <answer41381> User Geraard's answer in this forum posting might help. The suggested settings changes seems to have fixed his problem:     ol   liClick the Apple Icon at top left of your screen.  /li   liSelect codeSystem Preferences/code.  /li   liSelect and open codeNetwork/code  /li   liAt the lower right select codeAdvanced/code  /li   liThis will bring up the   PPPoE screen with a menu bar showing TCP/IP, DNS, WINS, Proxies, PPP /li   liSelect codePPP/code to access the drop down menu and then you can make   changes. On the SECOND LINE PROMPTS: I change the value from code0/code minutes   to code999/code minutes.  This cured the Pop-up Message to Reconnect that was   happening./li   /ol   Apple support seems to concur:     strongIf you keep disconnecting from the Internet/strong      If you have to redial your dial-up modem Internet connection after not   using your computer for a few moments, or reconnect your PPPoE   connection, strongyour computer may be set to disconnect automatically   when the connection is idle/strong.      ol   liChoose codeApple menu &gt; System Preferences/code, and then click codeNetwork/code./li   liSelect your modem port (internal or external) or your PPPoE configuration from the Services list, and then click codeAdvanced/code./li   liClick codePPP/code, and then make sure the code“Disconnect if idle for __ minutes”/code checkbox is not selected, or if it is selected, increase the   number of minutes before that the computer will remain idle before   disconnecting./li   /ol   With luck, this setting change will solve your problem.  <answer41390> If your MacBook is plugged in I would try the following.  ol liChange the Engery Prefs to not spin down the disk or sleep the computer when it's plugged in./li liActivate the Screen Saver to turn on at a emhot/em corner./li liSet the Screen Saver prefs to require password to log back in./li /ol  Now see if activating the Screen Saver causes you to loose your assigned IP.  The alternate method is to manually assign an IP to your MacBook while you're at work.  <answer274189> Late answer, but in case anybody finds this via Google, as I did, entering the following in Terminal worked for me:     cd /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources;   sudo ./airport en1 prefs DisconnectOnLogout=NO   This changes the system pref that tells Airport to disconnect when the session is suspended (locked).  <comment161743> Is this still accurate? I do not see a "PPP" option under Advanced network settings for an Ethernet connection. <comment161751> @FGreg it does not exist on 10.9.3 <comment180381> This answer is now incorrect as the PPP option no longer exists. Any idea what the modern solution is?
