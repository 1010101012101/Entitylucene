iOS 9.1 Permanently remove third party keyboard <body> When going to Settings-General-Keyboard, one can remove a third party keyboard from the list of active keyboards. However, the keyboard will still show up as an option when adding a new keyboard. In particular, the keyboard titled "Emoji" still shows up as an option even after deleting the emoji app, and removing the keyboard. How can I delete this keyboard permanently?
