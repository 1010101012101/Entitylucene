Keyboard Shortcut :: Remove Google Chrome Bookmark <body> I keep accidentally typing kbdCommand + D/kbd in Google Chrome, because I'm used to that taking me to the Address Bar on Windows systems. This results in a bookmark being created.   My question is: How do I use the keyboard to reverse this action, to remove the bookmark that was created?  <answer211764> h3Edit/h3  To reverse and accidental bookmark, go to strongSystem Preferences/strong, turn on strongFull Keyboard Access/strong in the strongKeyboard Preferences/strong. Now one can use the kbdtab/kbd key to highlight the emRemove/em button then hit kbdreturn/kbd to reverse.  hr  Use kbd⌘/kbd+kbdL/kbd to highlight the URL thus taking you to the Address bar.  From Chrome Support:br ⌘+L Highlights the URL.  Takes a bit of retraining of muscle memory, but this is faster and is less complicated than trying to remap the Bookmark shortcut, which is built in by Google.  NOTE: This works in Safari and several other browsers too.  <comment255769> Thanks for your answer, but you didn't answer my question. I'm aware of the CMD + L shortcut to get to the address bar, but I sometimes type resort to CMD + D. My question is: once I've screwed up by pressing CMD + D, how do I undo it, using the keyboard? <comment255773> Oh, you mean undo the save bookmark?  It appeared to me from your question that you wanted to change the ⌘+D behavior.  Sorry, I misunderstood your question. <comment255777> Nope, I don't want to change the behavior. I want to reverse the accidental operation that I performed. What's the shortcut to hit "Remove" when the "bookmark added" box pops up? <comment255778> If you have [Full keyboard assess set on in your System prefs](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/211739/120171), you can tab to the button and hit enter. <comment255782> That is exactly what I needed, thank you! <comment255783> Sorry I misunderstood at first, glad it worked for you! Cheers!
