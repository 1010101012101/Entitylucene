UUID unregistration <body> I "registered my UUID" to acess iOS betas without a real developers acoount (I know, bad move). I don't remember the site anymore, looks like I've deleted the email.  Now, I want to buy a real developer account to start developing for iOS.  What if I re-register my UID?  TIA
