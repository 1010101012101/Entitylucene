Google chrome auto refresh <body> When I try to load a page in Google Chrome without Wi-Fi and then turn on Wi-Fi the page refreshes automatically.  I do not want this because I don't have time to turn on a VPN before the page loads.  How do I prevent this?  emThis is not tab discarding. Sorry to anyone who misunderstood the question./em  <answer281049> It is actually Tab Discarding...  You can take a look here chrome://discards/  If you want to disable then go to chrome://flags, and disable this flag: #automatic-tab-discarding  https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/chrome/huyGBMWpM4w  <answer281065> Per this answer, it seems like setting Chrome's "Offline Auto-Reload Mode" flag to "disabled" should do what you want?  <answer281068> Based on your reply to my first answer I think I have a little more clarity, so you may want to do both.  If you want to disable then go to chrome://flags, and disable this flag: #enable-offline-auto-reload  <comment353614> No, it is not tab discarding. What will happen is that I will visit a webpage without internet access, and Chrome will display a page saying "You are offline" or whatever. Then when your internet comes back up, **Chrome will automatically refresh the page** <comment353620> I believe it only does this for the first page yes and not all the tabs? <comment353952> Thanks for the answer! Exactly what I was looking for.
