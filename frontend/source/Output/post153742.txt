Is it safe to uninstall SIMBL agent on Yosemite? <body> I'm running the most resent version of Yosemite and have noticed something called SIMBL Agent in the login items setting. I've tried to remove it but when I do it my computer locks up and I can't get rid of it. I've done some research into and I'm just wondering if someone knows how to get rid of it. I've read that it's something to do with Apple developers.  <answer229757> SIMBL is an app to "hack" (inject) code in OS X (eg: add plugins to the Finder etc).  If your computer is yours (not controled by an adminsys or you company (if relevant)) it should be safe to remove it.  And since latest version of OS X (10.11) is sort of broken due to the introduction of SIP by Apple (System Integrity Protection).  To uninstall SIMBL you can do the following  h1Uninstall SIMBL on OS X 10.11/h1  h2Disable SIP/h2  ul liShutdown your computer/li liRestart by holding cmd+r/li liStart recovery partition/li liStart “Terminal” from the menubar/li li$ csrutil disable; reboot/li /ul  Source: http://osxdaily.com/2015/10/05/disable-rootless-system-integrity-protection-mac-os-x/  h2Uninstall SIMBL/h2  $ locate SIMBL | sudo xargs rm -rf  Source: https://superuser.com/a/421002/381999  h2Enable SIP back/h2  ul liShutdown your computer/li liRestart by holding cmd+r/li liStart recovery partition/li liStart “Terminal” from the menubar/li li$ csrutil enable; reboot/li /ul  Et voilà! Now SIMBL and all plugins have been completely removed from your computer, and SIP is still enabled.  <answer256637> The easiest way to uninstall SIMBL is to run the its bundled uninstaller. You can get a copy from the official website.  After the uninstallation check if these folders are present:  ul licode~/Library/Application Support/SIMBL/code/li licode/Library/Application Support/SIMBL/code/li /ul  If they are present you can easily delete them.  Since OS X 10.11+ SIMBL gets broken due to the introduction of SIP by Apple (System Integrity Protection).  There is no need to disable SIP before the process and re-enable it later.
