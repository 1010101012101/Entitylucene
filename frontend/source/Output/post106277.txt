How do you color code folders in Mavericks? <body> I used to be able to color code each folder in Finder.   I know I can use tags in Mavericks, but is there a way to restore the ability to actually color code folders?  Thanks.  <answer106329> Unlike colours, tags one not mutually exclusive. You can set multiple tags for one file.   This may explain why Finder no longer displays the colour like before.   Sadly, it will only display a maximum of three colours on the right of the filename. It looks like these three colours are the last three in the list.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dh85x.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer106334> 2 solutions to color tag files:    ul liHow to add, change and delete Tags in OS X 10.9 Mavericks/li liTag your files with drag and drop in OS X Mavericks/li /ul  <answer106918> You might be interested in downloading Folder Magic. It lets you easily assign colours to folders (which makes them very easy to differentiate).  <answer106981> As there doesn't appear to be a good solution to our problem, this allows you to use your coloured icons on the sidebar to help you locate folders visually by larger colored areas of the screen:  https://www.macupdate.com/app/iphone/43078/sideeffects  <answer107003> Interestingly enough, there are several Applications which can act as a finder replacement and which display the Folder Labels in 10.9 as well as the Background like in 10.8, 10.7 etc.:  ul liPathfinder/li liForklift/li liTransmit (FTP-Client)/li /ul  So the feature is not completly gone, the 10.9-Finder just don't display it. Let's hope someone finds a Hack to get coloring back.   <answer108013> h2remember to tell Apple.

By my understanding, Tags basically replace Labels, but they're functionally equivalent... <comment124871> @DanJ Yes, using the colour on the whole width of the column in column mode for example <comment124875> As Antoine said, it made for very easy recognition. so for example, bills to be paid were grey, while paid bills were green, etc. I know we can tag things now, and we'll get used to it, but it was nice to be able to scroll through a folder and see everything. Now, we have to filter everything.. <comment124877> Thanks Antoine.. I'll hold out a bit before changing our business process. +1 for explanation. <comment124907> That's extremely helpful, thanks Lukas. We'll give it a shot <comment125013> This is problematic in the case where the filename column (in list view) or the file's column (in column view) is expanded to show long file names; or, when the folders are deeply nested, and the window is scrolled.  The dots on the right side disappear unless the window is also resized or the right-side of the column is scrolled back into view. <comment125015> From the example, it looks it chooses the last three tag colors from the list.  By itself, this doesn't break anyone's current workflow, since only one color could be assigned to any particular file before 10.9; but, it's an odd design choice to display only three, if there is sufficient space to show more. <comment125477> Thank you. Welcome to AskDifferent! This is exactly what I wanted. I just don't want to disrupt the business process at this time..
