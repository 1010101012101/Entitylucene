How to make a bootable disc in Yosemite? <body> Many searches and tutorials all showed that if you drop an code.iso/code file in codeDisc Utility/code and go to codeBurn/code it will make a bootable disc but when I do it in Yosemite it will burn a copy of the code.iso/code file.

This will run the app with appropriate settings. When ready, hit the emBurn/em button.  Should work in emEl Capitan/em and emSierra/em macOS as well.  <comment227570> I ended up here trying to create a readable, much less bootable, Ubunto boot DVD-R from an iso. Your steps seem to be the same steps as described in [this thread](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5132196), except you left off a very important note: `Depending on what OS built the .iso, the result may not be readable by your Mac...` So I was following your directions, but thinking they were still failing because the result wasn't readable, though it turned out the result did work as a boot DVD on my other system. <comment227571> If there is a difference i will go back ans check but i posted this because all the research i couldn't figure out why it didnt work.  I still use this approach so if you are saying a particular ISO file isnt working let me know and ill test.
