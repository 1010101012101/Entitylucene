Unable to successfully format a secondary HDD? <body> I installed a secondary HDD in my MacBook Pro in the CD drive tray using a caddy. In my main drive slot I have an SSD which works fine. The 500GB drive I had before, I decided to put in the caddy and replace the CD drive with it.  I can't format my secondary HDD using Disk Utility through the command line tool. I keep getting stuck on "Waiting for partitions to activate" when trying to format using Disk Utility.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/c6xto.png" alt=""  Here is some info from the command line I got on the drive:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FTEsj.png" alt=""  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RGPFi.png" alt=""  It seems like it has no partitions. Here's more info from codegpt/code:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WmdET.png" alt=""  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CEkIl.png" alt=""  I also ran codetestdisk/code analysis on the disk:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TBLZO.png" alt=""  What should I do? I used to have this disk in an external caddy and used as a backup HD but I wanted it back in my Mac since I needed more space.  strongUPDATE 1/strong I've tried the following, as suggested by one of the comments.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LwrXd.png" alt=""  <comment328711> Tried `sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/disk2 count=1 bs=512` already? You may also use count=40 to nullify any partition table content. Check the proper disk identifier with `diskutil list` first! Then destroy and create a new GUID pt with `sudo gpt destroy ...` and `sudo gpt create -f ...`. <comment328720> @klanomath I have and got `Input/output error` in both cases. <comment328722> Then I would suspect the cable or the connectors to be faulty (or not properly connected)! Which kind of MBP do you exactly have? Some with a 3GBit/s SATA link for the DVD drive don't work properly with 6GBit/s HDDs. <comment328723> @klanomath I have the `MacBookPro9,2`. I think you might be right with the speed thing. When I look into System Report and under SATA, and select the port which has the new HDD, I see `Link Speed: 6 Gigabit` and `Negotiated Link Speed: 3 Gigabit` while for the SSD that is in the main bay that works, I see `6 Gigabit` for both. <comment328730> Hmm I don't know. At least the [HTS545050A7E362](http://www.hdsentinel.com/storageinfo_details.php?lang=en&model=HITACHI%20HTS545050A7E362) provides a SATAII (3 GBit/s) interface only. <comment328731> @klanomath I'll try ordering a new SATA 3GB/s HDD (probably [this one](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Toshiba-MQ01ABD100-5400RPM-9-5mm-Internal/dp/B009AYVNMQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1480085219&sr=8-1&keywords=2.5%2Binch%2Bsata%2B3%2Bgb&th=1)) and if that doesn't work them I'm guessing its either the cable or the connector.
