How do I record video on iOS with external audio interface? <body> I would like to record a camera video on my iPad, but I do not want to use the internal microphone.  I have a USB audio interface connected with the Camera Connection Kit, and the interface works flawlessly in audio apps. I can record multichannel audio no problem. iOS sets the audio interface as default audio device, so it's usually plug in &amp; record, easy.  But the iOS camera app doesn't seem to work with the audio interface - it records silence when the audio interface is connected.  I want to record the video from the camera, and audio from the audio interface inputs.  Anyone found a way to do this with either a built-in or a free app? Thanks!  <answer247496> On your iOS device, launch Camera App. Select the desired recording setting (eg. Video).  THEN plug in your external Audio Interface.  Record. It will take in whatever is on channels 1 and 2 and record with your video stream.  NOTE: If you either close the Camera App, power down the iOS device, iOS device goes to sleep or you disconnect your interface - you will need to repeat the above procedure to capture again.  Other issue, these is NO INDICATION you are recording audio from the external interface - so you may want to test the procedure a few times to make sure you know it works for you so you can reproduce exactly in a real situation.  <answer291298> Agree with previous answer, tested on IOS 10.3.2 iPhone SE with Zoom H5 as audio device.  MUST run built-in camera app first and select video mode.  Set the H5 to iPad audio I/F device first, then plug-in.  I did find however that switching apps or re-running camera app did not cause the audio feed to stop.  Unplugging H5 though did, then you have kill camera app and restart H5 to re-establish audio feed from H5.  As above, there is still no indication of audio source in use.  Prove your process before using for real.  <comment334714> failed. does not work. sorry but this is not an answer <comment349159> This actually does work with the iconnectaudio4+ <comment367773> Hi, and welcome to Ask Different!
