How to create custom Automator tasks for distribution -- OS X 10.10 <body> h2Problem/h2  I would like to make custom tasks for Automator to send to friends who are learning or even just to make new Automator apps easer to write without having to repeat the same tasks over and over. For example: run shell command (uptime) - speak text - copy to clipboard  Would it be at all possible to make a task called Uptime and use one task instead of three?  Any help would be appreciated :)  <answer239019> Using your example, "emFor example: run shell command (uptime) - speak text - copy to clipboard/em" and to answer your question, "emWould it be at all possible to make a task called Uptime and use one task instead of three?/em", yes... Simply add one Run Shell Script emAction/em  to your Automator emWorkflow/em and add the following code:  precodeuptime | pbcopy pbpaste | say /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yT7Ky.png" alt="enter image description here"  This empipes/em the output of codeuptime/code to the emclipboard/em and then empipes/em the content of the emclipboard/em to the codesay/code command.  The output of the codeuptime/code command is still on the emclipboard/em to paste elsewhere, either by additional commands and or using the keyboard and or other normal methods of pasting from the emclipboard/em.  strongNote:/strong I'm assuming that when you say "emuse one task instead of three/em", you're actually referring to an Automator Action, e.g. Run Shell Script, not the number of commands written into that on Action.
