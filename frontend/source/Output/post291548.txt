My menu bar is reloading all the time and I have no idea why <body> My menu bar is reloading all the time and I have no idea why. My OSX version is 10.12.5. Any idea ?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xeJP5.gif" alt="top right icons reload all the time"  Thank you  <comment368106> Not really sure but I am wondering if you have an app that is doing this or there are so many icons that it overfills the menu bar. I would start with removing menu bar items one at a time. Usually if you hold down Command you can drag an icon off the menu bar to remove it. <comment368122> I'd look into MacKeeper before installing it.  Some consider it malware. <comment368156> hmmm your version is 10.12.5 well you don't need to upgrade you Mac but i recommend installing MacKeeper it is the only antivirus that is only for mac.
