How to remove Landesk Core's proxy setting completely in OS X? <body> today my Little Snitch detect my proxyhost has requested outgoing connection to Landesk Core even though it has been removed. How can I reset the proxy settings? (FYI, they are not in system settings.)  <answer126759> This is not a network setting, there are still likely components left behind. Probably the best place to ask this question would be landesk.com. For example  http://community.landesk.com/support/thread/16347
