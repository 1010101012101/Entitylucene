And even then, codermdir/code won't remove a folder that contains anything beyond the artificial links to code./code and code../code.  Both of these limitations can be overcome by providing the code-r/code switch (short for coderecursive/code) to coderm/code as in coderm -r list_of_files_or_folders/code. If asked to remove a folder, it will first remove everything inside, and then invoke codermdir/code internally to get rid of the folder. Subfolders are removed the same way, to any depth.  coderm/code will complain if asked to remove something that can't be removed. However, adding the code-f/code switch (short for codeforce/code) tells it to make a best effort to overcome any obstacles that may come up. If it can't delete something either because it's locked or because its permissions say it can't be deleted, emand/em you own the file, then as file owner you could unlock the file and/or change its permissions. With code-f/code, the coderm/code command will do these things silently without pestering you about it.

The same applies for copying the folder or moving it around. The Pain.jpg - though really a PITA regarding proper display - doesn't seem to be a virus.  The problems in Finder and sandbox probably occur because of the strange naming of the file: mixed roman and hebrew chars. Hebrew only file names are notated right to left (see second picture). Additionally some filesystem damage may had happened.  My advices are:    ul lilike others already mentioned: try to repair your main volume with 'Disk Utility' after rebooting to Recovery Mode  /li limove the file to another folder, wait some time and move it back to its origin until you see the preview image. Check your logs for the sandbox messages (see above).   /li litry to execute codefind . -inum &lt;inode&gt; -exec rm {} \;/code after successfully using codels -aBeil/code to get the inode of 'Pain.jpg'. In my case that would have been: codefind . -inum 581871 -exec rm {} \;/code  /li lireboot to Recovery Mode and try to execute the last command (codefind . -inum &lt;inode&gt; -exec rm {} \;/code) after repairing the filesystem./li litry to execute rm 'P\ ͎̮͉͍ͨ̈́̾̈́A\ ͎̮͉͍ͨ̈́̾̈́I\ ͎̮͉͍ͨ̈́̾̈́N\ ͎̮͉͍ͨ̈́̾̈́.jpg'/li /ul  <answer168352> Perhaps it is not possible because you file is in an folder that is located in the download folder? Place back the files on your desktop, open the folder 'downloads' and delete what's in that folder.

When I run the first command in terminal, everything hides on my desktop, then running your second command, desktop files appears again. <comment197353> I also moved `Reactions` folder out of `Downloads`, and again deleted the files and emptied trash.

I downloaded about 1400 pics via magnet link with µtorrent. i skipped most of them retaining only those with special chars. there was no *.dmg to download. <comment197598> @klanomath, thanks for your informative answer ... <comment197599> @danielAzuelos, I also had a collections of photos from torrents and this image perhaps was one of them ... I remember I noticed that there was an `exe` file inside the folder containing the `pain.jpg` image and unfortunately it was late because perhaps it was already executed when the folder opened.. I was able to remove the original folder containing the images with such names the day before yesterday with no problem .. <comment197602> `find . -inum 581871 -exec rm {} \;` note: 581871 is the inode please check the first column of `ls -aBeil` result <comment197606> In case it's of interest, here are the unicode values of the string of combining diacritics used after each latin character in the name of that file:  P 034e;032e;0349;034d;0368;0308;0301;033e;0308;0301; <comment197610> @nelson i had no problem to delete the folder or the containing files - before and after moving it. Your command is useful but it seems like the OP can't execute `ls -aBeil` and get the proper inode number for the file. <comment197656> @klanomath: I forget a key point. If your `LANG=en_US.UTF-8`, then any char is printable and the `-B` isn't of much help. To use it efficiently one should enter `unset LANG ; ls -aBeil`. <comment197659> @danielAzuelos What a question and what a problem. I would like to swear here extensively now in written form. you are right `rm P....jpg` doesn't work and neither `rm 'P%20....jpg'` because the file name is too long. <comment197664> @danielAzuelos, it was not `.exe`, as far as I remember, it was like `Unix Executable File` and disappeared once I tried to check the `Name` and `Kind` on it.. <comment197667> @Sami Did you try to check your volume with Disk Utility? And does `ls -aBeil` give an inode number for P/*a/*i/*n.jpg? <comment197669> Open Disk Utility and run "Check volume" on your main drive. It you get errors requiring a repair, boot into Recovery Mode, run Disk Util from there and use "Repair volume" <comment197670> The FS of Sami is clearly damaged. But there is something wrong around this file name. @klanomath, could you run your 1st `ls` with the corrective `unset LANG` immediatly after the download of the suspicious file or disk image. A running `opensnoop` would be interesting. <comment197671> @danielAzuelos Sure give me some minutes <comment197676> @patrix, pls take a look at update 4 <comment197678> "Illegal name", I actually like that. Please proceed as explained in the dialog box in the lower window, and then (once you have Disk Utility running in Recovery Mode) select "Repair Disk" (instead of verify). Afterwards reboot as usual and try emptying the trash again. <comment197680> @danielAzuelos here is [opensnoop](http://www62.zippyshare.com/v/wBfMZFo0/file.html) and [unset LANG ; ls -aBeil](http://pastebin.com/WfbRiZAT) <comment197687> @danielAzuelos additionally [fseventer-pic](http://i.stack.imgur.com/WdV3F.jpg) which is much easier to examine than opensnoop <comment197721> @patrix, thank you patrix, it worked. pls take a look at update 5. <comment197776> @klanomath: I was able to read the files dropped on imgur.com, pastebin.com, but not the one on zippyshare.com (opensnoop log). Does the error message "No such file or directory" disappear at the end of the download? Is your FS corrupted after the end of the download (Illegal name)? <comment197778> @danielAzuelos You can't download directly from zippyshare. You have to open the page and hit the big orange 'Download Now' button in the upper right corner. Probably your NoScript-Extension prevents you from downloading it. It should work - i just d/led it again. Or use a download manager like JDownloader... <comment197781> This answer is risky. The `.Trash` doesn't get the default ACL it has by default. Moreover on a corrupted FS it won't work. It's easier to say this now that we know the FS is damaged :). <comment197796> I'm really sorry but this server is unusable.
