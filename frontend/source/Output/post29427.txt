Is there a good free DWG viewer for Mac OS X? <body> There are new Autodesk products (AutoCAD LT or similar) for Mac OS and iOS, but I couldn't find a simple free DWG viewer for Mac.  <answer29429> The free eDrawings Viewer for Mac claims to be able to read and display DWG files. The Microspot DWG Viewer also provides support for DWG files.  I don't have any DWG files to test these two products on at the moment, but they're worth a shot.  <answer29433> AutoCAD WS is a free app on the Mac App Store. I've never tried it.  <answer260463> I did try the eDrawings Viewer for Mac but it doesn't allow do measurements and printing is not great neither. I finally found viewer which has all what I was looking for - ZWCAD Viewer. Get it from "cnet.com" as I couldn't find it on the ZWSOFT home page.  <answer260470> h2A360 Viewer/h2  AutoCAD's A360 Viewer is a browser based tool for viewing codeDWG/code files:     strongA360 Viewer/strong Free online viewer - View designs in more than 50 file formats, including .dwg, right in your browserâ€”no downloads or plug-ins needed.   h2LibreCAD/h2  LibreCAD is open source, free, and can read and write codeDWG/code files.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AVExu.png" alt="LibreCAD"  <comment99036> Has 16MB file size limit. And you have to register to Autodesk (or already have their account). Otherwise seemed okay.
