Is it possible to develop for iOS10 and deploy to a personal iPad for testing without a developer account? <body> I know that there is one way to do this with XCODE 7, however this doesn't seem to be working for me, possibly because I'm on iOS10? I have an app that I'd like to deploy on to my iPad before I decide to sign up for a developer account. Is there any way to achieve this.   <answer259083> You don't need a developer account but you do need a Mac.  These points are taken from this blog:  h2In order to take advantage of this, you’ll need three things:/h2  ol liXcode 7/li liiOS 9 (minimum)/li liA free Apple ID/li /ol  h2To start, you’ll need to set up a provisioning profile to code sign your apps:/h2  ol liOpen Xode preferences (Xcode  Preferences…)/li liClick the ‘Accounts’ tab/li liLogin with your Apple ID (+  Add Apple ID…)/li liOnce you’ve successfully logged in, a new ‘Personal Team’ with the role ‘Free’ will appear beneath your Apple ID. br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/M449b.jpg" alt="enter image description here"/li /ol  There's a few more details that you can view on that site.  <comment324035> I tried this with my iPad and Mac and was able to add the AppleID successfully. However, I was unable to deploy to my iPad, I received a warning "Could not find developer disk image" and it did not let me proceed further. [This](http://stackoverflow.com/a/34648168/5451769) comment seems to suggest that it is not possible to do with XCODE7, since my iPad is on iOS10. Any thoughts? Does this work with XCODE8?   I won't be able to test this right now unfortunately, since it looks like I have to upgrade my operating system to download the latest XCODE8.1
