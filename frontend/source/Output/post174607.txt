Export a changed Bundle from Textmate 2 <body> How do I export a Bundle with changes (delta) from Textmate 2?  I have installed the Bundle manually and it appears in the code~/Library/Application Support/Avian/Pristine Copy/Bundles/code directory.  But I've made edits with the bundle editor so there are also "delta" files in code~/Library/Application Support/Avian/Bundles/code  Is there a way to merge these or export a combined version besides manually editing as XML?  <comment205606> Looks like I might have messed up when installing itâ€¦ It default installs to the Pristine Copy folder when you automatically install a tmBundle (like from double-clicking in finder). It mentions that you need to install bundles you intend to work on in `~/Library/Application Support/Avian/Bundles` -http://blog.macromates.com/2011/locating-bundles/
