OS X Yosemite spotlight search wikipedia and web content missing <body> One of the new features in spotlight was supposed to be information from wikipedia, web when anything was searched. However, I don't seem to be getting this information when I search in spotlight. Is this feature only available in certain countries? (Im in India, and all the reviews I've read about Yosemite are US or Europe based websites).  <answer151436> This feature is not available in India.  <answer152074> This could be related: https://www.apple.com/ios/feature-availability/#spotlight-suggestions-spotlight-suggestions  It's a list of countries that have Spotlight Suggestions enabled in iOS 8. If this is true, this is a pretty bad move from Apple.  Source: macrumors discussion  strongUPDATE/strong: Apple confirms that     Spotlight Suggestions may not be available in all regions.   on the Spotlight support page.  <answer163387> Appart from @shrx correct answer there is a second issue with Yosemite's new Spotlight feature:   On my system I was able to enable Wikipedia and Web content by aligning my system's region and language settings.

I have the same problem and am curious to see if anyone has a solution here. <comment178621> I have the same problem. I'm in Slovenia, setting the `Preferred language` to English and `Region` to United States does not help. <comment192023> Can confirm this worked for me!
