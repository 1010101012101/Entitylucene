How to use SSL tunnelling on OS X to give full internet access to some applications while you are on a restricted corporate network? <body> How to use SSL tunnelling on OS X to give full internet access to some applications while you are on a restrictive corporate network?  Details:  ul liyou want to be able to access some restricted destinations and/or ports with some applications from your computer but you are on a restricted network (corporate) - Even using a Torrent client./li liyou have an AWS machine running Ubuntu that you can use as a proxy (and you can SSH to this machine)/li liYou cannot create a full VPN because this means that you will loose access to your intranet and you do not want that./li /ul  <answer56898> Assuming that you are running Lion or greater, I would recommend that you create an OS X virtual machine (using VMware Fusion or Parallels Desktop) and route that through a full VPN.    Alternatively, if you have a Mac at home, you could just use VNC or some other remote desktop solution and run your applications from there.  <answer76646> You can create a local SOCKS proxy by using the dynamic port forwarding function of SSH by running codessh/code with the code-D/code flag. This will tunnel all traffic of applications that use the local SOCKS proxy through SSH connection.  For example running codessh -D1234 user@host/code will open a SOCKS proxy on localhost port code1234/code that you can direct your applications to.  <comment65332> Please be aware that doing this is a security risk, and if you are seen bypassing corporate firewalls (*especially* with torrent sites), you can get into serious trouble. <comment65333> Do you have a handle on the network routing needed to choose between intranet and internet or the basics of using SSL tunneling? If you have solved one of these - it will help someone propose a workable configuration of the other. (there are three questions here - basic SSL tunneling, basic network routing, and understanding both well enough to synthesize a solution to make both work for the situation...)
