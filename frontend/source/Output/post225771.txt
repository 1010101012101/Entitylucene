QuickLook process has a file open multiple times <body> I was cleaning up my Mac (on El Capitan 10.11.2), and I tried to delete some obscure old Word file. When I clicked on "empty trash", it gave me the message that the file was being used. I didn't know what was using it, and didn't want to cause problems, so I used codelsof | grep /Users/myusername/.Trash/code and found that the QuickLook process had it open 12 times! Should I delete the file? Why on earth does Quick Look have it open at all?  PS: I quick-looked the file again and ran codelsof | grep -c /Users/myusername/.Trash/code, which told me that it was then open 18 times, in case that helps.  <answer225798> Try running codeqlmanage -r/code. This should reload QuickLook and make it so it's no longer focused on those files. You can also try using something like Trash It! if after restarting and relaunching/killing Finder and QuickLook does nothing.  <comment274179> Yeah, I'll just use `rm` eventually. I'm kind of just curious as to why this might happen.
