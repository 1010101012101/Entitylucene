iPad - Drafts folder mystery <body> iPad setup strongExchange sync/strong.    I create a draft email, then go to the strongdraft folder/strong and its there.   I then go back to the inbox on the iPad and after it syncs, I go back to the drafts folder and it loads up drafts from 2000-2013 but strongdoes not contain my most recent draft/strong.   If I go to inbox and back to drafts a few times then it will display my draft again minus the drafts from 2000-2013.    I then bounce back and forth a few times and it will go back to the original draft again but never display them at the same time.    Also, some draft messages have gone into the abyss never to be found.  Any suggestions would be great.  Mark    <comment110555> Let's see if anyone has a ready answer.
