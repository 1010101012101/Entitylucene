Removing the black edge of external monitor connecting to mac air <body> I have a laptop which is Mac air 13' with OS.X.Yosemite.    When I use strongVGA cable/strong with strongMiniDP to VGA transformer/strong to connect my monitor(23' Dell P2314H) and set the resolution to code1920x1080/code to fit the monitor panel.     But there is a black edge on the left side showing like:     img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dVWwn.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  How to remove the black edge? Is it related to the strongVGA connecting  mode/strong?  <comment310910> Are you mirroring your screen or extending your desktop? <comment310915> I choose `mirroring` my screen. <comment310922> It sounds like you have a resolution on your MBA that is 4:3 or 5:4, not 16:9 or 16:10.  You have to select a resolution that is common to both screens for the black bars to go away.
