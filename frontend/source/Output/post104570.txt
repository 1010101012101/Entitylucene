How to search Mail in Time Machine? <body> I'm looking for a specific email I may have deleted, but I don't remember when I received it (it was at least a couple months ago).  Digging through my Mail history in Time Machine for a single email would take forever - why isn't there an obvious search function for Time Machine?  Does anyone have a technique or strategy for searching past emails in Time Machine?  <answer104582> The recommended way to search through codeTime Machine/code is using codeSpotlight/code.  From Apple Support - Recover items using Time Machine and Spotlight:     ol   liOpen a Finder window and type a search word or phrase in the search field in the upper-right corner./li   liSelect a location to search in the location bar.   You can search your entire computer (This Mac) or the folder that was selected in the Finder when you started your search. New search results begin to appear after you select a location./li   liRefine the results by specifying search criteria.br   Narrow down Spotlight search results/li   liClick the Time Machine icon in the Dock.   If the Time Machine icon isnâ€™t in the Dock, look for Time Machine in the Applications folder./li   liUse the arrows and the timeline along the right edge of your screen to browse through the Time Machine backups. Your search is performed in every window./li   liWhen you find the item you want to restore, select it, and then click Restore./li   /ol   As another alternative, you can also use the free EasyFind application from Devon Technologies on your codeTime Machine/code drive.  <answer154450> Emails are stored in sub-directories located in code~/Library/Mail/V2/code in .emlx format. This allows you to do a global plaintext search within a specific time machine backup folder.  I wrote a shell script to search for text within all .emlx files in a specific time machine backup.  Alternatively you can do a drive search in terminal (what my script automates). Replace Search Query with what you want to search for:  precodefind "/Volumes/Time Machine" -name "*.emlx" -exec grep -l "Search Query" {} \; /code/pre  Or also replace code/Volumes/Time Machine/code with a more specific directory to speed things up e.g code/Volumes/Time Machine/Backups.backupdb/stan/2014-09-16-084603//code  <comment200473> very helpful. Mine was in "Time Machine Backups" and I tabbed into it (after `cd /Volumes`) without quotes so `Time\ Machine\ Backups/etc...`
