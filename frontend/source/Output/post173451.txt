Mac Speakers Malfunction <body> My speakers stopped working.  All of the other sources say that I need to blow air into the headphone jack, or type  precodesudo killall coreaudiod /code/pre  In my terminal window.  I have not seen anyone put a screen shot like the one I am getting though.  Is this the same problem?  I have not gotten around to trying these yet but I will today, if they don't work what else should I try?    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zuBtM.png" alt=""  <answer173475> I've seen that image when I plugged in a hdmi monitor that didn't have any speakers on it. My computer switched to hdmi audio out and there wasn't anything to output the audio.   If you are using an external hdmi monitor like that, go to:   System Preferences  Sound  Output   and select your speakers.  <comment204085> Rather than asking if you have the same problem, let's remove that and have you list conclusively what you've tried. Once an edit is made, we can release the temporary hold. <comment204086> The same problem appears to me when I remove my headphones. If you did that and it appeared, try to reinsert them and then remove them again. I'm not really into blowing air into the jacks!
