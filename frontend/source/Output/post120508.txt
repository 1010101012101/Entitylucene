text alignment shortcut RTL and LTR <body> When in text box in any application, such as search text boxes, address fields in Finder and Safari, or even inside sites such as Google's search text box:  I use kbdcmd/kbd + kbdspace/kbd to switch the language with which I type. But I want also to switch from right-to-left to left-to-right. How do I do that on Mac with and without a shortcut?  <comment140536> I don't know whether it works in the contexts you are talking about, but Apple's info on the question is at http://support.apple.com/kb/PH14203 <comment140541> @TomGewecke thanks. I tried your suggestion. It works in some text boxes, like the "find" text box that appears when hitting cmd + f in the browser. It didn't work in text boxes that show up inside sites (such as Google Search and this comment's text box...).
