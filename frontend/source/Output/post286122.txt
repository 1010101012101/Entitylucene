Dock freezing and right click and expose doesn't work <body> I don't know why, but there are some very strange problems with my system. At times, the right click will stop working on both the mouse and trackpad, only ctrl+click will work.  At the same time when pointing the mouse in the corner, it doesn't respond well. If I move the mouse over an icon in the dock, The dock will freeze, with the app icon stay "magnified". If I move the pointer over the dock, that icon stay larger.  I can click on any other icon, that don't move ( enlarge ) as usual and the app can be open.  The only solution it's to reinstall Sierra.  I try to come back with Time Machine...nothing. Disk Utility...nothing. Bitdefender Virus and Malware scan...nothing. I've tried to reinstall the MacOS but after two days the problem appears again. I've tried to not use some applications in the background, but until now I can't understand if some of that cause the problem. What can I do? How I can understand if there are some app that is causing the problem?  Thank you in advance  <comment360928> could you please tell us your version, and what computer you are using? - From Review <comment360956> Sorry I use MacOS Sierra 10.12.5 (16F73) MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015) 2,5 GHz Intel Core i7 16 GB 1600 MHz DDR3 Intel Iris Pro 1536 MB <comment360957> I've just noticed another issue.
