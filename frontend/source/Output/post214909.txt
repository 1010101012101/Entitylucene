How to change "Nov 9 03:21:11" to yymmdd mmhhss using AppleScript/Unix? <body> How to change string "Nov 9 03:21:11" to yymmdd mmhhss in AppleScript?  <answer214911> Date and time manipulation strikein AppleScript/strike is painful. See Conversion: String-Date to AppleScript-Date and Dates &amp; Times in AppleScripts for helpful snippets and an overview of approaches.  The general approach appears to be to hand code the parsing and conversion. For your example:  precodeset myStringDate to "Nov 9 03:21:11"  set theMonth to first word of myStringDate set theDayOfMonth to second word of myStringDate set theHour to third word of myStringDate set theMinute to fourth word of myStringDate set theSecond to fifth word of myStringDate  -- TODO: Add code to convert month to a number set theConvertedMonth to theMonth  -- Determine the year somehow  set myTransformedDate to "YEAR" &amp; theConvertedMonth &amp; theDayOfMonth &amp; " " &amp; theMinute &amp; theHour &amp; theSecond  -- Be aware of numbers of single digits; you may need to pad with zeros /code/pre  If you are comfortable with the command line, you may find it easier to resort to calling out to a shell script for the conversion.  <answer214920> I don't have a mac to test with, but the OSX codedate/code man page suggests:  precodeold="Nov 9 03:21:11" new=$( date -j -f "%b %e %T" "$old" "+%Y%m%d %H%M%S" ) echo "$new" /code/pre  I stongly recommend using 4-digit years. Have we learned nothing from Y2K?  <comment259542> Thanks. I'm interested in unix commands but don't know what unix commands i should check out. <comment259583> Thanks. I tried this and many variations but it fails:  do shell script "date -f \"%b %e %T\" 'Nov  9 12:12:12' \"+%Y%m%d %H%M%S\"" <comment259590> If `date` is not working for you, expand the AppleScript above. You can always [ask more questions](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/ask) about specific sections you need help with. <comment259879> Your `do shell script` is missing the `-j`.  `do shell script "date -j -f \"%b %e %T\" \"Nov 9 12:12:12\" \"+%Y%m%d %H%M%S\""` is what you need.
