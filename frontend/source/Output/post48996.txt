Unable to download an iOS app from iTunes Japan when I am using my Apple account registered in the USA <body> I'm trying to download the Denwacho Kantan Copy app for iOS so that I can transfer my contacts to my new softbank iPhone.  However, I am being told that I can't download this app with my American Apple ID account.  I have downloaded countless apps in Japan without having this problem.  Please help!  Kantan means easy in Japanese and this has been anything but easy.  I have already tried changing my apple ID to a Japanese one, but this cannot be done without a Japanese credit card...which is very difficult to acquire here for foreigners.  If I was able to purchase this phone using the security of my American credit card, why shouldn't I be able to do something simple like transfer my contacts?? Everything else works fine!  <answer48998> You can try following this procedure (Youtube Video) to create an Apple ID in iTunes without a Credit Card, substituting US for Japan.  You need to follow these steps to create an Apple ID with a U.S. address but without requiring a credit card:  ol liLaunch iTunes and switch to the iTunes store. Make sure you are not logged in./li liScroll to the bottom and change your country to United States./li liNext go to App store and download any of the free apps./li /ol  iTunes will now prompt you to create a new Apple account and this time, you’ll definitely see the ‘none’ option on the Payments screen.

This is a normal workflow of the iTunes app.
