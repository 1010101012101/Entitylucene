How can I activate my Iphone 4 without sim and wi-fi? <body> I have an old Iphone 4 with iOS 7.1.2 and I lost the carrier sim which it is locked,and the wi-fi  connection don't works at all, how can I activate it to use this like an Ipod?  (sorry for my bad english)  <answer197429> Get a sim don't activate it or use someone else's sim for a second. It's only locked to the provider so by a sim from that provider an no one else or borrow someone's who is with that provider or call that provider an ask them to unlock it   <answer197452> call the provider to unlock it. But you can use it without sim/wifi as an ipod: sync it to itunes in your PC/Mac, and put the music on it with iTunes.
