Where did my desktop preview icons go? <body> When I started up my MacBook today my preview icons where gone as can be seen by attached screenshot.  Any clue why they disappeared? And how to get them back?  Thanks!  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/e6HTp.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer238422> On the desktop, press Command+J or select Show View Options from the View menu to bring up the view options. From there, select "Show Icon Preview."  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Hr0sp.png" alt="Show Icon Preview"  <comment292553> Thanks! Strangely enough the problem had fixed itself already. My computer is a bit off this week. When I started uTorrent it said that it was started for the first time. So something strange is going on. I wish I knew what.
