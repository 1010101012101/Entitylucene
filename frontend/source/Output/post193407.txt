Macports keeps 3 different versions of LLVM installed <body> I am using the latest Macports 2.3.3 on OS X 10.10.3. I installed Gimp, Ufraw and Enblend (among others), which required py27-numpy, which gave me 2 different versions of LLVM:   precode$ port rdependents llvm-3.3 The following ports are dependent on llvm-3.3:   ld64-latest     ld64       clang-3.5       libgcc         py27-numpy           py27-pygtk             gimp2               gimp-app                 gimp               gimp-jp2               gimp-lqr-plugin               gutenprint               icns-gimp               ufraw               xsane           vigra             enblend  $ port rdependents llvm-3.4 The following ports are dependent on llvm-3.4:   cctools     libgcc       py27-numpy         py27-pygtk           gimp2             gimp-app               gimp             gimp-jp2             gimp-lqr-plugin             gutenprint             icns-gimp             ufraw             xsane         vigra           enblend /code/pre  For some reason, I even have llvm-3.5:  precode$ port rdependents llvm-3.5 The following ports are dependent on llvm-3.5:   clang-3.5 $ port rdependents clang-3.5 clang-3.5 has no dependents. /code/pre  This means that upgrading Macports builds LLVM 3 times in various versions, which takes a ton of time and heats up the Earth and whatnot :)  Is there any way to streamline this? Somehow tell the packages "go use llvm-3.5"?  <answer194375> I was forced to uninstall all packages depending on llvm-3.3 and llvm-3.4, and then reinstall them. In my case, all of reinstalled packages had dependencies on llvm-3.5, not on llvm-3.3/3.4, thus there were no problems when I uninstalled both llvm-3.3 and llvm-3.4. I hope it works for you.  <comment230534> It doesn't answer your question (hence the comment). I had the same problem with `port` installing many versions of Perl. When I heard about [homebrew](http://brew.sh) I took a day to migrate and haven't had the problem since. <comment230535> So what is it about homebrew that makes the situation better? <comment230536> It doesn't appear the suffer from the same issue of installing multiple versions of the same program. I've not looked into why/ it doesn't, but I no longer multiple versions of compilers/Perl/Python/etc.
