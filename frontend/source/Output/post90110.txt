How does an Apple device gets recognized as external storage on PC? <body> When I connect any apple device to my PC - it gets recognized as an external storage and I can access all the files (Update:Not all the files - but just pictures) on the device.   How is this possible? Do all the laptops and desktop motherboards come with an Apple authentication chip and drivers ?   I am working on a device which needs to read music files from Apple devices - so I am wondering whether I need to apply for MFI program. If the apple devices work as generic USB device without any chip and special drivers, then it serves my purpose.  <answer90124> iPhone will present itself as a digital camera to a USB host so you can use camera software to import photos, such as iPhoto.  <comment105788> It works like a USB device. <comment105790> That implies that I don't need to join the MFI program? So I wonder, that there are so many devices especially car head units which are MFI enabled - why did they go for the MFI if all they need is to scan the music and be able to play the files like a normal USB drive is inserted.
