Network Slow To Wake From Sleep <body> I have a MBP with Sierra that I use in clamshell mode with external monitor and keyboard on wired network connection. When I am not using it I put it to sleep from the menu.   It wakes up on a keypress nice and quick but network is unreachable for about 10 seconds. How do I get rid of this KGB lag?  <answer261977> If your Mac enters its full sleep state, then your network connections will be disconnected. Your Mac can not be connected to a network and be asleep at the same time.  You can avoid full sleep by setting your Computer Sleep to Never. Your MacBook will then sleep all the sub-systems possible when idle, but will remain awake enough to maintain a network connection.  PowerNap is not the same as full sleep. This is a special state controlled by Apple and, for now, available only to Apple's chosen processes.  <comment328117> Possible duplicate of [Keep wi-fi connection while asleep?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/119975/keep-wi-fi-connection-while-asleep) <comment328119> this is not a wi-fi issue, this is wired network <comment328168> Are you saying that it is quite normal that establishing network connection takes close to 10 seconds? My fedora connects in 2-3 secs. Are there any known tricks to speed it up, e.g.  bypassing dhcp discover with fixed IP?
