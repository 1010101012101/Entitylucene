Unable to mount remote directory using SSHFS <body> I installed SSHFS 3.5 via Homebrew on OSX 10.9. I try the following:  precode~$ mkdir link ~$ sshfs user@hostname:/path/to/dir/ ./link /code/pre  But I keep getting this error:  precodethe OSXFUSE file system is not available (-1) the OSXFUSE file system is not available (1) /code/pre  Any idea what I'm doing wrong?  <answer130842> Turns out it was just a case of RTFM. I needed to install the kernel extension too, like so:  precodesudo /bin/cp -RfX /usr/local/opt/osxfuse/Library/Filesystems/osxfusefs.fs /Library/Filesystems sudo chmod +s /Library/Filesystems/osxfusefs.fs/Support/load_osxfusefs /code/pre
