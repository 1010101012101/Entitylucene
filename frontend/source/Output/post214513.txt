Enable Terminal / iterm2 sound notification exclusively <body> Is there a way to enable the bell terminal and other sound notification from the terminal, while my "play user interface sound effect" setting is off ?  I don't like to have any sound notification (I prefer the flashing screen), but I'm using weechat and I wish I could enable some sound notification in it.  <answer214518> You can create separate profiles one with sound disabled (default) and one with sound enabled (for your codeweechat/code). These are available both in Terminal and iTerm2.  bTerminal/b img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XAd8b.png" alt="enter image description here"  biTerm2/b  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/M6EYl.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment259081> thanks for your answer and to took the time to take screenshot.  maybe I should have been clearer : in System Preferences / Sound / Sound effect , I disabled the "Play user interface sound effects", cause I don't want any sound from the U. So what I'm looking for is a solution to overwrite this setting just for the terminal/iterm2  maybe there is a way with a command line. <comment259084> For me that `Play user interface sound effects` settings doesn't have any effect on terminal bell sound (El Capitan 10.11.1) <comment259086> you are correct. I stand corrected - my alert volume was all the way down. sorry and thanks for your help <comment259088> but now, I wish I could get the alert for the terminal exclusively. any idea ? <comment259089> It disables sounds like dragging items to trash, but for sounds inside terminal the profile settings takes preference. Do you hear a bell in terminal window on pressing say F10 with `Play user interface sound effects` disabled but `Audible Bell` enabled? <comment259090> yes. just need to rise the `alert volume` a bit. do you have any idea how I could enable the alert sound just for the terminal ? <comment259091> With `Play user interface sound effects` disabled but `Audible Bell` in your terminal profile preferences enabled, you should be able to get what you are looking for (see screenshot).
