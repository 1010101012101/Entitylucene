How can I filter iTunes songs with spaces in them? <body> When I use the iTunes library text filter option to search for codelove with/code, I get the song codeI'm in love with the hero/code but also several hits for song titles where the words codelove/code or codewith/code appear separately. Is there any way to tell iTunes that I'm searching for a full string instead of separate words? If I enclose the search term in quotes like Google the filter doesn't return any hits, and the search question mark icon doesn't seem to have any other options that fields.  <comment192350> What if you search for "lovewith"? <comment192584> Could create a Smart Playlist with two options - one searches the Title field for "love", the other for "with". Granted it's not a great repeat solution (since it's more time-consuming to modify the Smart Playlist settings than to type in the search bar) but as a one-off it will work.
