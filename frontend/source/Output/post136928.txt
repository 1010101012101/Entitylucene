Using Alt/Cmd + Right/Left Arrow in iTerm <body> Is it possible to move between words in iTerm using Alt + Right/Left Arrows ? Now if I press Alt+Left I will get '[D' and '[C' if I press Alt+Right.  <answer136931> Go to iTerm Preferences → Profiles, select your profile, then the Keys tab. Find ⌥← and ⌥→ and set them to send escape sequence codeb/code and send escape sequence codef/code respectively.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HCNAe.png" alt="Mapping alt-right to move cursor forward by one word"  If you use ⌘→ and ←⌘ you will need to remap the next and previous tab shortcuts which are set to those as default. Terminal uses ⇧⌘→ and ⇧⌘← for these.  You can do this under Profiles, or just globally under Keys (shown below) if you wish to set it globally. Note that settings in Profiles override global settings in Keys.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ry7Zm.png" alt="Globally mapping alt-right to move cursor forward by one word"  <answer137071> If you use bash, you can also add  precode"\e\e[D": backward-word "\e\e[C": forward-word /code/pre  to code~/.inputrc/code.  <answer218639> Go to iTerm Preferences → Profiles, select your profile, then the Keys tab. Click Load Preset... and choose Natural Text Editing.  <answer226005> CMD+Delete -- Send Hex Code -- 0x15  To delete the whole line (similar to Option+U)  <answer243384> ol liGo to: strongPreferences/strong  strongProfiles/strong  strongKeys/strong /li liLook for the actions of ⌥← and  ⌥→. They would have been mapped to: strongSend Hex codes/strong /li liChange them to strongSend Escape sequence/strong with kbdEsc/kbd+kbdB/kbd for backward and kbdEsc/kbd+kbdF/kbd for forward./li /ol  <comment162560> It doesn't work for me http://derp.co.uk/9a631 <comment162576> @demas Edited, try now? <comment235355> It works, thanks. But what does those escape sequences actually mean? <comment238551> Shouldn't this be default in the OS X version of iTerm by now? <comment292549> This is the correct solution as of latest version. <comment301238> Important: you also need to go to Profiles  Keys and unbind same combinations there! Because this setting in profile is stronger and overrides the keys settings in the original answer. <comment301239> This option is not present in the last Iterm2 v.3.0.3. Under 'Load Preset' I only have factory defaults. <comment301240> This solution is better, than the accepted answer due to the reasons I've put in a comment on the latter. <comment303152> This worked best for me. Trying to set it up in iTerm2 only generated `[D` or `[C` each time I tried to use the new button action. Thank you. <comment312740> "Natural Text Editing" is available under Profile  Keys as a preset, but not under the global Keys settings. <comment318501> As far as I can tell there's nothing you can do in iTerm2 v3.0.10. It has to be this bash setup. <comment330542> For some reason I don't know. This doesn't work for me, still getting the strange symbols. Thanks though <comment343590> Not sure about `iTerm2 v3.0.10`, but `iTerm2 v3.0.14` definitely works with the `Natural Text Editing` solution so you don't need to resort to bash input configuration. <comment356565> @Innokenty The screenshot (edited into my answer by another user) does not follow the steps I describe in the words above it (written by me), the latter of which match what you suggest <comment362779> @Innokenty, thank you for this detail! In Preferences-Keys, I had ⌥← and ⌥→  set to the right thing (e.g. the send escape sequence, esc+f), but in Preferences-Profiles-Keys they were set to the wrong thing (something about sending hex codes). Removing the ones in Preferences-Profiles-Keys helped <comment364136> This is a much better answer for newer versions. Thank you!
