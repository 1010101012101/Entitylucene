iTunes Crash Using LinkTunes <body> Hey guys I know this isn't the right place to ask but didn't know where else to go.    I installed LinkTunes to download music through iTunes.   I also downloaded safaridownloader+ to download songs as well.    I downloaded a song using safaridownloader and imported it using LinkTunes.  Now, when I open iTunes, I go to emDownloads/em and it says 1 song download.  However, once I click on the emDownloads/em tab iTunes crashes.  All help is appreciated.  Thx!!  <comment311235> iTunes strikes me as Apple-related! Have you tried contacting the developers of linktunes or safaridownloader? Support forums for these might be your best bet.
