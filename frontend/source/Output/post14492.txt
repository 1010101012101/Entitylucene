Couldn't locate MessageTracer database (at path /var/log/DiagnosticMessages) <body> Whenever I open "About this Mac"  "More Info..." and navigate to logs there is an entry with the following content. Any idea what I can do about it?     /usr/bin/pmset -g log:      Description: Power Management logs      Size:    77 bytes      Last Modified:   5/19/11 11:26 PM      Recent Contents: Couldn't locate MessageTracer database (at path /var/log/DiagnosticMessages)   I am on a MBP with OS X 10.6.7  TIA  <comment17912> Are you logged in on a non-administrator account? <comment17935> @Bas I coudn't see any difference even if I logged in as an admin user. <comment17985> Do you get any result when you do "sudo pmset -g log" on the command line?
