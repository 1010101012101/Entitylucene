How to view permissions number of file within Terminal? <body> So I want to view the permissions number that a particular file has within Terminal. For example, if I'm in a directory with a codereadme.txt/code file, and do codels -l/code, something like this would output:  code-rwxrwxrwx   1 username  DOMAIN\Domain Users  613 Mar 16 14:56 readme.txt/code  But if I run codesudo chmod -R 777 readme.txt/code, is there a command I can run to view the permissions number of codereadme.txt/code? The output I expect is code777/code.  Thank you.  <comment348089> Have a llok at these. answers- http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/248263/is-it-possible-to-change-the-way-terminal-displays-files-permission/248291#248291
