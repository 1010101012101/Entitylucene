Imac 20 inch 2009 OSX 10.9.5 <body> I have an issue with Mac App store not opening - probably due to using Clean My Mac which has now been trashed!  Is there any way I can download a new OS without using App Store - the iMac does;t have a restore disk or partition!   Cheeers  Ian  <answer147532> You can try the following commands to fix that.  ol liOpen the Terminal application (located in /Applications/Utilities)/li liType in the following commands:  codesudo rm ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.appstore.plist/code  codesudo rm ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.storeagent.plist/code/li liType in your password when prompted, (your password won't appear when you type it, this is perfectly normal)./li /ol  Now the Mac App Store should work again.   <comment173906> Is there an error when you try to open the store? Or does the store simply not open? <comment174461> What if terminal won't even open? Mine does the same thing. All the apps come up on the tray and disappear immediately.
