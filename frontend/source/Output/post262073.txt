Keychain is locked remotely after certificate updating <body> We have a cross-platform Xamarin application. iOS version is build remotely on Mac mini with El Capitan via SSH. We used to codesign our compiled application with Developer certificate.  precode/usr/bin/codesign --force -s "iPhone Developer: John Doe" /path/to/app /code/pre  It used to work fine, but the certificate has recently expired. After deleting the old and importing the new ones, codesign started to fail with codeUser interaction is not allowed/code message. codesecurity show-keychain-info ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain/code also started to print the same error message. However when we type the same commands directly in terminal on Mac, it works fine. If I codesecurity unlock-keychain -p password ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain/code before codesign, everything works well, but it is very strange because login.keychain is always unlocked on Mac. I want to understand what has happened with keychain and how to restore the previous behavior
