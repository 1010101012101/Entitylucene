Desktop Mac Extremely Hot Running as External Display <body> I have a late 2009 iMac that I use as an external display for my mid 2014 Macbook pro. Everything works great except the iMac runs extremely hot to the touch, close to burning if you had your hand there long enough.  I know that the iMac itself is still running its CPU and everything underneath, wondering if there is a way to just run it as an external display without it getting so hot. Concerned of possible fire dangers or just ruining the iMac.
