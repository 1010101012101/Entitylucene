10.11.2: QuickLook and thumbnails crashing finder <body> I have a strange problem: Finder crashes ("not responding") after performing one of these:  ul lipressing codespace/code on a file that can be previewed with QuickLook, e.g. a sound file or an image/li lisimply selecting a file that can be previewed with QuickLook when the finder displays the instant QuickLook pane/li /ul  Also, all my thumbnails are not displayed. All files are shown with their file type icon and not with a preview icon.   Any ideas? I have already removed Flip4Mac in code~/Library/Containers/QuickTime/code to make sure no third party module is responsible for this.   <answer224680> I was able to solve it:  codesudo /usr/libexec/repair_packages --repair --standard-pkgs //code  did repair the access rights of the folder code/private/tmp/code. I suspect that Adobe Creative Cloud has altered the rights.   There have been some log lines in the console about quicklookd being not able to scan /, so that is another symptom of that problem.
