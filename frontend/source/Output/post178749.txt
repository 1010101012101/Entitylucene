The "Open" and "Save" system dialogs get taller every time I open them <body> I'm using Mac OS 10.10.2, and I believe this problem only occurs with Mac OS X Yosemite.  Here is the dialog box I am talking about:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/T2lfi.png" alt="Dialog box"  I just pressed codeCmd+S/code on Ask Different to trigger this dialog.  If I were to close this dialog, and press codeCmd+S/code again, this dialog will grow taller, by about 100 pixels, I'd say.  What is causing this? This actually is emreally/em annoying, as I find myself opening this dialog upwards of 30-40 times a normal work day, causing the dialog to frequently go off the screen, causing inconvenience in saving the files and similar operations.  Is there a way to fix this? I'm not really looking for a fix - I just want this bug to be recorded here, in the event of there being a fix in Mac OS X in the future (only after I upgraded to Yosemite, this started happening).  <answer178789> This is a common and known bug. Just google "Save Dialog Grows" to see.  Hopefully Apple will fix it with the next point release.  <comment211811> Not at a fix, but a workaround that allows resizing the panel once it has grown too big to grab the bottom border: grab a side border, hold the shift key and drag. The panel will resize in both dimensions. <comment211924> haha - I was searching by the terms "dialog windows keep getting taller" - couldn't find anything! great to know people have heard about this problem!
