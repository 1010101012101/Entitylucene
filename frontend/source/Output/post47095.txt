How to search by image from the iPad? <body> Google only allows image search from the camera directly (and not the gallery), but doesn't allow iPad users to search by uploading an existing image or typing a specific URL.   How can I search by image from an iPad?  <answer48029> When you're on the Google Images page scroll all the way to the bottom. There is a choice there to use either Google Tablet or Classic (defaults to tablet on the iPad). Click on classic and you should get the same options as on your mac/pc.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/x269f.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer87348> Use the Google Chrome app for iOS.  ol liBrowse to Google Images/li liTap the menu button in the top right corner at the end of the address bar (looks like three horizontal bars stacked on top of each other)./li liTap "Request desktop site".
