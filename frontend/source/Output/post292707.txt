How do I make my Apple ID sign in request silent? <body> Every time I sign in iCloud I receive in iPad a notification to allow login. Thats ok!  What's not okay is that sound so loud. How do I make it elegantly silent?  <answer292720> The two-factor authentication alert follows the volume of codeRinger and Alerts/code. It can be adjusted via the hardware volume buttons, although you may have disabled that functionality.  If that is the case, head into strongSettings/strong → strongSounds/strong and adjust the slider for codeRinger and Alerts/code. This will affect the volume of all notifications (including FaceTime call notifications).  If you want to completely silence those alerts, you can:  ul liDrag the slider all the way down./li liUse your iPad’s hardware strongmute switch/strong (removed starting with iPad Air 2, iPad mini 4, iPad Pro and iPad 5)./li liPull up the strongControl Center/strong and emenable/em the crossed-out bell icon./li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2iEwJ.jpg" width="500"  <comment369377> Would it be possible to silent just the Apple ID sign in request? <comment369379> Unfortunately no. There is no separate setting for this under **Notifications**. <comment369381> I'll vote to have such an option. <comment369382> And a side question... the 2fa alert also appears on my mbp, may I remove them from mbp? <comment369383> I believe you can, but I'm not near my Mac to check how this would work. You'd be better off asking this in a separate Question for greater visibility. <comment369389> Good ideia... https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/292781/the-2fa-alert-also-appears-on-my-mbp-may-i-remove-it-from-mbp
