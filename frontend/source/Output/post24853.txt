Create audiobook from mp3 files? <body> How do I transfer a folder containing mp3 files to my iPod/iTunes to be recognized as an audiobook?  <answer24857> I use iTunes 10 in Windows 7.  ol liSelect the tracks./li liRight-click and select strongGet Info/strong./li liOpen the strongOptions/strong tab./li liSet:br Equilizer Preset = Spoken Wordbr Media Kind = Audiobookbr Part of a compilation = Nobr Remember position = Yesbr Skip when shuffling = Yesbr Gapless album = No/li liPress strongOK/strong./li /ol  Also, make sure the correct track numbers and disc numbers are set for each track.  <answer27567> I used to do the method that Hand-E-Food used. It works fine, but you still end up with a ton of individual mp3 files. This was a pain for me because of the way they showed up when I plug them into my car stereo.   After a bunch of looking around, I found AudioBook Builder. It takes all the mp3 files and converts them into a single .m4b audiobook file. Assuming you are on a Mac, it's worth a look.  The app is available directly in the App Store. I've only used it a few times, but that's only because I don't have that many audio books. It was quick and easy and more than worth the price for the hassle it saved me.   <comment40656> What do "Part of a compilation" and "Gapless album" mean? <comment40836> I'm not entirely sure.  I think a compelation is like an album where every song is by a different artist (eg. *The Best Hits of 2000*).  A gapless album might be where the tracks are mixed together so there's no silence throughout the album, like many dance music albums.  I don't know how they affect iTunes.
