Why does Gmail and Google Docs use up so much RAM on macOS? <body> I've always noticed that Gmail and Google Docs will take up ~1GB of RAM at any time if you have open in Safari. However, something odd happened to me just a while ago: I had a Google Docs tab open for a while, and out of nowhere it started using 8GB of RAM. Most of it had been compressed, but my memory pressure was quite high.  Is there any reason that these Google sites use up so much RAM? Should I be worried at all about this, especially if for some reason Docs starts using 8GB?
