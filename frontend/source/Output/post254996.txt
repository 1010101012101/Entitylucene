Applescript System Event prompts for admin password, when given does not operate correctly. <body> I am attempting to create an Applescript for a computer lab which will quickly change a few system preference settings primarily in Security &amp; Privacy. An example of one command is:  precodetell security preferences     set log out when inactive to true     get log out when inactive end tell /code/pre  When this is run, it brings up a prompt for an admin password as expected since this option can only be accessed via the GUI after unlocking in System Preferences anyway. The issue is that when using a correct admin username and password, the set never changes, so the get gives whatever the value was already set to. In the case of my example, the check box is not checked, so the value returned is always false unless I manually check it first.  So my question boils down to: Is there a reason why it seems the prompt "System Events is trying to unlock Security &amp; Privacy preferences" does NOT actually unlock it?  <comment317570> What version of macOS? <comment317571> Ah sorry, that would be helpful to mention. I'm running El Capitan.
