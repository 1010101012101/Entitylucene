New MacBook Pro SSH problems <body> So, I'm having a very annoying problem with my new MacBook. I have a Raspberry Pi which I regularly have to SSH into. I have never had any problems connecting to it with my old MacBook (MD101), but since I got my new one, I don't seem to be able to connect. I can see the Pi on the network (when running codearp -a/code for example), and I can SSH into it using other computers, just not the new laptop. Sometimes I get to the login prompt, but as soon as I successfully log in, I get a broken pipe exception.  I have also been able to SSH into other devices from the MacBook, just not the PI. I have tried resetting my network settings on both devices, disabling the firewall and everything else I could think of, without any success. Any help would be appreciated!  EDIT: verbose ssh output is:  precodeOpenSSH_7.4p1, LibreSSL 2.5.0 debug1: Reading configuration data /etc/ssh/ssh_config debug1: Connecting to 192.168.178.33 [192.168.178.33] port 22. debug1: Connection established. debug1: identity file /Users/user/.ssh/id_rsa type 1 debug1: key_load_public: No such file or directory debug1: identity file /Users/user/.ssh/id_rsa-cert type -1 debug1: key_load_public: No such file or directory debug1: identity file /Users/user/.ssh/id_dsa type -1 debug1: key_load_public: No such file or directory debug1: identity file /Users/user/.ssh/id_dsa-cert type -1 debug1: key_load_public: No such file or directory debug1: identity file /Users/user/.ssh/id_ecdsa type -1 debug1: key_load_public: No such file or directory debug1: identity file /Users/user/.ssh/id_ecdsa-cert type -1 debug1: key_load_public: No such file or directory debug1: identity file /Users/user/.ssh/id_ed25519 type -1 debug1: key_load_public: No such file or directory debug1: identity file /Users/user/.ssh/id_ed25519-cert type -1 debug1: Enabling compatibility mode for protocol 2.0 debug1: Local version string SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_7.4 ssh_exchange_identification: read: Operation timed out /code/pre  EDIT2: Forgot to mention that I am also unable to ping the Raspberry Pi from the laptop, but I am able to ping it from other machines and vice versa  <comment362709> Try using the verbose option on ssh - `ssh -v user@host` and post the messages to your original question. <comment362717> I think this has to do with SSH1 being disabled on macOS Sierra (OpenSSH v7.x).  See this answer:  https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/255621/119271 <comment362721> Unfortunately it doesn't look like any of the links on that page seem to be working. Or am I just doing something wrong? <comment362724> just checked two random links and they work... <comment362727> The patch seems to fail on my machine: `1 out of 3 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file /usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Taps/homebrew/homebrew-core/Formula/openssh.rb.rej` <comment362741> Unfortunately, I can't replicate to assist (which is why I won't post as an answer).  I won't install Sierra because it creates more problems than it solves.
