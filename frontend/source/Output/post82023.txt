Find My Mac while the machine is sleeping and no known networks? <body> If my 2012 Macbook is in sleep mode in a place where it does not know any Wifi networks (but there are unsecured SSIDs in range), will Find My Mac be able to locate it or perform any actions?  Or more generally, is it technically possible, given the Wifi hardware, to remote-wakeup a Macbook OR get information about its geolocation just by being in the presence of unsecured SSIDs?  Or does one need to manually connect it to an SSID first?
