Set up a Mac to run OSX (None Browser) application in pure kiosk mode <body> I've been trying for a number of months, using many methods, to run a Nuiteq Application called Snowflake on our 10 Mac Minis attached to touch-screens in pure Kiosk mode. I'm using Yosemite. These machines must be able to:  ol liRun full windowless screens/li liHave the Dock and Menu Bar disabled/li liAccess to finder removed/li liNot show the default cursor, and only use multitouch functionality in Snowflake/li /ol  Unfortunately, I don't have build access to the application, and can't add things like codeNSApplicationPresentationHideMenuBar/codeto Snowflake as it is proprietary software.  Initially I began by adding codeLUSIPresentationMode/code to the info.plist file of the app, with some success. The dock and menu bar was still appearing. Then I created a plist in code~/Library/LaunchAgents//code that replaced finder with the app. It looked like this:  precode &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;POSIXSpawnType&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;App&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;key&gt;RunAtLoad&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;true/&gt;     &lt;key&gt;KeepAlive&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;dict&gt;         &lt;key&gt;SuccessfulExit&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;true/&gt;         &lt;key&gt;AfterInitialDemand&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;false/&gt;     &lt;/dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;com.apple.FindertoSnowflake&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Program&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;/Applications/snowflake/run.sh&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;key&gt;CFBundleIdentifier&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;com.apple.finder&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;key&gt;ThrottleInterval&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;integer&gt;0&lt;/integer&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  and I wrote 2 short scripts that loaded and unloaded the plist to stop/start the app. (The following is to start it)  precodePASSWORD=password  echo $PASSWORD | sudo -S killall Finder launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.Finder.plist launchctl load -w /Users/snowbloke/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.FindertoSnowflake.plist /code/pre  And this to stop:  precodePASSWORD=password  echo $PASSWORD | sudo -S killall -vu snowflake /code/pre  And then, the software wouldn't hide the main cursor so I had to write in a keyboard emulation of Fn+F3 to the start the script. Otherwise there would have been 2 sets of interaction going on between the touch drivers used by Snowflake and the OS. This was very annoying.  precodeosascript -e "tell application \"System Events\" to key code 99"  exit 0 /code/pre  Each mac logs straight into the app from start up.  After doing all of this and running tests over time, the users are strongstill/strong able to get into the OS desktop and finder just starts running. For some reason either the menu bar or dock turn up on screen. strongIs there a more robust solution? What am I doing wrong?/strong  <comment294902> Can anyone give me an answer? Does El Capitan provide a better solution?
