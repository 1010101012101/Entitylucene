Google Street View not working on the new iPad (3rd generation iPad) <body> Trying to use the Google Street View in Safari is crashing in the new iPad. Here's a link for reference: http://maps.google.com/help/maps/streetview/mobile/gallery.html#!/id=258  The same thing works fine in iPad 2. Has anyone faced similar problems? Is there something I can do to fix this issue?  <answer51865> No need to bother Safari for this. Just use the "Maps"-app for it!  Open the app, navigate to your address and tap on the red pin.     To activate Street View, toggle the little red guy.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lu86V.jpg" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hnfXg.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment59283> What is your question?
