iPhone/iPad alarm clock app with custom radio stream support <body> Is there a iPhone (or even better iPad) alarm clock app that will play a radio stream of my choosing to wake me up?  With custom stream I mean the possibility to enter a custom URL to a .pls file, and that pls contains a URL to a mp3.  Something like TimeTurner but with the custom stream support.  <answer3805> Radio Alarm is a great iPhone app that works well with custom streams (.pls file that points to a MP3) and has a lot of well working alarm features.  <answer3806> Tunemark Radio is a iPad/iPhone app that support custom streams (.pls file that points to a MP3), but isn't really written to work as a alarm clock so has poor alarm features.  <answer35117> TuneIn Radio. I've not looked back since.  <answer261467> Update 2016 (post iOS 8.0):  Bedr radio alarm clock, which is able to run in a background state.   <comment40043> Welcome to Ask Different! Can you tell us more about this app? What makes it special, and why do you like it? Please take a look at the [FAQs](http://apple.stackexchange.com/faq) for more info. Thanks. <comment96773> It's good, but the iPhone app at least doesn't seem to have an alarm function.
