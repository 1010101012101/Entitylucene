Dell P2715Q 4k at 60Hz with Mid 2015 MacBook Pro? <body> Can I run a Dell P2715Q as an external display to my MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015) at full 4k resolution (3840 x 2160 Pixel) and 60Hz?  If I understand the spec page for the Mac correctly, it won't work over HDMI, only at 30Hz.  But will it work if I connect the display via a mini-displayport-to-displayport cable?  I have also read this article, but I can't seem to parse the required info from it.  <comment372572> I don't see how this is the same question as the linked "dupe", but the short answer is that yes, using mDP, you should be able to get full 4K at 60Hz
