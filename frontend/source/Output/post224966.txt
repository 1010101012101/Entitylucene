Cannot access Boot Camp partition after OS X reinstall <body> I've already used Boot Camp to install Windows on my computer. A while back I had to erase my hard drive and reinstall Mavericks. Once I did that my Windows portion still exist as a volume, but when I got to my Start Up Disk settings it's a folder and not a disk.   I have a lot of my music I created with sound effects and sound kits in FL Studios on that side I don't want to lose.   Do I have to erase and reinstall Windows using Boot Camp or can I fix that issue by creating another bootable disk for my Windows?   <answer224973> Neither of the suggested proposals is advisable. If you erase and reinstall Windows all the music will be lost. Creating a second bootable disk is a complex and error-prone task.  If the Windows volume really still exists you can access it in read-only mode and save your music to the OS X volume by default. If you also need write access install an appropriate tool like NTFS for Mac 14 or a free tool like NTFS-3G for Mac OS X.  You may also salvage the bootability of the Windows partition by adding appropriate MBR entries.

What can do in order for that to work? <comment273011> @Rayne82 Would you mind opening Terminal.app and entering `sudo gpt -r show /dev/disk0` and `sudo fdisk /dev/disk0`?. You have to enter your admin password after executing `sudo + some command`! Please add the results to your question by editing it. This shows the partition map - just to check if the Windows partition is still there. <comment273162> It is suppose to be a folder icon for Windows! OS X appears as a disk icon. What you see is correct. Did you select the windows icon follow by a restart? If windows does not boot, you may have to rebuild the BCD file on the windows volume. This generally can be done by booting from the windows install media. <comment273166> chakitathomas$ sudo gpt-r show/dev/disk0 sudofdisk/dev/disk0  WARNING: Improper use of the sudo command could lead to data loss or the deletion of important system files.

You just have to copy and paste the content of the grey boxes in my first comment. <comment273374> chakitathomas$ sudo gpt -r show/dev/disk0 sudufdisk0/dev/disk0 sudo+some command Password: gpt: unknown command: show/dev/disk0 chakitas-imac:~ chakitathomas$  --  I still have no clue what I'm doing. <comment273380> @Rayne82 You are reading the partition table of your main disk. But you still don't enter the commands properly: I didn't write `sudo gpt -r show/dev/disk0` or `sudo gpt-r show/dev/disk0` but `sudo gpt -r show /dev/disk0`
