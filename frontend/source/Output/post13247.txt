Is there a utility that allows to open a terminal window with a shortcut? <body> I often use the Terminal application, especially to commit code to a Git repository, and I don't want to have the window always open. Is there a utility that allows to open a terminal window using a shortcut?  <answer13250> Visor does that: http://visor.binaryage.com/  In case you just want a command line, use: http://decimus.net/DTerm/  <answer13251> Check out iTerm2 (see also the Google project page). You can bind a key combination as a way to show/hide the terminal. In a way, you achieve the same thing as the before mentioned Visor; yet, iTerm2 offers more functionality than Terminal.app.   Combine this with alfred/quicksilver and iTerm2 profiles for more hotkey awesomeness.  <answer13253> DTerm may be exactly what you are after: it's like a file location aware terminal that pops in and out of view. So you can activate it while you've got a file selected in terminal (or XCode, or whatever) and take an action on the file (like commit a change) and then it gets out your way.  It's free and also available on the Mac App Store.  <answer13257> Use Quicksilver! You can setup hot-keys for launching apps. Plus it does a bunch of other neat things :)  <answer13298> Alfred is a wonderful Quicksilver-like app that can do this, providing that you purchase the PowerPack.  I use this quite frequently; I just bring up the window and type code&gt; cd ~/Developer/code and then hit kbdreturn/kbd.  <answer13305> I like apptivate, it ain't free.. but it's superfast (unlike visor eg)! It works for any app, plus you get a empeek/em option, alowing you to peek into the shortcutted app.  <answer13527> I just press Apple and space to bring up spotlight  Followed by typing 'te' which finds terminal and then hit return.   <comment13982> are you asking if there is a utility that opens a terminal window and then closes it after your done? cause technically "Terminal" does what your asking <comment13983> @luca590 I am asking for an application that opens a terminal window with a shortcut; I can reset my Mac, but I want to still be able to open a terminal window with a shortcut. <comment13984> you can copy terminal and paste it to your desktop or where ever you feel necessary if that is sufficient
