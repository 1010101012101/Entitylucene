MacBook Air is slow after inserted and removed USB audio player <body> I have a first generation MacBook Air.  I plugged in a USB memory stick, which is actually a 2 GB MP3 player but serves as a memory stick as well. Finder never shows the content of the memory stick. It will show the content of a USB drive I've got. It did complain when I unplugged it the first time ("unplug it correctly" or similar).  I disconnected the USB stick after that, although I have connected it again a few times just to see if unplugging it correctly solves anything.  After that my MacBook Air is very, very slow. I have restarted it at least ten times. It takes 30 minutes before showing the login screen, unless I boot it in safe mode, then it boots at normal speed.  However, regardless of how I boot it, it is still very, very slow when running apps. It takes 10 minutes to show a Finder window. It takes two minutes to show the left-most drop-down apple-menu (with the sleep/shutdown options).  I had Rapport installed, but removed it. I though I had Avast Anti-virus installed, but I don't. (Could it be that it uninstalled itself?)  I want it back at full speed. What do I do now?  <comment133371> I spoke to Apple Support and they said to upgrade to Mavericks and get 90 days free support. I'll do that and report back.
