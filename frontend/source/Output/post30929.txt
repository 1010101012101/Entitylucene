Installing OS X 10.5.8 over existing 10.4.11 <body> My iBook G4 has OS X 10.4.11, it needs 10.5.8 or higher to run the external hard drive I recently purchased. I was not aware of this until many unsuccessful attempts to get the thing to work and I read the fine print on the box.  The guy at Staples said to just hook it up and there would be "Prompts" to get it going. I now believe he knew about as much as I did about this product! Really need the storage space for about 4000 photos, music, etc. Please advise.  <answer30940> If you want to upgrade your iBook G4 to 10.5, then you need a install CD. Obviously it is no longer sold by Apple, therefore you need to find someone in your entourage who has a disk, or maybe look on Craig's list for someone who might have one to sell or give away.  Then upgrading to 10.5.8 will simply be a matter of running software update.  The tricky part will be finding a disk, or an image of a disk that you could burn onto a CD/DVD.  And just to be sure you are aware of this: 10.5.8 will be the most recent OS you will be able to install on your iBook, since Snow Leopard and later is Intel only. :-)  <comment35518> What exactly is your question here? "Where do I get OSX 10.5 from", "I have 10.5 on a DVD, what do I have to consider before upgrading", or something else? And just out of curiosity: What kind of hard drive are we talking about here? <comment35544> In its current form, there is really no question here. Feel free to clarify using the `edit` link under your question. If you do, I'll be happy to reopen this. Please take a look at the [FAQs](http://apple.stackexchange.com/faq) for more info. Thanks.
