Option-Left/Right Arrow doesn't work <body> The keyboard shortcuts Option-Left/Right Arrow is made for moving the cursor by words, as Apple described here: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201236 , but doesn't work on my MacBook Pro (15-inch, Mid 2010, OS X 10.11). They fail to work everywhere I can try, including but not limited to Notes, TextEdit, Mail, Google.com search field and iMessage text field. Meanwhile on my friend's MacBook Air (13-inch, Mid 2013, OS X 10.11), they work damn well! Anyone can help?  Note:   ol liAn Apple Wireless Keyboard is paired to my Mac, but it doesn't help./li liSystem has been restarted several times, doesn't help./li liIncluding Option-Delete and Option-Shift-Up Arrow, all the Option related shortcuts in the "Document shortcuts" session of https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201236 doesn't work./li liThe Option key is fine, I have tested it by shortcuts like Command-Optiono-H which works./li /ol  <answer219229> The problem has been solved by switching the input source from "Unicode Hex Input" (my major input source) to "U.S.". I think some option based shortcuts can't function as usual with "Unicode Hex Input".  <answer272446> Another problem here can pop up if you have a gaming keyboard.  I have a codeg/pc/code button that is activated by codefn + f12/code that turns this off.  I always forget about it and then remember when I visit this link, so dropping it in for next time :)
