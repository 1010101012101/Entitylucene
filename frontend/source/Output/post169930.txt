Yosemite - Finder has a disconnect button when attached to OSX Server, not working <body> You can endlessly click disconnect, but you are never disconnected.  On the OSX Server (Yosemite Server.app 4.0.2), you can see your user account still connected, on the client (Yosemite 10.10.1) the finder still shows the folders and the disconnect button.  Any ideas?  <answer190619> In the Finder, select the "Go" menu  "Connect to Server...", then click on the Recent Servers menu button (button with tiny clock, to the right of the "+" button) and select "Clear Recent Servers".  Now go to a Finder window, select the server from the list and click on the Disconnect button and the server will be disconnected.  (OS 10.10.3)  <comment234350> 10.10.3 here, doesn't work :(
