When launching java app as Mac app there default java process name and About description instead of mine <body> I have a number of jar-files, some resources, h2 database, etc. in my project. To create strongMac application/strong I used Platypus. To run my application strongshell script/strong was used.   However at this case when application starts then strongseparate java process/strong starts and there strongneither proper name of the app nor proper Abou/strongt description in Mac menu. Also Terminal starts that is not wanted.  How I should launch the app to avoid this drawbacks so that the name of the app and About description were the right ones?

The process is simple: I set my shell-script and add all my resources. Also I can set up the icon. And I add Credits.html to allow About description as said in documentation:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FCxGh.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer296178> If you use a shell script you must run it from a shell and so to ghet a shell macOS opens Terminal. You are also not running an app so not getting the correct setup for icons, menus etc.  To be seen as an app the executable needs to be packaged as per Apple's Bundle documentation  This Platypus seems to say it should do this. So in this case you need to read its documentation and see what you have not done. If this is the problem then this would need to be a question on StackOverflow but you would need to show how you set your app up.  <comment374069> Thanks for your advice. I have read this article but it is hard for me to understand how to transform launching process from shell-script to Apple bundle.
