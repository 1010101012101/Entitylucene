Adding a Second IP Address to an Existing Network Adapter <body> On linux boxes it is possible to add multiple ip addresses to the same network interface.  It's achived with the following command:  precodeip addr add 128.133.123.83/24 dev eth0 /code/pre  Is there any way to to the same with OS X ?   I've tried to put multiple ip addresses (comma separated like the dns) in System Preferences / Network with no luck...  <answer911> Yeah, it's pretty easy. Open the System Preferences, go to Networking, then click the Plus sign under the left bar. Choose the interface, give a name to the adapter configuration you're creating, then press OK and deal with it as you would like to. Click Apply when you're done, and enjoy. Your adapter now has two IP addresses.  <answer238715> codesudo ifconfig en0 alias 128.133.123.83/24 up/code  <comment279222> How can it make it work with a browser? I mean, I can ping or telnet using the new address, but I can't connect using the browser... <comment279254> You can reorder adapters in order of preference by dragging and dropping them.
