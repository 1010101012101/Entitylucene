Password only after closing clamshell - is this possible? <body> I want my macbook air to require the password prompt only after closing the clamshell lid, not once it goes to sleep/screensaver. I like to leave the lid open for quick reference, but have screen saver on (at 5 minutes) to reduce power/battery consumption.  I haven't been able to see in OS where/if this is an available setting. Macbook Air - mid 2012 OS X El Capitan - version 10.11.2 Any help would be much appreciated.  Thanks!  <comment320198> Possible duplicate of [MacBook Air: Close lid and lock features](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/65603/macbook-air-close-lid-and-lock-features) <comment320232> @fsb Pretty sure that question is the opposite of this one. <comment320238> @timothymh The question might be but take a look at the accepted answer and see if that addresses the OPs question.  I thought it did but another set of eyes couldn't hurt.
