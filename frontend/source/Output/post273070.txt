Apple Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 and Thunderbolt Display <body> I just bought this Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter  for my new MacBook Pro (2016) to connect it to my old Thunderbolt Display, but realized that none of my USB ports or Thunderbolt port work (so no daisy-chaining).  Is it something wrong with my setup or is this connectivity not supported by Apple's official Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to Thunderbolt 2 solution?  This does not sound like "to Thunderbolt 2" adapter to me, since it only supports multimedia.  <answer273131> Connecting 2 Thunderbolt displays using daisy chain with the Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to Thunderbolt 2 didn't work for me until I upgraded to the latest Sierra build. (10.12.13) now everything is working as it should. If upgrading didn't work for you I suggest that the adapter is faulty.   <comment343292> What model is your _old Thunderbolt display_? And what do you mean by _but realized that none of my USB ports or Thunderbolts port work_? Just to clarify, does your display work with this cable? If so, what is it that you're trying to do that isn't working? <comment343321> My Thunderbolt Display is from 2012. I just realized that USB/Thunderbolt ports work when I plug the cable off and then plug it on back again, but it works only for ten of minutes and then it stops working. I have to plug it off and on again. I am merely using USB keyboard in my Display and Wacom Tablet so this is really an inconvenience. <comment343817> Tried the update and everything works properly now. <comment361915> What about the ethernet slot in the display? Is it recognised by the mac? <comment361922> Yes. Works fine.
