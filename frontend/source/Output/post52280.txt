Making MAMP site accessible externally <body> ul liI've set up port forwarding on both Netgear DGN2000 router and airport extreme base station./li liI've checked with Network Utility that the port 8888 is open./li liYet I don't seem to be able to make the (Wordpress) site accessible externally (according to client)./li liAlso, is there a good way to check this myself from home, apart from using the browser on my phone on 3G?/li /ul  <comment59818> Which port is MAMP listening on, and how did you forward the port on your router? Are you browsing to your public IP address or resolving a (DynDNS) hostname? <comment59858> MAMP is listening on 8888 I think, and i configured the router by adding MAMP as a service and allowed set a firewall rule to allow it. I'm browsing to a static IP address not DynDNS. <comment59867> Can you see your site when browsing to http://127.0.0.1:8888 ? <comment59874> No, I can't. I am completely bewildered about how to configure - router - airport base station - host machine's network settings - MAMP - wordpress general settings. <comment59875> Then MAMP is not listening on port 8888. Check your config. <comment59881> Which config should I be looking aat?  Mamp?  Airport?  Wordpress? Network?  Sorry... I am totally confused here. <comment59892> First MAMP, you need to know which port it is listening on. Then in your router you need to forward a port (any would do) to the IP address of your computer and the port on which MAMP is listening. <comment59894> @Gerry OK did that.  Should I have a static IP address for the machine hosting the server? Do I need to configure the airport base station?  The IPv4 or IPv6 settings for the network? Firewalls?  Also, thanks for your interest. I am aware that this discussion should be in a chat but I don't have enough reputation to transfer it...
