limited "where" options when saving Word document using OSX El Capitan <body> Currently using OSX version 10.11.3.  Prior to downloading El Capitan I had all the options that I'd see on the  Finder side bar when I wanted to save a document. see screen shot: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/q9kSd.png" alt="Finder Menu" and I could drill into sub folders which allowed me to be very specific to where I saved documents.  I now have a very limited number of options and I cant drill into sub folders see screen shot:.img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jPV7b.png" alt="limited save as menu"   I'd love if someone had a solution.  I went into controll panel but nothing stood out to correct it.  <answer226261> Click the little down arrow next to the 'Save As' field. That will expand your options to show the Finder-like interface and expose extra controls like the checkbox that allows you to suppress hiding the file extension.  <comment274759> This seems to be similar to the issue in that question, please try some of the solutions in there and report back if they don't work. <comment274760> Will do.  Cheers <comment274764> Worked!!!! Victory!!!!   Thankyou
