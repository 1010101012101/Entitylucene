Install macOS Sierra using a newer Mac to be deployed on an older Mac? <body> Any problem with using a newer Mac laptop to install macOS Sierra onto an external hard drive, then install into an older Mac laptop? (assuming both Macs are Sierra-capable, obviously)  Are there any issues with booting and running an older Mac from a macOS created with a newer Mac? For example, does the Sierra installer install drivers specific to the Mac on which the Sierra installer app ran?  <answer294254> This should work fine; the installer will install all drivers needed for all supported Mac models, so you can move drives between models pretty freely.  <comment371434> I found one catch: Apple refuses to run some older macOS installers on some newer Macs.
