I have lost saved passwords does keychain have anything to do with it? <body> in the last few days my password access to files has gone missing and the keychain lists have unidentified inputs such as "handoff-decryption-key-[REDACTED]" Whats going on?  <comment342837> Hi, I edited out the decryption key from your post, which should probably be kept secret. <comment342849> @Faiz That's only the UID, not the actual key, no need for redaction.
