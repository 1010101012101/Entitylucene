I got an image on terminal from the output of homebrew package manager <body> I got a strange image from the output of brew like this img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ESEIQ.png" alt="enter image description here". I'm curious about this behaviour. Is this a feature of brew or the image comes from some special character set? If a character in some character set, I think it can be employed to customise the terminal (prompt, etc.).   Thanks and Best Regards!  <answer77714> That would be an emoji. You can insert them anywhere by clicking Edit  Special Characters  Emoji. The beer one is under the Objects subcategory.img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/buQvx.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment90044> It is a new feature of brew. Not all characters/emojis can be properly printed in a pleasant manner though. Some might not print properly and some might not print at all. I have not gone through all characters.
