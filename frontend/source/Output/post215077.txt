Safari Redirecting http to (non-existent) https <body> Safari forces a redirect to the https version of a site I previously visited via https.  However, the https site no longer works and there is no way to prevent Safari form trying to load it.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fAX5p.png" alt="HTTP redirects to HTTPS"  Here is a related Apple Forums question, Safari keeps redirecting http to https  <answer215099> If the site has previously indicated to Safari that it wishes to always be accessed over HTTPS through HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security), then Safari will always try to redirect to HTTPS.  You can clear the HSTS cache by deleting code~/Library/Cookies/HSTS.plist/code.  Note that Safari does also cache 301 redirects for a while and thus clearing the normal Safari cache may also be necessary.  <answer253926> It seems Safari enters into this mad behaviour when you have accessed localhost using a client side certificate. In my case, one of the projects I work with needs this client side setup and it totally wrecks development for the projects where I can't use http on localhost. The only workaround I have found is to edit code/etc/hosts/code and add an alias for localhost, like so  precode127.0.0.1 localhost /code/pre  Then use I can use http://localhost:3000 to access my project on port 3000 without Safari forcing a https connection.  <comment259780> Is it possible that HSTS was enabled somewhere in the past? <comment259782> @MaxRied That sounds like a good suggestion, I have no way of knowing. For reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security <comment260062> I should start writing answers... <comment325704> @grgarside I tried this multiple times, it's not working anymore <comment352758> "Clearing the normal Safari cache" â€” how, exactly??
