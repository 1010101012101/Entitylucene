Contacts.app Sync with iCloud gives CoreDAVErrorDomain Error 1 <body> I'm completely clueless. The contacts app does not sync with iCould and gives the CoreDAVErrorDomain Error 1.  I have tried deleting the app and do software update. Same thing. I have tried backing up contacts, delete all contacts, sync with iCloud. It downloads the data from iCloud and gives the error again. Not all contacts are updated. I have tried backup contacts from iCloud, delete data from iCloud, delete data from the contacts app. When i load the backup contacts to iCloud it give this error again. Can my data be corrupted? It loads well to iCloud again and it was backed up from iCloud...  I have an iPhone that syncs perfectly to iCloud and would like the MAC contacts to be sync'd with the phone.  Please let me know if I am making this question in the wrong place. I have also looked for an answer first, but could not find one.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rpf5d.png" alt="all the error information i have"  <comment335333> Did you find anything useful yet? <comment335590> I never solved this.
