Don't auto-hide dock on external monitor <body> I have a MacBook Air (mid 2013) running macOS 10.12.3 which is connected to an external monitor. I have my dock set to auto-hide on my MacBook Air screen but I don't want this to happen on my external monitor. Is there any way to do this natively on a mac? Are there software that supports this feature?  hr  EDIT: I don't think this is a duplicate. The solution on the other thread auto-hides the dock on both screens whenever an external monitor is plugged in. I want to auto-hide the dock only on the MacBook Air screen, and not my external display  <comment351141> I've seen your edit and I didn't close the question originally but I still think it's a duplicate. The linked question is definitely about "hiding the dock on the MacBook monitor **only**". Is there something I'm missing? <comment351150> Actually, I think you may be right. The question asks the same thing even though the answers does not suffice <comment351151> There is only one Dock, each monitor doesn't get its own Dock. Therefore there's no such thing as hiding on one and not on the other.
