Get MacBook to say Thank You when plugging in the power cord? <body> I would like to know how can to create an applescript which is executed when I connect the power cord to my MacBook. I would like it to say "Thank You"  <answer186522> This worked for me:  precodeglobal thanks  on run     set thanks to false end run  on idle     set battStatus to do shell script "pmset -g | grep \\*"     if battStatus contains "AC Power" then         if thanks is false then             say "thank you"             set thanks to true         end if     else         set thanks to false     end if     return 1 end idle /code/pre  Open Script Editor, Save as Application, Check "Stay open after run handler" to keep the program running. The only downside is you'll have to keep this program open at all times. You can set it to launch when you login. Maybe someone else has a better way to address this.  <comment220181> Do You know Cocoa/Carbon? You can easily change this code for what You need: http://context-macosx.googlecode.com/svn-history/r152/trunk/Tools/Applications/Pennyworth/PowerObserver.m If not, let me know I'll post my code on github. <comment220215> Isn't this going to consume a lot of CPU while running? <comment220222> Not really. Its seems to be around 0.1% - less than a lot of background services. <comment220225> OK so it's fine :)
