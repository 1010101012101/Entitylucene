Can I sync my Safari reading with Windows 8.1 although Safari for Windows is no longer available? <body> Currently I am using a Mac and an iPhone and I am syncing the reading list between these two devices successfully.   I read here it is possible to sync the reading list with Windows OS, too. Is this still possible, although Safari for Windows is no longer available?
