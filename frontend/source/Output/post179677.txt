Skype is using 60% to 80% CPU <body> I have a Mid-2014 15" MacBook Pro with an Nvidia graphics card.  Skype uses around 60% - 80% CPU on my computer when I make a call (doesn't matter if it is video or voice call).  I tried doing SMC and PRAM resets with no avail. What could be the cause? And what would you suggest I do to fix it?  <comment213147> Is your MacBook running on batteries or AC power when you have these issues, or doesn't it make a difference? <comment213148> Skype with or without skype video <comment213149> @ScunnerDarkly it is running on AC power. <comment213150> @Buscar웃 Skype with video. <comment213151> Thanks for clarifying, so you have 2 videos going on at same time. What is Skype CPU in idle mode (I have 6%) <comment213152> @Buscar웃, it is using 3% on idle. It goes up to 60%-70% after initiating a video call. <comment213154> I tried now, and it is slow even when it's just a voice call. I checked Skype on my girlfriend's MacBook Air, and it is running on around 8% CPU under same conditions, while my MacBook Pro gets 60% to 80% CPU usage.
