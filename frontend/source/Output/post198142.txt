AppleScript: Get list of 15 most recent files in directory <body> I need to build a string containing the filenames of the 15 most recent files (by modification date) within a directory. Delimited only by a space:  codefile1.jpg file2.jpg file3.jpg/code  I'm using ImageMagick via command line. Here is what I currently have, but get an error number -1728:  precodetell application "Finder"     set imageItems to every file of folder wallpaperPath     set imageItems to the reverse of (sort imageItems by modification date)     set concatFiles to ""     repeat with n from 1 to 15         set imageItem to item n of imageItems         set imageName to the file name of imageItem         set concatFiles to concatFiles &amp; " " &amp; imageName     end repeat end tell do shell script "cd " &amp; wallpaperPath &amp; "; montage " &amp; concatFiles &amp; " -tile 3x5 -geometry 500x500+1+1 ~/Desktop/final.jpg" /code/pre  <answer199081> Change the line,  precode    set imageName to the file name of imageItem /code/pre  to   precode    set imageName to the name of imageItem /code/pre  and it should work.  EDIT:  Couldn't help but notice that you are not quoting your file names. If any of them contain spaces, then you will have problems. Best to also change  precode    set concatFiles to concatFiles &amp; " " &amp;  imageName /code/pre  to  precode    set concatFiles to concatFiles &amp; " " &amp; quoted form of imageName /code/pre  <comment237040> Can you show us what you have tried? <comment237041> What is the ultimate purpose of the list and what have you tried? What step are you have difficultly with? <comment237047> updated my post with a code snippet
