Terminal will not open new window on startup with Sierra <body> After upgrading to macOS Sierra, Terminal no longer opens with a new window on startup despite having the preference enabled. I have to click on the dock icon to open a new window. Is there a way to make Terminal honor the preference setting?  Here is a screenshot of my preferences img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Npf8q.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment323561> Can you share screenshot of the preference setting? <comment323680> @DenisRasulev Added screenshot to the question. <comment323722> Well...

By "startup" we understand startup of the terminal *application*, not the startup of the *computer*, right? <comment323922> Yes, the startup of terminal
