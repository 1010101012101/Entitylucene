How to run Xquartz in rootless mode? <body> Is here any way to run the codeXquartz/code in rootless mode?  So when start e.g. codexterm/code, will get only one codexterm/code window without the whole black screen background?  <answer97558> The problem was in the Xquartz preferences. Have clicked the "full-screen" mode. Unclicked it and all working nicely, without the black screen.
