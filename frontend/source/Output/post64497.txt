How to rename multiple files at once? <body> I want to rename multiple files at once. For example:   precodePicture1.jpg Picture2.jpg Picture3.jpg Picture4.jpg /code/pre  into  precodeVacation-Picture1.jpg Vacation-Picture2.jpg Vacation-Picture3.jpg Vacation-Picture4.jpg /code/pre  I am quite familiar with the terminal, if there is no app which is quite good in renaming files.  <answer64499> While not a Terminal solution, I like Forklift for this purpose (and for many others). From their website:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zlCan.jpg" alt="Forklift&#39;s Multi-rename feature description" title="Forklift&#39;s Multi-rename feature description"  <answer64504> Try something like this:   precode for file in Picture*.jpg  do     mv "$file" "vacation-$file"  done   /code/pre  (open terminal and add one line {press Enter} at a time.)  What that does is uses the variable file for each entry matching codePicture*.jpg/code. Then it takes the file or folder and moves it to be prefixed with "vacation".  Hope that helps  <answer64515> I like user933531's answer, but if you'd like a GUI, the A Better Finder Rename app is really good. I got it from the App Store.  <answer64521> If you prefer a more flexible solution and are able to work with regular expressions this little perl script is very helpful:  precode#!/usr/bin/perl # rename - Larry's filename fixer # Usage: rename perlexpr [files]  ($op = shift) || die "Usage: rename perlexpr [filenames]\n";  chomp(@ARGV = &lt;STDIN&gt;) unless @ARGV;  for (@ARGV) {     $was = $_;     eval $op;     die $@ if $@;     rename($was,$_) unless $was eq $_; } /code/pre  <answer196119> precodebrew install rename  rename s/config\./route\.config\./g * /code/pre  First you need homebrew installed. Then install rename, and the above regex renames all files with "config." to "route.config".  So say files config.a.js, and config.b.js - route.config.a.js, route.config.b.js.  <answer239259> No need for command line...  ol liAdd all the images to be renamed into a folder./li liSelect all files, right click mouse and select "Rename emx/em items"/li liSelect "Add text" from first drop down menu/li liSelect "Before name" from the second drop down menu/li liEnter "Vacation_" into the text box (without the quotation marks)/li liPress Enter./li /ol  <answer258082> If you want to bulk rename files I built a small script for that.  precode# Rename Bullk files. # Renames all the files in PWD with the given extension. # # @param extension | jpg # @param new_name | name # Usage: rename jpg new_name function rename() {     echo "———————————————— STARTED ————————————————"      # Counter.     COUNTER=1      # For do loop.     for file in *."$1"; do         mv "$file" "$2-$COUNTER.$1"         COUNTER=$[$COUNTER +1]     done     echo "———————————————— ✔✔✔ RENAMED Every $1 file in the PWD! ✔✔✔︎ ————————————————" } /code/pre  Just put it in your code.bashrc/code or code.zshrc/code and run codeUsage: rename jpg new_name/code this will rename all jpg files in the PWD to new_name-1.jpg, new_name-2.jpg, etc.  Cheers!  <comment75744> Yep, for sure there is a terminal based solution. I also found this on mighty google ;) http://manytricks.com/namemangler/ <comment75745> You may as well post NameMangler as an additional answer, since this is basically a recommendation question. :) <comment116337> Interesting but not clear how it works. Can you give an example or two? <comment313083> To rename multiple files(recursively) with Forklift .. just select all files then expend all directories by CMD+right .. till you cover them all .. its working with me
