Mac Air Flash Drive Retrieval <body> If my Mac Air has been water damaged, can I still retrieve the data from the flash drives even though the machine will not start at all?   <answer51070> If the SSD is undamaged, yes. You could still open the Macbook Air, get the SSD and place it, either in other MacBook Air or those Enclosure things.  iFixit has a step-by-step guide for replacing the SSD.
