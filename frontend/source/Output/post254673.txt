python script to create a desktop icon <body> Right now I'am using npm start to open a desktop app (i.e nodejs server) which uses electron framework. So when ever I want to open that desktop app I have to open the terminal, go the application directory and use command "npm start" to open the nodejs server i.e desktop app.  I want to write a python scrip to create a desktop app, and when ever I double click that desktop icon, it should internally uses 'npm start' command to open that desktop app.    Can any one please help me, and my application directory is as: /Desktop/Electron/charityapp.  <answer254675> ul liOpen Terminal/li licodecd ~/Desktop/code/li licodeecho '#!/bin/sh' &gt; run-my-app/code/li licodeecho 'cd ~/Desktop/Electron/charityapp' &gt;&gt; run-my-app/code/li licodeecho 'npm start' &gt;&gt; run-my-app/code/li licodechmod +x run-my-app/code/li /ul  Then just double-click on the icon on the Desktop
