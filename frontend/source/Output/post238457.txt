Wifi connection often takes priority over Ethernet <body> I'm using an Apple Thunderbolt Display for network Ethernet connection of my MBPr 15 and I often experience something that is very odd.  Ethernet has top priority on my network list (i.e. it's not this issue https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/142500/24561).  What happens is that I notice slow speeds while I'm copying a large file over the network. If I then disable the Wifi connection (mid-transfer) the transfer will stall for a few moments and after that it will resume at much greater speed.  I don't think this is not specific to my OS X iteration as this is a behavior I've experienced for a very long time now, I just don't mind it too much.   Do you have any suggestions on how to troubleshoot this?  Regards  Edit: explanation in the comments  <comment292542> Given that the OP is asking theoretically for how OS X behaves with network priority and the explanation is essentially based on how you configure OS X to handle, I don't think it is a duplicate. In what way does it explain the incorrect behavior I'm experiencing? At best you have this @daniel-azuelos user that is wondering something similar there but another user corrects him to say that that is not the OP question. <comment292543> I.e. that question is mostly about the same thing with the link I pasted in my OP.
