Command-F (search) in Finder <body> As shown in the screenshot when I do a command-F (Find files ?) all of the files in the directory just do not show anymore (there are hundreds of files in the /shared directory)  strongUpdate/strong strongemOf course / naturally/em/strong I typed in values to the search field. E.g pdf  I also used the dropdowns (type PDF). No change - i.e. nothing shows up.  So what is going on with the command-F.

As soon as you begin typing your query the results will appear.  From OS X: Keyboard shortcuts     Command-F Find any matching Spotlight attribute   As long as nothing is entered there is no match.  If you just want to move the input focus to the search field without starting a search use kbdcommand/kbd+kbdoption/kbd+kbdF/kbd  <comment209854> why are you missing the search filed entry in your cmd+f? or is it just not showing in your screen shot! <comment209860> as soon you type anything in the search field they will show.... <comment209875> of course i tried that. <comment209879> did you end up installing xtrafinder? that program re-maps many of Finderâ€™s key combinations... <comment209916> @njboot  I just installed it .. *after* the above issues surfaced.
