My MacBook Air keeps restarting <body> My MacBook Air keeps restarting and won't pass the apple sign. I tried to reinstall the system but it says I don't have enough disk space to install and needs to remove something. What should I do?  <answer245850> Do you have a strongTime Machine backup/strong on an external (USB, FireWire) hard drive? If so, boot to Recovery (Apple + R), erase the drive and reinstall OS X, then restore your data via Migration Assistant.   Your core issue here is strongyou do not have enough space on your hard drive for all your data/strong. You're going to have to either:  - Delete some of your data or  - Clone the old hard drive to a larger drive (this is the perfect time to upgrade to a SSD, also).   <comment303135> How did you try to reinstall the system? <comment303141> Can you boot in [Verbose Mode](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201573) to see what messages are being generated.
