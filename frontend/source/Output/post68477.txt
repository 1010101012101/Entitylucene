iTunes Books lists <body> I have little space on the iPad and I need to do the following:  ul liOn work days: sync a books collection that relates to work/li liOn off-word days: sync a books collection that is "just for me"/li /ul  Short of creating 2 iTunes profiles, how would you solve this?  With music, I can just create "playlists" and selectively sync those...  <answer68483> ol liGo to your device in the left pane. Open the Books tab./li liUnder “Sync Books”, mark Selected Books./li liSelect which books you want to sync, each time you sync./li /ol  Though books can be added to playlists, I can’t seem to figure out how to sync them.  <comment79607> Yes, this is one-by-one clicking unfortunately... isn't it? <comment79683> Yep. Though you can create playlists of books, there’s no way to mark them up for sync. That’s really stupid.
