How to retrieve pictures from guest account? <body> I have saved pictures in my MacBook Air on a Guest Account. I am trying to locate my pictures in guest account but am unable to find it. How can I retrieve these?  <answer106154> On an Apple guest account, the home directory is wiped each time you logout or shutdown. That's why it's called a 'guest account', because it is meant to be temporary.   You will need a tool to recover deleted files if they have not been overwritten by new files in the time between when they were deleted and now.  <answer106163> There is no way to recover those pictures unless you're willing to try out some paid tools for recovering information from a disk (there's no guarantee even in that case).  emA guest account is temporary/em - a home folder is created only for the duration while the user is logged in. The moment the guest user logs out, all files are deleted from the system.
