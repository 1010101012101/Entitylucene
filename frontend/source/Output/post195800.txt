How to change computer name as it shows up in AirDrop? <body> I use AirDrop quite often to quickly send pictures that I take on my iPhone, to my Mac. The problem is, I have several Macs (all of them are Mac minis) and when I activate AirDrop on my iPhone, they all show up with the exact same name.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dIf21.jpg" alt="AirDrop on my iPhone"  I've Googled, and the only three ways of changing the displayed name in AirDrop that I've found are:  ol lichanging the computer name in codeSystem Preferences -&gt; Sharing -&gt; Computer Name/code,/li lichanging the "Me" card's name in Contacts, or/li limodifying a Plist file with the commandbr codedefaults write com.apple.NetworkBrowser DisableAirDrop -bool YES/code./li /ol  Unfortunately, none of these are working for me. code1/code doesn't seem to apply, as my computers already have unique names in the Sharing control panel, but they don't show up in the AirDrop display on my iPhone. code2/code wouldn't work, because changing the "me" card would sync across to the other Mac (my contacts are syncing using iCloud). I tried code3/code and it doesn't work either - the AirDrop item disappears from Finder, however my computer still shows up in the AirDrop display on my iPhone. The only working solution I found was by turning off WiFi on any computers that I strongdon't/strong want to show up in AirDrop, which prevents them from showing up in AirDrop on my iPhone. Fortunately this works for me, since I typically AirDrop files to only one of my computers, and all of my computers are connected via Ethernet anyway, so WiFi is unnecessary for network connectivity. Is there a different way of either changing a computer's name or making it disappear entirely from AirDrop?  <answer206595> You can opt out of AirDrop on a Mac quite easily.  ul liturn off WiFi/li liUse an OS X Profile to disable sharing via AirDrop (MDM such as OS X server.app's profile manager can do this easily)/li /ul  Setting the name should be easy to test. Open the sharing preference pane and make one Apple an Orange. Watch that the names change. If not, you've got a caching issue with your network and might want to power off all AppleTV and Airport devices at the same time to get a clean start to that cache. I haven't figured a more elegant way to purge the collective shared cache of bonjour names that works as well as a total outage there.  <answer291190> For me just now using ios 10.3.2 and macos Sierra, changing the computer name in codeSystem Preferences/code - codeSharing/code worked great. You said that didn't work for you, but it may help others.  <answer295957> One clue is that the strongCurrent User/strong in strongUsers and Groups/strong menu is associated with one of your contacts. I've tried to modify the first name of my contact card. On my iPhone, it did display with modified name.  https://support.apple.com/kb/PH22743?locale=en_US  You might try to create different contact cards for your computers to distinguish them (even with different avatars). I haven't tested it, 'cause I have only one Mac.  Hope it's helpful.  <comment233793> Have you tried editing the name in System Preferences  Sharing ? <comment307695> It's not showing the computer name at all. It shows the Apple ID user's name and the top of device.
