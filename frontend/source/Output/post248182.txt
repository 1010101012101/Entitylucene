OSX connection configuration issue to rack application <body> I am on mac ElCapitan 10.11.6 (15G31) and running simple rack application coderackup -p 5004/code. I can connect to it with codehttp://localhost:5004//code and codehttp://[::1]:5004//code  But can't connect with codehttp://127.0.0.1:5004//code and codehttp://192.168.0.111:5004//code.  This looks like mis-configuration on my machine. I get different errors when try to connect with IPv4 and IPv6.  precode$ nc -v -4 192.168.0.111 5004 # and nc -v -4 127.0.0.1 5004 and nc -v -4 localhost 5004 nc: connectx to 192.168.0.111 port 5004 (tcp) failed: Connection refused  $ nc -v -6 192.168.0.111 5004 # and nc -v -6 127.0.0.1 5004 nc: getaddrinfo: nodename nor servname provided, or not known /code/pre  But I can connect with codenc -v -6 localhost 5004/code  My hosts file is pretty simple:  precode$ cat /etc/hosts                                                                                                                                                        127.0.0.1       localhost 255.255.255.255 broadcasthost ::1             localhost /code/pre  I need to make it work with my host machine IP address code192.168.0.111/code so I can connect within Docker container. How to fix this?  hr  Additional information I found on different topics  ul liscutil  precode$ scutil -r 192.168.0.111 Reachable, Local Address, Directly Reachable Address  $ scutil -r 127.0.0.1 Reachable, Local Address, Directly Reachable Address  $ scutil -r localhost Reachable  $ scutil -r ::1 Reachable, Local Address, Directly Reachable Address  # but note, ??? $ scutil -r qwerty Reachable /code/pre/li lilsof port usage/li /ul  codelsof/code shows port is by ruby executable and the interesting part is codelocalhost:avt-profile-1/code. Checking what codeavt-profile-1/code is gives results for "Real-time Transport Protocol media data". More info here. Also interesting is when I stop the coderackup/code application there is no port usage, so this is not service/daemon running on my machine.  precodelsof -i :5004 COMMAND   PID USER   FD   TYPE             DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME ruby    12167 kode   16u  IPv6 0xf3c39e30b59c5321      0t0  TCP localhost:avt-profile-1 (LISTEN) /code/pre  Here I have different application running on port 5000. It's reachable via the host IP at code192.168.0.111:5000/code. Note the NAME code*:commplex-main/code. Addittionaly I would like to know what this is used for.  precodelsof -i :5000 COMMAND   PID USER   FD   TYPE             DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME ruby    12889 kode   14u  IPv4 0xf3c39e30b22fcbe9      0t0  TCP *:commplex-main (LISTEN) /code/pre  ul lihost address name  precodehost 192.168.0.111 111.0.168.192.in-addr.arpa has no PTR record /code/pre/li liarp  precode$ arp 192.168.0.111 ?

It turned out to be a bad script Chrome was executing. I solved the problem by using Safari instead.  <answer248276> The issue was coderackup/code runs on localhost by default. To use host one must specify it with code-o/code like coderackup -o 192.168.0.111 -p 5004/code. Only one host can be specified.  <comment306453> This seems to be not my case. It's the same in Safari and  Opera. @chromaticsyllabus did you isolate which script was running? <comment306454> For some reason nsIQTScriptablePlugin.xpt (ordinarily a Safari plugin you should keep running, see https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203353) was being hijacked by Chrome. If you check Chrome's task manager you may be able to see this. Not sure if Opera has something similar. <comment306456> I have the plugin too `$ locate nsIQTScriptablePlugin.xpt/Library/Internet Plug-Ins/Disabled Plug-Ins/nsIQTScriptablePlugin.xpt`   `$ file /Library/Internet\ Plug-Ins/Disabled\ Plug-Ins/nsIQTScriptablePlugin.xpt /Library/Internet Plug-Ins/Disabled Plug-Ins/nsIQTScriptablePlugin.xpt: XPConnect Typelib version 1.1` <comment306458> I don't see this plugin in `chrome://plugins/` running `about:plugins` in Chrome address bar. Had 4 other plugins. Disabling them doesn't solve the issue. <comment307565> Welcome to Ask Different.  We like answers to be more than just a single line.
