How to free space on Time Machine on a Netgear NAS? <body> I have obsolete time machine backup file in Netgear NAS with another one. I cannot so just format or erase whole disk. I just need to delete the non-used file from taking disk space. I am running 10.6.8 Snow leopard and I haven't found a way to delete it. TM does not recognize file anymore so I can't use the "star wars" to access it and delete. I tried to delete using view package but nothing seem to happen when deleting files one or many. Normal deleting does not seem to work.  Anyone done it? I need a proven solution!  <answer141794> I found this to work:  http://www.readynas.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=71&amp;t=60831  precode$ cd /Volumes/ReadyNAS-1/ $ rm -rf macbook.sparsebundle /code/pre  It took a while to delete 300 GB but worked, diskspace increased!
