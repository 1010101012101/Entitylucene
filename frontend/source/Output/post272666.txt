Weird behaviour concerning sound output <body> A few minutes ago, I disconnected my earphones after listening to part of a 2h47m audio file from Finder preview, and perhaps closing the preview (though that might have happened after disconnecting the earphones), and the volume was suddenly gone. But not only was it gone: I couldn't turn it back on! The volume icon in the menu bar looked like this: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/44pJs.png" alt="enter image description here". Normally, it looks like this: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/v0hNm.png" alt="enter image description here". That is, its percentage of black had decreased. I think there was also something strange with the following:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0wvzz.png" alt="enter image description here"  which is what appears when you raise the volume. IIRC, it appeared with the volume icon (or maybe the whole square) barred out with a line going from bottom-left to top-right, and when I pressed the volume keys, the little squares at the bottom that indicate the volume level behaved as they normally would, turning gray or white depending on what I pressed, but there was no sound output. Somehow, I noticed that a red light was coming out of the earphones hole (where you stick in the earphones' cable to use the earphones). So I tried reconnecting the earphones, but nothing changed. I opened sound preferences, Output tab, reconnected the earphones, disconnected them, and the light was gone and the volume was back. I think it is the second time this happens to my computer, and, if I am right about this, the other time I solved it by restarting. I have Mac OSX Lion (10.7.5), with a 2.4GHz Intel Core i5 and «Memory    4GB 1333 MHz DDR3» (quoted from About This Mac). Does anyone have any idea why this weird, irreproduceable behaviour took place?
