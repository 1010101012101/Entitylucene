How to disable wifi while running Migration Assistant? <body> After starting to run Migration Assistant over wifi, I connected an Ethernet cable to both machines in order to speed up the transfer.

Both machines are running updated versions of Mavericks.   <comment161783> you can not switch services middle in the process.
