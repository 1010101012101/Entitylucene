iPhone 7 IOS 10.1 vs Microsoft Exchange Server = no dynamic fonts <body> iPhone 7 (and previously the 6) were updated to IOS 10 &amp; now 10.1  large fonts enabled &amp; enlarged as much as possible zoomed all the way... I tried all the rebooting &amp; force restarting, am now just hoping for an alternative email app suggestion that most closely resembles the ios mail client:  email messages which come into the native mail client, I think it's called ios mail, do not work with dynamic fonts in html email from a microsoft Exchange server.  The fonts are so teeny tiny.  Times New Roman is especially bad.  My boss cannot read the type.  Neither can I.  I imagine it would be really hard for the visually impaired.  Apple advises that they are aware of the problem with microsoft exchange servers.  Is there a mail app that looks &amp; acts very similar to the ios mail to try?  we have tried several popular ones, unfortunately our users did not like the ones which did recognize dynamic type (outlook of course plays well with microsoft exchange server, but users did not like it)  simple email, nothing fancy,  - inbox, ability to handle multiple email accounts, see all the folders - easy to see easy to open &amp; easy to email... and ability to not be limited in days of viewing - like need to be able to see those 10 year old 2006 emails that are all the way back &amp; still on the server.  in short what ios mail looks &amp; acts like but one that will recognize dynamic fonts from an exchange server  Thanks so much for any help!!!!!
