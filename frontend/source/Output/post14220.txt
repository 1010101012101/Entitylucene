Zip Utility with encryption option <body> Is there any good zip application for Mac OS X similar to 7-Zip (Windows only) which is free, compatible with many formats, and offers encryption options?  <answer14224> Check out Keka - the free Max OS X file archiver img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oYHnK.png" alt="enter image description here"     With 7z and Zip you will have the   opportunity to create password   encrypted files to better protect your   privacy. It's as easy as write your   password in the box, and drag and drop   files to Keka in the dock.   hr  Another way is to run the command in your Terminal.app:  precode$ zip -e myzip.zip &lt;files&gt; /code/pre  After the command you will be prompted for a password. Instead of the single files you can specify a folder, too.  hr  I don't know of any more apps that allow you to create archives with many formats. For decrompression there are multiple great apps (The Unarchiver, Stuffit Expander). You can give strong7zipX/strong a try, too.  Some paid alternatives:  ul liBetterZip/li liStuffIt/li liArchiver/li /ul  <answer14255> The unarchiver and simplyRAR in addition to keka.  <comment15334> +1 - Great answer. I'll check out Keka now. Cheers. <comment22292> What encryption does `zip -e` use? AES? The `man` page only says that it encrypts with the password entered. <comment22344> Couldn't find anything. But man page also states `And where security  is truly  important,  use strong encryption such as Pretty Good Privacy instead of the relatively weak standard encryption provided by zipfile utilities.` So I guess you should care about encryption yourself.
