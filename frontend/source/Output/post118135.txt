Error during install Leopard on iBook G4, now can't mount drive <body> I have an iBook G4 that was running 10.3.9 and I was attempting to install 10.5 via Firewire transfer as the optical drive is not working. During the install, the power lead failed and the laptop shutdown.   The install failed midway and now I have no system available on the laptop. I can see (from Firewire mode) the Hard Drive but no unmountable option available. I've tried selecting the HD and erasing it but it won't let me. I've tried Partitioning and it won't work.   Need to install 10.5 on the laptop and it was clearly working prior to this error during installation so I know it wasn't an HD error/fault.  What should I do next?  <comment137866> Format it back to HFS+ Format?
