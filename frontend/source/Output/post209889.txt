PostgreSQL- Cannot connect to server <body> strongPREFACE:/strong I just bought my first Mac laptop a week ago so that I could get some work done on my trip, but so far I've spent most of my time trying to solve an issue with PostgreSQL. Something went wrong and I don't know what caused it.  strongSPECS:/strong  Macbook Air OS X Yosemite (10.10.5)  psql (PostgreSQL) 9.4.4 installed with Homebrew  strongISSUE:/strong I receive this error when attempting to connect to my database:  precode2015-09-28 16:18:18 ERROR  : ERROR:  could not open extension control file "/Library/PostgreSQL/9.4/share/postgresql/extension/postgis.control": No such file or directory 2015-09-28 16:44:23 ERROR  : Error connecting to the server: could not connect to server: Connection refused     Is the server running locally and accepting     connections on Unix domain socket "/tmp/.s.PGSQL.5432"? /code/pre  I've tried a bunch of different things to fix it, but Ive gotten nowhere. As far as I can tell, code/tmp/.s.PGSQL.5432/code does not exist on my system, but I may not have found the correct search syntax. I've been using codefind ~ -name ".s.PGSQL.5432"/code. How should I go about troubleshooting this?  strongEDIT/strong: Following up on a comment:  Attempting to run codepg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres start/code results in the following experience:  precode$ pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres start pg_ctl: could not open PID file "/usr/local/var/postgres/postmaster.pid": Permission denied $ sudo pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres start pg_ctl: cannot be run as root Please log in (using, e.g., "su") as the (unprivileged) user that will own the server process. $ su PostgreSQL Password: bash-3.2$ pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres start pg_ctl: could not open PID file "/usr/local/var/postgres/postmaster.pid": Permission denied bash-3.2$ sudo pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres start  We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System Administrator. It usually boils down to these three things:      #1) Respect the privacy of others.     #2) Think before you type.     #3) With great power comes great responsibility.  Password: postgres is not in the sudoers file.  This incident will be reported. bash-3.2$  /code/pre  It seems that it is asking me to run a sudo command from an unprivileged user account. I don't quite know what to do with that. Should this be placed in a seperate question?  <answer209898> This means that you don't have an instance of PostgreSQL running right now.  Try to rerun your instance of PostgreSQL:  precodepg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres start /code/pre  <comment253215> `$ pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres` .  `pg_ctl: no operation specified Try "pg_ctl --help" for more information.` <comment253216> @AdamStarrh sorry, please look at the updated answer <comment253219> I've tried that, added it to the question <comment253220> @AdamStarrh Press CTRL+D to log out from `postgres` user and try to run `sudo pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres start` (you should be logged in as user with administrator privileges) <comment253221> I get: `pg_ctl: cannot be run as root Please log in (using, e.g., "su") as the (unprivileged) user that will own the server process.` which is why I had switched to the PostgreSQL account.. <comment253222> @AdamStarrh ok, then just try to run it without sudo with the same user <comment253224> I think the last paragraph is this question and you need to edit it to make it clearer - posters usually runs under user postgres so you will need an admin account or use [Postgres.app](http://postgresapp.com) <comment253225> `pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres start pg_ctl: could not open PID file "/usr/local/var/postgres/postmaster.pid": Permission denied` The file `postmaster.pid` is actually I file I had deleted in my troubleshooting steps, as this seemed to fix for alot of other people. <comment253227> @AdamStarrh strange. try to run `sudo chown -R postgres /usr/local/var/postgres/` and then try to run pg_ctl from postgres user once again <comment253228> Permission no longer denied! It still does not allow me to run the original command as root. When I run it via the PostgreSQL user: `pg_ctl: directory "/usr/local/var/postgres" is not a database cluster directory` '` <comment253231> @AdamStarrh that's strange because it's a usual location of postgrsql data folder for homebrew. What are contents of your `/usr/local/var/postgres` folder? <comment253232> I ran `initdb -D /usr/local/var/postgres` and it seemed to spin it back up!! I can run it now with `postgres -D /usr/local/var/postgres/` Now I just have to figure out how to get my user roles back, but this helped me tremendously!
