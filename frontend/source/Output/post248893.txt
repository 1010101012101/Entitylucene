I think I lost everything after boot camp <body> I tried to install Windows 10 into my emBoot Camp/em partition.  I exited the setup and, normally, my computer restarts and I log into the Mac.  Now it's just a black screen flashing a folder icon with a code?/code on it.  I think I've lost everything and I'm very confused and scared. Please can anyone help me?  <answer248896> You have three options, they go from best to worst:  ol liReboot into your recovery partition by holding down kbdCommand/kbd+kbdr/kbd, and open disk utility, and attempt to repair your drive./li liStill in the recovery partition, restore from backup, which most people do these days./li liReinstall OS X, and begin taking backups so #2 will work./li /ol  Hope this helps.  <comment308575> You most likely corrupted OS X. Have you tried to reboot into Recovery HD and reinstall OS X? <comment308579> Try restarting you Mac while holding down the option key. This should invoke the Startup Manager. See if there is an option to boot back to OS X. <comment308581> Just a quick side note: If you are not able to reinstall OS X (happened to me), it is possible that your logic board has failed as well. <comment308587> If he can't install OS X, then either he needs to google, or his computer is broken and he needs to buy a new one. His computer doesn't sound broken, so... <comment308602> we can't be sure. There is no need to buy a new computer, it is a simple $150 fix. This has happened to me before, so I just shared my experience.
