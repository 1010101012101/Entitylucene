Skipping .DS_Store files when copying between two external drives <body> There are quite a few questions on code.DS_Store/code files already, but none seem to answer my problem.  I have an external hard drive with a dozen of ~ 50 GB backup folders. When I try to copy these folders to a new external hard drive by drag-and-drop, it fails because     .DS_Store already exists and could not copied.br   [Stop]   To circumvent this issue, stronghow can I skip copying .DS_Store files when copying between two hard drives?/strong  A Terminal command solution certainly exists, but I am not well-versed enough in codecp/code to find it myself. All help appreciated!  P.S. Both disks are Mac OS X Extended (Journaled).  <answer95879> Try codersync -rv --exclude=.DS_Store &lt;source&gt; &lt;destination&gt;/code from terminal.  for example  codersync -rv --exclude=.DS_Store ~/Documents /Volumes/Backup/Documents/code  will do:  ul li(-r) recursive (copy everything below ~/Documents)/li li(-v) verbose (tell you what it's doing)/li li(--exclude) excluding any file named code.DS_Store/code/li lifrom code~/Documents/code/li lito  code/Volumes/Backup/Documents/code/li /ul  codersync/code is like a suped up codecp/code command with way more options, most specifically code--exclude/code  <comment112508> Are you copying to an existing directory? I assume otherwise there would not be a .DS_Store file o the target, but in this case are you overwriting any other files <comment112509> I'm copying directly to the disk root, not to an existing directory, and there are no existing files on the target, so there is no overwrite. <comment112511> The error messages says there is a .DS_Store file on the target - what does `ls -al` show on the target? <comment112589> That is _exactly_ what I was looking for, thank you! <comment112602> `ls- al` shows nothing particular: I presume it's a corrupted file issue (the `.DS_Store` files have been causing trouble for some time now). <comment112613> SO where is the .DS_Store you are trying to overwrite? <comment112763> I don't know that, otherwise I would have deleted the file manually. It took place as I described it: I dropped a large archive folder at the root of a new hard drive, and it repeatedly failed midway because of the message posted above. I cannot say which `.DS_Store` file among the hundreds in my archive was causing trouble, so skipping them was the best strategy. <comment112764> I am asking about what is on the target you say there are non, but the code says there is, I suspect you are not actually doing what you think you are <comment112765> However rsync is often the better way anyway <comment112768> Making sure that there was _nothing_ on target was my first move, but the problem occurred _inside_ the archive, which is large and therefore likely to contain errors. And yes, `rsync` saved my day :)
