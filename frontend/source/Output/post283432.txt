What's turning on my Logitech webcam? <body> I have a Logitech C920 webcam and after I use it for any type of video chat (whether it's in Slack, Skype or any other video chat service) the light on the webcam stays on until I restart my computer.  Is there a way to see emwhat/em is causing the webcam to either actually be on or emappear/em to be on?  I'm running macOS 10.12.5 on a MacBook Pro (Retina, 13", Early 2015).  <comment357402> 10.12.4 is the latest version of macOS you cannot be running 10.12.5 at this point. <comment357735> @alljamin Beta program
