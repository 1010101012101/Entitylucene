How to move huge popup window in Yosemite? <body> After upgrading to Yosemite / Chrome updating (one of these two), I have difficulties to submit files via Google Chrome because the popup window for submitting is huge and lower buttons cannot be seen at all. The only way to operate that - double click on the file (I found that after some days!).  Look at the screenshot - it is the lower visible part of the popup window, but it is not a lower border of this window.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/D6zcJ.png" alt="enter image description here"  Is there any way to resize/move this window?   <answer155480> This is a bug with Google Chrome:  ul liIssue 150068: "Save as" modal sheet sometimes not sized correctly  https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=150068/li /ul  As a workaround, you can go fullscreen then open the sheet—this forces it to fit on the screen.  <comment182881> but can I move or resize that window? <comment182884> @Ilan I've added a workaround—standard OS X sheets *should* fit the screen when fullscreen. <comment182885> @Tetsujin Probably. Fullscreen helped! 10x. <comment182886> Fullscreen helped. Should I delete the question? <comment182887> @Ilan No need—it serves as another pointer to the resolution with completely different keywords, very useful for others looking for a solution. <comment182888> I added a new method to that answer - Alternatively, if you Cmd/Shift/drag from any edge of the 'parent' window, the window will resize from all sides simultaneously. <comment182889> I found the definite solution and the issue resolved completely - I resized the left border pressing Shift and the window minimized. Now, new popup are smaller and visible fully. <comment182890> @Ilan Interesting! Feel free to add that as an answer here or on the linked question so that it gets more visibility. <comment182891> @Tetsujin Ironically, I've tried all these buttons and the issue resolved completely - all new popup windows are smaller. <comment182892> hhh ironically the same answer was suggested in comments to the question... <comment182894> @Tetsujin I've voted up your answer on the link provided... <comment182896> @grgarside Can this question remain open, even linked as a dupe? - as you say, the keywords would make the solution easier to find if both remained active. <comment182897> @Tetsujin Not sure I understand what you mean—linking it as a duplicate will prevent new answers (closing it) but it still exists and is searchable to direct users. <comment182901> OK, no problem then. I'm still a bit of a newbie on exactly where old questions go to die ;-)
