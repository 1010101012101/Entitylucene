Flash stopped working in Safari <body> There's tons of threads on this but I can't find a solution that works (e.g. this here). When using Safari, Flash is not working on any website. Youtube e.g. recommends to install the newest version (which it of course is already). Flash works without problems in Firefox though.   I'm using Safari 6.0.5 and Flash 11.8.800.94 is installed.   I tried   ul lide/reinstalling/li liDeleting the plugin files in /Library/Internet\ Plug-Ins/li liDeinstalling, restarting then reinstalling/li liDisabling all extensions (Ghostery, Clickto, etc)/li /ul  <comment115968> Have you tried everything here also?  http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/installation-problems-flash-player-mac.html   Also try uninstaller tool: http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/uninstall-flash-player-mac-os.html <comment116004> I did use the uninstaller, also when doing a restart before reinstalling. There isn't really anything else than I did on the trouble shooting page. <comment116006> Did you just disable extensions or completely delete?  I saw a report of someone needing to actually completely delete the clicktoflash extension to get that working <comment116015> You did a lot already. One question i have is what do you mean with stopped working? How? what do you see? post a screen shot so we can see. <comment116038> Is it possible you have 'Allow all other plug-ins' unchecked in Preferences-Security? <comment116222> Thanks @David, that was actually it. 'Allow all other plug-ins' was unchecked.
