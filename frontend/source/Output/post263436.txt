Odd visudo problem in macOS Sierra <body> I'm currently running 10.12.2b4. When I try to run codesudo visudo/code I get the message:  precodevisudo: /etc/sudoers: Operation not permitted /code/pre  /etc/sudoers permissions appear correct, read-only root/wheel. My user is in the admin group, and I can execute sudo fine - even for visudo! I.e. if I run codesudo visudo -z/code (illegal option), I get:  precodevisudo: invalid option -- z usage: visudo [-chqsV] [-f sudoers] [-x output_file] /code/pre  I can also codesudo su/code to get a root shell and I still get the same 'Operation not permitted' error when I try and run codevisudo/code. As root, I can cat the sudoers file, which appears to be the stock out of the box file that ships with OS X.   Kind of stumped on this one.  Per patrix items:  precode/etc: lrwxr-xr-x@   1 root  wheel    11 Sep 20 23:46 etc -&gt; private/etc /code/pre  Running codevi /etc/sudoers/code after codesudo su/code works fine, file is read-only of course.   precode'sudo visudo -c' : /etc/sudoers: parsed OK /code/pre  Neither codeEDITOR/code or codeVISUAL/code are set.  precode/usr/sbin/visudo: ---x--x--x  1 root   wheel        202016 Sep 13 19:56 visudo /code/pre  And yes, I really get a root shell from codesudo su/code and codesudo cat /etc/master.passwd/code outputs the passwd file.  No codesudoers.tmp/code file in code/private/etc/code or code/tmp/code. Also tried manually setting codeEDITOR/code and codeVISUAL/code to codevi/code but still get the same error.  <comment330031> Things I would do first (and please edit the results into the question): Check permissions of `/etc`, run `vi /etc/sudoers` as root (without changing/saving), check (and unset) `$EDITOR` and `$VISUAL`, run `sudo visudo -c` <comment330032> Also, what are the permissions/ownership on `/usr/sbin/visudo`? Does `sudo su` (or `sudo -s`) really open a root shell (check with `id`), does `sudo cat /etc/master.passwd` work? <comment330042> `visudo` tries to create `/private/etc/sudoers.tmp`, can you check whether there is a leftover file with that name? <comment330095> Next round: can you copy (as root) your sudoers file to another place (where the admin user has write permissions) and then run `visudo -f /path/to/copy/sudoers`? Also, running `ls -l /etc/sudoers` might give some clues.
