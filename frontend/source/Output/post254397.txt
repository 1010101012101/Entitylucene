Apps stuck waiting for an update, won't delete <body> I updated my iPhone 5c to iOS10. I have three apps that have been stuck in the dimmed 'waiting' state for almost 24 hours now, and they don't delete when I hold down and click the x to delete them.   They appear in the App Store as the loading circle with the square in it.  My iTunes library on my computer has no 'app' section to delete apps from, and when I go to my iPhone itself through iTunes, it doesn't show the apps i'm trying to load as options on my phone, it just shows the icons.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sbzHj.png" alt="from my itunes"  WhatsApp and Pokemon GO are two of the apps stuck in the waiting state. Does anyone have a solution that isn't a factory reset, or is that my only hope of fixing this?  <answer254399> I would try doing a full reboot of your iPhone by holding down the power button and home key simultaneously for about 10 seconds until you see the Apple Logo appear on a black screen.  If that doesn't resolve the issue, I would also:  ol liGo into your App Store app/li liScroll to the very bottom of the screen/li liTap on your Apple ID/li liTap on Sign Out/li /ol  Once you've signed out, sign back in and see if that makes a difference.  <comment316722> @ monomeeth thank you for the reply, but sadly neither of those worked :( i'm trying to do an icloud backup now.
