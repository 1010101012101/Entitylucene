iPod Nano 4G A1285 stuck at Apple boot logo <body> I have a iPod Nano 4th Generation (A1285) that I got used. When I first got it, it had low power, and it took a while to turn on, my iPod charger was broken at the time, so I couldn't charge it. Now, I'm trying to restore it for music and movies, etc. It turned on once yesterday when I tried fixing it, it was on briefly before I restored it. It took a while to turn on, I have no idea how I did it. Right now iTunes is going on and off, we've tried Disk mode, recovery mode and diagnostic mode. I've restored it around 7 times in Disk and recovery mode. Currently, I think it's dead. iTunes shows a 2005 error, ipod cannot be identified. Now, I just put it in recovery mode and restored it, again. Stuck at apple logo. Now it's still at the apple logo. just, waiting.... Alright, we put it in DISK MODE and restored it. restore took longer than usual. still apple logo. More info: When i got it used, and it was in itunes before i restored it for the first time, it said format macintosh, and i'm on windows 8 so I restored it . Now, It's in disk mode, sitting on my computer, blinking "do not disconnect" because I have no idea what to do, I really need help.
