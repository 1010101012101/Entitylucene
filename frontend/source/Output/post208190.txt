Is there a keyboard shortcut to pin a tab? <body> In the Safari 9 for OS X El Capitan there is a new feature whereby you can pin a tab. As a result you will see a colored icon with the first letter of the website.   Now I wonder if there is a keyboard shortcut to do that automatically without me first right-click on that tab to pin it. When I go to strongWindow  Pin Tab/strong I see no shortcut. I know that this does not always mean that there is no keyboard shortcut for it.  Thanks in advance.  <answer208192> I'm not on El Capitan yet. But if there is a menu bar entry in Safari to create a pinned tab, you can assign a custom keyboard shortcut.  ol liGo to strongSystem Preferences  Keyboard/strong/li liSelect the strongShortcuts/strong Tab/li liSelect strongApp Shortcuts/strong at the bottom of the list/li liCreate a new shortcut:  ul liApplication Safari/li liThe title is the exact name of the menu bar entry/li liChoose a shortcut that you like/li /ul/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WLqUG.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment251112> With "command" do you mean a keyboard shortcut? <comment251113> I do not know why I said command. Thanks for noticing. <comment251118> Thanks, I now have a shortcut for Pin Tab and Unpin Tab. Now when I pin a tab it will pin or unpin it depending on the current state of the tab window. Still wondering if there is a native shortcut for this. <comment251130> Not sure. I've tried googling without success.
