How do I prevent iTunes TOS prompt? <body> iTunes has been popping up several times per day asking me to accept or decline their TOS.  I have declined for the past 5-ish years (2.5 years on this laptop in particular) because it is not a piece of software that I want or need.  Previously, it was a one-time decline, and I wouldn't see it again.  However, there must have been an update to the software that is causing it to pop up nonstop.  It is extremely frustrating, especially since I can't just drag the app to the trash bin.  How can I stop this from happening?  strongEdit:/strong 3 popups so far today, and it's 10am.  :rage:  <answer220433> Try disabling iTunesHelper.app:  ol liRemove iTunesHelper from Login Items./li liRename iTunesHelper.app in code/Applications/iTunes.app/Contents/MacOS//code to something else (e.g. iTunesHelper-disabled.app)./li /ol  <comment266776> Why don't you just accept it & never look at it again? What's the philosophical difference? <comment266778> Because I don't want to blindly accept TOS for something I don't intend to use. <comment266779> If you don't use it, what difference does it make? <comment266781> I can't tell if you're trolling me.  That's not a helpful response. <comment266782> No, I just don't get the foil-hat paranoia bit. Agree to the ToS it will go away. Never use the app, it will make no difference to your life whatsoever. <comment266783> It's not "foil-hat paranoia".  I'm done with this comment thread and will await real answers. <comment266870> Ahh, didn't know that was in there.  Thank you!
