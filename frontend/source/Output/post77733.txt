Safari always asks me to install the newest version of Java <body> I need to run an applet that requires the latest version of Java. Whenever I try to run that applet, it asks me if I want to install Java. So it sends me to the Java site and I download it. Then I restart safari, but when I try to run that applet again, it asks me again to install Java, and the applet won't run.  <comment90037> As far as I know, Safari is blocked from running Java until Oracle patches the latest security hole.
