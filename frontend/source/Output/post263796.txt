iBooks not updating its Table of Contents/pages on iPad <body> I regularly download epub ebooks that are free, some of them are original fiction or fanfiction of stories. Several of these are in progress and get updates from time to time.   The issue I am having is that iBooks on my iPad is seemly stuck using the original version of the epub's TOC and page numbers. The original was 13 chapters and 313 pages. The new one is 33 chapters and should be around 850. I cannot read past the end of the 13th chapter and page 313 (acts like it is the end of the book).  I deleted the old ebook and loaded the new on the ipad but it still has the 13 chapters and 313 pages for the ebook. I can load it on my iphone and it give's me the 33 chapters in the TOC and more pages for the book itself. I attempted to fix the issue by deleting the book and restarting ibooks afterwards, even doing the same but with the hard reset. Neither fixes the issue.   My main question is this: Is there a way to reset the ibooks memory on what books it has seen and what pages they are on without resetting the ipad itself or would that even work?  <comment330544> So, figured out a work around at least.

However, if someone does know how to fix this, I would like to know still
