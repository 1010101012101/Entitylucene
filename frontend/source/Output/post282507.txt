Can't remove screw of SuperDrive on my MBP mid 2012 MD 101 HN/A <body> I'm trying to replace my SuperDrive with another HDD. I read several instructions about it, and all they suggested that I need a strongPhilips #0 screwdriver/strong for removing the screws which are holding the SuperDrive. I tried with that exact screwdriver, but it's not working. Does this model require a different kind of screwdrivers,  because they're looking the same but not fitting at all? Please let me know if anyone has already been through this, about how you did it.  <comment355892> Did you try a Pozi- or Pro-drive instead. Often 'phillips' is a pretty generic cross-head, that doesn't quite fit any of the patented profiles. Pro-drive aims to fit both profiles, as its shape is about halfway between Phillips & Pozidrive <comment355893> no i only tried with Philips, gonna give it a try but <comment355899> Looking at the [ifixit.com](http://radnex.us/gqb96p8eko) guide specific to that model and procedure, it indicates that the tools required is a **Philips #00**  Is the screw damaged? <comment355905> well there are 3 screws, i tried on one of them (with some extra power) so it seems like it's a little stripped but the other 2 are totally fine still i can't open them so i think it's the ScrewDriver that i need to change and is there's any difference between **#0** and **#00** @Allan <comment355907> There's actually a #0000, #000, #00, and #0 so there is a difference.  See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_screw_drives#Phillips) for more details <comment355908> hmm... yeah - using the wrong size won't help either ;) <comment355909> alright i'm gonna try with #00 <comment355929> If that solves the issue, post it as an answer so you can gain some reputation points.
