Mac OS X 10.8 QuickLook Causing CPU & Temperature Spikes <body> I have consistently been having a problem with my computer overheating due to random processes using 100%+ CPU.  Commonly the problem occurs with the process codeQuickLookSatellite-general/code, but it is not limited to it. (Please see images below.)  When the codeQuickLookSatellite-general/code is the process in question, resetting the Quick Look Manager:  precodeqlmanage -r /code/pre  …seems to solve the problem.  Otherwise the problem continues until the application is closed or the process decides to stop.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/e9NMp.png" alt="QuickLookSatellite-general 196.4% CPU"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Kx6X1.png" alt="QuickLookSatellite-general 200% CPU"  On Google I found this process is associated with DraftSight, a CAD program. I do not and have never had this program installed.  Restarting does not even fix this problem. It makes my MacBook strongcompletely/strong unusable as I do not want it to be damaged running at 90℃.  Any assistance is appreciated.  Thanks!  EDIT *** Addition, found disabling/resetting mdworker helped substantially  precodesudo mdutil -i off / sudo mdutil -E / sudo rm -Rf /var/folder/* Reboot sudo mdutil -i on / (I just left it off.) /code/pre  <answer97329> To see what generators QuickLook has installed, open the Terminal (codeApplications/Utilities/Terminal.app/code) and run the following command:  precodeqlmanage -m /code/pre  This will give you a quick dump of what is loaded at the moment with QuickLook. Also pay attention to what directories you have open at the time your CPU spikes (QL doesn't generate thumbnails for anything other than a directory or file being displayed in the Finder or other application viewing a file list).  It will output something like this     [uniform type identifier] - path (version)   [uniform type identifier] - path (version - loaded)   The code-m/code flag also accepts several arguments:  ul listrongplugins/strong   Show the generators list (default action)/li listrongserver/strong    Show quicklookd life information/li listrongmemory/strong    Show quicklookd memory consumption/li listrongburst/strong     Show statistics about the last burst/li listrongthreads/strong   Show concurrent accesses stats/li listrongother/strong     Show other information about quicklookd/li /ul  Additionally, don't bother with codeman qlmanage/code as the manual isn't as good as the built-in help found at codeqlmanage -h/code.  If you want to see if DraftSight has a plugin loaded (or installed), try running codeqlmange -m plugins | grep -i "draftsight"/code.  <answer118359> What I also found helpful was to turn on QuickLook debugging so I could see exactly what files were being processed. You can do that with this in the terminal. More info in the Mac Developer Library.    precodedefaults write -g QLEnableLogging YES /code/pre  You can also adjust the debugging level using codeqlmanage -d debuglevel/code. Run codeqlmanage -h/code for more info.  In my particular case it was QuickSilver causing the issue, which I fixed by disabling image previews using this command in the terminal. My thread on that is here.  precodedefaults write com.blacktree.quicksilver "QSLoadImagePreviews" NO /code/pre  Also see this similar superuser question.   <answer130522> I had the same problem. It was caused because I left open a Finder window with a Search which seem it kept refreshing all the time.   I just closed that finder tab with the search and the 100% CPU dropped to a normal 3%, and the quicklookd process dissapeared from System monitor's list  <answer196109> It's a bug for sure, but the root-cause is a cached search in Finder which tries to find every file on the system and runs out of resource handles or something. It's an obvious use-case in Finder that I'm astonished nobody has spotted yet (but I have been a Unix/Linux system developer for 20 years).  When Finder is doing it, you can both get rid of the phantom 'suck search' immediately, but also fix it permanently with 2 button clicks:-  When you have the issue, on the finder menu bar, you'll see the 4 icons pertaining to switching views, list, columns, coverflow,  etc.  Just click one of the buttons once to change the view to something else from your usual default, then click the button pertaining to your default view preference to change it back.  You should notice 3 things:-  ul liThe CPU-spin stops immediately and normality returns./li liThe phantom stuck search gets removed/li liIt doesn't happen again - of course until you exercise the Finder design flaw (that's been there, what 7 years now!?!?) again. Just repeat until somebody wakes up and figures it out./li /ul  -Al.  <comment114132> Good job in narrowing it down. It is possible that the Draftsigh was a part of package of another program. <comment114133> Gotcha, anyway to check for this?  Heard of any other person having this problem?  Someone suggested it may be malware :/ <comment114402> Thank you very much for your assistance.  I did not find the draftsight plugin loaded.  I will definitely use this in the future. <comment114403> I also found resetting/disabling mdworker improved temp stability as well.  Seems to be running a good 6 to 10 C cooler on idle! <comment339474> I cannot believe this actually worked for me, still a bug on Sierra!
