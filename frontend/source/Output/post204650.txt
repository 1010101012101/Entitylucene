iPhone can't verify CalDAV account <body> I am using Google Calendar and I would like to sync it with my iPhone. Usually, the best way to do this is via setting up a CalDAV account which I've been successfully doing for a while.   However, recently, the syncing has ceased to work. So have I subsequently deleted and re-added the account to my iPhone, but I keep on getting an error message, that the CalDAV account cannot be verified.  Does anybody have any suggestions what I can do about this? I'm absolutely certain the all the data I enter is correct.  <answer204656> It may be that strongGoogle/strong have made the change.

You need to log into your Google Account - settings and choose signing into google.
