Help creating zip files with 50 files in each <body> I have a folder containing 7.000 images that needs to be zipped into zip files containing only 50 files each.  Any way of doing this automatically? Any script, Automator workflow, batch whatever would be helpful.  I am not very experienced in using either, so please be specific.  I am running OS X Yosemite.  <answer262287> Here's a quick and dirty BASH script.  Assumptions: All of your photos are in a folder, and there's nothing else in this folder.  precode#!/bin/bash zip_count=0 files_zipped=0 folder_number=1 div=50 numfiles=(*) numfiles=${#numfiles[@]}  mkdir zips  for file in * do    file_list="$file_list \"$file\""   let "zip_count=zip_count+1"   let "files_zipped=files_zipped+1"    if [ "$files_zipped" -eq "$numfiles" ]; then     echo "Final ZIP..."     echo $file_list | xargs zip -9 zips/$folder_number.zip   fi    if [ "$zip_count" -eq "$div" ]; then     echo "Next Zip..."     echo $file_list | xargs zip zips/$folder_number.zip     let "folder_number=folder_number+1"     zip_count=0     file_list=""   fi  done /code/pre  You can download it here  Once you've downloaded it:  ol liOpen Terminal.app and change to the directory with your photos in it e.g. codecd /path/to/photos/code/li liRun the commmand codebash ~/Downloads/zip50.sh/code (assuming you've downloaded the script to your downloads folder.)/li liA new folder called "zips" will be created in the folder with your photos./li /ol  <comment328578> I tested your script and it appears to work, although you might want to run your script through [http://www.shellcheck.net/](http://www.shellcheck.net/) and see if any of the warnings are worth addressing. <comment328579> Thanks for the suggestion, I am still very new at this.
