Ipad Air 2 work with dac <body> How do you get higher quality streaming from Napster while using Ipad Air 2. I have a dragonfly dac hooked up to the Ipad and it only registers minimum streaming quality while the same dragonfly hooked to a pc shows maximum quality playing the same playlists. I have the IPAD set to best quality streaming and I understand the installed sound processor will only stream at the lower quality but the dac should bypass the organic dac and process at better resolution. There doesn't seem to be any difference in the sound from the ipad headphone jack and the dac.
