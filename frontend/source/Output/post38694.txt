Installing command line GNU utils <body> I've recently started using MacBook Pro with OSX, after years of developing under Ubuntu.  I often use GNU command line tools like codemake/code and codewatch/code. How do I install these on my Mac?  <answer38695> Have a look at these two links:  ul lihttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/1469994/using-make-on-osx (Installing codeXcode/code will also install codemake/code)/li lihttp://osxdaily.com/2010/08/22/install-watch-command-on-os-x//li /ul  <answer38696> codemake/codeis shipped with strongXcode 4/strong.br codewatch/code and others UNIX tools Apple didn't include with OS X are available using strongHomebrew/strong package manager.  emUpdate 17 Feb 2012:/embr Apple added a  new package to their official developer tools suite: Command Line Tools for Xcode.

According to the site, I have to pay 99$/year for a subscription plan. <comment43799> Thanks, the second link solved the `watch` problem. Still no clue on free `GNU make` solution. <comment43800> 99$ is for the subscription to the Mac developer program, you don't need it. Xcode 4 is 5$. Or you can download Xcode 3 which is free. <comment43801> Xcode is free, you don't need to have a developer subscription to use it: *Download Xcode 4.2.1 for Lion from the Mac App Store for Free If you are not an iOS or Mac Developer Program member, you can download Xcode 4.2.1 for Lion from the Mac App Store for free.* <comment45392> In case anyone else comes across this answer: Xcode has been made available for free. You can download it through the Mac App Store at http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id448457090?mt=12
