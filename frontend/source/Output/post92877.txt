ipad mini bought London UK may 2013 <body> I have a house in france, and just charged the ipad mini with a french plug. It blew a fuse. Can I get extra french plugs from Apple for the charger cable??? I bought this french plug from amazon. Not good!  <answer92893> Apple sells the "World Travel Adapter Kit" that includes plugs that will cover the spectrum of countries in the world.
