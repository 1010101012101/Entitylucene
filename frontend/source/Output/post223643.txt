Only display on Thunderbolt works. Camera, audio and USB ports do not <body> Very similar problem as this question, only the display itself is working on the thunderbolt monitor (I only have one, unlike the linked question which had two) with a MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Early 2013). No camera, no audio, no power to USB ports on the display. If I disconnect the thunderbolt display from the MBP, then power does go to the USB ports.   OS X 10.10.5 (14F1509)  (more details below which probably don't amount to much)  This is actually the 2nd Thunderbolt monitor I've had recently. My company exchanged out my previous one, which had similar issues. The prior Thunderbolt was fine, then one day the display would not turn on, attached devices no longer received an active charge. Power would return to USB ports if display was unplugged from the MBP. Then a day or two later, everything went back to working, but the new monitor had already shipped out.  Replacement monitor worked fine the first day, then (of course) the day I shipped back the prior one, started acting consistently as described above - display only, no camera, audio or usb power.   I tried the SMC reset steps (about three times, in case it was sensitive to pressing all 4 keys "at the same time" in just the right way). That hasn't worked.   <answer223653> There is a known similar issue with certain 27' Thunderbolt displays going black, and having connection issues. https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204450   Can you check the firmware version of the Thunderbolt display?   Apple Menu  About this Mac  System Report  Thunderbolt (from left sidebar)  Thunderbolt Display.   The latest firmware version should be 26.2 and the latest Port Micro Firmware Version should be 2.0.7.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZAbZD.png" alt="Thunderbolt Firmware Version in System Report"  <answer277676> I have the opposite problem. My Thunderbolt display used to work fine but now displays only intermittently. However, its sound works fine and the laptop recognizes the monitor. Suspect fluctuating power screws up display; have tried various power cords and they sort-of work, then fail. I have a UPS/surge protection unit on order; have read others' posts and some have reported success with this.   <comment271176> Interesting, didn't know about this.

Like it needs to think about it.  I normally power the laptop with the thunderbolt cable, though it has the older style mag connector, and I have a converter on it. I tried powering the laptop with my more modern plug that has the proper mag connector, but that hasn't mattered either. <comment271749> Darn, in that case the other option I would suspect would be hardware related to your MBP. I have seen similar issues where resetting the NVRAM can help (very similar to an SMC reset) - however if it continues after a reset, it may be specific to the ports. <comment349476> Could you link to some of the other posts you're referring to? <comment349685> Searches for "thunderbolt display black flicker" etc. bring up many Apple forums. Sorry that's not more exact. The Apple Support forum posts where UPS success was mentioned tended to be newer (2015-16) though. Update: my UPS arrived today ... no dice. Have connection, have sound, but no display, just a black screen. I think this monitor is kaput.
