How can I use Gmail as the default mail client app in Mac OS X? <body> I use Gmail as my e-mail client, but when I click on a "mailto:" link, the Mail.app is opened.  Is there a way to avoid the Mail.app opening in this case? Can I open Gmail instead?  <answer3031> If you use Firefox 3.5 or later:  ul liGo to Preferences kbd⌘,/kbd and and choose the Application pane./li liFind "mailto" in the content type list, and choose what you want. If you want Gmail to open, choose it in the popup menu.brbr img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Oim77.jpg" alt="Firefox prefs"/li /ul  Or you can use More Internet, a System Preferences pane that lets you choose which applications are set as helpers for Internet protocols. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/D3TzL.jpg" alt="More Internet"  <answer3034> You could use Mailplane.  Mailplane is a site-specific browser for GMail that offers better OS-level integration.  Mailplane can act as the default email client.  http://mailplaneapp.com/  <answer3039> With Webmailer, you can set up any webmail client as the default email client in OS X.  img src="https://belkadan.com/webmailer/screenshot_sm" alt=""  <answer3061> h2Update (1/2014)/h2  Turns out Google Notifier for Mac is no longer supported.  If you're using strongChrome/strong, this is now very simple: open settings, search for "mailto", and set Gmail as the handler for codemailto/code.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BMmiv.png" alt="enter image description here"  For strongFirefox/strong, see this answer.   (The remainder of this answer is now obsolete.)  hr  While options like Webmailer also do the job, I'll mention yet another way for the sake of completeness:  ol liInstall strongGoogle Notifier for Mac/strong. It's an official Gmail utility strongmade by Google/strong./li liOpen Mail.app, go to Preferences - General, and set "Default email reader" to Google Notifier.app. (Yep, you need to configure this in Mail even when Mail is what you emdon't/em want to use...)/li /ol  img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/2896691/stack/gmail-as-default-email.png" alt="alt text"  Besides directing clicks on emmailto:/em links to Gmail, the Google Notifier comes with some additional features: It adds an icon (like this: img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/2896691/stack/gmail-notifier.png" alt="alt text") in the menu bar and notifies you (if configured to do so) about new mail in your Gmail box. Through the icon you can also access your inbox, unread messages, and "Compose mail" screen quickly.   Works great for me; I can generally vouch for this useful little app.  <answer47478> You could use Sparrow which is a very clean and spare Gmail client. I've been using it for a while and love it.  Go to Mail.app / Preferences / General / and make Sparrow your default email reader.  <answer112624> h2You do NOT need to install a third party app./h2  Both Google Chrome and Firefox support this functionality. (ok, technically these are third party apps, but lets assume you are not using safari.)  h1Chrome:/h1  ol liOpen gmail in chrome. /li liIn the address bar next to the "bookmark star" you should see a grey diamond. Click on the diamond /li liSelect "use gmail". img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/r2PwS.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liIf you do not see the gray diamond, follow the instructions below. /li /ol  strongIf you made a mistake and selected "No" and you really wanted to select "Use Gmail"/strong  ol liWith Chrome open, copy and paste this into your address bar at the top: codechrome://settings/handlers/code/li liUnder the emIgnored protocol handlers/em section, Click on X to the right to delete./li liClose and open Gmail. /li liAnswer the question correctly this time. :)/li /ol  strongSource/strong: http://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/chrome/hnRteY7bHfE  Alternative way, if you need to do this programmatically.  h1Firefox:/h1  See @Am1rr3zA answer on this question. Click here to jump to his answer.   <answer120251> You can do this with Firefox in two steps...  ol liGo to Firefox preferences, Applications, search for mailto: and change the application action to "Use Gmail"./li liFollow Apple's instructions here and choose Firefox as the email app./li /ol  <comment2682> you mean you want open your gmail in browser? <comment2683> @Am1rr3zA, if it's possible, yes. But the most annoying thing is the Mail.app popping up... <comment2697> +1 for MailPlane, it’s really good. Especially if you’re used to Mail.app <comment2703> I agree that while Webmailer gets the job done, this might be the best solution for many users.  Plus, it's made by Google. <comment18760> Thanks to @Guillermo, @jonik below, and the asker. Now I've set-up Google Notifier how do I remove Mail.app from my life? That is, the messages that were downloaded while I was configuring it? I have no need for a local email client. <comment18778> @boehj, you should consider opening a new question about that... <comment18802> @jonik - OK, will do a bit later tonight. Cheers. <comment18869> OK, I put up another question that was [promptly answered](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/17306/how-to-remove-mail-app-data-after-opening-it-to-configure-it-to-not-open-in-the-f). The key to doing this cleanly is to disconnect from the internet before initiating the process. <comment91886> I like this more than the Google Notifier, as it is one less thing cluttering up my icon bar. Note: as of May 2012, development on Webmailer is probably stopping due to the developer getting a job at Apple (source: his blog) <comment104775> This crashes for me in the system preferences panel whenever I try to change the mailto: handler. Webmailer 1.3, OSX 10.8.3 <comment130053> When you set Mailplane as the default email client, then the "Share via email" option in Preview (and iWork, and other apps) disappears: http://mailplaneapp.com/howto/entry/iwork_share_with_email/ <comment131168> Getting crashes if you click anything in the Webmailer prefpane in Mavericks. Since the project is dead now, this doesn't seem like the best answer anymore (unless someone else picks up the source). <comment136635> Google Notifier for Mac is [no longer supported](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/10960?hl=en). Use the instructions for doing it directly in Chrome instead. <comment137451> Actually that page has no instructions regarding `mailto`.  But nevermind, turns out it's now very easy to configure in Chrome (answer updated). <comment213531> now defunct, you can probably delete this answer now <comment282494> Doesn't work.  Aperture still uses Mail. <comment282495> Alas, while this works for mailto: links in the browsers, it does not work for mail from Mac OS applications such as Aperture. <comment282497> More Internet link is broken. <comment287830> I installed extension "mailto:Gmail" before, and, however, this answer is just way much simple and better than it. Thanks very much! <comment293225> This fixed an issue where mailto links were causing Firefox to open an infinite amount of new tabs. My FF settings had Firefox as the mail client, as did OS X. Changing the mailto setting in Firefox to Gmail fixed that.
