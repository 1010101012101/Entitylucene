USB-C to VGA adapter Apple TV 4 <body> Just out of culture: Is it possible to use an USB-C to VGA adapter with the 4th generation Apple-TV by placing the adapter in the USB-C service port?  <answer285613> No.  From AppleInsider: "Unlike with the 12-inch MacBook, which uses the USB-C port for both charging and syncing, the USB-C connection on the Apple TV will only be used for diagnostics purposes."  Also, from AppDevice "The USB-C cable offers the only way for the new Apple TV to interface with a computer for things like taking screenshots of screen recordings from the device and, more important, restoring the device to factory settings via iTunes (in the event that over-the-air restore doesnâ€™t work)."
