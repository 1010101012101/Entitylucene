Racoon - Invalid Major Version 32 <body> I'm playing around with StrongSwan to setup a VPN connection between two mac's on Ubuntu and OSX. I'm having a mac specific problem with racoon. I've tried on four different mac's and half of them are having an error coming from the racoon daemon  precoderacoon[312]: invalid major version 32. /code/pre  This seams to happen after ikev2_init[I] messages is sent. I'm able to receive a response ikev2_init[R] but the tunnel is never created successfully.  This has happened on macs running Yosemite and Mavericks.   How do I check the version of racoon / fix this problem?  Here is my racoon.conf from working machine (never edited)  precode# $KAME: racoon.conf.in,v 1.17 2001/08/14 12:10:22 sakane Exp $  # "path" must be placed before it is used. # You can overwrite what you defined, but it should not be used due to confusion. path include "/etc/racoon" ;  # search this file for pre_shared_key with various ID key. path pre_shared_key "/etc/racoon/psk.txt" ;  # racoon will look for certificate file in the directory, # if the certificate/certificate request payload is received. path certificate "/etc/cert" ;  # "log" specifies logging level.

I stumbled to this by accident, having the same Racoon error with Strongswan.   Try switching off codeBack to my Mac/code if that is enabled in your codeSystem Preferences &gt; iCloud/code. This did the trick for me. The error disappeared and VPN connections started working again.  <answer295311> This cryptic message means the racoon daemon process received a message and rejected it based upon the version number detected in the packet.  Usually this means the remote/client/peer sent a IPSEC-version 2 message and the racoon daemon process can only handle IPSEC-version 1 messages.  The workaround is to initiate the IPSEC connection with a IPSEC (version 1) request.  <comment205810> Nope never figured it out, but I'll give that a try and report back. Thanks for the heads up <comment218602> I realize this is months late but I did confirm today this was the issue. Thanks! <comment290823> Do you need to reboot your mac or anything for this to work?
