Can you view the copy progress in terminal? <body> I was copying files and while doing that, I thought whether it is possible to see copying information and speed in the terminal?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pjNQ8.png" alt="enter image description here"  I have already tried codersync/code but it's failed to show me anything, probably because the code$SRC/code is at a server.
