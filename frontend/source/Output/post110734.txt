My mac came with Mountain Lion. I upgraded to mavericks - and now I can't find mountain lion download <body> According to I&#39;ve bought Mountain Lion, but where can I download it now? it should be in my purchase tab, but it isn't. ("option" does not help, it just lets you redownload if it is already in the list - which it isn't)  I would like an installable version of Mountain Lion to run inside parallels for testing software I develop against 10.8 (and potentially also 10.7, but let's stick to 10.8 for now).   How can I get an installer for older versions?  hr  edit: found a way (for some reason site won't let me post this as an answer)  Use "Internet Recovery" (option-R during boot), and install Mountain Lion into an external USB drive. Then get parallels to import that. Awkward, but it works.  <answer110741> You might just download a torrent for Mountain Lion. OS X doesn't have any copy protection. You can create a VM from the dmg included with the installer application (codeInstall OS X Mountain Lion.app/Contents/SharedSupport/InstallESD.dmg/code), so don't download any modified ISOs meant for PCs.  <answer113292> For some reason which remains unexplained, the App Store 'Hides' the Mountain Lion purchase once Mavericks has been downloaded. The Lion purchase remains visible, but Mountain Lion becomes 'Hidden.'  Fire up strongApp Store/strong and go to strongPurchases/strong. Now go to the strongStore/strong menu and select strongView my Account/strong - enter your password when asked. Go to the 2nd Section strongiTunes in the Cloud/strong and click on strongManage/strong - You'll find strongMountain Lion/strong in the list.  <comment130430> Thanks, but I don't want any hacker trojan installed in them (I want only Apple/NSA endorsed ones :) ). Is there a way to download it from Apple?
