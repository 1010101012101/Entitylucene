Can't delete manually added static route <body> On Mountain Lion, I manually added a static route like this:  precode$ sudo route -n add 10.10.10.1/24 10.0.0.2 add net 10.10.10.1: gateway 10.0.0.2 /code/pre  That worked just fine. Now I want to remove the static route, but this fails:  precode$ sudo route -n delete  10.10.10.1/24 10.0.0.2 route: writing to routing socket: not in table delete net 10.10.10.1: gateway 10.0.0.2: not in table /code/pre  Even though it says "not in table", the entry is there, according to netstat and route:  precode$ netstat -rn | grep 10.10.10 10.10.10/24        10.0.0.2           UGSc            1        2    tap0  $ route get 10.10.10.1    route to: 10.10.10.1 destination: 10.10.10.0        mask: 255.255.255.0     gateway: 10.0.0.2   interface: tap0       flags: &lt;UP,GATEWAY,DONE,STATIC,PRCLONING&gt;  recvpipe  sendpipe  ssthresh  rtt,msec    rttvar  hopcount      mtu     expire        0         0         0         0         0         0      1500         0 /code/pre  What's going wrong here?  Edit: My local interface on the 10.0.0.1/24 network is a tap device created by OpenVPN. Stopping the OpenVPN client clears the route. Would still like to know why I can't remove this route without stopping the VPN client.  <answer102389> I was using the wrong syntax. This works:  precode$ sudo route -n delete 10.10.10.0 /code/pre  <comment120204> `man openvpn` and look at all the --route* options?
