What is the default URL for Software Update on OS X 10.5.x? <body> I am fixing my mother-in-law's computer, and when I ran software update I found that the computer was looking to https://storeserver.local:8088/indes.sucatalog to get it's updates...   Clearly she has brought this machine to the Apple Store for some help at some point.  What is the correct URL for OS X 10.5 to get updates directly from Apple?  I know how to set the URl using:  precodedefaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.SoftwareUpdate CatalogURL "_insert_correct_url_here" /code/pre  Thanks for your help in advance.  Bill  <answer73617> I still don't know what the proper URL is, but I did find that if I enter   precodedefaults delete com.apple.SoftwareUpdate CatalogURL /code/pre  it deletes the bad entry by the Apple Store folks and allows me to get an enormous list of updates that need to be done.  I will still pursue the correct URL, and whomever answers that will get the credit.  <answer73628> The link below will take you to a page for multiple 10.5 combo  updates  http://support.apple.com/downloads/#os%2010.5%20combo%20updates  the link below is for 10.5.8 combo update  http://support.apple.com/kb/DL866  <answer73651> Resetting the catalog should have reset it to the default apple software update server.  But it should be swscan.apple.com if memory serves me.
