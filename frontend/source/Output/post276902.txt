Account locked, cant reset password <body> So I got an email in the middle of the night last night that someone used my apple ID to log into an iphone 6... I haven't had an iphone for about a year and haven't really paid much attention to my account since then...  So I went to the apple id site to reset my password just to make sure everything is good, but it won't let me says that they can't process it the request right now...  However when I try to log into icloud it tells me that the account has been locked....but once again I am able to unlock it because "the request can't be processed right now"  Any suggestions?  <comment348577> There are several questions on this already on the site (see Related at right or use the search function).
