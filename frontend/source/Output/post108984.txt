Free media player with jump-to-specific-time option for big mp3 files <body> I'm listening to some mp3 files, some of them lasting 5 hours or more, and I'm looking for a player which allows to jump directly to a specific point in time in the mp3 file.  VLC has an option "jump to time" but it's buggy, it doesn't do anything or just hangs the app. Each time I reopen any player I've tried so far, I have to guess and click the time progress bar trying to find where I left.  <answer108985> Are you aware of iTunes' option to remember the play position in a file? Right-click on any track (or select it and press kbdCmd-I/kbd) to open it.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ykhJ3.png" alt="Get Info"  <answer110090> You could assign a shortcut to a script like this:  precodeset text item delimiters to ":" display dialog "" default answer "" set ti to text items of text returned of result if number of ti is 1 then     item 1 of ti else if number of ti is 2 then     60 * (item 1 of ti) + (item 2 of ti) else if number of ti is 3 then     3600 * (item 1 of ti) + 60 * (item 2 of ti) + (item 3 of ti) end if tell application "iTunes" to set player position to result /code/pre  Or install ffmpeg with codebrew install ffmpeg --with-afplay/code and use a command like codeffplay -ss 1:23:45 file.mp3/code.  I also use scripts like this to change the playback position with the keyboard:  precodetry     tell application "iTunes"         if player position &lt; 15 then             previous track         else             set player position to player position - 15         end if     end tell end try /code/pre    precodetry     tell application "iTunes"         set player position to player position + 15     end tell end try /code/pre  <comment128620> I can't find that option in iTunesPreferencesplayback or any other tab in iTunes 11.1.3 <comment128621> @rraallvv It's available by right-clicking an item in iTunes and selecting Get Info (or by selecting an item and pressing âŒ˜I) and going to the Options tab.
