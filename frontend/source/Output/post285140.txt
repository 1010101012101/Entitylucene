iMac maximum CPU fans rpm is too low <body> Firstly, I don't know to use iMac well â€“ I'm new to the business. Anyway, the Mac was making too much noise, that's why I came here. The CPU was running 3200rpm and I think the maximum rpm was approximately 5500 rpm. And I reset SMC fan control to the default settings. But now, the maximum CPU fan rpm is 2100 rpm and I think it's too low. I use this iMac for rendering. So it's a problem, what should I do?   While the iMac is running idle: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JtRRx.png" alt="enter image description here"  and if I render, the CPU core becomes approximately 65-70C.
