Itunes 12.2 format playlist as songs not working <body> I am aware that there is supposed to be a little dropdown in the upper, right-hand corner of Itunes that allows one to change the format of a playlist. However, my Itunes looks like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8EYum.png" alt="enter image description here"  How do I get my formatting dropdown back?  <answer252580> With iTunes 12, playlists can be displayed as a Playlist (your current setting and it seems to be the default), or as Songs, Albums, Artists, Composers or Genres. Change the setting from the menu bar at codeView-&gt;View As/code, or use kbdâŒ˜/kbdkbdJ/kbd to open codeShow View Options/code.  There is no dropdown for the how playlists are viewed.  <comment314500> Thanks! Cmd + J worked perfectly!
