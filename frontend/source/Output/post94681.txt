What happens if the Internet connection goes down during a Lion Internet Recovery? <body> I am restoring Lion on my MacBook before selling it and I am doing it through the Internet Recovery option. After starting the process, the Internet connection went down a couple of times and, after this happening, the blue progress bar jumped to the end, so I don't know the exact percentage.  Do you know what happens in this case? Does the download resume from where it left or does it start from the beginning?  <answer94684> For a short interruption, you can expect the download to resume. I might choose to power it off and start over since you might end up with a corrupt package that the OS will not install and a cryptic error message. Worse, the install may stall and you could wait a long time before giving up.  It's in your interest to get the installation over a fast internet connection (perhaps a local Apple Store) so that you don't have to do it over or wait so long in the end.  <comment110987> The problem is not really the speed of the connection as much as its stability. I am afraid that if I start over again it might crash again...
