Creating an Automator/Applescript to compare two versions of an MS Word document <body> I'm storing MS Word documents in GIT and would like to have an rudimentary document compare system on the rare occasion that I need to diff them. I've seen: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3292792/git-or-hg-plugin-for-dealing-with-microsoft-word-and-or-openoffice-files and have tried all the solutions mentioned there including Araxis Merge. However at best I get text comparison. Since MS Word exposes Compare Docs as an automator command this should be possible.  My goal: an automator workflow or applescript that can be fired from the command line that fires up MS word and compares two versions of a document.
