Cannot add gmail account on iOS <body> I am trying to add a gmail account to my iPad in order to have contacts, email, and calendar sync.  I go to Settings - Mail - Accounts - Add Account and enter my gmail credentials.  It accepts the credentials and then goes to this screen: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zeWjL.png" alt="post authentication screen"  The spinner to the left of Gmail will spin for about 20 seconds then it just takes me back to this screen: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qqPeH.png" alt="add account screen"  The account never gets added.  I get an email on my phone that says "new sign in from iPad" so I know the authentication is working.  I am using iOS 10.2.   The same problem existed in 10.0.2.  Some users have reported that doing this process over 4g rather than WiFi works, but this is a WiFi only device.  The gmail app is installed and logs me in just fine.  The same thing happens on both my 2 factor authentication account and my account without 2FA.  <answer275629> I had this problem too.  When I checked on google if there was a security issue (https://myaccount.google.com/device-activity) I noticed that my iphone location was overseas.  I then realised that iPhone was connected to my company wifi and was routed via their overseas hub.  So I disabled the wifi so that only the local mobile data was being used.   After that the add mail  google then worked.
