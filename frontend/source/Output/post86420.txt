What is the maximum amount of file arguments I can pass to a command? <body> If I do this in OS X, what is the maximum amount of files I can test?  Or is there a maximum length for this string?  precodedo shell script "md5 -q 'path/to/file1.txt' 'path/to/file2.txt'" /code/pre  <answer86421> This will find all of the visible files within the folder.  precodeset myFolder to POSIX path of (choose folder) set myData to (do shell script "find " &amp; quoted form of myFolder &amp; " \\! -name \".*\" -type f -print0 | xargs -0 md5 -q") /code/pre  <answer86423> codegetconf ARG_MAX/code, or currently 262144 bytes.  If you get an argument list too long eror, try using find:  precodefind . -type f -exec md5 -q {} \+ /code/pre  code-exec md5 {} \+/code and code-print0 | xargs -0 md5/code pass multiple arguments to md5, so they are usually faster than code-exec md5 {} \;/code.  <comment99848> Thanks  I know nothing about unix. I have this old code which i copied somewhere and it needs tweaking (or tweaking of your code samples): do shell script "find -x " & my_path & " -print0 | xargs -0 ls -d -F -P -l -T -a -e -i -o -p -q " & my_path user name "user" password "pin" with administrator privileges  Above code still don't get creation date & time.  My ultimate goal is log with information below & number of Finder label & md5 & Finder comment, something like this: "46737077 drwxr-xr-x  2 Jonas   68 Oct  4 15:39:34 2012 /Users/Jonas/Desktop/test/test.txt 5 md5_here finder_comment_here" <comment99937> @clueless5 Maybe it's better to ask a new question for this specific topic and include the goal of the command or what you want to accomplish as well. The comment section is not a good place for such things.
