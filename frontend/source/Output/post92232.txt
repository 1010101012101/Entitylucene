My SD card slot doesn't work <body> My SD card slot on the latest MacBook (Mid 2012) won't mount my SD card. The SD card doesn't appear in Finder, Disk Utility, Image Capture or anywhere. I know it's not a software problem, because nothing changed before and after. How do I fix it?  <answer92233> This thread says that there's a switch in the SD card slot that detects when a card is inserted, and it can get clogged by dust or jammed or something. If you play around with a toothpick (or anything that fits in that hole), it'll fix your problem. Toggling that switch helps.  <answer101202> I blew hard in the SD card hub. Now it is working fine.  <answer104541> for me sticking the SD card in and pulling it a bit out again ( just a few mm ) seems to get it mounted.  There's even a video that explains how to put it in and pull it out a bit here   But I find that putting it in under an angle works better: Sticking the card in under a angle with the cut off corner against the top of the SD slot and then pushing the card in seems to get it mounted every time.  <answer119060> My Mac book stop seeing the cards, I used  a can of air to clean out the reader and it works fine now.  <answer119598> Maybe some dust is stuck in the card slot. To remove, gently blow into the slot and try to insert the card again.  <comment108230> So your issue is fixed? <comment108240> Yeah. I only commented because it was a hard bug to find, and much prefer Stack Exchange over some random forum. <comment139530> Could you be slightly more specific. <comment163772> Blowing compressed air into the SD slot on 2 of my MacBook Pros solved the problem. Thanks for that tip. I had tried everything else. <comment193732> +1 for sticking it in under and angle: works reliable up to this point. <comment236322> -1 for how ridiculous it is that you pay a premium for this hardware and then have to stuff like that <comment255170> Wow.  That worked!  I guess we're back to the days of the NES. <comment331329> I can't post a new answer because of the protected status of the question.  For me, blowing into the slot didn't work.  I spoke to Apple support who suggested resetting NVRAM and SMC, and this does seem to have helped. In particular, it seems to be the SMC reset that helped. <comment331826> @PeterT Please make an edit to the main answer with your details - I will approve that addition if someone else doesn't do it before I see the edit. <comment331841> Actually, I think I was just lucky the first time I tried after the SMC reset.  The problem was always intermittent, and I guess likely more related to dust etc after all. <comment355360> under and angle worked for me too!!! Thanks :) <comment373094> Are you freakin' kidding me? How the heck did this work... I can confirm that this fixed the issue...
