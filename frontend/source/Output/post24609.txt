Remapping keyboard shortcuts in Chrome and Firefox <body> I recently switched from Windows to Mac.  One of the things that's really ingrained in my muscle memory is hitting kbdAlt/kbd+kbdD/kbd in a browser to go to the address bar.  On Mac browsers, kbd⌘/kbd+kbdD/kbd creates a bookmark, the equivalent to move to the address bar is kbd⌘/kbd+kbdL/kbd.    I've used the Keyboard pref pane to remap kbd⌘/kbd+kbdD/kbd to the "Open Location..." command in Safari, Chrome, and Firefox.  In Safari this works great.  In both Chrome and Firefox, hitting kbd⌘/kbd+kbdD/kbd now goes to the address bar strongand/strong creates a bookmark.  Is there any way to get this to work properly in Chrome and Firefox?  Mac OS 10.7, Chrome 13.0.782.220, Firefox 6.0.2  <answer24645> ShortcutManager (Chrome extension) allows you to:     Customize shortcut keys; Assign any Javascript code or browser actions to any key strokes.   Here's an article on remapping keyboard shortcuts for Firefox. You'll need the keyconfig extension.  <answer24653> Chris,  You can achieve this using the keyboard prefs just as you were trying. You simply need to create one more shortcut.  In Chrome you would:  ul liSet kbdCommand/kbd-kbdD/kbd to codeOpen Location.../code/li liSet kbdCommand/kbd-kbdL/kbd to codeBookmark This Page.../code/li /ul  By setting an explicit shortcut for codeBookmark This Page.../code you get rid of the conflict an ensure there aren't two menu options with the same shortcut.  <answer264003> Unfortunately none of the extensions I have work. However, there is a way to do this in the version of OSX I'm using, at least. Go to Settings-Keyboard-Shortcuts, and then from the list on the left select "App Shortcuts". Click "+" to add a new app shortcut and then select Google Chrome from the list of Apps.  Now, you must assign "Bookmark This Page..." to something else first so that you can truly override command+D. I chose to select shift+command+B.  After that click "+" again, and assign "Open Location..." to command+D. Now it should work.  I can't believe how long it took me to find this answer, I guess everyone else uses Alt+L or Firefox. Thanks to Pysis for their answer here.  Edit: This was so frustrating I made an account just to respond to this.  <comment76141> Could someone extend this answer for dummies, please? I'm not sure where this Keyboard prefs page is. Is this System Preferences  Keyboard? If so, I added Google Chrome and the shortcuts mentioned above and relaunched Chrome but the shortcut actions did not change. <comment76142> I figured it out. My browser was not in English. :) <comment205515> This extension is useless on OS X. Let's say I try to add a shortcut Ctrl+t to open a new tab. The extension refuses to do that, and says that shortcut is already assigned to do open a new tab. That may be the case on other platforms, but not on OS X. The whole reason I want to add this shortcut in the first place is to map the action on the same keys as on other platforms. <comment286580> Another way that this extension fails is that pressing "Command" produces META+META, so "Command + 1" doesn't produce the desired result. The answer by @Samuel Mikel Bowles solves the problem. <comment301196> it took me a moment to find, even today under El Capitan. it's under System Preference  Keyboard  Shortcuts. adding and removing shortcuts is done using the *unlabeled* plus and minus below the shortcuts list.
