constant zoom in the Photos app on Mac when switching between photos <body> I am playing with Photos app on my Mac and I would like to have fixed zoom while switching between photos. This is the option in Photos app:    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kU7Mn.png" alt="enter image description here"  Right now, it jumps to 0% every time I switch to another photo. I would like to have it fixed all the time. Any idea how can I achieve this?   <answer250711> Sorry, there is no option to lock the zoom in the Photo app. You will need another app to achieve that effect.
