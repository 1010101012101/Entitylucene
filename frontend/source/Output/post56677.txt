iCal: How to display full event title? <body> I am new to Mac, Mac OS X and iCal.  In the monthly view of iCal, I found it very inconvenient to read only the first 10-12 characters of an event's title. To read the full length title, I have to do one of the following:  ul ligo to full screen/li lireduce font size to "unreadable"/li liopen the event edit dialog/li ligo to the daily view/li /ul  None of the above options satisfies me.  Is there a way to have iCal display additional info (full title, comments...) when mouse stay over an event for one second or so?  Alternatively, is there a way to make a long ( 10 chars) title wrap to a new line rather than being cut with code.../code?  <answer56692> What MACOSX Version are you using? Because in Lion 10.7.4 using iCal on Monthly view, you just need to click the event and it will pop up all event description.  <answer56859> There are many threads (on other forums) asking about the title wrapping, but I'm afraid it isn't possible. For reference, I found this, this, and this.  <comment65117> Sure, this is what I listed as "open the edit dialog", but then you have to click once again to close the description. I was actually looking for something with no click at all, instead of 2 clicks. I received a brand new MacBook Air just one week ago, so I assume I use the very latest version of Lion. <comment65290> The short answer is no, you've listed the only possible ways <comment65291> There are many threads (on other forums) asking about the title wrapping, but I'm afraid it isn't possible.
