How to register an AppleScript as a potential default web browser? <body> I've written an AppleScript that I want to set as the default browser.  I've added a codeCFBundleDocumentTypes/code section to the p-list (copied from Safari) and rebuilt the launch services database, but that didn't work.  The script doesn't show up in the Safari default browser list. If I choose it manually in that preferences dialog, it's ignored, and Safari becomes the default browser.  <answer33277> Have you tried adding the codeCFBundleURLTypes/code and the sub-key codeLSIsAppleDefaultForScheme/code?  precode&lt;key&gt;CFBundleURLTypes&lt;/key&gt; &lt;array&gt;     &lt;dict&gt;         &lt;key&gt;CFBundleURLName&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;string&gt;Web site URL&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;key&gt;CFBundleURLSchemes&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;array&gt;             &lt;string&gt;http&lt;/string&gt;             &lt;string&gt;https&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;/array&gt;         &lt;key&gt;LSIsAppleDefaultForScheme&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;true/&gt;     &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/array&gt; /code/pre  Not sure that it will help, but I have noticed these keys in the info.plist of all the apps that I have checked that show up in that browser list.  <comment38040> Yes, it looks like that was the main thing I was missing. I found this article which specifically addresses the issue: http://www.macosautomation.com/applescript/linktrigger/index.html
