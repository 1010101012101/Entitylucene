Auto-completing words in any program <body> I am looking for a program running on Mac OS X that allows the user to auto-complete words in any program.  For example, if the user types codesoft/code, the program could suggest codesoftware/code or codesoften/code in a dropbown menu, similarly to the auto-completion feature present in most IDEs:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YhKLR.png" alt="enter image description here"  Ideally:  ul lithe program should allow the user to view the auto-completion options by using a keyboard shortcut./li lithe options given by the program are listed by likelihood (e.g., using some language model)/li lithe program could be disabled in some programs./li /ul  Any price or license is fine.  hr  I have crossposted the question at:  ul lihttp://qr.ae/TbWFBy/li lihttps://redd.it/6a6bas/li /ul  <answer283155> The Touch Bar integrates word prediction similar to iOS, which provides you with three word suggestions as you type. Tap a word to insert it. The more you type, the more the words filter. The screenshot shows when a new sentence is being started — type and the predictions finish your word.     img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eWqSD.png" alt=""   Use the Touch Bar on your MacBook Pro  ul liTouch Bar word prediction is available by choosing View → Customise Touch Bar and enabling "Show typing suggestions" if they are not already available.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OH4sp.png" width="422"/li liThe options are listed with the most commonly used word in the middle and other common alternatives either side./li liYou can disable word prediction by tapping the › button on the left of the suggestions./li /ul
