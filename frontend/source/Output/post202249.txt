Is there a way to recover pictures from a destroyed iPad? <body> An iPad mini from a friend was ran over by a car and it is completely non nonfunctional. I tried to connect it to charger to see if it was draining current but it is completely dead. There are some pictures on the iPad that I would have liked to recover. Is there a way to get back the files in such situation?   I'm thinking more of a hardware way, maybe by disconnecting the flash memory and using it in another device.   I Googled it but every article I found involved a partly functional iPad that could be connected to USB.   The iPad was never synced to iTune nor connected to iCloud.  <comment243912> The memory in the iPad cannot be read in this fashion you describe.  It sounds like you are out of luck. <comment243930> @Ramhound - can't? I wouldn't say that. It's more like "if the ssd (flash chip) isn't broken, the expertise required to read its data will cost far more than you are likely willing to pay." <comment243947> Thanks for migrating my question this SE site. I was not aware of its existence.
