iOS10 "wake up" on "older" iPhones <body> My iPhone is all of 2 years old, an iPhone 6 (not "s") and as a result it doesn't have the magic Raise to Wake feature. At least so I understand.  As a result getting it on and authenticated takes TWO presses of the button plus one to authenticate my finger.  ol liPress home once: Screen lights up and says "press home to unlock"/li liPress home again: Displays passcode or TouchID/li liTouch home button to authenticate/li /ol  This is one click more than iOs 9. And each and every time I use my phone.   Is there a way around this?  <answer250209> Raise to wake; No.  hr  Unlock and go to the home screen with one press; Yes.  ol liSettings/li liGeneral/li liAccessibility/li liHome Button/li liRest Finger to Open  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/db6Rg.jpg" alt="Image of Rest Finger to Open setting in Public iOS 10 beta 6"/li /ol  <comment310554> Interesting... because of the massive speed increase from my 5S to 6S, if I ever want to see if I have any notifications on my lock screen, I've had to teach myself to not hit Home with an "authorised finger" or it just skips straight past & into the springboard - very irritating indeed. 3 actions do seem a bit much, but it feels like they're moving in the right direction, for me. <comment310559> I also have a 6. All you need to do is press the home button once and don't lift your finger. You don't need to remove it and replace it for TouchID to kick off. <comment310561> Interesting @StephenCollins. It works but I have to hold my finger still for what seems like 2 seconds. An eternity. <comment310566> @StephenCollins - that's how my 6S currently works, press, release-but-don't-let-go-entirely - Tadahh, springboard. ..but too fast if you want to see notifications. <comment310608> Beautiful! Thanks for finding that. Useful for everyone not just accessibility users!!! <comment310609> By the way whoever down voted it. Why? It was a good question and now we have a valuable answer! <comment310733> I'm happy to have been able to help :)
