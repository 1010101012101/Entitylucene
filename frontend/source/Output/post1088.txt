Defer Sending Email using Mail.app <body> I'm curious, does anybody have a decent solution for sending e-mails via Mail.app at some scheduled times? I'm badly in need of something like that :)  <answer1090> I believe that you don’t consider Deferrersender (web based) to be decent. It’s not, but it delivers.   strongUPDATE/strong: An alternative, that doesn’t use Mail.app (but Thunderbird) would be to use SendLater. An extension that does exactly that. But it’s for Thunderbird. I couldn’t find a similar plug-in for Mail.app.  <answer1095> You can use Apple scripts to setup mail app schedule mail via iCal  http://homepage.mac.com/aamann/Mail_Scripts.html  Or use web based service as Martin said  http://www.lettermelater.com/  <comment924> Tried Mail Scrips already, scheduled sending from drafts but they failed to send the e-mails... do you personally use Mail Scrips? <comment925> Not an option ... sorry <comment961> I dont use mailscripts, but for testing I download and test it. It works for me. Make sure you save message as draft  Make sure the "mailscripts" calendar has been created in iCal  Make sure you've save message as draft and schedule delivery event appears in ical "mail scripts"  Your computer need to be running when event in iCal time. If not, messages will be sent as soon as your computer turn on next time. Tested software: OS Mac OS X 10.6.4 Mail app 4.3 (1081)
