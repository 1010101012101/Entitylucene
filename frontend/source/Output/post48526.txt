Security continues to ask for password after sleep or screensaver <body> In Lion, I repeatedly uncheck the option to Require a Password after Sleep or Screen Saver Begins in Sys Prefs Security Privacy General but when I return to wake the computer, it requires a password and the option is re-checked even thought I have locked the page.  This is on a iMac 20".  I have a Macbook pro with lion and it does not behave the same way.  Any fixes?   <comment55578> Do you by chance have FileVault 2 enabled on your iMac?
