How can I change the white balance eyedropper sample size in Aperture 3.6? <body> In previous versions of Aperture, it was possible to change the size of the area sampled by the white balance eyedropper: in the gear menu at the top of the Adjustments section, I could select 1x1, 3x3, 5x5, etc. sample sizes, and this would be reflected in the size of the square shown in the loupe (if loupe magnification was at least 200%).  In Aperture 3.6, the gear menu is gone (replaced with the Auto Enhance button) and the white balance eyedropper appears to be fixed at 3x3 pixels.  Is there a way to change it?  If so, how?
