Map windows printer by name doesn't work, by IP does, buy why? <body> Using Mac OSX 10.9, adding a printer using Advanced, "Windows printer using spoolss", smb://servername/sharename does not work.  The servername is resolvable, but is using a different subnet than the client.  When I use an IP instead of a name, it works.  All I'm wondering is why it works with an IP, but not a name.  The server is a Windows Server 2008 R2 Enterprise. The client is not added in any domain.  <comment152499> Is your mac configured to be in the same workgroup as the server? <comment152939> No, the server is configured as a domain controller, the client uses simply "workgroup"
