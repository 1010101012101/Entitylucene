configure multiple networks with static and dhcp ip addresses <body> At work I'd like to be able to use a codestatic ip/code over wifi for development purposes. At home however, since I'm on a different network I don't want to use a static ip, but codedhcp/code. On codeOSX 10.8/code, how can I configure this in a way that I don't have to manually change over each time I switch networks?  <answer98032> Configure separate network Locations.  ol liOn the Network pane in System Preferences, use the Location pop-up menu to create a new location name./li liPress the + (plus) button to create a new location./li liClick the Done button./li liClick the Apply button in the Network pane./li /ol  You can now configure and select separate network locations via the drop down in the Network pane.  <comment115039> Awesome, never even noticed that feature before. Thanks <comment115070> I found this which seems to do what I'm looking for: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/locations-3/id437317622?mt=12 <comment172877> This is an elegant solution with Mac but I still love iOS's network configuration per network. That's something we really want!
