Any practical way to mount Amazon Cloud Drive as network volume on Mac? <body> Need to mount strongAmazon Cloud Drive/strong as a desktop network volume. I've tried ExpanDrive, but it's so slow as to be useless. It also completely freezes up Finder every few seconds.  I also saw acd_fuse but not sure how to install it ... through Python? Homebrew? Is it reliable?  <comment314815> The original docs of for the product can be done on the GCA. See link. https://code.google.com/archive/p/pyamazonclouddrive/ -- this may help. <comment342019> Check out this [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/3uj5v4/experienced_amazon_cloud_drive_users_tips_useful/) for an overview of options. I have been using ACD mainly for backups with Arq by now, but mounting with ExpanDrive Version 5.4.5 (5.4.5.0) seemed to work fine as well and quite speedy - maybe you wanna give it another try? <comment342020> In that [reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/3uj5v4/experienced_amazon_cloud_drive_users_tips_useful/) others have reported 50 MBytes per second when using multiple threads with acd_cli `acdcli upload -x 10 folder/`
