Where can I find an iPhone 4S skin image? <body> We need to build a static web page with an iPhone on it containing animated views to showcase our app. To start with we need an iPhone 4S skin, better to be a white one to hold the rest of images, so I was wondering where can we find such skin. Can anyone help?  <answer54328> I got one by launching the iOS simulator from Xcode and taking a screenshot:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/G1SSw.png" alt="iPhone simulator"  <answer54335> By snooping around in the iPhone simulator app bundle, i came up with this in code/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/Applications/iPhone Simulator.app/Contents/Resources//code:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ouxyJ.png" alt="enter image description here"  It's higher quality, already has the middle (screen area) cleared out, and the aforementioned folder even includes a sprite for the pressed home button
