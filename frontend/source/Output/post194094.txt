Insecure connection and stored passwords disappear <body> I am troubleshooting my dad's computer and I am confused about what's going on, sorry if the symptoms are a little bit all over the place.   I am connecting the computer with a wifi that all other computers seem to have no problem with.  On his computer I have the following trouble and the following symptoms:  ol liWebbrowser: trying to open "https://google.de" claims to be an insecure connection. /li liDropbox also cannot connect because it is supposed to be an insecure connection/li liMail asks for passwords that it previously remembered. They also still seem to be stored in keychain./li liEvery now and then the computer seems to also forget the wifi password and I have to manually enter it./li liA weird dialog pops up rapidly and then quickly closes by itself. I had to try a few times by taking a screenshot to capture what it says. It is saying (roughly translated from German): "Do you want 'nmblookup' to accept incoming connections"/li /ol  The Mac is running OS Version 10.6.8  <answer194095> Ok, so it seem like that by going into "Disk Utility" and doing the sequence "Verify Disk Permissions"-"Repair Disk Permission" did the trick.   <comment231442> What is to stop the permissions going wrong and getting the same problems? the fix here might not work for long <comment231444> @Mark: I am also not 100% satisfied with this solution. Do you have any suggestions on how to troubleshoot this? <comment231445> First - which files had the wrong permissions and what were they changed to - Second which process did the chnage
