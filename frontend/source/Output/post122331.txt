Can I get the ipsw file off my iPhone 3gs and install it on my iPhone 4s? <body> I still have my old iPhone 3gs (AT&amp;T) with iOS 6. I have a back up of it as well. I also have a iPhone 4s (Sprint) with iOS 7.  Can I grab the ipsw file off my iPhone 3gs and install it on my iPhone 4s?   I will not install any ipsw from the net. It is not worth the risk of getting an infected or spyware file.   <answer122332> No, even if you obtained the IPSW, it would not install since there are different IPSWs for different devices.  You can check the authenticity of an IPSW per this question:  ul liCan an .ipsw firmware restore image&#39;s origin be verified?/li /ul  <answer122799> Here is a reputable website that gives a lot of information about each IPSW, and it gives you the direct link to the file on Apple's servers for each one. Famous jailbreakers @icj_ and @iH8sn0w run the website.  http://www.icj.me/ios/all  <comment145311> Thank You. I am reluctant to use any file not from apple itself. <comment145312> I was afraid of that. Thank You <comment145460> Welcome to Ask Different!
