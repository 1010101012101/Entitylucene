Buzzing in bass with multi-output device <body> I've set up a multi-output device between my Bluetooth speaker and another output device (doesn't actually matter what device).  As long as the Bluetooth device (MagicBox II) is one of the chosen devices, I get a nasty buzzing in the low end, primarily following the kick drum.  It sounds a bit like this question, but may not be exactly the same... I'm not sure.  And there is no answer on that question at this time.  The BT speaker alone does not exhibit this issue, nor does any combination of devices that does not include the BT speaker.  The issue only arises when the BT speaker emand/em a hardware device are chosen together.  Also the buzzing always comes from whichever is the last device to have been added, it is not exclusive to the BT speaker.  What could be causing this and how can I eliminate it?  <comment250063> Additionally, this does not appear to be specific to the Bluetooth device used.  I just tried with a completely different make/model of BT speaker and got the identical end result.
