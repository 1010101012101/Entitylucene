my macbook air got heated even after I changed it's fan? <body> My macbook air 13 mid 2011 keep heating and reach 90 degree I've changed it's fan as I thought it not giving the right coolness for it, but still got heated ? what else might cause this heat issue ?  <comment287293> What component is specifically reaching 90 degrees? What is the ambient temperature in the room and is the air placed on a hard surface, not closed clamshell and has proper bumpers on the bottom case cover? <comment287461> Depending on the component, this could be normal. You could use something like [smcfancontrol](https://www.eidac.de) to increase the fan speed to try and keep it cool, but it may not help. Also, let's clear up if this is 90ºC or 90ºF. <comment288223> here's a screenshot for all component temperatures when it reaches 92ºC  http://i.imgur.com/Hyh4BDh.png <comment289352> Have you tried reinstalling the operating system, and/or cleaning inside of your computer with compressed air?
