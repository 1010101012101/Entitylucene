Why doesn't my iPod Classic show all the songs it holds? <body> I recently bought a new iPod Classic 120GB, mainly to use on my Numark iDJ2 but also for general use.  I have it set so that all my iTunes songs are automatically pulled over to it and when I look at its contents on iTunes all my songs are there. However, if I unplug it and then search through it manually, some artists don't appear. (I haven't yet found a pattern.)  The only reason I mention my iDJ2 is that I have Numark's 'Librarian' software installed on my iPod so that the iDJ2 can categorize and play all of my songs. I don't see how it should be responsible for this problem though.  Any help much appreciated and let me know if you need any more info.  <answer10897> Could it be that some albums are tagged as "strongCompilation/strong"? In this case the artists in these albums are not shown in the "emArtists/em" submenu... Uncheck the "strongCompilation/strong" check-box (or something like that - I don't use iTunes!) in the emInformation tab/em and they magically appear in the list.  PS. When you select an artist that "has" a proper album, the songs in the strongCompilation albums/strong are also shown.  <comment11402> No matter how funny you think Weird Al is, your iPod just doesn't want to play it. <comment11403> Always the same few artistes? Sample artistes names?
