iPhone/iOS Caching Issue <body> Okay, here is what I am experiencing. I am building a mobile app with HTML/CSS/JS, and testing it mostly on iPhone before porting to app store with phonegap. But, I am having caching problems when I go into the app (I've added it to my iPhone with the "Add to home screen" feature). It doesn't show the last saved updates immediately like it does when I refresh in the browser. The one thing I am noticing though, is it seems to cache for about an hour or so, and then update. So I'm wondering, does Apple set the cache to save and update on a time schedule, and if so can I disable that? I would prefer to just disable cache while developing. Thanks!
