How to disable Mac OS X's autocorrect but still show spelling suggestions? <body> I welcome popup spelling suggestions, but I dislike the OS replacing text as I type without any real confirmation from me.   I'm aware both behaviors can be enabled/disabled together as one option in codeSystem Prefs &gt; Keyboard &gt; Text/code, but would anyone know a way to disable the autocorrect while leaving the tooltip-style suggestions intactâ€¦perhaps via the Terminal? Thank you.   Mac OS X 9.4 (Mavericks)  <answer142176> i think you have to stop word Prediction in your iPhone, or iPad.  So, you have to go with below settings,  ol liGo to the Setting app./li liThen, Tap on general option./li liThen disable Prediction option. (turn off toggle)./li /ol  <answer161343> I havent found a solution either, but as a crude workaround you can use something like popclip, which also provides correction  <answer164303> There is another crude workaround I use - right click, Spelling and Grammar, Show Spelling And Grammar. All suggestions will be there. It is better than popups if you do not need suggestions too often.  <answer214094> When a suggestion happens and the word is underlined in blue, then right click the word and goto codeSpelling and Grammar/code and uncheck codeCorrect Spelling Automatically/code.  <answer236505> I tried going into strongSystem Preferences -- Keyboard -- Text/strong   (uncheck) "Correct Spelling Automatically"  It seems to have worked (so far) - I still get the option to correct without it automatically correcting (or autocorrecting to a word that was not a real word), at least in my emails, which was my biggest problem.  <comment167527> Sorry, I tagged this for Mac OS X. I'll edit my question to make it more clear. <comment167528> what's your OS version? from where you are facing like mail, act... <comment167529> Mavericks (I'll update question above). Autocorrect happens in all apps (it's system-wide, part of the OS). <comment258510> Close, but that only works on an app-by-app basis. I want a system-wide change. <comment289453> As said in my question, both behaviors (autocorrect and spelling suggestions) are disabled by unticking this checkbox.
