Missing toolbar for New Message window in Mail.app <body> I no longer have the toolbar at the top of New Message (The one with buttons for Send, Add Attachments..). It is only missing in New Message, if I for example reply to a message, the toolbar is correct.  img src="https://i.imgur.com/DrIRthP.png?1" alt="Missing toolbar"  I can still send the message by selecting Message - Send in the menu bar.   I have tried going to View - Customize Toolbar, but it doesn't display any options.   img src="https://i.imgur.com/JtFRJNu.png?1" alt="Toolbar customization"  I'm out of ideas. Searching the web I am only able to find the 'Customize Toolbar'-fix. I also haven't minimized the toolbar, as I've seen some solutions suggesting.  <answer230126> At top of new message page control click and uncheck "Hide Toolbar"  <comment197581> @Tetsujin Thank you. Changed it now. <comment197582> ah, there we go. Thanks. <comment281782> I also have this problem now. <comment281932> @sumelic For what it's worth, this issue solved itself for me, I have no idea what was causing it or what I did to put it right. Sorry. <comment281933> That happened for me as well, so... I guess it's just a mysterious thing that happened. Glad to hear your problem was solved!
