See Apple Music history from android on mac iTunes <body> I have installed Apple Music on my android phone. I want to know is it possible to access my recently played songs and loved songs from android app on iTunes?  For Spotify and SoundCloud all your listening history and liked songs are synced over all platforms but it seems such thing is not possible for Apple Music.
