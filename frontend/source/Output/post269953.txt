MBP 13 early 2015, but battery was manufactured at November 2016. Why? <body> Is it suspicious that my battery was manufactured November 2016? I have checked it with "Battery Health 2". The MBP 13, 2015 is from early 2015. And battery is from late 2016.   emUpdate/em  I have started with this question: Check whether a MacBook is new or not   I didn't want to ask other questions in comment, that's why I've created this one.  emUpdate 2/em  This is the information I've got with serial number:  Model:  - MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015)  Codename:   - No codename assigned.  Build Country:  - This unit was built in China.  Build Year: - We could not verify the build year of this unit.  Build Week  - Week 24 (June) or week 51 (December).  Production Nr.: - This unit was number 333 to be built that week.  <answer269959> No, I do not believe this is suspicious. The early-2015 model 13" MBP is still a current model. So, unless you actually bought the MBP strongbefore/strong November 2016, this is not at all suspicious.  To put your mind at ease you can check your MBP's serial number at a number of sites to retrieve the manufacturing date amongst other info. You can access one such site here.  [EDIT]  In response to question update.   The fact your serial number search shows it was built in either Week 24 (June) or week 51 (December) backs up my assertion. This is a new MBP built in December 2016 (strongafter/strong the manufacture of your battery and strongbefore/strong you purchased it).  strongThis confirms there is absolutely nothing suspicious about your MBP./strong   <comment339193> I have checked the serial number. See my update of the question. <comment339194> I have become it new january 2017. What is the explanation that the early 2015 one has a battery from november 2016? Or the 2015 row is still in production? <comment339201> Yes, as I said in my answer, the early-2015 model 13" MBP is still a current model. If you checked your MBP serial number I'm guessing the manufacture date was probably November or December 2016? <comment339205> I have updated my question with the information I have got via your link with my serial number. <comment339231> 2015 is the model design year, not the manufacture year. It is possible for a 2015 model type to be built a long time after it was initially designed. <comment339241> @JohnKeates I thought that at the moment (Jan 2017) apple produce in MBP row only 2016 and late 2015
