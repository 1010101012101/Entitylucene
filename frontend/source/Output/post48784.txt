How can I get a screenshot of what's on my AppleTV? <body> Preferably Wirelessly. Any apps for that?  Obviously I'm talking about the more recent iOS powered little black box AppleTV, not the original model.  <answer48793> As far as I know AppleTV has no capabilities for this. What I've done is simply to take a photo of the TV screen.   <answer48813> After some quick Googling I found these steps:  ul liJailbreak/li liInstall aTV Flash (black)/li liInstall nitoTV/li liInstall 'screencapture' (through nitoTV)/li liSSH in: codessh root@Apple-TV.local/code (or codessh root@ipaddress/code, e.g. codessh root@192.168.3.61/code)/li liAt this point typing in codescreencapture/code SHOULD save Screenshot.png to root. If it does not you may need to change ownership on root via: chown mobile:staff .//li /ul  Obviously less than ideal, but possible.  <comment56092> I'll up vote this, but I'm looking for a non-jailbreak answer, so not going to mark as accepted...
