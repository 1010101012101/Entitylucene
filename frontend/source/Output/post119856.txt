Syncing iCloud/iTunes <body> If I use my google email for my itunes account on  my ipad, but then use my yahoo email as my apple ID for my iphone and my icloud is my yahoo account, when i log into my itunes on my iphone and use the google email (ipad ID) to sync my downloaded music, does that make the rest of my phone sync with my ipad? I'm not wanting it to, and I just want to make sure it doesn't.
