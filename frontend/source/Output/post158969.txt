How can I add ".mp4" to the end of multiple files in a folder? <body> I just received a bunch of videos (for editing) and something weird happened. I was told the files are .mp4, but when I received them they did not have a filetype assigned to them.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ek4GR.png" alt="Example"  I can add ".mp4" to the file name, which fixes the issue and allows my applications to recognize the files. Problem is, there are ema lot/em of files.   Is there any way to easily add a ".mp4" to the end of all of the files at once? I'm willing to download an app for this if needed (Mac OS X 10.8.5)  Thank you!  <answer158974> If you're comfortable with the command line you can try this in the terminal.app:  precodefor i in *; do mv "$i" "$i.mp4"; done; /code/pre  Navigate to the directory with all of your files and run the above command.  <answer163202> Sometimes the file extension is hidden, but it actually exists.  To show file extensions:  ol liChoose Finder  Preferences, then click Advanced./li liSelect or deselect “Show all filename extensions.”/li /ol  Info  <comment186869> Is there a reason why you're still on 10.8.5? Yosemite adds, among other things, a batch renaming ability. <comment186871> Uhh… why are you piping text into `sh`? A simple command would really be sufficient. <comment186872> This seems to meet the OPs needs. Feel free to post a better solution to help the OP. <comment186890> If they are not comfortable with the terminal, they can navigate by opening the terminal, typing `cd ` (with a space) and then dragging the folder that contains the files into the terminal window and hitting return. Then run the `for` command... <comment186895> Worked great! Also, thank you @beroe, I always have to look up the commands for navigating since I rarely use Terminal
