How do the cellular capabilities differ between the different iPhone 6s/6s Plus models? <body> h1Info/h1  Apple lists the LTE band support of its iPhone models on this page: iPhone LTE Support. It lists more information about the iPhone 6s models on this page, specifically in the Cellular and Wireless section: iPhone 6s - Tech Specs  Here is a comparison of the iPhone 6s/6s Plus models' cellular specs as of the time of writing this question, noting certification differences in the four major US carriers:  h2A1633/34 (Certified US support: AT&amp;T)/h2  ul liLTE (Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30)/li liTD-LTE (Bands 38, 39, 40, 41)/li liTD-SCDMA 1900 (F), 2000 (A)/li liCDMA EV-DO Rev.

Am I missing something? Why wouldn't they just make one model pair for US customers (A1633/34)?  <comment250033> I just spoke (on the phone) to a "technical engineer" at Apple who told me that the difference between models is indeed **only** support for LTE band 30.
