Get disk temperature in terminal <body> Is there a command I can use just to get the hard disk temperature in the terminal?  Is this possible without a third party app?  <answer59598> Unfortunately you won't be able to do this without a third party app. However, if you're happy to use a third party software it is possible to get the temperature in terminal.  You need to use temperature monitor, which is a free application and provides a command line option. The ins and outs of using the software may be a bit much to go into here, but you can find all the instructions here.  <answer59610> You could try Smartmontools (S.M.A.R.T. Monitoring Tools) which has a command-line app. Most (if not all?) hard drives will report their temperature in the S.M.A.R.T. report.  There's also a native GUI SMARTReporter app which lets you perform certain actions based on temperature, if that's what you're after (and also happens to include the codesmartctl/code command-line binary — though if you're just after the binary you should, as a rule, get it from the "original" developers, just to be safe!).  <answer95766> iStat Menus shows a lot of detailed information about the running state of the system, including all temperature sensors.  <answer190371> You will only be able to get a temperature reading if there is a sensor. This article explains how you can get this information via the codeioreg/code command.  This one-liner worked for me to get the GPU temperature (unfortunately I was not able to see any other IOHWSensors on my machine):  precodeecho $((`ioreg -c IOHWSensor | grep "current-value" | grep -oE [0-9]+` / 65536)) /code/pre  <answer262150> Without add on software there is no command to get the disk temperature, after:  precode$ brew install smartmontools /code/pre  One can run the command:  precode$ smartctl -a disk0 | grep Temperature /code/pre  To retrieve de disk temperature, like:  precode194 Temperature_Celsius     0x0022   044   044   000    Old_age   Always       -       56 (Min/Max 17/70) /code/pre  <comment112389> He wants something without third party app. <comment332017> On a MacBookAir6,1 there is no `temperature` sensor neither `fanspeed` match to find using `ioreg -c IOHWSensor -w 0`.
