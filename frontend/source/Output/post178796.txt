Making Favorites in Finder collapse according to number of items in it <body> I know favorites can collapse completely but how possible is it to make a dropdown collapse inside the Favorites itself so that when the items reach about 5, it automatically hides all others with a dropdown arrow for seeing the others?  <answer178797> This is currently not possible.
