How do I force Safari to ask me to save all passwords? <body> I'm using 10.10.3. iCloud keychain is enabled.   Anyway, I find that Safari will ask to save passwords for some sites but not for others.  examples of sites where I get prompted: eBay, amazon, some local discussion forum, stackexchange  examples of sites where I strongdon't/strong get prompted: macrumors, xdc-developers and many others  I've checked the settings and "Auto-fill username and passwords" is enabled i the password tab. I've removed all passwords but it's still happening.  Any ideas on how to fix it?  <answer184736> This is, technically, not an answer but might be a emreason/em why some sites do not save passwords.  They (those web sites/pages) have code in them to tell the browser to not save the password.   I used to have a JavaScript bookmarklet that would (with varying levels of success) remove the code that said "don't save the passwords" but when I moved over to 1Password I stopped needing that.  Possibly a password manager might do that for you (there are free ones, I believe) or a bit of google-fu might find you that bit of JavaScript that worked some of the time in telling sites to stop telling your browser to not save the password.  <comment218946> For clarification: do you want safari to prompt to you save  autofill **all passwords?** Or do you want to prevent safari from autofilling passwords (albeit, **while saving them all**)? Additionally, what, if any browser extensions are enabled? <comment218948> I want safari to prompt me to save passwords all websites. I can then click yes/no. no browser extension is installed.
