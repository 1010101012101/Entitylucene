Delete Key Repeat on macOS Sierra 10.12.0 Broken <body> Holding down a key on the keyboard does not cause it to repeat correctly.  The key will repeat, but only after 2 seconds or so.  In some cases it doesn't repeat at all.  There are a few suggestions floating around in forums but none seem to correct the problem.    Settings in preferences are ignored: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gM5NO.png" alt="enter image description here"  Interestingly, key repeat does seem to work in Terminal, but that's the exception.  It's broken in Notes, Mail, TextEdit, etc.  Any ideas?  <answer258547> This bug was fixed by Apple in macOS 10.12.1, released a few hours after I wrote the above ...  <answer269389> This worked for me on macOS 10.12.2:  http://www.howtogeek.com/267463/how-to-enable-key-repeating-in-macos/  In a nutshell, it says to:  ol liOpen Terminal/li liEnter the command: codedefaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false/code/li liRestart/li /ol  You need to restart after toggling this setting on OR off.  <comment323258> We like answers to be more than just a single line.

My question is very detailed and specific and includes a screenshot.  The answer does not need the same level of detail because the 10.12.1 macOS update demonstrated that my question was caused by a bug in 10.12.0.  Apple, as you know, doesn't provide exhaustive lists of every bug they fix in point releases or any releases so what is there to link to? <comment333073> I'm still having the issue on 10.12.2. Was the bug reintroudced? <comment333088> It's true that characters repeat with a maintained keypress *only* in Terminal, I also don't get repetition in Notes, Mail and TextEdit.  However the "bug" was particularly bad in 10.12.0 where you could not hold down the delete/backspace key to delete a line of text, this now works fine.  I believe key repeat was removed about a year ago in favour of a popup menu which gives you accented characters in different languages (on some characters).  But repeat on the delete key should always work, which is does for me in 10.12.2. <comment338415> That's good to know, thanks.  I actually prefer the default behaviour and use the popup with accented characters.  I updated the title post to better reflect the problem, which was fixed in macOS 10.12.1 <comment354757> As an additional comment - this will change the behavior of "press-and-hold to get diacritic keys" - like the "en-yay" n key (Ã±) will no longer be available by holding "n" and then pressing "1" (on my US keyboard).  I spent a long time remembering the diacritics codes for some keys, so it doesn't help me.
