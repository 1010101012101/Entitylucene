Diary App which supports Tags with values <body> I am looking for a diary app, which supports strongtags with values/strong. Which means I can define custom tags, and with each entry I can add tags and define values for it.  Example:  ul li01/01/2013 had a great party today, mood:5, health:7, moneySpent:152/li li02/01/2013 met Tina today, went to the pool, mood:7, success:3/li /ul  It should provide some line charts to see how the values go up and down.   I couldn't find it using my search terms, maybe you know how to call this feature, or know an app implementing this?  <answer86561> A great diary app is Momento. Supports tags and has a great interface: http://www.momentoapp.com/
