How can I delete my Mail App and re-install it? <body> My mail app does not give me a viewer window and all File options are greyed out &amp; not available.  iMac 3.06 intel core 2 Duo OS X 10.9.4  Mail opens in this state. I have created new user accounts and same problem exists. I have tried all suggestions, thanks, but still no joy.  When I re-installed OSX all data remained.  It worked normally in Safe mode.   <answer138551> Before you delete it, see if you can repair Mail.  ol liIn Mail, go to Window → Connection Doctor and let it verify your connections to see if all works there./li liNext step is to rebuild your Mail database. Go to the Mailbox tab and at the bottom click on Rebuild.  emIf 1 and 2 are not accessible (grayed out)/em/li liTry to reset Mail settings. - which you will need to set up after following:  Quit Mail, then go to Finder and press ⇧⌘G and enter (or copy) the following:  precode~/Library/Containers/com.apple.mail/Data/Library/Preferences /code/pre  Look for "com.apple.mail.plist" and drag it the Desktop, then restart Mail.  ul liAlternatively, you can use this one-liner in your Terminal app (located in the Utility folder):  precodekillall Mail &amp;&gt; /dev/null; mv ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.mail/Data/Library/Preferences/com.apple.mail.plist ~/Desktop &amp;&amp; open -a Mail /code/pre  supSource: http://georgegarside.com/o/se/resetMail.html/sup/li /ul/li /ol  If all else fails you can reinstall the operating system (Mavericks) that includes the Mail.app. Boot into the Recovery HD with ⌘R, then follow the instructions.

In rare occasions your user permissions or ACLs might need some repair. This answer describes the process.  <comment163469> Be aware, deleting an app does not change any settings back to defaults.  Settings are stored in the user library.  A good tip for troubleshooting any software issue is to always test in a completely new user account.  If the same problem exists, its a system wide problem, if not, its a user account problem. <comment163535> Thanks for your suggestions. I have now tried all the suggestions above including re-installing the OSX to no avail. Still the same problem. I have all the same data on my Macbook, could I migrate that to the iMac? <comment163536> CAn you please add some details about the problem. Do you start Mail and immediately get the problem described? What happens if you create a new user account on your Mac and run Mail there? If this works, add your email account and try again. <comment163542> When you reinstalled OS X, did you keep all your documents and data intact? (i.e.: all your stuff was still on there?)  Like I stated above, reinstalling the app or the entire OS for that matter won't help you solve a problem that is a user account issue. <comment163655> @GeorgeGarside - thank you for the ☮ offer - accepted, let it be ☮
