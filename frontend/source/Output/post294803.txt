How to add series metadata to epub files in iBooks <body> First I tried using Calibre but it had no effect. Then, this was the solution (iBooks series metadata) I found.  Thus, I went and tried to edit the SQLite files. Found Books.plist easily enough, tried to edit using DB Browser for SQLite, but it asks for an encryption key that isn’t my Apple ID password nor my User password. I also tried to open it using Xcode, and while it did allow me to read the file, it didn’t open in tabular form, just in a weird file path way.  SO, I tried another solution in the post, to download the samples and copy the OPS information from the preexisting book into the sample. Found where my book files are stored in the cloud (Where are my iBooks stored in macOS Sierra?), but no samples seem to be stored there. Checked Where are the sample books stored in the iBooks for Mac OS X? , but the solution doesn't make sense (the answer is in the question?).  Therefore,  ol liHow do I view Books.plist in a tabular form that allows me to edit as foliva did in the thread.  or/li liWhere are the sample files stored if not in iCloud Drive (~/Library/Mobile\ Documents/iCloud\~com\~apple\~iBooks/Documents)?/li /ol  Thanks
