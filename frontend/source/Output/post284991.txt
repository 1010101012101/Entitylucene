How to get hyperlinks working in Mail for iOS 10 on iPhone 7 <body> Attached is a screenshot of an email. The blue highlighted text are hyperlinks that, when I click on them, should jump to a specific place further down the email. However, if I press on these links, nothing happens. How can I get these hyperlinks working?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eKrfD.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment359373> Are you the recipient of the email, or the author of it? If you're the recipient, does the email include a link (usually at the bottom) for you to view the email in your browser? If you're the author, in what software are you writing the email script? <comment359409> I'm the recipient. There's no link to view email in browser.
