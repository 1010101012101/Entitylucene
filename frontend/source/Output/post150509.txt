Someone made a FaceTime call with my number <body> My husband told me that he received a FaceTime call from my number but he missed the call. I never called him and I don't have any outgoing calls in my phone or anything. Is my Apple ID compromised?   <answer150523> First double check with your hubby if the call came from your FaceTime.  If it was, and you have no records, then do reset your account (new strong password would be good).  <comment177124> Possibly? Check other devices you have associated with that Apple ID - iPads and Macs - which could also make FaceTime calls. If you're worried, [change your Apple ID password](http://support.apple.com/kb/ht5624), and check the list of email addresses associated with your Apple ID.
