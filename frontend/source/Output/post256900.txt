No ringtone for Face Time <body> I don't get a ring tone when I get a face time call. In addition when i charge the iPad I used to get a ting sound. Now I don't get that either. Are both the problems connected?  <answer257183> You're probably in the Silent mode. Try to put side switch in the initial state. Here is the picture of the side switch location:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ruh8G.jpg" alt="iPad side switch"  <comment321286> Thank you "alljamin"! That did the trick.
