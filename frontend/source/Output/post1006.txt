How to skip system hotkeys when using terminal emacs? <body> I like to run GNU emacs in a Terminal window under Mac OS X 10.6.4.  Unfortunately, whenever I hit a hot key for emacs I often "trip" on an OS X system hot key.  For instance, when I hit kbd⌃/kbd + kbdspace/kbd in emacs, I end up opening Spotlight.  Is there a way to "skip" system level hot keys when I use emacs under Terminal.app?  I hate to have to manually deactivate all system hot keys and re-enable them whenever I use emacs.  <answer1007> Found a way here that solved most of my own problem:  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/604808/option-or-command-key-as-meta-key-for-lispbox-on-macintosh  <answer21798> On my machine, I replaced the Control modifier key for the Spotlight commands with Command. This is simple, since it changes it for all applications, and doesn't usually conflict with anything else.     System Preferences  Keyboard  Keyboard Shortcuts  Spotlight   Alternatively, you could add an additional modifier, e.g., kbd⌃/kbd-kbd⌥/kbd-kbdspace/kbd. Or even change it altogether. I've used kbd⌃/kbd-kbd⌘/kbd-kbdF/kbd in the past, for example; though that's now the default key for Full Screen on Lion.  The default Spotlight keys are the main conflict with Terminal. I don't think there are other default shortcut keys that are a problem (because they either don't use Control, or if they do they usually use other modifiers or keys that don't conflict with how Terminal handles keyboard input).  <comment23990> Can you elaborate? Do you mean you switched from using Emacs in a terminal to using Aquamacs or some other "GUI" Emacs?
