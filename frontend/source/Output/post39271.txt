Sending an email to senders of selected emails in Mail.app <body> I want to select multiple messages in a Mail.app folder by hand, do emX/em, and then have a new mail message window appear with all those senders in the "To:" or "Bcc:" field. What is that magical emX/em option?  Is it even built in, or do I need to find\write some Applescript? It looks like Automator doesn't have actions to grab senders from mail messages, so that's no way forward.  I am blown away that this is not as simple as selecting the messages and hitting reply. (It's greyed out, if you try.) I found this discussion about the same problem, but there was no real answer offered besides "try another email client" and "create rules for incoming mail that auto-replies". Terrible!  <answer39517> Try this AppleScript (using 10.7.3).  Select the messages you want to reply to before executing the script.  precodetell Application "Mail" activate set selectedMessages to selection set countMessages to (count of selectedMessages) if countMessages is equal to 0 then     display alert "No Messages Selected" message "You must select a message first." else set theMessage to make new outgoing message with properties {visible:true, subject:"My Subject", content:"My Body"} repeat with i from 1 to countMessages     set theInput to item i of selectedMessages set theName to sender of theInput tell theMessage     make new to recipient at end of to recipients with properties {name:theName} end tell end repeat end if end tell /code/pre  <comment45133> Aren't you amazing? This really did the trick. It's crazy that this isn't built in, but your script has certainly helped me in the mean-time. I appreciate it.
