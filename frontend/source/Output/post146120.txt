Switching between proxy and no-proxy config in .bash_profile <body> I have configured proxy settings (on mavericks) within $HOME/.bash_profile (purpose: to make npm, rvm, git use the corporate proxy) and the configs are as follows:  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codegit config --global http.proxy http://proxy_usr:proxy_pwd@proxy_ipaddress:proxy_port git config --global http.proxy https://proxy_usr:proxy_pwd@proxy_ipaddress:proxy_port export http_proxy=http://proxy_usr:proxy_pwd@proxy_ipaddress:proxy_port export ALL_PROXY=$http_proxy npm config set proxy http://proxy_usr:proxy_pwd@proxy_ipaddress:proxy_port npm config set https-proxy http://proxy_usr:proxy_pwd@proxy_ipaddress:proxy_port /code/pre  However, I don't need these configurations at home.  What is the best way to manage the .bash_profile so that my mac should pick the settings based on the proxy? Can we write a shell script to set my .bash_profile based on network I use (home/ work - no-proxy/proxy)?  <answer147467> You may create a separate shell script and source it whenever you are at a "non-proxified" location. For example, I have a .unset_proxy.sh under my user directory that I source whenever I need to get work done at home or starbucks. This is what it looks like:  precodeunset HTTP_PROXY unset HTTPS_PROXY unset http_proxy unset https_proxy npm config delete https-proxy npm config delete http-proxy npm config delete proxy /code/pre  This is the command I run:     . ~/.unset_proxy  When I'm back at the office building I simply source my bash profile to reset the proxy:      . ~/.bash_profile
