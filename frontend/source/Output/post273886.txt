Tired of the Apple Mail Client Woosh sound on mail send <body> I am using Macbook pro 13inch 2015 model. Using OSX Sierra.  Every time I send a mail with the apple mail client is makes a woosh sound. In order to suppress this sound I have done the following things  ol liGo into settings - notifications and switch off the notification sounds for mail client./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/teQPs.png" alt="enter image description here"  ol start="2" liDisable User Interface sound effects in settings - sound./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/q4EFw.png" alt="enter image description here"  However still when I send a mail it makes a stupid woooosh sound.  <answer273887> Go to Mail's Preferences.  Mail  Preferences  General tab  Deselect the      Play sounds for other mail actions   checkbox.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YnESf.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment344303> Pro Tip: If you hit cmd/shift/4 for a screen shot, **then** tap the space bar, you can click in the window you want to screenshot & it will save with a nice little drop shadow too. Lovely for SE illustrations etc :)
