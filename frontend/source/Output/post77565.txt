Applescript creating Sym link with spaces in the path <body> I'm trying to create a sym link to a network directory when i log in. This is working for a couple of other directories without spaces in the name, but for the life of me I cannot get this one director to work and I'm assuming it has to do with the space characters.  in a terminal window I can successfully create the link manually with  precodeln -s "/Volumes/D/Contracts and Price Sheets"/ ~/Desktop/Contracts /code/pre  my current applescript looks like this  precodetell application "Finder"   mount volume "smb://user:password@192.168.0.0/D"   set contractsPath to "/Volumes/D/Contracts and Price Sheets/"   if not (exists ((path to desktop as text) &amp; "hDrive")) then     do shell script "ln -s /Volumes/D/Home/user/ ~/Desktop/hDrive"   end if   if not (exists ((path to desktop as text) &amp; "sDrive")) then     do shell script "ln -s /Volumes/D/Data/ ~/Desktop/sDrive"   end if   if not (exists ((path to desktop as text) &amp; "Inventory")) then     do shell script "ln -s /Volumes/D/Inventory/ ~/Desktop/Inventory"   end if   if not (exists ((path to desktop as text) &amp; "Contracts")) then     do shell script "ln -s " &amp; quoted form of the POSIX path of contractsPath &amp; " ~/Desktop/Contracts"   end if end tell /code/pre  I'm sure all these conditionals are bad habit, but I'm not an experienced programmer. Anyway, the first three drives mount successfully, however the final directory (with spaces in the title) just will not work. I've combed the web for answers, but keep getting no results.  Any and all input is greatly appreciated. Thanks!  <answer77593> contractsPath is already a posix path. Try:   codedo shell script "ln -s " &amp; quoted form of contractsPath &amp; " ~/Desktop/Contracts"/code  <answer79436> Hm, I've run a similar script in AppleScript Editor but it works ok for me:  precodeset contractsPath to "/Users/subhu/Test test test/" do shell script "ln -s " &amp; quoted form of the POSIX path of contractsPath &amp; " ~/Desktop/test" /code/pre  Note that, if you escaping a backslash with another backslash you have to use just codecontractsPath/code, not codequoted form of the POSIX path of contractsPath/code, e.g.:  precodeset contractsPath to "/Users/subhu/Test\\ test\\ test" do shell script "ln -s " &amp; contractsPath &amp; " ~/Desktop/test" /code/pre  Try it.  <comment89886> Have you tried adding escaped quotation marks to the contractsPath string, i.e. `"\"/Volumes/D/Contracts and Price Sheets/\""`? <comment89890> yes, I've also tried escaping the backslash with another backslash.. so `/Volumes/D/Contracts\\ and\\ Price\\ Sheets/`
