7th gen iPod radio with a bluetooth headset in motorcycle helmet <body> I have just bought a 7th generation iPod and I have a bluetooth headset in a motorcycle helmet. Is there any way to listen to the radio through bluetooth given that the headphones are the antenna?  <answer194343> Assuming you are talking about an iPod nano.     iPod nano uses the headphone cord as an antenna, so you must connect headphones to iPod nano to receive a radio signal. For better reception, make sure the cord isnâ€™t tangled or coiled.   strongFM radio will not play through a Bluetooth accessory./strong   Source: Apple support document  <comment231752> If you can link to the Apple definition of 7th gen or provide a specific detail someone might have a better answer than "no". Although, no might be the correct answer even with more detail.
