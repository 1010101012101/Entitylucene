Cannot Upgrade jailbroken iPod touch 4.3.3 to iOS 6.1.2 <body> I got a jailbroken iPod from a friend and I want to update to iOS 6 so I can restore my backed up data on it.  I tried SHIFT + Restore / Upgrade to iOS 6 but the first error I got was this  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6lSXk.png" alt="Before using TinyUmbrella" strongFigure 1/strong   Then I did some research and ended up getting strongTinyUmbrella/strong and doing the hosts redirection and strongSHSH/strong trick. After that I repeated the restore process now I'm getting this error (strongFigure 2/strong) in the second phase of strongemVerifying Update iPod update with Apple/em/strong (strongFigure 3/strong)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/a3ZWz.png" alt="After using TinyUmbrella"strongFigure 2/strong   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CJkRI.png" alt="enter image description here"strongFigure 3/strong  PS: I also tried DFU mode but I got error strong1600/strong.  Can you please help me restore or update my iPod to strongany/strong OFW. My goal is to strongremove/strong the CFW.  <answer83865> I finally resolved this. It turns out I had 6.0 (I didn't know because my friend was the one who got it and Apple isn't signing it anymore). I downloaded 6.1.2 and then my IP got blocked for too many requests. So I used a VPN for verification and then it worked.  So, like @Chris A said; You don't need to do all that TinyUmbrella crap (unless you're downgrading). If you have the current iOS offline (like in my case) or updating to the recent firmware, it'll work just fine.  Thanks to all that strongstared/strong at my question.   <comment96512> You shouldn't have to use tinyUmbrella to restore to the official, current firmware version. What happens when you click restore in iTunes without holding shift? <comment96520> @ChrisA I was getting error 1394 like I said in the post. I think it had to do with the fact that it was 6.0 not 6.1.2.
