How could I streamline this script to find Finder items faster? <body> I have an Applescript script which checks if my playlist has less than 25 songs in it shorter than 11 minutes and then moves some random files from another folder to my Temp folder to make up the number.   Is there any reason the "Finder" bit of the script is so slow (it takes nearly 15 seconds to execute)? Any code workaround I could use here?  precode--this adds some songs if the playlist has less than 25 songs in it shorter than 11 mins tell application "iTunes"     set thePlaylist to playlist "Temp on iPod"     --counts tracks less than 11 mins long     count ((tracks of thePlaylist) whose duration is less than 665)     set currentCount1 to result     if currentCount1 is less than 25 then         tell application "Finder"             set theDestination to folder "Macintosh HD:Temp to be Listened to:temp on iPod:"             get every file of folder "Macintosh HD:Temp to be Listened to:Temp:Short Temp (Small Files, &lt;20mb):" whose kind is "MP3 audio"             --this only gets the top level files             set theMusic to result             set myList to {}             set theReplaceNo to (25 - currentCount1)             repeat theReplaceNo times                 set currentFile to some item of theMusic                 copy currentFile to the end of myList             end repeat             --reveal every item of myList             reveal myList             delay 1.5             move myList to theDestination         end tell     end if end tell /code/pre  Can anyone help?  <answer258890> I tested your code on my OSX 10.9.5 and saw strongno issue/strong. It took 2 seconds (delay included). So, for me, the code is correct.  What is your version of OSX ? (Maybe a bug ...)  You probably already know that but to investigate more on the part that slow the script down, you can use the following 2 statements :  precode-- Put this before the code you want to test : set t to (time of (current date)) --Start timing operations  ... your slow code here ...  -- Put this at the end of the code you want to test set total to (time of (current date)) - t --End timing /code/pre  Sorry, I can't help more.
