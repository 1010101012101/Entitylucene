Accept Self Signed Certificate - Trust Settings <body> I have implemented the following Bash function on OSX 15.6.0 to download the certificate and to trust it locally.  precodesave_cert(){       CERT=/tmp/tmpcert   openssl s_client -showcerts -connect $1:${2:-443} &lt;/dev/null 2&gt;/dev/null|openssl x509 -outform PEM &gt; $CERT   security add-trusted-cert -r trustRoot -k $HOME/Library/Keychains/dev.keychain $CERT   rm $CERT } /code/pre  How can I bypass this settings dialog for a particular keychain? Is there a permission I can apply to a particular user or a particular keychain that allows passwordless Certificate Trust Settings modification? This message still occurs if I run with sudo.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qPhvh.png" alt="Message Prompt"  If I cancel the Dialog I get the following message:   precodeSecTrustSettingsSetTrustSettings: The authorization was canceled by the user. /code/pre  I couldn't find any further documentation on this particular setting.
