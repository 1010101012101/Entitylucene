Can my iBook use any PC2700 DDR-SDRAM RAM? <body> My iBook currently has a stick of 256MB DDR PC2700 RAM installed.  I want to bump this up to a gigabyte (because programs these days take a lot of RAM to link). I was wondering if an iBook G4 can use any brand of PC2700 or only RAM made specifically for iBooks.   For example, there was a time when graphics card needed to be specially flashed to work for Apple computers.  <answer91488> It does not need a specific ram (like any other computers).   But be sure to buy SO-DIMM ram and not DIMM.
