"Developer" option is not available under Settings menu. Why? <body> I am missing a Developer option under Settings menu. What do I need to do to make it appear?  <answer135385> In versions of Xcode prior to Xcode 6, you can connect the device to your computer over USB, open Xcode → Organizer and select Use for Development.  Use for Development was removed from Xcode in Xcode 6 and later. It is no longer possible to do this for devices using Xcode 6 or later, even with the Devices page (⇧⌘2).  <answer178250> Apple removed the device list from Organizer in Xcode 6. Try going to Window-Devices. You should see your attached device in the list and from there you can enable development.  <answer180216> I found that by powering off the device, and turning it back on while connected to the machine running Xcode 6.3, the Developer settings menu returned for my iOS 8.3 devices.  <comment210545> I see no option "Use for Development" on that screen <comment210648> Sure. This is what I see after navigating in XCode 6.2 to Window - Organizer: http://i.imgur.com/Mw61lob.png <comment211109> How does this improve or differ from other answers? <comment211111> The OP said he was opening Organizer. Devices are no longer displayed there in xcode. You can find your devices in the devices window. That's the difference. <comment211112> Well explain that and give some idea of versions of Xcode <comment211115> I made the edit based on your recommendation. <comment214002> @Jonah Use for Development appears to have been removed alongside the introduction of the new Devices page (accessible through ⇧⌘2). (Sorry for the delay, missed the ping—feel free to ping me in [chat] as I do miss the occasional comment) <comment220734> This is the solution as of May 2015. Tested with iOS 8.3 and XCode 6.3.1 on iPhone 6. <comment220736> TotalForge's answer worked for me. <comment221083> How do you enable development from the Devices window?
