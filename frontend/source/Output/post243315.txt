Alarm application using the maximum possible volume level <body> The iPhone's alarm shares its volume with the ringer, and I don't want the ringer volume to be too loud. I am looking for an alarm application for iPhone using the maximum possible volume level.  Ideally, it would gradually increase the volume till the maximum possible volume level. If it needs the iOS to be jailbroken, that's fine.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SU0fl.png" width="280"   <answer243338> The Wake Alarm Clock app does exactly what you want. No jailbreak required, progressive increase of volume up to the maximum. But, I'm using it because there is a setting that forces you to shake your phone to stop the alarm, and you are awaken almost instantly.  <answer244989> You can use the Safe Alarm 2 application. It works on all iPhones and iPads with iOS 7, 8 and 9.
