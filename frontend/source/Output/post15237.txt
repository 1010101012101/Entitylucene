Change Account Password to Blank <body> I recently changed an account password by accident, and was wondering how to set it back to a blank password via the shell. I have root privileges. Please help :)  codepasswd USER/code doesn't accept blank passwords  <answer15238> You can set the account password to no password using the Users and Groups Pane in System Preferences.  <answer15248> The codepasswd/code command rejects the idea that you can have a 0 length password.   Instead use codedscl/code which is more accepting of the notion that the password is nothing.  precodedscl . -passwd /Users/foo /code/pre  You can press enter to make the new password blank and then may get an error and have to enter the old password if you are not root but once you authenticate (or are root already) the blank password will be written.  <comment16514> I'd wager the preference pane is calling dscl and not passwd :-) <comment16605> You really want a blank password? From a security perspective, that's not at all a good idea. <comment16833> The password prompt used by (the default bash) sudo doesn't accept an empty password either â€” even if you changed to one you couldn't really use it without some workaround.
