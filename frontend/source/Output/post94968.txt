Antivirus in Mac <body> How can i know if an antivirus is installed on the system?   I can get all apps that are installed in the system, but i dont know get their categories.  Thanks for all.  Best regards!  <answer94978> If the Apps are installed from the Mac App Store, you can use a Finder Spotlight search and the 'Category' attribute.  Select strongOtherâ€¦/strong under the attribute dropdown menu and search for &amp; check the attribute 'Category'.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/50Wd2.png" alt="Search Attribute: Category"  Then do a search using that attribute.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wnjte.png" alt="Searching Applications for Category: Utilities"  Antivirus apps from the Mac App Store are classed as 'Utilities'  <comment111362> Don't use Mac Anti Virus. Just. Don't. (unless you frequently share files with other PCs you might contaminate)
