Looking for a mac app to design beautiful illustrations automatically and easily <body> Check out for example:   Illustration sample 1 http://cosi235a.courses.salas.com.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/graphics/term_structure.png   Illustration sample 2 http://cosi235a.courses.salas.com.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/graphics/build_measure_learn.png  I created these using Powerpoint on Mac, and then copying and pasting the image alone into a png and using that on a web page. What a pain and also the images look like Powerpoint images.  I bet there's a nice Mac app (or web site) that lets me create a wide variety of interesting illustrations that help me make a point. I have OmniGraffle which does some of this but I still have to be 'the illustrator'. Is there an app that works at a somewhat higher 'semantic' level?  <answer101344> Apples Pages.  I have used this only a little bit. But in most case it suits my basic needs. I have not tried to do anything really fancy. So cannot tell you if it is too limited for you  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7FPzB.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment119357> If you know LaTeX maybe TikZ... But it's definitely not easy to use. <comment119372> Are you familiar with PowerPoint capabilities ? You are using simple (as is) shapes without applying 3D rendering ect.... If you are an Artist there is unlimited possibilities to change your basic shapes in to art.
