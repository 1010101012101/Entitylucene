Where iTunes stores my playlists and ratings <body> I am wondering where iTunes keeps all my playlists? Locally on my computer or in the iCloud? I have created the new playlist on my Mac and I can see it on iPhone (without connecting it to MAC), so it looks like it is stored in iCloud. Is it right? Do I need to do something to backup them?  And the similar question about ratings. Where they are stored and how can I keep them between iTunes and Mac OS reinstallation?  <answer194235> Actually it stores the original on your computer.  The iCloud just gets a copy of it if you have set it up that way.  You can find the file in the code~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Library.itl/code  and in the codeiTunes Music Library.xml/code (located in same place)  https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201610  <comment231602> Thanks. How can I set up iTunes to store the playlists in the iCloud? <comment231603> Read this https://support.apple.com/kb/PH19610?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US
