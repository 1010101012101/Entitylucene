Icon problem on iPad Air <body> A friend has the iPad Air with iOS 8.1.  She has used Safari to add a bunch of Youtube videos to her home screen.  That way she can touch an icon on her home screen and it will immediate load the video in Safari.  But a few times now she has seen all of those Youtube icons on her home screen change, as can be seen in this screenshot (the "Coffee Hous", "2 Butterflies" and "Homeward" icons are supposed to be Youtube icons):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9xqC4.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  If she touches one of those icons to load the video, and then goes back to the home screen, the icon changes back to the Youtube icon.  But then maybe a few days or a week later, all of those Youtube icons change back to how it looks in the screenshot.  Why is this happening, and how can she prevent it from happening again?
