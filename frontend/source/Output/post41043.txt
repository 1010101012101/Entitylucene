How do I search all hidden files that are in hidden folders using Terminal? <body> I need to find some configs buried in some hidden folders and can't recall where they are to navigate to them directly kbdCmd/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbdG/kbd.  I did a codesudo find -name Foo*/code (slow), but none of the returned files were in hidden folders.  What is the easiest way to search all hidden files?  <answer41044> Try the codelocate/code command. You will have to codesudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.locate.plist/code first and wait for the locate DB to be generated.  <answer41103> Assuming that by “hidden file” you mean files whose name begins with a dot or that are located somewhere under a directory whose name begins with a dot, and not other forms of invisible files, the following command prints the names of all hidden files. It's slow as it goes over all the file names everywhere on your system.  precodesudo find / -name '.*' \( -type d -exec find {} \; -prune -o -print \) /code/pre  Explanation:  ul licode-type d -exec find {} \; -prune/code executes codefind/code on every directory (whose name matched code.*/code), and skips descending into that directory because of the code-prune/code./li licode-type d … -o -print/code causes all non-directories that match code.*/code to be printed./li /ul  If you're looking for a file with a specific name or pattern:  precodesudo find / -name 'Foo*' -path '*/.*' /code/pre  The code*/.*/code pattern on the whole path forces matches to be under a hidden directory.  You may want to add code-xdev/code after the code//code to avoid traversing special filesystems and removable disks.  <answer55497> codemdfind/code seems to ignore a lot of hidden files. codemdfind 'kMDItemFSInvisible==1&amp;&amp;kMDItemFSName==filename'/code does list code.DS_Store/code files, but not for example code.bash_history/code. I haven't found any way to search for files in some hidden directories like code/private/etc//code.  Anyway, Find Any File is a lot faster than codefind/code.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nwXlY.png" alt=""     Find Any File is a program for Mac OS X that lets you search for files on your disks.      ul   liContrary to Spotlight, it does not use a database but instead uses the file system driver's fast search operations, where available. This lets you search for file properties such as name, dates, size, etc., but not for file content (use Spotlight or EasyFind for that)./li   liFind Any File can find files that Spotlight doesn't, e.g. those inside bundles and packages and in inside folders that are usually excluded from Spotlight search./li   liFinally, it is quite fast. A search only takes a few seconds on an internal hard disk or SSD. Try for yourself!/li   /ul   <answer139250> strongEasyFind/strong is an excellent alternative app to get the job done. It's free and easy. You can search for text in files (even invisible ones). &lt;= This may be an easier way to find your config files.  You can get it from the App Store https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/easyfind/id411673888?mt=12  Disclaimer: emI am not affiliated with the developer./em  <comment46489> It's such a nuisance that Spotlight doesn't pick up hidden / (dot-)files, because mdfind is vastly superior to slocate. <comment46634> Ah, thanks. And it looks like -x is preferred now, as -xdev is deprecated. <comment63745> Note: Using `sudo` is unnecessary unless you need to search in directories that you do not have access to. Searching in hidden directories does not require elevated privileges, if that's why it's being used in your example.
