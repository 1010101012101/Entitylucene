External corrupted, now looking to restore iTunes and photos library from cloud <body> I had an external hd with my iTunes media folder and my photos database. I'm running Yosemite or elcapitan on a 2008 iMac.   I had a second external as a time machine back up. I was sure that I had the first external included in the backups. Apparently not.   The first external died and I went to the time machine backup and can't find any evidence of the first external being backed up.   That leaves me with a matched iTunes library in the cloud and a photos library also in the cloud.   My question: can I get my iTunes media back on my Mac locally via iTunes Match service?   Can I get my photos library back out of the iCloud copy?  If so how?  I have bought a new hd and it's ready to go. Should I start a new photos library on it and will the content automatically download?  If I open iTunes I see a song list but it can't find the media. Should I amend the library by setting a new place on the new disc for media and then select all and set them to download? Will it do that if it expects to find the songs locally?   Any ideas folks??
