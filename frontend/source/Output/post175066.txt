Magic Trackpad stuck battery <body> I have a Magic Trackpad that sat unused in a work drawer for a few months. Like a total noob, I neglected to remove the batteries.  I recently reconfigured my workspace and decided to start using trackpad once more, but to my horror, the batteries had corroded and the one furthest in, is very very stuck.  I have tried a long neck, thin screwdriver to try and pry away some of the corrosion around the edge, and lot of banging/ knocking/ cursing, but the battery is still in place.  I welcome any suggestions on how I can remove the other battery and hopefully resurrect this trackpad into working order. I open to suggested chemicals/ power tools etc.  Many thanks in advance community!  <answer175071> So the gel containing battery acid has leaked out and dried up.  You need to make it muddy again to be able to remove it, since dry removal is not possible.  There are multiple methods to do that described here. (Vinegar, Lemon juice, and others).  Example:  Mix water and baking soda into a thick paste. Start with about a teaspoon of baking soda and add water a few drops at a time until it can be mixed into a thick paste.  Apply the baking soda paste generously to any corroded areas using cotton swabs. Allow the paste to sit for 15 minutes.  Use a slightly moistened toothbrush to gently agitate the paste. Rinse the toothbrush often, and continue until the majority of the paste has been scrubbed away. In hard to reach spaces use q-tip to deliver the paste.  Needless to say, use gloves!  <comment206305> In my experience, the stuff that leaks out of modern disposable batteries ("alkaline batteries") is a base, not an acid, and the right way to hydrate / neutralize it is vinegar. Is that incorrect? <comment206604> I'd just finished cooking some salmon when I saw the response from @Buscar, so I had a cut lemon "in-flight". A little fresh squeeze and a half dozen qTips later, I have a functioning trackpad! Thanks community!! Thanks Buscar.
