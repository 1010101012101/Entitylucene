Is there a Mac app similar to the iOS Utiful app? <body> The Utiful app is a complementary photo library for iOS devices, enabling easy and fast organization of photos in folders. You can freely move photos between the Camera Roll and the Utiful folders (yes, really move, not just duplicate like the Photos app), and you can also mark the folders with sticker labels for better orientation.  Is there something similar but for Mac?
