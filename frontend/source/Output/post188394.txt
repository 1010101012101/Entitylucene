Safari modify suggested url <body> Imagine I visited a website: codehttp://example.com/food/cake.html/code with the title emDelicious Cake/em. When I use Safari and start typing emDel/em, one of the suggestions shown by Safari might be the aforementioned website. If I hover over this site, my address bar will contain the title of the website: emDelicious Cake/em. I can visit the site by pressing enter, but how do I get Safari to just fill the URL into my address bar?  For example, if I wanted to visit codehttp://example.com/food//code, I want the address bar to contain codehttp://example.com/food/cake.html/code and then delete the codecake.html/code.
