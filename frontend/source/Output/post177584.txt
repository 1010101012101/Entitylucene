How to force Mac (Yosemite) to use USB Bluetooth instead of internal? <body> I'm on an older Mac Pro, and I bought the ASUS USB-BT400 so that I can use Yosemite's Handoff feature. The problem is, I don't know how to disable the internal Bluetooth and force my machine to use the USB Bluetooth instead. I searched around but didn't find anything that worked.  <answer177585> Continuity Activation Tool is a great app for doing all of the command-line stuff necessary to enable Continuity, and it claims to be able to work with USB dongles.  <answer177721> To force your system to use an external Bluetooth controller instead of the internal one, open Terminal and type:   precodesudo nvram bluetoothHostControllerSwitchBehavior=always /code/pre  then reboot. To revert to the default OS X behavior, type:  precodesudo nvram -d bluetoothHostControllerSwitchBehavior /code/pre  You may need to turn off (or un-pair) Bluetooth accessories that are currently using your internal Bluetooth controller, as they can prevent the dongle from being detected by the Continuity Activation Tool.  <comment210103> I know all about it. :) But it requires Bluetooth 4.0, which is why I bought this USB dongle which I can't get working. <comment210104> @CaptSaltyJack Are you on version 2.0.0? That's what I'm on, and after I press 1 for "Activate Continuity," it says it'll go with the dongle if it detects you plugging one in. <comment210105> Yeah, I run `contitool.sh -d` and it says `Verifying Bluetooth version...          NOT OK. Your hardware doesn't support Bluetooth 4.0, necessary for Continuity. Current LMP Version=4, expected 6.` <comment210106> How old is your Mac Pro? [This graphic](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dokterdok/Continuity-Activation-Tool/beta/CompatibilityChart-13.12.2014.png) from the developers shows what CAT can and can't do. <comment210107> Early 2009. USB 4.0 dongle is plugged in. <comment210109> When I ran "Activate Continuity," it said "If you want to activate Continuity using a USB dongle, then plug-it in now." Try unplugging it and then only plugging it in when prompted? <comment210110> Ok, will try. Let me ask: can I revert to all the standard kext drivers if something goes haywire? <comment210111> I have to reactivate Continuity every time I reinstall the OS or get a software update, so I assume an OS X reinstall would do the trick. <comment210118> Weird, it says the script will continue once it detects a USB BT 4.0 dongle, I plug it in, and nothing happens. <comment210120> That's strange. I'd recommend taking it up with [the developer](https://github.com/dokterdok). <comment210121> I probably have a dud dongle. :( I plug it in and I don't see it show up in the Apple system info. <comment210122> Oh, if the computer itself isn't detecting the dongle, that's probably it. <comment210123> Never mind, it's there. BCM20702A0. I'll hit up the developer and check back in later, thanks! <comment210144> Got it! This was documented in the issues page for CAT. I had to disable Bluetooth, plug in the dongle, enable Bluetooth, and then the tool worked. Handoff is working like a charm! <comment297157> this worked for me
