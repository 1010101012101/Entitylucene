Reset Network Settings on iphone4s <body> This phone is second hand. The iCloud account is still on previous owners name, I cannot do backups  I have done "erased network settings" Friday evenings and are without internet on my phone since Friday!! HOW DO I RECTIFY THE Problem??? I have tried to 'reset network settings' but it does not seem to work. The previous owners iCloud login details are still there. I use wifi now to communicate and it will not always be accessible  please advise!!  Thank you
