Is there anyway to add the Mic icon to the Swype keyboard? <body> I really like the 3rd party Swype keyboard, but it is missing the Mic button.  Is there a gesture or something to engage the Siri Microphone?  <answer163212> No, this is currently not possible due to restrictions with 3rd-party keyboards in iOS.  From Apple site:     Custom keyboards, like all app extensions in iOS 8.0, have no access to the device microphone, so dictation input is not possible.
