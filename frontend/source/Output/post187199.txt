Photos time and date differences on videos <body> On MacBook, video shows 22/05/14 2:26PM. On iPad, in Album view, it shows the same time and date. But in Collections view it says 23/5/14 12:26AM.  The video was taken in another time zone and I suspect that time and date in iOS Collections is the local time equivalent in my current timezone.   When I loaded all the photos and videos into Aperture I did force then into my current timezone (maybe in error). But the different handling between two different views in the iPad is strange.  Maybe this is fixed by changing to the original time zone in which the video was taken?
