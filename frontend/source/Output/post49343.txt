LaTeX- LaTable GUI did not show up on Mac <body> I downloaded a LaTable Mac Version but when I clicked on the file, the GUI did not show up. I am using MacBook Pro 10.6.  I am wondering if anyone is having similar problems or knows how to fix this? This is where I downloaded the package.  http://mac.softpedia.com/progDownload/LaTable-Download-79088.html  I also downloaded Darwin that supposedly help Mac run some Windows based program.  http://tug.org/pipermail/macostex-archives/2009-April/040025.html  http://www.kronenberg.org/darwine/  <comment56477> Are there any error messages printed to the terminal you used to start the program? <comment56478> No, nothing that I am aware of.
