Renaming the startup disks shown during boot <body> I'm dual booting OS X (Lion) and Arch Linux, and when I hold down "option" during the boot process, I am presented with both of my startup disk options (i.e., OS X and Linux); however, they are named "IluvatarHD" and "Windows". Does anybody know of a way to rename the "Windows" option to something more accurate.  I assume this is on the Mac OS X side as nowhere on my Arch install is the label "Windows"  applied.  In an ideal world, I would be able to change the disk icon as well...  NOTE: I've uninstalled refit as it's unnecessary once Arch has been installed and would rather keep using the Apple boot loader.  Any help would be appreciated!  <answer26005> I'm fairly certain this isn't possible.  The EFI boot loader just assumes that if it isn't an OS X partition then it must be Windows.  <answer79753> Try the following command in Terminal if you can mount the devices directly in MacOSX  precodesudo bless --folder "volume_path" -label "volume_label" /code/pre  Otherwise try the following option:  precodesudo bless --device "device_path" -label "volume_label" /code/pre  found it via apples man pages: Bless Man Page.  Hope it works.  <answer83930> Maybe I'm missing the subtleties here, but it should be as simple as:  precodediskutil rename /Volumes/oldvolumename newvolumename /code/pre  <comment52616> +1 for "IluvatarHD". <comment60120> I don't think this is true. <comment78252> Is it possible to cd into /Volumes via the Terminal and then use 'sudo mv Windows (or whatever it is called there) Arch Linux'?
