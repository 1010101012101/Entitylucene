My Macbook Air doesn't recognize my USB <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NxoRC.png" alt="enter image description here"  I've always used my USB on this computer. The only issue i would have is that it wouldn't always appear on screen, but i would just eject it and put it back in and it would all be ok. Today for some reason it wouldn't recognize it. I go in disk utility and it doesn't say anything (see image) i need to access this USB for work, so please someone help. I don't know a lot about mac, so please help with whatever you think you can.  <comment206188> it says it is empty ? but try running disk and permission repair on it.
