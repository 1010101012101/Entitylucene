How to set up an AirPort Express so another router can connect to it? <body> I have an Airport Express 802.11n 1st generation (in other words, the last one before they began to look like a white AppleTV).  I would like to have this as my main router and have a second router (Linksys WRT54GL v1.1) extend my network. Does anyone know how I can hook up the Linksys to the AirPort Express?  All the articles I find have the AirPort Express extending the network, but I can't do this since I want to have a VPN on the Linksys and only have some machines go through that. If the Linksys were the first point after the modem, everything would have to go through a VPN and be slowed down.
