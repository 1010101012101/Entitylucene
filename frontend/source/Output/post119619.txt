VLC and Chrome freeze on start <body> Since last week I can't open strongVLC/strong and strongGoogle Chrome/strong, it freezes immediately after opening. It's the report output for strongVLC/strong:  precodeDate/Time:       2014-01-29 23:10:52 +0330 OS Version:      10.9.1 (Build 13B42) Architecture:    x86_64 Report Version:  18   Command:         VLC Path:            /Applications/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/VLC Version:         2.1.2 (2.1.2) Parent:          launchd [645]   PID:             2225 Event:           hang Duration:        4.68s (process was unresponsive for 113 seconds before sampling) Steps:           47 (100ms sampling interval) /code/pre  Full output: http://tny.cz/18d1a0a9  Chrome also doesn't respond - could they be related?  The only thing I want is fixing this, not a fresh install of strongOSX/strong.  The machine is a MacBook Pro Mid2011 running OSX 10.9.1.  <comment139524> Reinstalling a clean OS would be a good troubleshooting step despite you saying you don't want to do that. You could install onto an external drive and first test the hardware, then next chrome and last VLC. it would rule out and narrow down some potential causes of your difficulties. <comment139534> Testing hardware? it's okay. I have a windows installed on Mac also, everything works fine there. <comment139535> I would say they are not related. Did it work before? <comment139538> yes they were working last week.
