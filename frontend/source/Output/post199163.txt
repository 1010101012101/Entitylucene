How does iOS and OS X detect when a Wi-Fi network is a personal hotspot? <body> When there is a Personal Hotspot network available, it displays a chain link icon instead of the usual lock icon in the list of available networks on iOS and OS X.  img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZEpYZG1.png" alt="Wi-Fi network selection dropdown in OS X"  My question is, how does OS X distinguish these networks? Is it specified in 802.11 how hotspots broadcast their SSID's differently?  <answer200854> Apple talks to Apple, they know their own products and know when it is an Apple device or not. Apple may have their own MAC Address range or they simply see all the information there is about this device, ie:  If you go to About this Mac, System Report, Network, Wifi. You will see the following details about this network/device.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ayCjg.png" alt="Wifi Details"  Check at interfaces: Card Type, MAC Address or Locale. These can possibly be all "Apple Identifiers". When making a hotspot with your iPhone, Apple decided to share the info with your Mac to show it's an Apple device.  <answer201723> The chain icon is showing that the internet connection is being bridged through another device. It is not specifically for personal hotspots.  <answer206770> I think this question should be posted in Reverse Engineering Stack Exchange site. You're asking for the implementation details about a black box...  In fact I did dig around a little on code/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu Extras/AirPort.menu/code and code/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreWLAN.framework//code  There is a private method of codeCWNetwork/code called codeisPersonalHotspot/code, kind of:  precodechar -[CWNetwork(Private) isPersonalHotspot](void * self, void * _cmd) {     eax = [*(self + 0x4) objectForKey:@"IOS_IE"];     eax = LOBYTE(eax != 0x0 ? 0x1 : 0x0) &amp; 0xff;     return eax; } /code/pre  It seems just checking some identifiers. I think codeSFRemoteHotspotDevice/code and codeWiFiXPCEventProtocol/code may have more low level details but I didn't check.  BTW, There is also a property to identify whether is CarPlay network  precode@interface CWNetwork : NSObject &lt;NSCopying, NSSecureCoding&gt; ... //redacted @property(readonly) BOOL isPersonalHotspot; @property(readonly) BOOL isCarPlayNetwork; ... //redacted /code/pre  Apple controls the Hardware, the Drivers and the Operating System, I guess they can easily add extra metadata when broadcasting the WiFi signal so your Mac knows to whether adding the chain icon or not.  If anyone figure out exactly how Apple did the trick, please let me know. :)  <answer212818> Also, hotpots on iOS are identified as 172.20.10.x, as well.  <comment238583> I gave you a + just because you made me laugh with the Exploded Rice :) <comment241012> Sounds like an opportunity to break out wireshark/promiscuous sniffer. <comment243062> I deleted my answer because [apparently an iPhone personal hotspot is not an ad-hoc network](https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/xzve0/anyone_know_what_the_chain_link_icon_is_for_in/c5rbhgp). I believe there is other data identifying the network as a personal hotspot but I don't have the specifics for an answer yet. (I am fairly certain that it is *not* based on MAC address as @emotality suggested) <comment243353> Apart from the fact that Wi-Fi connections are almost always bridged to another network device, this doesn't really explain why hotspots created on Android devices do not show up with a chain icon. <comment243602> I gotta say, I really doubted that this could be a possibility at first since none of that info except MAC is shared in 802.11, but after reading into it, I'm starting to think your theory could have some merit.Apparently, the first 3 octets of a MAC address indicates the manufacturer of the device, and Apple uses a separate manufacturer portion of the MAC address on all of its iDevices. <comment243603> Now if I could somehow spoof the BSSID of an access point so it shows up as an iDevice, I could possibly confirm or disprove this theory... Anyone know how this might be accomplished? (Or if it can be accomplished at all?) <comment243632> Lol no I dont think its a good idea to ask hacking questions here :P but you can mark answer as correct if it answered your question. :D <comment257005> I *BET* there is an Apple specific IEEE802.11 Beacon Frame extension that announces tethering, like others do (e.g. Ciscos CCX). Unfortunately I have no device to test with. <comment257007> You won't receive DHCP traffic unless you have associated with the AP. <comment370318> I think this is not the case. Even hotspots created using Android devices show the "chain" icon. <comment370319> On macOS Sierra, hotspots created using Android devices show the chain icon.
