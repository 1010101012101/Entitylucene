Logitech C615 web cam sound control <body> I have a Logitech C615 web cam with a built-in microphone. I want to use a headset with earplugs and a microphone for more private conversations. There are phone out and mic in plugs on my Mac Mini.  However, I can not turn the sound off on the web cam. I can mute it, but the headset mic will not work.  Is there a way to turn off the sound on the web cam, or do I need to buy another one without the mic?  <answer45283> You can easily change which device is used for audio input. Just hold down kbd⌥ Option/kbd while clicking on the Volume menu item:br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LTU97.png" alt=""  Alternatively, to get a bit more fine control, open System Preferences (found under   System Preferences…) and open the Sound preference pane:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tBz89.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment51629> I added the Sound pane in System Preferences. Hope that's all right by you. :)
