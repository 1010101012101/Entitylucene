What is spotlight indexing and should I turn it off? <body> So I want to know what indexing really does, from my understanding it keeps tabs on where all your documents are at. I use spotlight all the time to look for different files or to open programs, and I still want to be able to do this. However, I have a feeling that indexing is killing my SSD, so if I decide to turn it off, what is that going to do? Will I still be able to use spotlight or will it be "buggy"?  Thanks  <answer265751> Leave it on.  You use an OS that heavily depends on this, you need to allow it to index.   Yes, it keeps track of where all your documents &amp; data are. After any major OS update it will re-index from scratch; the rest of the time it will just periodically tick away in the background, interfering with nothing and helping a lot of the system.   SSDs are more resilient than people give them credit for. Yes, the more you use it the faster it will wear out, but a bit of file indexing is going to perhaps shorten its life by 20 minutes or so, overall ;-)  <answer265840> Yes definitely..My spotlight indexing only runs rarely. If I have a kernel panic reboot or I force a reboot it runs. If software update causes a reboot, I don't think it runs. I never notice it because I don't use it that often. I've found the right combination of shortcuts in my dock so that I probably only use spotlight a couple of times a week now. Spotlight is one of my favorite OS X things. If I want to run any app, all I need to know are a han you can dful of consecutive letters in the name of the app and it comes up almost instantly. Spotlight and quick view are two of my favorite things in OS X. There are only a handful of files quickview doesn't know how to open and I'm never faced with waiting for pages or openoffice.org to load up just to read the contents of an email attachment. On my windows boxes, I always shut off indexing because it is useless. I would never consider shutting off Spotlight indexing because it saves me time every time I use it.  <answer265841> If it's not causing any problems, no reason to disable it.  However, I had the case where 120 machines where indexing everything at the same time on an nfs mount. Horrible.  Please see below how to strongemdisable/em/strong/strongemreenable/em/strong/strongemdecide what to index/em/strong  strongDisable Spotlight/strong The primary method is using launchctl, this will require the administrative password:  precodesudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.metadata.mds.plist /code/pre  Another approach is to use the older indexing method of codesudo mdutil -a -i off/code which turns off indexing only, but more on that in a minute.  strongReenable Spotlight/strong The guaranteed way to reenable Spotlight is to reload it into launchd using launchctl:  precodesudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.metadata.mds.plist /code/pre  Source : http://osxdaily.com/2011/12/10/disable-or-enable-spotlight-in-mac-os-x-lion/  It's working on MacOS Sierra and El Capitan (even if the article says Lion)  <comment333353> Could you provide an authoritative reference to the "_a bit of file indexing is going to perhaps shorten its life by 20 minutes or so, overall_" comment? <comment333358> No. It was obviously a joke. You could try work it out from http://h20195.www2.hp.com/v2/getpdf.aspx/4AA5-7601ENW.pdf?ver=1.0 or similar sources. <comment333360> I know it was a joke, I saw the smilie face... sorry I forgot to put on on mine. :)  BTW There is no way of getting a figure that is realistic other then to say it's negligible in the overall life of the SSD as indexing is such a positive thing compared to not using it.
