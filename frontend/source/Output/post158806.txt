Macbook Pro, completely broken keyboard, can't login! <body> I have 15 inch macbook pro and the keyboard recently stopped working completely.  None of the keys work.  I got a wireless apple keyboard, to fix the problem.  The issue is that I need to login in order to set up the external keyboard, and since the keyboard is  broken, I obviously can't login. My trackpad still works though.    Is there a way to login if nothing on my internal keyboard works.  Please note, the answer can't be some sort of reset for which I need to push any keys - I have tried these, and they don't work, because the keyboard doesn't work.    Thanks!!    <answer158809> You could login as a guest user, if you've enabled that option. No password necessary!  <answer158817> You can't setup Bluetooth devices without logging in, USB keyboard is the only way to go. Bring you Macbook to school or work and use one of their keyboards for a minute to logon and pair the Bluetooth keyboard.  <comment186681> Wireless keyboard needs Bluetooth working. Bluetooth is not active until log in is completed. Solution would be to use SUB keyboard, since system does scan for USB device during boot.
