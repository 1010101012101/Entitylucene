How do I open TCP ports 7080 and 7090 for use with Merlin? <body> I'm trying to set up Merlin server on my Mac to send a GANTT chart to my iPad. I need to open TCP ports 7080 and 7090 for it to work. What's the best way to open those ports?  <answer104052> Have you looked at the firewall settings? (Apple menu - System Preferences - Security &amp; Privacy - Firewall Options...)  There you'll find options to block everything, to permit signed software to open ports to listen, and you can click on the '+' button to add a new application.  <comment122535> If no one guesses what you are stuck on, you might elaborate by editing the question why you feel the software just doesn't open the ports when you configure and run it.
