Listary for Mac <body> I use the strongListary/strong software everyday (most of the time) when I use Windows. Its features are  ul lifind folder and files as you type (in the current folder)/li lismart commands like emopen this directory in command prompt/em/li liaccess strongListary/strong from anywhere/li lifavorite and recent file and folder from anywhere/li lisupport (of above features) for various application/li /ul  You can see the features in action in this Listary features video screencast.  Alternativeto.net does not give any interesting alternative for mac.  I would like to know is there any app out there like that one for Mac?  <answer74528> Have a look at http://alternativeto.net/software/listary/?platform=mac, in particular Alfred, Quicksilver and LaunchBar.  <comment86883> You should first see the video link I provided first. Listary feature is different from Alfred, Quicksilver and LaunchBar. <comment91198> @TunWN I took the time to watch the video. As there are no "generic Windows lists" on the Mac, no Mac app will support them. Apart from this, all suggestions from MrMage are useful and fulfill the criteria you named -- the actual workflows may be a bit different though.
