How to disable auto-completion in Safari <body> I hate to use Private Navigation so I disabled history (locked the History.plist file) but when I enter words in my search, auto completion sometimes show somethings I'd rather not show to my friends / familly (ie. searching for "poker" and seeing "pornhub" appear. Do you know how to disable this ?  <answer178265> Try Prefs/Search - disable everything except search engine suggestions [which are 'live' not historical]  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Dn2q2.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment211526> Glad it helped :)
