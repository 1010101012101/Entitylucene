Graphics bug / visual glitch in macOS notifications <body> Recently I noticed a weird visual glitch in some of my notifications in macOS (Sierra). It looks like a misplaced shadow or dent in the background of the notification itself.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6vnIs.png" alt="screenshot of visual bug in macOS notifications, name blurred"  The symptom appears on the lockscreen as well as in regular mode. Interestingly this happened on my old MacBook (El Capitan) as well.  Does anybody know where this could be coming from and how to get rid of it?  <comment335683> Does it even bother you? It's just an element of the design... <comment335723> You are right. It is a very minute thing. Nonetheless I was wondering why it is happening sometimes and not at other ones. It seems wrong.
