Advice on securely removing malware <body> I'm helping out a friend who thinks they may have malware on their machine. I don't know what kind or to what extent, so I don't want to boot into the system. My question is:  ul liIs there a good boot time anti-malware like Avira Rescue Kit (which won't seem to boot on a Mac)?/li liOr, should I boot into the recovery partition, and run Malwarebytes?/li /ul  Thanks  <comment255361> Does your friend have a backup? Wiping and reinstalling is often the fastest and best fix. Also, disconnecting from the network neuters most malware enough to connect a drive and make a new backup / capture any user changes since the last backup. <comment255362> No, they don't have a recent backup. Obviously I don't want to make a new backup now because it could be infected. <comment255369> The nice thing is even if the backup is "infected" - it's often trivial to only copy over documents. OS X doesn't tend to get spreading ills - and once you disable the one bad actor, you're usually done with cleanup. <comment255371> Right but, I don't have a backup. I don't even know what the bad actor is of if it exists. Any other machine I would just boot from a linux disk and run malware bytes/avira. Is this not a viable solution for macs? <comment255374> Sure - boot to recovery and install a clean OS onto an external USB drive and then run what you wish. The tips and tricks you learned securing other OS may not apply so well on OS X, but you accomplish that if you wish. <comment350186> I can't agree with @bmike more - wipe and reinstall is often the best course.  In lieu of that, (you didn't say which Mac your friend had), I would buy another drive, a USB enclosure for that drive, do a fresh install and copy over the files that you need.  When done, you now have a drive for backup.
