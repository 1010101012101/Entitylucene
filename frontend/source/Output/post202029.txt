Cannot Partition Disk with Disk Utility <body> I can't seem to partition my disk with Disk Utility or with the Terminal command (see screenshots).br Something also happened to my other partition running Mavericks, where it just turned into an "empty name" partition, but still runs fine.  Any help would be much appreciated  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OMOg8.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rmjYW.png" alt="enter image description here".  <answer202057> You could try booting into internet recovery (hold Command+Option+R during boot) once there open disk utility and try partitioning again.
