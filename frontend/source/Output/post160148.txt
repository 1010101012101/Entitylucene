iMessage picture <body> So a friend of mine sent me a photo about two months ago and when I went looking for it after I saved it I found it in my June time line not October as it should have been. Does this just mean the picture was taken by my friend in June or is there an issue with my iPhone moving my photos?   <comment188276> Is there a date ? <comment188388> No it's of a photo they took a picture of then when they sent it it saved to my june roll. I was just wondering since I got the text in oct but it saved to june does that mean they took it in June? <comment188392> not sure possibly, but if you right click on the photo and then use the Get Info maybe it shows it. <comment188429> No it was sent in an iMessage so no right click
