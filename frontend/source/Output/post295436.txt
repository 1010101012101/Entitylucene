Why is Google Photos saving all my iPhone pics as short :01 videos (live photos)? <body> I am running iOS 11 beta on my iPhone 7+. When pics are backed up to Google Photos they are all being saved (or at least viewed) as one-second or two-second videos (live photos). Why is it doing this? In the past, they were saved as regular photos with the option to make them live. Is there a way to turn off the live photo option? I want pics, not videos. Thanks.
