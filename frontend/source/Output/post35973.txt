Keyboard option keys work as command keys <body> I have a interesting Option Key problem  but I couldn't find any solution.  I am using iMac 21,5" and running Mac OS X 10.6.8 Snow Leopard.  My keyboard is apple  wired aluminum extended keyboard  and my layout is "Turkish QWERTY PC". My problem is both Options key work as Command key and , I cant type special characters.  I  opened Key Viewer and when i press option key  it shows as Command Key.   Note : I have a logitech g500  mouse    Note2 : I tried 3 diffrent keyboard ( Microsoft, logitech and apple ) result is same.  Note3 :   system prefs/keyboard/keyboard/modifier  buttons are default , and when i changed control button  to option button and press the control button its type command button again.   Is there any solution to fix this?   Thanks a lot.  <answer36448> Do you have the Logitech Control Center (LCC) software installed?  if so uninstall it and see what happens.
