MacBook Air 11" 2012 "Unable to write to the last block of the device" <body> I bought a second hand MacBook Air 11" 2012 Model A1465 without SSD that was water damaged but runs... In order to make it run for cheap I bought 256GB M.2 SATA 3 NGFF SSD and a compatible M.2 to MacBook Air 2012 SSD adaptor. Now when I try to Partition or Erase the newly installed SSD using Disk Utility my MacBook Air gives error "Unable to write to the last block of the device" and sometimes "Wiping volume data to prevent future accidental probing failed"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xNkLW.jpg" alt="Unable to write to the last block of the device"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ibRBZ.jpg" alt="Wiping volume data to prevent future accidental probing failed"  To make sure that my MacBook is working otherwise I ran windows 10 using my external USB drive and it works perfectly.  Please help me find the solution of my problem. . .
