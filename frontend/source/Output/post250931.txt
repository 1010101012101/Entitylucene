I have an iphone 4s and it wont unlock <body> I have an iphone 4s, and it will not unlock, using my normal pin. I took it to a computer store, but they want 60$/hr for a 4hour minimum of work. This is more than I can afford.   Is there any other way to get this phone unlocked? I do not want to do a factory reset, there are pictures, and phone numbers, that I do not want to loose. I looked around on other sites, and those sites look sketchy.   I don't want to jail-brake the phone, I just want to get my files, and be able to use it again.  <answer250932> There is no other way to unlock your phone other than to do a factory reset / restore backup.  You can have your local Apple Store employees help you, or if you change your mind, you can follow one of these two Apple support pages on factory resetting / restoring a backup of your phone.  ul liErase and reset your phone to factory settings/li liRestore a backup of your iPhone/li /ul  Good luck!  <comment311796> Do a back up first, then restore after it's unlocked. <comment311837> I live in Maine, I think the Closest Apple Store is Boston or something. <comment311838> @j0h Try the Maine Mall. I live in the Portland area, it is close to there. <comment311841> Brewer ME, pretty interesting. And thats a heck of a lot closer than Boston <comment311843> @j0h Glad I was able to help â€“ good luck!
