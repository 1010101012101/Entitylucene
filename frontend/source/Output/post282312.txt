Suggestions for a good vector editor <body> I'm new to macOS (Sierra) and am searching a simple vector editing tool.   Previously, on Linux I used Inkscape. However, on Mac the base on XQuartz is hard for me to use.   Does anyone know of a better alternative?  <answer282317> there is a native  mac version  otherwise I recomend Afinity Designer inkscape dmg  <answer284599> strongSketch/strong is my favourite vector editor, providing all the features you could want in a vector editor, supporting import and export of vector content in a variety of formats.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/64t8Q.jpg" alt="" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KLggh.jpg" alt=""  <comment355513> Have you seen this site? http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/best-vector-software-mac-designers-budget/ <comment355533> This is the version that runs on XQuartz that OP is specifically saying they don't like.
