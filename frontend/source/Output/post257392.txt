PDF document with notes has yellow squares, can't remove them <body> I have a PDF document with a lot of notes. There is a yellow square in every note, and if I remove the note using the inspector, the yellow squares doesn't go away:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MtvRX.png" alt="enter image description here"  I need to print this document and it's unusable with all these yellow squares.

Nothing was left behind from the deletion of the notes. The only yellow remaining in the document is in the signature field however this is not a _note_ nor did I see a way to change it. I've uploaded a modified copy of the [linked document here](http://docdro.id/pKME7Qi). <comment322762> I've found out what was the problem: if I delete a note, the yellow square doesn't disappear. But if I save, close and reopen the document I don't see it anymore. It's probably a bug.
