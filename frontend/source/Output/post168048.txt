Batch repack of mkv files <body> Can anyone tell me how to batch repack a bunch of mkv files to mp4 keeping the same file names using the Mac command line.  <answer168055> ul liGet Handbrake and its command line tools/li liOpen Terminal, change into the folder containing the mkv's and run  precodefor i in *.mkv; do     HandBrakeCLI -Z Universal -i "$1" -o "${1/${1##*.}/mp4}" done /code/pre/li /ul  <answer168112> For ffmpeg use the following command.  precodefor i in *.mkv; do ffmpeg -i "$i" -codec copy "${i/${i##*.}/mp4}"; done /code/pre  This should create copies of all your MKV videos, converting the containers to MP4 format but not re-encoding the video and audio data within them and keeping the same filename but changing the extension from mkv to mp4.  <comment197109> Apologies, I'm using ffmpeg is the sytnax the same ? <comment197113> What does "batch repack" mean to you? mkv and mp4 are just containers so is there to be no transcription of the video/audio or are you looking for something like a command line interface to handbreak to re-encode them differently? (basically it's hard to tell which of the two tasks you need help with initially - conversion or scripting) <comment197118> I have no experience with `ffmpeg` but the basic for loop is definitively the same. As for the specific parameters required by `ffmpeg` a look into the man page should help here. <comment197141> Repack means to me changing the container from mkv to mp4 and not re encoding. Its the scripting I require help with.
