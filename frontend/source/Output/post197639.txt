My mac laptop randomly plays music and won't stop <body> My mac randomly plays my iTunes music while I'm watching a movie or just using my laptop. I can't stop it because iTunes is never actually open. I've tried opening iTunes and playing music but they both seem just to play over the top of each other. The only way to stop the music is to restart the laptop   <answer198258> Are you wearing Apple EarPods/Earphones with an inline remote? If you press the center button on them anytime it will play a song from iTunes.  <answer295193> Are you using your Apple TV remote? Older Mac laptops have an IR sensor that will respond to this.
