iTerm ZSH - Missing Right Prompt <body> I'm using oh-my-zsh and iTerm2. I've also enabled the zsh-vim-mode plugin from oh-my-zsh. One of the annoyances I've encountered is my right prompt (RPS1 &amp; RPROMPT) doesn't seem to show up. I'd like it to indicate what vim mode I'm currently in.  I'm using the robbyrussel theme. It seems my $RPS1 variable is set. I'm wondering if there's a configuration option I'm missing.  hr  strikeI'm running 10.7./strike  Same issue in 10.8.  <answer83493> Try wrapping your RPROMPT in single quotes. I've seen double quotes cause issues for others with their prompts before.  I would also ditch the precmd  setprompt process for the moment and just set RPROMPT directly to simplify for testing. Start with something like  precodeprecmd() {   ... } PROMPT=$'\n$(rb_prompt) in $(directory_name) $(git_dirty)$(need_push)\nâ€º ' RPROMPT='%{$fg_bold[cyan]%}$(todo)%{$reset_color%}' /code/pre  and refine from there.  <answer83530> After investigating - I found a few things that fixed this:  ol liI had some oh-my-zsh plugins that were setting RPS1 instead of RPROMPT - it seems that setting both caused neither to be shown./li liSetting RPROMPT in precmd also caused it to disappear./li /ol  <answer83710> Make sure that $RPS1 or $RPROMPT is not defined in one of your plugins. For example, the plugin codevi-mode/code defines $RPS1 inside an codeif/code statement. To test, disable ALL plugins inside your code.zshrc/code and see if that fixes things.  <comment95900> What is in your $RPS1? <comment95960> Could you please attach your .zshrc? <comment96000> https://github.com/jacobstr/dotfiles/tree/master/zsh
