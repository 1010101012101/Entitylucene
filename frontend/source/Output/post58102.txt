Is Pinch To Zoom in TextEdit feature available in Lion? <body> In Mountain Lion it is now possible Pinch To Zoom in files within TextEdit. I think this is a new feature in Mountain Lion.  I'd like to know whether it is available in Lion?  <answer58636> No, not at the moment.  They decided to remove it in Mountain Lion for some reason...but they'll probably add it back due to complaints.  <comment67509> They didn't remove this feature in ML.
