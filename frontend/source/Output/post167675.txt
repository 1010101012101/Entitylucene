https (ssl secured) local websites are not working in Safari and Chrome in Mac Yosemite. How can I fix this? <body> As a developer, I will be running and testing the web apps that I am developing locally.   But Chrome and Safari are not allowing me to hit my local server with SSL enabled.  https://localhost:8443/ is not working saying SSL error with the following error message.   I think,  it is something to do with adding my certificate to OS X Keychain Access,  but I couldn't figure what actually needs to be done!  Could some one please help me out!     SSL connection error Hide details Unable to make a secure connection   to the server. This may be a problem with the server, or it may be   requiring a client authentication certificate that you don't have.   Error code: ERR_SSL_PROTOCOL_ERROR   strongUpdate/strong  I was generating the self signed SSL keystore and certificate using the below command  precodekeytool -genkey -alias tomcat -keyalg RSA -sigalg SHA256withRSA -keystore /path/to/keystore -keysize 2048 -validity 365 /code/pre  My problem got resolved,  when I generated my self signed certificate with below simple command.    precodekeytool -genkey -alias tomcat -keyalg RSA -keystore /path/to/keystore /code/pre  I am not sure why!?  <answer167712> It's likely that the issue is with certificates for your server.  You probably don't have a SSL certificate for codelocalhost:8443/code (as it's unlikely that any CA is going to issue one for that hostname), so of course you're going to get certificate errors.  Either click through the certificate errors; or choose a valid domain that you control, get a certificate for it, and host your site on that domain.  If you have a certificate for your domain (codeexample.com/code) and you have a SSL certificate for that domain (e.g., for codewww.example.com/code), another thing you could try is setting up DNS (or your code/etc/hosts/code file) so that codewww.example.com/code resolves localhost (127.0.0.1).  This still might run into other issues, and really, it's better to just test it on the domain you have a certificate for or click through the certificate errors.  None of this is likely to be Mac OS X specific.  <answer167716> If your local web server is still using SSLv3 then current versions of Chrome will no longer connect to it.  Chrome (and I believe Safari) have removed support for SSL3 fallback to mitigate the POODLE vulnerability.  If you believe that your server may be still using SSL3 the do a quick Google of "POODLE SSLv3" to get more information.  <answer167997> For local testing you can use a Self-Signed certificate. Generate your own using codeopenssl/code utility or you can use this site selfsignedcertificate.com  You may add the generated certificate as trusted certificate under your browser settings.   <answer168005> Two things I would do:  ol liIf the service is listening on *:8443, then I would not call https://localhost:8443 but more https://MyMachineName:8443, because that enables me to/li liUse the company certificate and put a DNS alias in your /etc/hosts file, like  192.168.24.3 www.mycompany.com/li /ol  But it HAS TO BE the same name as in the certificate, the CN!  Beware: Every time you enter now "www.mycompany.com:8443" or "www.mycompany.com" Safari/Chrome would now redirect you to your local instance. :) Don't be irritated and don't call your Helpdesk when your company site is not reachable due to your local webserver being stopped. :)  Happy developping! :)  <comment196665> We are using TLS protocol for SSL.    As my problem started some time in December 2014, when I took the latest chrome update ( which was when google disabled support for SSL 3.0 in their chrome update 39 ),  Seems like you are right,  but I see sslProtocol="TLS"   in my server.xml of tomcat server.   Where else I can get to know,  what SSL version that I am using ? <comment197020> Thank you for the answer DW.   We did get a certificate for our original domain name. But I can't use that domain name,  when I am developing it in my local.  I can only call it with localhost or else my system name. Both are not valid domain names.  There should be a way to use while we are in the development mode right ?
