My iPhone doesn't accept the contraction "doesn't" as a correct spelling, why? <body> My iPhone at some point stopped accepting "doesn't" and "Doesn't" as correct spellings. It accepts other contractions. Why is this and how can I fix it? Is there something wrong with the spell checker?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8s4lZ.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment282396> Try resetting the dictionary.  You probably corrected a correction and confused it.  Settings  general  reset  reset keyboard dictionary. <comment282401> Good idea, but I have a lot of corrections in there... I don't really want to go through adding them all back. Perhaps I can just add "Doesn't" back? <comment282402> I guess... is there a way to retrain the spell checker to recognize "Doesn't"? <comment282403> Select "doesn't" as the correct word from the suggestions above the keyboard.  You want the far left choice in this case, I.e "doesn't" in quotes.  It may take more than once to take, and it may never get it as correctly as it did before.
