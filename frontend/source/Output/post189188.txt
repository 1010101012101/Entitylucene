Insert GRIDLINES in PowerPoint 2011 <body> Is it possible to insert GRIDLINES (not guidelines) in PowerPoint 2011? If so, how can this be done?  Edit: I'm looking for gridlines, as outlined in this post.   <answer189190> ol liTable Layout  New [choose range]/li liTable Style: No Style_Table Grid/li /ol  Then stretch the table to fit your slide  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Nxv5N.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment224251> what is the difference between guidelines and gridlines? <comment224253> This isn't exactly what I was looking for. You are essentially inserting a table, not gridlines and I'd rather not insert anymore objects than necessary on the slide. But thanks for the hack. <comment224257> I suspect the true answer is 'wait for Office Mac 2015" <comment224258> Yea, I don't think it's in 2011 :(
