Where did the "favorites" tab go? <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HOnyn.png" alt="enter image description here"  Normally there is a "favorites" tab on the left side where I can easily navigate from folder to folder...where did it go? Not sure if this is just me being stupid and accidentally disabling it, or if it disappeared on me when I updated to El Capitan.  <answer213373> Check the strongFinder Preferences/strong to see if you have anything selected under Favorites.  From the strongFinder Menu/strong  ul liSelect strongFinder  Preferences.../strong/li liSelect the strongSidebar/strong tab/li liTick the boxes under Favorites that you wish to see in the Sidebar./li /ul  The strongSidebar/strong is the area on the left side.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/upggf.png" alt="Finder Preferences - Sidebar"
