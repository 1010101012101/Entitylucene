Why does my iPod say "this operation could not be completed" when I try to play any video on my iPod 4th gen? <body> My iPod is not playing any videos, not from YouTube or any video playing website. It seems that my video player in my iPod may be messed up. How do I fix that? Can I even fix that?  It's not my internet because the rest of my family can play videos just fine, and it's not YouTube because I checked on other websites, and also on my computer. I already tried refreshing my internet (I have Safari) and I can't do a reset because the iPod's power button is jammed and unusable.
