Delete unnecessary files in /System/Library for Mac OS X <body> I happen to have some unused/obsolete python libraries in System directory, especially in code/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Extras/lib/python/code, the issue is that I can't delete any file in the library anymore. I guess it's happening after upgrading to 10.11.  I tried codesudo rm -rf/code, but I emjust can't/em delete any file in it.   precodepython&gt; sudo rm -rf *.pyc Password: rm: easy_install.pyc: Operation not permitted rm: pkg_resources.pyc: Operation not permitted rm: pylab.pyc: Operation not permitted rm: pyparsing.pyc: Operation not permitted rm: six.pyc: Operation not permitted /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qCG7l.png" alt="enter image description here"  What might be done to remove them?  <answer214540> The directories are protected by codeSystem Integrity Protection/code in OS X El Capitan.   In order to disable it:  ol liReboot &amp; hold kbd Cmd âŒ˜ /kbd kbd R /kbd at the chimes/li liOpen Terminal/li liType codecsrutil disable; reboot/code/li /ol  Hints from http://osxdaily.com/2015/10/05/disable-rootless-system-integrity-protection-mac-os-x/  It isn't advisable to actually do this, however. Deleting files in the System directory could have unforeseeable and potentially disastrous consequences.  <answer214552> Do not touch the System directory! Those are files that the system may or may not need in the future (or currently). OS X uses Python, so just because you may not need the module, doesn't mean that OS X doesn't. Really, this is why they created SIP in the first place.  <answer214599> These emaren't/em your files. You absolutely emdo not/em understand what you are doing. Other people have already told you this, but not what you actually need to do instead.  Here is a decent rundown on how to set up your own parallell python installation with Homebrew, and then virtualenv on top of that so you don't run into conflicts.  The only reason anyone should ever touch /System is if they're running a hackintosh.  Edit: using pip with virtualenv is what you should do by default anyways. It's not a last resort for when you run into issues.  <comment259096> I given a +1 for answering the question correctly and giving a reference etc, but I think you might add "DON'T DO THIS UNLESS YOU ***REALLY*** KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING!!!!" <comment259110> +1 These files are NOT "unused/obsolete", they're part of a standard install of El Capitan and should not be messed with. I would disagree with this being the reason SIP was created, though -- it's not really intended to protect users from themselves, it's primarily a security layer to limit the kinds of damage malware can do if it gets root. <comment259111> Well, I'd say there were at least a few reasons. Certainly it's hugely advantageous as a layer that protects the system from processes that do bad things with root access, but the amount of people I see on the internet asking for help with what's analogous to surgery on a computer, who seem to know very little about the computer they're operating on, tells me that SIP will, without a doubt, result in a great decrease in a large portion of common corruption scenarios. <comment350735> 6 months later and the answer to every question is "Disable SIP and then you can do the thing you want to."
