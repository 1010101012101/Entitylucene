Separate bank account for second app? <body> I am developing an iOS application for a business associate of mine. Is it possible to associate a second bank account for the revenues of that application? Or do all funds generated from a single Apple ID flow into a single bank account?  <answer162431> You can't associate a bank account with an app.   You could have different bank accounts for every single contract you sign with apple:  ul liiOS Paid Applications/li liiAd App Network/li /ul
