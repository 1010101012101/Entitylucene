MacOS Server Caching Service, Receving Requests, but Not Caching <body> Yesterday I added two Mac Mini's to as caching servers. The network already had a single caching server. MacOS Server installed fine, I turned on the caching service on each, they all peered up together without issue. The logs also indicate that they both registered fine. However, so far, neither of the new ones have been doing any caching.  I've compared the settings between the original caching server and the two new ones, and they're identical. I've verified that all devices involved have the same public IP address. Everything operates behind a NAT and standard Internet connectivity seems to be fine.  The original caching server sits at the center of the network while the two additional caching servers have been added to buildings in the hope of decreasing traffic externally from those sites. The original server continues to work and the only distinguishable difference is that the original server is running an older version of OS X and Server.  In /Library/Server/Caching/Logs/debug.log I'll see lines like:     2017-01-05 10:41:17.300 #tHF4A5L2MFC/ Cache query from 192.168.3.122:49654 for asset /031-89972-2016111-D7D9C902-A54A-11E6-9D49-2EB6F9858D7F/com_apple_MobileAsset_CoreSuggestions/64cc1f3e1a54376ec6609c70dcb92d46802b093.zip      2017-01-05 10:41:17.300 #tHF4A5L2MFC/ Asset /031-89972-2016111-D7D9C902-A54A-11E6-9D49-2EB6F9858D7F/com_apple_MobileAsset_CoreSuggestions/64cc1f3e1a54376ec6609c70dcb92d46802b093.zip: not in cache   This suggests to me that clients are seeing the caching server and asking for assets, but the caching server doesn't seem to be going out and caching them. Any thoughts on what I should check with this?
