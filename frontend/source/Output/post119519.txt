Built in FTP client (cmd + k) - can't upload files (Mavericks) <body> I have just found out that I can enter a built-in FTP client on my Mac by simply pressing kbd^ Ctrl/kbd + kbdK/kbd. Great thing!   But after I have successfully connected to my server and a 'folder' with files located there appeared, it occurred that I can't upload files by simply drag &amp; drop'ing them. When I checked the 'Get info' I saw that it is marked as 'You can only read', yet the ftp account itself is okay, because I could upload files there from dreamweaver (unfortunately I have only Windows licence for this app).  Why is it marked as 'You can only read' and how do I fix that?  Please help!  P.S. Could you explain it in an easy way? Because I'm new to Mac (just bought one few days ago).  <answer119521> The built-in ftp is read only since forever unfortunately. From Mavericks help:     Servers and shared computers that you can connect to      You can connect your Mac to the types of servers and other computers   listed here.      ...      ul   liFTP servers/li   /ul      With read-only access, you can copy files from the server, but to copy   files to the server you may need another FTP app. Choose Apple menu    App Store to find FTP apps available for OS X.   Maybe try the free Cyberduck or (not free) Transmit.  <answer119522> The FTP feature of Finder only has Read-only access.   The possibilites you have :   ul liThe command line codeftp/code from the terminal /li liCyberduck, a Free App also available on the Mac App Store/li liTransmit, (my favourite) a 34$ FTP-App which has a nice feature : It can mount ftp servers like you can mount external drives. /li /ul  <answer119524> OS X builtin ftp client in Finder is read-only.

Logged in with the proper credentials and had read/write access.  <comment139403> Thanks :). Btw. Why would I need an FTP client that could only read files ;___;? <comment139405> Well, it's Apple, maybe this way they don't have to work too much on this "feature". Also see http://osxfuse.github.io and http://macfusionapp.org <comment139430> Ok, MacFusionApp doesn't work with Mavericks, even the updated 2.0.5 version made by someone else. :( <comment250509> I'm not sure what version of MacOS you are using, but on Yosemite a bare IP address is treated as a windows SMB share. <comment279495> ok, so just another mac bug. Think different!
