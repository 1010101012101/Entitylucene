How to scan from my HP-1610 (all in one) networked printer/scanner (Lion) <body> I have an HP-1610 all in one.  It's hooked up to my TimeCapsule as a networked printer.  Networked-printing works.  I'm on Lion (latest; 10.7.3 as of this writing.)  I'd like to scan a sheet from my printer and get it onto my desktop (or wherever.)  I tried opening Preview.app and codeImport From Scanner -&gt; Include networked devices/code, but the scanner never shows up in the popup menu.  I tried "Share scanner" in sharing preferences.  Oddly, in Print &amp; Scan preferences, there is no "scan" option.  I think that's the bit I'm missing.  Hints?  Thanks!  strongEDIT:/strong In Print &amp; Scan prefs, my instance of the printer for when it's hard-wired has Print/Scan tabs but, for the networked one (the same printer appears in the list 2x), there is no Scan, only Print.  Same thing when I open the print queues.  <answer48344> Use Image Capture (ApplicationsImage Capture). Select the printer from the sidebar: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yxBfA.png" alt="image capture"  <comment55399> Thanks, but no-joy.  See edit-comment at end of question.  Yes, for the hard-wired version of this printer, I get those tabs.  No tabs for networked printer. <comment55400> @Olie Edited answer again... <comment55401> As with previous edit: scanner does not show in sidebar of ImageCapture.  I'm pretty sure that the problem is that Lion doesn't know that my HP-1610 can scan or, for some other reason, my scanner isn't shared.  Obviously, your Epson works as expected.  I believe my problem is at a lower level, though. <comment55402> @Olie That is odd. Try removing, then re adding the printer. That fixes most problems for me. <comment66053> Hmm, nope, sorry.  I'll wait a couple of weeks to make sure it's not reported as terribly broken, then try on Mountain Lion.  Maybe it's a 1610 driver thing. <comment66057> Weird. Lemme know how it goes. <comment79560> http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c01925005&tmp_track_link=ot_faqs/top_issues/it_it/c01925005/loc:1&cc=it&dlc=it&lang=it&lc=it&product=306888&task=#N194
