Prevent Outlook meeting requests from auto-deleting <body> How can I prevent accepted meetings from being deleted in Office 2011?  When I accept a meeting in Outlook 2011 for Mac, it always automatically moves the invitation to deleted items. I'd prefer to see the invitation in my inbox indefinitely.  There are how-to guides describing how this can be fixed in Windows machines, but I've explored (I think) all the nooks and crannies of the preferences menu on my Macbook and can't find any equivalent setting in Office 2011 for Mac.  <answer142526> Unfortunately, this feature is not currently available in Outlook 2011. Personally I think it was a huge mistake to omit this feature in the Mac version of Office 2011.  The best you can do is to send your feedback by clicking codeHelp/code  codeSend Feedback.../code in any Office application, or by clicking on this link. However, if your feedback is taken into consideration, this feature will most probably be added only to future versions of Office for Mac.

Steps that work on my version of Outlook.  ol liCreate an Invitations folder. /li liHighlight message that is a meeting invite/li liClick on the "Organize" toolbar/li liClick on the "Rules" icon/li liOn the little menu that pops up, click "Create Rule..."/li liOn the rules dialog, the first field will say "From". Change that to "Kind". /li liThe next box will say "Encrypted" (as in Kind is Encrypted). Change that to "Meeting Request"/li liUse the minus sign to delete the sent to and subject rules (the next two rows)/li liChange "Do the Following" from "Move to Folder" to "Copy to Folder"/li liChange the folder name to "Invitations" or whatever you called it in step one/li liUncheck the box "Do not apply other rules..."/li liClick ok/li /ol  <answer278657> Actually I found a work around for this! If you go to your calendar and right click on the greyed out calendar entry that shows up (this is automatically done by outlook) and accept the request from the drop down menu (or tentatively accept or decline, whatever the case may be), it will go into your calendar and the actual email request will still be in your mailbox.  <comment312975> Can you provide a bit more detail on the steps you would take to set that rule up? <comment312982> @gentlemanhog tried to put some steps in there, sure it is different in every version of Outlook for Mac as they break it in different ways each time. <comment326163> Works for me in Outlook for Mac 15.24 - thanks.
