How can I tell whether an iOS game/app saves its data to iCloud? <body> I'd like to delete a game off of an iOS device but I would prefer to not lose my progress in case I want to return. Is there any way of checking whether the game/app puts the game save either in iCloud or another external service?  <answer245520> You can see a list of apps using iCloud storage from the Settings → iCloud → Storage → Manage Storage menu. But even if your app is listed, there's no way of checking exactly what data is saved.   <answer245521> If you back up the iDevice via iCloud, the game data will be saved there. You can also use iExplorer on a Mac or Windows machine.

What game do you want to delete though?
