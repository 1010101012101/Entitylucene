How to set up Safari to always show status bar <body> I am using Safari 6.0.2 (8536.26.17) within Mac OS X 10.8.2.   I would like to know how to set Safari so that, whenever a new window is opened, the status bar is always turned on.   I think this used to be a preference setting but it doesn't appear to be available in this version.   Whenever I open a new window, there is no status bar.  I know how to use the keyboard shortcut to turn it on and off. I'm looking for a way not to have to use the shortcut each time.  Is this doable? Thanks for your advice.  <answer74290> I think I found a command-line solution, opening up the Terminal and typing in the following:  precode$ defaults write com.apple.Safari ShowStatusBar -boolean true /code/pre  <answer85278> Odd, because I have the Status Bar visible, and every time I open a new window, it is visible. I wonder if you don't have some kind of extension causing yours to not show. The View  Show Status Bar command is not for each window, but is global, so it should work all the time.
