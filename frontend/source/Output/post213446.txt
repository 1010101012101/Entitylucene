Need some advice/solutions on having 2 external displays set up <body> I have a 2015 13" Retina MacBook Pro that comes with 2 Thunderbolt ports and an HDMI port.  I have 2 monitors which have same resolution (1920x1080) and same size, and they also only have DVI and VGA ports (no HDMI ports on both monitors).  I have already connected one of the monitors to my rMBP via a Mini DisplayPort to VGA adaptor. I'm looking to connect the other monitor using a Mini DisplayPort to DVI adaptor.  Now, is there any problem with using different formats of adaptor in this case? Are there any problems/obstacles to set up both external monitors using 1 VGA and 1 DVI adaptor to Mini DisplayPort?  <answer213454> strongTL;DR;/strong  No.  strongLong Version:/strong  Nope.
