Keyboard shortcut for Spotlight doesn't work in full screen Google Chrome on Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion) <body> I've noticed that the Spotlight Search keyboard shortcut (cmd space) doesn't work if I'm running Google Chrome (12.0.742.122) as full screen application in Lion.  Is this a Chrome-related bug or is this inherent of some type of applications? Is there a way to fix it?  <answer18721> No such problem with Safari (just tried it). the way to fix it: just switch to safari :P it's the same webkit rendering engine as chrome (meaning it's the same speed) and now it's a whole lot nicer with some of the new lion features  <answer18724> Chrome doesn't currently support Lion's full screen features. They are working on a version that does.  Until that is finished, you'll have to use Chrome's built-in full screen capabilities (not based on Lion's).  You can change the keyboard shortcut to enter that the same way you'd change any other (System Preferences- Keyboard- Keyboard Shortctus- [+] button  <answer62889> Problem seems to be resolved in newer Chrome versions.  <comment20085> reproduced on 10.6.8. problem seems to lie with chrome though. <comment20487> Actually, Chrome uses many technologies that make it faster than Safari. People have reasons they use the browser they do. I don't think this really answers the question. <comment20488> to each his own <comment20500> One word: Safari misses Chrome's Omnibox. It's a dealbreaker for me (among other things).
