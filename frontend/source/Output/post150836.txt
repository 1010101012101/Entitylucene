How do I do a clean install of Yosemite? <body> I'd like to start from scratch with Yosemite. I have Mavericks running on my iMac now but I'd like to just wipe the system and start with a clean Yosemite install.  How do I do a clean install of Yosemite on my machine, not an upgrade install?  <answer150837> I downloaded the OS X Yosemite GM from the App Store.  Quit the installer that pops up with out installing and made a bootable flash drive with it on it.  Used the following command below just change the paths to fit your need.  precodesudo /Applications/Path to *Yosemite Installer*.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/*FlashDrive* --applicationpath /Applications/Path to *Yosemite Installer*.app --nointeraction /code/pre  Then booted the computer to the usb flash drive and wiped the previous partitions using Disk Utility.app and installed a fresh copy.  <answer150840> I'd use a new HD, if you are ever thinking you may need to revert.br Yosemite appears to make your boot drive into a Core Storage Volume, making repartitioning difficult.  <comment177521> Stop flagging this. Yosemite is public now. <comment177524> Not going to open up my iMac for this, but thanks. <comment177526> This would be an even better answer if you mentioned how to get my data back on to it after doing the clean install. <comment177527> ahh... iMac, fair enough. There's no way Yosemite is going onto my old boot drive in the foreseeable future. This may be the first time I've ever held off a new release - because even though I've 5 drives in here, only one is an SSD, my current boot drive, & I don't want to break anything before the initial flurry of 'oops & fixits' is over. Previously I've just cloned to a spare in case of unexpected 'oopses' <comment177528> Getting your user data back from Mavericks onto Yosemite after you do a clean wipe? <comment177529> Yes. That's what I mean. <comment177551> I would say copy what you want to an external drive or make a Time Machine Backup that you can dig through.  I think doing a clean upgrade install is a tedious job if your looking to bring back certain pieces of an older OS IMHO.
