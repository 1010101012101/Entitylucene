Are "ejected" drives still unlocked? <body> If I eject an encrypted (with FileVault) drive in Mountain Lion, has it been locked, or is there more I need to do (like physically unplugging it)?  <comment70480> When I check the ejected drive using `diskutil coreStorage list` the drive is indicated as "Unlocked". Is it still accessible without a password to someone with access to my machine?
