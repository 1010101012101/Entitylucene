Certificate signed by an unknown authority in keychain after upgrading to El Capitan <body> I've found a random certificate in my keychain after upgrading to El Capitan‎ on both my Macs. It's called "ENTIDAD PUBLICA EMPRESARIAL RED.ES". It's showing a warning that it was signed by an unknown authority.  Does anyone know what this is used for?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sNl1B.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer212010> Red.es seems to be a Spanish telecommunications provider. They say they're "responsible for the .es TLD:     Dominos ".es" is responsible for managing the Internet Domain Names Registry for the country code ".es". The registry management tasks include processing applications and assigning new domains.      It is a part of the public business entity Red.es.   ICANN seems to agree. It looks like they sell their own SSL certificates for domains, and so they'd need a root certificate on your computer - otherwise, your browser would complain.   If you don't visit .es websites often, I'd be inclined to disable that certificate. It's one more company that, if infiltrated, their root certificate could* be used to impersonate any website. Like, say... this one.  hr  sup*I'm not entirely sure about that last one, I'm not an expert on certificate chains. It's possible that this root CA is only valid for code*.es/code  domains. Not sure./sup  <answer212019> You may check the validity of the certificate including the certificate chain  here:   DigiCert® SSL Installation Diagnostics Tool    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Dpg7R.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  or here:   Check your web servers encryption  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mzLRA.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Both checks show the same chain with different results though:  The certificate emENTIDAD PUBLICA EMPRESARIAL RED.ES/em as well as the intermediate certificate emAC Componentes Informáticos/em seem to be ok. SSL-Tools and OS X El Capitan can't properly detect the validity of the root certificate though.
