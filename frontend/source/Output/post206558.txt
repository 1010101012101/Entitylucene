How do I stop OS X attempting to import photos on each boot? <body> Everytime I boot my iMac up while my iPhone is attached it attempts to import photos, giving me a message as soon as I login about how it "can not import photos because the device is locked". This has started up in the last 3-4 days, presumably because of an OS X update (I'm on version 10.10.5).  I don't want it to try importing them on boot (and it's annoying getting this message on each boot), and I've already disabled various settings to stop it importing automatically when I connect my iPhone.   How can I prevent it from trying to import photos each time I boot my Mac up?  <answer206561> ul liConnect phone.  /li liLaunch Image Capture [in Applications]  /li liSet "Connecting this iPhone opens:" - No application/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PeGoh.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer206568> ol liConnect the iPhone and select it in Photos./li liUnselect Open Photos for this device  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Jf82A.png" alt=""/li /ol  <comment249053> Already configured like that, unfortunately. <comment249055> Already unchecked. It is something else causing it I think. Would be easier if OS X told me what exactly was trying to import. <comment249196> Is there any way to determine _which_ application is triggering the attempted import? Importing is disabled in both Image Capture and Photos. <comment251328> I've tried disabling Image Capture via CHMOD 000, and that doesn't work either. I still get this pop-up every day.
