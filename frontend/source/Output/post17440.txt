Can I disable the Lion animation when switching to/from fullscreen apps? <body> In Lion there is an animation when switching to and from full screen applications. Full screen apps are great, especially on a 11" screen, but this animation is getting very annoying. Is there a way to turn off these animations?  <answer18881> No..for now there is no way to turn it off. I also want to turn to the annoying animations when a new window appears.  <answer21761> You can disable the system-wide animation for opening new windows in Lion.  http://www.tuaw.com/2011/07/26/hackinations-5-really-good-lion-tweaks/  strongTurn off zooming windows/strong   Open Terminal and type the following:  codedefaults write NSGlobalDomain NSAutomaticWindowAnimationsEnabled -bool NO/code  Reboot.  <answer22038> There is, at least, a way to speed them up with a SIMBL bundle: http://www.yllier.net/SUFSA.html  <comment19567> Can we reopen the question now that it's officially out? <comment19579> We are not re-opening Lion questions that were asked before the official release. <comment19827> Apparently there is re-post prevention logic and it's smart enough to not allow another question with only minor differences. Can you reopen this? <comment19829> Done. Good luck! <comment24007> This doesn't impact the animations when an app is in full screen mode. <comment30168> This will not affect the animation the Dakku is asking about. It only disables a very subtle animation that occurs when a new window is opened.  It also does not require a reboot to take effect. Simply run the command like this:  defaults write NSGlobalDomain NSAutomaticWindowAnimationsEnabled -bool NO; killall Dock <comment70222> It gives me a 404 for the Dropbox URL :( <comment88809> I found SpeedUpFullScreenAnimation on this link.
