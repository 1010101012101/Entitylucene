Launch a bash script from the dock <body> I can't seem to figure this one out, there must be some really easy trick.  I have a bash script which sets my environment for an app and launches it with the correct parameters.  How can I put this script (or any script) on the dock?  Thanks,  <answer73601> Automator can be used to create an application "wrapper" around a script, so that you can launch your script like any other application (and it won't spawn a superfluous Terminal window in the process).  ol liOpen Automator, and create a new strongapplication/strong type workflow. /li liAdd a strongRun Shell Script/strong action, and enter your script into the text field./li liIf your script takes input (such as files), make sure the strongPass input/strong setting on the action is set appropriately (either arguments, if you use code$1, $2, etc./code or stdin). Otherwise you can ignore this setting./li liSave the workflow to your location of choice, then drop the resulting file in the Dock./li /ol
