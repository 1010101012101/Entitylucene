Boot to osx and windows both on external drive <body> My internal drive on iMac is broken. Screen is broken a bit as well, so it works without problems, but mac is not repairable anymore. So my decision was to buy external SSD and connect it via USB3.0 port.  OSX works well in this way. I can boot into it. The problem is with Windows that i need to install as well. Bootcamp can't install Windows on external drives.  There are few instructions like https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/239203/225459 that describes process step by step, but all of them describe how to install Windows on separate external drive. In my case both OSX and Windows need to be installed on the same drive.  I divided my disk into 2 partitions. One for OSX and one for Windows. Following the instruction above i succeed to install Windows on a separate second partition. The only problem is that i can't boot into it. When i performed "Run: bcdboot e:\windows /v /s e:" step it said that boot record is created. Holding option on restart doesn't show me that partition as bootable neither i can do that using Startup disk from System preferences and selecting Windows partition there to reboot into.  Any suggestions?  UPD: after some work on MBP/GUID restoration modification, rEFIt etc. i've ended up at stage were boot screen shows me Windows as a loading option, but when i try to load it shows Windows screen with the error  "Recovery Your PC needs to be repaired.  The application or operating system couldn't be loaded because a required file is missing or contains errors.  File: \windows\system32\winload.efi  ..."  Something like https://wpcf.neosmart.net/sites/5/2015/01/winload-efi-0xc0000225-windows-8.jpg  At the same time it loads well through VMWare as a bootcamp virtual machine.  <comment343799> Have you considered buying a 2nd drive. <comment343802> It is perforable to use this one. I've bought 1TB drive to have enough space for both systems. So if it is possible i would like to use it as it was planed.
