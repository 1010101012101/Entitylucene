Apple Sierra Screen captures - change date format in file Name <body> Is there a way I can edit code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.screencapture.plist/code so that a screen capture is returned using my emdefault UK date and time setting/em (Day/Month/Year)? The US style of Month/Day/Year is very confusing.  <comment369894> It ought to be *yyyy/mm/dd* which files alphabetically by date very nicely - is yours not? <comment369927> `System Preferences  Date & Time  Date & Time tab  Open Language & Region ...` button should allow you to set the system default Does this not work?
