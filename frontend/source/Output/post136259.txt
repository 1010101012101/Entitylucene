How to find errors in Excel for Mac 2011 in a large sheet? <body> For Excel for Windows, there's an option to search a sheet for errors and go straight to them, under the "Find and select" icon in the ribbon.   Excel for Mac 2011 doesn't have a "Find and select" ribbon icon.  On a sheet without thousands of cells, how can you scan it for errors?  <answer136260> It's similar to in Windows, but slightly more buried. codeEdit &gt; Go To.../code, then click codeSpecial/code, then select codeErrors/code under codeFormulas/code. Then look for the selected cell in the strongbottom left/strong of the screen.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fSLTH.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lPdEE.png" alt="enter image description here"  Annoyingly there doesn't seem to be any "Go to next" option and it forgets the settings each time, so you need to do loads of clicks each error. If you need to check for erros often, might be worth trying to make a macro (not sure if this is possible).  <answer189517> Depending on what your workbook's displaying,    Edit  Find [#] (i.e. enter the hash sign # as your target text) Within: [Workbook] Search: [By Rows] Look in: [Values]  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/97V5s.jpg" alt="screen cap of Find dialog"   may be less of a pain. In most of my workbooks, the only cells displaying the hash sign are error messages, and as far as I know, emall/em Excel error values (#DIV/0, #NAME?, #REF! etc.) display text starting with #. Even if you have dozens of hash signs in non-error cells, this will be a lot faster than having to wade through the Edit  Go Toâ€¦ dialog on every sheet.   If you want to search for errors without recalculating, you may have cells which display a calculated value that's destined to turn into an error. For example, enter =2+C4, then delete column C. If recalculation is set to manual, the cell will continue to show an unchanged value, but the formula will become =2+#REF! You can find cells in this state by changing the search parameter to Within: Formulas. This can stop recalculation from propagating a cascade of #REF! errors that takes a long while to unravel.  Hope this helps.
