Does Do Not Disturb mode turn off automatically? <body> If I turn on Do not disturb mode from control center, will it automatically turn off in the morning?  <answer209395> No, just flipping it on in Control Center won't get it to automatically turn off.  To get Do Not Disturb to automatically turn off, you need to schedule it to do so in codeSettings/code  codeDo Not Disturb/code  codeScheduled/code.  <answer209406> Go on Settings - Do not disturb ...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tr1j3.png" alt="enter image description here"  __  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iW262.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment252611> Additionally connecting the correct answers provided here back to your question, if you have a schedule AND turn it on early via the control center, it will turn back off via the schedule.   I.e. If started manually the next scheduled stop time will turn it off.
