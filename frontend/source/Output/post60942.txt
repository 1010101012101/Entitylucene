Why do Twitter notifications in Notification Center open in Safari? <body> Is it possible to load Twitter.app instead of opening Safari when clicking Twitter notifications in the Notification Center?  The current behaviour really annoys me because it keeps making me sign in and I don't want it to remember my credentials.  <answer60950> Indeed, the Twitter notifications will always redirect you to the web application, even if you have a native Twitter client installed. In fact, Twitter notifications also work without Twitter.app as long as you have your Twitter account configured.  There currently is no way to change this behaviour.  <answer119523> If you use Choosy, you can redirect twitter.com links from anywhere to the official Twitter app (which Choosy recognizes as a browser). It won't open the specific tweet you've clicked on, but it will at least open the client.  <comment316461> DAMN that is annoying!
