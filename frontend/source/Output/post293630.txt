Showing two mouse cursors? <body> Whats up with this?:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Td8v4.jpg" alt="enter image description here"   When I have a mouse cursor size that is bigger than the actual mouse, this shows up. Please help! It is really annoying and it makes my computer lag. It does not survive a reboot, but right when someone else logs into my computer or I log out and then log back in, it starts again.  <answer296131> strongOne issue could possibly be with the Shake mouse pointer to locate./strong  strongTo turn it off:/strong  Go into System Preferences - Accessibility - Display.  Uncheck the option: Shake mouse pointer to locate.  This might fix it but I'm not sure.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3qExZ.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer296159> Ahh, this is just because you have "Shake mouse pointer to locate" turned on. This is a useful feature but if you have a computer that goes into a limbo a lot it will freeze up like this. The smaller cursor is the one that is being used.   System Preferences  Accessibility  Display  Uncheck "Shake Mouse Pointer to Locate" - the large cursor should disappear, but if that doesn't work, make sure the setting is changed, then restart your computer.   Hopefully this helps!  <comment370590> what do you want help with?  A large cursor or two cursors. Since the 2 cursors are aligned, why is it such a problem?  It's like having a different image for the cursor. Just curious. <comment370636> @john That is the problem, it is not just a picture, it lags behind the big cursor, it does not disappear when I am watching videos (which is confusing to some streaming networks), and it lags my computer. <comment371062> How are you setting the larger cursor, using Mac OS X internal support or using a 3rd party app? What OS version? <comment373987> @Josh I set it to a larger cursor in settings <comment374019> It did not work.I tried it <comment374021> Do you by chance have a secondary monitor hooked up as well? <comment374044> How is your answer any different then the other answer posted 8 hours before yours, that also has a comment from the OP stating "It did not work.I tried it"? <comment374049> Does this 'feature' survive a reboot? <comment374050> Can you create a new user (or Guest user) and tell us if your problem persists? <comment374140> This is the same answer as the other guy's! I am marking this as wrong as well... <comment374162> @norcaljohnny No, I do not. I do not even have one close by that I can hook up <comment374163> @CousinCocaine Yeah, I tried that! It doesn't work! Let me update my question
