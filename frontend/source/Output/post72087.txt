XQuartz disk image won't open <body> Every time I try to open the .dmg to install XQuartz, a window pops up saying codethe following disk images couldn't be opened/code and the reason shown is codenot recognized/code. I don't know if I need another application to open it or if the file is corrupted, or if it's some other problem entirely.  <answer72089> I'd say the file downloaded is corrupted, you should be able to open the .dmg by simply double clicking it (I downloaded XQuartz a couple of days ago and could open the .dmg without a problem).  Unfortunately, the download page doesn't provide a checksum to check against, so I'll provide the one I generated:     98b2ca8580046d5b91250c5a244c8182437dc9d7   strongThis checksum uniquely identifies the XQuarz .dmg./strong  You can generate a checksum of XQuartz on your Mac like this (from http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1652):  ol liOpen Terminal (in code/Application/Utilities/code)/li liType:  codeopenssl sha1 ~/Downloads/XQuartz-2.7.4.dmg/code   (adapt to the path where codeXQuartz-2.7.4.dmg/code was downloaded)/li liCompare the number you get with the number above. If they are different, the file is corrupted./li /ol  <comment83696> Are you on Mountain Lion?  is gatekeeper on? <comment129711> [What do I do if the disk image data is corrupted?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/110026/8546)Â (2013-11-10)
