How do I run a cron job on a Mac? <body> How can I make my Mac (running the most recent OS) do a task automatically once a day? For example, I'd like to have it automatically download a copy of this open source algebraic geometry textbook once a day. I have a feeling that some combination of wget and cron should work, but, after googling and reading the cron documentation, I just couldn't get it to work right.  <answer9374> I think in OS X you should use codelaunchctl/code for "cron jobs".br But otherwise your task should be easy to do with a cronjobbr codesudo crontab -ebr 55 23 * * * wget http://www.math.columbia.edu/algebraic_geometry/stacks-git/book.pdf/code    This should run everyday at 23:55  strongUpdate/strong  You should specify the output location of WGET with code-O /path/to/file/code  <answer9391> If you're finding the command line syntax (etc) too confusing/arcane, you might lok at GUI tool for viewing/editing/creating these jobs.   In the past I've used Lingon, which has been made available on the Mac App Store now too. I don't need to use it very often, but it's very useful when I do!  <answer9392> You may use Cronnix which is a free graphical interface for cron :  http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/7486/cronnix/  <answer9399> The cron daemon can be activated by a simple:  precodesudo touch /private/etc/crontab /code/pre  Then it's advisable to enter the full path of your /usr/local/bin/wget (or wherever it lives). Cron does not know of your user's $PATH. Hope it helps.  <answer9402> A more elegant solution (than cron) is to use iCal notifications + Applescript.  First, launch AppleScript Editor (located under /Application/Utilities) and paste the following code:  precodeset the destination_file to ("~/Downloads/book.pdf")  set the contentLink to "http://www.math.columbia.edu/algebraic_geometry/stacks-git/book.pdf"  tell application "URL Access Scripting"     download contentLink to destination_file replacing yes end tell /code/pre  Save the script and quit applescript editor.  Open your iCal and create a new event for today, setting the time you want, select "repeat: Every day" and as an alarm "Run script" and select your applescript.   If you want to notified for every download, you may add another alarm with a "Message with Sound", "on date".  <answer71711> I recommend Macaroni. Its advantage is that when you set a job to run once a day, it runs whenever your computer is on, regardless of the time. So you won't miss a job because the computer was off at the specified time.     Macaroni is a tool which handles regular maintenance for Mac OS X, including the Mac OS X repair privileges process as well as Unix-style maintenance. You could do this yourself, but don't you have more interesting things to do with your time?   <comment9888> If using launchd, see http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3030/how-to-run-something-automatically-when-the-system-boots-or-a-use-logs-on <comment9906> I suggest you don't use Crontab and instead learn to use Launchd as already suggested. <comment40645> You don't necessarily need sudo. Individual users can have their own crontabs
