Failed AppStore download <body> I have tried to download an update from the AppStore for Yosemite 10.10.4 and unfortunately it interrupted.  Now I am in a situation where if I try the update again I get the following message:  codeSome updates need to finish downloading before they are installed./code  If I confirm with codeDownload &amp; Restart/code it will tell me it is rebooting the computer but then  et another message saying:  codeAvailable updates have changed/code  If I confirm that one too it will just go back to the previous message.  It is some sort of infinite loop.  I have tried updating through the Terminal with:  codesoftwareupdate/code command but the result is the same.  <answer194431> Check your versions of Pages, Numbers &amp; Keynote &amp; make sure they're not updating in the background [look at Launchpad for the telltale thermometer] - mine updated to x.5.3 when I first tried updating to 10.10.4 &amp; I had to wait until they were finished before the OS update would run.
