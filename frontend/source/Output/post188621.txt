How do I assign / unassign tags to Evernote notes using Javascript for Automation? <body> I'm creating a Script for turning Evernote Notes into Omnifocus-Items, using Javascript for Automation. Currently, the script searches for items with a certain tag, which works great. Now, I want to unassign this tag or assign a different tag to ensure no Note gets added twice.  Looking into the Evernote Javascript for Automation Function Library in the Script Editor, I found the methods assign / unassign, which should do what I want - but I'm unable to use them.  This is a shortened version of my code:  precodeEvernote = Application('Evernote'); var notes = Evernote.findNotes("tag:omni");  for(i = 0, len = notes.length; i &lt; len; i++){     var note = notes[i];     // Add Tag inOmni     var tag = Evernote.Tag({name:'inOmni'});     Evernote.assign(tag, {to: note}); } /code/pre  This gives me the ultra-useful error message codeError 0: No error./code I tried codevar tag = Evernote.Tag({name:'inOmni'}).make();/code (using make()), which results in the script editor reminding me the tag "inOmni" already exists.  It seems like I need to get the actual Tag-Object for 'inOmni', but how can I do this?  Also, is there any documentation or sample code for Evernote JavaScript Automation?
