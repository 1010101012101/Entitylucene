Alternative to iTunes Album Art <body> I'm looking for an alternative to iTunes' Album Art. I liked it so far but since the upgrade to Lion / latest iTunes I see some annoying bugs.  To be worth considering, the alternative I'm looking for emmust have/em at least these three features:  ul liAutomatic lyrics download and saving in the ID3 tag;/li liAutomatic cover download (iTunes is confused when the album title is missing);/li liDisplay cover/title/artist on the desktop./li /ul  Any suggestions?  <answer39839> Have you tried Corripio Artwork Finder or Album Art Thingy ?  They do cover art and lyrics.  <answer39840> For the lyrics part, I would recommend Get Lyrical. It can actively tag songs, tag specific songs, or tag a playlist. It gets all of its lyrics from Lyrics Wiki. This is a great little application and I highly recommend it. It has a simple, clean interface that is really easy to use:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/r9IaM.png" alt="Get Lyrical"  <answer90130> There is www.itunescovers.com, export your iTunes library as XML file and upload it there, they find almost every CD cover available!  <answer90135> strongTagalicious/strong is a paid for app that:  ul liWorks seeminglessly with iTunes./li liFinds Album Art &amp; Song Lyrics/li liOrganises your music with the right information &amp; tags/li /ul  It maybe expensive, but it may also be worth it where other apps have let you down in the past.

You dug up the topic for that?
