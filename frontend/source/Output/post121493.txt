Tiger to Mavericks? <body> I'm running Mac OS X 10.4.11 on a 2007 MacBook. I want to upgrade to Mavericks, but I can't do so without using the Mac App Store to download the upgrade. Tiger doesn't have the Mac App Store. How can I get around this?  <answer121494> As you can see here, your MacBook is too old and is not compatible with Mavericks nor with Mountain Lion.   <answer121523> Mavericks is a free upgrade only if you already have 10.6 or higher.  If you have 10.4 or 10.5, you need to at least purchase the 10.6 upgrade for $19.99 from the Apple Store.  Installing 10.6 will give you the App Store and the ability to upgrade to Mavericks for free assuming your hardware will run Mavericks.  Snow Leopard (US Apple Store)  <comment141626> According to both that link and Apple's website, my computer is compatible with Mavericks. <comment141627> That really doesn't relate to me as I'm working with Apple engineering and should probably just call them. <comment141628> Is it a Macbook Pro or a MacBook ? Because only the Pro 2007 are indeed compatible. (Even if for performance sake I would not update)
