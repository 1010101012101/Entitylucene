Remove disk image from the disk list <body> In Disk Utility I see two disk images (Flash Updates)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VRl1D.png" alt="enter image description here"  But I cannot find where the image file could be.  On the console with codediskutil/code I see  precode/dev/disk2 (disk image):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:     Apple_partition_scheme                        +16.9 MB    disk2    1:        Apple_partition_map                         32.3 KB    disk2s1    2:                  Apple_HFS Flash Player            16.9 MB    disk2s2 /dev/disk4 (disk image):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:     Apple_partition_scheme                        +17.2 MB    disk4    1:        Apple_partition_map                         32.3 KB    disk4s1    2:                  Apple_HFS Flash Player            17.1 MB    disk4s2 /code/pre  And with codediskutil info/code  precode   Device Identifier:        disk4    Device Node:              /dev/disk4    Whole:                    Yes    Part of Whole:            disk4    Device / Media Name:      Apple UDIF read-only compressed (bzip2) Media     Volume Name:              Not applicable (no file system)     Mounted:                  Not applicable (no file system)     File System:              None     Content (IOContent):      Apple_partition_scheme    OS Can Be Installed:      No    Media Type:               Generic    Protocol:                 Disk Image    SMART Status:             Not Supported     Total Size:               17.2 MB (17170432 Bytes) (exactly 33536 512-Byte-Units)    Volume Free Space:        Not applicable (no file system)    Device Block Size:        512 Bytes     Read-Only Media:          Yes    Read-Only Volume:         Not applicable (no file system)     Device Location:          External    Removable Media:          Yes    Media Removal:            Software-Activated     Virtual:                  Yes    OS 9 Drivers:             No    Low Level Format:         Not supported /code/pre  Is there a way to know where these images are on my disk?  <answer215522> codehdiutil/code will show information about all mounted DMGs:  precodehwd@hwds-iMac:~$ hdiutil info   framework       : 415 driver          : 10.11v415 ================================================ image-path      : /Users/hwd/Downloads/mountedImageOne.dmg image-alias     : /Users/hwd/Downloads/mountedImageOne.dmg shadow-path     : &lt;none&gt; icon-path       : /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/DiskImages.framework    /Resources/CDiskImage.icns image-type      : UDIF, nur Lesen, komprimiert (bzip2) system-image    : false blockcount      : 22528 blocksize       : 512 writeable       : false autodiskmount   : TRUE removable       : TRUE image-encrypted : false mounting user   : hwd mounting mode   : &lt;unknown&gt; process ID      : 5376 /dev/disk2      Apple_partition_scheme   /dev/disk2s1    Apple_partition_map  /dev/disk2s2    Apple_HFS   /Volumes/mountedImageOne ================================================ image-path      : /Users/hwd/Downloads/mountedImageTwo.dmg image-alias     : /Users/hwd/Downloads/mountedImageTwo.dmg shadow-path     : &lt;none&gt; icon-path       : /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/DiskImages.framework/Resources/CDiskImage.icns image-type      : UDIF, nur Lesen, komprimiert (zlib) system-image    : false blockcount      : 20480 blocksize       : 512 writeable       : false autodiskmount   : TRUE removable       : TRUE image-encrypted : false mounting user   : hwd mounting mode   : &lt;unknown&gt; process ID      : 5416 /dev/disk3      GUID_partition_scheme    /dev/disk3s1    48465300-0000-AAAA-AAAA-000000000000    /Volumes/mountedImageTwo /code/pre  <answer227311> Mount them through Disk Utility and you will see them in Finder where you can just unmount them by clicking on the eject icon in the sidebar next to their names (in Finder) and they will disappear.  <answer230725> The question is actually "How to remove...".  It can be ejected by using the device path  codediskutil eject /dev/disk4/code  Substitute codedisk4/code for whichever disk is offensive.  <comment260306> Does clicking on the actual disk image (Apple UDIF...) show where it's at? On the old disk utility, it would be there. <comment276087> Thanks for the answer! But it doesn't actually answer the question that was asked. <comment287111> The eject command works. I had 2 of these relics for some time. <comment287112> Hi, the question is not on how to eject them but where the dmg files are on the disk. <comment287145> Try selecting the disk image icon rather than the unmounted volume icon (which is what the image above shows). At least in previous versions of Disk Utility, that shows info about the disk image file (.dmg). You can also right click on the disk image icon and choose Eject. Not sure if that still holds true for El Capitan or not... <comment367254> Thanks John2095 that worked for me on my MacBookPro running El Capitan. Just encase people have not done this before this what to do - open the Macintosh HD/Applications/Utilities/TERMINAL.APP - then just type diskutil eject /devdisk2 substitute disk2 for whichever disk you want to eject like John2095 said.
