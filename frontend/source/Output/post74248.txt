Mountain Lion - scale down the window shadows <body> it is just me or did apple increased the size of the window shadows in mountain lion way to much? This is annoying when you've 2 windows side by side - is there any way to turn them off / to scale them down?  <answer104465> The program I use to do this on OS X 10.8.4 is ShadowSweeper.  http://download.cnet.com/ShadowSweeper/3000-2072_4-75966596.html  This one looks like it might also work but I haven't tried it myself.  https://github.com/puffnfresh/toggle-osx-shadows  Others have suggested the programs ShadowKiller and Nocturne. Neither worked for me.  <comment86270> Related questions: [61924](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/61924/how-can-i-remove-the-window-shadow-in-mountain-lion), [126374](http://superuser.com/questions/126374/how-do-i-decrease-the-window-shadow-in-mac-os-x), [256707](http://superuser.com/questions/256707/disable-drop-shadows-around-windows-or-the-menu-bar-on-os-x)
