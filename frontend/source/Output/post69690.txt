echo $PATH giving different result to what .bash_profile states <body> I'm trying to install Homebrew (to then install RVM, then Octopress).  Homebrew is installed but when I run codebrew doctor/code I get the message:  codeConsider amending your PATH so that /usr/local/bin occurs before /usr/bin in your PATH./code  I have changed my code~/.bash_profile/code to codeexport PATH="/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:~/bin:$PATH"/code.  code~/.bashrc/code is empty.  codeetc/paths/code has   precode/usr/local/bin /usr/local/sbin /usr/bin /bin /usr/sbin /sbin /code/pre  codeecho $PATH/code states  code/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/git/bin:/Users/deadlyhifi/.rvm/bin/code  I tried installing RVM previously but had all kinds of problems with the compiler not being correct since I have Xcode 4.5.1 installed - I uninstalled RVM and am now trying again. My $PATH has reference to the RVM but I can't for the life in me find the file that contains that path.  Can anyone shed any light on the subject?  Edit:  The codeetc/profile/code contains:  precode# System-wide .profile for sh(1)  if [ -x /usr/libexec/path_helper ]; then eval `/usr/libexec/path_helper -s` fi  if [ "${BASH-no}" != "no" ]; then [ -r /etc/bashrc ] &amp;&amp; . /etc/bashrc fi /code/pre  <comment80942> Can you please copy and past your entire `~/.bash_profile` and `~/.profile`. Also, I assume that the paths in `\etc\paths` are not on the same line, right? <comment80947> I've added the profile data, and etc/paths are on separate lines. <comment80949> Please copy and paste also ~/.profile if exist <comment80952> I've figured it out. I've got [Oh My ZSH](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) installed. That's created `~/.zshrc`. This is where the $PATH is defined. I've edited that and now my system is raring to brew. I'd have never found that if I wasn't searching through all the `.files`.
