Adding a "Fax Number" when adding a new contact in my iPhone 5, ios6 <body> When adding a new contact, I"m confused when I get to the "phone contact numbers".  I only see strongMobile/strong and strongHome/strong.  I want to add a fax number, but it isn't available and it isn't offered in emAdd another field/em.  <answer119893> On your contact, click on the label type :   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/egGX2.png" alt="enter image description here"  And it will give you access to the label types.   These are iOS 7 screens, but it's the same on older versions !
