AppleScript to find and delete a folder inside an FCPX library <body> I need to write or find a simple script to find, select and move to trash, folders within a Final Cut Pro X library. Because these libraries are bundles you can't search them in the normal way.  What I want is a script that runs every day, searches the libraries finds Folders (and their contents) called "Render Files" and then moves them to trash.  I can use automator to find the bundles, and to list the contents, but then I cannot get it to select only the 'Render Files' folders.  <answer135274> Add the following to your crontab (codeenv EDITOR=nano crontab -e/code):  precode@daily /usr/bin/find /path/to/fcplibraries -name "Render Files" -type d -delete /code/pre  supKeep backups and make sure you've got the right path./sup  <comment160332> Any particular reason why you need AppleScript? I've added an answer that doesn't use AppleScript <comment160413> Thanks George  I thought cron was deprecated in mac mavericks. I came up with this rm -R /Volumes/Home/RBPY/Final\ Cut\ Libraries/*.fcpbundle/*/Render\ Files which works but still not sure what to do to save it correctly and run it automatically at a set time. <comment160810> @Doug Run `env EDITOR=nano crontab -e`, add a new line beginning with `@daily` then your command, then save.
