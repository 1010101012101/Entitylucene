How to turn 3G off on iPhone 5 running iOS8? <body> After the update to iOS8, the switch to disable the 3G has been replaced by a disable 4G switch.  4G is already off but how could I also disable also 3G (which is still active, as shown on the status bar)  <answer154160> You can only really turn off "all" mobile data, so there's no falling back on good old GPRS...  If you go to:  precodeSettings -&gt; Mobile -&gt; Mobile Data (and 4G if you want that off too). /code/pre  "Mobile Data" is the old "3G" switch, I guess. I suppose apple assume that the entire world is 3G ready xD  It will disable all data via mobile (not wifi etc..)...  <answer192398> Settings-Cellular-Voice&amp;Data: choose 2G  <comment181427> Apple does not assume. It's handled by the carriers. <comment181428> possible duplicate of [How to select 2G as data network on iOS 8?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/152419/how-to-select-2g-as-data-network-on-ios-8) <comment181431> I meant apple in general :).. pedantics though.. <comment181440> Just to clarify. What I meant is that the newer versions of IOS don't make any utterance of GPRS any more. It's ac case go 3G or no mobile internet :D <comment228833> Since the full switching was re-introduced in [I think] iOS 8.3, yes. <comment228834> My phone will auto-drop to GPRS, or Edge, if I can't get 3G or 4G. Worst cases it shows no 'type' at all.
