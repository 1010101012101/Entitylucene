How do I prevent the permissions denied message from being displayed when I do a find command? <body> I'm trying to run a find command, aka:  precodefind / -name "some_file" -print  /code/pre  and my results are full of permission denied messages:  precodefind: /.DocumentRevisions-V100: Permission denied /code/pre  How do I prevent them from showing up in my search results?  <answer92642> Three ways come to mind:  ul lirun the command as administrator: codesudo find / -name "whatever" -print/code/li lidiscard all error output: codefind / -name "whatever" -print 2&gt;/dev/null/code/li lifilter "Permission denied" messages: codefind / -name "whatever" -print 2&gt;&amp;1 | fgrep -v "Permission denied"/code/li /ul  The key difference between the second and third option is probably that the second discards emall/em error messages while the third will not show any files/folders where the name contains "Permission denied" (which is probably highly unlikely).  In addition it may be also worth noting that you shouldn't use the third option if you plan to further process the output of codefind/code via a pipe. The reason here is that standard and error output are sent via two different channels (and only visually combined afterwards by the shell). If you pipe the output into another command only the content of standard output will be inputed into the next command.  <comment108774> Great answer patrix! I would have only given `2/dev/null` myself, +1 for being so thorough!
