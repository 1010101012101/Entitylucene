Any Keychain Access.app documentation? <body> Is there any documentation about the capabilities of the Keychain Access application included with OS X 10.9?  <answer112010> How about WikiPedia? Article is pretty good.  The help many has documentation, which also is published on the web by Apple. Lastly, you can search http://apple.com/support for keychain and get several articles that document the basics and troubleshooting for Keychain Access.
