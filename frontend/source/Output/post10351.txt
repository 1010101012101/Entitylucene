iPhone: WiFi, Bluetooth and cellular network not working <body> I have iPhone 3GS and suddenly it's gone away. I mean WiFi, bluetooth is not working, and I can't make any calls.  Here's a screenshot:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lfvTO.png" alt="No wifi, no BT, no network"  Any help will be appreciated!  <answer10419> Wow. Seems like the modem/baseband part is gone wrong. Try rebooting the phone. If still not working - backup your information (from iTunes) and try a restore to factory settings (I'm assuming a factory unlocked phone, no JB). If this doesn't help - probably it's a hardware failure.  About the IMEI blockage - no, it's not the case.  <comment10896> I would **guess** this has been IMEI blocked through the carrier. <comment12762> Yeah, I have seen a firmware update go wrong and do this, and the actual hardware go wrong and do this, :(
