Connect to wireless network from command line <body> When I enable the personal hotspot on my iPhone, a network appears called codeGreg's iPhone/code. I can navigate to it in the WiFi network selector thing.   It's a bit annoying to navigate to my phone when there are many networks available. Also, sometimes the network doesn't show up when my phone is in range until I disable and re-enable the wireless network. I'm also a bit concerned that the name codeGreg's iPhone/code isn't terribly unique.  Is there some kind of UUID that uniquely identifies my phone and its personal hotspot? Is there a way of using that id in a shell script or applescript script to attempt to connect to my iPhone's personal hotspot and fail if it isn't available?
