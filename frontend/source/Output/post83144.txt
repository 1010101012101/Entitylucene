Backing up individual files with encryption <body> In addition to local Time Machine backups, I would like to automatically backup my working data  from my Macbook to a remote FTP space. Because it's  a location I don't control and sensitive data, I want to use encryption.  There are some approaches floating around the 'net how to achieve this, for example this tutorial that uses codeduplicity/code and works great (I've tested it).  However, all these approaches generate file archives of some sort (codetar/codes in the latter example). I would like to have a  backup where I can access strongevery file individually, but encrypted./strong So the backup structure would look something like this:   precode Work   Documents      Letter to Mr.T.doc.encrypted      Expenses.txt.encrypted   Images      Sunshine.jpg.encrypted    /code/pre  does anybody know a tool that can achieve this?  Alternatively, is there a stand-alone OS X command that can encrypt files? I might be able to use that in combination with codersync/code to build this on my own.  <answer83178> This question is a subset of: Tools to compress and encrypt files  See answer here:  https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/32732/43002 for built-in command line utilities which (with some scripting) will do what you want. (Such as codezip -P/code and codeopen-ssl/code)  <comment96700> These don't directly solve the issue as you'd like, but here are the methods I've used: #1 - Create an encrypted disc image. Mount it and drop the files you'd like to backup into it. Have some utility to sync this remotely (I use SugarSync). #2 - Use CrashPlan [free year membership here] (https://www.crashplan.com/carboniteswitcher/) to backup to their encrypted cloud. In CrashPlan settings you can create a custom 448-bit encryption key to encrypt the backup.
