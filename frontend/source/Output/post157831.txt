How do you import a specific song in to iTunes? <body> How do I import a specific song, not already in my iTunes library, in to iTunes?  <answer157837> iTunes Preferences - Advanced, uncheck "Copy files to iTunes Media folder when adding to Library". Drag the media file you want to add into the iTunes window, or use the "Library - Add to Library" option in the File menu.  <comment185617> to clarify - iTunes will always add to the Library, but won't necessarily add a copy of the file to the default Library location. <comment185625> Just double click o it or in iTunes do File-Add to Library
