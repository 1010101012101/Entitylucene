How can I get Safari AutoFill to include formatting in phone numbers? <body> When I use Safari's AutoFill to enter phone numbers on websites, it seems to always remove formatting characters from the phone number as shown in the drop-down. As an example, if I'm entering my phone number on a LinkedIn message, the drop-down will show a correctly-formatted number from my contact list as follows:     (123) 456-7890 - main   but the number actually entered into the field will have formatting removed, e.g. code1234567890/code. This isn't a limitation of the forms, as I can type directly into the field and have the number show up correctly.  How can I get AutoFill to enter the phone number properly-formatted?
