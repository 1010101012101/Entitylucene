How to prevent 'sudo rm -rf /' <body> A few times I have accidentally executed the command codesudo rm -rf //code.  Is there a way how to prevent me from running this command? For example can I somehow disable it using the sudoers file?  <answer191684> You can add a line like  precode%admin ALL = !/bin/rm -rf / /code/pre  to your codesudoers/code file to prevent the execution of the command with the specific options.  Or, if you want to exclude several commands, you can work with command aliases  precodeCmnd_Alias DANGEROUS_CMNDS=/bin/rm -rf /, /bin/rm -fr / %admin ALL=!DANGEROUS_CMNDS /code/pre  You can also try to play it safe by using  precodeCmnd_Alias DANGEROUS_CMNDS=/bin/rm -rf /, /bin/rm -fr /, /bin/rm / *, /bin/rm * /, /bin/rm -rf / *, /bin/rm -rf * /, /bin/rm -fr / *, /bin/rm -fr* / %admin ALL=!DANGEROUS_CMNDS /code/pre  but there still might be other ways you can shoot yourself in the foot with coderm/code so embe careful/em anyway.  But keep in mind that all matching is done on the full string of the command, so codesudo rm -rf /Volumes/code would still work (as would codecd /; sudo rm -rf ./code).  PS: By all means, use codesudo visudo/code to edit the codesudoers/code file and strongNEVER/strong edit it directly  PPS: I obviously didn't test this with coderm/code (only with code/bin/echo/code instead)  <answer191878> I know you phrased the question in a way that makes me suspect you don't want to hear this answer, but you really should remove yourself from the sudoers file if you're prone to making the same mistake over and over.  The underlying problem is you haven't aliased coderm/code to be move to trash (which is clearly how you are using it currently and in the past) or otherwise forced coderm -r/code to be forced into coderm -ri/code  precodealias rm='/bin/rm -i' /code/pre  You can always get around the alias with codecommand rm -rf whatever/code once you've trained your mind on when measure twice, cut once is needed for coderm -rf/code use.  <comment228035> Comments are not for extended discussion; this conversation has been [moved to chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/24887/discussion-on-answer-by-patrix-how-to-prevent-sudo-rm-rf). <comment228136> Thanks for that tip. I was thinking on making am hidden admin account (to access terminal only) and a standard account for normal use only. I could make the wrapper to move to the trash instead too. Thanks for that tip. I think that preventing sudo may be a safer step. I will still make sure I can access it by logging into the hidden admin. <comment228137> Haven't marked is a s answered though since it doesn't answer the above. This is still good advice though <comment228533> How do you accidentally type this command and then execute it?? <comment228593> If I type in a command like this. `sudo rm -rf / Applications/chess.app` Notice the space between the / and the A. That's how
