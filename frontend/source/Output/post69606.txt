My iPhone 4 contacts just say 'share contact' instead of showing the number <body> I live in the UK.  When I try to see my contacts details the screen just says 'share contact' instead of letting me see any phone numbers. This also happens if I try to store a new number, so I am having to put phone numbers in manually to call people.  If someone texts me, it is just their number that is showing not their names and if I try to text I can not access people by name; it is as if there is a block to the numbers.  Can anyone help please? I have read various forums and tried to reset my settings to no avail. I have also restored my iPhone with no luck! and tried to sync the phone to itunes several times.
