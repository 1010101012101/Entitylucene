Why is Time Machine not saving Google Chrome History file? <body> I need to restore Google Chrome (Canary) browsing history from a Time Machine backup. It seems Time Machine has backed up all the profile files in code~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/code emexcept/em the codeHistory/code file. Oops. Why is that, and how can I restore Chrome's History from a backup?  <answer280891> strongWhy Chrome history is not backed up/strong  You are correct that the code~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/code location you reference strongis/strong where Google Chrome's history (among other things) is stored.  However, (and I don't recall exactly where I originally came across this), that App developers can determine which files (if any) they want skipped by a Time Machine backup strongand/strong that Goggle doesn't allow Chrome's History to be backed up by Time Machine.  Although I only use Google Chrome occasionally, I personally get around this limitation by strongmanually backing up/strong the five files not backed up via Time Machine. The five files in question are:  ul liFavicons/li liFavicons-journal/li liHistory/li liHistory-journal/li lipreviews_opt_out.db-journal/li /ul  strongRestoring your missing Chrome history/strong  Now, in terms of restoring your currently missing history, you emmay/em have some luck if you have a Google Account. If so, you could check whether you had Chrome Sync enabled. If you did, Chrome Sync syncs your history (as well as bookmarks, passwords, etc) to your Google Account so you can use them on other devices.  <comment354749> Thanks--further research shows the chromium team decided to mark the History database as not backed up, in order to keep the backups from growing larger with the ever-changing History file. Terrible design decision--they should just split and rotate the History so that only the most recent portion is backed up often. Sure, if you are willing to upload your entire browsing history, etc. to Google then no problem. In this case, it was kept locally and needed to be restored for forensic purposes, but SOL. Oops.
