How to search installed apps <body> Do a one finger downward stroke to bring up the search menu.  Type an app name "twitter".  I expect to see the installed application "twitter" because this is the behavior that occurred in iOS 8.  Instead, I see podcasts, mail, messages, notes, websites and bing searches.   I have to manually click through my 100+ installed apps to open them or ask siri to do it.  This behavior began immediately after upgrading to iOS 9.0.  How do I enable search for installed apps in ios 9?  <answer210868> Spotlight can be slow and only returns partial results in some cases.  Solutions include:  ol liExamining free space on the phone and deleting things so that there is about 1 GB of usable storage space./li liPower down the iPhone and start it back up.
