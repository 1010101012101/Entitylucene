Symbolic links, why doesn't this work: <body> precodeme$ ln -s ~/x/y/ ~/Desktop/ ln: /Users/me/Desktop//: File exists /code/pre  Why does this attempt at creating a symbolic link to code~/x/y/codeon the Desktop now work? The only way I can seem to get something like a symbolic link is this way:  precodeln -s * ~/Desktop/ /code/pre  I'm confused, this was really simple in Ubuntu.  <answer107148> codeln -s ~/x/y/ ~/Desktop//code attempts to symlink code~/Desktop//code to code~/x/y//code, which does not appear to be what you wanted, and is indeed not possible since code~/Desktop/code exists (as the error states).  To create a symlink to code~/x/y//code inside code~/Desktop//code, you need to give it a name like so:  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codeln -s ~/x/y/ ~/Desktop/mysymlink /code/pre  This creates a symlink codemysymlink/code on your desktop that links to code~/x/y//code.  <answer107149> Alternatively, you can do  precodeln -s ~/x/y ~/Desktop/ /code/pre  (note there's no slash '/' character after ~/x/y/).  I think the error message is not the most informative, but I understand it as that if you're putting a trailing slash, you're referring to the content of your directory (in this case ~/x/y), but if you omit it, you're referring to the directory itself.   <comment125658> Of course this one doesn't. You've done `ln -s ~/Desktop/symlink ~/Desktop/` which makes a symlink onto itself (there already is a ~/Desktop/symlink file in there, you can't link it to itself). If you do `ln -s ~/tmp/symlink ~/Desktop/` it should work. <comment125660> Hmm, now it lets me make the symlink, but the symlink shows the default file icon (instead of the folder icon) and attempting to open the symlink [shows an error](http://f.cl.ly/items/29202T0T2M1e2K3w3R0Y/Screen%20Shot%202013-10-27%20at%2020.40.22.png)â€¦ <comment125662> what type is the file that you're trying to make a link to? I've followed your initial sequence: `mkdir -p ~/x/y; ln -s ~/x/y ~/Desktop/` and all was created as expected, with a symlink Directory icon named `y` on my desktop. I can double-click that directory and it opens fine. Also, when I do `ls -la ~/Desktop/y` I get `lrwxr-xr-x  1 me  staff  15 27 Oct 20:47 /Users/me/Desktop/y@ - /Users/me/x/y` in response. Can you show exactly the steps you've taken (ideally a full text capture of your terminal window)? <comment125663> Nevermind, it does work! Thanks a lot. :) <comment125664> Again, can you paste in the commands and their output exactly as you've typed them? Difficult to tell without seeing them. <comment125665> [Here's my Terminal output.](http://cl.ly/SAr6) Getting the same error as @Tor when attempting to open symlink. <comment125666> Hmm... I'll be honest with you. I've done the exact same thing on my system (OSX 10.9) and it works perfectly... beats me! <comment125667> Yeah, for me the problem was with an empty folder. But the folder with content worked fine. The latter is my "use case" so it's fine.
