Change a Mac Mission Control wallpaper using the terminal <body> I can use Automater to change the wallpaper of the current "space" im in, but I can't tell it to change another space.  Any thoughts?  <answer43660> This isn't automator, but works well for me.  In the space that you want to change the desktop, open strongSystem Preferences/strong  strongDesktop &amp; Screen Saver/strong  Select the picture you want for that space/screen.   <comment49589> Note to self: try Built in Desktop pic folder option in pref. <comment49835> mmm, yeah wont work for me. I'm after a "live" type wallpaper which auto updates everytime a new image appears in a folder.
