Restrict sftp user to a single directory in El Capitan <body> Searched the web for quite some time and still can't find a solution.  Is it even possible at all to restrict ssh user to a single directory in 10.11? I have set up an user account via System Preferences Users &amp; Groups. Under Advanced Options I specified a home directory. This is the highest level directory he can go.  Followed some instruction to modify ssh/sshd_config to include:  precodeMatch User ftpuser   ChrootDirectory &lt;the directory path&gt;   PermitTunnel no   AllowAgentForwarding no   AllowTcpForwarding no   X11Forwarding no /code/pre  but it doesn't work.  <answer223724> You need to make sure that the code&lt;the directory path&gt;/code fulfils the next requirement specified in the manual pages for codesshd_config(8)/code:     All components of the pathname must be root-owned directories that are not writable by any other user or group.   If you don't, then     it doesn't work.   But you are certainly notified about the problem in system log.  <comment286297> What is wrong with my answer?
