Can you please revise your question to actually focus on the problem you are trying to solve, wait for it to get reopened and than add the answer below? <comment235588> Apple's Java is old and predates Retina and they have not added it would seem to be the obvious answer <comment235604> Yes but with Apple Java SE 6 older version works well and in newer Oracle Java SE 7 is not. Additional feedback is welcome.
