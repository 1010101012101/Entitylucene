what is the app for seeing text being typed on a messenger <body> i know of a app which pops up a dialog at the top right corner of the screen, when a user in on skype and the other person is typing something.  this is not specific to skype, but for any messenger that is installed on the mac.  i know that the name of the app starts with c but i am not sure if the name is crawl or cawl or something else....  i would really appreciate if someone can help me.  thank you in advance.  <answer15101> strongGrowl/strong?
