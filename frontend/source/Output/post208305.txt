Recovery HD doesn't boot <body> I just upgraded to El Cap, and now recovery HD will not boot. It goes part of the way, but gets stuck here:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OGPEl.jpg" alt=""  I've tried to boot multiple times, but it just gets stuck there.  Resetting the NVRAM appears to work. However, I used the terminal command: codesudo nvram -c/code, instead of the startup key combination.  <answer208504> Just got it fixed by the help of Apple Support following this Apple support page: How to Reset NVRAM on your Mac     Resetting NVRAM      ol   liShut down your Mac./li   liLocate the following keys on the keyboard: Command (âŒ˜), Option, P, and R. /li   liTurn on your Mac./li   liPress and hold the Command-Option-P-R keys immediately after you hear the startup sound./li   liHold these keys until the computer restarts and you hear the startup sound for a second time./li   liRelease the keys./li   /ol      After resetting NVRAM, you may need to reconfigure settings for   speaker volume, screen resolution, startup disk selection, and time   zone information.   <comment252456> Could you explain a bit more what you need to do? Several people have made simple answers, but it's not clear if you are looking to "remake" the Recovery HD, work an alternate way to change SIP, or what "success" looks like. Worst case, choose an Apple Support article you are following and explain what step fails you or what you're not achieving... <comment252482> @bmike this question has already been answered.
