don't need iCloud storage any longer <body> I have a phone now that has more storage, how do I remove what I have stored in iCloud storage?  I don't need to continue paying monthly  <answer285317> If you want to remove all photos, documents, data or disable iCloud library for your account.  Proceed like follow:  On iOS10: Go to strongSettings  [your_name]  iCloud  Storage  Manage Storage/strong from there you can disable, delete everything you want.   For iCloud Photo library, you'll have 30 days to download everything stored there.   Update: To download your photos and videos on your iOS device, go to strongSettings  [your name]  iCloud  Photos/strong and select strongDownload and Keep Originals./strong On your Mac, open strongPhotos,/strong choose strongPhotos  Preferences/strong, then select strongDownload Originals to this Mac/strong.  You can also select the photos and videos that you want to download from iCloud.com.  Further informations can be found here.  <comment359772> You want to 'remove' or download everything you have?  I ask because iCloud is a sync solution so whatever you delete from there will be gone for good (from every device) unless you save it somewhere. <comment359774> yes, I had 8gbs and now have 32 so I have room on this phone to put whatever I have in storage.. I can't even find how to find out what I do have storage there <comment359775> I only have like 1.5gb on storage..very little <comment359786> thank you ...but how do I download what is there back on my phone?
