Where does this symlink point to? <body> The weirdest thing.  precode$ ls -al                                        ~/vm/win_8_1.pvm/Windows Disks  total 8 drwxr-xr-x   3 zoo  staff  102 Nov 22 14:04 . drwx--x--x@ 15 zoo  staff  510 Nov 22 16:57 .. lrwxr-xr-x   1 zoo  staff   10 Nov 22 14:04 C -&gt; /Volumes/C $ readlink C                                    ~/vm/win_8_1.pvm/Windows Disks  /Volumes/C $ ls -al /Volumes                               ~/vm/win_8_1.pvm/Windows Disks  total 8 drwxrwxrwt@  3 root  admin   102 Nov 22 14:04 . drwxr-xr-x  29 root  wheel  1054 Nov  2 15:07 .. lrwxr-xr-x   1 root  admin     1 Nov 22 12:49 MacSSD -&gt; / $                                               ~/vm/win_8_1.pvm/Windows Disks /code/pre  Where the heck is code~/vm/win_8_1.pvm/Windows Disks/C/code pointing to??  <answer157738> It's pointing to the mounted system volume C (visible on the desktop see below) of your virtual Windows 8.1 machine. If you shut down the VM or disable codeShare Windows/code afterwards, the link still resides there.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/d1k1k.jpg" alt="C"  To make C visible again and your Mac secure (Windows mustn't screw the Mac volume) adjust the settings like in the picture below:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BjSwm.jpg" alt="settings"  <comment185483> I don't see it on my desktop - and why can't I find it on my file system <comment185484> comment to edit: it is not on my desktop. Double clicking the item in Finder yields "The operation can’t be completed because the original item for “C” can’t be found" <comment185485> then your vm is not running or you disabled `Windows Sharing` in the preferences afterwards <comment185487> You seem knowledgeable enough about Parallels. What I'm _trying_ to do is to do a 1-way isolation of my guest OS. i.e. I don't want Windows screwing with my filesystem on my Mac. In order to restrict the visibility of the guest OS, I was forced to enable a security isolation setting. I'm not knowledgeable about filesystems... but I _should_ still be able to view the windows files from my Mac, no? <comment185488> you may safely delete the folder `Windows Disks`and the link. <comment185489> it's safe to mount C so configure the VM Options-Sharing-Mac Sharing off & Windows Sharing On (added a picture in the answer) <comment185491> doh! this was much easier than what I did. Thanks so much for you time! Very much apprecited! <comment185492> just delete/disable any folder in `Share Mac` - `Custom Folder` (see above pic) then you may not access the Mac volume from within Windows
