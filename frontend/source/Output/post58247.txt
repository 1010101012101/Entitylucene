How do I enable PHP on Mountain Lion OS X 10.8? <body> Just upgraded to Mountain Lion, and wanted to make PHP work on the built-in version of Apache.  <answer58248> ol liEdit code/private/etc/apache2/httpd.conf/code/li liFind the line that says codeLoadModule php5_module libexec/apache2/libphp5.so/code and uncomment it by editing out the # at the beginning of the line. (Then save the file, obviously.)/li liGo to Terminal and type codesudo apachectl graceful/code at the console:/li /ol  <answer74247> Probably the easiest way is to use the PHP packages from Liip (a Swiss web development company). It's as easy as running the command from their website and you can choose among PHP 5.3, 5.4, and 5.5. For example:  precodecurl -s http://php-osx.liip.ch/install.sh | bash -s 5.4 /code/pre  That way you can also always update to the newest version (that they support), but be careful to backup your custom settings first.  I'm using this installation on Snow Leopard and it works like a charm. On my machine (not sure whether they are the same on Mountain Lion), these paths are often of interest:  ul li/usr/local/php5/lib/php.ini/li li/usr/local/php5/lib/php/PEAR//li li/usr/local/php5/php.d//li li/usr/local/php5/bin/php/li li/usr/local/php5/bin/pear/li li/usr/local/php5/bin/phpunit/li /ul  And what I did to make this up-to-date PHP version available in the command line with the command codephp/code is this:  precodesudo ln -is /usr/local/php5/bin/php /usr/bin/php /code/pre  Hope that helps.  <comment67007> The same way as in previous versions. Check http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/23751/how-to-turn-mac-os-x-lion-into-a-web-server/23757#23757 <comment86245> I highly doubt that Apple provides an up-to-date PHP version for this. <comment86249> Hey why was this downvoted? This is a perfectly sensible answer which meets the requirements of the question and, additionally, provides an up-to-date version of PHP. <comment87823> The question didn't specify an up-to-date version of PHP, and this solution hasn't been tested on Mountain Lion, which _was_ specified. So it's not very helpful. <comment88255> Actually, this solution *has* been tested on Mountain Lion as is specified in the link I posted, just the file paths *may* not be (but propably are) the same. And since when is it bad to use up-to-date software? <comment88256> The bit in your answer saying "not sure whether they are the same on Mountain Lion" suggests otherwise. <comment88265> This is just related to the paths but not the installation in general. <comment107313> Probably worth mentioning that though this answer doesn't directly apply to the original question, I still found it useful only because it showed up in Google when I was trying to find out whether PEAR and PHPUnit are supplied with the Liip installer.
