SourceTree: how to show commit information panel if once hide? <body> On one of my machines, I have somehow hidden the panel which shows commit information, such as the commit hash and the full commit message.  I'm sure it's just a setting somewhere to bring the commit panel back, but I can't find it. Can anyone help me out? Thanks!  <answer273980> Run this in the terminal &amp; restart SourceTree  precodedefaults delete com.torusknot.SourceTreeNotMAS "NSSplitView Subview Frames repowindow_LogViewDescSplitter" /code/pre  Source  <comment344414> I don't fully understand what you mean as what I suggest makes more changes than juts that tab.
