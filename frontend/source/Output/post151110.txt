Textmate OSX Yosemite ruby 1.8 <body> After upgrading to the OSX Yosemite, Textmate's duplicate line command br/ codectrl+shift D/code produces an error codewarning: -K is specified; it is for 1.8 compatibility and may cause odd behavior/code.br/ br/ Previously, this was fixed by changing the codePATH/code to code/System/Library/Frameworks/Ruby.framework/Versions/1.8/usr/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin/codebr/ br/ But now this does not work. br/ br/ How can I fix this issue?  <answer152264> You can install Ruby 1.8.7 via rbenv and add it to Textmate paths:     PATH:   /Users/YOUR_NAME/.rbenv/versions/1.8.7-p249/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin      TM_RUBY: /Users/YOUR_NAME/.rbenv/versions/1.8.7-p249/bin/ruby   If you have problems with installing ruby 1.8.7 with errors such as:     openssl_missing.h:68: error: conflicting types for 'HMAC_CTX_copy'   you can try to do strongbrew unlink openssl/strong. After successfully installing ruby you can link it back with strongbrew link openssl --force/strong  Good Luck!
