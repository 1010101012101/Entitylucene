Grayed out photos on icloud and iphone <body> I've uploaded/synched photos from my iphone5C to the cloud.  I think that all worked initially but now those same photos and videos are grayed out on both the cloud and on my iphone, both preview view and when opened up.  In the cloud, there is an "!" inside a gray triangle over the grayed out photo.  On the phone, there is a cloud symbol on the grayed out photo but it says "error downloading from the icloud".  Geotag info, dates, even time span for the videos are still there.  It's over 400 pictures so a big deal.  I originally had the free acct but upgraded to the 50gig version some time ago (part of problem?).  I've saw the similar question where they got around the problem by opening it in the editor??
