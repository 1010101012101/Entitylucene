MacBook Pro late 2016, Sierra 10.12.2: can't make VIM editor start from .merge-filetype to analyse trace files <body> I have to look on a regular base into big to huge trace files, which are plain text, but due to its sheer size would take very long to open in a simple text editor.  After I downloaded vim editor for Mac from sourceforge I executed it and put the app into the applications folder. When I opened my first .merge-file I used 'open with' and chose 'vim.app'. I got a warning that it was downloaded from internet, if I really wanted to continue. I confirmed. When I tried to run it, I got a pop-up telling me that for security reason I would not be allowed to start the program. I went to system preferences, security &amp; privacy and ticked open it anyhow and it opened. Now I wanted to open Vim-Editor when I double-clicked a .merge-file.  In the ' open with'-dialogue I marked the 'open always with', but the Vim-icon only appeared jumping in the dock for 2-3 secs and than disappears, without further notice.  Any suggestions what I can do to get it working by clicking any .merge-file.  P.S. I tried the 'Magic Launch'-application, but it did not help at all.
