How many backups does iCloud save for iPhones? <body> I've noticed that after restoring or erasing an iPhone and setting it up, you're offered backups to restore from iCloud.  How many and how old are these backups.  I couldn't find any articles explaining this. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Klwn7.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer281700> Per device, iCloud keeps the most recent backup, then 1â€“2 prior backups, regardless of age.  <comment354450> These backups seem to be for different users and phones. Which of the entries are for the same phone/AppleID? <comment354480> They're for the same Apple ID, different iPhones.
