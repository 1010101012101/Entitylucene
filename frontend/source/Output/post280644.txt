Change .jpg quality of terminal screenshots <body> I’m using a terminal script to capture my screen at set intervals. However, the resulting .jpg files are rather large. I’d like to control the quality of .jpg files being generated by this script:  precodewhile [ 1 ];do vardate=$(date +%d\-%m\-%Y\_%H.%M.%S);  screencapture -t jpg -x ~/Desktop/AutoScreenCap/$vardate.jpg;  sleep 600; done /code/pre  How can I control the .jpg quality of the resulting files?   <answer280648> Simply add the command:   precodesips -s formatOptions [low|normal|high|best|&lt;percent&gt;] ~/Desktop/AutoScreenCap/$vardate.jpg; /code/pre  after the screencapture line.  Finally it looks like this:  precodewhile :; do      vardate=$(date +%d\-%m\-%Y\_%H.%M.%S)     screencapture -t jpg -x ~/Desktop/AutoScreenCap/$vardate.jpg      sips -s formatOptions [low|normal|high|best|&lt;percent&gt;] ~/Desktop/AutoScreenCap/$vardate.jpg      sleep 600 done /code/pre  Use only one of the sips formatOptions but without square brackets. The square brackets, the single angle quotes and the vertical lines are meta instructions which mustn't be  entered literally. They mean: choose strongone/strong of the listed and  the last one is a freely selectable percentage (which should work with or without the %-symbol).  Using emlow/em will save about 55% of disk space needed, em10%/em about 65% and em1%/em about 70%. This depends on your screen content though.  <comment354085> Thanks! Now it looks like this, but I know something is wrong because it's not working:   `while [ 1 ];do vardate=$(date +%d\-%m\-%Y\_%H.%M.%S); screencapture -t jpg -x sips -s formatOptions [low] ~/Desktop/AutoScreenCap/$vardate.jpg; sleep 600; done` <comment354098> @Shawn the option must be written as `low`, without the `[]`.
