MAMP html source folder <body> Hi i'm a newbie to Apple products, I installed MAMP on my Mac and now have no idea where the default folder where all the html files are put go to. Also new to web development. Anyone help?  <answer50597> I haven't used MAMP in a while, but according to their FAQ it looks for the HTML files (by default) in: /Applications/MAMP/htdocs  This seems like an odd place to store them. You can (and probably want to) change the default in MAMP's preferences to a different folder so you can store your files somewhere else.  <answer52917> In the MAMP application, click on "Preferences..." then go on the "Apache" tab.  There you will be able to locate the default folder. You can create a new one and set it as default there too.
