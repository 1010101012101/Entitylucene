AppleScript set focus on terminal window <body> I have a AppleScript, which changes the position and the size of the application Terminal:  Like here:   precodetell application "Terminal"    set position of front window to {1, 1}    set size of front window to {1, 1} end tell /code/pre  When i'm setting the size of the window to code{1, 1}/code, it becomes really small that it's not more visible.   My question is how can i set the focus of the window for a specific time, that neither any user activity nor any application can catch the focus of the terminal window?  Best way would be with AppleScript, but any programmatically solution with python would be nice.   <answer242560> precodeactivate application "Terminal" tell application "Terminal"    set position of front window to {1, 1}    set size of front window to {1, 1} end tell tell application "System Events" to keystroke "your message here\rexit\r" /code/pre  Additionally you can get help from AppleScript get active Application  to put focus back on original application  <answer243045> With the help of javadevg and the answer of AppleScript get active Application, i created the following solution:  precodetell application "Terminal"   activate   set position of front window to {1, 1}   set size of front window to {111, 111} end tell  tell application "System Events"   set frontmostProcess to first process where it is frontmost   set visible of frontmostProcess to false   repeat while (frontmostProcess is frontmost)     delay 0.1   end repeat   set secondFrontmost to name of first process where it is frontmost   set frontmost of frontmostProcess to true end tell  tell application "System Events"   set activeApp to name of first application process whose frontmost is true   repeat while (get name of every application process) contains "Terminal"     try         activate application "Terminal"     end try   end repeat end tell /code/pre  I'm not working a lot with AppleScript, so please excuse my coding-style etc.   With this script a Terminal will open, and it doesn't loose the focus until the terminal will close.   <comment297631> Could you precise what would be a typical use case of what you are asking for? From your question it is not clear what you are trying to achieve. <comment297632> I'm developing with a Teensy board, where the Terminal will open and self-typing some commands in the terminal window. I want that NO user-action is possible during the terminal window is open, nor keyboard either mouse action. <comment298066> You could just tell the users to not to type/do anything.? <comment298223> That's not possible, every user-action should be ignored during the terminal is opened and focused. <comment298302> Is there any reason you cannot use a shell script to achieve this? It seems unnecessary to use UI scripting to run commands via terminal <comment298805> Your answer is not correct, but your hint to the question AppleScript get active Application helped me a lot! <comment298896> "Your answer is not correct," doesn't help the community. Pls share details and if you think there's better solution share that too.. <comment299035> Look at my answer
