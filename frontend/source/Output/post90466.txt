That message is telling you you have too many packages from sources. Just delete on source.  <comment106203> I'd imagine, based on the first bit, that you need to remove some of your installed packages because you have too many installed. <comment106306> @timothymh, I have deleted almost every sources. I've kept only the original one that was there when you jailbreak and get the cydia, it comes with cydia. Other than that I have deleted everything. But still come up with this message. I'm not sure why. <comment106307> I have done that and still have this message. I'm not sure why. <comment106313> It's sounds to me like it's talking about *packages* (e.g. tweaks and themes) rather than sources. Have you tried removing some of those? Also, do you have space on the drive?
