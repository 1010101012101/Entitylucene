Mavericks mail.app to/cc header detail white color <body> my mail.app suddenly stopped showing me to/cc header detail in all emails. I had a better look at it and those headers are there, but are displayed in white color. Details on image:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/E8oei.png" alt="Missing headers"  I tried changing color via Command + T, but it seems that it only changes email color, not text color. I also tried to remove file from ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.mail.plist and restarting the Mail.app, but that didn't help either.   How should I restore to the default behaviour?  <answer126002> In case the system fonts got modified somehow I recommend to reset them.  To do this open the app called Font-book and under the File tab click on the "Restore standard Fonts".  Then, reboot the computer.  That should fix your problem.  <comment147504> Only in "all mails" or other places? <comment147515> Other places as well, practically every email has those fields "blank" <comment147516> Did you somehow modify any of the system fonts ? <comment147517> Open Font-Book.app and under file run restore standard fonts. <comment147533> Helped, thanks! <comment154434> I have the exact same issue, although restoring to standard font didn't helped. I also quit and relaunched the mail.app, restart the computer, but still no luck. any other tip you can share? <comment167982> I am having the same difficulties. Has any one found the solution? <comment167983> nevermind, "restore Standard Fonts" and a reboot worked.
