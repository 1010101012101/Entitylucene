How to run Unison through automator? <body> I like to set up unison through Automator to run in the background to sync up two of my folders in a dropbox-like manner, but Automator apparently fails to run unison through shell script. I have tried both the regular terminal command:  precodeunison /folder1 /folder2 /code/pre  and the full path for unison:  precode/usr/local/Cellar/unison/2.40.102/bin/unison /folder1 /folder2 /code/pre  <answer172025> You will want to run it through Apple Script and iTerm.  precodetell application "iTerm"     make new terminal     tell the current terminal         activate current session          launch session "Default Session"         tell the last session             write text "unison /folder1 /folder2"         end tell         terminate the last session      end tell end tell /code/pre  Remember to double forward slash for space in the path in your folder roots.  I am not sure how to run it in the background. This script will bring the iTerm to focus.  <comment202470> How does Automator fail? Does it bring up an error message?
