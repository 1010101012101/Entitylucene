What devices can I Airplay to? <body> With AirPlay will I be able to stream to iPhone, iPod Touch, and/or iTunes, or is it only to Apple TV and 3rd party speakers?  <answer5107> Yes.  Airplay is really a technology platform that allows for streaming media on a local network. It isn't concerned with the type of device that is producing the media or consuming it.  To start with, support may be limited and may not come from Apple. However, certainly that will change with demand. For example:  ul liThere is an iOS app called AirPlayer which allows streaming of media to an iPhone/iPod/iPad./li liThere is a Mac proof-of-concept app also called AirPlayer which allows streaming of media to a Mac./li /ul  <answer12517> Looks like Banana TV is a currently shipping Mac app (not just a proof-of-concept) that will play Airplay video or images from your iPhone/iPad.  (TUAW review)  <answer30042> Airserver allows you to stream Airplay audio and video from your iOS device to your Mac. Works great.  <answer245877> You can Airplay strongto/strong Windows, Mac, Android, or Amazon Fire using Reflector 2. It claims to support sending rom iOS 9 devices also (but I personally haven't tested the iOS 9 support yet).  Reflector installs an app that acts as an AirPlay and Google Cast receiver. The app is available for Windows, Mac, Android, or Amazon Fire. Since Reflector supports receiving both AirPlay and Google Cast it can receive audio/video from iOS or Android.  It's from Squirrels, the same company that makes the excellent AirParrot app (which allows you send AirPlay audio and video strongfrom/strong Windows and Mac strongto/strong AirPlay and Google Cast).  <comment4068> this is a duplicate of http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3820/what-devices-can-receive-an-ios-airplay-audio-stream <comment4078> No it's not exactly, that is about streaming to old Apple Tv I'm want to know about streaming **to** a Mac or iPhone <comment4816> OK, I've edited your question to make that clearer and I'm reopening <comment13336> Reading the AirPlayer link, that doesn't use Apple's AirPlayâ€”it uses UPnP or DLNA. Hence, AirPlay devices such as the AppleTV *cannot* stream to the (unfortunately-named) AirPlayer iOS app.
