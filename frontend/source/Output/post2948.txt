When is the locate database updated? <body> I use the codelocate/code command in Terminal regularly. When does its database get updated? On other systems, I could run codeupdatedb/code as root to force it to update.  Note: I know using codemdfind/code to search with spotlight is another option  <answer2953> From the locate manpage:  precodeFILES  /var/db/locate.database          locate database  /usr/libexec/locate.updatedb     Script to update the locate database  /etc/periodic/weekly/310.locate  Script that starts the database rebuild /code/pre  By default, the database is rebuilt weekly through launchd.  You can run codelocate.updatedb/code manually to do the update.  <answer2954> The locate database is updated by the following cronjob:  precode/private/etc/periodic/weekly/310.locate /code/pre  On Most Mac systems, Cron has been replaced by launchd, and you'll find that code/etc/crontab/code doesn't exist. The schedule for this scheduled job is determined by launchd, and can be seen with one of the following commands:  precode% cat /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.periodic-weekly.plist     #### SNIP &lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Hour&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;integer&gt;3&lt;/integer&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Minute&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;integer&gt;15&lt;/integer&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Weekday&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;integer&gt;6&lt;/integer&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; /code/pre  Or, something a little more user friendly:  precode% open /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.periodic-weekly.plist /code/pre  codelaunchd/code will then run the jobs specified in code/etc/periodic/{daily,weekly,monthly}/*/code, using this schedule.  <answer15691> codesudo periodic weekly/code is the easiest way to kick it off the weekly script which will call the normal rebuild of the locate database.  As noted codelaunchd/code will start this script Saturdays at 03:15 AM if the mac is running. If the mac is sleeping at that time, it will run when the mac wakes. It won't run if the mac is powered off at the magic moment.  <comment2616> On most Mac systems, `cron` is replaced by launchd. There is no /etc/crontab by default, for example. That was moved to launchd. <comment2620> @Stefan - Your right.  I forgot about that change, which Apple did in Tiger. <comment2627> tl;dr version: Saturdays at 3:15 AM local time. <comment17085> Or if the mac is sleeping at 3:15 AM Saturday morning, when it wakes. <comment17124> Yet another way to see the contents of the plist: `defaults read /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.periodic-weekly`
