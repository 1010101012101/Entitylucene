Sharing mac WiFi over Ethernet breaks all internet connections <body> I'm trying to share internet from my macbook to my iMac. The macbook connects via WiFi, and I want to share it's internet over ethernet to the iMac.  WHen I set this up in sharing and turn on internet sharing, my macbook loses all internet connectivity. I can only get it back by turning off sharing and then disconnecting and reconnecting to my WiFi. My settings are below: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kOG9o.png" alt="enter image description here"  The iMac doesn't get any connectivity either. It recognises that there is an ethernet connection and it get's an IP, but it can't access the internet.  <answer110864> The order of your internet connections is reversed.   For internet connection sharing to work it should be:  "Share your connection from Ethernet"   "To computers using Wi-Fi".

It's okay to include a link, but please summarize or excerpt it in the answer. The idea is to make the answer stand alone. <comment130564> Across about 5 Macs and 4 versions of the OS (Snow Leopard to Mavericks) I have *never* been able to get sharing of my wifi connection over ethernet.
