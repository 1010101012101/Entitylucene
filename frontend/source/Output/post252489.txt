How can I tell what Albums a Picture is in with my iCloud Photo Library <body> A few months back I moved all my pictures from my pc/mac to iCloud Photo Library in a hope to better organise them at the time of taking them (or as soon as I get a sec after) rather than 3 months later while copying them to my PC.  Now I know I can add a photo to multiple albums and that albums don't contain copies of photo's but instead pointers to them and editing one will edit all etc... which is great as I have learned to use the albums more like tags so a photo from a trip might be in an album for that trip as well as one for "food" if it has food and maybe "sister" if it has my sister in. This makes finding a pic later really simple by just looking in the album that relates to something I remember the photo had.  Thanks to this smart album trick I can easily sort them all BUT I can't work out how to tell what albums a picture is actually in bar going though them all manually looking for that photo.  h1SO Question:/h1  Is it possible on ether an iOS device or Mac to find out all the albums a picture is in?
