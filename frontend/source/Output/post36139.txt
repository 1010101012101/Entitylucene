Add contact as a Homescreen shortcut for the iPhone 4S? <body> Is it possible to add a contact to the homescreen as a shortcut ?? (like the Nokia and Android phones ).  <answer36146> So far, it's not a feature of iOS. You need to a find (web-)app solution:  e.g.  h3Speedtouchapp/h3  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0biuB.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment41238> How safe are these apps, I just stumbled upon many others in the appstore. They state that the contact details run through their servers but none are saved in their database ... are these apps safe ? <comment41239> If I were to give an answer, it would be speculation. You need to trust the developers and the ratings in the App Store. That's the best advice you can get.
