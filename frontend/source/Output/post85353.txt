Disabling Command + Arrow scrolling <body> When I press kbdCommand &#8984;/kbd+kbd&uarr;/kbd or kbdCommand &#8984;/kbd+kbd&darr;/kbd on OS X 10.8.2 (Mountain Lion), it scrolls all the way to the top or the bottom of a window.   The problem is, in some programs, this results in crazy uncontrollable scrolling behavior, because for whatever reason the program doesn't signal to the OS that it's hit the end of its scrolling. It's driving me nuts.   Is there any way to turn off this behavior? I've searched System Preferences  Keyboard settings to no avail.  <answer85400> If your intention is to emglobally/em override this behaviour, this will do the trick:  Create a file called codeDefaultKeyBinding.dict/code and write on it the following:  precode    {       "@\UF700" = "noop:";       "@\UF701" = "noop:";     } /code/pre  code@\UF700/code is the Unicode value for kbdCommand/kbd+kbdUp/kbd while code@\UF701/code is for kbdCommand/kbd+kbdDown/kbd.  Save it and place it under code~/Library/KeyBindings//code. If the folder doesn't exist, just create it.  A strongdifferent/strong approach would be to override this emshortcuts/em on each of the Applications you're having troubles with, assigning the emproblematic/em shortcuts to the Application's function you usually don't use, for instance.   <comment98434> Thanks! I will give this a shot. Could you elaborate a bit on your "different" approach — how would I override this in an application-specific way? <comment98436> @nucleon [Here](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/72571/create-keyboard-shortcuts-for-menu-bar-items-that-dont-have-shortcuts/72739#72739) :)
