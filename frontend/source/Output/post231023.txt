Watch WWDC videos on Apple TV (4th gen) <body> On the 4th generation of Apple TV, is there a way to watch the presentations delivered at the annual Apple World Wide Developer Conference?  The videos can be viewed on a Mac and on iOS devices. But for some geeks like me, lounging on the couch while watching WWDC vids on the big screen would be considered fun.  <answer231081> If you have a paid developer account for AppleTV you can download, compile and install WWDC-tvOS. You can also download the OSX version (via the same link) and use Airplay to show the videos on your AppleTV.
