High-pitch sound coming from my macbook pro when I move a wired mouse <body> I have a Macbook Pro Retina and when I move my wired mouse (mionix Naos, but same with others) there is a high pitch sound coming from my mac.   It does not make any sound if I don't move the mouse, or if I the integrated trackpack.  The sound comes from the mac. If I use headphones the sound does not come from it, but form the mac.  <answer262409> This has to be one of the strangest things I have ever heard happening. And I've been supporting Macs since the IIci was top of the line. That said, unless someone else has another Idea I would make a Genius appointment take it into an Apple store to have them have a look.  A couple of things to check. Does the noise happen with the mouse plugged into any port? Does it happen with a wireless (with a dongle) or Bluetooth mouse? Where exactly is the noise coming from? one or more speakers, or another part of the Mac? Take the answers to those (that you can determine) to the Apple store.   <answer264842> Since today, I noticed same behavior with my MacBook Pro Retina 15" (Early 2013) using a USB mouse (Roccat Kone XTD). The sound seems to come right from below the area around V key. Looking at the teardown images, right below on the logic board is an inductor and a Texas Instruments TPS51980 chip (power controller?), which could produce the noise.  I found out that when I unplug the PSU, the buzzing seems to be quieter (but still a bit hearable).  <answer267249> I'm experiencing the exact same thing with my Macbook Pro 15" Retina (Mid 2014) using both the Logitech G Pro and older G500.   However, I noticed that strongchanging the polling rate/strong for the mouse from 1000 to 250 makes the sound very hard to hear, though the higher polling rates of 500 and 1000 makes the sound more audible. Happens with either USB input and even if both mice are plugged in at the same time. Unplugging the power adapter does not make any real difference.  <comment333672> I'm experiencing the exact same thing with my Macbook Pro 15" Retina (Mid 2014) using both the Logitech G Pro and older G500.

Would like to create an answer so that I can mark this as resolved? <comment335257> yes sure. It is done and happy it helped you out :)
