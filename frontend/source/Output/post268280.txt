Macbook Pro CPU throttling <body> I'm new user of a brand new 15" Mid 2015 MacBook Pro (i7 processor), which I got about a month ago. I've been having problems with performance.  Every time I try to do anything more CPU consuming than browsing the internet (for example opening a project in IntelliJ or compiling a Java project), my Mac becomes extremely slow.  I noticed that CPU is working on 800 MHz frequency but CPU temperature is low. Fans stay quiet all the time (~2000 rpms). When I need power from my CPU it slows down, but I don't think it should.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vnqfE.png" width="358" title="cpu freq mac os"/  I also tried live USB Ubuntu and I simulated some load and the result was the same, you can see it on the screen. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lCkXj.jpg" alt="ubuntu temps"  I also tried SMC reset but no result. Does it look like hardware failure?  Example of Activity monitor processes listing while throttling below. After longer build Idle is almost 0%, temperature is okay, frequency is 800MHz. Process kernel_task is sometimes using much more CPU img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/i3VjW.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment336770> What does Activity monitor say? <comment336855> I added screen from Activity monitor to my post.
