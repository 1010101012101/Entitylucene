Blank Mail.app HTML Emails in 10.11.6 (Beta) 15G7a <body> A family member somehow got an automatic software update to Beta 15G7a that was released Â±24 hours ago.  He's very happy to accept PICNIC or CBI as responses to usual support from me, so it's puzzling as to how he was assigned a public beta.  Since the update any emails in Mail.app with an attachment, or HTML based emails, refuse to show the message body.  The application will show the attachments exist, but Quick Look will spin and spin forever trying to access them.  This applies to both a GMX IMAP and a Gmail account, and is almost 100% correlated with the timing of the OS X update.  There's very little information available, and all suggestions of deleting indexes (which I can't find in V2/MailData) or rebuilding mailboxes fail/do not resolve it.  Machine has been bounced multiple times, and mail killed/relaunched.  Are they are alternatives to flushing this out without reinstalling an older build of OS X?  <comment293889> Good question - thanks for tagging it appropriately with the build version on the beta. Let's edit out the assumption on reverting - that's a different ball of wax and generally a painless process on OS X.
