How to use it?  <answer287859> After doing a little research on this, my conclusions are that you can try:  ol listrongRestarting your machine./strong If you haven't restarted your machine since plugging in the USB drive then I would try that. Once you do, try reformatting the USB./li listrongRunning as root./strong In Terminal type in codesudo su/code, press kbdenter/kbd and then type in your password. Then issue the commands, being careful to type them in exactly as you need./li listrongBooting into Safe mode./strong Another method is using Safe Mode, as this should allow you to encounter fewer errors than using terminal as a regular user. To boot into Safe Mode, immediately press and hold the kbdShift/kbd key down after booting up - strongkeep it down/strong until you see the login screen./li /ol  Finally, did you ever interrupt the formatting process at any time? Doing that can pose issues, so booting into Safe Mode is a good option.  strongResources:/strong    ul lihttps://origin-discussions-us.apple.com/thread/4806895?start=0&amp;tstart=0/li lihttps://apple.stackexchange.com/a/225061/242879  /li lihttps://askubuntu.com/a/771326/li /ul  <answer287927> The likely answer is that Microsoft has configured this flash drive as read-only to avoid tampering. You'll likely not be able to reuse it for anything else. This is a known practice among certain software manufacturers.  <comment363507> If the stick is legal for someone else to use, trade for a blank stick.  I almost never use Office, but I wouldn't mind having it.  I'd even trade a sixteen-Gig stick for it. <comment363514> This Microsoft-style help I don't believe is suitable in this case. See my answer below.
