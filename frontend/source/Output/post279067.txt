Pressing "Continue" (twice, because the first time shows the same message as a modal dialog), shows me a dialog for entering my Apple ID password (icon is a keyring, if that's relevant).  Entering my Apple ID password shows me "strongiCloud Preferences wants to make changes to your account. Type your password to allow this./strong" (this only accepts my device account password, not that it's clear from the appearance).  Entering the password for my user account on my MacBook Air shows the following message on my MacBook Air:     bGo to one of your other devices signed in to iCloud to approve this MacBook Air./b      img src="https://doxz7msmg7sxx.cloudfront.net/skin/frontend/base/default/images/scp-ajax-loader.gif" alt="spinner" / Waiting for approval…   And then it just sits there.

In the end I resorted to contacting Apple who were extremely helpful. The thing to do is access another device which is logged in with the same iCloud account, and ensure that keychain is switched on. If it isn't, turn it on. From there just follow it through and if you have to reset your keychain data then do it. You'll then be able to get around the original 'Waiting for approval' issue on the initial device.  <comment368016> Did u manage to solve the problem? <comment368158> @Sarim Nope. Gave up in the end, tried to disable it, found I *still* got the messages despite that, and having a chat with Apple support on Twitter about how to fully disable it.
