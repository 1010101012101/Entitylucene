Basic photo editing on OS X <body> I need to edit a photo on my Mac. I wish to take two photos and paste them together to create one that's larger, containing both. I couldn't figure out how to do this with iPhoto.  ul liFor Windows you have Paint.NET.   /li liFor Linux you have Kolourpaint./li /ul  What would be the equivalent on OS X?  Please note that it must be of quality both in code and in UI. I wouldn't want to install buggyware on my Mac.  <answer69498> The best simple image editor is Seashore. It's an open-source Cocoa app built around GIMP's technology. That means it provides advanced photo editing capabilities for free and does it in a simple-to-install native app.  <answer69502> For a program similar to Paint.NET on Windows, check out Pinta, which is available for OS X, Linux and Windows. It requires the Mono framework (link available on the download page for Pinta).  <answer69505> The online, flash-based Pixlr is excellent: very intuitive and has shockingly good performance.  <answer69509> You can do this simply with Preview. Open the first picture.   ol liChoose Tools  Rectangular Selection./li liSelect the whole picture./li liCopy the selection (choose Edit  Copy)./li liChoose Tools  Adjust Size./li liTurn off the lock for proportional changes./li liSelect pixels as your unit./li liDouble the width of your picture./li /ol  At this point, you have your unscaled picture in the clipboard and a scaled version in Preview.  ol liInsert (choose Edit  Paste) the picture from the clipboard and align it to the left edge./li liOpen your second picture in Preview, select everything, and copy it./li liSwitch to the first picture, paste the second picture and align it to the right edge./li liSave your new picture. Done./li /ol  <answer84313> I would say that Preview is just fine for basic touch ups, though it is not that intuitive from the very start. I discovered the editing tools a month after I was using it to preview images:) There are free trials available for most of high quality photo apps, so you may check Collage, Camerabag, Snapheal, and other. All apps work independently on your Mac, so you need no online photo editors. Hope this helps.   <comment80740> Thanks for including a link. Why do you think Seashore is the best? What features lend it to the OP's use case? <comment80748> Nice good to know fact! Thanks. <comment80749> I will check Seashore out. Thank you. <comment80750> Do I need to install Mono(http://www.mono-project.com/MonoMac) on the Mac to have this working? If so then this is a by definition no go because of bloatware. I wound't want to install a whole new framework just to edit a picture. <comment97032> Welcome to AskDifferent! Can you please add links (and maybe a short description/recommendation) for the mentioned applications to make the answer useful without relying on Google? <comment243312> Maxim, Paint.Net also uses the .Net framework, which is including on all Windows machines, but still conceptually similar to Mono which Pinta requires.  I just started using Pinta, and it is a relief to finally find something equivalent to Paint.Net, which I used for years before moving to Mac. <comment275667> I also had not realized Preview could edit images. But you can do most of basic image editing: crop, rotate, cut, paste, color enhancement, markup, etc.
