Blank/Black Screen on AppleTV when mirrored from iMac <body> Using macOS Sierra 10.12.5, iMac 27-inch Mid 2011, AppleTV Model A1469 7.2.2 (8015) Connected via WiFi  I have an Apple TV that used to work, however, now whenever I mirror or extend my display from my iMac it only shows a blank/black screen with audio.   I found this post, Apple TV Black screen (OS X Yosemite ) however, the solutions there did not work for me, and I am not sure how it worked for the OP.  I also found How to Fix an Apple TV with a Blank Screen and reset my Apple TV to factory settings, but still the same problem persists.  The audio works fine and I can switch between internal speakers and the AppleTV but there's no video on the AppleTV.  Any ideas at all are greatly appreciated...  <answer295202> I had a similar issue while using an Apple TV to connect a TV to my MacBook Pro (via LAN) and playing around with the different display modes as it suddenly stopped working.  Unfortunately, I don't remember any details any more but (after several failed attempts) I solved it by explicitly selecting strongOff/strong in System Preferences/Display/Monitor/Dropdown Box emAirport-Monitor/em (maybe detaching and reattaching the ethernet cable and/or turning off/on Apple TV were also involved) and reselecting Apple TV again.  This might be important, as deliberately selecting might have reset and/or stored parameters, which may explain why some people experience negative results.  Sorry, if this was too less of information.  <comment372514> Please include your iMac model/year and what version of macOS you are currently using. <comment372548> Please also include your Apple TV model and its firmware version. Is your Apple TV connected to your network via Wi-Fi? <comment372678> Have you rebooted your entire network? Turn off or disable wifi on all connected devices, then do whatever you need to do to reset your internet router and wi-fi transmitter, (usually just a power cycle of the equipment,) then restart or enable wi-fi devices. As an experiment: what happens when you hard-wire (ethernet) the iMac and the ATV through a switch (router, etc)? <comment372681> Thank you for your suggestion, The AppleTV is accessing the internet with no problems, I can tell from the main menu
