List & documentation for Open Directory properties <body> Anyone know where I can find documentation on the various properties available for directory services on the Mac?  codeman dscl/code only tells me that I emcan/em code-create/code or code-read/code a record. It doesn't tell me emhow/em to create them; what properties are available and the options can be set on each. I know a few (codeRealName/code, codeUniqueID/code, codePrimaryGroupID/code, codeUserShell/code) but where can I find documentation on emall/em of them?   <answer47147> There is a document from Apple called "Mac OS X Server Open Directory Administration For Version 10.4 or Later".  Read Appendix "Mac OS X Directory Data", it contains all what you ask about:  ul li"Standard Attributes in Group Records" at page 222/li li"Standard Attributes in User Records" at page 217/li /ul  Here is excerpt from the last one:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/s5iQX.png" alt="open directory attributes"  â€¦  You can get strongthis/strong document here.  hr  There are a lot of strongnewer documents/strong on Apple site (haven't seen them yet). They may be useful to.
