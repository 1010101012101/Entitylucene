Binding any key combination to move spaces shortcuts <body> Is it possible to edit the keyboard shortcuts so it can be a combination of a modifier key and a mouse button? img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TPOih.png" alt="Keyboard Shortcuts" I would like to change emMove left a space/em to kbdShift/kbd+kbdMouse 5/kbd and emMove right a space/em to kbdShift/kbd+kbdMouse 4/kbd.  I would like to do it natively without having to install third-party applications like Karabiner if possible. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aP1B3.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment310217> What clicks/keys do mouse 4 & 5 provide right now? You can always enter those from the keyboard, then the mouse will send them correctly afterwards, even though the shortcut won't directly accept a mouse-click as input. <comment310267> They produce `Mouse Button 4` and `Mouse Button 5` clicks. See new screenshot. <comment310303> Ah... right - then it's 3rd party time, I'm afraid.
