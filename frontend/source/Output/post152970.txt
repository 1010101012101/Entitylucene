Cannot locate 173 GB backups on hard drive <body> About my Mac Storage states that I have used 173 GB of my hard drive in backups.  Where are these?  My iPhoto library disappeared, and I have been unable to restore through Time Machine because it says I don't have enough space. How can I free the storage or find the backups to restore the iPhoto library.  supOS X 10.9.5/sup  <answer152982> Open the strongTerminal.app/strong and type codesudo du -k | awk '$1 &gt; 500000' | sort -nr/code, this command will search for all Directories bigger than 500MB and sort them by size. So you should find the Location to your Backups.  <comment180143> Did you check the Trash?
