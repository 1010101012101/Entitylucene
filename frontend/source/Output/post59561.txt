Where did Icon Composer go from Xcode? <body> I can't seem to find Icon Composer on the Xcode versions at run on Mountain Lion.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5v3CB.png" alt="enter image description here"  Where is it? Has it been taken out? How to get it back?  <answer59613> It's been moved into one of the add-on packages for Xcode, and is now part of the strongGraphics Tools for Xcode/strong package.  Apparently this is (at least partly?) because this is no longer the 'officially recommended' way to generate (high resolution) icons. See the OS X Human Interface Guidelines and the High Resolution Guidelines for more info.  I believe Icon Composer doesn't support the highest resolution icons required these days (1024x1024), and you're encouraged to use codeiconutil/code instead, which does, and allows you to convert between ICNS and "iconsets" (effectively just a folder containing a collection of PNG files of different resolutions).  hr  If you still want it, you can get it as follows:  In Xcode, go to the strongXcode/strong  strongOpen Developer Tool/strong  strongMore Developer tools.../strong.  You'll need to log in (or register) with your (free) Apple Developer account, and then you'll be shown a list of available packages for Xcode, including the Graphics Tools for Xcode. Grab the latest one and install.  This DMG of Graphics Tools contains:  ul liCI Filter Browser/li listrongIcon Composer/strong/li liOpenGL Driver Monitor/li liOpenGL Profiler/li liOpenGL Shader Builder/li liPixie/li liQuartz Composer/li liQuartz Composer Visualizer/li liQuartz Debug/li /ul  <answer78988> What I found easier than downloading, installing, and finding Icon Composer was using the command-line tool codeiconutil/code.  ol liPut your png files of each size into a folder. The folder must have the extension code.iconset/code/li liEnter this command into the Terminal window:  codeiconutil -c icns &lt;iconset filename&gt;/code  where code&lt;iconset filename&gt;/code is the path to the folder containing the set of pngs./li liThe output code.icns/code file is written to the same location as the folder./li /ol  You must have the following set of pngs:  precodeicon_16x16.png icon_16x16@2x.png icon_32x32.png icon_32x32@2x.png icon_128x128.png icon_128x128@2x.png icon_256x256.png icon_256x256@2x.png icon_512x512.png icon_512x512@2x.png /code/pre  <answer94366> Check out Icon Composer 2x. It's a replacement for Apple's Icon Composer that supports Retina Resolution Icons.  You can get it here: http://www.lemonmojo.com/work#IconComposer2x  I wrote the app, it's free and source code is available on Github if you're interested.  <answer140361> I created a droplet that creates an icon from a PNG using applescript, here's the code:  precode    on open input     repeat with input in input         set inputalias to input as alias         tell application "Finder"             set inputname to name of inputalias             set inputcontainer to container of inputalias         end tell         if inputname ends with ".png" then             set foldername to ((text 1 through ((length of inputname) - 4) in inputname) &amp; ".iconset") as text             tell application "Finder"                 try                     make new folder at inputcontainer with properties {name:foldername}                 end try                 set thefolder to folder foldername of inputcontainer                 set iconnames to "icon_16x16.png icon_16x16@2x.png icon_32x32.png icon_32x32@2x.png icon_128x128.png icon_128x128@2x.png icon_256x256.png icon_256x256@2x.png icon_512x512.png icon_512x512@2x.png"                 set iconnames to paragraphs of iconnames                 repeat with iconname in iconnames                     duplicate inputalias to thefolder with replacing                     set iconfile to file inputname of thefolder                     set name of iconfile to iconname                  end repeat             end tell              set folderpath to POSIX path of (thefolder as alias)             do shell script "iconutil -c icns " &amp; (quoted form of folderpath)             display dialog ("Icon created for " &amp; inputname) giving up after 10             tell application "Finder" to delete thefolder         else             display dialog (inputname &amp; " cannot be made into an icon.

In addition to using Icon Composer, I find that I prefer a utility from iDeveloper - "Icon Generator" to quickly make icons in every required size. It's in the Mac AppStore. <comment89893> Apple sez, "There is no longer a 1024x1024 size. That’s replaced by 512x512@2x," and "Don’t use Icon Composer—it can’t create high-resolution icns files." ...and lastly, "Use iconutil to Create an icns File Manually The iconutil command-line tool converts iconset folders to deployment-ready, high-resolution icns files. (You can find complete documentation for this tool by entering man iconutil in Terminal.)" <comment110660> thanks, that looks useful! I'll test it when I need it again. <comment110674> Actually you are mistaken. Icon Composer in its latest version does support the 1024x1024 size. Just go to the menubar and go to view  Show 1024x1024 or click the 1024x1024 button at the bottom of the window. I have made icons with that size before. <comment188722> What's the difference between, for example, icon_128x128.png and icon_128x128@2x.png? <comment191985> Bravo! Great resource, thank! <comment202056> @andrewrk apparently, that means the resolution of the image should be doubled (2x). So `icon_128x128@2x.png` should be 256x256. <comment202063> @GeorgeEdison ok then what's the difference between icon_128x128@2x.png and icon_256x256.png? <comment202074> @andrewrk: there is no difference in size. This can be verified by using `iconutil` on an `.icns` file and examining the images that result. (Though I'm not sure I understand why either.) <comment248669> @NathanOsman the difference is UID. While a 128x128@2x may be technically able to display the same data as an 256x256@1x, the output would be a lot smaller on the 128 variant and as such a human looking at it may benefit from simplified graphics at 2x resolutions. <comment330506> For future on-lookers: step.1: open applescript step.2: copy and paste the code JoeFrizzell posted above. Step.3: save as .app Step.4: drag and drop your .png onto the .app you just created. <comment333405> FYI: Icon Composer is no longer available in Additional Tools for Xcode 8.2 <comment350861> Also just posting to say thanks for making this tool. Sure I could do it from the command line, but this made it a whole lot easier and faster.
