Does the video player truncate videos? <body> The iPad screen has an aspect ratio of 4:3. 1080p video has an aspect ratio of 16:9.  I tried playing a 1080p video on the built-in player and got this:  precode|--------------| |   |      |   | |   | iPad |   | |   |      |   | |--------------| /code/pre  where the outer border is the movie resolution (meaning, the video is getting chopped). I am a bit surprised that I couldn't find a mention of this anywhere online. strongDoes the iPad really truncate 1080p videos by dropping pixels on the left/right of the frame?/strong  <answer112876> This is simply an option to allow people to change between filling the screen or showing the black bars.  It can be switched by strongdouble-tapping the video/strong, or tapping the two arrows button on the toolbar.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vqXvG.jpg" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PkE5t.jpg"
