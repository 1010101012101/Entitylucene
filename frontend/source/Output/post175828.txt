Connect to https without SSL connection <body> When I am at college I sometimes need to access websites such as http://draw.io (for designing networks diagrams). The only issue is I cannot go to on my own laptop (MacBook Air) since the open Wi-Fi at college does not have SSL.  Is there a way how I can access sites like this?  I have tried both Safari and Chrome but none of them work.  I have also tried using a VPN (a Google Chrome plugin) however my college have blocked them. The only way for me to use sites that require SSL is using codeTor/code.  If you need screenshots to make it clearer I will add them tomorrow (Monday) when I am at college.  I would like to use Safari instead of Chrome Since I will have to install it again.  <comment207492> Frankly, I'd complain at the owner of the WiFi. Not being able to use SSL these days is prehistoric. <comment207493> I think it is the way how computing services set it up. It is probably because it doesn't have a password and they may need to monitor traffic. Only fix for now is to use `Tor Browser` however it can be slow sometimes. <comment207494> I'd find a Starbucks at lunchtime. If there's no SSL, there's no SSL. Unless the site you're looking at has an unsecured version, you're out of luck. SSL requires both ends to shake hands. <comment207496> There is MacDonalds near by! That is however 10 mins away. My breaks are only 30 mins (after every lesson). <comment207497> That gives you 10 mins download/burger time ;-) I really don't think there is any way round it, otherwise.
