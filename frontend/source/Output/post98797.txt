Trying to find the /etc/resolve <body> I'm trying to connect a Macbook Air running 10.8.4 to a Windows 2008 R2 server. I have run into trouble as we use a codecompany.local/code.  I think this may be the problem: http://blog.scottlowe.org/2006/01/04/mac-os-x-and-local-domains/.  So, I have gone into terminal and typed codeopen /private/code and navigated to the codeetc/code folder but can not find a resolve folder, only a coderesolv.conf/code file.  How do I go about adding the name server?  <answer98798> That is a 7 year old link!  Try just opening the resolv.conf file which is a text file that contains a list of DNS servers.  It may be blank, in which case you can just add lines using the following format as an example:  precodenameserver 172.16.1.254 nameserver 172.16.2.254 /code/pre  Check this link for a bit more  <answer98836> The way OS X handles .local domains changes frequently between versions of, and as @stuffe said, that's a very old link so its advice is pretty much irrelevant now. For 10.8.4, Apple recommends adding the .local domain to the DNS Search Domains list in Network preferences.  (For versions OS X 10.6 and 10.7, see KB article #TS4041 instead.)  <comment116143> This won't work, as OS X doesn't actually use /etc/resolv.conf.
