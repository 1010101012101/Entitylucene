How can I listen to just part of a single song, or just skip some time? <body> Sometimes I just want to listen to part of a song.   In Youtube I can set start/end times for a particular video.  I'm listening to this song and only want to start at 2:50, and end somewhere else.   This example is a 6 minute song... but I'm sure there are other refrains/etc in pop music that could want this.  <answer281885> If you have access to a Mac, you can right-click the song, then go into strongGet Info/strong → strongOptions/strong, where you can then set both strongStart/strong and strongStop/strong times.  These preferences will propagate to your iOS devices next time you synchronize them to your iTunes Music Library. If you subscribe to strongiTunes in the Cloud/strong (via iTunes Match or MUSIC), that will be done over the air.  This is a persistent modification that will apply every time you listen to that song (until you reset the strongStart/strong and strongStop/strong times).
