Geeky terminal for OS X <body> I want to bind a certain command to show a terminal on screen without window frame with the command of my choice. I plan to use it to quickly launch network monitoring tools (trafshow) when I use a certain key combination. I should be able to specify the position of the terminal window, make it non-interactive, etc. I can specify the position and options through config file or command-line.  Is there any software I can use or does any of the popular terminal applications have this feature?  <answer53402> Try GeekTool. Might be interesting to you.  <answer53403> Perhaps you might want to consider TotalTerminal? (formerly Visor)
