Can't select option in OSX Utilities <body> I'm having a pretty bizarre problem in OSX Mavericks. I'm attempting to install a fresh version of the OS, so I boot to OSX Utilities (Cmd+R). The option that I'm looking for is listed (re-install operating system), but I can't select it or anything else from the list.  I can move the mouse around, but clicking does not work. I tried with both the trackpad as well as a USB mouse. I can navigate through the options with the arrow keys, but pressing enter has no effect.  How the heck am I supposed to do anything from the utilities?  <answer189914> To get around this problem I went to the option I wanted with the strongarrow keys/strong then got frustrated when I couldn`t click.  What I proceeded to do was start in the bottom right with the options key and push all the buttons across and up the next two rows skipping the Cap Locks. The continue button then illuminated. To then select it I pushed the strongspace bar/strong. Hope this works    <answer194602> As per the above - I had this issue, but I found that although I couldn't 'tap' on my trackpad, I could 'click' (press on bottom left of pad). Alternatively, the Tab key will move the cursor between sections of the window, arrow keys high-light an item within it, and the space bar selects it  <answer220219> After you highlight the option you want with the arrow keys, press the "tab" button to highlight "continue" and then press spacebar to select.   <comment131026> Are you running the OS X Install application from your internal hard drive or from a separate volume (external hard disk, USB stick, etc.)? If the former, could it be that your Mac won't let you "write over" the existing installation? <comment232176> OP states that he tried a USB mouse and that pressing enter does not work.
