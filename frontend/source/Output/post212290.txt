Number pad produces strange output in certain commands in Terminal <body> Running OS X 10.10.5 (Yosemite)  Well, something happened to my system (I can honestly say it wasn't me but), I was unable to use the USB keyboard number pad while using commands such as 'less', 'more' (and perhaps 'vim' and 'nano') in the OS X Terminal.  It would type output codeESCOq/code for 1, codeESCOr/code for 2, codeESCOs/code for 3, ..., codeESCOp/code for 0.  When exiting the programs, the USB keyboard number pad would work just fine in the terminal.  <answer212291> Go to Terminal - Preferences - Profile - Advanced, and uncheck 'Allow VT100 application keypad mode'.
