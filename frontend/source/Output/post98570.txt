Alias to ssh and cd into a specific directory <body> I want an alias to SSH into another machine and then CD into a specific directory.  I try:  precodealias appl="ssh 9@lon.orb.com; cd /opt/tomcat/instances/" /code/pre  It does not work.  Any ideas?  <answer98571> If you mean that the cd should work in the remote machine, then this cannot work.  You could change your code~/.bash_profile/code to do this cd for every login or just from certain machines.  <answer98573> It doesn't work because the codecd/code is executed on your local machine when the codessh/code does terminate.  Here is the way to do it:  precodealias appl="ssh 9@lon.orb.com 'cd /opt/tomcat/instances ; exec ${SHELL} -i'" /code/pre
