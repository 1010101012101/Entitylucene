iPad Mini streaming from ethernet USB via Chromecast <body> Will an iPad Mini talk to a Mac Pro on my local ethernet lan via wifi?  I want to stream video files from a USB drive on the Mac Pro to a Chromecast using the iPad.  Should work, but?????  <comment345933> Assuming that both your ethernet LAN and Wi-Fi are connected to the same router, then generally this should be possible. However, can you clarify (perhaps with an example) exactly _how_ it is you're trying to do what you want to do? It's not exactly clear to me.
