how to connect to a HTTP Proxy only if it is available <body> I am trying to view my website - hosted on my local server - from my iPhone. I am doing this my adding a http proxy information into my iPhone. Basically I am following This tutorial, it works perfectly  However, if I turn off my mac (my local server: the information needed for the http proxy), the internet connection on my iPhone would not work. So I need to turn off the http proxy when my local server is not running, in order to use the internet. Basically, if I leave the http proxy information in my iPhone, I only have internet connection as long as I keep my local server running. Is there a way to leave the http proxy information stored in my iPhone (so that I dont have to retype tham every time I need to test my local websites) and still use the internet?  Thanks  <comment96760> Isn't this the same issue as http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/84096/9058? If yes, can you please combine the two questions into one to make it easier to solve your problem?
