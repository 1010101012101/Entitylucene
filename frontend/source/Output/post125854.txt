Remount drive without physically disconnecting? <body> So I have unmounted a usb external hard drive but I went to re-mount it.  Is there a command that I can use to remount the drive?  Only way I know to re-mount a drive is to disconnect the usb cable from my Mac and reconnect it.  <answer125856> One-liner:  precodediskutil mount `diskutil list | grep "Volume Name" | sed -n -e 's/^.* //p'` /code/pre  hr  ol liFind the disk identifier:  precodediskutil list | grep "Volume Name" /code/pre  subExample result:/sub  pre4:   Apple_HFS Volume Name   100 GB   bdisk1s2/b/pre/li liMount the disk:  precodediskutil mount disk1s2 /code/pre/li /ol  <answer125857> Disk Utility will let you remount any connected drives.

If the disk has multiple volumes (like a Time Machine volume and another volume), you can use codediskutil mountDisk/code to mount all volumes:  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"code$ diskutil mount WD Volume WD on WD mounted $ osascript -e 'tell app "Finder" to disks where ejectable is true' disk WD $ diskutil eject Untitled Disk WD ejected $ diskutil mountDisk WD Volume(s) mounted successfully $ osascript -e 'tell app "Finder" to disks where ejectable is true' disk Time Machine, disk WD /code/pre  codemountDisk/code and codeeject/code apply to all volumes even if you specify the name of one volume.  <answer126287> In addition to the answers already given, there is also a GUI app for this, which I really like: Mountain.  It's a $2 app that sits in the menu bar and keeps track of both mounted and unmounted drives. Unmounted drives can be remounted from there as well.  You can download a free trial from the website.   (Also note that once you install the Mac App Store version, there is an update available directly from the developer. I assume the update isn't on the Mac App Store because of Apple's sandboxing rules.)  <answer238747> Open disc utility though it has been ejected it will show up right click in drop down hit remount  <comment147321> Thanks!  Now I have an alias setup so I quickly remount a volume. <comment147322> All there years of using Disk Utility I never knew you could do this :) <comment147348> Where's that "Windows 8" bit come from? <comment147352> @dfeuer Sorry that was just an example volume name — edited. <comment267599> What if the disk isn't in Disk Utility?  I have a connected drive, I ejected it, and it disappears from Disk Utility. <comment267600> @cullub Did you mean to reply to the other answer about Disk Utility? Anyway, that feature was removed in El Capitan Disk Utility — it doesn't show unmounted disks. <comment267601> No, I was wondering if there was some simple thing I missed in this answer for if the disk wasn't mounted.  Is there any way to do this in El Cap? <comment267604> @cullub This answer works fine for me in El Capitan? Feel free to discuss this in [chat]? <comment292850> How does this improve on other answers especially http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/125857/237
