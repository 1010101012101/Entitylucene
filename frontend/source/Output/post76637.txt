How can I create a custom colored icon font? <body> How can I create custom colored icon font as Apple did for emoticons?  I'd also need a font making tool that imports .svg images.  <answer76647> For font making the common OS X tools are FontLab, FontForge, and Glyphs.   I understand the Color Emoji font uses png color bitmaps in two sizes in a proprietary “sbix” table, but have not yet seen info on how to make that table.  <answer135291> This link explains how to make a custom color font.  http://www.pixelambacht.nl/2014/compyx-a-multicolor-8bit-font/  hope that helps!  <comment160367> Welcome to Ask Different!
