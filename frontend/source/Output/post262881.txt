How do I merge tracks from audiobooks so they are one file instead of 100 separate tracks? <body> Some of my audiobooks download as 1 7-hour long track. Others are in iTunes as 50-100 separate tracks (that sometime get out of order). I would like to merge the tracks so each audiobook appears as one long file/track. How do I do this?  <answer262886> I use the software Audiobook Builder to merge single tracks from an audiobook to one file. Afterwards you can delete the originals if you want. You can find the programm in the Mac App Store.  <comment329328> Related: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/174327/join-merge-consolidate-many-audio-book-cds-into-one-or-a-few-albums-in-itunes-12/174341#174341, but the "Join CD Tracks" option is not shown in my case (probably because I didn't import from CD)
