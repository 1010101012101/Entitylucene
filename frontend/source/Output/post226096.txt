Increase amount of text copied in iterm2 <body> When I select text in iTerm2, the text it copies cuts off at after a certain (seemingly arbitrary) point.  I did a few tests and its usually between 800 and 1500 bytes of input.  Why is this, and how can I change the settings in iTerm2 to allow me to copy all the text I highlight?  strongNote:/strong I don't have this problem in the default "terminal" application, just in iterm.  <answer226120> It should copy all text you have selected.  You should check under PreferencesProfiles in the Terminal tab how big your scrollback buffer is.  However it is specified in lines not bytes.  <comment274543> Check that your iTerm2 is a recent version <comment274547> Good idea, but the scrollback buffer for my active profile is already set at 1000 lines. <comment274548> I'm running `Build 2.1.4`, which is the latest one listed here: https://www.iterm2.com/downloads.html
