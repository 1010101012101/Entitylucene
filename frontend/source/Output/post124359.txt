Am I being charged to use my personal hotspot for my iPhone 4s? (AT&T carrier) <body> So I remember having the personal hotspot option for my 3gs, but I could never turn it on because it wasn't part of my plan. Now that I have a 4s, I've recently learned that the personal hotspot feature is enabled on my phone. (The phone is part of a family plan if I'm not mistaken.) Does that mean that my plan was upgraded to a business plan that includes the hotspot feature or that I am being charged some additional fee every time I enable it and use it?  <answer124429> Yah, log into your account on att.com and check. AT&amp;T charges for EVERYTHING (and then some) and it is unlikely that you have a personal hotspot for free.  <answer133336> AT&amp;T "Mobile Share" Family plans allow hotspot usage.   precodeMobile hotspot is included for capable devices. /code/pre  Hotspot usage was not allowed for individual plans without an extra fee, and was not available at all to the old unlimited data plans.    AT&amp;T will not enable hotspot on your device unless you have an eligible plan already, so you are not risking an additional charge by using it.  Note that you emdo/em need to stay within your data quotas.  <answer200988> If you have family plan it is free. I use it all the time. Check with a rep he or she will confirm   <comment145455> I would check your bill closely. I have Sprint and I know they let me turn on the hotspot if I want and just add a fee to my bill if I do and use it. <comment145482> What does AT&T say?
