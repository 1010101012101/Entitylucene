Mac OS 10.10 httpd.conf file <body> I messed with my httpd.conf file, and I'm not sure what the original one looked like. Can someone upload a copy of their httpd.conf file so I can switch the text in mine with theirs?  <comment212384> Did you check the folder called 'original'  `/private/etc/apache2/original` or the file titled 'httpd.conf~previous', or look in Time Machine ? <comment212440> @Tetsujin not until you said it, thanks!
