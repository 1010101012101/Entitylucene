Hide Apple menu on second monitor <body> How to hide the menu bar that shows up on the second monitor? I tried searching in the following settings:  ul liFinder preferences kbdâŒ˜,/kbd/li liSystem settings :: Desktop &amp; Screensaver/li liSystem settings :: Displays/li /ul  I thought it would be on SS :: Displays :: Arrangement, where we position the menu in one screen or another dragging the white box, but nope. I'm running OS X 10.9.4.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nDFIam.png" alt="settings displays arrangement"   <answer147352> Found the answer in this blog post Hide The Menu Bar On Your Secondary Monitor With Mavericks. Uncheck the option "separate Spaces" on Mission Control:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vYc2f.png" alt="mission control separate spaces"  <comment173724> Unchecking Displays have separate Spaces will restore the classic Spaces behaviour of the extended virtual desktop. Personally, that's behaviour that I prefer. Managing 6 extended desktops is a lot better than 12 separate ones. It keeps my workflow organized. :) <comment173729> +1 I switched off Separate Spaces on day one. I much prefer my screens to shift in pairs.
