Database.db file in Macintosh HD <body> I see a Database.db file with size zero bytes on my Macintosh HD  Is this a system file? i am not sure if this is something i can remove or the purpose of this file  Regards  <answer226385> You're probably fine, but it depends and since it's taking up no space, no good reason to delete it yet. It's simply a database file put there by something (again, probably not OS X.) You should attempt to narrow down what application is using the file (see this post) and then either keep it or delete it as appropriate.  <comment274896> Where is the file? <comment274897> That's what I am wondering I am new to OS X so always want to be careful <comment274898> You have the disk so only you can provide the full path to the file <comment274899> i am sorry Mark, mind plays trick sometime, I read your comment as what is this file <comment274900> This is sitting in / drive <comment274902> What does `ls -l@e /Database.db` show <comment274912> -rw-r--r--  1 companyname  admin  0 Jul  4  2011 Databases.db i think my company put this file here. it could be pushed via Group Policy or something
