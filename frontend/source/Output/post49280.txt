How to change background of Dashboard in Lion <body> I find the default background of Dashboard in Lion quite boring.  I know how to change the defaultdesktop.jpg for the login screen, and I was wondering if there was a similar process for Dashboard.  Thanks.  Current Background "Texture:"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yMOaL.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer49285> The corresponding file seems to be located at  precode/System/Library/CoreServices/Dock.app/Contents/Resources/pirelli.png /code/pre  It's a little piece of the pattern that's tiled: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OoKfs.png" alt=""  You can try replacing this with another tile of the same size, or even a larger image and see if it works! Then relaunch the Dock (from Activity Monitor or codekillall Dock/code) and it should show up.
