I was having trouble updating an app. It would appear to work, then failed with this message:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gvLTe.png" alt="enter image description here"  I had tried many of the suggestions found here, as well as on discussions.apple.com, none of which worked for me.  Some suggestions recommended fiddling with wifi, resetting network settings and setting the DNS to 8.8.8.8.  I couldn't imagine what most of those suggestions would have to do with the problem.  But, I noticed that the common denominator to many suggestions revolved around networking.  So, it gave me the idea to try the VPN app on my phone.  I tried that and Bingo!  Just connecting to the VPN allowed me to complete the update.  To be clear about how I connected to a VPN, I used the PIA app from Apple's App Store.  I'm sure there are many VPN options.  But, the point is that the connection was made to a VPN server from a VPN client residing on my iPhone.  This is an iPhone 5S, by the way.  <comment246870> This question lacks basic research on what you've done to solve the issue. It also lacks any sort of specifics.
