How do I use non-"legacy" launchctl commands to load and unload plists? <body> I have some plist files in code~/Library/LaunchAgents/code.  I have been happily using codelaunchctl load -w/code and codelaunchctl unload -w/code to turn these on and off for years.  However, I notice that now codeload/code and codeunload/code are relegated to the "legacy" section of the man page.  Let's call one of them codecom.example.service.plist/code.  However, when I try to interact with these plists via codelaunchctl enable "gui/$(id -u)/com.example.service"/code and codelaunchctl disable "gui/$(id -u)/com.example.service"/code, other launchd commands emseem/em to report success - for example, codelaunchctl print "gui/$(id -u)"/code totally shows me disabled flags that correspond to the state that I've set - the services don't actually start and stop or listen and unlisten on their ports.  Is there some step I'm missing?  For the moment I am sticking with codeload/code and codeunload/code but I'd like to learn the non-deprecated way of interacting with this stuff before Apple eventually slams the door on the old/bad way...  <answer234935> I asked the Twitter user @launchderp:     @launchderp Arecodelaunchctl load/code and unload still safe to use, at least until 10.12 or whatever comes next?       c.f How do I use non-&quot;legacy&quot; launchctl commands to load and unload plists?   And @launchderp replied     @tjluoma Yeah they're still safe. Too many years of dependencies to break them.   While this may not seem like an official Apple statement, I believe this person to be someone who is actively working on codelaunchd/code for Apple, and trust what they say. YMMV.  strongMoral of the story: If load/unload is working for you, keep using them :-)/strong  <comment274751> The legacy means that a change is afoot - you can still use load and unload to your heart's content on 10.11 and lower. My presumption is Apple will have documentation at WWDC this year and a timeline for migration... <comment274923> I guess there just might not be an answer for this yet, but it sure *looks* like `enable` and `disable` are intended to replace `load` and `unload`.  I just can't get them to work as I expect. <comment275598> Have you tried following `launchctl enable` with `launchctl kickstart`? <comment275846> I have not, but isn't `launchctl kickstart` supposed to just issue an activation for the job in question?  I am using launchd specifically because I want purely on-demand activation. <comment287483> Not marking as "accepted" because it doesn't quite address the question about `enable` and `disable` but upvoted because I still appreciate the information :). <comment288093> This looks like it may help: https://babodee.wordpress.com/2016/04/09/launchctl-2-0-syntax/
