How to connect an iPad 3 to 27" Apple Cinema Display (Mini DisplayPort) <body> How can I connect my iPad 3 (30-pin dock connector) to my 27" Cinema Display (MiniDisplayPort)?   <answer125464> You'll need 2 different adapters :   iPad 3 = Dock to HDMI adapter = HMDI to mini displayport = Cinema Display.   <comment146853> Thanks. Do you know if, when connected in this way, the iPad will scale videos to the full size of the Cinema Display? Or will it be chopped off on each side?
