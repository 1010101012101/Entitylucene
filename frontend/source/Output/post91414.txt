how to move files in terminal osx <body> Hello world so i am way new to mac i am trying to install an older version of codewkhtmltopdf/code because the codebrew install wkhtmltopdf/code installs a rc version that just wont work.   So i found this blog that explains how to install it here. but how can i move the file codewkhtmltopdf-0.9.9-OS-X.i368/code into the /usr/bin dir via the terminal in mac?  <answer91416> Same way you would in any unix command line: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mv  <answer91433> There are 2 answers â˜º:  h1Don't do it!/h1  The codewkhtmltopdf/code wasn't installed in code/usr/bin/code. It shouldn't. This directory is reserved to standard user Unix commands.  Check carefully where codebrew/code installed the last coderc/code version.  The following command will tell you the truth:  precodetype wkhtmltopdf /code/pre  Most probably this installation directory is:  precode/local/bin /usr/local/bin /opt/bin ... /code/pre  h1How to do it/h1  Once you have located where codebrew/code installed your not working coderc/code, let's say it's code/local_installdir/code. Once you have built the previous version in a directory, let's say it's code/local_builddir/code here is how to use codemv/code to place this previous version in place:  precodecd /local_builddir mv wkhtmltopdf /local_installdir /code/pre  If you get a permission denied error message on this operation, then you will have to prefix this same command with the usual codesudo/code:  precode/usr/bin/sudo mv wkhtmltopdf /local_installdir /code/pre  <comment107338> What is an "rc version"? Also don't move or edit files in /usr/bin as Apple upgrades will delete them - should be /usr/local/bin <comment107341> "release canidate" so basically not beta just working the kinks <comment107343> I woiuld ask on the brew mailing list why they are giving a rc as that seems risky as you have found <comment107345> Can you summarise (or in this case give the command) not just a link. Also note that this won't work on its own
