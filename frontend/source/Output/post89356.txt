Change OSX system font <body> OS X Mountain Lion: Is there a way to change the default system font?  Things like color (I'd like it slightly more gray) and the type.  EDIT: And Font Weight, if possible. Thanks  <comment104960> Not entirely sure if this is a duplicate question. I agree that the answer to both questions is the same software. But this question specifically asks about font color, type, and weight... while the other one asks about size.
