How can I remove a portion of from the middle of a movie? <body> Quicktime Player help:     With QuickTime Player you can quickly remove a portion of the   beginning or end of a movie or a movie clip to make it shorter or   remove unwanted content.   I want to remove the portion starting at 03:08 and ending at 03:49 of the movie, preferably through an applescript like the following:  precodetell application "QuickTime Player"     activate     trim document 1 from 0 to (4 * 60 + 41.75) end tell  /code/pre  Am pretty sure QT PRO can do it.  <answer37475> If you want to get 3:08 to 3:49 you should use:  precodetrim document 1 from (3*60 + 8) to (3*60 +49) /code/pre  <answer37490> You'll need the more advanced editing features of QuickTime 7. To install it on Snow Leopard or Lion, refer to Installing QuickTime Player 7 on Mac OS X v10.6 or Later on Apple's KB.  You'll then be able to open your video with QT7, select parts of your video with kbdI/kbd (set input point) and kbdO/kbd (set output point), and delete the part with a stroke of kbd⌫/kbd. Then, simply save the file, as said earlier.  You might need a license key for QT7, though (I don't remember if the latest versions of the OS need them or activate the Pro features for free).  em(taken from my answer here, but it felt flaky linking to it when the question is not really the same)/em  <answer186987> You can use Quicktime 10.x to split the movie into multiple clips, and then trim the individual clips. When you're done editing the individual clips and you save/export the movie, you get exactly what you want: one single, continuous movie, sans the parts you trimmed.     h3Split a movie into clips/h3      ol   liIn QuickTime Player, drag the playhead (the small diamond) in the timeline to the location where you want to split your movie./li   liChoose Edit  Split Clip.br   Your movie splits into two clips./li   liTo split one of the clips in two, select the clip, drag the playhead (now represented by a red vertical line) to the location where you want to split the clip, and then choose Edit  Split Clip.br   Your movie is now split into three clips./li   liTo continue splitting clips, repeat step three./li   liWhen you’re done splitting clips, you can rearrange your clips or click Done./li   /ol   https://support.apple.com/kb/PH5884  I haven't investigated it, but there may be an analogous AppleScript API for working with clips.  <comment42446> Have you tried doing it in a little more of a round about way? Duplicate the movie, trim one copy to contain your start (00:00-03:08), trim the second to contain your end (03:49-end), and finally combine the two. <comment42509> Is iMovie an option?  If so, it should be easy enough to cut a clip out. <comment42539> So, what's the question? Is it the one in the title, ie “How can I remove a portion of from the middle of a movie?”, or is it only an Applescript that you want? <comment42568> no i want to remove that portion
