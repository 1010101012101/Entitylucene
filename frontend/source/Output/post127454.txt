os x teleport : login other computer <body> i am now using a second mac at home imac and mac pro. anyways, teleport is a superb solution to using both machines. i am having to reboot the 'remote' machine for various reasons during setup of the new machine because of an aging dvd drive won't mount the inserted drive all the time.  however: when i need to reboot remote 'b' for some reason and remote 'b' gets back to the login prompt, i cannot teleport from 'a' to 'b' to login over there. i'm relegated to swapping the keyboard from 'a' to 'b' each time.   ideas?  <comment149338> disable log in during your sessions <comment149753> not sure i understand. could you expand that a bit?
