Deleting space on my iphone/icloud <body> If I am storing photos on my Dropbox or Google Photos, can I delete them from my iCloud and still access them through these other apps?  <answer291416> Yes, those services are not connected.    However, once you delete items from iCloud, they'll be deleted from every device you have that uses that same Apple ID.  iCloud is a sync services whereas Dropbox and Google Drive are cloud storage that can also be used for backup.    <comment367924> Just wanted to note that iCloud is also a cloud storage platform - especially with iCloud Drive <comment367925> Yes, sort of.  I didn't want to muddy the water with that because the 1) OP appears to be a new/inexperienced Apple user and 2) he didn't ask about Drive and I didn't want to cause confusion by adding that part.
