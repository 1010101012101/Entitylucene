MacBook Air - Trackpad and Keyboard work in Bootloader but not in OS <body> Over the past year I experienced increasing trackpad and keyboard blackouts until they stopped working totally. After opening the case I found the touchpad flex cable slightly displaced in the trackpad socket. I fixed that, but the Trackpad still didn't work in the OS.  In the bootloader though, trackpad and keyboard work like charm. At the Genius Bar they couldn't explain this behavior and just suggested to start exchanging all relevant parts.  I doubt though, that it is a trackpad hardware or cable issue.  My explanation would be, that while running the bootloader, the signal of the input devices are processed in a somehow simpler way. As soon as an OS starts up, a certain software to enable features of the input devices beyond moving and clicking is loaded. At that point I assume a hardware issue (flash storage on the motherboard is damaged) or firmware corruption in some sort.  Can somebody explain how exactly the signal processing on a MacBook works?  <comment359755> I am likewise suspicious of hardware solutions when it works in one environment and not another. I would be tempted to run a combo updater and if that doesn't do the trick install re-install macOS right over top of the current installation. It should preserve all your settings, files and apps but I *would* do a backup first, just in case. Failing that wipe the drive and re-install the OS.
