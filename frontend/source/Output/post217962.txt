How to correctly remove drivers of external USB wireless network adaptor? <body> I want to completely remove the driver of a TP-Link wireless network adaptor. I can't find any tips from TP-Link's official site. Is there a right way to safely and gracefully remove?  <answer217970> The default location for 'drivers' (although there's not really such a thing in OS X) installed by the user is code/Library/Extensions/code. I suggest looking in there for any .kext bundles which are related.  Unload the kext with codesudo kextunload /Library/Extensions/kextname.kext/code, move the kext out and reboot. If everything is ok, delete the kext. If the machine kernel panics, boot into single user mode with âŒ˜S and move the kext back.  <answer217973> I see from your comments to the posted answer of your other question (How to remove wireless network utility icon from the menu bar?) you have a TL-WN822N V3 and both the Utility package and the Driver package come with an codeUninstall.command/code to run to remove what's installed.  That would be the proper way to uninstall it.  <answer251472> Very simple  you will find file: (Uninstall) in the package folder just open it and put ur password then it will remove the app. for sure after restart your mac as well
