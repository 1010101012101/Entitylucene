How get email account settings from my Macbook Air onto my iPhone 5s? <body> I need to get the email account settings from my Macbook Air on to my iPhone 5s.  It was working perfectly until I got a new iPhone 5s. I backed everything up, but my email account for work is not working now, meaning I am out of the loop if I am not near my Mac.  <answer192787> On your 5s, go to Settings  Mail, Contacts, Calendars. Tap the email account, and make sure the Mail slider is on.  If the email account does not appear there, you have two options:  Add it using the email and password. More info can be found here: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201320 https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201855  Or, provide additional info on the type of email account you're trying to use on both your Mac and iOS device for further troubleshooting, eg is it a POP, IMAP or Exchange account?

I thought my mac would hold the password for the account as I could not remember and it had not transferred with the rest of the data. I have resolved the issue with a keychain visual of my password on my mac. thanks Beatby
