Restrict certain apps from using Wi-Fi (internet) on iOS 8 <body> I have iPhone 5c running latest iOS 8 update.  I know how to restrict certain apps from accessing internet when using cellular data.  I want to know if its possible to do same when Wi-Fi is turned on.  strongQuestion: Is there any way to restrict certain apps from using Wi-Fi on iOS 8?/strong  Addition to my question above: I want to restrict messenger apps like WhatsApp and Line from accessing internet when my phone is using Wi-Fi connection? (I know its possible to do above when I am using cellular data).  <answer201637> On stock ( or as some people call it strongvanilla/strong ) iOS it is not quite possible.  However, if your device is jailbroken, then you can use some tweaks to make it possible. strongFirewall iP7/strong allows you to monitor all applications &amp; decide whether to allow or deny any outgoing connection.  <answer216756> I'm sorry for it's not possible but you can disabled the app from running. These are the steps to follow:  Go to strongGeneral/strong,  Click on strongRestrictions/strong,  Enter your device strongpassword/strong,  Switch of the strongApp/strong you want to disconnect.  I use it to stop Facebook from consuming Data at the background.  <comment254935> Sorry to say but my device is not jailbroken. Thanks anyways. <comment310050> Just for the sake of completeness, the "Protect my Privacy" app from Cydia can also do this. As can a new tweak, "ConditionalWiFi".
