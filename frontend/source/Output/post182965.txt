Set Default App For Everything That Doesn't Have A Default <body> Is it possible to set a default open application if none is found on the system. For example if I have a code.mp3/code file, still let that open with iTunes but if i've got a random unknown code.abcdefg/code file make it automatically open with the application text edit?  To be clear, I want to set the default open application to text edit but only if a proper default isn't found or even just be able to set the text edit application to always show up in the 'open with' menu:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Telbbm.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment218129> I don't think it's possible. <comment218145> Unless the machine has previously seen the `.abcdef` extension it can't be told what to do with it [other than by adding every possible extension, one at a time]. Default - & sensible - behaviour is 'ask'.
