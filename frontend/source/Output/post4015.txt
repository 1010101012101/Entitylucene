What speed does the A4 in the iPhone 4 run at? <body> Apple made a big deal about the iPad's A4 running at 1GHz, but they've never said how fast the iPhone 4's processor is. In the teardown, iFixit mentions that the iPhone 4 uses an A4 but never gives a clock speed. Has anyone been able to find out how fast it actually is?  <answer4016> Though it's not confirmed, most sources claim that the A4 in the iPhone 4 is the same processor that runs the iPad, clocking in at 1ghz as you suggested.  <answer4026> According to MacRumors and some German source the iPhone 4 is somewhat slower than the iPad, but still significantly faster than the iPhone 3GS. I guess that its A4 CPU is clocked at about 750 - 850 MHz.  <answer4046> The iPhone 4 is based on the same processor that is seen in the iPad and has a clock speed of 1Ghz.  The iPhone 4 also has 512mb of RAM which is double that of the 3GS and although never officially announced also double that of the iPad.  <comment3839> its the same processor, but its not clocked at 1GHz like the iPad. <comment3840> +1. Also, it actually has more RAM than the iPad too. (512 vs 256) <comment3859> -1. It's clearly not 1 GHz (see the benchmarks). Apple has a tradition of underclocking the iPhone's CPU since the very first generation.
