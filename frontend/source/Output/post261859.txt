Is it possible to connect the new DELL 31.5-inch monitor (UP3216Q) at 3840x2160 to the new macbook pro (late 2016)? <body> I don't know exactly how to match the MacBook Pro 2016 specs to this display to see if it would connect at the native resolution (full pixels) of the dell display.  https://www.amazon.com/Dell-UltraSharp-UP3216Q-Screen-Monitor/dp/B016IBVKNU  Where can I learn how to qualify a display with MacBook Pro 2016?  <answer261860> Yes, it is possible, as the display supports DisplayPort 1.2 which is sufficient to drive 4K resolution at 60 Hz. Many vendors will sell appropriate adapters, though. I recommend you get a USB-C (or Thunderbolt 3) to DisplayPort adapter, like this one. You could also use Apple's USB-C to HDMI adapter, but that one only supports 30Hz at 4K resolutions.  The Dell has these ports:  ul liDP, mDP, HDMI (MHL), 4 x USB3 with one charging port, 1 x USB3 upstream, Media Card Reader/li /ul  Apple has a very nice article covering all the implications of USB-C and Thunderbolt including links to what displays they know work at 60 Hz and 4k resolution. You will want to read that carefully as well.  ul lihttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207256/li /ul
