Open Preference Pane from command line on El Capitan (Mac OS X 10.11) <body> I'm trying to open Preference Pane from command. However, when I invoke codeopen /System/Library/PreferencePanes/Dock.prefPane/code as in  How do you access network preferences from the Terminal?, I get Finder that contains the preference pane opened instead.   What might be a way to open the preference pane? I also tried code/System/Library/PreferencePanes/Dock.prefPane/Contents/MacOS/Dock/code to invoke the binary to have this error message.  code-bash: /System/Library/PreferencePanes/Dock.prefPane/Contents/MacOS/Dock: cannot execute binary file/code  <answer227004> The first command should open System Preferences-Dock. However, if it fails try the following command instead:  precodeopen -b com.apple.systempreferences /System/Library/PreferencePanes/Dock.prefPane /code/pre  code-b bundle_indentifier/code specifies the bundle identifier for the application to use when opening the file.  <answer227024> You can open System Preferences using its URL scheme:  precodeopen "x-apple.systempreferences:" /code/pre  You can jump to a specific anchor on a specific pane using:  precodeopen "x-apple.systempreferences:com.apple.preference.keyboard?Text" /code/pre  You can get the list of panes and anchors using AppleScript:  precodetell application "System Preferences"     set myIds to the id of every pane     set myAnchors to anchors of current pane end tell  /code/pre  <answer255708> I found using applescript solves this problem easily. (Using AppleScript to click radio buttons)  Make this applescript code and put it into code$home/Library/Scripts/Preference Pane/code directory.   precodetell application "System Preferences"     set the current pane to pane id "com.apple.preference.dock"     activate end tell  tell application "System Events"     click radio button "Left" of radio group 1 of window "Dock" of process "System Preferences" end tell  tell application "System Events"     click radio button "Bottom" of radio group 1 of window "Dock" of process "System Preferences" end tell  tell application "System Preferences"     quit end tell /code/pre  Then from the applescript menu, click the dock to reset the location.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3Yqks.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment275787> It doesn't work with my mac (El-Capitan). <comment275790> It doesn't work with my mac (El-Capitan). <comment275793> @prosseek Hmm both (your first and my command) work for me in El Capitan. Pierre's first command opens System prefs. His second command doesn't work. I didn't try the 3rd one. <comment275895> Looks like a bug to me. It works for some panes and not for others. E.g. open "x-apple.systempreferences:com.apple.preference.universalaccess?SpeakableItems" works on El Capitan. <comment315523> Opening the Keyboard pane using the above URL scheme still fails under the latest version of El Capitan. The following script however works:  `tell application "System Preferences"  set the current pane to pane id "com.apple.preference.keyboard"  activate end tell` <comment349217> Per [this](http://stackoverflow.com/a/24703872/647002), "Apple has restricted use of the URL scheme in 10.11", which is why it won't go to a specific pane any more.
