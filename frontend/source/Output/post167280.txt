Transfer Notes from iCloud <body> I originally created an Apple ID for use on the App Store in iTunes. When Apple introduced iCloud my Apple ID ended up being used.  I recently creating a new iCloud ID for my personal use, retaining the original for Family Purchases.  I just realised that I have lost all my Notes, although these are still on the web in the original iCloud account.  Is there any way I can transfer these to my new iCloud ID? I would prefer a direct transfer if possible, or export data. At the worst I could copy one by one, but this would be tedious.  <answer167289> Transferring notes from one Apple-ID to another is quite difficult on iOS, because when you logout from one account all the notes in iCloud disappear locally, dissimilar to the contacts. so I recommend you to do this job on your Mac, it's so easy. I assume your notes sync with iCloud on your OS X machine.  ol liOpen note app, login your original iCloud ID if you haven't and wait for all the notes sync completely/li liClick the "Notes"-"add account" menu to add another iCloud account (you can only check to select "notes" service)/li liClick "View"-"Show Folders list" if the folders is hidden/li liSelect oringal account from the folder on the left side/li liChoose the notes you want transfer by kbd⌘/kbd or kbd⇧/kbd Click, you can choose "Edit"-"Select All" as well/li liDrag all your selected notes to the new account on the left folder/li liWait for the sync to complete and check the result on the iCloud web site./li /ol  <answer263828> It doesn't work with new Notes Update (2016) there are some new features that won't be moved :(  <answer280583> Just completed doing this. I had set up a new Apple ID, and all my notes remained under my old ID.  After discussing with Apple, we concluded that the best way in which to do this is to open the Notes app on my iMac and then copy/paste into it each note stored under my old ID.  <comment196133> I've edited your question to focus on the Notes transfer. If you want help with the account creation problem, please ask a new question for this.
