Energy impact from terminal <body> Is there a command available that displays the Energy Impact from the terminal? codeTop/code doesn't display this info.  <answer150623> emTop/em will do it. However, this is not documented in the man page.  Example:     top -stats pid,command,power -o power -l 0   And of course you can grep the process of your choice  hr  You can also use the empowermetrics/em command to get some general info.  See documentation via man or here  A nice example can be found here     powermetrics -i 1000 --poweravg 1 | grep 'Average cumulatively decayed power score' -A 20   <comment177252> You mean other the the Activity Monitor.app ?
