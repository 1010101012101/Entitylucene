Exploring the files in a MobileSync backup <body> I'm trying to find if some movies that I had on my iPhone 5 might be hidden away in a MobileSync backup.  The weird part is that iTunes → Preferences → Devices doesn't show a backup for this device in February, but there's a folder in the MobileSync backup folder that shows a Feb 10, 2013 last modified date.  What I'd like to do is find out what all is in that folder without having to restore a device. Honestly, I'm not sure how to do the restore anyway, since there's no entry in iTunes for it.  Is there any way to browse what is in each backup?  <answer106024> Here's the DIY method:  Navigate to the following directory:  ~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/  You'll get a cryptic list of folders.  Inside each folder will be a large number of files with cryptic names.  Open these files in Quicktime Player.    There may be thousands of them but if you sort by size you should get video, audio and photos to float to the top.  Alternatively you could try one of the applications that is meant to do this such as iPhone Backup Extractor (There is a free and a paid version I have not tried either myself).  <answer106025> h2iExplorer/h2  iExplorer will let you browse iTunes backups.  ol liOpen iExplorer and click the strongBrowse iTunes Backups/strong button.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0jqCc.png" width="500"/li liYour most recent backup should be shown.
