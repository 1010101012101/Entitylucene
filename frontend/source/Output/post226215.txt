How can I hide the Resent-from header in Mail? <body> Looking at Apple's Mail: Show detailed message headers, it sounds like I shouldn't be seeing codeResent-from/code headers, because I have the View-Show message headers preference set to "Default."  The support page sounds like I should need to use Custom to ever see Resent-from.  How can I turn off the codeResent-from/code header?  I also tried setting the preference to Custom... without adding any headers at all, and nothing changed.  My Mac is running OS X 10.10.5, Yosemite.  <answer271212> Visit https://support.apple.com/kb/PH19118?locale=en_US The following reads:  When you view messages, you can show more fields in the message header, such as List-ID or Resent-From. Show the headers: Choose Mail  Preferences, click Viewing, then select “Show additional message headers.”  Change the headers that are shown: Click Select Headers. To delete a field, select it, then click Remove . To add a field, click Add , then enter a field name.  <comment340953> That's the same support document I noted.  I don't have "Show additional message headers" under Viewing, but I can choose Show message headers: Default/Custom...  Whether i choose Default, or choose Custom with no headers at all selected in the popup, the Resent-from header is displayed.
