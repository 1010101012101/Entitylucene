Prioritise file transfers <body> Lately I've been transferring quite a lot worth of files from one hard drive to another to another. There are some transfers that I need done immediately, but I do not know how to prioritise these transfers.  Is there a way to prioritise file transfers? Example: I have two hard drives moving data to another, can I prioritise one hard drive transferring files over the other? I could technically transfer them one at a time, but this process will probably take a long time, so I want it to go automated.  I need to be able to prioritise them after they have started (i.e. in Finder). Would prefer something a native solution over an app.
