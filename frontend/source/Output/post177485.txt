Cant add or get flash player preference pane <body> I can't add or get the Flash Player preference pane. I have been trying for days and if someone could just go to codeMacintosh HD/Library/PreferencePanes/code and copy the Flash Player.prefpane and put it in a link to download I would be so happy.  <comment209955> Please give us some additional information so we can help. What model of Macintosh? What version of OS X is the Mac running? Have you downloaded the latest version of [Flash Player](https://get3.adobe.com/flashplayer/update/osx/)?
