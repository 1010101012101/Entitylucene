Switching network location under Mavericks without password <body> When using Lion I could issue this command at the terminal to change network locations(which I got from this site, thank you):   precodenetworksetup -switchtolocation "Proxy" /code/pre  I've recently upgraded to Mavericks, and I find that although the command works, it suddenly requires my user password:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/243i1.png" alt="enter image description here"  (Yes, that is my name, no I have no problem with it being here...)  I thought that this might be something to do with the new privacy settings, but Terminal is already down as being allowed to control the computer.    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UQYAJ.png" alt="enter image description here"  So my question is - how can I switch between network locations smoothly and without being interupted by my password?   <comment189260> `networksetup` doesn't need any access to your `Accessibility` preferences. It needs an access to priviledged mode. This can be obtained through 2 methods: interactively asking your password or by using your keychain. I didn't find if `networksetup` is able to use our keychain.
