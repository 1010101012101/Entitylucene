Using rsyncd with the system users rather than a separate rsyncd userlist? <body> Is it possible to use rsyncd with the system users rather than a separate user list (something like how SSH works)? How? All tutorials I have read specifies a separate user list. Any good reason to not do it?  <comment108722> Are you asking if you can have a shared database of accounts for your computer? <comment108756> Yes I guess that is one way to put it. Compare how ssh works. If I create a new "GUI-user" that user can automatically also login via ssh.
