How are Mailbox folder paths related to Keychain? <body> Mail (OS 10.11.6) suddenly stopped seeing all my local email folders ("On My Mac"), and I believe this may have been related to resetting the default Keychain ?  The files were all still on the disk, so I was able to reimport the missing mailboxes, and I noticed they were given a new path (a cryptic 32 character alphanumeric code--different from the previous one that Mail stopped recognizing).  Does anyone know how those mailbox paths are generated, and is it expected that resetting Keychains can break local mailbox access ?  It's a bit of work to re-import all those mailboxes, so I'd like to avoid having to do it again in the future.  Thanks for any advice!  -James
