Moving files in Yosmite doesn't move all the files <body> I am having the weirdest problem since upgrading to OSX Yosemite.   If I select a bunch (hundreds) of files and try to move them to a different folder, only a few (under 100, like 86) of the files move. The rest are still left selected in the original folder.   I could not find anyone else experiencing this problem.   Anyone know what is going on?  <comment199429> Any other information? Do the folders reside on the same disk? How large are the files? what sort of files, etc.? <comment199461> Any file, same hard drive. Just tried it with 500 jpg photos. Only 86 move at a time. <comment199542> Did you check the permissions on remaining files? <comment199720> Yes, Read & Write. <comment220175> How much free space is remaining on your file systems? <comment220176> Try copying with the terminal, using cp or rsync and see if it still happens <comment220185> Check the file permissions, if they are not correct, open terminal type "sudo su -"       Then type your password and type "chmod -R 770 (file-directory-goes-here)"
