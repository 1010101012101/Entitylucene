Thunderbolt Display with 2015 retina book pro <body> I recently purchased a "new" 2015 13" retina MacBook Pro.  Without checking compatibility I grabbed up a Thunderbolt Display from the internet thinking I had a great setup!  To my amazement the 2015 retina mbook is just about the only model in recent history that doesn't support Thunderbolt Display!  Is it possible with adapters and/or cables or any other means or am I out of luck?  <comment339407> You mean you have a USB-C Macbook, correct? <comment339520> Your question is completely incorrect. All you need to connect a 2015 MBP to a Thunderbolt Display is a single thunderbolt cable!
