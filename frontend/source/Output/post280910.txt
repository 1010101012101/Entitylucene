Is it possible to have multiple calendars in the menu bar? <body> It's possible to change the menu bar calendar entirely in Language &amp; Region in System Preferences. Is there a way to have two different calendars in the menu bar, similar to how it's possible to do so on iOS on the lock screen and in notification center?  Ideally I would like something that uses native settings only, without third-party apps.
