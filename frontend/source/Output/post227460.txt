How to make Safari auto-fill both username and password, rather than just the username? <body> In some cases Safari decides to fill the stored login/password for you, other times just the login. I thought once that it depends on whether there are multiple login/password pairs stored for a given website or just one, but after some experiments it appears not to be the case.  For example, I have multiple iCloud accounts. Previously, Safari used to fill only the most frequently used one, so that I could only click the login button and proceed. Now, I think after the upgrade, on some web sites it fills only the email part. I removed all the other stored iCloud accounts from my Keychain and left only one, but still Safari doesn't fill the password for me, despite that the "key" drop down menu shows only one choice.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/K4dLW.png" alt="enter image description here"  Strangely, iCloud.com does fill both fields, whereas iTunes Connect doesn't, though it used to previously.  I find this a bit annoying, let alone unpredictable. Is there a way to force Safari to be - well, more predictable?
