Keyboard shortcut to switch screens on split view <body> I want to know if there is any keyboard shortcut to switch between splits screen in all new El Capitan.   <answer212601> I really hope someone has a better answer, but if not, kbdCommand/kbd+kbdTab/kbd works if the two last apps you've touched are the two apps being splitscreened.  <answer280614> Go to System Preferences  Keyboard  Shortcuts  Keyboard  Click the code^f4/code and type your prefered shortcut. (I set mine to codecontrol tab/code)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vkfcJ.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment256705> Cmd+tab won't work. That lists all the running apps. Switching turns hard with that. <comment256706> @androidplusios.design It lists all the running apps if you hold it down. If you press it and quickly release it, it just switches between the two most recent apps. <comment256707> And may be the recent apps aren't on same split screen. <comment256708> I know. That's why I said "if the two last apps you've touched are the two apps being splitscreened." <comment256709> I don't have a designated keyboard shortcut for switching between the two apps on my screen. I'm just telling you my workaround so you can use it while I join you in waiting for someone with a better answer to show up.
