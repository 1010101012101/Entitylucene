Hide Applications from other Spaces in Application Switcher <body> With System Preferences-Mission Control-"When switching to an application, switch to a Space with open windows for the application" disabled, I would really like the application switcher (cmd+tab) to hide applications from other spaces.  Is this possible in Mavericks or is there a third-party application that provides this? Note, I would prefer the application switcher to remain as it is, just hide the applications only active on other spaces.  <answer123924> Windowflow - free for a limited time and gives some options for different spaces and such.  Witch - 12,99 € and has an option that will only show apps in the current space.  WindowSwitcher - 3,59 € and it comes very close to your needs, check it out.  As far as an native solution to your problem: I don't think there is a setting or command that makes the application switcher behave like this.  Definitely check out WindowSwitcher I honestly think it is what you are looking for!  p.s. prices were correct at the time of posting.  <comment144765> So to understand you clear - On a certain Space You will make Cmd + Tab Act like a Rotator over the Apps open only on this screen? Is that what you are looking for? If so thats also what i am looking for. Haven't found something usefull yet. <comment144785> I was about to recommend **Witch**, but a quick check reveals that it doesn't *seem* to have that functionality... <comment144788> @Alex are you speaking from experience? because on the fourth screenshot on the store page there is a checbox visible saying "list windows from all spaces" <comment144790> @dennismuys Oh, you are totally right! Yes, I did check Witch's preferences, but I completely missed that option! Sorry... Well, in that case, Witch works for the OP. <comment144791> haha no problem, it is easy to miss <comment145139> @mtsr is this what you are looking for? Or am I looking in the wrong direction? <comment145850> Thanks for the answer. I would still be interested in a native solution, but it doesn't seem to be available at the time.
