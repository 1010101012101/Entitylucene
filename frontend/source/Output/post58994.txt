What is the format I should write the command to SSH into Linux VPS? <body> I am trying to use SSH and log in from the terminal into a Linux VPS.  I have tried a few variations around the following:  precodessh [user]@[hostname].[my.ip.address.xx]:22 /code/pre  and keep getting:  precodessh: Could not resolve hostname [hostname].[ip address]:[port]: nodename nor servname provided, or not known /code/pre  I have verified that my VPS works fine logging in from Windows with Putty, so I am sure I have something mixed up.  What is the format I should write this SSH command in?  <answer58995> Use a hostname, or IP address. Not both.  The hostname will only work if there is a resolvable DNS entry.br The IP address should always work as long as you use a publicly routed or otherwise reachable one.br You don't have to specify port 22, it is the assumed default when otherwise unspecified.  <answer59044> If you want to use both hostname and ip adress use code-W/code argument to set the host (codessh ip -W host:port/code)  <comment67978> wow, do I feel like an idiot; aka thanks. (marking as answer in 8 minutes) <comment67979> Is the VPS hosted? Or do you run the VPS yourself? <comment67980> hosted, but answer below worked. I was trying to append the port, hostname, and username (since the error message suggest I needed to), but ssh [my ip] worked like a charm.
