How can I permanently modify OS X's green window button? <body> I've been trying to find a way to strongpermanently/strong modify the behaviour of the green window button in OS X 10.11, El Capitan.  I want to left click the green button and have the window strongnot/strong go into strongfull screen/strong. Done ideally through Terminal.  Acceptable: Option-Click to enter "Full Screen"  I am aware of the following approaches but these do not do what I want:  ul liOption Click/li liany app that provides a stronghotkey/strong or strongdrag/strong options/li liSpectacle/li liBetterTouchTool/li liDouble Click Title Bar/li lisaying something like "There's no way."/li /ul  None of these answers my question.  Please reread my goal. No other answers are relevant. Please excuse my anger, but I continue to run into posts and questions like this that people continue to talk about Option-Click, Spectacle, BetterTouchTool, the "Double-click a window's title bar to zoom" preference option, and many options.  <answer232895> The behaviour you want to achieve is not trivially possible on OS X. The behaviour requires modifications to the underlying window management framework.  Individual application developers may be able to achieve this behaviour but this would go counter to Apple's Human Interface Guidelines. Going against these guidelines might risk the application being rejected from the Mac App Store.  h1Tell Apple/h1  Send Apple your feedback and let them know what you want and, most importantly, why you want this behaviour.  <comment284651> Please consider rewording or rephrasing your question. Aggressive and demanding questions tend to attract negative responses and may be ignored by those who might otherwise be able to help.
