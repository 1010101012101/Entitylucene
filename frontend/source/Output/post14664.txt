Pause screen recording in QuickTime X <body> I found a screen recording feature of QuickTime X very useful. Except you can't pause the recording, as in most other screen recording programs. Or can you?  <answer14672> There are two options you can exercise, and they both involve post processing.  You could either stop the recording in lieu of a pause, and start a new one, then splice them together in post; or, keep recording, and manually trim/cut out the middle aspects you wished to pause through.  If audio accompanies these recordings, I suggest using an audible cue that you've reached a pausing point. Anything sharp such as a clap is a great marker to remind you down the road where exactly to trim the fat.  <answer70195> ol lirecord as usual/li liwhen ready to pause, strongmove your mouse over to the recording box and click anywhere to activate that box (the Quicktime Program)/strong/li lipress "option button" on keyboard and the record bar will change to Pause ||/li liBUT, this DOES NOT PAUSE the timer, to do that,click the Pause ||/li liNow, it's truly PAUSED and you can let go of the "option" button/li liNow, the record button turns RED, when in this mode, it's PAUSED/li liTo restart recording, simply click the RED button/li liDo steps 2 to 7 all over again for another pause in your recording/li /ol  <answer264200> there is vwery good answer here worked for me on Sierra.

After reading all these answers and posts, my conclusion is the following:  The fastest way to pause a recording (including screen recording) is:  While recording press kbdEsc/kbd to show recording bar.  Then press kbdOption/kbdkbdSpace/kbd to pause/unpause.  <comment81503> Are you sure about this? Doesn't seem to work in Mountain Lion. Besides you then still have to edit out the mouse movements to/from the QT window so I don't see a benefit to recording individual segments. <comment110493> I tried this with success on Mountain Lion. @patrix, you need to make sure that you focus on the quicktime window (click on it) before option button will have any effect. <comment110494> but I wish there was a keyboard shortcut for pause/resume <comment244717> This only worked for me if I during step 2 clicked Qucktime and then pressed ESC to bring up the recording box. Without the ESC there is no recording box on newer versions.
