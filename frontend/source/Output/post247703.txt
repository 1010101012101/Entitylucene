My iPhone 5s is crossed with my son's phone <body> I had trouble getting my son's iPhone 5s to show up on my Find my iPhone.  We finally got that working, but all of his contacts were on my phone and mine were gone.  We had to totally delete all contacts and start over, but now, my phone thinks it is two phone numbers.  It shows my number as "This device" and his number as "This device".  When I try to text him, I text myself, and he doesn't get any of them.  I can call him and he can call me, however.  I really don't want to mess up the Find my iPhone because it was such a pain to get it working in the first place.  <comment305663> Does your son have his own AppleID? Have you set up Family Sharing?
