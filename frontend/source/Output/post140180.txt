Black Screen Failure, requires forced reset restart Macbook Pro 15" <body> I'm getting the Black Screen more &amp; more often.  I didn't have it a few months ago &amp; then it started once in a while in a week, now it happens a few times a day, everyday!    My machine is a Macbook Pro 15" from mid 2010 &amp; Apple quarries on the Internet tell me that I can't get it fixed by Apple.  What's going on?  <answer140190> It seems that you are getting black screen when opening a GPU heavy app or Flash. I am sure that this is a GPU failure. You will also have difficulty at startup later. Try one thing. Download a software called gfxCardStatus. Install it and set the GPU to Intel only. Do not play any games or use Flash. You should be okay.  <comment165212> If you provide us with the Console log at the Time stamp of the event (some 30 lines) we might be able to do something. Console is in your Utility folder. <comment165257> I'll try to do this, but I'm not nearly a knowledgable user at the Utility level. <comment165259> I don't use any games or, as far as I know, heavy GPU or flash apps.  However, I have been thinking it occurs more with iPhoto open or opening.    I'll try gfxCardStatus later today, thanks so much, appreciate your responsiveness. <comment165271> How do you set to Intel only?  By disabling switching to save energy?  Thanks. <comment165364> @GogogoStopSTOP Click the app in the menu bar. Select Integrated only and make this app load at startup.
