Network share randomly returns after ejecting it <body> I have OS X Yosemite installed on a Macbook Pro Mid-2012.  I have a media share folder I connect to from time to time that is hosted by a Windows 7 machine.  When I'm not using this share on the Macbook Pro, I eject it.  I don't normally keep the share around because I frequently get Finder issues (extremely long delays opening folders) with the share after I wake from sleep.  At any rate, I'm noticing that the media share reappears on the desktop without me manually connecting to it via command-k.  I'm curious as to why this is happening.  My only thought is I have iTunes on the Macbook pointing to the iTunes Library on this media share folder and some background iTunes process is connecting to the share to do something?
