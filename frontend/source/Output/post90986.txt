Clearing user input - New Remote Connection Window MAC OSX <body> I was using Terminal.app to to use the ssh command and I opened the "New Remote Connection" window. There is this long text box under the "user" box that displays the ssh ... commands that were entered. How do I clear my input? It just displays all of my server names that were entered? The delete doesn't seem to work?  <answer91007> You can clear the emNew Remote Connection/em history (which is shown in the dropbox that you mentioned) by typing the following in an active Terminal window:   precodedefaults write com.apple.Terminal PreviousCommands '()' /code/pre  Then, quit and restart Terminal and the history should be empty.  <comment106905> Thanks for getting back, but it isn't working. I still see the server names. I exactly followed what you said. <comment106906> I apologize! It is working fine. Thanks so much!! :-)
