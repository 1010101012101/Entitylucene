How to "Ctrl-F" in iPhone's Safari browser? <body> Most browsers have a "search" or "find" function (accessible through kbdCtrl/kbdkbdF/kbd) which allows us to search the webpage for text.  Does iPhone's Safari browser have this functionality?  <answer55299> I don't have an iPhone anymore, but my memory tells me this:  h1iPhone/h1  Search using the standard search bar.  ul liThe strongweb search/strong suggestions are at the top./li liThe strongwebsite search/strong results of the currently viewed website are at the bottom./li /ul  h1iPad/h1  Search using the standard search bar.  ul liThe strongweb search/strong suggestions are at the top./li liTo search the website use the entry box which pops up right above the keyboard./li /ul  All of this may change with iOS 6 and Mountain Lion. The WWDC2012 announced that Safari for OSX will integrate a Chrome like omnisearch bar . Most likely we'll see something similar for iOS as well - at least i hope so :).  <comment63493> What do you mean by the "standard search bar"? I can only see the "address bar" and the "google search bar".. <comment63494> @Pacerier Sorry that I wasn't clear enough. I mean what you refer to as the "google searchbar" - which actually is not the real name as you can change it to Bing or Yahoo for example. <comment63495> Cool its working =) Wow, talk about bad usability..
