Opt+arrow cursor manipulation stopped working <body> Part of my regular repertoire of keyboard shortcuts is kbdOpt/kbd+codearrow/code and kbdShift/kbd+kbdOpt/kbd+codearrow/code for moving (and selecting) a word at a time in apps like Word, TextEdit, etc.  A couple days ago kbdOpt/kbd+codearrow/code stopped working in most places (though not all). I figured a reboot would clear it out but it did not. The only place I can find that it works right now, strangely enough, is a textbox on a website in Chrome. So I can use it this dialog I'm typing in right now, but not the URL field of the browser.  Any idea how to fix and/or reset this behavior? I'm lost without it.  <answer143635> I found the answer.   Even though it wasn't selected, I did have installed "Unicode Hex Input" as an Input Soure (along side U.S) in the Keyboard-Input Sources preference pane. I removed the Unicode option altogether, and the opt-arrow shortcut started working again instantly.  <answer151396> This helped me find the solution for OS X 10.6/Snow Leopard, which is a little different. The strongInput Sources/strong tab is under strongSystem Preferences-Language &amp; Text/strong, instead of strongKeyboard/strong. I had strongUnicode Hex Input/strong installed and enabled; unchecking it fixed the Option-Arrow problem, and emre-checking it again/em doesn't seem to bring the problem back! Very strange. I'll probably leave it unchecked just in case.  Edit: More details. It looks like the actual problem has to do with the strongKeyboard &amp; Character Viewer/strong item in the menu bar. (This appears as a national flag when nation-specific input is selected, or a yellow-on-purple "U+" when Unicode Hex Input is selected.) When strongUnicode Hex Input/strong is selected in the Keyboard &amp; Character Viewer, the Option-Arrow keys don't work in some apps. You can leave Unicode installed and enabled in strongLanguage &amp; Text-Input Sources/strong, but it can't be selected in the Keyboard &amp; Character Viewer.
