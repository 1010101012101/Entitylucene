Can I send Notification Center items to my iPhone using Pushover or Prowl? <body> The title pretty much sums it up. I often feel like having notifications on my iPhone are a lot easier to notice, especially if you step away from the computer for a few moments to do something and come back.  Ideally I would like an AppleScript or something similar that forwards my Notification Center items to my iPhone using Pushover or Prowl (ideally Pushover).  Anyone have any experience with this?  <answer67125> An extensive search has determined the following:  There are a number of ways to SEND notifications TO Notification Center in Mountain Lion.  There are currently no hook in AppleScript to read notifications FROM Notification Center. This would be a key starting point in piping such notifications to Pushover or Prowl.  Conclusion: As of OS X 10.8.2 - no. Sorry. :(  Good luck and happy notifying!  <answer261011> I'm using EventScripts to do similar (Hazel triggers Applescript). See example here: http://www.mousedown.net/mouseware/Event_Scripting.html EventScripts is a cheap app that's available on the Mac App Store.  It doesn't need one of EventScripts 'events' just something to run the AppleScript and Tell EventScript to notify via PushOver.
