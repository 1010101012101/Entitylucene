Apache 2.4 display forbidden at projects after upgrade to OS X El Capitan <body> I'm having a 403 Forbidden message in my projects that contain a .htaccess file, this happened after upgrade to OS X 10.11 El Capitan.  I have no idea why, I've been looking for an answer and I've tried everything but I don't get fixing this.  My version of Apache is 2.4, can you help me with this please? I've had this problem since 4 days.  Thanks.
