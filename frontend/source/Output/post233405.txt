How to Install PIL in El Capitan with Pip? <body> I would like to install PIL by Pip but the code is unsuccessful  precodepip install PIL Collecting PIL   Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement PIL (from versions: ) No matching distribution found for PIL /code/pre  I know the outdated thread here about emHow can I install PIL on mac os x 10.7.2 Lion/em, and my versions should be ok, since they are most updated. My Pip and Python versions in OS X 10.11.4 El Capitan  precodepip --version pip 8.1.1 from /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages (python 2.7) /code/pre  My pip is installed by codesudo python get-pip.py/code of the mother site.  I have the newest xcode installed  precodegcc --version Configured with: --prefix=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr --with-gxx-include-dir=/usr/include/c++/4.2.1 Apple LLVM version 7.3.0 (clang-703.0.29) Target: x86_64-apple-darwin15.4.0 Thread model: posix InstalledDir: /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin /code/pre  hr  How can you install Pil in OS X 10.11.4?  <answer241930> This is because PIL is not setuptools compatible (https://mail.python.org/pipermail/image-sig/2010-August/006480.html) and has as such probably never been installable through pip. I think in general it should be considered deprecated in favor of Pillow which is an actively developed compatible fork of PIL.  So what you want to do is codepip install Pillow/code, and also consider different pip usage since El Capitan like described in another thread here.  <comment297372> Great! Thank you for your answer!
