Export Documents and Data from iPad <body> When I plug in my iPad to iTunes 12 on Windows, it shows Documents and Data occupies about 8 GB. I would like to export all these documents to my computer so I can delete them from Ipad.  I clicked on the Apps Section in iTunes and tried the File Sharing section. But it does not show all the documents. How do I go transferring them?  Thanks.  <answer275556> My recommendation would be to check what's taking up your data. To do this:  ol liOn your iPad go to Settings/li liTap on General/li liTap on Storage and iCloud Usage/li liUnder the Storage options tap on Manage Storage/li liWait a little while for strongall/strong the apps to be populated/li liOnce it stops updating, your apps will be listed in order of what's taking up most of the space/li liTap on the apps in the list to view more details about what's taking up space/li /ol  By following the above process you'll get a much better idea of what's taking up space and will be able to take steps to manage that.  <comment346353> Can you expand on what you mean by _But it does not show all the documents_? Do you mean that _x_ app is listed and is only showing _y_ number of documents when it should actually be _z_ number of documents? Or do you mean it's not listing all the apps that have data? Something else? Also, what version of iOS are you running on the iPad? <comment346582> Ohk,by that I meant it showed me documents in notably etc apps for a mere few mbs so I don't understand what's occupying the 8 GB of document. IOS on iPad upgraded to latest I believe is ios 9
