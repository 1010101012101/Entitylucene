I can't boot my iMac to Mac OS X <body> I have Windows (Boot Camp) installed. So I ran out of storage and thought about partitioning my Mac's part of drive. I partitioned my Mac's drive and set Windows to boot by default. Once I lost electricity and my iMac shut down. After this accident I can't see Mac in list of devices to boot. (After pressing alt when Mac is turning on) But all files are ok. I see them when I use Windows. Well, Boot Camp Control Panel indicates my Mac-George as Windows:br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Juprq.png" alt=""  <comment264090> I don't even know what that screenshot is of, but can you please explain how you repartitioned your drive, and if you can get back into OS X. <comment264108> Have you tried booting into recovery? <comment264210> The first thing you should to is backup all your files.
