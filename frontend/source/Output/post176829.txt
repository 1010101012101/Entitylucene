Synced music not showing on iPod <body> I download some music on my iPod that I have on my computer. I created a playlist and download about 25 songs through iTunes and it took all of the music. Suddenly my iPod shows no list and no music. On my desktop I can see all music I tried to load in iTunes but not on my iPod.  PS I tried to sync and no changes  <comment208906> How does your situation differ from the one described in http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/161551/very-suddenly-only-purchased-music-is-showing-up-on-iphone-but-everything-is? Do you have iTunes Match enabled? By "it took all of the music", do you mean the sync didn't throw an error or you were able to play the tracks on your iPod?
