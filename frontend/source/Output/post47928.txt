Compile VLC on Lion <body> I am trying to compile VLC on my Mac along with guide on wiki. I am getting the   precode*** /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.6.sdk does not exist, please install required SDK, or use export OSX_VERSION=10.6 *** /code/pre  error, but I don't have a /Developer directory. Brew works fine and other compiling, too.  Am I somehow able to specify I want to build on 10.7 framework? I need to compile VLC for translating.  <answer47930> To specify you want to build on 10.7, use  precode$ export OSX_VERSION=10.7 /code/pre  If you don't have a code/Developer/code directory you probably have the new version of Xcode which installs itself directly into code/Applications/code.  In that case the equivalent of the code/Developer/code directory would be code/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/code, so look for a way to tell that to the build script.  <comment54921> Specifying the version is contained in the guide i liked. I would actually know concrete steps to get it work ;) <comment54923> @Mailo: That guide says that to compile you run `$ ../extras/package/macosx/build.sh`. So just look what that does, and make it look in `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer` (or wherever your `Developer` directory is). Alternatively, just create a symlink at `/Developer` pointing to wherever your actual `Developer` directory is.
