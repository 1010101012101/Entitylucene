Keyboard shortcut for prev/next sheet in Numbers 3 <body> Is there a keyboard shortcut for moving to the next or previous sheet in Numbers 3? I have a dream I found those shortcuts, but can't seem to figure out what they were...  <answer126149> preferences - keyboard - shortcuts  There you can find all existing shortcuts. If you do not find it, you can create it by yourself.   <answer126209> This feature has been added in Numbers 3.2, released 2014-04-01.  Numbers now honors the ⌘-{ and ⌘-} keystrokes for previous and next sheet, respectively.  Additionally, the menu items are now under the Window menu to be remapped.  Numbers 3.0 and 3.1 did not have this feature.  <comment147702> there is some information here http://support.apple.com/kb/PH14849 <comment147774> Yes, but not the information I'm looking for. <comment147775> The existing shortcuts are not there, and I cannot add shortcuts for items that are not in the application menus. <comment147817> Good timing! :)
