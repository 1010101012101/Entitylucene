Is there a way to disable thumbnails in Messages notifications? <body> In OS X, is there some way I could disable thumbnails in Messages notifications? That is, if someone sends me a text messages or iMessage with an image, the thumbnail of the image shows up in the notification on OS X, even though "show message preview" is unchecked in System Preferences  Notifications.   This is pretty annoying. If I don't want anyone seeing the text preview of messages on my screen, I certainly don't want them seeing the thumbnail of an image one of my ridiculous friends sent. (think, NSFW)  It doesn't look like there's a way to do this natively in OS X.  I know that I could turn off notifications altogether and just see the badge app icon in the dock, but I'd like to know who messaged me without switching into the application. I'd really just like that thumbnail to be hidden.  Thanks!
