Please help me with iPhone updating problems I've been having <body> My iPhone 4 is at iOS 7. I try to update it but it says the phone is up to date. How do I change that? I want the newest iOS version.  <answer221496> The iPhone 4 is incompatible with version of iOS above iOS 7.1.2.  The reason you are not seeing updates available is because future iOS versions are incompatible.  <comment268185> [See this Answer.](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/174061/what-is-the-latest-ios-version-for-iphone-4)  iOS 7 is the highest version the hardware of iPhone 4 supports. <comment268186> The iPhone 4 is not a supported device of the latest iOS, currently 9.0.2.
