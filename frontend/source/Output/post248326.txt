Changed my Apple ID and now I can't send messages from my Macbook <body> I changed my Apple ID and everything is good, FaceTime works on my iPhone and Macbook. However, when I go to send a message on my Macbook, it says offline. Also, when I go to send a message, it doesn't deliver and the person who I'm trying to send to's name is red. I used to be able to send SMS messages as well, but now I can't send iMessage or SMS messages.
