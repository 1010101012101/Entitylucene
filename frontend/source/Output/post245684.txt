Are numpad numbers from an external numpad recognized as different keys? <body> I have extensively been using Photoshop and want to improve my workflow. I have a Wacom tablet, which works great, but now the numpad on the keyboard, which I use for a number of things, is far from reach and on the wrong side.   I want to buy an external numpad, more precisely this one (which is probably very good judging by the 227 ratings and 4.5 stars on Amazon). However, there is one thing which will change to what extent I can create custom shortcuts, which is if the number keys on the external keypad are recognized as different keys to the normal number keys of the Apple keyboard. Will this be the case?  Regards.  <comment302958> [Possible duplicate of this question](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/230639/os-x-will-a-bluetooth-numpad-keypad-support-unique-keyboard-shortcuts) (unanswered).
