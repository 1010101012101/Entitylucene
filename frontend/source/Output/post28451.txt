How do I find the current Mission Control space number from the command line? <body> Is there any way to determine the number of the currently active Mission Control space/desktop in Mac OS X Lion from the command line?  <answer33392> I found this post on the main SO site.. Seems simple enough (er not really)..  Hope this helps.  <comment32730> Just curious. Why do you need to know the number of the current Mission Control desktop? <comment32805> I have a load of desktop wallpapers, some good, some bad. With the old Spaces I had an automator workflow tied to a button that would find the name of the current wallpaper and trash the file if I pressed the button. That way I could delete pictures I no longer liked. With Mission Control, the only way I can see of doing this is by first knowing the number of the space I am viewing. If you can come up with an alternative method of finding and trashing the picture currently being viewed, then I am all ears. <comment32849> I will have to think about it. That's pretty complicated, and pretty cool too! <comment32936> The names of the spaces wallpapers are in com.apple.desktop, but I have no idea how to work out which one is for which space other than grepping for the names in this file and looking at the images. As I run 6 spaces and have thousands of images, it would be nice to be able to trash one I don't like if it pops up on the current space I am using. <comment33220> I guess I will have to get my workflow to ask me which space I am in. That's probably the easiest solution in the absence of a key-value property that is easy to interrogate.
