What is the difference between -h, -r, -s, and -k, in the "shutdown now" command in single-user mode? <body> So, I opened up single-user mode to show my friend how easy it was for a Mac to be directly hijacked if someone was able to steal the physical lap top (as opposed to hijacking remotely using SSH), and I couldn't exactly remember which codeshutdown now/code emoption/em to use (fortunately, I was prompted by the command line), so I defaulted to code-h/code. Should I be worried if I use code-h/code instead of code-r/code? Is there any difference between these commands?  precodeshutdown -h now shutdown -s now shutdown -r now shutdown -k now /code/pre  <answer226354> As stated in the shutdown manual page (codeman shutdown/codeentered in a Terminal window):  precode -h      The system is halted at the specified time.   -k      Kick everybody off.  The -k option does not actually halt the          system, but leaves the system multi-user with logins disabled          (for all but super-user).   -r      The system is rebooted at the specified time.   -s      The system is put to sleep at the specified time. /code/pre  So to shutdown the Mac the code-h/code option is the proper one. code-r/code restarts it and code-s/code puts it to sleep. The code-k/code option doesn't halt your system at all.  <answer226355> Not much happens in single user mode - so I just just use a simpler command:  precodehalt /code/pre  The codeshutdown/code command is for sequencing a lot of the scaffolding that is erected to have the system processes start in a certain order, then user processes. Even with codelaunchd/code simplifying much on OS X, all of this is relevant to full blown OS X - notice to allow programs to save work, close files, check point logs so that the next start has less work to do.   strongemNone of that matters in single user mode/em/strong as halt flushes the IO and takes down the power to the hardware.  <comment274866> What in shutdown's manual page do you find unclear? <comment328143> Okay, good to know. Thanks!
