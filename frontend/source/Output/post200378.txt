Advanced gmail settings missing on iPad? <body> I'm trying to make some changes to my gmail account on my iPad. All recommendations ask me to go into Settings, select mt gmail account, then select "Advanced"  which I don't emhave/em as an option...br What am I missing?  <answer200421> The route is Settings  Mail, Contacts, Calendars  [Name of your Gmail account]  On the first row of this screen it says Gmail and just below that, "Account"; to the right is the name of your account and an arrow.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fz2xy.jpg" alt="mail app, gmail settings"  Tap on the arrow. The "Account" screen is opened.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BXbCr.jpg" alt="mail app, gmail Account screen"  On the bottom row there is an "Advanced" button, tap on it.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AHMoA.jpg" alt="mail app, Gmail settings, advanced"  <comment241448> Could you provide links to some of the recommendations that you're talking about. <comment241829> Thank you!
