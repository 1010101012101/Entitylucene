How to prevent the Mail app from restoring its previous state? <body> The Mail app on my iPhone 5s crashes while launching. I assume that it is trying to restore its last state. Unfortunately that last state was what originally crashed it. So restoring that state results in a Mail app that will always crash on start up. What can I do to prevent the Mail app from restoring its last state on start up?  I already tried the following:  ul lidisabling all Mail accounts/li lisend myself a mail to launch the Mail app from lock-screen/li liclosing the Mail app/li lirebooting the phone/li licontacted Apple support - only to find out that restoring an old backup is the only thing they know will help/li /ul  I do not want to restore from a backup, because it is probably not possible to restore the Mail app backup only.  <answer187318> If I have just an app crashing I usually do a double-tap on the home button and swipe the misbehaving app strongup/strong to "remove it from memory." This (I believe...) forces the iPhone to launch the app in it's default, rather than previous, state. And usually fixes app crashing issues.  <answer187699> I finally fixed the issue without data loss. Here is what I did:  ol liCreated a backup from the iPhone while the Mail app was still broken/li liRun codeRestore iPhone.../code within iTunes (I tried codeRestore Backup.../code which did not fix the issue)/li liAfter the iPhone was reset to its factory defaults I set it up using the backup I did in 1./li /ol  <comment221238> try holding down both the home button and the power button. This will do a full reboot. Then try opening Mail.app <comment221239> @TheBro21 thanks for the comment but I missed to mention that I already already tried to reboot the phone without success. <comment221240> Ok. That is the only thing I can think of. Another thing you. could try is do something in the Mail.app settings. Or sync, or restore <comment221341> Isn't this what "closing the ... app" means? The OP has also mentioned in comments that they've rebooted the phone, which should also have the same result; shouldn't it? <comment221391> I am not sure if rebooting the phone will also remove the saved state or not, not something I have never checked. One would **think** that it would clear that but since it is such a quick thing to try I thought I would post it on the off chance it has the desired effect.
