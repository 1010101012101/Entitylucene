MBP major virus I think <body> I am sure I have got some virus(s) in my Mac book &amp; I have no idea what to do about it. I download torrents on a regular basis. When I am in Safari, every time I click a link of any kind a new, extra tab opens that has nothing to do with what I have clicked. Usually it opens to mackepper or similar type "junk sale" web site.  Help!  <answer147387> My advice is to check for both malware/viruses and adware:  For malware, grab ClamXav from:  http://www.clamxav.com/  For adware, grab AdwareMedic from:  http://www.adwaremedic.com/  <answer147401> This sounds like you're experiencing MacKeeper and similar website ads.  What worked for me is a Safari extension called iAdBlock Plus/i.  Click this text to install AdBlock Plus for Safari.  <comment173742> Please provide screenshots, and did you reset your Safari settings already? If not, try it first. <comment173745> Every time you click a link? or just when you're on one of those sites? What does this link do? http://www.microsoft.com <comment173746> I don't see why it should be unclear what he's asking. It might be a good idea to refurbish it a bit, but looks legit though. <comment173749> i think this is more malware than virus, check your safari for plugins, extensions, home pages, used search engines and 'information bars'. and don't install mackeeper, it's malware in person.
