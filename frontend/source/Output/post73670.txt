how to find out the submenu item's name in this special case (for a shortcut) <body> In TextEdit there is this submenu (see the image) that I want to define a shortcut for.  I can't define a shortcut for the "Right to Left" item, I assume it's because there are actually 2 such items in the submenu, under different sections. So how do I uniquely identify this item? Thanks.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/124Bz.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer73674> The indented menu items start with tabs, but there are still two of them.  codetell application "System Events" to tell process "TextEdit" to name of menu items of menu 1 of menu item "Writing Direction" of menu 1 of menu item "Text" of menu "Format" of menu bar 1/code  You can specify some shortcuts like codeFormat-&gt;Indentation-&gt;Increase/code in 10.8 (or code&gt;Format&gt;Indentation&gt;Increase/code in 10.7), but it doesn't help in this case.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bYRgE.png" alt=""  You can enable shortcuts for changing writing direction in System Preferences:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/R3907.png" alt=""  <comment85579> thanks, this solves the problem by a different approach. I didn't get the highlighted part of your answer, could you elaborate? I'm using 1.6.8. <comment85582> You can run it in AppleScript Editor to see the names of the menu items. <comment85594> cool, thanks. the reply is `{"Paragraph", " Default", " Left to Right", " Right to Left", missing value, "Selection", " Default", " Left to Right", " Right to Left"}` though, so the problem still exists
