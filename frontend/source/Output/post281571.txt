Flux vs Night Shift? <body> New MacOS sierra 10.12.4 introduced us new feature called strongNight Shift/strong .   Is it better to stick with strongemflux software/em/strong https://justgetflux.com/ or just use strongemNight Shift/em/strong?  Pros and cons of using these softwares for adapting display colours on late nights?  Edit: There is interesting article about this on iMore site: http://www.imore.com/night-shift-vs-flux-whats-difference  <answer281572> At the end of the day (ho-ho!) it probably just comes down to which effect you prefer, as the science is somewhat inconclusive anyway. Night Shift's effect is more subtle even when turned all the way up, but it's rather less configurable than Flux.   The article you linked to basically already covers all this, and the relative merits of each:  Flux:  ul liBigger variety of colour-shifting effects available/li liMore control over start/end time/li liCan be permanently turned off for specific apps, e.g. video players or photo editors where you don't necessarily want colour-shifting to occur/li liCan be temporarily turned off for all apps/li liIt's nice to support a 3rd-party developer/li /ul  Night Shift:  ul liBetter system integration; potentially easier on battery as a result (just a guess: I've not measured this, nor heard any anecdotal evidence either way)/li /ul
