Default color profile lost (MacBook Pro 2015) <body> I have a MacBook Pro 2015 early (MJLT2), and days ago, I carelessly deleted my default profile, now the screen looks a little grey...  My question is if the profile different from device to device? If not, could some one help to upload your profile? And should I check the screen manufacturer is Samsung or LG?  btw, the profile file should be in this folder:  precode$  ls /Library/ColorSync/Profiles/Displays/ /code/pre  with code.icc/code extension.  <comment335389> Try restarting your computer. This can sometimes restore the default color profile.
