Mail Quits unexpectedly every time it opens <body> I have a serious problem with the Mail application. It just won't open. I've seen some 'remedies' for example, resetting rules and settings, but this can't be done if the app doesn't even open.   precodeProcess:               Mail [7832] Path:                  /Applications/Mail.app/Contents/MacOS/Mail Identifier:            com.apple.mail Version:               9.2 (3112) Build Info:            Mail-3112000000000000~7 Code Type:             X86-64 (Native) Parent Process:        ???

Mail is a reasonably important part of doing business  (Full error log here).     This is different from Mail.app crashes constantly, even after deleting mail profile and cache,   because users are able to open   the app to commence remediation activities there. As stated, I had tried   this but each time the the app opens it crashes immediately. The   resolution in the other thread is not possible to implement in this   case.   <comment284247> Do you have any sorts of third-party plugins installed? <comment284250> no plugins installed <comment284870> There are two mail applications that come with OS X, you should state explicitly which one you are having problems with. <comment348322> Don't know whether I should ask a different question or just hope for an answer to this one.  Mine fails to launch starting yesterday, and does not leave a crash report.  Bounces once in the Dock and that's it. Well, never mind.  After more than a dozen tries in 24 hours, it is mysteriously fixed.  If it's what I suspect, I will be back to post that info!
