There is an issue with the time in my macbook air <body> My laptop displays the time correctly in the menu bar, but when it records an activity, like the creation of a file, a sent message in iMessage, a reminder, it always shows the time as 7pm with whatever minutes are accurate. So if I send an iMessage at 3:22pm it would appear as sent at 7:22pm. And if I make a folder at 10:00am it appears as created at 7:00pm.This is driving me crazy. How can I solve this?  <answer76228> Have you tried resetting the PRAM?      Shut down your Mac. Locate the following keys on the keyboard: Command   (âŒ˜), Option, P, and R. You will need to hold these keys down   simultaneously in step 4. Turn on the computer. Press and hold the   Command-Option-P-R keys before the gray screen appears. Hold the keys   down until the computer restarts and you hear the startup sound for   the second time. Release the keys.   If this doesn't help, your PRAM battery may need to be replaced. Not a huge deal.
