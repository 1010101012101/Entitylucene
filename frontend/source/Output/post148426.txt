Drag-to-select text frequently grabs entire line or paragraph <body> Using 10.9.2 at the moment, but I'm pretty sure I've had been noticing this problem for a while. I'm also using a Razer Orochi, in wired mode, in case this might somehow matter.   Sometimes when dragging to select text I cannot select only a few letters or words; I can visibly do so, but upon release of the mouse the selection automatically extends to either the entire paragraph or entire line (it varies). It seems to happen primarily in web-based contexts, but happens also in PDF's, and with less confidence (I'm drawing from memory) any formatted text (ie. even Pages 09).   Obviously this owes to the selection extending to hidden format characters, but, why does this happen, what causes it and how, if possible, do I fix it? I find it maddening. The pop-up window for creating a drafting a new tweet on the Twitter site proper is the most ubiquitous case; I can select partial strings using the keyboard (ie. shift + arrows) but when the same selection is attempted with the mouse the selection extends both backward and forward to include more text, delimited by lines, sentences (seriously, sentences) or paragraphs.   Anyone else have this problem or know what to do about it? Drives me batshit sometimes.  :/
