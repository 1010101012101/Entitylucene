Lost apachectl bin file <body> How can I recover the apachectl on my OSX?  I deleted it, somehow, and now the command apachectl doesn't exist anymore.  <answer83415> If you build Apache httpd from the source code, you can get the codeapachectl/code binary from code&lt;apache_src_dir&gt;/support/apachectl/code.  <answer83454> On 10.8 apachectl is a ~50 SLOC shell script. I uploaded the one from my installation here. For example codeapachectl start/code just runs (sudo) codelaunchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.apache.httpd.plist/code, so you don't necessarily even need apachectl.  <comment92912> Do you... have any backups? use Time Machine? have the 10.8 install media? <comment92928> `/usr/sbin` isn't in your PATH usually. What does `ls -l /usr/sbin/apachectl` return? <comment92942> @jscott I have a Macbook Pro, there is no install media, and no, I don't use Time Machine, at least until it happened. <comment92943> @patrix returns `ls: /usr/sbin/apachectl: No such file or directory` <comment92953> @patrix In lieu of [building apache from Apple's source](http://www.opensource.apple.com/source/apache/apache-780/), it may be quicker to find another 10.8 user and get a copy from them. <comment92970> Will installing the OSX combo update restore any files installed by Apple? Currently 10.8.2 is [here](http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1581) <comment96021> Welcome to Ask Different! Can you please elaborate the answer to explain how one can rebuild apache from source?
