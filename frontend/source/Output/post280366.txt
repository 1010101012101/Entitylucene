Delete a sound in Apple Clips <body> I just downloaded ï£¿ Clips, and I discovered that I could add some music in the background that you can download:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LJx5T.png" alt="Clips" But I would like to know if there is a way of deleting these background music without deleting the app. P.S. : I already tried to swipe to see if there is the delete button, and there isn't .
