OSX cmd+tab behavior with multiple windows & monitors <body> After upgrading to a second monitor I have run into some unexpected codecmd+tab/code behavior that is really impacting my workflow:  With one monitor, when using codecmd+tab/code to switch between applications, OS X gives the focus to the last active window of the application one switches to. With multiple monitors, OS X prefers windows that are on the same monitor as the previous application.  To give an example:  ul liConsider having Xcode on monitor 1 and Terminal (window A) on monitor 2 and (window B) on monitor 2; focus is on Terminal window B/li liyou codecmd+tab/code to Xcode/li liyou codecmd+tab/code back to Terminal, but now window A has the focus and not window B/li /ul  This behavior is potentially hazardous as one starts to enter commands into Terminal before realizing that the focus is on the wrong window.  My question is: Is there a way to make codecmd+tab/code always return to the last active window of an application no matter on which screen the focus at the moment?  <answer202116> System prefs  Mission Control... uncheck 'Displays have separate Spaces'br That would be my prime suspect. I switched that one off the day it appeared in the OS.  From comments, that will disable the ability to move the menu bar &amp; dock to each screen on an ad-hoc basis, though - which may be best asked as a separate question requesting a possible 3rd party solution, as I know of no way to do that natively.  <answer287948> In Sierra(not sure about older OSX versions) it is possible to temporary lock the cmd+tab menu in specific display. Dock  Finder icon  Right Click  Options  Desktop on Display[n] where [n] is number of desired display.  <comment243645> system prefs  Mission Control... do you have 'Displays have separate Spaces' checked? That would be my prime suspect. I switched that one off the day it appeared in the OS. <comment243742> Thank you, that solved the problem already partially. Now, there is the new question of how do I get to retain the menubar on the second screen (and possibly the dock, but that is not so important)? <comment243743> ahh - as far as I know, that's not possible. Menu & Dock stays where it is, on the primary screen. For me, that's not an issue, in fact my muscle memory prefers it that way & I'm a key-command kind of user anyway. Maybe there's some 3rd party solution? I'd be tempted to raise it as a new question. <comment243756> Ok, I'll add it as a new question. Can I somehow accept your above answer as you only commented and did not answer the question in the stack exchange sense. <comment243757> I'll have to throw it into an answer - even though it's only really a partial 'fix' <comment264283> Having separate spaces for my monitors was a great help for my workflow, not in the least because I could have a fullscreen program on one monitor and still use my other monitor for other things (with the Displays have separate Spaces option unchecked, going into fullscreen on one monitor makes the other one go black). I'd appreciate any fix that allowed me to keep my separate spaces...
