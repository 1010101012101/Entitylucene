Is it safe to backup only the Photos.app library, and not the older iPhotos? <body> strongQuestion:/strong Is it safe to take a backup of just the newer Photos.app library, or may it have some crazy dependencies into the older iPhotos library?  strongBackground:/strong On my 479 GB HDD,br 348 GB is used by "iPhoto Library.migratedphotolibrary" andbr 356 GB is used by "Photos Library.photoslibrary".  That's 146 % of the total capacity, which confused me until I saw this post about hard linking. Before I discovered this I tried to take a backup of both libraries (using codersync -var/code) onto a disk that should have enough capacity, but then rsync reported that the target disk wasn't big enough anyway. Assumedly rsync duplicates the files. So, can I safely skip backing up the older iPhoto library?  <comment274648> As a follow up, I ended up not backing up the older iPhoto library, and so far I haven't discovered any pitfalls.
