"IOSurface seed changed" warnings in console <body> In Console.app, in the System logging section, I'm seeing messages like this, at a rate of roughly one per second:     19:09:38 kernel: Warning: IOSurface 00000236 seed changed while owned by an accelerator 00000003: 00000304 - 00000146   What is this, and can I make it stop?  It's making it almost impossible to read anything else in the log.  <answer110432> From the Apple Developer Reference, IOSurface is an API being called that allow applications to move complex image decompression and draw logic into a separate process to enhance security.   Apps that share media utilize this API, such as Messages or QuickTime.  I've read that this issue can arise when using a VPN, but I can't seem to corroborate that at the moment.  <comment130146> I do use Screen Sharing to access another machine sometimes, but I get these messages even when it isn't running. <comment130147> The obvious question is: if it is caused by an app doing something funny with a kernel call, is there a way to figure out what app made this kernel call? <comment142536> possible it is happen by a malicious made quartz composer plugin. had this kind of feedback in console everytime i made misstakes while programming a plugin there. specially when working with video input from facetime camera.
