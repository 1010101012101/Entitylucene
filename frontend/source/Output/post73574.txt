Can I use the same Time Machine drive with OS X 10.5 and 10.8? <body> I have an external 500 GB hard drive that I used to use for Time Machine backups with my PowerBook G4 running OS X 10.5 (Leopard). However, I now use it with a white MacBook running 10.8 (Mountain Lion). The PowerBook backups are still on the drive (each machine gets its own directory by default), but I have not backed up the PowerBook since I started using the drive with the MacBook.  My question is, is it safe to do a backup of the PowerBook again? Does Time Machine in Mountain Lion do anything differently to the drive that would make it not work correctly with Leopard, or vice versa?  I ask because the PowerBook is finally failing (occasionally boots directly to a kernel panic) so I'd like to do one last backup before it bites the dust.  <answer73576> Yes - whether you have a USB or other direct drive or a network drive, Time Machine will cooperate with different Mac backing up to the same destination.   The only problem would be if you enabled FileVault on a direct attached drive since only Lion and later can read those.   <comment85508> I know I can backup two machines to the same drive; I'm more concerned with the fact that one is running 10.5 and the other 10.8. Sounds like it will be fine though (I don't use FileVault). <comment85509> It will be fine. Inside the Backups.backupdb folder each machine will get it's own sub folder for all the backups relating to that machine.
