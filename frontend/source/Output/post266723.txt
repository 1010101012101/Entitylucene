Enable Google Location History on iPhone <body> I would like to enable Google's Location History on my iPhone, so I can see my location history through https://www.google.com/maps/timeline.  I tried enabling this functionality as follows: Open the Google app - Menu - My Account - Personal Info &amp; Privacy- Activity Controls - Location History. Here my iPhone is listed, with a disabled checkbox. When I click on the checkbox to enable it, nothing happens.  I have Settings-Privacy- Location Services enabled, and Settings-Privacy- Location Services-Google set to 'Always'.  Is there any way to enable the Location History functionality?  <answer269020> I found the answer myself. For some reason, enabling the device through the Google app did not work, however the same screen in Google Maps works fine.   Open the Google Maps app  Menu  Settings  Location history  Enable the device.  <comment334469> Do you have Background App Refresh turned on for Google?  See [this Google help page](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/4388034?hl=en&ref_topic=7189122) and be sure to follow all directions. <comment334488> Are you using a personal Google account, or one provided to you through work or school? <comment334490> Backgtound App Refresh is enabled, both in general and for Google. <comment334493> I'm using a personal Google account, however one registered through Google Apps on a personal domain that I own. <comment335370> Nobody any idea?
