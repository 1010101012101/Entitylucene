iPhone tethering not working via bluetooth <body> I can successfully tether my Mac (10.7.3) to my iPhone4 (5.0.1) via wifi, no problem, been doing it for months.  However, when I try to tether via bluetooth instead, I can't seem to see the internet from my mac.  Network Settings reports a green light for Bluetooth PAN, but my browser can't connect to anything at all.  My Mac reports very similar IP addresses for both, starting with 172.20.10 and differing only in the last octet.  Any idea why I can't successfully tether via bluetooth?  <answer48621> This fixes what i presume to be a corrupt internet sharing preference file. It will also remove all other network settings such as wifi access-points and their passwords so keep that in mind. Other data such as pictures and contacts will be completely safe.  ol liOn your iPhone, go to codeSettings -&gt; General -&gt; Reset/code and choose codeReset Network Settings/code. /li liThe iPhone will ask you to confirm and then restart./li liIn codeSettings -&gt; Internet Sharing/code reenable it and choose to turn on bluetooth if a dialog asking to do so appears./li liReconnect to your wifi-network if applicable./li listrongYou're probably done/strong, try connecting.

Magically it worked with nothing further required.  <answer249984> In addition to the 13 steps above, having the personal hotspot on on my iPhone 4s, worked for me.  <answer281220> A self-assigned IP may be another problem when using Bluetooth PAN with internet sharing. One way to get around that is to manually assign an IP to the PAN with the same subnet and router as the primary wi-fi network.   <comment46486> Have you tried disabling the other network connections (on the mac) one by one in the network preference pane? It could be as simple at the default route not being set properly or needing to set the bluetooth PAN connection to be a higher preference than whatever other network connections are available. <comment46488> is the tether activated via cydia tweak ? <comment46526> no jailbreaking involved, using real pay-out-the-nose at&t tethering.  No other network connections are green in the network control panel, wifi is turned off and I'm not plugged in to anything. <comment59335> Fantastic!  Lifesaver.  The first five steps didn't work for me, but all 13 did.
