Is it possible to have 2 iCloud email accounts in IOS 5? <body> Under a Mobile Me Family Pack, I set up a secondary email account for myself, giving me two "username@me.com" addresses. When I transitioned to iCloud, I used my primary Mobile Me account, which I set up on my Mac and iPad. In June of 2012, Mobile Me will cease to exist, but I still need to use that second account. Is it possible to have both my primary iCloud email, and that secondary account on my iPad? (On my Mac, i just set up another User Account, and used it to "migrate" that second Mobile Me account to iCloud.) I would Only need to sync Mail to my iPad for the latter, so would not be concerned with duplicating Adress Book contacts, Calendar etc.  <answer41529> iCloud has a feature called "iCloud mail aliases" which allows users to create up to three so-called alias emails. Each of these is a completely separate email address which forwards email to you and lets you send email from it. Unfortunately, there's no way to have two separate emaccounts/em in iCloud, but this may prove useful to you anyway.  To set up a new alias, go to https://www.icloud.com/#mail and open Preferences, accessed via the gear icon in the top right. Under the Accounts tab, click "Add an alias…" and fill out the desired settings.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/McnRa.png" alt="Accounts pane" The Accounts pane in iCloud Mail  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VRB7W.png" alt="Mail alias creation"br Creating an alias  <answer41540> It sounds like you've already discovered that you can migrate each MobileMe Family Member sub-account individually to iCloud. Having done that, you can now add the second account to your iPad as a secondary iCloud account by going to codeSettings &gt; Mail, Contacts, Calendars &gt; Add Account… &gt; iCloud/code.  You can also add secondary iCloud accounts in OS X by going to codeSystem Preferences &gt; Mail, Contacts &amp; Calendars &gt; Add Account… &gt; iCloud/code. This way you don't have to switch users in OS X to access the second iCloud account's mail.  You can migrate remaining MobileMe Family Members by going to me.com/move, instead of having to create a new user in OS X to do the migration.  Primary iCloud accounts can use a few features that secondary accounts can't:  ul liiOS 5: Photo Stream, Documents &amp; Data, and Backup/li liOS X Lion: Bookmarks, Photo Stream, Find My Mac, and iCloud Storage/li /ul  <comment47105> You are correct about aliases but it *is* possible to have multiple iCloud accounts and you can access the mail for those multiple accounts on a single iOS device or computer–which is what the OP wants to do. <comment47107> Thank you so much for the information! <comment47225> @jaberg Oh, I hadn't thought it was... thanks for the clarification.
