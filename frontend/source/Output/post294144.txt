Is there a file to reference for Finder favorites? <body> Recently I did an update from Yosemite to Sierra and I realized my favorites were removed and the update defaulted to the typical Finder favorites left from the window.  I didn't see a definitive answer under the tag finder or from any of the questions after searching Finder favorites.   So my question is, can I parse a file under operating system that I can add back after the update to preserve my favorites without having to take a screenshot and add them back?    Knowing this would be helpful because I could script it when I update my other machines and if I wanted to replicate my environment.
