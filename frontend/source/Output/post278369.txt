How can I diagnose a Mac running hot and having high fan usage? <body> My Mac is running hot with the fan cutting in often. How can I diagnose what's wrong?  PS: Some sources mentioned Activity Monitor as a tool to diagnose this, but I couldn't find the application.  <answer278375> As IconDaemon mentioned in their comment, Activity Monitor is by default located in Macintosh HD  Applications  Utilities.  However, since your question seems to really be about your Mac emrunning hot with the fan cutting in often/em, and since you say you're emnot proficient with Mac OS - any pointers welcomed/em, I thought I'd suggest you try starting in Safe Mode and potentially also resetting the System Management Controller (SMC).  strongBoot into Safe Mode/strong  As a troubleshooting step you can boot your Mac into Safe Mode to see if your issue persists, both during Safe Mode and afterwards when booted normally again. Follow these steps to boot your Mac into Safe Mode:  ol liFully shut down your Mac/li liRestart your Mac/li liImmediately press the kbdShift/kbd key and strongkeep it down/strong /li liLet go of the kbdShift/kbd key when you see the login window (NOTE: If you have FileVault enabled you may need to log in twice)./li liTake a note of what happens (i.e. is your Mac still running hot, etc)/li liNow exit Safe Mode to restart your Mac as normal/li liAgain, take a note of what happens (i.e. is your Mac still running hot, etc)/li /ol  Once you've booted into Safe Mode, let me know how you went. However, if the issue persists (especially if it persisted during Safe Mode) you can reset the SMC to see if that resolves the issue.  strongReset the SMC/strong  Your computer's System Management Controller (SMC) is responsible for a wide range of functions, including your Mac's cooling fans, power management, battery performance, and the list goes on. The instructions for resetting your SMC depend on whether your device runs  ul lifrom a built-in battery?/li lia removable battery? /li lioff AC power (i.e. plugged into a power point)?/li /ul  Since you don't actually specify your model of Mac, I will provide the steps for all three scenarios.

This will give you an indication of the typical temperature ranges experienced by users of various intel Macs.

See [this Apple support page](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201464) for help if you need it. <comment350290> Activity Monitor is found in Macintosh HD  Applications  Utilities. <comment350419> A good answer but not to this question - your answer deals with if there is a problem with the fan but the question is how do I find **if** there is a problem and most likely it is software <comment350499> Yes, my answer doesn't fit so much now that the question was edited. :) Originally there were two: (1) finding Activity Monitor, and (2) the OP welcomed any pointers to resolve the issue as they aren't proficient with macOS. The original question didn't actually mention _diagnosing_ the problem. Regardless, resetting the SMC is useful both in terms of the fan and also high CPU usage (especially in instances where there is no apparent need for it). Regardless, I've just edited my answer to suggest they try booting into Safe Mode to see if the problems still persists. Thanks for the feedback. :)
