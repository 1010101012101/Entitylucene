Which free alternatives to Little Snitch can I use to block internet traffic per applications? <body> Little Snitch can block internet traffic of a particular app. Can I do something similar without (paying) Little Snitch, either by using free alternatives or configuring the OS X firewall directly?  <answer94295> h2TCPBlock/h2     TCPBlock is a lightweight and fast application firewall … you can prevent selected applications on your computer from opening connections to the network.   TCPBlock is free and can be downloaded from MacUpdate, however TCPBlock doesn't appear to work with El Capitan and is no longer being updated.  h2PF Firewall/h2  OS X emcomes with/em the PF firewall, which can be configured to block emall connections/em to emcertain servers/em in emall apps/em. Blocking all connections from a emsingle/em app is not possible as far as I am aware without external software.  You can use IceFloor as a GUI for the PF firewall.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EZciz.png" alt="IceFloor Black List"  <answer94297> I think you can through the firewall as stated in this article:     ol   liClick the strongSystem Preferences/strong icon in the Dock. /li   liClick the strongSecurity/strong icon. /li   liClick the strongFirewall/strong tab./li   liClick the strongStart/strong button to turn on your firewall./li   liClick the strongAdvanced/strong button./li   liClick the strongAutomatically Allow Signed Software to Receive Incoming Connections/strong radio button to select it./li   /ol      This enables the firewall. And, by default, virtually all incoming   TCP/IP traffic is blocked. You must enable each sharing method that   you want to be able to use. When you enable different sharing methods   from the Sharing pane in System Preferences (such as File Sharing or   FTP Access), you’ll notice that those types of traffic now appear in   the Firewall list. (In other words, when you turn on a sharing method,   the firewall automatically allows traffic for that sharing method,   which Snow Leopard calls a service.)      Click the up/down arrow icon to the right of any service to specify   whether the firewall should allow or block connections.      Sometimes, you might want to allow other traffic through your firewall   that isn’t on the firewall list of recognized services and   applications. At that point, you can click the Add button (which bears   a plus sign) to specify the application that your firewall should   allow. Snow Leopard presents you with the familiar Add dialog, and you   can choose the application that needs access.   <answer192743> TCPBlock still works in OS X Yosemite (although it doesn't seem to work on El Capitan). Install it, restart the machine, open System Preferences and select TCPBlock. Unlock the pane then select the plus icon then emSelect Applications/em and choose Adobe Photoshop.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EkPRT.png" alt="enter image description here"  (sorry about download.com link)  <answer196352> Use Radio Silence. Very simple application, but does the job nicely, however it costs $9.  <answer258244> If you know which server an application is trying to contact, and want to stop it from doing so, you can reroute all communication to a bogus IP address (like 0.0.0.0) or just reroute traffic to itself (the local host). You need administrator privileges (sudo) for this to work.  h1/etc/hosts/h1  code#/code is a reserved character for starting ignored text. All other lines are parsed in space-separated columns. To stop all connections to facebook:  precode# Col 1                 Col 2 # "routed to" address   hostname (dns)   0.0.0.0               www.facebook.com /code/pre  Usually the effects are immediate, (like right now I just tried to make sure and it was immediate), but you could unload and reload the multicast dynamic naming  service manually.  precodesudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.mDNSResponder.plist sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.mDNSResponder.plist /code/pre  emlaunchctl does not support coderestart/code like codesystemctl restart avahi-daemon/code:(. That is why you must run two commands./em  h2Example of default /etc/hosts file/h2  The name "localhost" works because it is routed here to the ip local host standard address of 127.0.0.1.  precode## # Host Database # # localhost is used to configure the loopback interface # when the system is booting.  Do not change this entry. ## 127.0.0.1   localhost 255.255.255.255 broadcasthost ::1             localhost /code/pre  <comment110591> It seems to me Firewall only blocks incoming traffic to an app but not outgoing traffic from an app. <comment110743> Yes, the default firewall in OS X (as edited in this way) only blocks incoming traffic. It does not block outgoing connections from apps on your computer. The default OS X *PF* firewall blocks both ways (see my answer). <comment110772> Little Snitch is **completely** worth the price. Buy it. You will thank me. <comment137924> Can you really block apps from IceFloor? <comment169347> I'm using IceFloor v2.0.2. Can you explain your answer a bit more on how to block a specific application from accessing internet? <comment185547> @grgarside: in IceFloor v2.0.2 there is no *Black list* tab anymore.. <comment197878> `tcpblock.wordpress.com is no longer available.` <comment232328> http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/35914/tcpblock new home of tcpblock? <comment234550> Welcome to Ask Different! Radio Silence appears not to be free. Also try linking people to what you are talking about... http://radiosilenceapp.com/ <comment262153> @barrycarter That's just a download hub, like CNet <comment262198> @DjangoReinhardt You are correct. TCPBlock itself is apparently homeless and no longer supported by the developer. <comment321070> +1. This is cheaper than little snitch so since there does in fact not seem to be a free alternative I think it is a a quite good attempt at the solution! (I had the same problem and went with this)
