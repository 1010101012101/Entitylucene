Deleted /etc/, can't boot from DVD <body> I accidentally deleted the files in code/etc//code (yes into /private/etc) and my iMac gets stuck on a blue screen after the initial apple logo now. I tried to boot from install DVD but it hangs at the apple logo when I do that.  Any suggestions on how to fix or reinstall the OS?  This is an iMac with OS X Snow Leopard.  <answer54110> My iMac would loose its boot sequence because I had it booting into Windows mode. What Apple told me to do was to hold down the kbdOption ⌥/kbd key while the machine was rebooting.   <answer54182> See Startup key combinations for Intel-based Macs (HT1533) for a list of available key combinations during startup.

In your case the volume to select is the OS X Snow Leopard DVD/li /ul  <comment62130> mentioned that i tried booting from DVD already, hangs at apple logo. The only non-regular mode I can boot into is single-user root mode.
