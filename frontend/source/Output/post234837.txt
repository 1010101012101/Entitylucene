What rules does OS X use for naming mounted volumes? <body> When I use VeraCrypt (a successor of TrueCrypt) to mount volumes on my filesystem, and I don't specify where it should mount them, the results are:  precode/Volumes/NO NAME /Volumes/NO NAME 1 /Volumes/NO NAME 2 /code/pre  ...and similar. I suspect these default paths don't come from VeraCrypt, but rather are set somewhere in OS X itself.  I ask because I'm trying to predict what other people's OS X installations will do, and I'm worried theirs are configured differently than mine. I'd like to be able to predict the mounted paths on other comps, and I'm getting reports of paths like:  precode/Volumes/Untitled /code/pre  But I can't reproduce this.  strongQuestions/strong  ol liCan anyone verify this is standard OS X behavior?/li liBy what rules does OS X decide where volumes are mounted on the filesystem, especially what are the defaults and how are they set?/li liIs this question related to the unix or BSD ancestry of OS X?/li /ol  strongEDIT/strong  I'm really trying to understand why and when different volume labels are used (the "NO NAME" or "Untitled" part).  <answer234838> ol liYes, this is standard OSX behavior. If you have two identically named volumes, OSX will suffix 2-N with a digit in the filesystem (however, I don't believe they appear differently named on the desktop)/li liOSX mounts everything under code/Volumes//code.

But it could have called it "UNNAMED" or "Unknown" or just given it a number.

I'd like to be able to predict the mounted paths on other comps. <comment287162> Some Googling reveals that these volumes from TrueCrypt and VeraCrypt always mount with the name "NO NAME" -- so it's not just your install. <comment287168> Great, but I don't see any details on the name of the volume once mounted. Where does "NO NAME" come from? Can it be configured a/o does it vary? <comment287170> @Chris, "NO NAME" is the volume label. <comment287172> Ok, so it's the volume label. I don't know what that is. Where does it come from? Why might it vary? <comment287174> @Chris, It can come from the actual volume label or the OS, it all depends on what's being mounted and how it was created and under what OS, how created and defaults vs choices made by the User when it was initially done.  As an example under Windows if one formatted a floppy diskette without providing a Label, then NO NAME was used by default and didn't appear in the GUI while being formatted but was reported from the command line. <comment287175> Not sure of the answer, but I usually see unnamed volumes mount as "NO NAME" when they are formatted as MS-DOS (FAT) and "Untitled" when they are formatted as HSS (or whatever format OS X Extended is).
