Make the menu bar in Yosemite opaque <body> In Mavericks and earlier, it was possible to make the menu bar opaque, rather than the default translucent look.  Now in Yosemite, it looks like translucency is the default, and the setting is gone from where it used to be, to toggle it.  Is there a workaround for this? Such as a way to do it through Terminal?  <answer150907> In System Preferences  Accessibility  Display, enable the "Reduce Transparency" option.  (Note, though, that that disables transparency across the whole system; it doesn't seem like it's possible to disable the transparency emjust/em for the menu bar anymore.)  <answer151470> In System Preferences  Accessibility  Display, enable the "Increase contrast" option.  <answer280775> Accessibility → Display → Reduce transparency:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JCFAo.png" alt="reduce transparency macos accessibility"  <comment177608> Okay so I guess they moved it. The transparency feels a bit bothersome to me anyway. But I'll give it a few days to get used to it first I suppose. <comment189435> Note that this option makes some text unreadable when you are in "Dark Mode" because it's rendered as black text on a dark grey background (e.g. the WiFi menu).  When not using "Dark Mode" though it's a good aid to readability.
