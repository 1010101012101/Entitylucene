sudo softwareupdate –background doesn’t give me the update "incompatible kernel extension" <body> I recently upgraded my mac to Sierra, and I cannot connect anymore to Ethernet using thunderbolt-ethernet adapter. Apparently the problem can be solved with an update of incompatible kernel extension configuration data 3.28.2 as you might find on many search queries, such as OS X update broke Ethernet . To update incompatible kernel the suggestion is to use codesudo softwareupdate --background/code or codesudo softwareupdate --background-critical/code and then rebooting. However, my problem is that software update does not give me any update of incompatible kernel extension configuration data, and the latest one installed on my computer is:  precodeIncompatible Kernel Extension Configuration Data:    Version:  2,13   Source:   Apple   Install Date: 11/12/2014, 00:52 /code/pre  When I get the list of software updates by codesudo softwareupdate -l/code there is no relevant update. Any idea why software updates does not give me update 3.28.2?
