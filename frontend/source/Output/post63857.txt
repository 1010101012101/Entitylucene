Launchctl:Dubious permissions on file: Problem Installing Jenkins <body> I'm trying to install Jenkins on 10.6.8 and part of this requires that modify the plist launch daemon.  org.jenkins-ci.plist   which is owned by root.  I was using admin and I gave admin permission to write this file. I used this permission to make the admin the jenkins user and set the home directory to be the admin user directory.  However now I cannot run the launch daemon.  precodelaunchctl: Dubious permissions on file (skipping) /code/pre  Now I realize this is due to a security issue with having given myself this permission.  The plist now has my admin user as the user for jenkins.  Should I now just remove the write privileges and all is good (admin can now be the jenkins user) or not?  Update: I did codesudo chown root org.jenkins-ci.plist/code and it still feels things are dubious.  <answer63863> If you're in /Library/LaunchDaemons, which I assume you are for a system daemon, and want the files to go back to default:  precodesudo chown root:wheel org.jenkins-ci.plist sudo chmod 644 org.jenkins-ci.plist /code/pre  The plist will register on reboot, or you can load it like this:  precodesudo launchctl load org.jenkins-ci.plist /code/pre  You can check the status like this:  precodesudo launchctl list &lt;&lt;Job Name&gt;&gt; /code/pre  Note that jobname is not the same as file name. Inside the plist you'll see a Label. That's the name:  precode    &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;DataScrub&lt;/string&gt; /code/pre  In my example the name is DataScrub, so would be:  precodesudo launchctl list DataScrub /code/pre  <comment73976> it worked! thanks.
