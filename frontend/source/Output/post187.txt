Is there a free, lightweight text editor that isn't text-only but also isn't a heavyweight IDE? <body> I'm not really satisfied with the text-editors available for Mac OS X.  I tried TextWrangler, Smultron, Coda, SubEthaEdit, TextMate and others I do not remember. But none of the above satisfied my needs.

By the way, which aspect of TextMate didn't appeal you?  <answer197> Have you tried any of the Eclipse variants? I'm not a huge Eclipse fan, but the Aptana version of Eclipse (which is geared primarily towards front-end web developers) seems to satisfy all of your requirements above and may be worth a peek.  http://aptana.com  <answer199> Have you considered Xcode?

Integrated support for an SCM is not something easily found. Perhaps you should use an external tool?     ul   liwhich supports a fast autocompletion/li   /ul   As far as I know, only a few major IDE's support this.   You're not going to find what you're looking for emfree/em. Any IDE will feel slow as mud compared to a text editor like TM or TW.   If you want my honest opinion, try TextMate. Bundles will allow you to replicate some of the behavior you're looking for, the rest you can hope is in 2.0.   <answer218> I think that Aquamacs might do the trick!  <answer224> I'm partial to Coda these days, but came across this the other day when I was looking for something else.  I haven't tried it, so not sure if it meets all your needs. It's free, but only because it's not being developed anymore.   http://www.web-scripter.com/  <answer254> I can't vouch for it personally, but RedCar looks pretty promising. It supports TextMate bundles and runs on Mac, Linux &amp; Windows. It doesn't support your entire feature list, I don't believe it has integrated source-control or project support (other than folders).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rzRxe.png" alt="RedCar OSX"  <answer309> Check out Fraise, the successor to Smultron.

It does every single thing you're asking for and more.  <answer458> You need Notepad++ running under wine! or winebottler!  <answer2574> What's wrong with BBEdit, other than you might have to pay for it?  <answer5102> One trend I noticed this year is Mac programmers and web developers moving away from Textmate and the like to MacVim, including Ryan Singer of 37signals, who rocked MacVim during his Future of Web Applications talk recently.  Lots of people have written about why they switched; "Coming Home to Vim" is my favorite.   <answer6673> You might try KomodoEdit.

You might find "Home-baked SVN support for Komodo Edit" to be interesting.     ul   liwhich supports a fast autocompletion/li   /ul   It has autocompletion; you'll have to try it to see if it is fast enough for you.     ul   liMac OS X 10.6 compatible/li   /ul   Yes.  <answer6684> There's a new text editor called strongKod/strong that is modern, fast, and support projects.   A warning -- development on Kod is just starting, so things are a bit unstable. It's alpha-level software at version 0.0.3, although I think it will eventually turn into just the application you're looking for.  Features:  ul liWritten from the ground up for 10.6 using Grand Central Dispatch and other new things/li liUses GNU Syntax Highlighting format so there's highlighting support for every language/li liModern UI with Chromium tabs/li liScriptable using node.js/li /ul  <answer21081> h1Sublime Text 2/h1  Support for TextMate snippets, languages and color schemes. Split view, tabbing, projects, commands. Full-screen on Lion and a "focused" mode. Extensible, too.  Very fast, great multiple selection mode and cross-platform.br Currently priced at $59, but a free version is available with occasional alerts.    It also has a rapidly-growing plugin API and surrounding community.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rydcr.png" alt="enter image description here"  Check it out, it's freaking awesome.  <answer34541> There is a new editor on the block called Chocolat. I've been using it for a week now and really like it. It has a lot of the features of TextMate (as well as supporting TextMate bundles) but I've found it to work a lot better with large sets of files especially over the network.  <comment123> TextMate has an awful UI - just like TextWrangler... <comment132> +1. Even though I suggested another alternative below, I couldn't live without TextMate. [hugs TextMate] <comment133> "I'm not really satisfied with the text-editors available *for MacOS X*." Is there an editor you've used on another platform that you prefer? It may be possible that a comparable equivalent exists for OS X. <comment134> @scottie same here <comment137> I forgot about this one, it's pretty complete and has the advantage of also being free and open-source. <comment138> Eclipse is a full IDE - I want a small lightweight editor. I'm using Eclipse for big projects, but for small ones it's too much overhead. <comment139> I can't remember what I used on Linux and Windows but I can't remember that I really liked an editor there... <comment141> XCode is a full IDE, not what I'm looking for. Unfortunately TextMate isn't free :( <comment149> Actually, Xcode 4 added Git and not Mercurial (as of Developer Preview 2, it could change until the final release) <comment151> The ideal program for you doesn't exist. Or, rather, it does and it's called TextMate. <comment152> @Nagon right, I fixed it. Thanks. <comment155> +1 for you're not going to find it. You have way too much prerequisites to find something that will match exactly. <comment157> I agree that there are things, well *lacking* with text editors. I also find that between TextMate / VIM and a little shell magic I can deal just fine. <comment158> Especially if, as Josh said, 'free' is one of those prerequisites. <comment199> +1 with a few choice plugins this is by far the best "light weight" text editor available. <comment210> Looks promising. Has somebody already use it ? <comment213> I think you get what you pay for in most cases and a text editor is no different so don't expect to get everything you're looking for at no cost.  The price of TextMate is really worth it IMHO. <comment219> The development of WebScripter has been suspended and is now being offered as freeware but no new versions will be released. :'( <comment220> Redcar is not finished! :( <comment254> Too bad. I will be keeping an eye on it for when it does start to mature. <comment303> That's almost what I was looking for. Didn't knew that someone "continued" Smultron :) <comment437> I was going to suggest emacs, but obviously this fits the bill <comment510> I think you need to be a bit more flexible here. You have 10 answers, with the community settling on TextMate (though I'm a `BBEdit` man myself) and Xcode, but you more or less shot down every single one within the comments. I don't think you're ever going to find the "perfect" text editor that suits your particular tastes unless you just code it yourself. <comment863> looks very TextMate'ish. Promising. <comment864> TextMate shaked the editor world when it arrived. Every new editor needs to compete against it and if you are just a single developer then it's very difficult to catch up. I quit working on my own open source editor and switch entirely to using TextMate. Sorry. <comment1153> What's awful about TextMate's UI? The entire UI is basically just a document window... <comment2311> Someone who "hates" "the look & feeling of TextWrangler" isn't going to like BBEdit either. <comment2331> TextWrangler doesn't have nearly the features that BBEdit does in terms of customization. As for "look and feel", a BBEdit window can be reduced to a fairly minimal set of interface widgets. <comment5179> this one is pretty good if you just can't get into macvim. <comment5181> @calavera yes I find it before find macvim now I just use macVim <comment7102> I still use Smultron despite the developer (the intrepid Peter Borg) ceasing development.  Notepad++ is still by far my favorite editor on _any_ platform. <comment7103> The only app that's finished is one where development has ceased.  (Directly contradicts your req #4) <comment10866> I think that you, me and many others are still looking for an OS X version of [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/). <comment23091> The bundle-related menus get overcrowded quickly (showing things like Ruby snippets and commands when I'm editing a C file) and the bundle editor is atrocious. Tabs are really bad and useless too, although I disable them right away through the plist and stick with Cmd+T and the sidebar. Code folding is unusable and its folded peek popover is a very basic tooltip (plus it doesn't work at all in Python because TM is unable to handle whitespace-delimited blocks). Well, that was before I ramped up my Vim-fu anyway. <comment23125> Take note that even if it's in alpha, I have yet to see a crash due to Kod. I'm not sure if it does autocomplete or not but I know it does highlighting among other things. <comment27512> @alopix you did not state that "free" was one of your requirements. So if the price tag and the fact that it has a rather plain interface are your only complaints then I'd say it wins. <comment27794> @sholsinger even though the free is surrounded by parentesis, it was one of my requirements ;) <comment36279> +1 if you have the patience to learn Vim you customizable powerful editor for that you can use on "all" platforms. <comment36298> But there's soooooo much value in learning vim. You can pretty much use it anywhere anytime. And it does basically everything. <comment36697> +1 for Vim or MacVim - it does everything the OP wants except that it's not very OS X app-like and has a steep learning curve. Once you can use it, it's awesome. <comment39646> Thanks! My brother told me about that one too, but I forgot the name xD <comment41839> Chocolat's good, but it disturbs me that it doesn't have tabs (not on top at least). <comment44562> It does. Just use cmd+t or the + icon at the top right to create a new tab! <comment44627> Update: I've recently switched to Sublime 2. I love it. <comment44628> I've tried TextMate, Chocolat, Coda, Eclipse and others in the past, Sublime is by far my favorite now. <comment121405> I know this is an old thread. now that Sublime Text 2 is out, (with 3 on the way--released as a blazingly fast and stable beta in fact) I'd say it takes the cake for me as well.
