Stop Safari 9 window closing when only pinned tabs are left <body> Love that Safari 9 has pinned tabs, it was the last piece that enabled me to switch from Chrome. However, I often close all tabs except the pinned tabs. However, unless I make one of the pinned tabs active and then close the other tabs it closes the whole window, pinned tabs and all.  For example, let's say I have one pinned tab and one not. If the unpinned tab is active and I hit kbdcommand/kbd+kbdw/kbd the whole window closes. But if I make the pinned tab active and then click the close button on the unpinned tab, the window stays open. Any way to keep the window open as long as there are any tabs open, pinned or otherwise?  <answer214748> If you watch the File menu, you can see kbd⌘/kbdkbdW/kbd changes depending on the number of open tabs. If there are multiple, it's "Close Tab", if there is one (not counting the pinned), it's "Close Window".  There is a workaround! You can overwrite kbd⌘/kbdkbdW/kbd to always execute "Close Tab".  Go to System Preferences  Keyboard  Shortcuts  App Shortcuts   Add a Shortcut for the application "Safari", menu item "Close Tab", shortcut kbd⌘/kbdkbdw/kbd.  If you're not using English in Safari, lookup the exact name of the menu item for closing a tab. In the Dutch version of Safari, the menu item is called "Sluit tabblad".  <answer260916> Just want to add to hachre's answer that you can achieve the same result using terminal. For emoverwrite ⌘W in Safari/em execute following lines:  precodedefaults write com.apple.Safari NSUserKeyEquivalents -dict-add 'Close Tab' '&lt;string&gt;@w&lt;/string&gt;&lt;/dict&gt;' defaults write com.apple.universalaccess com.apple.custommenu.apps -array-add '&lt;string&gt;com.apple.Safari&lt;/string&gt;' /code/pre  Then reload Safari:  precodekillall Safari open -a Safari /code/pre  I use that commands in Sierra - works great.  <comment252781> Sounds like a bug to me. I recommend you use the Feedback form to report. <comment252803> @Phong I think this is actually intended behavior since opening a new window after accidentally closing a window includes the pinned tabs. That eases the pain, but it's still really weird and different than all other browsers with pinned tabs. <comment252807> @Phong Also, good idea. I've reported this issue. <comment256531> @donut I don't think is the intended behavior. Every time the window closes and you open a new one, the tabs loads the pages again. Is really frustrating. And if they are pinned, is because I don't want to close them xD <comment256704> @Dave Please report the issue using Feedback Assistant. The more people reporting it the higher chance it'll get changed. <comment259189> I think this is intended behavior, at least in El Capitan. Really annoying, I'll post an answer here if I ever find one <comment260935> This is so annoying. <comment260994> @ArnoldRoa Have you tried the [selected answer](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/214748/52516)? It worked perfectly for me.
