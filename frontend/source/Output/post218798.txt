What are the "Overlapping Squares" icon in status menu on login screen? <body> On El Capitan's login screen the status menu (top right near time) shows an icon of two overlapping squares, one square is to the top left and looks behind the other.  It doesn't show once I login. What does this icon represe   <answer218803> Does the icon look like what is in this image?   http://cdn.osxdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/screen-sharing-messages-app-mac-os-x.jpg  If so it sounds like it would be related to Screen Sharing.  <comment264531> Yes. That's it. Why would screen share show on login screen? <comment264533> That I'm not as sure about. Is Screen Sharing enabled in System Preferences Sharing? <comment264534> Nope, screen sharing is not enabled.
