What URL does Facebook app use for data? <body> I want to block the Facebook app on my iPhone. I've blocked facebook.com in restrictions and every single Facebook URL for servers I can find - this works great in safari, but open the Facebook app and nothing is blocked. What URL do I need to block to fix this?  EDIT: I know school filters somehow are able to do this so there has to be a URL..  <answer151730> When you are blocking URL in iOS you only block them for Safari and applications using an in-app browser.   So you won't be able to block Facebook that way.   <comment178462> I would imagine there are a large range of URLs used, and they probably vary depending on your connection at any given time (since they use Content Delivery Network[s], and which node you are connected to will depend on where you are and what ISP you are connecting through). <comment178536> Why not just delete the app <comment178537> Doesn't URL blocking in Restrictions only apply to Safari anyway? <comment178550> Thanks! I do understand now that school systems block the Facebook server IPs, etc at a router level, so no device on that wifi would be able to access it. Makes sense now!
