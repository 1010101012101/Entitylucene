How can I save a document from Pages in RTF format? <body> I only found descriptions were you use the export function of Pages. But there is no RTF option anymore. So is it possible to export a Pages file to RTF?  <answer148787> So it seems that is not possible anymore in Pages 5. Here alternative programs are proposed. TextEdit is not an option for me because I need header/footers.  <answer191888> One work around you may find helpful uses the previous version of strongPages/strong which should still be in your strongApplications/strong folder unless you removed it.  ul liOpen your document in strongPages/strong version 5./li liNext, use the strongExport/strong dialog to export to strongPages '09/strong/li liThen, open the document with strongPages '09/strong/li liNow, export to strongRTF/strong/li /ul  Bit of a pain, but not too much effort.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ncI3u.png" alt="Export Pages 09 to RTF"
