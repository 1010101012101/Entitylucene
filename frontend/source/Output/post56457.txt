Should I enable TRIM with a third party (non-Apple) SSD? <body> I have an Intel 320 Series 120 GB solid state drive installed in the optical drive bay of my 2012 MacBook Pro 13". I'm not sure whether to use TRIM Enabler to enable TRIM.   I did enable it before on my 2011 MacBook Pro, but I not sure whether I really needed to. I never had problems with it enabled.   I also doesn’t want to tinker with this, when I’m not entirely sure. Maybe I should use TRIM, but enable it with something other than TRIM Enabler. I don’t know.  I know what TRIM does. And if you buy a Mac with a SSD from Apple, it is enabled by default.  <answer56459> AFAIK the Intel SSD's have a build-in clean up feature, so if you enable TRIM it 'can' slow you disk down.  Here is an article from OWC: http://blog.macsales.com/11051-to-trim-or-not-to-trim-owc-has-the-answer - which have a simular build-in feature.  <answer56465> TRIM and Garbage Collection (GC) are not the same, and are both necessary to maintain performance after the drive has been used for a while. GC only takes place in the background when idle, or when the OS needs to write to a previously used block.  TRIM proactively zeros unused areas in the background. This is why you see a slight performance hit, but on an SSD this is negligible and is a lot faster than waiting for GC to work on demand after you've been using the SSD for a while.  Using the TRIM enabler app is not advised, but you can enable it via the terminal by following these steps.  Including the Steps below (as there seems to be a certificate issue with that particular link) :     strongTRIM Enabler for OS X Lion, Mountain Lion, Mavericks/strong      OK. Now that Lion’s out, people want their SSD TRIM support back. I   have one thing to say:      DO NOT USE TRIM ENABLER (VERSION 1.1 OR 1.2) TO ENABLE TRIM ON LION.      After a little inspection of this application, I found that instead of   patching the file, it replaces an entire kernel extension. This means   that when you use TRIM Enabler with Lion, it replaces a critical   kernel extension, with lots of dependencies, with an older one (from   Snow Leopard 10.6.8). This is bad. Very bad. While TRIM does become   enabled, the kernel extension you now have has the potential to cause   a ton of problems. That means anything from kernel panics, to disk I/O   delays…and the dreaded spinning beach ball.      After confronting the developer, Oskar Groth (who I refuse to link   to), via his blog’s commenting system, I was told that I was simply   trolling and spreading fear (even though I offered the alternative I   share here). Apparently, the next version of TRIM Enabler will   correctly patch the file, instead of replacing it, but that hasn’t   happened yet.      So, here’s the proper way to enable TRIM support. Run these commands   in Terminal:      ol   liBackup the file we’re patching/li   /ol      codesudo cp   /System/Library/Extensions/IOAHCIFamily.kext/Contents/PlugIns/IOAHCIBlockStorage.kext/Contents/MacOS/IOAHCIBlockStorage   /System/Library/Extensions/IOAHCIFamily.kext/Contents/PlugIns/IOAHCIBlockStorage.kext/Contents/MacOS/IOAHCIBlockStorage.original/code      ol start="2"   liIf you’re using OS X Yosemite, disable KEXT signing/li   /ol      codesudo nvram boot-args="kext-dev-mode=1"/code      ol start="3"   liPatch the file to enable TRIM support/li   /ol      FOR ML 10.8.5 AND MAVERICKS DP4+      codesudo perl -pi -e   's|(\x52\x6F\x74\x61\x74\x69\x6F\x6E\x61\x6C\x00{1,20})[^\x00]{9}(\x00{1,20}\x54)|$1\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00$2|sg'   /System/Library/Extensions/IOAHCIFamily.kext/Contents/PlugIns/IOAHCIBlockStorage.kext/Contents/MacOS/IOAHCIBlockStorage/code      ol start="4"   liForce a refresh of the system’s kernel extension cache/li   /ol      codesudo touch /System/Library/Extensions//code      ol start="5"   liNow Reboot!/li   /ol      a) If in the future you want to disable TRIM support      FOR ML 10.8.5 AND MAVERICKS DP4+      codesudo perl -pi -e   's|(\x52\x6F\x74\x61\x74\x69\x6F\x6E\x61\x6C\x00).{9}(\x00\x54)|$1\x41\x50\x50\x4C\x45\x20\x53\x53\x44$2|sg'   /System/Library/Extensions/IOAHCIFamily.kext/Contents/PlugIns/IOAHCIBlockStorage.kext/Contents/MacOS/IOAHCIBlockStorage/code      codesudo touch /System/Library/Extensions//code      b) If something goes horribly wrong, restore the backup      codesudo cp   /System/Library/Extensions/IOAHCIFamily.kext/Contents/PlugIns/IOAHCIBlockStorage.kext/Contents/MacOS/IOAHCIBlockStorage.original   /System/Library/Extensions/IOAHCIFamily.kext/Contents/PlugIns/IOAHCIBlockStorage.kext/Contents/MacOS/IOAHCIBlockStorage/code      All this patch does is simply replace the string “APPLE SSD” in the   file IOAHCIBlockStorage with zeros. This happens to bypass the   restriction of only allowing Apple branded SSDs. The backup of the   original file is saved in the same directory as the original file.      To check if it worked, open up About This Mac, click the “More Info…”   button then the “System Report” button. In the list on the left,   choose “Serial-ATA”. Click on your SSD Drive and in the lower half of   the screen you should now see “TRIM Support: Yes” instead of “No”.      Remember, if you have an older generation SSD, the hardware itself may   not support TRIM …and therefore this patch won’t help you. This patch   bypasses the restriction put in place by Apple to restrict TRIM   support to Apple branded SSD drives.      You WILL need to re-apply this patch after each major update of OS X.   That means for 10.7.1, 10.7.2, etc.      Credit where credits due, unlike the other TRIM Enabler, I originally   found this on the InsanelyMac forums by digital_dreamer      As a note, the MD5 checksums for the original and patched file on   10.7.0 are as follows:      Original: 155b426c856c854e54936339fbc88d72      Modified: 945944136009c9228fffb513ab5bf734      If you have already used the other TRIM Enabler, you can do the   following: a) Attempt to copy and replace the extension from another   Mac running the same version. b) Attempt to copy and replace the   extension from the Recovery partition (Open up Disk Utility and Mount   Recovery HD) c) Reinstall Lion d) Wait it out till 10.7.1 and hope   that the extension is replaced in the update (but it may not be), then   re-patch the file      strongUPDATE/strong      a) Applying this patch does NOTHING else other than enable TRIM for   3rd party SSD drives. If you start seeing other problems, they’re not   because of this.      b) Using this patch has no effect on hard disk drives. Firstly,   mechanical hard disk drives do not understand the TRIM command, so it   is discarded. Secondly, the Apple driver isn’t stupid enough to send   TRIM commands to your hard disk. It knows the difference between an   SSD and a HDD.      c) The wiping free space option is ALWAYS greyed out, even on Apple   based SSDs. As reported here, you can try using codefsck -ffy/code in Single   User Mode, but personally I haven’t tested it. I’m sure there isn’t   too much to worry about, especially if your drive has garbage   collection.      d) If TRIM isn’t enabled after patching either a) you didn’t follow   the steps correctly or b) your drive doesn’t support TRIM. If your   drive doesn’t support TRIM, there’s no need to revert the patch, it   simply has no effect.      e) The TRIM patch is NOT vendor/model specific. You can patch the   driver for any damn SSD drive. Hell, you can apply the patch if you   only use HDDs, but that’d be a little silly.      f) Regarding RAID and SSDs on Mac. I’m not completely sure but…if   you’re using Apple RAID then I assume TRIM will work as usual. If   you’re using a hackintosh and using a RAID controller (i.e. Intel   ICHR), then no, RAID will not work. In either case, you should use a   drive with garbage collection.      strongUPDATE 2/strong      Regarding SSD durability and comments by Hyram:      The durability of SSDs has sweet fuck all to do with Mac OS X TRIM.   It’s a fact, and always has been, that SSDs aren’t as durable as hard   disks. This is simply due it it being a new technology. SSDs fail   often due to the wear on the cells incurred by reads and writes.      If you don’t know what TRIM is, you probably shouldn’t be using a 3rd   party SSD drive. Many have reported these commands don’t work, but   that simply isn’t true. It just shows that a lot of people here don’t   know how to use Terminal, don’t know what Bash is, nor Perl. These   aren’t the sort of people that should be messing around with this.   Instead, buy a SSD drive that offers garbage collection….or a Mac with   an Apple SSD.      There has also been some confusion about garbage collection and TRIM.   TRIM is ALWAYS preferred over Garbage Collection and will likely yield   better results. If you have garbage collection, you don’t necessarily   need TRIM, but it’ll probably offer better performance and there’s   always a chance there’ll be a degradation of speed over time.   Therefore, when using Garbage Collection, you may have to take the   drive out and do a secure erase so that everything is re-marked as   free space.      A drive will never fail because you haven’t enabled TRIM, even if it   doesn’t have garbage collection. They simply become slower and the   speed is not restored until you perform a destructive erase on the   drive. However, drives that support TRIM, but do not have GC, and do   not have TRIM enabled (in the OS) may fail more quickly than without   enabling TRIM. In a very basic sense, since the SSD is no longer told   what data to free up, when writing new data it will also re-write the   deleted data, essentially causing more write cycles and wearing down   the durability of the drive. If TRIM were enabled, the new data would   be written without the deleted data, and hence less write cycles and   extended durability. This ONLY relates to the combination of a drive   that supports TRIM with no GC, while TRIM is disabled in the OS      Running garbage collection and TRIM at the same time is NOT a problem.   They’re designed to work together. You can look at it like so: TRIM is   called by your OS each time space is freed up. Garbage Collection is   run by the drive’s firmware when idle and determines which parts of   the drive can be cleaned up and rearranged. TRIM is obviously more   efficient and obviously the drive’s firmware is aware of the TRIM   commands and accounts for this.      As for the statements by Hyram, I believe some of them to be   completely false. While it’s true that using TRIM and garbage   collection at the same time is essentially using two mechanisms to do   the same thing, the firmware on your SSD drive is designed to handle   these things. All SSD manufacturers, GC or not, recommend the use of   TRIM.      There is zero evidence that Apple has specific code to handle their   specific SSD hardware for reading and writing. TRIM is a standardized   ATA command. However, it IS likely that Apple has designed their   integrated SSDs (particularly in the Air) to not overheat. Basically,   your SSD is likely to fail just as much in your MacBook as if it were   surrounded by the same temperature in any other laptop.      emPosted on November 17, 2011/em   <answer113583> What you really should do is swap the SSD and HDD locations because the connection that the hard drive has is actually faster thus allowing you to give every piece of bandwidth from the SSD to the MLB with the HDD cable. The HDD can't go anywhere near as fast so placing that in the optical drive adapter is a wiser choice all in all, the optical drive cable is just enough that you won't notice any real performance issues in comparison to what the HDD already puts out.  <answer221256> I did this on Yosemite and badness abounded.  (Got the 'stop sign' on the boot screen.)  To fix that problem, see this: https://www.cindori.org/trim-enabler-and-yosemite/  Also, after some digging, it seems one doesn't really need to do this on Yosemite after all.  See here: https://www.cindori.org/safely-enable-trim-on-yosemite-and-el-capitan/  I've now got TRIM enabled on a Samsung 840 EVO SSD.  Yahoo.  <comment133281> Not sure if this is correct, but my MBP should have SATA3 on both connection. Also a HDD in the HDD is much more less noise because of the attenuation <comment133282> SATA3 for ODD? Not possible. <comment133283> But you are right in the regard, the MBP 2011 had this problem, the 2012 does not.  What does ODD mean? <comment133284> HDD within the HDD bay https://www.dropbox.com/s/b8cj1mbmr1cpror/Screen%20Shot%202013-12-12%20at%2013.06.14.png  SSD within the optical bay https://www.dropbox.com/s/uphsd2hziofaot4/Screen%20Shot%202013-12-12%20at%2013.06.04.png <comment195038> looks like link rot, do you still have the relevant information? If so please post (good practice generally, post relevant info so it remains if/when the link disappears). <comment195089> @Sebastian - ODD = Optical Disk Drive. <comment195090> @Andrew -  While it is true that no ODD requires SATA3 (access and read speeds would never warrant it), [some MBP (2011 and 2012) models had Sata 3 ODD connectors, others did not](http://blog.macsales.com/10433-macbook-pro-2011-models-and-sata-3-0-6-0gbs-update-5272011)... <comment325271> Agree - I am using OWC SSD's on older Macs (to give them a boost) - typical example Mac Pro 1,1 running 10.6. No Trim enabled and after 12 months + no problems or speed reduction. Having said this, I keep the SSDs limited to OS and Apps with a generous free space - everything else including User folders on a traditional (albeit upgraded) fast HDD.
