Should I disconnect my MacBook Pro's power cord when the battery is fully charged? <body> Title says all. My friend told me that I need to disconnect the power cord when the battery is fully charged. Otherwise, I will shorten the life of the battery.  Is that true? I am going to use my laptop at home 90% of the time. So, I was going to have the power cord connected all the time.  <answer12273> I would suggest that you read following 2 articles:  ol lihttp://www.apple.com/batteries//li lihttp://www.apple.com/batteries/notebooks.html/li /ol  From my personal experience, don't charge fully, and you can disconnect it after you charge till 90% or more.  <answer12274> I keep my macbook pro plugged in all the time with no adverse effects.  And if you want to use your mac laptop in clam-shell mode (ie lid closed, connected to an external monitor), then you will need the power supply plugged in anyway.  Still, I (and Apple) recommend to unplug it every month or so and use the battery a bit, just to remind it that its a battery ;)  Keeps it healthy.  <answer12280> You do not need to disconnect your MacBook Pro's battery. Your battery will stop charging once it is full. Apple's modern batteries are much smarter than previous designs.  To get the most out of your MacBook Pro's battery, follow the Notebook Battery advice from Apple: unplug and use your battery until empty about once a month, then charge back up to full.  At the time of answering, Apple's advice read:     For proper maintenance of a lithium-based battery, it’s important to keep the electrons in it moving occasionally. Apple does not recommend leaving your portable plugged in all the time. An ideal use would be a commuter who uses her notebook on the train, then plugs it in at the office to charge. This keeps the battery juices flowing.   If you need help following Apple's advice, use Battery Guardian; it is free and will remind you when to deplete your battery.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SLrJi.jpg" alt="Battery Guardian helps track when the battery needs depleting"  <answer12285> No. The nature of the lithium battery chemistry does not require periodic cycling to maintain capacity.  Furthermore, the periodic cycling described in the apple documents listed above (@I-M-JM's Post) emdoes not have an effect on the battery chemistry/em. strongIt only serves to allow the battery capacity meter to accurately track the battery capacity/strong.  hr  strongPeriodically draining the battery only serves to allow the emBattery metering/em systems to accurately estimate the remaining battery capacity. It is emnot/em needed to maintain the battery itself, and actually wastes a battery cycle./strong  Basically, if you don't run your battery down for a long time, the next time you disconnect the laptop from AC, the emestimated/em time renaming value will be incorrect. However, the actually battery capacity and runtime will be unchanged from normal.  The statement "For proper maintenance of a lithium-based battery, it’s important to keep the electrons in it moving occasionally." from Apple's site is actually incorrect regarding the lithium battery chemistry at worst, and an oversimplification at best.  hr  Furthermore, The embattery metering/em and embattery charging/em systems are separate, so inaccuracies in the battery metering system will not cause errors in charging the battery (before you ask). Lithium cells are actually quite simple to charge.

Don't treat it like a desktop.  Periodically use it the laptop while unplugged.  This is not the same a unplugging it every time the battery is full. <comment15439> Wow - I figured the long term storage implications of a full battery to be the same as always having it charged and topped up (and risk 20% permanent capacity loss annually). The new unibody batteries last so many more cycles I'm less concerned about duty cycles - perhaps the old data with simpler battery controllers is less relevant? <comment15472> You get the 20% (or similar) capacity loss **no matter what you do**, as it is a function of breakdown of the battery chemically. There is a slight increase in capacity loss if you keep the battery charged all the time (most manufacturers actually recommend long-term storage at ~40% charge). However, either way, actually using the battery is worse then keeping it charged. <comment15480> Thanks - I saw table 3 of http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/how_to_prolong_lithium_based_batteries and was amazed that they quote only 4% annual loss if the battery is at 40% charge instead of 20 % annual loss 100% charge at 25C. Makes sense why service batteries are usually 50% or less. <comment17146> If you always keep your battery topped off, then it's almost as bad as long term storage when full. That decreases the capacity between 6 and 35% annually based on temperature (these numbers are for 0 C to 40C). Discharge cycles also wear down a battery - so it's safe in the short term, but not ideal in the long term. They are replaceable so if you prefer to have shorter life by always topping off - you can pay sooner for a replacement. <comment198477> The Battery Guardian homepage, at the bottom, states: "Avoid leaving your laptop always connected to the power supply. This will shorten the life of your battery." This is a confusing endnote. <comment198484> Some MacBook owners never disconnect their computer from the mains power supply. They use the MacBook as if it were a desktop computer – always connected to the mains power and never using the portable capability of the device. At the time of answering, Apple's advice suggested that you disconnect and deplete your laptop at least **once a month**. That is, **do not** leave your laptop connected to the power supply **permanently**.
