Problem after erasing the HD of a brand new Mac (OS X Yosemite) with Disk Utility <body> I cannot reinstall OS X Yosemite now, as there's no hard drive I could see.   I had erased the HD with the idea that it will create a new partition but it didn't, so now I can't see a hard disk on disk utility. I have tried with diskutil command, but didn't succeed.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/d1NEC.jpg" alt="Disk Utility First Aid"   img src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpa1/v/t34.0-12/10872373_10152953389267174_1818483736_n.jpg?oh=f01766946dbbf63aede5b64b7b3c3cb3&amp;oe=549B503E&amp;__gda__=1419451795_5fe2e09df3cc7a7425a08f46ff580fa5" alt="Disk Utility Partition"   <answer163144> Basically you have a CoreStorage Logical Volume Group without a CoreStorage Logical Volume now. You may delete your Logical Volume Group (- step 4) or restore a Logical Volume (- step 7).
