Style text in Numbers formula <body> I have a numbers formula used in invoice generation:  precode="Invoice terms: "&amp;CONCATENATE(Terms)&amp;", please pay by ..." /code/pre  Which returns:     Invoice terms: 14 days, please pay by ...   Is there a way to apply a style to only part of the formula? I want the outputted "Invoice terms" to be bolded:     strongInvoice terms:/strong 14 days, please pay by ...   Is this possible?  <answer49090> Formats apply to entire cells and cannot be applied to only part thereof.  Can you not put "Invoice terms:" in a different cell?   <answer224836> Although one cannot style individual characters in a formula, one feature of Apple strongNumbers/strong is the canvas.  One can take advantage of this by adding tables and text objects anywhere.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/n1Ent.png" alt="Text object example"  The above screen shot uses a static (as the OP's "Invoice terms" text is hard coded in their formula example, it is assumed static) text field placed next to the table (a single cell table with no border, in this case) containing the cell with the formula.  The OP's use of the codeCONCATENATE/code function is unneeded as the ampersands do the same job.  To use codeCONCATENATE/code in this case:  precode=CONCATENATE(Terms,", please pay by...") /code/pre  Where Terms is the reference to the cell containing the Terms text.  Detailed screenshot:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4Ojxp.png" alt="Concatenate example"  By using a number for the days, this can be used in a calculation against the Invoice date to determine the date payment is due.  But that is a topic for another question. ;)  <comment56185> It doesn't seem to be possible. While you *can* format the characters in a text cell individually, the format option of a formula cell applies to the whole cell.
