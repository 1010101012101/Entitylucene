How to enable AirPrint on iPod Touch after iOS 4.2 Upgrade? <body> I have an iPod Touch (Model MC086FD) and upgraded to iOS 4.2.1 - all works fine. But I do not find the AirPrint Software on the iPod. Can I install it? How do I make my iPod print (emails etc.) when connected by WLAN?  I have a MacBook Pro with 10.6.6 Syncing with the iPod using iTunes 10.2.1. The printer is a Samsung CLX-3175FN connected by network.  I have no Print button in the share menu. Also I tried AirPrint Activator to enable for my network printer. Nothing helped.  <answer8925> AirPrint doesn't require an extra App. It works directly from the codeprint/code-menu, if your printer has support for the feature.  Here's a list of supported printer's and other notes for AirPrint: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht4356  <answer9278> My iPod touch is an 3. generation 8GB model (Model MC086FD).  As I found, Multitasking is needed to use AirPrint! But multitasking is not available for this model - even iOS 4.2 installed!  <comment9487> there is no print menu! <comment9488> Excuse me? What are you trying to print?  One example, go to `Photos  Select an album  Select a photo  Push the leftmost button on the bottom (square wit arrow coming out)  Select Print` <comment9489> There is no print, just email, contact and background! <comment9491> Are you on WiFi? <comment9493> I don't think that all apps support airprint, what app are you using? I can check if it works on mine or not as I have it set up and have printed before. <comment9494> BTW your printer is not on the list of supported devices... <comment9498> @deiga: Yes, Wifi with Same Network As Printer and Sharing macbook <comment9503> @Arne - What app are you using, like TheX already asked? There is no sense that this menu doesn't show up :D <comment9539> I have tried Mail, Photos and Safari - none of them has a print button! <comment9597> @Arne - That really makes to sense :D In what country are you? Have you tried reinstalling your iOS? <comment9601> @deiga: I am in germany. No, I have not reinstalled iOS, how to? <comment9619> @Arne - Plug your iPhone to your computer, then in iTunes, on the first page there is a button 'Restore'. Remember that this erases all data from the phone. <comment9823> Did a restore, but nothing changes - no print button <comment9853> OK, can you go into photos, open up a Photo an then open the menu from the leftmost button? Then take a screenshot of this. You take screenshots by keeping the home button pressed and then pressing the power button, the screen should flash.
