Revert iOS version on an iPad (using Configurator 2)? <body> Is there an easy way to revert the version of iOS that is loaded on a bunch of iPads?  I have 200-odd iPads and an iMac using Apple Configurator 2.  I've updated a bunch of the iPads to iOS 10.3, but I meant to only update to version 10.2.1.  Is there any way to get them back to 10.2.1? (And even better-- is there an EASY way? I'm a Configurator 2 Noob).
