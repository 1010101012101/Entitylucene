Convert single unicode character to png image <body> I need to convert a Unicode character (e.g. ⦿; CIRCLED BULLET; U+29BF) to a PNG image for use within a reporting tool (Crystal Reports).  I need to preserve the font, size, and formatting of the character.  Is there a more-accurate way to do this than just ⌘⇧+4 and a less-burdensome way than Gimp or Seashore?   <answer127536> The way I would do it is by typing it in a graphics editor and rasterizing it to a png to whatever size I need. Why not use Gimp or Seashore?  <answer127573> Character Map is the (clunky) equivalent of Character Viewer on OS X:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NNBKA.png" alt="Windoze Character Mope"  Note the Font — only certain typefaces contain codeU+29BF/code and codeU+2318/code. Most applications including Crystal Reports support Unicode Fonts.  <answer127638> Possible solution: Create Banner Image from Text  <answer127640> Using ImageMagick:  codeconvert -pointsize 64 -font /System/Library/Fonts/Apple\ Symbols.ttf label:⦿ output.png/code  codeconvert -background transparent -fill 'hsb(0%,0%,0%)' -font /System/Library/Fonts/Apple\ Symbols.ttf -pointsize 64 -size 200x200 -gravity center label:⦿ output.png/code  <comment149417> The character viewer does not work for you ? ⦿ CIRCLED BULLET Unicode: U+29BF, UTF-8: E2 A6 BF <comment149418> how large does it appear that ⌘⇧4 isn't accurate enough? <comment149421> While I can use the character viewer to select the desired character, pasting the value into a Windows XP application (Crystal Reports) is problematic--the result is a box. <comment149424> I need to have the resulting image's dimensions to match the character itself (plus a few pixels buffer).  Honestly, I'm not familiar enough with either tool to know if this is possible. <comment149425> Well i mean it's going to be imperfect no mater how you slice it. Youre going from a vector image (made of measurements that dictate the absolute shape and size of the strokes) to discreet pixels in a bitmapped image <comment149428> @TomGewecke: I tried quite a few fonts--didn't work. <comment149429> Feel free to self-answer this! The answer shouldn't really be in the question <comment149456> @l'L'l: question updated to demonstrate font issue. <comment149477> @craig Lucida Sans Unicode does not have the ⌘ character, that is why you get a box. <comment149480> Tom is correct, however, [Segoe UI Symbol](http://www.kreativekorp.com/charset/font.php?font=Segoe%20UI%20Symbol) does have both `U+29BF` and `U+2318` on Windows. <comment149542> @TomGewecke: How do you know if a font does not contain a certain character (other than the rendering of a box)? <comment149546> How did you know that the Segoe UI Symbol contained this character?  Trial and error? <comment149556> @craig You can examine the font in Fontbook  Preview  Repertoire or check the Font Variation pane in Character Viewer when the character has been selected.
