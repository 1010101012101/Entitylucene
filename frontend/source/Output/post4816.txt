Is there a good replacement for the Dock? <body>    What are the best dock replacements?      It's frustrating to keep track of   windows in the dock unless they're   minimized. For instance, I often have   10-15 separate PDF documents open.   It's a mess to keep track of them on   the dock.   -- Harry Gindi  <answer4817> A quasi-replacement worth considering is Quicksilver (download: http://www.blacktree.com/ and guide: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBvFUhTqKK4), used by a large number of devout users.  Though, that it depends on what you're looking to replace: access to apps, documents, tasks etc? It should work great. If you want something that looks vaguely like a dock/taskbar/GNOME panel, it won't replace that.  <answer4831> strongHyperDock/strong gives you window previews for each running app in the dock, which helps tremendously.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ef2yL.png" alt="alt text"  <answer187663> http://brawersoftware.com/products/ubar  I was impressed with this. It is the closest thing to a task bar replacement I found. Some of its behavior annoyed me so I did not purchase it at the end of the trial. You may fare diffently.  The DOCK is rather ill conceived for a variety of reasons, but programs leaving the dock when open is a huge one. Finding open windows is OSX is far more difficult than in Windows. alt-tab  cmd+tab then cmd+~. Seeing the window clearly on the task bar is also nice.  EDIT: I found this forum while looking for a replacement for ubar. I was unable to find one worth a crap. So I ended up buying Ubar, even tho it has some issues. Even with its issues it is better than the dock. The dock is a common complaint for windows users; this isnt a case of stubborn users rejecting change or a different way of doing things. This is a case of the taskbar really being the better way fulfill these functions.   <comment4736> What do you dislike so much about the Dock? I don't really have a problem with it. Knowing what issues you have would help create better solutions. <comment4746> LaunchBar... Alfred... Google QuickSearch Box... Even Spotlight! <comment4749> Quite right! I've actually had Spotlight replace QS for months… <comment4781> So does the Dock if you click and hold on the icon of a running app. <comment4782> I use Spotlight instead of QS too. Works fine. <comment4796> Yeah, but not like this. This is instantaneous and it doesn't take over your screen like the Expose view you get when holding a click on the app. HyperDock shows you the windows from all spaces, unlike Expose. Plus there are a whole slew of other useful things I haven't mentioned. <comment4809> This app is pretty slick, thanks for posting it <comment222629> Hi, I'm the developer of uBar. Send me an email with your issues and I'll see if I can resolve them. Cheers. <comment226528> An issue I am having is that multiple  instances of the a program do not show up as multiple (or grouped) items on the ubar, and go to the dock. So I need to use both. <comment243878> The YouTube video requires sign in! <comment243934> @Flimm This answer is 5 years old and probably no longer relevant… <comment341072> Huge fan of this app. Been a paying customer for quite some time now.  That said, as great as it is, the support is horrible.  Well, it can't be called horrible if it doesn't exist!  I tried contacting support several times over a mis-typed email address which kept me from getting my license, but the person didn't reply.  (Yes, I wrote from a different email address and yes, I included it in the text as well.) Honestly, I was so mad that after two months of trying I was going to leave, but the program is just too good, so I ended up reluctantly paying again. Love the app. Hate the support.
