Resend iMessage <body> Is there a quick method to resend an iMessage? The particular, I send an iMessage (stop and bus number) to the transit service. In cold weather, the multi-step copy, paste re-send is cumbersome. The touch screen does not like -20 weather.  <answer125494> No, not really. In iOS 7, the resend/forward button (Select a message, tap Moreâ€¦, bottom right, enter contact) is a lot more work.  However, you can set up a shortcut in Settings  General  Keyboard which should make things much faster.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jR5Et.jpg" width="350"  In the screenshot I have qqq doing that so all you have to do is type q three times and hit send.   If it doesn't have to be an iMessage, there are apps like Fast Msg that should be able to store a contact and message to send with a single tap.  <comment146891> Thanks. A good trick. Perhaps a "resend message" function will present itself in a future version.
