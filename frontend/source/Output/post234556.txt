Is there an app/extension similar to The Great Suspender but for Safari? <body> Safari is sucking wind lately, for me. I have a new 1TB hard drive in my system, put in Jan 2016. For Chrome I use Great Suspender extension - it halts tabs/sites after not being used for a while. Anything similar to this for Safari? Or any other suggestions to get Safari nice and zippy again? Thx.  <answer263243> Unfortunately, no. There are only a few utilities for listing tabs in different ways, but nothing like The Great Suspender as of the end of 2016.  <answer270548> Actually, it's not the same thing, but check out "Sessions". You can save tabs, and later on restore them.  <answer273991> Safari Extension called The Suspender by Brian Watkins  https://utahbrian.com/the-suspender/  <comment286811> Which version of Safari and which version of OSX are you using? <comment286876> Thanks for responding. @AlistairMcMillan I am using:Safari Version 9.1 (11601.5.17.1) El Capitan 10.11.4 (15E65) <comment342631> https://safari-extensions.apple.com/details/?id=com.Vocab7.thesuspender-QMHYRDLA7A <comment344430> That is great!
