How can I *unlock* a CoreStorage logical-volume without mounting it? <body> I had a damaged disk that's encrypted with CoreStorage / FileVault. DiskWarrior was unable to operate on it while encrypted, obviously (“This is an offline, unavailable Core Storage disk.”); but the codediskutil corestorage unlockVolume [UUID]/code operation emboth/em unlocks emand/em mounts the volume.  With a damaged disk like this, I'd really like to avoid emmounting/em the filesystem before working on it — I'd emjust/em like to unlock it so I can proceed with recovery tools.  Is there any way to enter the disk's password without causing it to subsequently be mounted by OS X?
