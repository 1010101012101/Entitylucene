Finder not expanding folders anymore after OSX Lion re-installation <body> I've just reinstalled Lion after having replaced the stock HDD with an OCZ Vertex 4 SSD and everything is fine apart from the Finder, which does not expand folders anymore..see the following screenshot, it happens only when you are in that view mode and click on the arrow before the folder name:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LZJaZ.png" alt="Opened folders without content"  In the image above, the folders should be expanded but they aren't... if I change the view mode and return back in this view mode, they are expanded:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Po0zK.png" alt="Same folders after view change"  Then, if I try to close the folders, see what happens:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Oak0R.png" alt="Closed folders with blank rows"  Can it be a problem of the last OSX 10.7.4 update?! Does it happen to any of you? Any idea about how I could resolve this problem?  <comment62653> I recently installed an SSD and reinstalled Lion.  I'm currently on 10.7.4 and I do *not* have this issue.  It is strange indeed. I'm assuming this happens even after a reboot.  Is that correct? <comment62656> You should blur, too, the name of the file in the path bar. If you really want to hide it. <comment62721> @Thecafremo thank you ;-) <comment62722> @ephsmith Yesterday the issue seem to have disappeared... if it appears again I'll try with a Finder's preferences reset.
