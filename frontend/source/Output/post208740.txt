El Capitan won't resume download <body> Yesterday I downloaded El Capitan partly via the Appstore. I didn't have the time to finish the installation, so I cancelled the download. Today I want to resume, but the download buttons don't work, and in the update tab I see "waiting..." and a pause button that is greyed out. I restarted and tried again, but nothing changed.  Is there a way to reset this installation or to resume it?  <answer208765> Follow these steps  App Store  purchased  check for any unfinished apps that didn't finish downloading, in my case it was Yosemite, then just click download on the app that didn't finish downloading and all your other apps should start to download including OSX EL CAPITAN.
