Web browser or extension to move multiple tabs between windows in a single action <body> In Safari, I'd like to be able select multiple tabs at once, and move them all to an open or new window. Looking for extension (or magic Safari invocation) that can do this, I find strongno/strong viable solutions.   Since Safari lacks this feature, is there any browser on OS X that does a better job of this, out of the box, or with an extension.  <answer120842> You might run a script like this in AppleScript Editor:  precodetell application "Safari"     set w to window 1     set namelist to name of tabs of window 1     repeat with i from 1 to (count namelist)         set item i of namelist to (i &amp; " " &amp; (item i of namelist)) as text     end repeat     set answer to choose from list namelist with multiple selections allowed     if answer is false then return     make new document     repeat with i in (reverse of answer)         move tab ((word 1 of i) as integer) of w to beginning of tabs of window 1     end repeat     delete tab -1 of window 1 end tell /code/pre  This moves the current tab and all tabs right of it to a new window:  precodetell application "Safari"     set l to tabs of window 1 where index â‰¥ (get index of current tab of window 1)     make new document     repeat with t in (reverse of l)         move t to beginning of tabs of window 1     end repeat     delete tab -1 of window 1 end tell /code/pre  Both scripts reload each tab though.  I normally just copy the URLs of tabs as text:  precodeset text item delimiters to linefeed tell application "Safari" to URL of tabs of window 1 set the clipboard to result as text /code/pre  I can then for example copy part of the lines and run codeopen $(pbpaste)/code.  <answer169459> Google Chrome supports this out of the box. Shift-click to select multiple sequential tabs (or cmd-click to select one --- cmd+shift-click also works) and drag them to create a new window.   Only downside is that it doesn't seem to work in fullscreen mode. This post mentions an extension "Keyboard Detach/Reattach Tab" that adds that functionality.  <comment140711> Hi, You should put a bounty on the other question rather than ask it again and making a duplication <comment140722> I just tried to clarify why I don't think this is a duplicate. I'm asking for more information than the related question did. Moreover, the answers on the related question are non-answer answers, neither of which was ever accepted. <comment140789> Just curious, typically how many tabs total across how many windows would you like to have running? Do you often need to move more than 5 tabs? <comment140795> Often enough, yes. Good question. I might end up writing an extension myself, because given my workflow (possibly misguided, but it's mine), I want to do this kind of thing all the time.
