Equivalent to alt-. in terminal <body> I am curious as to whether there is an equivalent to the kbdAlt/kbd-kbd./kbd command on Mac. On my computer it inserts the following character: ≥, instead of showing the preceding lines final parameter.  <answer1392> You have to change the Terminal’s behavior to the kbdalt/kbd key acts as a meta key (like in X11 Terms). After you check that, everytime you press kbdalt/kbd + kbd./kbd, you’ll get the last argument from the previous command. (You can repeat that command n times)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gWI31.jpg" alt="Terminal Preferences"  <answer85205> kbdESC/kbd + kbd./kbd inserts the last argument and is the direct equivalent to kbdAlt/kbd + kbd./kbd on Linux  see https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/85152/31470  <comment1189> That is pretty sweet. Is there any reason why I don't want to turn that option on? <comment1192> If you wanted to use the OS X extended characters, for example: alt + . = …  or put a Copyright © (alt + c), you would have to find another way to do it, because your ALT key won’t cut it anymore ;) Other than that, if you work with the command line a lot, it’s a good idea to have it checked. <comment109096> It's not exactly equivalent, because you can't for example press period twice while holding escape. The reason why using option as a meta key is disabled by default might be that many keyboard layouts have commonly used characters under option.
