Calendar.app fails to correctly display starting time of appointment when synced with google calendar <body> Note the time difference in the screenshot of Calendar.app.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/N2Z1c.png" alt="enter image description here"  The appointment has been created directly on the google calendar webapp. It starts at code9.00/code and ends at code10.00/code.   After syncing with Calendar.app it shows up as you can see in the screenshot.  The detail information on the appointment is one hour too early. This happens reproducibly every time I create a new appointment.  Calendar.app: codeVersion 8.0 (2032.6.1)/code  OSX: code10.10.2 (14C109)/code    <answer170183> Switching off timezone support fixes the display problems:   codeCalendar Preferences &gt; Advanced &gt; Uncheck Time Zone Support/code
