Why won't Launchpad create a .db file? Restarts reset Launchpad <body> Launchpad will not create a .db file in ~/Library/Application Support/Dock to save the state of Launchpad.  It always resets to default upon restart. I have tried many terminal commands, the most recent being:  precoderm ~/Library/Application\ Support/Dock/*.db ; killall Dock  defaults write com.apple.dock ResetLaunchPad -bool true; killall Dock /code/pre  How can I force Launchpad to create this file?   <answer284644> Check the permissions of the code/Dock/code folder. If that's all good, try this issue out in a new administrator user over in System Preferences  Users &amp; Groups.  <comment359032> Permissions are I (admin) have Read and Write.  I created a new admin, and tested this out. I rearranged Launchpad layout and restart. The new layout saves, but ironically no .db file is created in the /Dock folder. It must be saving the file elsewhere.
