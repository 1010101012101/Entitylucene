How to make a Mac mini 5,2 with bad discrete 6630 GPU run a Linux distro with iGPU <body> First post here, so be kind with the newbie. I have a major problem with a Mac mini 5,2 (Mid 2011) that gone bad with its 6630 Radeon HD discrete GPU.  I need to salvage this little machine and install a suitable Linux distro, so to make it run under the iGPU (Intel 3000HD). Is this possible to be done?   Up to know, I have tried using the "Mac Linux USB Loader" app with many Linux distros but I constantly get loading errors, as the following:  -alloc magic is broken- - error no suitable video-  Has anyone ever succeeded in something similar? I really need to make that Mac Mini useful again, without paying a load of money to Apple for a (maybe) unstable fix.  Please respond with a step by step, guide or a tutorial maybe to make things easier for me to follow.
