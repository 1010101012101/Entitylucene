Visual Studio on Mac - What to install? <body> I want to build a .NET Core Web API on my Mac using Visual Studio for Mac Preview.  When installing, I have options to install components. I don't believe I will need neither of them since I won't be needing Camarim or Intel HAXM, but I don't have that option. If I uncheck them all, "Continue" grays-out.  My question is: Am I missing something here or do I really need one of those?  I'm really tight on disk space, so I'm saving wherever I can.
