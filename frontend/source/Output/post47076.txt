Why can I no longer open the Security & Privacy pane of System Preferences? <body> h1Problem/h1  Since April 2012, one user of my MacBook Pro can no longer load the Security &amp; Privacy pane.  When I click the icon, a sheet drops down:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eFG0S.png" alt="enter image description here"  Translated from Chinese to English:     strongError/strong      Cannot load System Preferences pane "Security &amp; Privacy".   This is chaotic for me. Please: what has happened, and how can I fix it?  I also posted to Apple Support Communities:   ul liSecurity &amp; Privacy System Preferences pane cannot open!/li /ul  h2Environment/h2  Lion, Mac OS X 10.7 - 10.7.1 - 10.7.2 - 10.7.3 (Build 11D50b).   I setup two users:   ul liemzoomq/em — my own account/li liemwan/em — my wife's  account, not often used by her/li lizh-CN (PRC Chinese) (Mainland China, simplified characters) preferred for both users/li liboth are administrators/li liinstall/uninstall software is all standard steps./li /ul  h2Troubleshooting/h2  User emzoomq/em can not load the pane.   Switch users, emwan/em can open the pane without problem.   All other preference panes open and work fine.   When the problem occurs, nothing is logged. I have tried codetail -f/code and all kinds of /var/log .log files.  I have not touched many system files.  I try remove /Users/zoomq/Library/Preferences/com.apple.se*  precodecom.apple.security.plist com.apple.security.revocation.plist com.apple.security.revocation.plist.lockfile /code/pre  and rebooted, nothing changed.  precode$ ls /Library/Preferences/com.apple.se* com.apple.security.appsandbox.plist com.apple.security.plist com.apple.security.systemidentities.plist com.apple.servermgrd.plist /code/pre  For emwan/em, ~/Library/Preferences/ com.apple.security.* files are not present.   <answer48170> h1Try applying a combo update/h1  You might try:   ol lidownload the most recent MacOSXUpdCombo10.7.3.dmg/li lilog in as emzoomq/em /li liprefer British English or British/li liinstall the combination update/li lirestart the computer, you should find 11D50d or greater /li lirun Software Update until all other updates are installed/li liprefer Chinese (simplified)/li liquit System Preferences/li lireopen System Preferences, retry the preference pane./li /ol  h2Background/h2  At OS X Lion Update 10.7.3 (Client Combo) there is no hint that Apple published different downloads with identical names. Differences between 11D50b, 11D50c and 11D50d are not published by Apple. This situation surrounding 10.7.3 is most unusual.  Generally, without focus on 10.7.3: in some problem situations, people find that installation or re-installation using a combo has a positive effect.   In this case: the emb/em in your current installation, em11D50b/em, probably indicates that a combo (combination) update has been applied once already — maybe through the Software Update routines that are integral to OS X. Reapplying the same update, or a more recent build of the same update, should do no harm.   There may be more technical ways of investigating causes of your problem. However: because the symptoms are unusual, I am inclined to suggest a combo update before anything else.   <comment53972> For the user where the preference pane does load: is the preferred (uppermost) language the same as your preferred language? <comment53974> Which language do you prefer when the sheet in your screenshot drops down? Since you last loaded the pane, has any new or updated software been installed? <comment55152> all is Chinese cn_zh - i setup 2 user: zoomq , wan - all as administrator - now, "zoomq" can not load "Security & Privacy " preference pane - "wan" is my wife's  account, but she not often usage  so this make chaos for me... - what happen? - i not touch many sys. files... - install/uninstall software is all std. steps <comment55155> Was the problem noticeable before the update to Mac OS X 10.7.3? From which version did you update: 10.7, 10.7.1 or 10.7.2? Which build is your installation of 10.7.3: 11D50, 11D50a, 11D50b, 11D50c or 11D50d? <comment55156> When your wife's account *wan* is used without problem, is it a fast user switch, or does *zoomq* log out before *wan* logs in? wan's view of the parental controls pane should not list administrator zoomq. Does that pane appear proper to wan? <comment55168> update auto from 10.7 - 10.7.3, now is Mac OS X Lion 10.7.3 (11D50b) <comment55169> Thanks.
