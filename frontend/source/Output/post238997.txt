Show desktop shortcut in El Capitan? <body> I can't find a shortcut that's working on my MacBook Air. In Windows you can either click the rightmost part of the task bar to show the desktop or hit Windows+D to show the desktop. How do I do this in El Capitan?  <answer238999> One way is to set a Hot Corner to show the Desktop.  This is done via: System Preferences  Desktop &amp; Screen Saver  Screen Saver  Hot Corners...  Then select Desktop in the pop-up list for the corner you'd like to show the Desktop when you move the mouse to that corner.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hdhtR.png" alt="ScreenShot"  <answer239001> The default shortcut for showing the Desktop is:  kbd⌘Cmd/kbd-kbdF3/kbd  Technically, the official name is kbd⌘Cmd/kbd-kbdMission Control/kbd but unless you know what "Mission Control" is, you would end up searching for that as well.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sz660.png" alt="enter image description here"  Apple has a really good listing of all it's shortcuts - I keep this bookmarked for quick reference.  <answer240300> Under codeKeyboard &gt; Shortcuts/code in System Preferences, you'll see the codeShow Desktop/code shortcut within the codeMission Control/code category. You can set it to whatever you want.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ylKdY.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer278919> If you don't really like the Cmd+F3 option (the apps hovering at the corners don't really feel like "I've reached my desktop" for me) and need the exact same Windows-style Windows+D feature, you can try this,  ol liCreate a new desktop/li liFor the most frequently used applications on your dock, right-click on them, and select strongOptions-Desktop 2/strong./li liGo to strongSystem Preferences-Keyboard-Shortcuts-Mission Control/strong and assign shortcuts for your main desktop and desktop 2. /li /ol  Lo and behold, you have a shortcut to reach your desktop. This system works really well for me and helps me multi-task very well. It also has the added advantage of not minimizing any windows. All windows are a desktop away.  I also set my Finder app to launch in my main desktop as I use it to browse and open files, which open in other desktops.  Of course, this won't work for new apps unless you set the option for them too explicitly. But I feel the purpose behind the question was to improve your everyday workflow, which would only involve frequently-used applications. And this option will definitely help. (For me, I explicitly made Preview, Terminal, Chrome, Sublime Text and some 4-5 other apps to launch on the second desktop).  <comment293220> It would appear that your question has been answered, in the interest of keeping things running smoothly could you please pick one of our answers at correct :)
