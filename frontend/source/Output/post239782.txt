Stop dock moving between monitors while moving mouse to the bottom of screen <body> We know why it is moving: Why does my dock keep moving back to my other monitor?  Now, how can we stop it? Some terminal command or even paid software?  <answer239783> You cannot "just" stop it - unfortunately.  You have some options to keep it in the same place, but they have drawbacks:  A) Keep the dock on the left or right side of the desktop. That way it will stay in place.  or  B) In Preferences = Mission Control, uncheck "Displays have seperate spaces". Now the dock will stay in place, but you will loose the spaces functionality.  <comment294584> You don't lose Spaces functionality, merely change how it works. You would then have 2 displays in each Space & they will switch together rather than independently. For some people [me included], this is preferred functionality. <comment294603> Yes, that's right - but depending on how you want it to work, you would loose the effect of having seperate spaces for each display. If you really want that, then you're out of luck. If you don't care for that, then this solution is really good.
