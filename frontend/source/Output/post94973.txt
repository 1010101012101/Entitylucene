Recovery mode asks for a password OS X 10.8.2 <body> When I tried booting into recovery mode (kbdCmd âŒ˜/kbd + kbdR/kbd) during boot up, there's a field asking for a password. I do not know this password.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MPNr1.jpg" alt="Password Screen"  I am using a late-2009 21.5" iMac.   Anyone know what to do?  <answer94975> From the image, it looks like a Firmware password.  This bash script may be able to decrypt your firmware password, however it only works on a limited set of computers.  precodepython -c "print ''.join(chr(int(c, 16) ^ 170) for c in '`sudo nvram security-password`'.split('%')[1:])" /code/pre  Source  <answer144844> If your mac is pre 2011 then removing a strip of ram and rebooting will clear the problem. I have done this with quite a few that I have installed new systems onto and it seems to work very well. Give it a try, what have you got to lose.  <comment111361> So, is there someone who set the firmware password on that machine?  Ask them... Or you are the only user, and somehow did it yourself accidentally? <comment111378> Hey! Thanks very much for the help. I already decrypted the password and managed to get into recovery mode using the tutorial here: http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-13727_7-57521667-263/use-the-calculator-to-reveal-a-macs-firmware-password/. Thanks again! <comment111379> @moka No problem :D You do realise that was the same link that I put in my post ;) <comment111384> I faintly remember doing it ages ago but I guess I forgot it. The password was definitely one of mine. <comment111385> Oh haha sorry, I didn't check the source link. Thanks again for the help. :)
