Getting Bluetooth to Work After Moving Boot Camp Partition to New Mac <body> I had a Boot Camp partition with Windows 7 on my 2008-era MacBook Pro, and everything worked fine.  I have a new MacBook Pro. I partitioned it using the Boot Camp Assistant, and then I copied my old Boot Camp partition using Winclone.  After booting into Windows on the new Mac, I ran the Boot Camp Windows Support stuff, which supposedly installed current drivers.  Almost everything works fine: I have the hi-res display, trackpad works fine, sound works fine, etc.  However, Bluetooth isn't working at all.  When I try to add a device, no Bluetooth devices appear in the list.  In Device Manager, the "Apple Broadcom Built-in Bluetooth" icon has a yellow warning triangle on it.  I tried uninstalling that driver and then re-running the Boot Camp Windows Support setup, but I'm back to the same situation.  Any suggestions?  (Other than reinstalling Windows and all my Windows applications from scratch.)  <answer35427> Apparently the problem is that the "Apple Broadcom Built-in Bluetooth" driver is not the right one for the new hardware.  Here's what I did to fix it:  ul liOpen Device Manager, open the Bluetooth Radios subtree, right-click the "Apple Broadcom Built-in Bluetooth" icon, and choose the "Update Driver Software..." menu item./li liChoose "Browse my computer for driver software"/li liChoose "Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer"/li liSelect "Apple Inc." for Manufacturer, and "Apple Built-in Bluetooth" for Model, and click Next./li /ul  After the driver installed, "Apple Broadcom Built-in Bluetooth" had been replaced by "Apple Built-in Bluetooth" and "Microsoft Bluetooth Enumerator" in the Bluetooth Radios subtree of Device Manager, and I was then able to use the strongAdd a device/strong wizard to set up my Bluetooth mouse and keyboard.  <comment74036> Excellent answer! +1
