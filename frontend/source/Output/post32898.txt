Set keyboard shortcuts for launching programs <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   Can I create a shortcut to open a specific application on OS X?       On all my other machines, I can type kbdCtrl/kbdkbdAlt/kbdkbdW/kbd to launch a web browser, kbdCtrl/kbdkbdAlt/kbdkbdE/kbd for an email client, etc.  I have looked but haven't been able to find how to set this up on my mac.  Can this be configured on a mac? Preferably without external software.  <answer32903> This can be achieved by using an Automator service and assigning it a shortcut in the Keyboard System Preference pane:  ol liLaunch strongAutomator/strong and select “Service” as the type of new workflow to create./li liSet the workflow to take “no input” in “all applications”./li liDrag a “Run program“ action from the “Utilities” category into the workflow, set it to the app you want to start via a keyboard shortcut./li liSave the service under a memorable name./li liGo to strongKeyboard Preferences → Shortcuts/strong (in System Preferences, or chooses “Configure Services” from the “Services” submenu in the Apple menu)./li liSelect the “Services” category, locate your newly created service and assign it a shortcut (make sure it is checked to be active)./li /ol  Voilà – you have a global keyboard shortcut to start your application. Rinse and repeat as needed. Note Automator services are pretty laggy when first started during a session, but reasonably responsive after that.
