Why is the coreaudiod daemon using 5% or more CPU? <body> Every time I listen to music on iTunes or VLC, I notice that the process coreaudiod causes an unusually high CPU usage (5% or more).  h3Are you having the same issue? What's the reason for such a high CPU usage?/h3  ul liRecent OS X updates have not changed this observation. Restarting (or killing the process so it respawns) doesn't fix the problem. After a couple of seconds, CPU usage of coreaudiod goes above 5% again./li liIt's important to note that strongusing line out makes the problem go away/strong and coreaudiod's CPU usage goes down to 1%-2%./li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7Je2K.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer34709> This appears to be a know issue, and hopefully will be fixed in an update in the future. For now though, there are one or two things you could try (it goes without saying that make sure all software is updated to its highest stable version)  ul liFirst of all, restart your computer. /li liSecond of all, install Onyx. Install and open, and click on the 'Cleaning' tab. Under that, make sure, on the 'System' section, that the 'Audio Components' option is checked. Click execute, and let it do it's thing. /li liThen open Disk Utility, select your startup volume, and repair all disk permissions. Let it run, then close all apps and restart again. /li /ul  I hope this helps relieve the problem in some way, but I cannot guarantee it, having not been afflicted with it myself, however this is the course of action I take whenever my CPU usage is higher than I would expect it to be due to a process.  <answer76381> Seems like creating the folder Library/Preferences/Audio worked for at least some people. Have you tried it?  <answer79748> This could be audio plugins that run under core audio.  <answer100828> I just had the same issue on 10.8.4.  Quitting Boom.app seems to have resolved it for me.  I think Boom uses similar technology as AirFoil, so it might be worth quitting or uninstalling anything that somehow captures and modifies or redirects the audio-stream.  Perhaps the app afflicting you saves state per output device, and it's state for your built-in speakers is borked somehow.  <answer107401> The high CPU usage of coreaudiod is due to the ambient noise reduction software working (surprisingly, even when the built-in microphone is not in use).  Go to strongSystem Preferences  Sound  Input/strong and uncheck the strongUse ambient noise reduction/strong box.  Then, either reboot or run this one-liner to reload coreaudiod, and you should see coreaudiod CPU usage drop to 1% or less.  <answer112865> I found that killing Flash fixed the problem for me.    I rebooted yesterday to see if that would fix the problem, but by this afternoon, codecoreaudiod/code had accumulated 6 hours of CPU time. I have not used any audio apps (VLC, iTunes, etc.).  I turned off "ambient noise reduction" and there was no impact - still at 8-10% CPU. I noticed Flash running with a much lower CPU (~1%), but I did not realize that I was visiting any Flash-based websites. I killed Flash, and codecoreaudiod/code disappeared from Activity Monitor. When I re-enabled "ambient noise reduction" there was no impact - codecoreaudiod/code still gone. (This all on OS X 10.9.)  <answer121736> Disabling "Google Voice Search Hotword (Beta)" extension in Google Chrome helped... OS X 10.9.1 Mavericks  <answer126906> My coreaudiod was using about 12% before unchecking the ambient noise reduction option.  At that point it dropped to 5%.  So, that helps but I'd like to see it closer to 0%.  <answer138989> Some people claim this helps:  precode$ sudo launchctl unload /system/library/launchdaemons/com.apple.audio.coreaudiod.plist $ sudo rm -r /Library/Preferences/Audio/ $ sudo mkdir /Library/Preferences/Audio $ sudo chown -R _coreaudiod:admin /Library/Preferences/Audio $ sudo launchctl load /system/library/launchdaemons/com.apple.audio.coreaudiod.plist /code/pre  For me it turned out the cause was this HipChat issue.  <answer177787> This is indeed due to Google Chrome browser continuously using the microphone to listen for the hotword 'OK Google'. While unchecking noise reduction in the system audio preferences will decrease CPU usage (in my case from 12% to 8% coreaudiod) this does not fix the underlying issue.  To completely resolve the issue open Google Chrome - Settings - Search - and disable 'Enable "OK Google" to start a voice search'.  My coreaudiod CPU usage went from 12% to zero.  <answer202170> Certain applications appear to be triggering this problem when interacting with the microphone.  The problem goes away a minute or two after the problem applications are closed.  h2Problem applications/h2  These applications need to be restarted in order to restore normal CPU usage.

Are you using sound enhancer, crossfade, equalization or mixing the balance in any way? What CPU/GPU combination is being used? What hardware model (some have audio boards...)... It might be normal, it might be something you can change depending on the details. <comment32396> Hi, No the problem goes away as soon as i plug in earphones...  and i'm not using crossfade/equalization/sound enhancer, it's a normal iTunes installation. It was not this way in Snow Leopard.  Apple did NOT fix the coreaudiod issue in 10.7.2 <comment34095> I'm having the same issue. Mac OS X 10.7.2; coreaudiod is using 8% CPU constantly. Issue goes away when I plug in the headphones. 2.4GHz Core 2 Duo MBP. I've read somewhere that Parallels could be under suspicion - anybody here using Parallels? <comment36389> I experience the same too when I play through the speakers, I'll try the headphones. Thanks for sharing the tip, Haytham. <comment39726> This is not a solution in any way, shape or form. <comment42737> I wonder if this could be CPU required to perform some sort of DSP for the built-in speakers. A filter and clipping perhaps? <comment46232> This problem still persists in 10.7.3. When listening to the radio, the coreaudiod is up at 10%! <comment65769> Problem still persists in 10.8 GM <comment88603> The user just copied `/Library/Preferences/Audio/` from another computer. I also had the issue on my previous Mac though. If it worked for someone, can you upload the plist files somewhere? <comment92113> While this seems reasonable at first, it does not explain why  "plugging in earphones or external speakers makes the problem go away". <comment103603> CPU went from 8 to 120 % and was constantly fluctuating. Deleting Library/Preferences/Audio did not work for me but the instructions from All Maxwell did the trick. <comment118692> The poster did not indicate that he's using any third-party plugins or applications, other than VLC. <comment146227> I tried muting BoomDevice (under System Preferences-Sound) in both the Output and Input device lists, and my CPU usage for coreaudiod immediately dropped. <comment146228> Interestingly, I uninstalled Boom a long time ago, but BoomDevice is still installed.. I'll have to fix that. <comment182392> Turns out it was HipChat for me too <comment243826> Dropped from 11% to 8% while audio is muted and nothing is playing.  (2015 MBP 13") <comment243827> Experiencing this problem on brand new MBP 2015 13".  Usually hovers around 11% while muted, nothing playing or plugged in.  foo bar's answer brought it down to 8%.

After closing the tab, the cpu usage immediately disappeared. <comment299476> After changing the setting, I also had to run "sudo killall coreaudiod" to actually get the CPU utilization to drop. I imagine rebooting would have accomplished the same thing as well. <comment339096> Note that running `sudo killall coreaudiod` will make it so that you have no sound at all until you either reboot or properly reload coreaudiod. [This one-liner](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/246514/99817) should do the trick if you don't want to reboot.
