Facebook Crashes When Trying To Display A Map <body> I have an iPhone 6 plus. Just recently, Facebook crashes every time it tries to display a status, in the news feed, that contains a map of where someone checked in. I've tried a hard reset as well as removing and reinstalling the app, with no luck. I've also checked the settings for maps and location services. Any assistance would be appreciated.
