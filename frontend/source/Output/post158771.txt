Root Device UUID Error while installing Mountain Lion on VirtualBox 4.3 <body> While installing Mountain Lion on VirtualBox, it starts booting, then stops at the line "root device uuid: xxxx-xxxxx-xxxx". I've allocated all the required RAM and memory, but even after looking online and fiddling with my settings I still can't get it to work. Any thoughts on how to fix it?  <answer166541> I ran into this problem recently while attempting to install a Mountain Lion VM on my Mac Pro (10.10) using VirtualBox 4.3.2.  I was trying to follow the instructions here, but I got stuck in the EFI boot sequence.  I attached a screenshot, but I think its where you got stuck too.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/01hQu.png" alt="Screen Shot of error"  I tried the same process on my macbook pro laptop (with the same iso), and it worked fine.  I fiddled with it for a while and found a solution.  If you follow those same instructions, but before you start the VM remove everything except CD/DVD from the boot order, it properly boots to the installer and you can continue with the process.  Forgive VM name typo img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rfb3K.png" alt="ss"  Make sure you restore the boot order before it restarts.  <answer269097> Uncheck enabled EFI and Clock hardware  <comment195405> Thank you so much, this fixed it perfectly!
