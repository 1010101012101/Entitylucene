Windows have pinstripes and large corner radius on Lion <body> Somehow, some codedefaults/code setting or something in Lion on my MacBook Pro has gotten set terribly wrong, because starting recently, my inactive windows (and certain other window chrome) have gained what I presume to be 10.4 Tiger-style pinstripes.  Behold the horror:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YCfeX.png" alt="Pinstripes on inactive windows"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nD5iv.png" alt="Pinstripes on dialog boxes"  Obviously, this is strongnot acceptable in any way/strong. I don't know what I did that made these appear. I've looked through Secrets, but haven't found anything relevant. Does anyone have any ideas?  strongEDIT:/strong I just realized that in addition to the pinstripes, windows' corner radii have grown larger, as they were in Tiger and before, as well. What in the world is going on?  <answer31819> It turns out that I overlooked the two checkboxes in Secrets depicted below (even though their labels were red and in bold and they are obviously in every way exactly what I was looking for). The second one, "Use Leopard window values", was unchecked. Checking it and rebooting restored all windows to their normal appearance. Phew.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/llI0h.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment35718> Not gonna lie, I quite like them myself. <comment35727> Is it possible that you installed anything to change OS X's appearance?
