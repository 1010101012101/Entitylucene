I have a Macbook pro which shutdown randomly (and gave the shutdown cause -128 error, and also the reference code PPT004 - the battery requires service). When I cleaned the build up dust it started functioning normally again!  I just removed the backplate and used a can of compressed air to clean it. Check https://www.ifixit.com/Device/Mac_Laptop to see how you can remove the backplate of your model.  PS: Try not to touch any parts inside, because of static discharge  <comment313370> Please don't start a new question to add details, edit your original which will then add it to the review queue to be re-opened. <comment313375> I concur with Tetsujin - rewrite your original question.  Also, issue the following command `syslog | grep -i "shutdown cause"` and post the results.    You may also want to run [Apple Hardware Test (AHT)](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201257).  Hold the D key while booting from a powered off state with the AC adapter connected.   This will help you determine if you have a hardware issue <comment313385> Ah that makes sense. My thought was to open a new one because the original has -4 votes, so I figured it was as good as dead. Is that false? <comment313386> Previous shutdown cause: -128 <comment313396> Reference code PPT004 -- the battery requires service
