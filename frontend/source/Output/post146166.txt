iTunesConnect sign in trouble <body> I have trouble with emiTunesConnect/em.  Since yesterday my strongApple developer account is activated/strong.  When I sign in the strongDev Centers it's working fine/strong.  strongBut/strong on emiTunesConnect/em, when I try to sign in, I'm connecting to strongan account where I'm admin AND NOT legal/strong (emit's the same apple id/em, I'm connecting to an account strongwhere i'm just a user not the owner/strong).  How to sign in strongmy own dev account/strong ?  <answer146172> If your Apple ID works to log you into iTunes Connect and you lack some authorities on your primary Apple ID - here are the things I would do in order:  ol liLog out and then open a private browsing / incognito window and then log back in without any pesky cookies or other history./li liGo to strongAgreements, Tax, and Banking/strong and verify that you have two valid Master Agreements that are both effective and not expired and then click done./li liGo to strongUsers and Roles/strong and click on the AppleID you are using./li liGo to strongRoles/strong and verify that the Legal and Admin check boxes are grey and selected. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/J6DnO.png" alt="iTunes Connect - Users and Roles"/li liRepeat the above step for any additional AppleID that are associated with your account to verify the proper roles for each (if you have secondary accounts)./li liIf all else fails, go to strongResources and Help/strong and click the strongContact Us/strong to request one-on-one help with your specific account since you will be unlikely to fix whatever is wrong at that point yourself on iTunes Connect since it would be a server side data issue and/or that you haven't accepted the required legal agreements during the sign up and activation process./li /ol  <comment172254> This not the problem. I use the same Apple ID for Role as Admin on a friend's dev account and on my own dev account. And I cannot sign in my personnal dev account. I'm always as admin on the account of my friend
