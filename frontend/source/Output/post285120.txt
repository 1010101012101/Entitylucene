Key combination not working when using the touch bar? <body> In an IDE I use key combinations like shift + âŽ‹ (Esc). I'm now using a macbook pro with a touch bar. Seems this is not working anymore, as the IDE only reports Esc being pressed. Has anyone else experienced this?   PS: I've heard about the workaround of mapping caps lock to Esc, but I'd like to use that as a last resort.  https://discussions.apple.com/message/31347902#31347902 https://discussions.apple.com/message/31206769#31206769
