One Odd-Sized page in Pages Document for PDF <body> Need to embed a Numbers spreadsheet in a Pages doc that will “live” as a PDF. Generating a scaled image that I then embed results in mediocre resolution.  <answer127672> If there's no way to scale your numbers doc small enough to fit on a pages sized page, you'll have to use a larger paper size (e.g. legal).   If you emonly/em want your numbers doc to be a different size, you'll need to handle them separately. I'm not aware of any way to change the dimensions of a single page in pages directly but...   If the document will "live" as a PDF, why not export the pages doc to PDF in standard Letter or A4 size without your spreadsheet.  Then create a custom page size in your Numbers doc to fit the spreadsheet as a whole and export that to pdf.  Finally, use preview to combine the two documents.   <comment149598> Thanks!  Had no idea Preview could do this!
