In Xcode 8 beta how do I view storyboard as a generic (square) device? <body> I selected: Main.storyboard  View Controller  Attributes inspector  Size: Inferred  I also selected View as: iPhone 6 from the menu at the bottom of the storyboard window.  How do I view it as a generic or square device?  <comment300128> I think this option is now removed. The closest You can get is to choose iPad in landscape orientation and 3/4 of the screen... <comment300130> Thanks. So I don't need to 'worry' that I can't return to the starting generic / square device? <comment300131> No need to worry. Apple changed the way of presenting the ViewController in Storyboards.
