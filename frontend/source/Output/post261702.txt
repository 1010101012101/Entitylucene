Apple Watch Siri cannot stop workout <body> I can say into my watch: codeHey Siri, start Outdoor walk/code and it will open the codeWorkout/code app on the watch and start that specific workout.  Later I say codeHey Siri, stop workout/code and this used to work - the workout would stop.  Now Siri says codeI wish I could but workout is not set up with me/code and I cannot see any options to do that.  <answer267456> According to this Apple  support page, it doesn't appear that Siri can end a workout.   The site only show Siri starting a workout, as you've already found.   You can always submit feedback to Apple  and suggest this feature be added.
