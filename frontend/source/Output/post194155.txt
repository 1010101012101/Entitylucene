I'm having gaming problems <body> I have a game on my phone that I want to restart and play from the beginning. How can I Erase the data to start over?  <answer194164> If it's a game that doesn't save your stats in the cloud the simplest way would be to delete and redownload the app.  <comment231519> really, you have a game! good for you :) <comment231520> It depends on the game and what the developers have provided you will have to ask them
