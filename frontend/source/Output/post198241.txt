Macbook Pro 2012 shutsdown suddenly at 25% battery <body> I have a Macbook Pro Unibody Mid 2012 and used the battery for only 118 cycles.  Since a few weeks ago whenever I'm on battery and it reaches &lt;25% my Macbook shuts down immediately (no warning, no saving, so all my work is gone if I let it happen)  I'm okay with battery losing 25% of its capacity! but shouldn't this be from the top? I mean it can just reach to 0 faster, or display warnings!  Battery is really working, it still holds for ~3 hours, and I just can't replace it yet (and also no warranty, no apple shop near me)     Is there an application out there which can change my battery sensor functions and set 25% = 0% (I mean it works just like a normal Macbook with less capacity available on battery)?   codeP.S. Already tried installing Yosemite, and resetting SMC/code  When not on Battery:  precodeCharge Information: Charge Remaining (mAh): 5653 Fully Charged:  Yes Charging:   No Full Charge Capacity (mAh): 5653  Health Information: Cycle Count:    118 Condition:  Normal Battery Installed:  Yes Amperage (mA):  0 Voltage (mV):   12529 /code/pre  When on Battery  precodeCharge Information: Charge Remaining (mAh): 5545 Fully Charged:  Yes Charging:   No Full Charge Capacity (mAh): 5696  Health Information: Cycle Count:    118 Condition:  Normal Battery Installed:  Yes Amperage (mA):  -1149 Voltage (mV):   12361 /code/pre  <answer198244> Every battery in a MacBook has a battery processor, which, from time to time, should be recalibrated. Like this: 1. Fully charge your Mac 2. Use it until it dies 3. Once dead, wait at least 5 hours, no less, then plug it in and charge it to 100%, without using it.  The battery percentage reading on your Mac should now be more accurate.  If this doesn't fix it, don't but a new MacBook or give away this one, your MacBook just needs a new battery.  <comment237173> when you took this screen shot you were not on battery power, but on the charger. Could we have one on battery power without charger. SMC reset could be tricky, double check and redo it. <comment237177> @Buscarì›ƒSD I added the Info when on battery, Also I already reset SMC like 2-3 times. <comment237178> Thank you, I haven't tried this yet (leaving it for 5 hours after it shuts down), I will try this today.
