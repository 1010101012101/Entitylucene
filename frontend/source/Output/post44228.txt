Can I make hot corners require a mouse click to be triggered? <body> I love the "Hot corners" concept. However, it happens very often that I trigger them accidentally.  Is there a built-in way to add a "click" requirement to a hot corner? ie. I have to move the mouse there and then to left-click.  (This would also help recreate Windows 7's "show desktop" behaviour, which is cool for people who recently switched from there to OS X.)  <answer44230> h2Modifier Keys/h2  or emkeyboard/em click ;)  You can hold kbd&#x2318;/kbd, kbd&#x21E7;/kbd or kbd&#x2325;/kbd when selecting a hot corner.  You will need then to use the modifier key and the hot corner to trigger the action.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MaicF.png" alt="enter image description here"  h2strongBetterTouchTool/strong/h2  While you cannot use hot corners, you can use a single finger gesture like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/g6nPq.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment50252> Thanks gentmatt. A mouse-only method would be ideal, but I can work with this if that is not possible. <comment50255> @Pekka Maybe BetterTouchTool helps. It's not an optimum solution and without hot corners. <comment50256> Beat me to it! While I was writing my answer (and rebooting because BetterTouchTool was acting odd), you wrote a much better one. Well done! <comment50257> The corner click in BetterTouchTool seems to apply to the Trackpad only (ie. no mouse clicking, which is a shame! I'll write to the author and ask whether that could be added). But it's a very interesting tool either way. Thanks!
