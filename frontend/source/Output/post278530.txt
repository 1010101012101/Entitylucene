Save Podcast on iPhone without Downloading <body> I've been using the Podcasts app and I'd like to be able to mark in some way the episodes that I really like. I was saving them but I realized that they get downloaded if I do that, which causes space issues.  Is there a way to save a podcast without actually downloading it? I'm open to other apps that are a reasonable replacement and can achieve what I'm trying to do here.  <answer280729> You could strongmark as unplayed/strong but there doesn't appear to be anything like the heart in Music.
