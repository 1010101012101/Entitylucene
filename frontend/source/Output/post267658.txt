I cannot play music in the status "uploaded" in iTunes through iCloud (via Apple TV, iPhone, iPad) <body> I have a subscription to iTunes Match.  Recently, I think in the last week, I am not able to listen to the music that result in the status "Uploaded" , therefore is not matched.  Normally if I load a cd in my iTunes library (on my Mac) it sync with iCloud and I could have 2 status: Upload or Matched.   In the recent past I could play any song in either the two status with any device with the same Apple ID associated.  Now (in the last week) I cannot play anymore the pieces with the iCloud status "uploaded".  Is there anybody who had the same experience and who have solved the problem?
