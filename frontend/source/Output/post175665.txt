How to write a Q with a dot above, for differential notation? <body> I want to write a Q with a dot above. How can I make it happen? I need it in omni graffle.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yC4wQ.png" alt="enter image description here"  thanks.   <answer175668> strongQ̇/strong can be made a part of keyboard input using the replace.   Then when you type your chosen word it will be replaced with the strongQ̇/strong.   Here is a sample: I have chosen to call it qdot em(genius :)/em  You can find another strongQ̇/strong on the web and use it (Paste) instead.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/i4ON3.jpg" alt="qdot"  So now when ever you type "qdot" it will be replaced with your symbol. em(works in most applications)/em  <comment207257> What application are you using <comment207261> wow, nice solution. never used it. My list is totally empty, but now has Q̇ ... ups, can't write `q d o t` anymore :-) <comment207283> I thank you for asking this question and @buscar for answering it. I never quite thought of this situation before. It was very helpful. <comment207299> +1 from me - I simply *love* the text replace functionality; use it for a myriad things, from my email address to adding key command symbols in SE answers.
