rsync error: connection unexpectedly closed <body> I'm trying to backup some folders on an ubuntu server to an external G-Drive, connected through thunderbolt to my iMac, in this manner:  precode$ time nohup sh -c 'rsync -avz myuser@myserver:/home/user/ /Volumes/GDRIVE201501/userhome/ ' &gt; rsync-$(date '+%Y-%m-%d-%T').txt /code/pre  but the same problem persists:  precodeWrite failed: Broken pipe rsync: connection unexpectedly closed (10871596201 bytes received so far) [receiver] rsync error: error in rsync protocol data stream (code 12) at /SourceCache/rsync/rsync-42/rsync/io.c(452) [receiver=2.6.9] rsync: connection unexpectedly closed (568872 bytes received so far) [generator] rsync error: unexplained error (code 255) at /SourceCache/rsync/rsync-42/rsync/io.c(452) [generator=2.6.9] /code/pre  I tried changing the SSH configuration, like this:  precode$ vim ~/.ssh/config $ cat ~/.ssh/config Host *     ServerAliveInterval 120     TCPKeepAlive no  # ServerAliveInterval 60 /code/pre  and then restart the SSH:  precode$ sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh.plist  /code/pre  but that won't change anything. Suggestions?  <comment275626> Has the target run out of space? <comment275637> You may want to check [this answer](http://serverfault.com/a/526872) This should've been a comment, but my reputation is too low: sorry about this. <comment275749> No, I figured the solution. The Mac was set to go on computer sleep after 30 min. Changing this setting to never ended the problem with rsync.
