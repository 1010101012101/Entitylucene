Xcode not updated after updating through Mac App Store <body> I recently downloaded Xcode 6.1 from the Mac App Store and after downloading it, Xcode shows the version is still same as the old one (5.1).  When I go to the Mac App Store and search for Xcode, it shows version 6.1 and next to it is the button to open it. When I click open, it opens the old version of Xcode (5.1).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EQX2x.png" alt="Xcode splash screen showing version 5.1.1"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LNOvU.png" alt="Xcode on the Mac App Store"
