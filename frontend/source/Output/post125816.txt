Upgrading my 2007 iMac <body> I was considering purchasing a new Mac Mini as a way of upgrading my 2007 iMac.  If this is not possible, I'll probably just purchase a new iMac. Any suggestions would be appreciated.  <answer125819> You won't be abble to use the iMac as a screen.  The Target Display Mode is only supported by iMacs since the late 2009 models.   <answer125821> You cannot use the IMac as a direct screen but you can use Remote Desktop to access other machines e.g. the new Mac Mini.  Remote Desktop will be a slower screen and I think does not remote audio.  <comment147266> Are you hoping to use the iMac as a monitor for the mini? <comment147271> Yes, along with the mouse, keyboard and CD drive. <comment147272> Thank you. Looks like I'll need to purchase another iMac. <comment147276> Thanks, I'm satisfied now that a new iMac will be my best option. <comment147277> That was my decision in the same case <comment147478> Then mark the question as answered by ticking the checkmark on the left of my answer :)
