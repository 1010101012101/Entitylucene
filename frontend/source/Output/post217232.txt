Trying to force update_dyld_shared_cache but having some errors <body> I am trying to force the update of my dyld shared cache using the command  precodesudo update_dyld_shared_cache -root / -force /code/pre  But after a while I see a bunch of errors like this, related to codespindump/code:     update_dyld_shared_cache[719] : Unable to unlink //var/db/spindump/OLDDSC-E2D77243-3FD9-32E5-AE64-3506904D5579: 1 Operation not permitted   How do I fix this?  I am on El Capitan.  <answer217847> Reboot your mac in recovery mode (https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT201314), Open Terminal there and type   precoderm -rf /Volumes/&lt;your_system_volume&gt;var/db/spindump/* /code/pre  After that restart your mac and repeat the operation  precodesudo update_dyld_shared_cache -root / -force /code/pre  PS see detailed comment from @CharlieMonroe   <answer224114> What fixed it for me was  precodeupdate_dyld_shared_cache -debug /code/pre  This is what you should see  precodeupdate_dyld_shared_cache: adding root: /System/Library/... ... ... update_dyld_shared_cache: /var/db/dyld/dyld_shared_cache_i386 is up-to-date update_dyld_shared_cache: /var/db/dyld/dyld_shared_cache_x86_64 is up-to-date /code/pre  to be sure it works I run  precodeupdate_dyld_shared_cache  /code/pre  a second time  <comment264222> several things happened when I tried your commands. 1. I was denied the removal of spindump files with the message **sandbox: system police deny file write unlinke... bla bla**... yes, I am administrator and I have root access.  Trying the second command would give me the same errors. I still have the same files and I am still unable to update_dylid_shared_cache. <comment266462> The answer is almost right, but: `/` refers to the recovery volume, which is AFAIK read-only (it creates various RAM disks for RW stuff). Which is why the command fails, since you are trying to remove files from the recovery volume. The corrected command should look like this: `rm -rf /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/var/db/spindump/*`, `Macintosh\ HD` being an escaped name of your start-up drive. <comment266464> @CharlieMonroe you are right. I missed that thing in the path <comment271784> Those errors are logged for all updates - it's the old code fighting against SIP, but in practice, they seem harmless. Are you really looking to suppress the warnings or is there some failure relating to them you are trying to address? <comment271785> Aren't these files protected/restricted by SIP so efforts to remove them fail in recovery mode as they do when `update_dyld_shared_cache` tries to delete them? <comment308895> If your main volume has FileVault 2 enabled, you'll need to unlock it before you can access it in recovery mode. To do this, open Disk Utility, select the volume, and choose "Unlock" from Disk Utility's File menu. Once unlocked, it can be accessed until the next reboot.
