Delete Messages app <body> I have downloaded an app for Messages, and I'm wondering how to delete it. I don't see it on the iPhone.  <answer256475> If it's an app that's ONLY for Messages (meaning there's no supporting app that is accessible from outside Messages), you uninstall it by going into Messages, taping the A application icon, tapping the four bubbles in the bottom left corner, then swiping through pages until you find it. Press and hold on the app's icon and an X will appear. Tap the X to uninstall it.  If it's part of a larger iPhone app, for example a game that includes stickers, you would delete it by deleting the iPhone app itself.  <comment319955> thank you but I don't understand what you mean by "the A application icon" ? <comment319958> See screenshot: http://imgur.com/bUlwrqv
