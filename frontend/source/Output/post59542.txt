Reminders: Move list item to other list <body> is it possible to move a reminder from one reminders list to another?  For example I have two lists:  ol liToday/li liTomorrow/li /ol  How could I move for example "call cindy" from "Tomorrow" to "Today"?  <answer59548> Select the entry, right click, go to the "Move to List" menu entry, select the destination list you want.  (Or drag and drop.)  When I first tried this the difficult part was selecting the item rather than editing it...I needed to be sure to click white space off to the right of the title.  <answer80987> I foolishly tried dragging and dropping 5 items from one iCloud account to another.  Both lists bear the same title as shown in the Reminders app. Maybe that's why 4 items were deleted instead of moved.  Any way to restore the lost items from a Time Machine backup? I can't seem to find a .plist for Reminders in my Library.  <answer277489> The app should automatically transfer items from the 'Tomorrow' list to the 'Today' list at midnight.  It seems bogus that it doesn't.  <comment68586> Great answer, I guess this isn't possible on iOS? <comment68588> Sort of....  Tap a reminder and it brings up a dialog with a "Show More..." item.  Tap that and you can choose a list for that reminder.  (I'm on an iPad...don't know if it's similar for smaller devices.) <comment68601> @PhillipMills I can confirm that it's the same on my iPhone. <comment349251> Welcome to Ask Different.
