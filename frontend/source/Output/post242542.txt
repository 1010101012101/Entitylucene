Installing Ubuntu 16.04 server on Mac Mini 2006 <body> I have liberated an old 2006 Mac Mini (Model: A1176) from being thrown away and wanted to use it as a Time Capsule for my other Macs.  To do this, I want to install Ubuntu server 16.04 LTS to roll my own Time Capsule over my home network.  How can I do this? I have downloaded the ISO from Ubuntu's website but when I put it onto a CD-RW and selected it by holding down Option at boot, it then got stuck on the message 'Select CD-ROM Boot Type' with no way to select it (keyboard wasn't loaded).  Can someone please provide step-by-step on how to do this?  hr  strongUpdate/strong  To answer the comments. The Mac Mini currently has OS X 10.6.8 installed and has the 1.66GHz Intel Core Duo processor. It also has 1GB 667 MHz DDR2 SDRAM  The file I downloaded for Ubuntu was called codeubuntu-16.04-server-amd64.iso/code  The screenshot for the screen showing after I select the CD on the EFI menu is as follows:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3Bcqc.jpg" alt="screenshot"  I can't select an option as I don't think the keyboard is loaded.  <answer243084> Alright, I see you've added some requisites to your answer. Here goes.  h1strongPart 1/strong: strongInstall Ubuntu 16.04 Server/strong./h1  Download this. (Ubuntu Server 16.04 32-bit)  emThis is done the same way any other Linux install is done. You will insert the CD/DVD, run through the setup to take the entire partition of the Mac Mini, and once you reach a desktop, you're ready for part 2. [Excellent Basic Tutorial, 2012, but relevant]/em  h1strongPart 2/strong: strongGetting Time Machine Working within Linux Host/strong (Source)/h1  stronga. Choose a Data Folder/strong  First you need to pick a directory on your server for your Time Machine data and if it doesn't already exist, create it  I'll be using /data/timemachine/ for these instructions, if you prefer another location remember to change it in any of the following.  precodesudo mkdir -p /data/timemachine /code/pre  strongb. Setup a User Account/strong  You'll also need Time Machine user account on your server which you can log in with on your Mac. Create one and assign it the previously-created data folder as its home directory and assign ownership of that directory to this user.  I've chosen to create a user timemachine, but you can pick anything you like.  precodesudo adduser --home /data/timemachine timemachine   /code/pre  sudo chown -R timemachine:timemachine /data/timemachine  You'll also need to set the password for this user.  precodesudo passwd timemachine /code/pre  strongc. Configure Netatalk/strong  Next, you'll configure Netatalk. Open the existing afp.conf configuration file for editing that is stored in/etc/netatalk/. You can do it in the command line with:  precodesudo nano /etc/netatalk/afp.conf /code/pre  You can copy my sample configuration exerpt below, editing it to suit your setup. You simply add it to the end ofafp.conf when finished (and save).  precode[TimeMachine] # is this machine a time machine? time machine = yes # directory for time machine data on server path = /data/timemachine # the max size of the data folder (in Kb) vol size limit = 980000 # users with access to time machine valid users = timemachine /code/pre  strongd. Enable Netatalk &amp; Avahi/strong  Next, using the venerable systemd, you can enable the netatalk and avahi-daemon services:  precodesudo systemctl enable netatalk.service   /code/pre  sudo systemctl start netatalk.servicebr sudo systemctl enable avahi-daemon.servicebr sudo systemctl start avahi-daemon.service  Okay, now switch over to your Mac.  hr  h3Mac OS Setup/h3  By default Mac OS doesn't show "unsupported" or non-Apple Time Machine network drives, but you can easily change that with one Terminal command:  precodedefaults write com.apple.systempreferences TMShowUnsupportedNetworkVolumes 1 /code/pre  If everything went well after all this, you should now be able to choose your server in the Time Machine preferences when selecting a disk.  img src="https://samuelhewitt.com/images/blog/2015/09/timemachine-choose.png" alt=""  You'll also get a login prompt when attempting to access it, just use the username and password for the Time Machine account you created on your server.  If everything has worked thus far, and you are able to perform backups then congrats! You now have a Linux-powered Time Machine.  h1strongPart 3/strong: Getting the server to run headless on the Mini./h1  emYou will need a DVI to VGA adapter, as well as a VGA dummy to make the machine believe it is plugged into a monitor. The first time you do this, it will have a poor screen resolution. Please just remote into the box (Teamviewer, Logmein, etc) and change the resolution./em  h1strongPart 4/strong: strongGetting your files shared out of Linux Server/strong em(in this example below, it's Ubuntu, but instructions are relevant)/em.

I'm not tied down by what OS I use. <comment299192> Could you post a screenshot of the screen that says 'Select CD-ROM Boot Type'? And is your Mac Mini an early-2006, a mid-2006, or a late-2006? <comment299202> @Billy see updates to my question <comment299203> @DavidAnderson see updates to my question <comment299242> Does 14.04 support 32 bit? <comment299260> Basically, you are having the same problem as the question: [“Select CD-ROM Boot Type:” error during Windows install](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/172048/select-cd-rom-boot-type-error-during-windows-install). This explains what the problem is. This problem does not occur with the  32 bit version of Ubuntu 16.04 server. <comment299263> Just to let you know, your computer meets the recommended minimum [System Requirements](https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/preparing-to-install.html#system-requirements) for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS Server Edition. <comment299272> My next question would be: Do you intend to replace OS X with Ubuntu or do you want both operating systems? Also, It **may** be necessary to `bless` the computer before installing Ubuntu. If Ubuntu will not boot or is slow booting after installing, this may be the reason. <comment299282> @DavidAnderson I've downloaded 16.04 32-bit version and I'm giving it a go on the Mac Mini as we speak <comment299283> @DavidAnderson How do I bless the computer? I'd like to replace OSX completely and only run Ubuntu Server <comment299289> If you are installing Ubuntu to boot using a BIOS/MBR method, then you should first bless the computer to boot using this as the default method. It ***appears*** that this will be the method your version of Ubuntu will be using. The OS X Terminal application command would be `sudo  bless  --device  /dev/disk0  --legacy  --setBoot`. I would do this just before erasing OS X from your Mac. You can also enter the command by booting from a later OS X installation DVD. <comment299305> I would avoid Ubuntu and go with [FreeBSD](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/238487/119271)  I set up a Time Machine server quite easily with [these instructions](http://www.moeding.net/archives/23-Using-FreeBSD-as-Time-Machine-server.html).  It's infinitely easier, less overhead and basically the same kernel as OS X <comment299405> Ubuntu server installed successfully! However, it won't boot up without a display connected... My Mac Mini won't run headless <comment299422> @Jamesking56: I basically searched the internet and found the same solution as ThePCpenguin. This is more of a "Do It Yourself" answer. See [here](http://askubuntu.com/questions/505530/macmini-ubuntu-desktop-14-04-headless-boot-not-accessible-not-booting). Basically you are connecting a load from the RGB pins to the ground pins. This fools the Mac into thinking a monitor is attached. <comment299454> Do you know if it was necessary to bless the Mac in order for Ubuntu to correctly boot? <comment300059> @ThePCpenguin Thanks for updating your answer, it's a really concise answer and even notes about the Mini requiring a monitor (or dummy adapter). Really helpful thank you.
