Custom short commands to open apps <body> Is it possible to create custom short commands to run apps and open folders, to be called in Spotlight?  I mean, I'd like to create custom commands so I just open Spotlight (kbdâŒ˜/kbd + kbdspace/kbd) then run things like:  ul listrongcodec/codekbdEnter/kbd/strong to run code/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome/code/li listrongcodes/codekbdEnter/kbd/strong to run code/Applications/Safari.app/Contents/MacOS/Safari/code/li listrongcodeg/codekbdEnter/kbd/strong to run code/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --app="https://mail.google.com"/code/li listrongcodew/codekbdEnter/kbd/strong to run code/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --app="https://web.whatsapp.com"/code/li listrongcodework/codekbdEnter/kbd/strong to open the folder code/Users/myusername/Documents/workspace//code/li listrongcodeserv/codekbdEnter/kbd/strong to run something in the Terminal/li /ul  And so on... I think you know what I mean!  Thanks!  hr  emPS: I am coming from Windows, where I would: add a folder to the code%PATH%/code variable, throw shortcuts in this folder dragging and dropping icons with the right mouse button, then rename them shortcuts to the alias I want. Then it is just kbdWin/kbd+kbdR/kbd to run my stuff. Trying to figure out a equivalent on Mac. Adding a folder to code$PATH/code and creating executable scripts in it didn't work./em  <answer264555> Automator is what you want - for example, when you open automater, choose 'Folder Action' to set up an automation for your 'work' folder.  Some of it will require learning a bit of AppleScript.  <answer264557> Spotlight can't do this. You can probably hack something using AppleScript, Automator etc, but it might be easier to use Alfred which allows for this and a lot of other interesting things.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/D0sGJ.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  For your scenario it will actually learn which application you pick from the list and offer it as the default selection after a few times.  <comment332147> Thanks! I will prob give it a try but a native solution is what I was looking for, if there is any. <comment335288> Why the minus out of interest?
