Does the new Apple Photos app on the Mac download icloud photos without the application open? <body> I just started using the new Apple Photos app, after upgrading to yosemite. It's downloading all my photos i have from iCloud I have from my iPhone thus far. Will it continue downloading if i closed the Photos app on the mac?  <comment233579> and you do not want to try to find out :) <comment233581> There's `photolibraryd` daemon process running in OS X, so I think it is responsible for background synchronization. <comment233638> I'd say that iCloud Photo Library may exhibit different behavior than Photo Stream and it's reasonable to have some doubt otherwise, but having different behavior then imply Apple made a poor design which i guess is improbable. I'm convinced that downloads take place without the app open. Thanks.
