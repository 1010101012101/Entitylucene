Espresso Libre theme for MacVim? <body> I recently changed editors from TextMate to MacVim. Thanks in part to codevimtutor/code, things are going pretty well. But I miss the Espresso Libre color scheme:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cx6pC.png" alt="Espresso Libre Clone"  Is there a place where I can get Espresso Libre as a MacVim theme?  <answer7281> You'll probably be able to find something quite similar if not identical using vimcolorschemetest  <answer7761> If you have the TextMate theme file, you can use this online converter to spit out a (Mac)Vim theme file for you: http://coloration.sickill.net/  It should do a pretty good job of converting it for you, as it did for the ones I've tried.  <answer144183> This what you're looking for? http://eclipsecolorthemes.org/?view=theme&amp;id=45  <comment10202> this is exactly what I needed, thanks! <comment169887> That's for Eclipse, not MacVim.
