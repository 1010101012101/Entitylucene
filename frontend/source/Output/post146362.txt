Set Chrome to open PDF rather than download them <body> I'm a student and I'm constantly hoping up PDFs for homework. I often end up downloading multiple files after clicking on a link each time I start working. Is there any way to set Chrome to only open PDFs and not download them?  THanks  <answer146458> You will have to teach your Chrome how to Preview PDF's  For that you need to install a PDF preview "add on" in Chrome.     Automatically previews pdfs, powerpoint presentations, and other   documents in Google Docs Viewer.   <answer173339> In Google Chrome go to Settings. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click on the hyperlink for Show Advanced Settings. From there scroll down until you find the "Download" section. Uncheck the box where it asks where to save each file before downloading. Close Chrome and reopen. You should now be able to have the PDF open without prompting to save it.  <answer230963> I don't have the "whether to save each file before downloading" question on advanced settings - only where to save the file. However - I find that if I click on a pdf and chrome asks where to save it, if I say "cancel" and then click the pdf again it simply shows it with downloading it! Hope this helps.  <answer233226> Go to the url codechrome://plugins/code in chrome, then find and enable codeChromium PDF Viewer/code.  This will tell Chrome to use its built-in PDF viewer instead of downloading.  After this is enabled, to download PDFs, just press kbdcommand/kbd+kbdS/kbd.  <answer236609> I fixed this problem by going to Chrome://extensions Because I have Adobe Acrobat installed on my computer, the extension was present, but defaulted to 'disabled'. Toggling to 'enabled' now triggers a pop-up when clicking pdf links, to 'Open in Acrobat'  <answer268366> Go to emChromeSettingsAdvanced SettingsContent SettingsPDF Documents/em.   Deselect the option emOpen PDF files in the default PDF viewer/em  <answer274092> Within Chrome, do this:  ul liChrome.app  Chrome (menu)  Preferences/li liSettings  + Show advanced settings (text link)  Content Settings (button)/li /ul  Then scroll down to strongPDF Documents/strong and check: strongOpen PDF files in the default PDF viewer application application/strong.  <comment238770> On the newest version (44) that doesn't work. All it does is automatically save to the default location, which is the Downloads folder. <comment285060> We are looking for longer answers with more detail.
