Volume doesn't work in Macbook air <body> I have an 11-inch MacBook Air from 2015. Today, I was using my laptop. The sound worked perfectly fine until the following afternoon, when there was this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/POkRn.png" alt="piture"  I went into system preferences, and there isn't any output devices connected to mine that are shown. Headphones didn't work either.  I tried an "SMC reset" as shown on the Apple website, but it didn't resolve the issue.  According to what I read, if the headphone port is clogged or something, there should be a red light at the port. There weren't any red lights, and headphones didn't work.  Can you help me with this?  (also, my computer's fans are also going on for no reason, even though the only thing i use is google chrome and imovie)  FYI:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eDvBA.png" alt="System Information"
