How to Remove iOS dev/IDE/... from Xcode? <body> I need space in my SSD. I just need terminal tools in OS X El-capitan, not the Xcode IDE, not iOS, ... The space 10.49 Gb is just too much in my 60 GB disk partition. These PATHs do not work anymore so I cannot delete them  ul licode~/Library/Developer/Xcode/iOS DeviceSupport//code/li licode~/Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator/code/li li.../li /ul  hr  How can you remove iOS/IDE/... from Xcode?  <answer240448> Delete the Xcode app from code/Applications/code, then delete code~/Library/Developer/Xcode/code.  You can then install the command line tools separately, by downloading them from Apple's Developer Downloads page (you'll need to log in with your Apple ID). The proper package is listed as "Command Line Tools (OS X version) for Xcode version". Obviously grab the one that applies to your current version of OS X.  <comment295530> Could you just delete the entire program and then reinstall just the CLI tools. http://osxdaily.com/2014/02/12/install-command-line-tools-mac-os-x/ <comment295538> That's the right package. I didn't add it to the edit since the image link was broken, but added a description of what to look for. That particular script is out of date, but my Github is https://github.com/robmathers and has that and other small projects.
