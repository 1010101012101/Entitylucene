What version of Mac Mini supports Leopard 10.5.8? <body> Does Leopard 10.5.8 support the first-ever Mac Mini (M9686*/A, M9687*/A, I think)?  Or do I need one of the later ones?  I'm buying my first-ever mac this Christmas.  <answer4402> Yes Leopard supports all Intel and all PowerPC based machines over a minimum CPU speed and the original Power PC minus are in that ranges. Apple doc  Snow Leopard (10.6) only supports Intel based machines  <comment4212> If you are going to get your first-ever Mac, do your best to get an Intel Mac (Mac Mini or whatever), If you get a Power PC, you may find yourself limited, and it will slowly get worse with time, since Apple no longer uses PowerPC.
