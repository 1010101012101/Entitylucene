iPod touch 4 doesn't connect to WIFI <body> The following bug is something that started occurring today...  Whenever I try to connect to any WIFI network (routers, mobile hotspots), I can see my iPod tries to connect, but instantly loses connection. When I try to do this manually, it connects but immediately shows a screen with address http://www.apple.com, the title of the screen is "Log In" and the screen contains:   precode&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;&lt;TITLE&gt;Success&lt;/TITLE&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;&lt;BODY&gt;Success&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt; /code/pre  The only thing I can do is press Cancel in the right top corner... My ipod runs on iOS version 6.0.1.  <answer196038> I had the same problem this morning and it was solved by turning off the auto connection and auto log in.  <answer196039> Yeah auto-login was somehow turned on for me. Once I turned it off it worked.  <answer196120> 1.) Go to SETTINGS next to your networks name there's a blue arrow click on that.  2.) Now turn ON auto-join  3.) Turn OFF auto-log in  4.) It Works!  <comment234078> Where can I find this setting? I have autoconnect off but can't find any autologin settings..
