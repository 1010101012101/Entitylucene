Why isn't finder finding all files? <body> I had a Smart Search for my Photo Stream files located at code~/Library/Application Support/iLifeAssetManagement/assets/sub//code, searching for JPG and PNG files. I found that not all files were showing up. So I went looking for them myself and was able to locate them.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dLECY.png" alt="enter image description here"  How does this make sense? Why doesn't finder see the same results? The list of files was achieved using the find command at the prompt. I then passed a simple find result to wc to get the count, 153 files found via find in Terminal but only 75 in Finder using Spotlight? What's the deal?  <answer57166> I'm not exactly clear on what you mean by "Smart Search". I'm assuming you're referring to a "Smart Folder", which allows you to specify and save Spotlight search criteria?   In Lion a Smart Folder with saved Spotlight criteria will show up in Finder as a folder with a gear icon. Smart Folders show up in code~/Library/Saved Searches//code with an extension of code.savedSearch/code, which are actually preference lists holding aliases that create a virtual folder.  Looking at your screen capture it doesn't appear you're using a Smart Folder. Another observation is that your Finder search shows the files in the codesub/code directory, where in Terminal you are drilling further down. Since it appears to be a standard Spotlight search it makes perfect sense why you're not seeing the same results in Finder and Terminal.   By default Spotlight does not index or search System folders, which includes the Library folder that you're searching. To resolve the inconsistency here's what you need to do:  In Finder navigate to:  ol li~/Library/Application Support/iLifeAssetManagement/assets/sub//li liIn the codesub/code window click inside the search box and hit kbdoption/kbd kbdreturn/kbd/li licodeSearch: This Mac/code | codesub/code should appear just below/li liClick codesub/code and then code+/code on the right side/li liFrom the dropdown menu that appears select codeKind/code is codeImage/code  codeAll/code/li liClick the codesave/code button on the right and name it./li /ol  If you still aren't getting the same search results vs. Terminal then look through the search criteria options (code+/code) to make adjustments. Hopefully this helped you, and/or anyone else that needs to setup a "smart search".  <answer57167> It might be necessary to rebuild the Spotlight database by running  precodesudo mdutil -E / /code/pre  and waiting a few hours. I had the same issue in the past and rebuilding the index resolved it.  <answer80143> I have this all the time...  Manual search or saved search shows:  ul liIMG_4668.JPG/li liIMG_4663.JPG/li liIMG_4662.JPG/li liIMG_4661.JPG/li /ul  and in the /assets/sub folder I see strongall/strong the files. (including IMG_4664/5/6/7.JPG etc)  After running the following command everything is fine but it will take only a week or so before it's messed up again.   precodesudo mdutil -E / /code/pre  Same applies to the ~/Library/Mobile Documents/ folder.  Multiple tests on other folders are succesfull. Just not the results for these 2 folders that both happen (?) to be under ~/Library/   Old Macbook and my new (freshly installed) Macbook: same issue  <answer280287> This is what worked for me:  Go into System Preferences  Spotlight "Privacy" tab. Press the "+" button at the bottom and add the volume you are trying to search. This will remove the volume from search results. Then click the "-" button to remove the volume you just added. This will reindex the volume that is having problems.   Try your search again. If you're in the same situation I was in, this should work.  <comment65640> Have you excluded some folders from spotlight indexing? That might explain it. <comment65641> Spotlight does index files located in System folders, but normally leaves them out of search results. <comment65791> Yes, sorry I meant Smart Folder. I had removed and re-created it multiple times while troubleshooting which is why you do not see it in this shot. <comment65792> Regarding the search location, there was no difference, if I ran `pwd` on that prompt in Terminal you would see I was in the sub folder, pretty sure @patrix is correct about the cacheing. <comment65794> Rebuilding the index using `sudo mdutil -E /` fixed the issue. Thanks!
