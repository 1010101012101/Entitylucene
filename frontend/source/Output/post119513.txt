Rip CD to FLAC on Mavericks <body> I have a large collection of Audio CDs I would like to convert to audio files. My requirements are:  ul liFLAC and MP3 support: I would like to keep a lossless version of the CDs in original quality./li liCDDB / MusicBrainz connectivity: I would like to have the track and album filenames downloaded from the net, rather than type them manually./li liOSX Mavericks compatibility/li liReasonable GUI/li /ul  Is there a good application for that, preferably using an open-source one?  <answer119517> X Lossless Decoder, Max. Both open source and for mac.   <comment139394> Do you want to rip your Audio CDs *into* FLAC files, do you just want to playback FLAC files or do you have FLAC files you want to convert into something playable by iTunes <comment139395> I would like to convert my Audio CDs to FLAC files on the mac Hard drive, and I don't want iTunes to be involved. Edited my question accordingly. <comment139397> You may also check out [FFMPEG](http://www.ffmpeg.org), a command line tool for converting nearly every audio and video file. Cheers! <comment139401> xld works fine, thanks. Max is a little outdated (last updated in 2009). <comment139402> Yes, you're right. :) <comment139406> Why the downvote? <comment139409> I didn't do that ... <comment185447> Max still working well here, X Lossless Decoder looks a bit command-line for my liking
