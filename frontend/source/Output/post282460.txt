Why do I get a 'connection to the outgoing server "smtp.gmail.com" failed' message in iOS Mail? <body> Today I noticed I have 3 emails stuck in my Outbox, and when I try to re-send one, I see:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HRLuo.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  If I press strongSettings/strong, then select "SMTP  Gmail SMTP Server", and "Gmail SMTP Server" (under PRIMARY SERVER--it is the only one shown as "On"), I see:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FrVU2.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  I can't edit anything here.  Has Gmail changed the way their SMTP authentication works? How do I fix this?  <answer282571> I occasionally get a call from a client of mine complaining about this.  I don't know of an actual fix (or what the actual problem is) but I usually recommend doing these in order:  ol liQuit Mail fully: double-tap the home button, swipe up on Mail/li liNormal restart: press and hold power until you get the option to shut off, wait 30s for it to shut off, press and hold power until the Apple logo shows up again./li liTry again and if it fails, forced restart: press and hold power AND the home button until it shuts off - keep holding until the apple logo shows up again/li liRemove and re-add the gmail account./li /ol  <comment355857> Have you ruled out a hostile network blocking smtp ? <comment355949> I think I have ruled out a network blocking SMTP, since I have the problem at home and at work on WiFi, as well as over LTE. <comment356103> #1 worked for me. Which leads me to believe it's a Mail.app bug.
