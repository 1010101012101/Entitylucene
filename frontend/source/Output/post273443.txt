Terminal bash completion doesn't autocomplete for java <body> I have been using bash-completion perfectly fine for a while, but starting today the behavior is not working for the codejava/code command.   Typing in codejava ex/code and trying to autocomplete to codeexample/code for instance, will just produce the beeping error sound when there is no ambiguity. I've installed bash completion via brew (codebrew install bash-completion/code) and have the following in my code.bash_profile/code:  precodeif [ -f `brew --prefix`/etc/bash_completion ]; then . `brew --prefix`/etc/bash_completion fi  /code/pre  My codejavac/code is working fine though, and it completes to the source code, codeexample.java/code even if there is a codeexample.class/code.
