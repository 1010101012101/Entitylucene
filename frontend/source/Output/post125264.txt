Programs keeps asking for iCloud password when I log in <body> Whenever I log in a window appears, looks like an Apple program from the icon style displayed in the window, and asks for my iCloud password.  I don't remember installing the program, ever using it, or adding it to my login items. I can in fact not see any to me unknown program in my login items.  What is it?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KeBhd.png" alt="enter image description here"  (I made my iCloud user name invisible to the casual observer.)  <comment181993> The icon is for Messages, which comes with OS X. Look at your Dock and I'm willing to bet it's there and set to run at login. <comment182201> No, there was nothing in the Dock and it wasn't set to run at login.
