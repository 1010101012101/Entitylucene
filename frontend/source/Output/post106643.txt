How to unmount a locked volume? <body> Sometimes, a volume refuses to eject because some program is using them.  Sadly, Finder doesn't give the identity nor gives a way to solve the problem.  So, how do you solve this problem in a clean way, without using a terminal ?  Using the terminal, I may find a way to eject it, but it's not reliable.  codesudo lsof | grep volumeName/code certainly gives some information, but I don't feel like killing random processes in order to unmount a volume. Also, not everybody is willing to run command in a terminal.  I also don't want to force eject the volume. I think we shouldn't have to force the ejection when we didn't initially run the program that locks the volume.  Processes that are frequently involved are: codemds/code and codenotifyd/code.  Killing codemds/code does not guarantee that the ejection of the volume will be possible. codemds/code process is respawned after getting killed, and continues preventing the ejection of the drive.  I also noticed that codemds/code can be running and using files, and still not preventing the ejection of the volume, so I'm not even sure that it's codemds/code fault.  <answer106798> I've found this solution that has worked reliably several times already today.   The process that, in my case, was responsible for the failure of the ejection was:  codeSystemUIS/code (as seen in codetop/code in a terminal) which is in fact codeSystemUIServer/code.  Here is how to kill it without a terminal: run Activity Monitor, find codeSystemUIServer/code (type UI in the top right search field), and stop it with the top left button (stop button).  <comment125184> Running `lsof` and then killing any troublesome processes actually *is* the canonical way to solve this problem (and all the tools which allow you to force-eject a drive do this as well), so I'm a bit unclear about what kind of problem you are trying to solve here. Can you please try to frame your question a bit more specifically? <comment125188> @patrix I doubt every Mac user is going to launch a terminal and begin typing in it. Are non technical users forced to do a force eject and possibly corrupt data on the volume ? <comment125197> Technically there is no other way, besides waiting for the blocking processes to finish (which may be never) or a system reboot (which will kill the processes as well).
