Open new Terminal in same SSH session <body> Is there a way to open a new Terminal in an existing SSH session?  I am logged into a remote system and have a special session that I have to request and wait to receive.  I know I can then use the "xterm &amp;" command to open multiple xterm windows within that session, but xterm behaves differently from OSX's built-in Terminal.  Is there a way to open multiple Terminal windows within the existing SSH session?  <answer267794> Yes, you can reuse exiting ssh connection and open ssh in whatever terminal you like. See this answer to a StackOverflow question for details:     If you open the first connection with -M:  precodessh -M $REMOTEHOST /code/pre      subsequent connections to $REMOTEHOST will "piggyback" on the   connection established by the master ssh. Most noticeably, further   authentication is not required. See man ssh_config under   "ControlMaster" for more details. Use -S to specify the path to the   shared socket; I'm not sure what the default is, because I configure   connection sharing using the configuration file instead.      In my .ssh/config file, I have the following lines:  precodehost *   ControlMaster auto   ControlPath ~/.ssh/ssh_mux_%h_%p_%r /code/pre      This way, I don't have to remember to use -M or -S; ssh figures out if   a sharable connection already exists for the host/port/username   combination and uses that if possible.   <comment335582> tmux is available through homebrew haven't used it myself tho... https://tmux.github.io/
