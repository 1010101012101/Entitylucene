MacBook Pro Boots to a circle with a line through it <body> My MBP boots-up to only a circle with a line through it.  I have no idea what this means.  It will not let me go into emsingle-user mode/em or emrecovery mode/em.  I'm assuming everything is gone.  I don't have the disks that came with it.  I don't know OS X, can someone help me and tell me how to fix it?  <comment312968> Do you mean it displays what is the called the "Prohibitory symbol", as described on this Apple Support page? https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204156 <comment312970> @gentlemanhog just pointed out your answer.  good work! <comment312971> @fbara - it might be the answer on a newer Mac, but on an 09 the simplest fix is 'take it to an Apple Store' - it doesn't have Internet Recovery & the OP said he'd already tried Recovery. <comment312973> @Tetsujin I was referring to the OP's question about what that icon meant and not how to fix it. <comment312974> I'm pretty sure the official designation of the Prohibitory Symbol was not the OP's prime motive for asking the question ;) <comment312978> @Tetsujin I was just trying to clarify what the OP saw.
