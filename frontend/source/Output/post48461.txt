The codeSharing &amp; Permissions/code is codeYou can only read/code.  Does anyone know how to modify this permission?  <answer48463> OS X can't write to NTFS natively - you'll need to install a package like MacFuse/NTFS-3G or Tuxera NTFS to write to NTFS partitions.  From the BootCamp Apple Support KB:     During installation, the Microsoft Windows installer asks me to format   the Windows partition using NTFS or FAT. Which should I use?      If the partition is 32 GB or smaller, you can use either FAT or NTFS.   If it's larger than 32 GB, or you are installing Microsoft Vista, then   you can only format it using NTFS. strongMac OS X can read and write FAT   volumes, but only read NTFS volumes./strong Refer to the Microsoft Windows   documentation if you are not sure which best suits your needs.   <comment55517> What format is this drive in? NTFS, HFS, etc.? <comment55519> NTFS... The disk can be written under Ubuntu/Windows automatically... <comment55520> By default, NTFS disks are read only in OS X without additional software. <comment55521> Short answer - OS X can't write to NTFS partitions without installing an additional package (see my answer below).
