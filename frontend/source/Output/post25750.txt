Where are the default (system) wallpaper folders located on OS X? <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   Where are Apple&#39;s default desktop images stored?       Does anybody know where the folders containing the default (i.e. system) wallpapers are located on OS X Lion? (it may not have changed from previous versions of OS X, so please also tell me if you know where they are on a previous version of OS X). Thanks!  [EDIT:] Indeed, a dupe. What threw me off was that I was looking for "Wallpaper", not "Desktop Pictures". Maybe add a tag synonym [wallpaper] for [desktop], to aid searching people who make the same mistake.   <answer25751> Its on:  code/Library/Desktop Pictures//code  Notice though this is the strongsystem library/strong, not the user library, so its right on the root of the drive and not inside your user folder.  Its hidden by default. Go to terminal and type codeopen /Library/code to open it.  Hope it helps!  hr  strongEdit:/strong On Finder, you can hit kbdCMD/kbdkbdShift/kbdkbdG/kbd and paste the path to go to the folder. (thanks Sjoerd)  <comment29219> I used CMD+Shift+G to paste the path there... also works fine. Thanks! I was aware of the now-hidden-by-default Library folders, I must have been looking right past it a couple of times... :) <comment29328> Haha right. Cmd+Shift+G! Sorry, I'm a Terminal kind of person :P Your welcome! Glad it helped. <comment266550> If you cannot remember arcane incantations like CMD-Shift-G, you can instead look in the Finder's **Go** menu.
