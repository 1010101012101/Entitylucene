Weird location issue on iPad 3(cellular) <body> I have an iPad 3 cellular model running iOS  9.3.5. I recently noticed that apps are not able to fetch location. Now,  ol liLocation Services are turned ON for all apps I could find in the list. /li liRestrictions are turned OFF./li liI have tried rebooting, factory resetting and they did not fix the issue./li /ol  Also, even though I have turned ON the Status Bar Icon for Location Services, it never shows up when I open up any app. I have tried using Google Maps,Apple Maps. Both of them failed to get my location. Any Suggestions??
