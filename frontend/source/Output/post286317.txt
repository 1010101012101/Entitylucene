Simulate a 13 inch display on 15 inch MacBook Pro <body> Is there any way to simulate a 13 inch display on a 15 inch MacBook Pro? Some tool that would resize all windows, the dock and menu to take up less space? Reason is I am thinking of buying a 13 inch MacBook Pro and want to see how it is working with a smaller screen.  <answer286318> Take a screenshot, change your desktop picture to just black. Use qucklook &amp; drag the screenshot smaller.   <comment361215> Tools of choice for the task at hand: Hammer or chainsaw. <comment361219> Not a bad suggestion. But I'd still like to actively experience using a computer with a smaller amount of screen space, if possible. <comment361310> Why not go into a store and use one for 15 minutes? No one is going to kick you off if you're a genuine potential buyer. <comment361442> @mada.eve Oh I have, but I want to try it out with my own applications and general setup.
