How do I get back into my Mac when the no entry sign is there every time I try booting it up? <body> I recently added Windows 10 to my Mac using Boot Camp. In the process of installation I think I might have accidentally deleted the Mac file. My Windows 10 works fine but I can't get back into my mac because it shows the no entry signal. Anyone have a way to fix this?  <comment336299> What have you tried so far? What happens if you press the Option (or Alt) key when starting up?
