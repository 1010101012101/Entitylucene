File contents remains in terminal after exiting Vim? <body> I'm using the stock terminal with zsh and vim. After I exit vim, the file contents remains in the terminal. Ideally, only the previous history would be in the terminal when I exit vim (such as the behavior I've seen with linux/bash).   How can I accomplish that?  strongUpdate/strong  I'm running os x Yosemite 10.10.1  I tried glenn jackman's suggestion below, but still no dice.   Additional information:  codeecho $TERM/code produces codeansi/code  I also tried in bash with the same results.   I also tried removing code.vimrc/code completely with the same results.   <answer168871> Try adding:  precodeif &amp;term =~ "xterm"     let &amp;t_ti = "\&lt;Esc&gt;[?47h"     let &amp;t_te = "\&lt;Esc&gt;[?47l" endif /code/pre  to your code~/.vimrc/code  Ref: https://forums.vandyke.com/showthread.php?t=3431  <answer169148> I figured it out:  Similar to glenn jackman's solution, I added   precodeif &amp;term =~ "ansi"     let &amp;t_ti = "\&lt;Esc&gt;[?47h"     let &amp;t_te = "\&lt;Esc&gt;[?47l" endif /code/pre  to my code.vimrc/code file (notice the codeansi/code instead of codexterm/code).   This fixed the issue.   <comment198271> Weird. On my Lion system, running vim under zsh nets the usual exit, i.e., the file contents are not visible. <comment198582> Try setting `TERM=xterm` in the shell before opening vim.
