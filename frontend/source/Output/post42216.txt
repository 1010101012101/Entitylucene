How to restore iTunes DVD backup to v10.5 <body> I had an old mac mini die on me, so new machine has itunes 10.5. I backed up the old machine itunes library on DVD, using the backup functionality in itunes. There is no restore from dvd option in 10.5. How do I recover my music ? This seems idiotic to not support restoring from dvd in the new product. Fine, get rid of backup, but at least allow restore.  <answer42219> Open iTunes then select File  Add to Library. Select your files and click open.  You also should be able to put your Library in code/Music/iTunes/iTunes Music/code. Or, just put the library somewhere in your code/Music/code folder and select File  Preferences  Advanced (tab), then under iTunes Media folder location click Change, and find the folder that you have your library in.
