How can I type unicode characters without using the mouse? <body> I want to type unicode characters with the keyboard.  I'm looking for a solution with strongno mouse usage/strong.  For example, below I have a line with the unicode "PILE-OF-POO" character:    The codepoint for PILE OF POO is U+1F4A9 and on a linux operating system I can create this character by typing:  kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbdu/kbd,  kbd1/kbd,  kbdf/kbd,  kbd4/kbd,  kbda/kbd,  kbd9/kbd  kbdspace/kbd  How can I do something similar on a mac keyboard?  Other answers I've searched involve fiddling with menus and switching input sources.    <answer183056> U+1F4A9 converts to d83d dca9 in unicode hex input, which is what OS X uses as an official input source across the OS.  To use the keyboard directly with their code numbers, first enable Unicode Hex Input in System Preferences - Keyboard - Input Sources. Then, each time you wish to use that input method, switch to the Unicode Hex layout (this can be done via a keyboard shortcut that by default conflicts with spotlight) and then hold the option/alt modifier while you type the the utf-16 hex codes you wish (which is really two hex codes for characters beyond the Unicode BMP, such as 1f4a9, which is represented by d83d dca9).  kbdoption/kbd held down then kbdd/kbd, kbd8/kbd, kbd3/kbd,  kbdd/kbd,  kbdd/kbd,  kbdc/kbd,  kbda/kbd,  kbd9/kbd  A which point, you will have summoned   Not much fun to type.  If you have a finite number of such characters you want to make, you can set up keyboard shortcuts for them in system prefs/keyboard/text in the substitutions table.  <answer275053> Hard to find in Sierra. In System Preference, select Keyboard, then select InputSources. The left hand pane will show your preferred language keyboard, and possibly alternates. If Unicode Hex Input is not there, click the + button beneath; you will get a long list of languages. Scroll to the very bottom and choose others. Unicode Hex Input will appear in the right pane, then click the Add button, bottom right.  Tab over to Shortcuts and choose the shortcut key. Alt+Space and Cmd+Space may already be taken by Spotlight. Either disable them, or reassign by clicking at the right-hand end of the column and typing your new key. I left them as they were and assigned Ctrl+Space for Input sources. If you do that, now when you type Ctrl+space, you will see the little flag, top right of the menu bar change to a U+. You can then enter your hex codes (which you can find out from the Emoji &amp; Character Viewer) by holding Alt while you type the numbers. Eg, At2282 produced the Set member symbol ⊂.  <answer293124> Press CTRL+CMD+space to bring up the characters popover.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YHiMM.jpg" alt="Open character popover"  Then type in the code point and press the down arrow to select the symbol.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/C7tPf.png" alt="Type in code point"  Then simply press ENTER and you are done.  This also works with the names of the symbols (e.g. arrow).  <comment218106> substitutions could be an acceptable workaround.  I tried setting up a substitution for pileofpoo -  , but it isn't doing anything.  Could you add more details of how/where this is supposed to work? <comment218287> No, trying in text boxes in the browser, in jetbrains IDE , in the built-in terminal app, sublime text ... not working in any of those <comment218292> Can you input that character using the Character Viewer in those apps? <comment218295> Test of your shortcut using my Safari browser, which has Substitutions in the Edit menu:    Perhaps those apps do not yet support Apple's substitutions system?  Or the color emoji font? <comment218298> It works in Safari browser.  When I type `pileofpoo space` it was automatically changed to the unicode character.  Unfortunately, **a solution that only works in Apple's applications is not an acceptable solution**.  Ideally it should be system-wide but at the very least, I would like it in the terminal and my browser (Chrome). <comment218314> Perhaps a 3rd party text expander like Typeit4me would work with all apps.  But not all apps are guaranteed to support color emoji. <comment249729> If you don't enable unicode hex input, you get `∂•£∂∂çåª` output.  @bmike your edits are confusing the post a bit and should be reordered. <comment317640> For those not familiar with using the surrogate characters (UTF-16), the conversion is like this:      1f4a9 - f4a9 - 03d,0a9 - d800+03d,dc00+0a9 - d83d,dca9     Subtract 0x10000, High/Low ten bits, Add Hi/Lo surrogate bases <comment353553> When adding the input source, after pressing the + at the bottom of the screen instead of scrolling to the bottom you can enter "unicode" in the search field and it should show you the Unicode Hex Input as a result.  Confirmed to work on macOS 10.12 <comment369871> I don't think this will work if you normally have the expanded version of the Character Viewer active.  You have to use the mouse to get back to the small one you are showing.  Or is there a keyboard shortcut to do that? <comment369980> That's right, this only works with the popover variant not the bigger window. <comment370171> How do you get the popover variant?  Is there something similar on IOS?  Having frequently used right at the top is great. <comment370177> @WGroleau To get the popover, you click on the small icon in the top right corner of the expanded version. For iOS I think you could use an app like Unicode Pad  https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/unicode-pad/id374098312?mt=8 <comment370232> Would be nice if it would show the code value, like IPA Palette https://www.blugs.com/IPA/ does
