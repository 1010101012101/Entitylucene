How do I get iMessage to work on my iPod Touch 5th gen? <body> I've tried everything people have said and I just can't figure it out. It says I'm logged in but when I try to send a message, it says not delivered. My wifi connection is good and I've tried everything ! I just don't know what to do , please help me   <comment171108> If you haven't already, go to settings and log out of iMessage and then log back in.  I had this happen with an iPad and that's all I had to do.
