iPhone - add email account just for sending <body> I have several email accounts that I just use for sending mail, not receiving (received mail gets forwarded to other addresses).  I would like to be able to send from these address on my iPhone.  When I add a mail account on my iPhone, though (iOS 8.1), it appears I can't send from the address unless I'm also downloading mail for that account on my phone, which I don't want.  Does anyone know of a way to add an email account to the iPhone in such a way that it's just an extra "send from" address, as opposed to downloading the mail for the account?  If this can't be done with the built-in Mail app, I'd be open to suggestions for alternative apps that do provide this functionality (I couldn't find any).  Thanks!  <comment198285> Note: I've seen [this question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/26105/111030) but the answers aren't elegant and might be out of date <comment198378> but surely if those addresses automatically forward mail, then there would be nothing to download? or perhaps you need to implement some server side rules regarding your mail <comment198380> Well, the addresses are forwarding mail but also keeping a copy on the server.  Not your everyday setup but it does make sense in my use case!
