How to find out which Safari tab is using massive memory? <body> As described in my other question, Safari on OS X 10.6. is causing me massive problems (with my way of working like having many tabs in Safari open for a long time).

Sort by name      View by memory usage   You should see individual Safari pages memory consumption.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1NjnI.png" alt="enter image description here"  By hovering pointer over one will show the web site name.  The memory consumption will depend on the web site it self, its design, the complexity, and multimedia usage.  <comment146598> Of interest might be [How can I figure out which tab in Safari is using CPU?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/45768/) and [Safari using too much RAM](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2910/) <comment146599> Apart from the general case in the duplicate which seems to have no answer also see this [answer](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/4131/237) which suggests Flash is the main culprit <comment146607> @mark. I should have thanked you for the link. Cross linking in comments is excellent whether they are dupe or not. I'll clean up the comments here once we get the links reworded <comment146641> I'm using OS 10.6.8 - are you sure that I can list the memory consumption of single safari tabs there also? <comment314454> This seems to be incorrect for at least 10.8 and older; please add what version this works on.
