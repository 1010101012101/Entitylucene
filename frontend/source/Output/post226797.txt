Identify Certificate Authority from public key <body> Under OS X, the code/usr/local/etc/openssl/cert.pem/code contains many certificates in this format:  precode----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----  &lt;...snip..&gt; ----END CERTIFICATE----- /code/pre  In Ubuntu, in code/etc/ssl/certs/code, each certificate is in its own file; with the files named like codeVisa_eCommerce_Root.pem/code, codeSwisscom_Root_CA_1.pem/code etc.  I was wondering if on OS X there is a way I can get similar names for each certificate contained in the codecert.pem/code file?  PS. The context is that I am trying to debug an issue on OS X where some SSL connections fail, but when I import all the .pem files from Ubuntu into OS X, the SSL connection works. I wanted to identify which certificate is missing on OS X.  <answer226798> In OS X you can inspect all the system root certificates by doing the following:  ol liPress codecmd + spacebar/code and then type "keychain access" followed by codereturn/code./li liSelect "System Roots" and "Certificates" in the left side pane./li /ol  You should now see all the root certs installed and used by OS X e.g.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bxHhR.png" alt="enter image description here"  You should be able to compare this list to the list of certs installed on your Ubuntu box.  PS: You can parse the codecert.pem/code certificate via codeopenssl x509 -text -noout &lt; /usr/local/etc/openssl/cert.pem/code. This won't give you a list of roots though, just a single cert (whose purpose I am unsure of).  <comment275409> `just a single cert (whose purpose I am unsure of).` It's just the first cert in the bundle. Nothing special about it. OpenSSL is peculiar that way. <comment275410> If you want to explode the pem-bundle into individual members, you can you use my [small bash script from a previous answer.](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/108517/should-i-be-concerned-that-google-no-longer-trusts-specific-symantec-root-ca-cer) <comment275510> Try to explode the PEM bundle in to separate PEM files with the [method I listed for a different question.](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/108517/should-i-be-concerned-that-google-no-longer-trusts-specific-symantec-root-ca-cer) And then just grep over the files.
