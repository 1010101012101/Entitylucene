Is it safe to delete ~/Library/Graphics <body> When I was deleting Java from my Mac I found a folder in Library (not root), I found a folder called Graphics and in that contained another folder called "Quartz Composer Plug-Ins" which had no file in it. So, should I delete it or not?  PS. I am just worried if it some sort of malware or useless file.  <answer295793> It is not malware! The folder is part of macOS. So no need to remove it.     Quartz Composer is a node-based visual programming language provided as part of the Xcode development environment in macOS for processing and rendering graphical data.       Apple has embedded Quartz technologies deeply into the operating system.
