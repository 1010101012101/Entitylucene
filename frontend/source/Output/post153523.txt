Resizing dual boot partitions in Yosemite <body> I have a dual boot Macbook Air with Yosemite and Ubuntu. I would like more space on my Ubuntu partition and need to therefore reduce the size of the Mac partition. I assume this will cause some damage to my Mac HD but I'm completely fine with that. The question however is; how in the world can we do this properly? The terminal diskutil gives me a very reasonable overview of the size of the complete HD and the partitions. iPartition for some reason spits out the unexplainable 85 gb as a current size and Macintosh's pride GUI the Disk Utility also is a bit out in the blue when it comes to what is actually on the total hard drive and how this is partitioned:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Jb408.png" alt="Disk usage according to different sources"  Also, adding the values of the independent disks doesn't total the space on the top disk. (Macintosh HD (91.4 gb) + disk0s4 (29.1 gb) is more than the selected disk's (also) 91.4 gb). In Maverick, partitioning with the Disk Utility used to be a dream, but now everything is locked and no button can be clicked anymore. I really need more space on my ubuntu partition, so what am I to do?  EDIT:  The terminal output reads the following:  precode$ diskutil list /dev/disk0    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *121.3 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:          Apple_CoreStorage                         91.4 GB    disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3    4:       Microsoft Basic Data                         29.1 GB    disk0s4 /dev/disk1    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD           *91.0 GB    disk1                                  Logical Volume on disk0s2                                  4F26F5C3-8D94-419F-AFF1-B652E9DCDEF4                                  Unencrypted /code/pre  And  precode$ diskutil cs list CoreStorage logical volume groups (1 found) | +-- Logical Volume Group 08436957-C5CD-4DC6-B9FA-05B51A3EEFC8     =========================================================     Name:         Macintosh HD     Status:       Online     Size:         91387686912 B (91.4 GB)     Free Space:   35364864 B (35.4 MB)     |     +-&lt; Physical Volume FFC67A8D-65A8-415E-A594-D7A6BED71844     |   ----------------------------------------------------     |   Index:    0     |   Disk:     disk0s2     |   Status:   Online     |   Size:     91387686912 B (91.4 GB)     |     +-&gt; Logical Volume Family 56C0E988-502B-43D5-90DD-EFBE58143896         ----------------------------------------------------------         Encryption Status:       Unlocked         Encryption Type:         None         Conversion Status:       NoConversion         Conversion Direction:    -none-         Has Encrypted Extents:   No         Fully Secure:            No         Passphrase Required:     No         |         +-&gt; Logical Volume 4F26F5C3-8D94-419F-AFF1-B652E9DCDEF4             ---------------------------------------------------             Disk:                  disk1             Status:                Online             Size (Total):          90999996416 B (91.0 GB)             Conversion Progress:   -none-             Revertible:            No             LV Name:               Macintosh HD             Volume Name:           Macintosh HD             Content Hint:          Apple_HFS /code/pre  <answer153748> There are at least two approaches to solve your problem: One is potentially destructive, vastly undocumented and i don't know if it works (1) and the other one is  for sure destructive (2).   strongemSo please backup your Mac OS X and your Ubuntu partition if necessary./em/strong  Requirements: USB thumb drive with a full working Mac OS X and iPartition installed or a Linux Live USB with gparted.

The 'diskutil list' was already in the first screenshot :) <comment180771> it's much more convenient if you copy the output and paste it in a 'code box'. then i don't have to decipher & type the lengthy UUIDs. BTW did you install a Yosemite preview/DP previously? <comment180784> btw, iPartition can't handle Core Storage (Logical Volume Group) <comment180790> Thanks Tetsujin, that explains that.   @klanomath, I haven't installed a preview before. What I did do is resize the Logical Volume in an attempt to partition and was unable to size it back to max, hence the 91gb instead of 91.4 gb. <comment180850> @hhhhhhhhh How many free space do you have in your Macintosh HD partition? iPartition uses GiB instead of GB - (85,11 GiB=91,39 GB) <comment180897> If that is true, than I could actually use iPartition to rearrange the whole thing? The Logical Volume Group has 35.4 MB available, the Logical Partition 8.3 GB and the Core Storage Physical Volume doesn't give any info about free space. All named Macintosh HD. <comment180914> @hhhhhhhhh No not at all (85,11 GiB=91,39 GB=91386166640 Bytes). Please just start into your Mac User and  cmd-i the then hopefully visible 'Macintosh HD' Icon on your desktop and tell me the free space indicated there. <comment180939> Capacity: 91 GB. Available: 8.32 GB. Used: 82,678,120,448 bytes (82.68 GB on disk) <comment181146> I followed the steps up until step 5. Since the size of the core volume changed I booted the laptop with a Ubuntu Live USB and used gparted to resize the partition non-destructively. Unfortunately I did not have to follow your other steps so could not test them, but I'm sure that this walk-through will provide a great handle for others. I've seen more people around with the same problem! Thank you. <comment181147> so 'diskutil cs resizeStack' was successful? how much did you shrink the LV? <comment181186> Down to 82gb. From what I can see, both partitions are functioning properly. <comment207006> I completely reinstalled my laptop and can say that all steps presented here are correct, even the destructive ones.
