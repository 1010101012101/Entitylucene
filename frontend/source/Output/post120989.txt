Safari 7 user agent defaults on redirect <body> I have recently seen that when there is a redirect on the webpage that you are browsing and your user agent is set to strongiPhone3/strong on the page that did the redirect, Safari defaults to strongAutomatically Chosen/strong on the newly loaded page.  How does one fix this?  <comment141018> Did you try the preference? <comment141019> Are you talking about the Developer menu? Because that is where I changed it. <comment141025> That one only applies to the currently open page, not for redirect. <comment141033> I'm pretty sure it used to work like that on Safari 6.0
