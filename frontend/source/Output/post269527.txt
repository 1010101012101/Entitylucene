Is it possible to run Windows VM from bootable SSD? <body> I have made a bootable Windows 10 SSD, which I use to boot into Windows on my iMac. This works fine, Windows runs natively and SSD over USB 3 if fast.  But now, I want to have my cake and eat it to - I would like to be able to boot into OS X (Sierra) and start a Windows VM which would boot from the same SSD instead of virtual hard disk. Is this possible at all?  <answer269686> Found the answer on the internets:  Adding a raw disk to a VirtualBox machine on OSX
