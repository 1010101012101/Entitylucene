Cannot install iOS update <body> I have an update iOS 7.1.2 waiting which I cannot install since it tells me that I don't have enough free space. The update is 28.8 MB and I have 1.1 GB free. But the update apparently requires 1.5 GB free to install, which is absolutely ridiculous. I realize that the update itself will not use the 1.5 GB afterwards, but this just reeks of bad design. This means that on my 16 GB iPad (where I already have to economize the space) I have to waste 10% of the disk in order to be able to install updates.  So, is there a way around this issue other than deleting additional apps or data? I have already deleted more than I cared for.  <answer141689> Updating through iTunes rather than OTA has a smaller storage space requirement on the device. I believe it's much closer to 1 GB, but I don't have an actual number to provide.  To update through iTunes, connect your device over USB, select it and click Update.  <comment166957> I figured that this might be an option (although 1 GB is still a lot). However, since I have never actually used my iPad with iTunes it wants me to sync them and transfer apps from my iPad. I will only do this as an last resort as I honestly think that iTunes is one of the worst peaces of software that has been forced upon us. I simply LOVE OTA updating and iCloud backup, and going back to iTunes (even for a moment) seems like a big step backwards. Anyway, unless there comes a better answer I will still accept this.
