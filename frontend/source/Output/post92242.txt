iPhone 4S chip overheating after replacing screen <body> I just bought a used iPhone 4S with cracked screen, and installed a new lcd with gold frame. Just after putting the phone together it starts overheating. I have not installed any apps since recovery (fresh start). It seems as if the chip and the flash memory gets extremely hot. I almost burned myself touching it! The battery drains quickly from 20% to shutdown in a few minutes.   Does anyone know a solution to this?  <comment108236> Are location services on, and being used? <comment110466> Just replacing the screen wouldn't cause this... what was the cause of the broken screen in the first place?
