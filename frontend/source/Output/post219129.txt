How do I make my Mac use .bash_profile to add extra paths after I statically set $PATH? <body> I, like an idiot, decided to codeexport PATH=/usr/local/sbin//code.  After some googling I was informed that one should use a code.bash_profile/code file in the root directory of your user which you can use to append paths to the initial code$PATH/code . However the code.bash_profile/code file did not exist prior to me creating one so I'm unsure how to prompt my Mac to actually use this file as part of it's codePATH/code configuration. Every site I've visited simply tells you to make edits to said file but does not explain how to get the OS to use it.  How do I get my Mac to read from code.bash_profile/code to add custom paths?   <answer219130> Try:  precodecd ~ echo 'export PATH="$PATH:(insert other path here)"' &gt; .bash_profile /code/pre  or  precodecd ~ touch .bash_profile nano .bash_profile /code/pre  This file is read automatically.  <answer219131> The bash shell actually defaults to look for code~/.bash_profile/code even though it may not initially exist.  After creating this file in the root directory of your user, just enter codesource ~/.bash_profile/code . This forces the bash shell to read immediately from the file and will run it's contents straight away.  As long as you have a line that looks like codeexport PATH=&lt;directories&gt;/code in the file, your codePATH/code will be set by this every time. This helped.  <comment265037> This file is normally in your home folder and it's read automatically; try `cat ~/.bash_profile` to see if the file exists: it is invisible in finder. Or, alternatively, run `ls -lah` in your home folder to see if it exists.
