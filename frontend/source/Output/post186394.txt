How do I depend on a specific version of a homebrew formula <body> I'm having a conflict with a formula and a particular version of Boost. Ideally, since this is really just a build conflict (it's not using a Boost shared library), I'd like to automatically use a specific version when building. I doubt this is possible, so I'd really just be happy with it as a conflict or as dependency, but I can't find documentation for that. What I found is the generic dependency example:  precodeclass Foo &lt; Formula   depends_on "boost" =&gt; "with-icu" end /code/pre  Is this even something I can do?  <answer246831> Homebrew is still improving their support for depending on old versions of a library, with some planned improvements in this issue. In the meantime, you can use the homebrew/versions tap, which has formulae for boost 1.55 and boost 1.59. To depend on these versioned formulae, you could use the following:  precodedepends_on "homebrew/versions/boost155" /code/pre  or  precodedepends_on "homebrew/versions/boost159" /code/pre  EDIT:  You mentioned lack of documentation about conflicts. There is a conflicts_with keyword, but that is more about conflicts with being installed side-by-side. There's also a fails_with keyword, but that is related to specific versions of compilers. I think using codedepends_on/code with a formula from codehomebrew/versions/code will work best for you.  <comment304614> I noticed you mentioned lack of documentation about conflicts. There is a [conflicts_with](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/search?q=conflicts) keyword, but that is more about conflicts with being installed side-by-side. There's also a [fails_with](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/search?q=fails_with) keyword, but that is related to specific versions of compilers. I think the answer has the best approach for you.
