Why is my touch bar so buggy? <body> My touch bar often shows the wrong keys, is unresponsive, or (as is the current situation) only shows one or some of the keys. Right now I'm listening to Spotify and only the pause button is showing whereas it usually has my normal configuration. I have hard-set it to a custom configuration which is almost identical to the keys before the touch bar came out.  Note - I just started pressing all over the touch bar and the correct buttons came on in each area that I pressed.  This thing offers little value and causes lots of problems. I haven't played around with it much or done anything with my computer (i.e. fun/sketchy software) that is atypical. Are there common reasons for the new touch bar to break all the time?  <answer282625> I'd imagine the Touch Bar can become buggy for the same reasons that any computer becomes buggy, so what you could do is use Touch Bar Simulator to see what your Touch Bar thinks it's displaying, thereby narrowing it down to if the issue is software or hardware. If it's software, try the usual stuff like disk repair and reinstalling macOS. If it's hardware, it may be time to visit an Apple Store...  <answer282648> If it was me I'd reset both the NVRAM and SMC (in that order). Before following the steps below, ensure you have no external hardware connected and that you're using the strongbuilt-in keyboard/strong.  strongReset the NVRAM/strong  Reset the NVRAM on your MBP as follows:  ol listrongShut down your machine./strong Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out./li liPress the kbdpower button/kbd emand then/em immediately press the kbdcommand/kbdkbdoption/kbdkbdP/kbdkbdR/kbd keys. /li liKeep these keys pressed down for strongat least 20 seconds!/strong/li liLet go of the keys and let your Mac reboot normally./li /ol  strongNote 1:/strong When you log back in you strongemmay/em/strong need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. speaker volume, screen resolution, startup disk selection, time zone information, etc).  strongReset the SMC/strong  To reset the SMC on your MBP, I'd follow these steps:  ol liShut down your Mac/li liUnplug the power cable from your Mac/li liFor 10 seconds, press and hold at the same time the kbdshift/kbdkbdcontrol/kbdkbdoption/kbd keys (on the strongleft/strong side of the strongbuilt-in/strong keyboard) strongemand/em/strong the kbdpower button/kbd/li liAfter 10 seconds let go of all keys and the power button /li liPlug in the power cable/li liTurn your Mac back on with the power button./li /ol  After resetting both the NVRAM and SMC, use your computer to determine if the issue still persists. Let me know how you go.
