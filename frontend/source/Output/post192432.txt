Is there any limit to the number of users connected via Personal Hotspot? <body> How many users can be connected to an iPhone's personal hotspot? Does the limit differ from device to device? I want to know the limit of maximum users.  <answer192433> Quoting from an Apple support article about Personal Hotspot (emphasis mine):     When you connect a device to your Personal Hotspot, the status bar turns blue and shows how many devices have joined. strongThe number of devices that can join your Personal Hotspot at one time depends on your carrier and iPhone model./strong   I believe the typical limit is usually between 3 to 5 devices.  <answer227957> You can have up to 21 people join I have had that many people and I have 5s   <comment228861> ahan. so it depends on carrier.
