jittery fragmented desktop effects (ML) <body> Yesterday, suddenly, I encountered strange laggy/jittery behavior of dektop visual effects, when enabling full-screen to safari, changing desktops, showing the notifications bar etc... i show it here (notice fragmenting near dock and left size of safari when resizing) - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3PIWYLsv00 What is strange is that system itself is working fine, benchmarks like cinebench or geekbench are showing normal numbers. What could have happen? How to fix it?  Mike
