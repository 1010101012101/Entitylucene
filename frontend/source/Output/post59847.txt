How to selectively route traffic for one specified IP adddress through the VPN tunnel (not all traffic)? <body> Goal: To selectively route traffic over a VPN, so that general browsing/downloads goes via the normal primary connection, with my business VPN traffic going over the VPN.  I have tried a similar method mentioned here, but no matter how I changed the details it didn't work.  The VPN works, I can connect and route all traffic over it, so that is not the issue.  Home IP: 192.168.34.X  IP from VPN: 192.168.1.X  IP's (via VPN) trying to access in the internal network: 10.4.X.X, 196.220.X.X  How to selectively route traffic for one specified IP adddress through the VPN tunnel (not all traffic)?  <answer59858> Step 1, create two plain text files named ip-up and ip-down in /etc/ppp and make the two files executable:  precode$ sudo touch /etc/ppp/ip-{up,down} $ sudo chmod +x /etc/ppp/ip-{up,down} /code/pre  Step 2, modify the file strongip-up/strong, add the following:  precode#!/bin/sh export PATH="/bin:/sbin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin"  OLDGW=`netstat -nr | grep '^default' | grep -v 'ppp' | sed 's/default *\([0-9\.]*\) .*/\1/'`  if [ ! -e /tmp/pptp_oldgw ]; then     echo "${OLDGW}" &gt; /tmp/pptp_oldgw fi  dscacheutil -flushcache route add 10.4.0.0/24 "${OLDGW}" /code/pre  Step 3, modify the strongip-down/strong, add the following:  precode#!/bin/sh export PATH="/bin:/sbin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin"  if [ ! -e /tmp/pptp_oldgw ]; then         exit 0 fi  ODLGW=`cat /tmp/pptp_oldgw`  route delete 10.4.0.0/24 "${OLDGW}" rm /tmp/pptp_oldgw /code/pre  <comment68950> Tried this exactly as you outlined - it did not work. Still not able to access either of the webpages via the VPN only while other browsing is via default connection.  Any further thoughts? <comment68998> The script is selectively not route traffic for specific IP.  Other than those IP, all route via VPN.  ip-up runs when you connect to VPN, the specific IP will add to your old route table (so not going through VPN).  ip-down runs when you disconnect from VPN. <comment112781> Shame I cannot comment for some reason --- this is not an answer but a follow-up. So before deleting it, please see my question here: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/96071/how-to-route-only-parallels-over-vpn I would like to route my VM traffic (or just some specific public IPs) over my PPTP VPN, but (maybe because my settings are not manual) I cannot figure out the specifics. Thanks!
