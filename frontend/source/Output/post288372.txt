Installing Crystalbuntu on Apple TV First Generation <body> I'm trying to install XMBC on my old Apple TV 1 (first generation) It says I can easily install it via a USB drive, but every file I have tried does not work. I saw some articles here referencing stmlabs.com but the file to download no longer exists.  Here are the specs of the software version:  precodeSoftware  Version : 1.0 Software Build : 175 OS Build Version : 8N5107 EIF Version : 00DA.B04 IR Version : 3.1.2 GF Version: 3.1.0/2.9.50 /code/pre  Can anyone provide a direct link to the image file I need to put on the USB? Or is there an updated installation guide?
