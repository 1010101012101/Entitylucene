Yosemite Mail.app - Rule stuck on 7 days <body> I want to make a rule to delete all emails older than 200 days (they will remain on Gmail - I am using POP).  'Date Received' 'is less than' [7] days.  I can set this up for 7 days in rules fine - but if I enter any other value, save it then go back. It always says 7 days.  I guess this is a Yosemite / Mail.app bug?!  I found nothing on Google about this issue.  <answer163340> Copied from TunaMaxx above who doesn't have enough rep to answer:  I've found out more about this, but I don't have enough rep in this community to get over the protection on this ticket. However I have since found out this is a bug in Apple Mail, and has existed for a number of versions. The good news is the values you enter are actually recorded and respected, even though the UI says "7 days" all the time. To verify, set a rule to a number like '57' or something. Then, open ~/Library/Mail/V2/MailData/SyncedRules.plist and search for '57' in that file. You'll find it close to the matching rule info. The value survives and is respected even restarting Mail. â€“  <comment188422> I don't have an answer, but wanted you to know you're not alone. I have the exact same 'stuck on 7 days' issue with Mail in Yosemite too. <comment191140> I've found out more about this, but I don't have enough rep in this community to get over the protection on this ticket.

Many radars have been filed from what I hear.
