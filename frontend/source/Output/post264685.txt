administrator account with parental control? <body> what is the use of having a parental control on and administrator account?  I have a mac where a 12 years old girl is using, she can do what ever she like (install apps, chat, etc) but want to have restriction on web sites against porn, etc  currently she has admin account, and I see that i can activate the parental control on! I did and it worked, but she can change the settings? my test shows she can not, what do you think?  <comment331774> So give here a normal user account without admin rights...
