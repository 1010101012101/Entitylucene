How do I queue up tracks one after the other on Apple Music? <body> I want to browse through my library and queue up tracks after each other but you can only queue up next, not after the last one you added if that makes sense.   So use case:  ol liPress play on track /li liAdd another track B to play next /li liAdd another track C to play after track B /li liEtc etc /li /ol  With Apple Music it just plays track c before b.
