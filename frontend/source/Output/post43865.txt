What's the battery life of the new iPad 4G with LTE disabled/enabled? <body> I saw a video about the new iPad and it showed that you could disable LTE.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7Tn7x.png" alt="enter image description here"  Apple had to increase the battery capacity in the new iPac because upgrades like LTE and the new display draw significantly more power.  h2Question/h2  ul liWhat's the battery life of the new iPad 4G with LTE disabled/enabled?/li liApple's product specs are unspecific: "Up to 9 hours of surfing the web using cellular data network."/li /ul  <answer43866> I'm not sure. But what I do know it the fact the battery in the new iPad has 70% more capacity and people describe it as massive.  It has a massive 11,666mAh (the iPad 2 has just 6994mAH). The same battery in an iPad 2 would give...      To put that in context, an iPad 2 with with this new battery, if such   a device existed, would probably last close to 17 hours on Wi-Fi.   So I'm as curious as you are about the finding of the new battery! I'm waiting for the first reviews (it shouldn't be that long anymore since the first iPad are already sold...)  <answer44029> The battery is great, really lasts all day long but Also takes about 6 hours to fully charge. Well we can't have everything our way. Love it tho.  <answer44081> well, according to the official Apple Website, if you scroll about halfway down the page that I gave the link to, on the right side, you should find a small paragraph, saying that the battery life of the new IPad is actually 10 hours.  <answer44143> I'm not sure about the length of the battery, but I have some anecdotal evidence that may be useful.   The iPad was fully charged at 6 AM, but I didn't use it until 11. By 3 PM, after watching  two episodes of emGame of Thrones/em (55 and 45 minutes long) among other things, that battery was showing 20% charge. I have push email off and no notifications, and I was on WiFi.  <comment49862> I find it suspicious they are so vague about the type of cellular data network. My guess is enabling LTE would actually bring the 9h down instead of the opposite. I think the larger battery should be attributed mostly to the retina display. <comment49866> @Gerry I tend to agree with you. It would be a bummer if LTE on the iPad would not last a day. <comment50086> Thanks for that answer! I'm aware of this. However, the problem remains that Apple's information is unclear on what is the power consumption with LTE enabled. <comment50206> Is your iPad an 3G/LTE iPad or the WiFi-only model?
