How to display Google App Contacts in a separate iChat list? <body> I have a few accounts in iChat:  ul liGMail/li liAIM/li liGoogle Apps (a custom domain)/li /ul  Both GMail and Google Apps put all my contacts in the 'Buddies' list. Can I rename my Gmail list to "GMail Contacts' or something else so that both accounts dont get merged?  <answer4825> Yes, and Yes.  Just add a new group, and then drag your Google App contacts to the newly named group.  It's really that easy. You can right click on any group name, and select emrename/em.  You can also do the same with Adium  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/13goU.png" alt="alt text"  <answer5560> I actually just tried this and iChat does it automatically. As you can see I have a different window for each account, and I think you can actually set the window's title by setting the account description under codeSettings/code-codeAccounts/code. As you can see I even have different groups for each account.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Kaskl.png" alt="screenshot"  Although I usually have them unified using Chax's feature codeUse All Contacts window as primary contact list/code  <comment4754> I would be nice if you could format this question a little cleaner, especially that "GMail AIM Google Apps" line. Click the yellow backgrounded '?' icon for details. <comment4755> Groups != List Segmentation. Putting all your buddies on one account into a group = organization hell, and will really start to suck down the road. Especially if (god forbid) you move onto a client other than iChat. <comment4763> is this on OS X or iOS?
