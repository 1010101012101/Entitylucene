Core Apps Not Launching After Installing OS X Mavericks <body> I Installed OS X Mavericks about a week ago, It worked fine at first but all of a sudden no core Apps will load.  Mail, iCal, App Store, Maps, iMessage all quit and log a console message "Exited with Code 1"   I have tried: rebooting, resetting the NVRAM, and booting my OS in safe mode. None fix the problem.  I really don't know how to fix this without doing a clean install and wonder if anyone has a solution to this more narrow than reinstalling the OS cleanly?   <answer107328> Take a look hear to see if this solution helps you.  https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3826648  <answer108310> I managed to fix the issue by reinstalling OS X Mavericks  Here's how to fix it  ol liRestart your machine/li liOn boot hold Command and R/li liChoose to Reinstall OS X/li /ol  System will restart as usual after install and OS X will be fully functional  You will NOT lose any settings or personal data with this method  :)  <comment125866> can I assume you have rebooted? the console could probably provide some useful feedback here. <comment125867> I have rebooted, Reset the PRAM, Booted in safe mode... Can't think of anything else?  I can't install an update as the App store refuses to launch  :( <comment125868> According to the Console the Apps have "Exited with Code 1" <comment125880> Can you provide more information than just a link that may become invalid?
