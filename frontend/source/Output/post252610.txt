`safari` and `kernel_task` is reading/writing at more than 50+MB/s at the same time <body> One in a while (frequency lesser than once a month), my iMac will slow down and not able to do anything, it could last a few minutes, and then if I would just wait, it will eventually go back to normal state.  The only information I could gather, is that my I/O is consumed between codesafari/code and codekernel_task/code. codesafari/code is being read at about 30MB/s ~ 100MB/s, and codekernel_task/code is writing at the same speed.  The only thing I could do, is:  ul liwait a few minutes, the number could close to ten./li liquickly CMD+Q on codesafari/code, and as soon as it's closed, the computer will return normal within half a minute./li /ul  This problem has bugged me for some time. I research a lot and open many tabs, but I do not know what actually caused this problem, because my 8GB of RAM is always underutilise, like 50% free most of the time.  Anyone can problem me some insight where I could trace to the root of problem?  Thank you.
