How to auto-accept cookies notifications as mandated by EU law? <body> EU law forces websites to notify visitors about the use of cookies. Clicking on these messages is quite a nuisance. I've found a plugin on  https://cookiesok.com but this is only available for Chrome, Firefox and Opera.  Does anybody know of something similar for Safari? Or other means to accomplish the same?  <answer221873> h1Use an AdBlock Filter/h1  Filter the cookie requests using your preferred advert blocker for Safari and the block-the-eu-cookie-s***-list:     Adblock / Adblock plus filter list for blocking cookie notifications      Add https://raw.github.com/r4vi/block-the-eu-cookie-shit-list/master/filterlist.txt to your filter subscriptions if you want to block "EU cookie law" notifications and popups.   Please note the swear word in the link is required. Regrettable, as the name will limit widespread adoption.  <answer239552> Stand alone extension (without ad blocking features):  https://smartersoft.github.io/CookiebarGone/  <comment268896> Unfortunately, a simple blocking filter doesn't work for cookie alerts that require clicking 'yes' before cookies are set :( <comment269484> For sites that demand acceptance, an exception to the advert blocker can be added. This is often called whitelisting a site. This can be done on a site by site basis. <comment269486> Yes, but this isn't auto-acceptance like the extension in the question.
