Is there any shortcut/easy way to switch this system proxy settings? <body> Sometimes I need to send my traffic to a proxy, sometimes I don't.  Currently, I have to go to the settings every time to click it.  Is there any simple way for me to switch this? For instance, use a shell command to do this.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ARXZ4.png" alt="system proxy"  <answer287690> Use "Locations" under Network Preferences.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pWxeI.png" alt="enter image description here"  Set up a location that has the proxy and then a location that doesn't.  When you want to use the proxy, pick that location and your settings will change.    <answer287691> Take a look at this page at YourMacGuy about the Terminal command codenetworksetup/code. Although the page dates from 2008, the command exists and works in macOS Sierra. Perhaps one of the proxy-related commands will work for you. You can always create multiple Locations in System Preferences  Network that can enable or disable the proxy. You will still need to open System Preferences, though.  <answer287692> This can be done with codenetworksetup/code.  Get all services:  precodenetworksetup -listallnetworkservices /code/pre  Then with the proper service (e.g Ethernet or the name of your USB 10/100/1000 LAN adapter) enter  precodesudo networksetup -setsocksfirewallproxy &lt;networkservice&gt; &lt;domain&gt; &lt;port number&gt; &lt;authenticated&gt; &lt;username&gt; &lt;password&gt; /code/pre  or  precodesudo networksetup -setwebproxy &lt;networkservice&gt; &lt;domain&gt; &lt;port number&gt; &lt;authenticated&gt; &lt;username&gt; &lt;password&gt; /code/pre  to configure it (which isn't necessary in your case, because you already entered all necessary values).  e.g.  precodesudo networksetup -setsocksfirewallproxy Ethernet 127.0.0.1 18080 sudo networksetup -setwebproxy Ethernet 127.0.0.1 18080 /code/pre  strongTo simply toggle it on or off use:/strong   precodesudo networksetup -setsocksfirewallproxystate networkservice on | off sudo networksetup -setwebproxystate networkservice on | off /code/pre  e.g.   precodesudo networksetup -setsocksfirewallproxystate Ethernet off sudo networksetup -setwebproxystate Ethernet off /code/pre  codeman networksetup/code will reveal other proxy options (gopher, ftp, etc.)  <comment363288> `sudo networksetup -setsocksfirewallproxy "USB 10/100/1000 LAN" 127.0.0.1 8888` /  `sudo networksetup -setsocksfirewallproxystate "USB 10/100/1000 LAN" off` / `sudo networksetup -setsocksfirewallproxystate "USB 10/100/1000 LAN" on` works great.
