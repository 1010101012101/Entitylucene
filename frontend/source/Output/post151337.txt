Can the name under the Bank Account be different from Account holder? <body> My sister made an iTunes Connect account and signed up for the developer program (she is over 21). I am the developer of the account; i'm just not exactly 18 yet (will be in a couple months).  In setting up the agreements/tax/banking, can she input my bank account information, since it has a different name than that on the developer account? If not, is there anything she can do (add me as a developer or something) to be able to?  <answer151649> Per the iTunes Connect Developer Guide (emphasis mine):     Specify the bank account.      Identify the bank account by the following:      ...      Account Holder Name. Be sure that the Account Holder Name exactly matches the name strongexpected by the bank/strong; it strongdoesn't have to match the Legal Entity Name/strong for the iTunes Connect organization.   <comment180087> Can the bank account holder be younger than 18 years of age? <comment180094> You would need to ask Apple. It is not mentioned in the Developer Guide.
