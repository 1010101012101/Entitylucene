Can't see Internet Radio in iTunes Libary despite it being checked in preferences <body> How do I make it visible?  iTunes 11.1.5 OSX 10.9.2  <answer128273> If you have enabled it, you should see it as shown on the screenshot.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nojhp.png" alt="screenshot"  <answer128275> Have you tried turning off internet radio and turning it back on via preferences?  Have you also tried quitting codeiTunes.app/code and restarting it (with/without the preference selected)? I just tried, and it worked in all of these cases on my Mac (rMBP, OS X 10.9.2, iTunes 11.1.5(5) (64-bit).   <comment150235> Actually I now realise I meant in the sidebar. The preferences dialog states 'Library' and the sidebar states 'Library' so you'd think that the two would be identical dependent on selection <comment150236> Yes and yes. See my other comment about the sidebar. <comment150238> I believe that you’re just stuck with Music — “Internet”. I don’t think that there’s a way (currently) to get the “Internet Radio” feature to show up in the sidebar.
