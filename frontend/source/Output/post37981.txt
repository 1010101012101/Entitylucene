Show text using Large Type without relying on third-party applications <body> Apple has this amazing feature called 'Large Type', chiefly implemented into Address Book. When you look up a contact, you can right-click the phone number and click 'Large Type', and it will display it very largely across your screen.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0I2o1.png" alt="Apple&#39;s Phone Number displayed via Large Type"  This function is relatively popular for many uses. Users who watched Leo Laporte on TWiT.tv on weekends will see Large Type being used to display wrap reminders to him during his radio show when his iMac is on camera.  As far as I'm aware, the only ways to invoke this are (1) the Address Book function as demonstrated above, or (2) directly via Quicksilver's Large Type plugin, or (3) Applescript invoking a function of Quicksilver or some other application that supports Large Type.  Since I've stopped using Quicksilver, and don't use LaunchBar, I'm left high and dry for putting arbitrary text into a Large Type banner.  Since it's obviously a core feature of OS X, how do we invoke it with arbitrary text under Lion?  <answer38308> I understand you don't want to depend on a third-party app, but I haven't been able to find any other way to do it. Here is an AppleScript solution which requires LaunchBar to be emrunning/em, but you can set the keyboard shortcut to activate LaunchBar to something you'd never accidentally do, and you can hide LaunchBar's icon from the dock.  precode tell application "LaunchBar"       display in large type input  end tell /code/pre  Either use this as a script, or create a Service workflow in Automator which receives text as input from any application.  <answer38315> Ok, this is not the real thing but kind of working for me:  In Automator create a "Service":  ul liService receives selected codetext/code in codeany application/code/li liCreate Banner Image from Text  ul liSave As: codelargetype/code/li liWhere: code/private/var/tmp//code [&radic;] Replacing existing file /li liText Style: any you like/li /ul/li liOpen Images in Preview/li /ul  Save your new Service and assign a keyboard shortcut if you like.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DEcSk.png" alt="DIY largetype"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pyvOR.png" alt="kbd shortcut"  Example:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/V0Rv3.png" alt="example"  <answer38350> A slight variation  on @iolsmit answer.  Do the same first action. But when you select 'strongwhere/strong' to save in the Banner action. Choose other. The Choose folder dialogue will pop up.  Now press down the keys: strongcommand/strong + strongShift/strong +strongG/strong  This will slide down will show up.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YQd96.png" alt="enter image description here"  In its text field; Type or copy &amp; paste:   precode ~/Library/Caches/TemporaryItems /code/pre  Then click emGO/em. This will take you to the Users temporary folder.  Choose it as your selected folder. It will show as 'strongTemporaryItems/strong'  Now add the action: 'strongRun Shell Script/strong' in place of 'emOpen Images in Preview/em'  The the 'strongRun Shell Script/strong'; Use its drop down menu for emPass input/em: strongemas Argument/em/strong  clear out in text that is already in the large text field. (i.e emcat/em)  And type or paste this in.  precode/usr/bin/qlmanage -p "$@" /code/pre  Save you new service.  And test  What happens is a new file is saved in your temp folder and the quick looked to display it on the screen.  Hit space to dismiss it as normal.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7z2VZ.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer220468> If relying on a browser is okay you could do it with large-type.com:  precode$ open http://large-type.com/#YourText /code/pre  <answer231335> There's a nice utility called 'LargeType2' that add a 'Service' menu item to display such large texts:  Homepage and download link: http://blyt.net/algrtepy2e/  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FOR2i.jpg" alt="official screenshot"  <comment43042> Related to, but not a duplicate of http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/25210/show-text-in-large-type-on-the-screen-via-terminal <comment43043> When I wanted to figure out how to do this, I searched for something like 'apple large type' and got directed to the above question. After reading it and being disappointed that it doesn't have an answer for *me*, I chuckled when I saw my own comment on the question. So now here's my variation that I'd love to figure out how to do. <comment43265> Would you find it acceptable to have LaunchBar installed, but not ever to use it? Or are you only looking for the core service that enables it? <comment43282> I could install Quicksilver or LaunchBar and leverage them, but had I done that I wouldn't have asked this question :). Ideally I don't have to depend on any particular application having been installed. <comment43388> I hope you have better luck than I did in finding a solution that doesn't involve LaunchBar! :) <comment43442> I like your version (using quicklook) better. But don't you think one should (re-)use a single file rather than creating a new file for each large-type call ? And I noticed that this versions does not work for text with illegal file names: e.g. try to select `/usr/bin/` and call large-type - «The action “Create Banner Image from Text” encountered an error.» Thus, I would suggest (re-)using a single filename. <comment43449> Good point, I did not run into that or actually think about it :-).  Will update.
