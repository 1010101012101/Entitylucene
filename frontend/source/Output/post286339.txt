Mac OS: 7.5.3 Command-Turn On <body> I'm not a mac user anymore. But I used to be one when I was a kid. My father had a Macintosh Performa 6200 running MacOS 7.5.3.  On said MacOS you could press command + the turn on key on the keyboard, and a white rectangle with a textcursor would appear.  Does anyone know what type of commands (and in what language) this box expected?  I googled around and found no mention of this textbox. Until this day I have not the slightest idea what that thing was.  <answer286369> That was the Debugger window that was built into the Mac's ROM. I never learned what language worked in it.   <answer286527> Yes, that was MacsBug! (IIRC it was a System Extension that had to be installed/enabled -- although it's been quite a number of years...)  I found a command reference for it here: MacsBug Reference.  There's some more info over on Wikipedia.  <comment361269> That does ring a bell but vaguely... I **believe** that dropped you into the NVRAM firmware allowing you to set boot arguments and other things stored in nvram/pram <comment361356> Interesting. Thanks! <comment361558> Small correction: It was not an (optional) extension. I can safely say that my dad would never install any debug extensions.
