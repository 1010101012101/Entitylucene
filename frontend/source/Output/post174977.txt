How to create custom Keyboard Shortcuts? <body> Is there any way to create custom keyboard shortcuts that do whatever you want through a third-party app or just through default OS X apps, like Automator and or AppleScript?  I want to create a shortcut that will bring up the power dialogue box, as shown in the image below.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lDeEZ.png" alt="Power Dialogue Box"  <answer174979> Assuming you're on a normal Mac then the power button will bring it up. Details here.  Further details about creating shortcuts here.  You can use the info in that document to create a short-cut in any app for whatever key combo you want for the Shutdown... item.  Simplified procedure:  ol liOpen System Preferences - Keyboard - Shortcuts tab/li liFrom the left, click App Shortcuts./li liClick +/li liChoose 'All Applications' as the app/li liChoose 'Shut Down...' as the command/li liPut in whatever shortcut you want./li /ol  <answer175085> On my 2013 MacBook Pro with Yosemite kbdcontrol/kbd + kbdeject/kbd does fine for bringing that dialog up.  As an aside, the behavior of the power button has become a bit fiddly (annoying...) for me.  <comment206182> Just a comment on the "Simplified procedure:", this does not bring up the same shutdown dialog box as shown in the OP, under OS X 10.8.x anyway.  Also Finder has to have the focus as well otherwise it doesn't trigger. <comment206253> Don't use Finder, use Any. <comment206302> @Tetsujin - yes, good call. Updated. <comment206333> Sorry, meant all apps [was on my phone] I re-edited <comment206334> in fact @user3439894 is correct, it's a different dialog, no options. Steve's answer is actually closer to what the OP wanted, in fact. I missed that earlier, sorry all. <comment206377> Well, I covered that case in the initial sentence - however, many users have custom keyboards, especially desktop users. <comment209766> Even though I didn't get to make a custom shortcut you still helped a bit. <comment271728> [control] + [power] works similarly on new Macs where the power button is in the place of the old eject button.  You'll have to hold it down a bit as it has a time delay (like [caps lock]) so you don't press it accidentally.
