Don't Sleep Network Connection / VPN <body> If I let my computer sleep my VPN connection seems to die. Mac shows it as still being up, but nothing over the VPN works until I reconnect and disconnect.  I am happy to have a my monitors sleep, but I want my network and VPN connection to stay active.  I'm running Yosemite with a wired connection. Anyone know how I might get this to happen? I'm open to using Caffeine or something like that, but with 3x 30 inch monitors my power bill will suck if I don't let them sleep (and turning them off is annoying because all my windows get rearranged).  <answer159108> Just put your displays to sleep in the energy saver settings (like in the picture below) and it should work.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/di3pv.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Please check the answer at serverfault for the reason why the VPN-connections breaks.  <answer159110> You might try codecaffeinate/code. It's the terminal utility that the Caffeine app runs. Running it from the terminal allows you to have more options:  codecaffeinate -ims/code can prevent system + disk + idle sleeping while still allowing your screen to sleep  codeman caffeinate/code:   precodeAvailable options:   -d      Create an assertion to prevent the display from sleeping.   -i      Create an assertion to prevent the system from idle sleeping.   -m      Create an assertion to prevent the disk from idle sleeping.   -s      Create an assertion to prevent the system from sleeping. This assertion is valid only when          system is running on AC power.   -u      Create an assertion to declare that user is active. If the display is off, this option turns          the display on and prevents the display from going into idle sleep. If a timeout is not spec-          ified with '-t' option, then this assertion is taken with a default of 5 second timeout.   -t      Specifies the timeout value in seconds for which this assertion has to be valid. The asser-          tion is dropped after the specified timeout. Timeout value is not used when an utility is          invoked with this command.   -w      Waits for the process with the specified pid to exit. Once the the process exits, the asser-          tion is also released.  This option is ignored when used with utility option. /code/pre  <answer200075> There's another thread - and proposed solution that might apply: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5537854?start=0&amp;tstart=0  <comment241085> While this link may answer the question, it is better to include the essential parts of the answer here and provide the link for reference.
