mail.app rejecting correct password for gmail accounts <body> Mail.app has stopped accessing several of my gmail accounts.  It gives the generic error "Mail can't connect to the account "xxxx".  Enter the password for user "myusernamehere".  When I enter the correct password, it circles back to this error. Going directly to gmail, I can login with that same password.    One of the two accounts with this problem is a new one I was setting up, but the other is my "main" account which has been in use with mail.app for years.  <answer149016> The fix is to login to the google account affected, and then go to https://www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureapps and select "Enable" for the question "Access for less secure apps."    Apparently this results from a change Google made several months ago to improve security, which is indeed becoming more and more important as Google accounts are tied to a wider and wider range of uses.  It is a mystery to me why it suddenly prevented my logging in now, but I wanted to share the solution I found in case anyone else encounters the same problem.
