iPad's update to iOS 8 already taken almost 2 days <body> MY iPad 2 was updating to iOS 8 since 2 days ago and up till now, it's still not finished. I'm not sure if this is normal or not, but the progress bar is at the same spot for a whole day already. Can somebody help me?  <answer155154> No, that's not normal. Restart the installation.  <answer155160> You can put the device into Recovery Mode &amp; restore from iTunes.   To force Reset, press and hold both the Sleep/Wake and Home buttons for at least 10 seconds, until you see the Apple logo.  If you have previously made a backup, you can then restore from that backup, either via iTunes or directly from iCloud  <comment182500> May I ask how I do that? Does it make me lose some data? <comment182501> This Answer doesn't really help in any way. It would be better to include details as to how to achieve that. <comment182502> I couldn't reset it no matter how long I hold the sleep/wake button. There's no response from the iPad no matter what I hold. <comment182503> I added a line on force reset <comment182504> You need to hold BOTH buttons for 10 seconds in order to force a reset <comment182505> It's working now, thank you.
