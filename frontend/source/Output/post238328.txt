How should I install JDK 8 on El Capitan? <body> I just installed JDK 8 to my machine but maven still thinks it is using JDK 6.  precode% mvn --version Exception in thread "main" java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: org/apache/maven/cli/MavenCli : Unsupported major.minor version 51.0 /code/pre  The correct java version is printing on the command line:  precode% java -version java version "1.8.0_91" Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_91-b14) Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.91-b14, mixed mode) /code/pre  Java Home looks okay:  precode% echo $JAVA_HOME /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_91.jdk/Contents/Home /code/pre  This looks suspicious:   precode% pwd /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions % ls -lt total 64 drwxr-xr-x  10 root  wheel  340 May 10 21:20 A lrwxr-xr-x   1 root  wheel    1 May 10 21:15 Current -&gt; A lrwxr-xr-x   1 root  wheel   10 May 10 21:15 1.4 -&gt; CurrentJDK lrwxr-xr-x   1 root  wheel   10 May 10 21:15 1.4.2 -&gt; CurrentJDK lrwxr-xr-x   1 root  wheel   10 May 10 21:15 1.6 -&gt; CurrentJDK lrwxr-xr-x   1 root  wheel   10 May 10 21:15 1.6.0 -&gt; CurrentJDK lrwxr-xr-x   1 root  wheel   52 May 10 21:15 CurrentJDK -&gt; /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk/Contents /code/pre  This folder has both JDK's:  precode% ls /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/ 1.6.0.jdk   jdk1.8.0_91.jdk /code/pre  Is the fix as simple as changing the symlink to the current JDK? There are many steps listed here, but are they really required?  <comment292241> You could try uninstalling your current Maven and reinstalling through Homebrew. I just did and Maven was able to pick up the correct/ latest Java version. Doing `mvn -version` shows Java 1.8 for me. <comment292268> @Ambidextrous Thanks! that worked.
