How to configure my apple remote with custom actions, including sleep & wake up? <body> This is basically a follow up of MSDOS's question. I've also came around same things he did and I am currently using iRedLite with great success. It is in almost all aspects even better than the already awesome RemoteBuddy - except it doesn't grab the process as good as.  Any way, I've figured an simple way to put the emdisplay/em to sleep with apple script and easily assigned it to holding the play button. And it works...  emExcept/em that it also crashes iRedLite. I think it enters in a dead loop or something and it just stop responding. But I believe even if it didn't crash, it still wouldn't work to wake up the display. That is because even if I enter sleep using CTRL+SHIFT+EJECT, I can't use the remote to wake up (when iRedLite didn't crash).  Meanwhile if I simply turn off iRedLite, I can put it to sleep and / or awake using any combinations with the keyboard shortcut or remote buttons. Holding the Play button is the default behaviour to put display to sleep.
