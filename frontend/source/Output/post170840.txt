Change font style for pdf's using Preview <body> As shown in the screenshot there are no options for changing the font under tools. I went through all main menu options and no features for manipulating the color, size, etc are there.  This should be a dead simple operation - any tips here?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9dgQZ.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongUPDATE/strong  I had found references to preview having the ability to modify the text/font characteristics - specifically in the place my screenshot shows. They are not there however: is this a Yosemite specific limitation? https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4674837?start=0&amp;tstart=0  strongAnother update/strong  One of the answers provided download links for pdfs. I have selected text field and right clicked. The screenshot follows: There are not any options for changing the font/font size: only the color. What is different for me?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CX4NW.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer170852> Writable or fillable PDF files allow you to include text directly on the PDF file and save the document as if you were filling it out with a pen or pencil. Your Mac includes the Preview application built into the operating system that comes with all the tools you'll need to work with PDF documents. Use the extended toolbar to change the Font of your text when filling out a writeable PDF In another word, you can change the font size when you fill in PDF-based forms .

On the Windows side of things if you are using Adobe Reader there is no UI or interface for changing the font.  If you are using Adobe Acrobat Pro/Standard you can change the font.  One workaround I have found is copy some text with the font you want to use from another application and paste it into the PDF form fill field.  Please note this will only work if the PDF form has rich text formatting enabled.  Good luck!  <answer197150> On Yosemite (Preview 8.0), hit shift-command-A or select "Show Markup Toolbar" from the "View" menu:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/emgh4.png" width="382"  Find font options by clicking on the italic A:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IwDog.png" width="501"  <answer278850> I realize that you've likely moved on by now, but for anyone else searching for this feature:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lIbda.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dHGED.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment200952> Those instructions do not reflect the options actually presented to me: specifically the following Font selection window does not show anywhere: "Click the 'A' button on the toolbar to open the 'Font' selection window." <comment200953> I changed my answer, you can download the sample form and try <comment200960> OK I did.   Please see updated OP: there are not any options for changing the font/font size: only the color. What is different for me? <comment200987> What Nelson is sayingg is that those options only apply to text you add in text entry fields of a pdf form, not text that already existed the first time you opened the pdf in Preview. <comment200988> Yes i understand. I do not see those options for *new* text entry fields. <comment234544> seems as good an answer/approach as any.  The "copy to another app and then copy it back" has applied in other situations such as doing strikethrough in gmail (no native support) <comment235657> The question is about Preview on Mac OS X, not Adobe Reader. <comment235658> Please put quote marks around the first part of your answer, since you copied and pasted it from someplace else and did not write it yourself.  Also, the linked article now redirects to a non-Mac-specific article on Adobe reader.

I unfortunately cannot test since I don't have a Mac with Preview in front of me. <comment320632> No it did not work. Why is this the selected answer? <comment350989> thx - i am awarding. But it *is* irksome not to include these options in the menu.
