How to Run Homebrew's Caskroom/cask/pdfinfo? <body> I run codebrew install Caskroom/cask/pdfinfo/code but I cannot find in my commandline. My PATH is   precode/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/Library/TeX/texbin /code/pre  hr  How can you run codepdfinfo/code of Homebrew?  <answer239169> Homebrew cask installs codepdfinfo/code in  precode/opt/homebrew-cask/Caskroom/pdfinfo/latest/PDFInfo.app /code/pre  And then creates a symbolic link to this locations in:  precode~/Applications /code/pre  You can run installed codepdfinfo/code with:  precodeopen -a pdfinfo /code/pre  or  precodeopen -a /opt/homebrew-cask/Caskroom/pdfinfo/latest/PDFInfo.app /code/pre  or  precodeopen -a ~/Applications/PDFInfo.app /code/pre  Simply you can open app with double click on code~/Applications/PDFInfo.app/code icon.  <comment293462> Why it works like that? Why you cannot run it just with `pdfinfo` like in Linux? I need to bind it to my Unix scripts, and would not like to give OSX special attention. <comment293463> @Masi because cask treats in AppStore way with applications. It creates `.app` applications that can be moved into `/Applications`. The `~/Applications` path is user-specific applications instead of system applications (`/Applications`). You can run it with this address `~/Applications/PDFInfo.app/Contents/MacOS/PDFInfo` directly from terminal. Or add `~/Applications/PDFInfo.app/Contents/MacOS/` to your $PATH or simply create an alias for `PDFInfo` command in your script to this path. <comment293466> Why is there no `pdfinfo` terminal tool in Homebrew? <comment293472> @Masi It can be done with Automator workflows that is described here : http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/113092/117407 and Automator workflows can be invoked from terminal: http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20060805092715125 You can combine these if you want. Unfortunately I am not familiar with better command line utility for this purpose.
