How to disable scroll acceleration in macOS Sierra? <body> A few releases ago OS X introduced scroll acceleration, which means if you keep scrolling in some direction, the speed of the scroll will be greater and greater. You cannot disable this from the UI. It is extremely annoying if you want to scroll through a long website or a long source code in an editor.  Until macOS Sierra you could disable this using DisableExtremeScrollAcceleration tool. But this tool is no longer working.  Is there any way to prevent the scroll acceleration?  <answer253658> Try USB Overdrive. I was having the same problem as you and this fixed it. It works with MacOS Sierra.  Credit to this post  <answer253966> I found the "fix" for my Logitech mouse.  ol liSystem Preferences/li liControl Center (available when you install Logitech control center)/li liSelect your mouse and click "configure"./li liSelect mouse wheel./li liOn the bottom, there is a "acceleration" label with a slider. Set it to "null" or "max" (I can't see the difference.)/li /ol  I also had an issue with my back/forward buttons. Within the same control panel, I had to reconfigure them as "key strokes" of "cmd + left arrow" and "cmd + right arrow".  Edit: Logitech released an updated version of their control center, which fixes the issue.   <answer256051> Alternatively you can use SteerMouse. I've been using this for a few years.  It costs $20, but for me it was worth it.  Default mouse acceleration settings always annoy me.  Anyway, after install:  ol liOpen it up via System Preferences - SteerMouse./li liSelect the 'Scroll' tab./li liClick 'Roll Up, and in the next dialog choose Mode = Linear./li liDo the same for 'Roll Down'./li /ol  Pics below:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Npj8L.png" alt="Scroll Tab"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/R6mqG.png" alt="Roll Up Dialog"  <answer256192> System PreferencesAccessibilityMouse &amp; TrackpadTrackpad OptionsScrollingWithout Inertia  <answer256512> Here's what I've found, so far it seems kinda working:  http://dolphm.com/disable-mouse-pointer-acceleration-and-scroll-wheel-acceleration-in-os-x/  Type into the Terminal:  precodedefaults write .GlobalPreferences com.apple.scrollwheel.scaling -1 /code/pre  Then relogin.  <answer257079> I don't have the rep to upvote or comment on Sky D's post, but it was spot on:  For trackpad: System PreferencesAccessibilityMouse &amp; TrackpadTrackpad OptionsScrollingWithout Inertia  For mouse: System PreferencesAccessibilityMouse &amp; TrackpadMouse OptionsScrollingWithout Inertia  img src="https://i.imgur.com/lEGqXGF.png" alt="Inertia in images"  <answer262329> I wrote a small program to fix this behavior: https://github.com/emreyolcu/discrete-scroll  You may download a binary here. It runs in the background and allows you to scroll 3 lines with each tick of the wheel.  <answer264156> macOS Sierra introduced a scroll wheel deadzone where input would be ignored unless you scrolled at a minimum speed. Scrolling the wheel one notch at a time would not produce any movement on the screen. This deadzone made people scroll the wheel faster than before, thus hitting the acceleration threshold even faster (though it's always been there). The scroll wheel deadzone has been removed in the 10.2.2 public betas.  With codedefaults write .GlobalPreferences com.apple.scrollwheel.scaling -1/code, there should be no scroll wheel acceleration in apps (that use native scrolling).  <answer273193> After many years of frustration with macOS &amp; wheel mice, I've developed Smooze. You can use this app free for disabling acceleration ( you would only pay to use other features of the app)  ul litoggle the "Animate Scroll" to Off and you're good to go./li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qH9fb.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Smooze website  <comment315013> ...& I've been loving accelerated scroll for years, can't live without it - proves nothing but horses for courses, I guess;-) [SteerMouse](http://plentycom.jp/en/steermouse/) can adjust scrolling behaviour amongst other things, depending on the mouse you use [there's a v5 currently in beta, a bit buggy but free for a while, so you can judge for yourself] <comment315695> Welcome to Ask Different. Please provide more information about what USB Overdrive does to resolve the issue, like what settings need to be set, etc., so the answer is more useful. <comment316148> Thanks! I had scroll wheel issue after upgrading to macOS Sierra. I just installed the USB Overdrive (without any settings). And, my logitech wireless mouse just works on macOS Sierra as before ! <comment319495> Welcome to Ask Different.  We like answers to be more than just a single line.  Ideally, you want to explain why your answer is *right."  It also helps to provide links, citations, and/or screen shots.  Please review our help section [How to Answer](http://apple.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-answer) on writing good answers to questions <comment319566> The question was about scroll acceleration not interia. They are different things. <comment319567> Thanks for the idea, but I don't really want to give up smooth scrolling for disabling scroll acceleration. As I can understand, SteerMouse does scrolling by emulating cursor keys. <comment320258> What is the default value and how do I revert if I no longer want this change? <comment320259> You can always delete it with `defaults delete`. <comment320261> This doesn't work even after login. The sensitivity of the affected app is still too high compared to the unaffected ones. <comment320823> No, I've already said multiple times, that scroll interia and scroll acceleration are two different things. The first one is responsible for scrolling and decelerating the content when you lifted your fingers from the touchpad/Magic Mouse and the latter one accelerates the scroll speed when you keep scrolling in a given direction. <comment326600> That option is not available if you use a mouse. <comment330002> Thanks! For 2 days I was trying every piece of software but your small utility saved the day! <comment330385> Thanks for this, I feel like Yosemite had some amount of inertia still but it sure beats it not doing anything for a "click or two" of the mousewheel. Oh Apple. <comment330387> I have a feeling this scrolling interia dropdown no longer exists with certain mouse vendors since Yosemite. My G400s does not have this so I had to use the "discrete scroll" application as mentioned in another answer. <comment331049> I replied to the wrong question. I've updated my answer to be relevant anyway. <comment331820> This worked for me v10.12.1 and Logitech M500 mouse. <comment331964> Download **[SmoothScroll](http://www.smoothscroll.net)** if you also want a smooth animated scrolling experience with your mouse wheel (you can also disable the acceleration or change it to your own liking) <comment332064> This did not work for me: macbook pro 2016, sierra, deathadder chroma, safari, chrome <comment333469> Works perfectly, thanks! <comment333950> @galambalazs thanks, just bought SmoothScroll (I'm also using Steermouse to disable the pointer acceleration) <comment338528> @Emre-Yolcu Thank god. It's pathetic that I have to download a whole set of little scripts just to make simple things like this work properly. <comment350431> @Winterflags What's the mouse model? I've tested it on several Logitech mice including MX Master, Performance Mouse MX and some other cheaper modals without any issues without LCC installed. This issue was also never reported to me by the Smooze users. You should try to update LLC or better yet, remove it completely. <comment350435> @Winterflags It might be a problem with Sierra. Earlier versions had a bug that effected scrolling & Logitech mice. I'm currently on 10.12.3 with the same mouse, LLC not installed & Smooze installed and everything is working as it should. <comment350438> That's weird. I don't see a difference between Finder and other apps like Chrome \ Slack etc'.. There shouldn't be a difference. ( I don't have Pages installed) <comment350439> Let us [continue this discussion in chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/56491/discussion-between-winterflags-and-segev). <comment354888> I really hate it... have you tried scrolling a large list in a small 200px heigh container??? I'm going to train inner peace, focus and control with solitary monks for 10 years in order to scroll down 10 lines without wobbling the mouse wheel all the time! <comment356974> Does the app need to be run each time you boot the computer (sorry, new to MacOS)?  Or if the change is permanent, is there a way to "undo" it? <comment357104> @orrd Yes, it does need to be run each time you boot. If you want this to be automatic you may go to System Preferences  Users & Groups  Login Items and add DiscreteScroll to the list. If you want to undo the effect you may launch Activity Monitor, search for DiscreteScroll and force it to quit. I am planning to write a preference pane out of this program to make these operations more intuitive and include configuration options. <comment358315> @orrd You can use Smooze from my answer below. You can set it to open at Login and also decide the number of lines to move on each tick. Both features are free. Also, no nagging and no intrusive popups. <comment367722> This is a duplicate to @gklka's answer. <comment367723> This seems to have worked for me possibly *in combination* with disabling inertia and acceleration re the settings app paths given in other answers. Unchecking "Spring-loading delay" in the same settings area may also have done it. <comment372705> There's no inertia dropdown in my Sierra 10.12.5 (Logitech G600).
