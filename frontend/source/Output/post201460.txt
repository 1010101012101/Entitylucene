Should the pgrep command be available in OS X 10.7.5 <body> I posted this question on stackexchange and was told in no uncertain terms that my system was broken because pgrep did not exist in code/usr/bin/code  This has me worried, my system is stable and I am sure I did not 'accidentally' delete pgrep from the code/usr/bin/code directory.  I checked one of my other (newer systems) and indeed pgrep is available.  Is pgrep shipped by Apple in 10.7.5?  <answer201461> No, it's not shipped until 10.8 so you'll need to get it elsewhere for 10.7 and earlier.  Starting with OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion, the codepgrep/code command should be in code/usr/bin//code.  In a Terminal type the following and press enter.  precodewhereis pgrep /code/pre  Looking at the contents of the InstallESD.dmg from "Install Mac OS X Lion.app", codepgrep/code is not present.  <answer201462> codepgrep/code is a fairly new addition to OS X. It may not be available in 10.7 I would use pkgutil and check for a package id and install time or the command is not available in your version OS X.  precodepkgutil --file-info /usr/bin/pgrep /code/pre  <comment242845> that was the first command I used to check. ;-) <comment242846> I am looking for some documentation, which would confirm if it should or should not be there. <comment242850> Chanks! Much appreciated, laziness on part, I have the Install dmg for Lion as well, could have checked myself. <comment242851> Had I known that I wouldn't have gotten out of bed to go check. :) <comment242864> Awesome use of pgkutil - thanks! <comment242869> You are welcome.
