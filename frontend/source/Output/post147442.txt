Commandline tools is in multiple locations <body> I have commandline tools in /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/ and in ~/CommandLineTools  I thought they were included in Xcode now. Can I remove them and how would I?  I want to use both Xcode 6 and 5.1, How does that work with the CommandLineTools?  I know about xcode-select -s.  I'm thinking I could just delete those two directories and then use xcode-select.  I'm worried that there might be some paths set to the existing CommandLineTools, and I'm worried because peeking in the bin folders of xcode.app compared to the CommandLineTools folders I don't see all the same utilities.
