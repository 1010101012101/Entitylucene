does rsync work differently from Mac to Mac-formatted hard drive v. with Linux <body> I'm trying to figure out if this codersync/code behavior I'm noticing is specific to copying from a Mac to a Mac-formatted hard drive v. with e.g. a Synology system.  Typically, I've been using codersync/code to copy files from my my Mac to synology.  Suppose both folders are in sync.  I notice that when I do the code-avn/code dry run, it lists all the directories.  However, when I just noticed that when I tried to codersync/code to a Mac-formatted hard drive, it doesn't even list the directories.  Has anyone encountered this type of behavior before?  <comment223271> Can you add the specific commands you are using in each case (and also indicate which command is run on OS X and which on a Linux system)? Also `rsync --version` on both system would be interesting. <comment223537> `rsync` is version 2.6.9.  I'm running the `rsync` command on Terminal on my Mac.  Command is `rsync -av` source.directory target.directory
