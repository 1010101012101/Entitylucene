iPhone 5s won't charge <body> When I put my iPhone 5s on charge, it takes around 5 seconds to turn on and show the Apple logo. Then it turns on to show my lock screen and dies straight away.   It has been doing the same thing for the past 4 hours. What should I do?  <answer251217> We'll need to troubleshoot the charging method first - then the device itself.  h1Troubleshooting the charging method, adapter, cable:/h1  ol listrongCompare packaging and writing on the cable:/strong     To identify counterfeit or uncertified cables and accessories, look carefully at the accessory's packaging and at the accessory itself. Certified third-party accessories have the MFi logo on their packaging. An Apple Lightning to USB cable has "Designed by Apple in California" and either "Assembled in China," "Assembled in Vietnam," or "Indústria Brasileira" on the cable about seven inches from the USB connector. You'll see a 12-digit serial number at the end of this text. /li listrongCompare connectors and laser etchings:/strong     You can use the Lightning connector, USB connector, and laser etchings to identify counterfeit or uncertified Lightning accessories.
