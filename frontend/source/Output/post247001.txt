Can I run the OS X installer even after I delete main disk <body> I'm trying to reinstall OS X on my girlfriend's Mac and when I go to recovery menu and select to install OS X from the menu, the system proceeds to start download emcomponents/em, which fails.  I've thought about using disk utility to delete the main drive and then mount a new one and try the OS X installation from the recovery menu again in hopes it just fails because there isn't enough space for the emcomponents/em. But I am afraid to try it because I worry the recovery image will be deleted as well and I won't be able to run the OS X reinstallation after I have deleted and recreated the main disk.  strongIs this a real risk or should I go ahead at try it?/strong emComponents/em seems to be a lot to download so I'm thinking it probably is the OS image so me clearing the drive completely shouldn't be an issue, but I have no experience with anything Apple so prefer to have people to blame after my girlfriend asks why did I brick her Mac.  <answer247082> If you can boot normally into OS X then create an OS X USB Installer. See, Create a bootable installer for OS X (quoted below) or if not see, How to reinstall OS X.  hr     Use the 'createinstallmedia' command in Terminal      ol   liDownload the OS X installer from the Mac App Store. Quit the installer if it opens automatically after downloading. The installer   will be in your Applications folder./li   liMount your USB flash drive or other volume. You could also use a secondary internal partition./li   liOpen the Terminal app, which is in the Utilities folder of your Applications folder./li   liUse the codecreateinstallmedia/code command in Terminal to create the bootable installer. Examples of this command are in the next section.   For detailed usage instructions, make sure that the appropriate   Install OS X app is in your Applications folder, then enter one of the   following paths in Terminal:/li   /ol      Path for El Capitan:  precode/Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ El\ Capitan.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia /code/pre      Path for Yosemite:  precode/Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ Yosemite.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia /code/pre      Path for Mavericks:   precode/Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ Mavericks.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia /code/pre      Examples      This is the basic syntax of the command.
