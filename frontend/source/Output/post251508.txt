Could not sign in Youtube on Apple TV 4 <body> To sign in the YouTube app on my apple TV 4, it ask me to go   youtube.com/active  When I go to that page, the page says     "This account has been terminated for violating YouTube or Google's Terms of Service."   However, I could use my account on YouTube on other platforms just fine. I contacted Google and filled in a form to check my account status. I got e-mail replay says my account still active. Does anybody faced this  situationï¼Ÿ What could I do?
