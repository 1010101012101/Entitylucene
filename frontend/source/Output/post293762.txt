iPhone 7 home button not working? <body> I broke my iPhone 7 screen the day before the case came in the mail, just my luck.  A few days later the home button stopped working. I went to get the screen replaced (there are no Apple stores near me so it was a local repair shop).  The guy told me if I bought a new home button he'd replace it for free.  I ordered the button, but I just discovered that the issue isn't the button itself.  When I double tap it, it still brings the screen down.  I believe it's just the pressure sensor that isn't working.  What part would I need to fix this?  Would it be a new taptic engine?  All of the vibrations and haptics are still working.  <comment370712> If anyone other than Apple changes the button, the TouchID will stop working, so I'd just take it to Apple...
