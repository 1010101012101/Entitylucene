Turn down TX power on AirPort? <body> Our floor has a blind spot so we needed to place an AirPort to cover two rooms. The AirPort in this particular room is transmitting at a higher power than needed, and its bleeding onto some areas where its unwanted. (This was found with Wifi Stumbler).  I'm running the AirPort Utility on OS X Mavericks. The room in question has an AirPort Express. I've looked in the AirPort Utility, but I don't see where I can set TX power.  How do I turn down TX power on AirPort?  Is there some sort of secret knock to use with AirPort to get into advanced settings? Or should I be using something else to configure them?  <answer171830> In order to set the TX Power you need an older version of the Airport utility which is available here.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PhRGt.png" alt="wifitxpower"  Navigate to your base station  Manual Setup  AirPort  Wireless  Wireless Network Options. Once there, choose a transmit power that’s lower than 100% (you can choose between 10%, 25%, 50%, and 100%).   Remember to Update your configuration when you’re done.   hr  <comment202236> Perfect, thank you very much.
