Will my pictures be erased if I restart my iPod? <body> I need to know if my pictures are going to be erased if I restart my iPod.  <answer196165> Only restarting you iPod will not erase your pictures. But for your Convenience you can plugin in you iPod on your computer or mac and make a backup with iTunes.  It you reset your iPod than your data will be lost. So make a backup with iTunes before.  <comment234292> Do you mean restart as in hold down the start button until iOS reboots or do you mean reset if through iTunes or have it recognized on a different iTunes? <comment234342> You need to explain more about what you mean by restart.
