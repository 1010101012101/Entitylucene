Meaning of square brackets in a Preview search <body> I recently needed to search for a string enclosed in square brackets in a PDF document. So I typed code[concept]/code into the search field (including the square brackets).  The result surprised me, as I got a list of pages containing the word codeconcept/code with all letters contained in that word highlighted in yellow.   I haven't been able to find any documentation of this "feature" - or any other special syntax in the search field.  What is the straight explanation for this behaviour, if any?  <answer127016> Sounds like the search is actually a Regular Expression search, and by enclosing your search term in brackets, instead of searching for the word 'concept' you were searching for the presence of the letters 'c', 'o', 'n', 'e', 'p' and 't'.  <answer253000> It seems that the open bracket code[/code is the problem so if you search for codeconcept]/code then you'll at least get items that end in that sequence.  <comment148766> I had that thought, too, but it seems to me that it only applies to pages that contain the string "concept" - otherwise it should select all pages, as they all contain at least one occurrence of the characters in the bracket. <comment148767> You are right, I did a test and it's a very odd result. <comment371524> The question seems to be asking what the OP did, not what he's trying to do. <comment371527> It might be a bug that has been solved in the meantime, but I can't reproduce it (macOS 10.12.6). <comment371528> But it *does* provide some kind of workaround, which could be useful to future readers.
