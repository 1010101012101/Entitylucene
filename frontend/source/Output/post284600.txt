Problem daisy chaining two external displays on MBP <body> The setup is the following:  ul liApple MBP Retina 13 Early 2015/li liOSX 10.11.6/li liMonitor #1: Dell U2715H (2560x1440 60hz)/li liMonitor #2: Dell U2408WFP (1980x1200 60hz)/li /ul  I'm trying to connect both displays to the MBP using daisy chain (MST).  MBP is connected to monitor #1 with a Mini-DP to DP cable (came with monitor #1). Monitor #1 is connected to monitor #2 using DP to DP cable.  When everything is connected, OSX detects monitor #1 but not monitor #2. Can't find any relevant option in the display preferences.  Same setup (monitor with cables) runs fine with Windows 7 in another desktop PC.  Apple states that MST should be supported in my MBP. Not sure if this also means that daisy chain should work as well.  Connecting monitor #2 via HDMI works fine (ie both displays are detected and works ok).
