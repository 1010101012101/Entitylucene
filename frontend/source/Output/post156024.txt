Macintosh HD not showing in disk utility! <body> First a flashing file came up on my mac. When i go into disk utility's and it just shows disk0 and Mac OS X Base system.   I've followed everything that I've found on the net:    ul liI've tried to start in safe mode (shift on start up)  /li liI've tried fsck but it won't go past the flashing file  /li liI've also tried ctrl + V on start up, ctrl + S and ctrl + P +R.  /li /ul  Still nothings happened so are there any other options i could try?  <comment183529> Please boot to the Recovery HD and add the output of `diskutil list` executed in the `Terminal` to your question. <comment183532> sorry im not sure what you mean by the output. could you give me a direction. sorry im useless haha. <comment183533> sure:     machine:~ user$ `diskutil list`  **output:** /dev/disk0    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *750.2 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI                         209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:                  Apple_HFS System                  749.3 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3 <comment183534> probably you booted to either a `Recovery HD`, `Internet Recovery Mode` or a `thumb drive containing a base system`. In the menu bar you should find something like Utilities/Terminal. Start Terminal and enter `diskutil list`and enter. Copy the output and add it to your question. <comment183536> You may also add what you did before or what you want to do (e.g. you deleted a partition before installing a new system, you got a new hard disk etc.)
