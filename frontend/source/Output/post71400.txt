How to focus on list of found files after search in Finder using the keyboard with full keyboard access activated? <body> I like using the keyboard as much as possible. In particular, I'd like to be able to activate a search, type my search term, press a key to move to the search list, and then use cursor keys to navigate to my search result.  I can trigger a search in Finder in a number of ways:   ul liCmd+F/li liAlt+Cmd+Space/li /ul  When I search "This mac" pressing the tab key 6 times enables keyboard access to the search list. When I search within a particular folder, pressing tab gets me as far as "This Mac" and then the tab key stops working.  Pressing the tab key six times is not a particularly efficient option. That the tab option does not always work even that does not work all the time  After a little exploration I learnt that if I disabled full-keyboard access in codepreferences - keyboard - keyboard shortcuts - keyboard &amp; text/code it only took one tab to activate search results. However, in general I like have full keyboard access.  I was hoping that would be some key that could be used to focus on the list of files in finder. Thus, my question is:  strongHow can I focus on a list of found files after search in Finder using the keyboard with full keyboard access activated?/strong  <answer71407> An ideal solution would be a single key press that is relatively intuitive and consistent with other keyboard interface rules. Nonetheless, I have found a couple of hacks that seems to work.   ul likbdCmd/kbd+kbd[/kbd then kbdCmd/kbd+kbd]/kbd: This navigates back then forward. After this has occurred the focus is on the file list. A mild nuisance with this option is that the search is refreshed, which can lead to a brief lag./li likbdCmd/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbdG/kbd followed by kbdescape/kbd: This opens the go to folder dialog box; escape exits the dialog box and returns focus on the file list. /li /ul
