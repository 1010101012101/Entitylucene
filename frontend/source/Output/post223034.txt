How to Command-X files on OS X El Capitan? <body> I noticed that Command-X (cut and paste) is greyed out on finder in El Capitan. Is there any way to get it back?  EDIT: WITHOUT Command-Option-V. If possible, way to map command-option-v to command-x would be great....  <answer223038> Just copy the file as normal with kbdcommand/kbd+kbdc/kbd and then when you past usebr kbdcommand/kbd+kbdoption/kbd+kbdv/kbd and it will paste the file, and also cut it from its original location
