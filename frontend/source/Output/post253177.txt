iTunes, AppleTV and AirPort time capsule frustration! <body> Although 100% of the world is convinced that all apple products work seemlessly together. It doesn't seem to be working for me.  here is my setup. I have an 2TB airport time capsule on which I have plenty movie files. I have added all these files to my itunes movies.  Now I have turned on home sharing and my apple TV can connect to itunes and it can play the movies.  So far so good. Now if I try to repeat this after a few days, apple TV will throw an error at every movie.  Now if I go to tunes and drag and drop all movie files into itunes it can play the movie again.   But i wonder why do I have to drag and drop all movie files everytime into itunes for apple tv to play the file?  What goes wrong? its not that I am moving the files on the time capsule.  <comment315092> "throw an error"... what error?
