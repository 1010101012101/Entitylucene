How to remap 'Context Menu' key on external keyboard? <body> I'm using a Cherry G80 (excellent 'clicky' keyboard btw.) on my Macbook Air. Everything works fine, I can use and remap all keys using Ukelele1 or directly in Emacs.  The only key behaving strange is the codeContext Menu/code2 Key.  It returns the same Unicode sequence as codeControl-P/code.   This is the output of codeKey Codes/code3 when pressing the codeContext Menu/code key:  precodeKey Down Characters:  Unicode:        16 / 0x10 Keys:        Key Code:   110 / 0x6e Modifiers:  256 / 0x100 /code/pre  This is the output for codeControl-P/code:  precodeKey Down Characters:  Unicode:        16 / 0x10 Keys:       ‚åÉP Key Code:   35 / 0x23 Modifiers:  262401 / 0x40101 /code/pre  (Notice the difference in 'Keys')  My goal is to use it directly in Emacs or be able to swap it to some other (modifier) key. Is there any way to do this? I can't find a way to bring Ukelele to do that.  <answer55568> The easiest way is to customize the key layout. You can do this by hand but I'd suggest using the utility Ukelele. I haven't used this on Lion so I don't know how well it works. If you want to do it manually (which I've done in the past as well) here's the tech note from Apple on how to do it.  <answer56438> Bad news. Apple's XML DTD format that Ukelele targets does not support modifiers outside of shift keys, option keys, control keys, and command keys.  As @Lri suggested KeyRemap4MacBook supports mapping the codeContext Menu Key/code, which it calls the codeApplication Key/code. In KeyRemap4MacBook's preferences go to codeFor PC Users/code - codeChange PC Application Key/code to see all the supported options. Mappings that may be of use for Emacs: codeFn Key/code;  codeShift_L Key/code; codeOption_L Key/code; codeControl_L Key/code; and, codeCommand_L Key/code.  <comment63920> Please read my question carefully. I can't figure out to make Ukelele do what I want. <comment64351> You could probably use [KeyRemap4MacBook](http://pqrs.org/macosx/keyremap4macbook/) to map it to another key. None of the questions here ([1](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/32715/) [2](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/41201) [3](http://superuser.com/questions/18557) [4](http://superuser.com/questions/267604)) mention any way to get an actual context menu key on OS X though. <comment64939> Thanks for this explanation. KeyRemap4Macbook seems to be working. While I don't really like some application messing with my input, this is an acceptable solution!
