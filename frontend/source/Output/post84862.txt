App store updates won't download <body> I changed my Apple ID password.  I can log successfully into my Apple account using my new password online.  I can download songs from iTunes using my new password. But When I go into App Store, and select "Updates". I click on Update tab for App, I get prompted for my Apple ID Password. I enter my new password, click OK, the "UPDATE" tab flashes from "INSTALLING" back to "UPDATE". Update  does not complete!   This happens on both my iPhone and iPad and I can't get past it.   How can I fix this?  <answer84901> Did you try via the settings  iTunes and App Store? Click Apple ID and logout and back in. Login again there, and that did the trick for me.  EDIT: My problem was solved when I removed iCloud from my iPad and iPhone and logged in with new credentials.  <comment97711> Have you tried to power off and then power on your devices?
