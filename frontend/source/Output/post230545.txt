How do I restore an account that was not deleted? <body> I recently had to reboot my computer, and when it finished booting my account was gone (it was not showing in the log in screen)! I got onto the admin account and found that although the user was not deleted, there are a lot of red minus signs:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IkjmU.png" alt="enter image description here"  How do I fix this?   I noticed that it does not work quite like what is described here: https://support.apple.com/kb/PH22002?locale=en_US  It's more like this: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4171806?start=0&amp;tstart=0  I am running OS X El Capitan 10.11.3  <answer230548> Log-in as admin user and open Terminal. Then enter  precodesudo dscl . read /Users/lost_username /code/pre  Replace lost_username by the short name of the "hidden" or "lost" user.  If the user is still there check if the account is hidden:  precodesudo dscl . read /Users/lost_username IsHidden /code/pre  If you get the following response: emNo such key: IsHidden/em you have a real problem. If it yields: emdsAttrTypeNative:IsHidden: 1/em your user is just hidden.  Unhide your user with:  precodesudo dscl . create /Users/lost_username IsHidden 0 /code/pre  or delete the key with  precodesudo dscl . delete /Users/lost_username IsHidden /code/pre  You have to reboot after entering either of the last two commands to unhide the account.  hr  If you get em DS Error: -14136 (eDSRecordNotFound)/em after entering the first command your user was deleted in the directory nodes.  strongQuick and dirty fix:/strong  List the users' UniqueIDs with:  precodedscl . -list /Users UniqueID /code/pre  Usually the first account created after installing OS X gets the 501, the second 502 and so on. Check for gaps (e.g. 502 is missing).  Rename (shorten) the abandoned user folder. Create a new user with the old user name (lost_username) and the old password. Check the UniqueID of the new user:  precodesudo dscl . -read /Users/lost_username UniqueID /code/pre  Compare this UniqueID with the missing one. If they aren't the same, change the UniqueID of the newly created user to the missing one:  precodesudo dscl . -create /Users/lost_username UniqueID 502 #choose the missing ID here /code/pre  Remove the newly created user folder (with the name lost_username). Rename the previously renamed (old and full with data) user folder to lost_username.  Log-in as lost_username.
