How do I remove a password from the root user account? <body> I've enabled a password for root via command line with:  precodesudo passwd /code/pre  but I can not use  precodesudo passwd -d passwd: illegal option -- d /code/pre  There is no modification to the root user with any GUI tool.  <comment313456> The GUI tool is found at the Apple web site: [Enabling and using the "root" user in OS X](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204012). <comment313567> Thanks @DavidAnderson, That worked great. <comment313612> @DavidAnderson, Thanks, I didn't find that post because I wasn't looking for 'enable' but disable, but also CLI options.
