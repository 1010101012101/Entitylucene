Force Lion to boot 32 bit mode <body> How can I force OSX Lion to boot into 32bit mode without having to hold 3 + 2 down on boot?  I have to use the Cisco VPN Client to connect back into work and since upgrading it no longer works on 64bit. Cisco have dropped support for the client as well.  <answer18224> You can modify the com.apple.Boot.plist (found in /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration) file with start parameters and also the desired architecture (if you add that section to the file). See the man page here.  <answer18226> There is a Cisco VPN client built-in into Mac OS X. I am currently using it successfully to connect to my university VPN network from home.  Add it as an interface in Network Preferences -   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WuXTR.png" alt="enter image description here"  Quickly connect to the VPN from the menubar -   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nozIz.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment19891> The OSX client requires a shared secret which the VPN connection doesn't have. <comment19898> Does using *sudo systemsetup -setkernelbootarchitecture i386* to set this, instead of editing the plist file, work in Lion? <comment19907> @digital It does. Under advanced options. I use it everyday <comment19924> The VPN setup itself doesn't have one to my knowledge and the OSX VPN connection requires it. Should have worded it better.
