What does webcontentfilter.kext do? <body> So I'm learning about writing Kernel Extensions and while I was looking for examples I stumbled across codewebcontentfilter.kext/code.  I gathered from this post Website gets blocked by webfilterproxyd even without website restriction that it has something to do with Parental Controls, which as a child in his mid-30's, I am whole-heartedly against.  Upon deeper examination, inside the kernel extensions executable code/System/Library/Extensions/webcontentfilter.kext/Contents/MacOS/webcontentfilter/code I found the following phrase which gave me pause.  precode`================================  ======== HolyInquisition =======  ================================` /code/pre  Without actually disassembling it (I can't disable SIP right now, long story.) it looks like a bunch of functions, name with the prefix codeholy_/code for creating/filtering/closing sockets, and some hooks to the factory standard macOS programs. Which would make sense for parental controls. Just wondering if this is programmer humor, or if I should throw the MacBook in the water and see if floats.  Also, I would really like to know in as gross detail as possible how codewebcontentfilter.kext/code works. That would be nice too. It's what I'm here for.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HR9Dh.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment352254> And your problem is...? <comment352261> I want to know how it works, in gross detail. My only problem is that I'm insatiably curious. I also want to know how the 'HolyInquisition' library name. That's a pretty intense name for a set of networking functions. Feel free to down vote. <comment352304> Your insatiable curiosity is admirable, @knotech, I live my life much the same way.
