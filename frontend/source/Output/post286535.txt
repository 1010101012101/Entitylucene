Does the 15" 2015 MacBook Pro have a dedicated H.264 encoding chip? <body> I'm live recording and mixing video with the mimoLive application and it always cranks the fans and pushes the CPU to the limit so I want to know if it the 2015 MBP 15" will use the CPU to encode to H.264 for recording to drive (less file size by a lot) or to record to Apple ProRes 422 codec (massive files but less CPU load).  I'm told some Macs have a H.264 encoding/decoding chip and others don't. I had thought even the integrated Intel GPUs had H.264 optimization but not sure.
