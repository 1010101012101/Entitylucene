What the difference between iTunes and App Store search results? <body> I see difference in positions of applications in search result of iTunes (on PC and web) and App Store (on devices).  What is the key difference on it and why does it differ?  <comment251217> Are the results exactly repeatable on each? Otherwise it might just have an element of randomisation. <comment251262> @Tetsujin, that's exactly the problem: the results are not the same, but also they are not random.  And, of course, results of search in App Store on devices should be considered more reliable, because people seach and install applications with devices.
