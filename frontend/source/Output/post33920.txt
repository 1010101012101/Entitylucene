Is is possible to go invisible in iChat? <body> I want to be able to go invisible in iChat, like I can via Gmail. How can I do this?  <answer33926> Yes, just click on the Green light that says available and you will had all these options as in the picture below.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Fbj0K.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer34919> When using Gmail in iChat before 10.7 you can't go invisible. I'm using Adium to be able to go invisible when I login via Gmail.  <comment38741> iChat doesn't show `Invisible` for me! <comment38750> Yup, I don't see it either. <comment39112> What version of OS X are you running? I'me running 10.7 Lion <comment39822> More important than which version of OS X, what service (AIM? Y!? MSN? Jabber?) are you connecting too? In the case of Jabber, at least knowing who the host is will help. <comment39823> Not working for me either on 10.7 Lion. I've got Jabber on Google Talk, Bonjour and Facebook configured. <comment40683> Be reminded that the invisible feature only displays if you have MobileMe setup. <comment43224> Ok, thanks so much for your answer!
