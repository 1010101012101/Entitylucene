Possible to backup External Disk to Time Capsule regardless which machine it's connected to? <body> Here's the scenario: I have two MacBook Pros (codeFoo/code and codeBar/code), and their drive's are both called codeMacintosh HD/code. I have a Time Capsule called codeTime Capsule/code, which is used to back up both codeFoo/code and codeBar/code. I also have an external disk called codeStuff/code which I connect to both codeFoo/code and codeBar/code.  Is it possible to have codeStuff/code backed up to codeTime Capsule/code in such a way that regardless of whether codeStuff/code is connected to either codeFoo/code or codeBar/code, the same destination on codeTime Capsule/code is used? I.e. can an external disk connected to two different computers be backed up to the same Time Machine disk without duplication?  Seems like this might be possible with codetmutil/code but I haven't been able to figure it out.  <answer137268> well good question and well described. It is possible to BackUp 2 Macbooks codeFoo/codeand codeBar/codeto strongone/strong TimeMachine Disk.   I had some problems with SnowLeopard but with Mountain Lion it was a lot better and now with Mavericks it is working fine.   So if you have Mavericks installed on both it is no hassle so far in my Envirmonent (have 4 Macbooks and one TimeMachine Disk (in the Network))  Example of may TM Diks  precodeTimeMachine |- Macbook Pro Martin |- iMac Martin |- MacPro Martin |- Macbook Air  /code/pre  sup Folder has been renamed in this example /sup  So the Devices are seperated in Folders on your TM Disk.   <comment163174> Apparently not well described since this is not the question that I asked. I'm fully aware it's possible to backup two different macs to the same Time Capsule. The question is whether it's possible to backup up one external disk, attached to either of two macs to one Time Capsule, without replicating the data of the external disk.
