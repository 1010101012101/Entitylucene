My Screen Saver is awry & need help <body> I have an iMac 21.5" 2.5 GHz Intel Core i5 Macintosh HD - Yosemite. My Screen Saver comes up with foreign words and gobbledygook that I don't understand.  Went into  Finder/library/Screen Savers (this is what is in my Applications) to see what I could do but there is nothing in this folder.  This looks bogus to me. Do you agree and what should I do?  <answer192580> To change your strongScreen Saver/strong go to   precode ï£¿ &gt; System Preferences... &gt; Desktop &amp; Screen Saver... /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hHC9I.png" alt="Icon"  From there you can set the screen saver settings.  I suspect from your question (although it is not clear) that you have the strongWord of the Day/strong screen saver selected.  You can check it's settings or change the screen saver all together.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TLxll.png" alt="Screen Saver settings"  <answer192587> Screensavers were developed do deal with issues that affected CRT displays. As nobody makes them anymore, and LCD displays don't have the same issues, we no longer need screensavers. A screensaver running on a flat screen monitor just looks pretty - there is no difference to the operation.  Open System Preferences.  Go to Desktop - Screen Saver and set the "Start after:" value to Never.  Go to Energy Saver and set "Turn display off..." to whatever value you want.  This actually powers down the screen illumination and most of the GPU.  <comment229204> Up vote for the CRT reference!  Yep, just eye candy.  Legacy stuff. <comment229247> CRTs are still made, and burn-in is still an issue with some non-CRT monitors. <comment229296> @tubedogg CRTs are still made, but not for computer monitors. Apple (and pretty much every other domestic computer manufacturer) hasn't sold a CRT in 10 years. The burn-in issue apples to things like plasma displays, also not commonly found on Apple products.
