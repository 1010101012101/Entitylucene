How can I sort by date consistently in the Finder? <body> I would like to use the "arrange by date" feature of Finder on Mountain Lion (version 10.8.2, all current system updates installed) and view the result in a consistent manner from "newer" to "older".  In this thread there is an example for what the "arrange by date" option does:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dXK7v.png" alt="Screenshot of Finder"  In this example (I found the same behavior on my machine) the table sections are sorted with strongnewer items at the top/strong and strongolder items at the bottom/strong. However, within each table section, the sort order is strongnewer items at the bottom/strong and strongolder items at the top/strong.  Is there a way to way to arrange everything in a consistent order and keep the sections for grouping the files into date categories?  <answer66675> When in finder, go to "view" in the menubar and then select "Show view options" (or something similar, or alternately just press cmd+J) When presented with the new window configure the options how you like them, and then press the "use as default", and now everything should be consistent.  <comment78529> Ah, I see the issue -- the "Sort by" and "Arrange by" options are distinct and can be set independently of each other. Setting both indeed resolves the problem, thanks for the solution!
