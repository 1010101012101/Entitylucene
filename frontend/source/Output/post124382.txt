iPhone 3GS no sim error <body> I got an iPhone 3G from a friend and it is showing "no sim card" and I know the sim card is good and it won't let me do anything but phone start up. Can anyone help please?  <answer135431> Restore that iPhone. If the problem persists: take it to a repair shop. It is probably a hardware problem. I had the same problem myself.  <comment160558> Is the phone SIM locked?
