Is there an Alfred Workflow to install and view Alfred workflows? <body> I want a workflow like the cask / brew workflow for Alfred workflows. Does this already exists?  e.g. auto completion, viewing and installing and removing right from alfred instead of searching google to find and install and the preferences to remove.  <answer186457> There are websites like http://alfredworkflow.com and Packal which have hundreds of available workflows which you can download for free.  There is strongWorkflow Searcher/strong Alfred Workflow which lets you find and install alfred workflows available on http://www.alfredworkflow.com/ from within Alfred itself. which you can download from here  There is also awm (Alfred Workflow Manager) which lets you find and install workflow found on Packal using the terminal. It requires you to have strongnode/strong and the node package manager strongnpm/strong installed.
