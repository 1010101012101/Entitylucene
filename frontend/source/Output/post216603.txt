Is it a scam or worth to track iphone using IMEI? <body> I have googled for tracking of an iPhone I found iphonetrace , They provide tracking report on the basis of strongserial number/strong or strongIMEI/strong strongnumber/strong I just want to know it is really a worth or a scam  It is paid service and strong9$/strong per one time tracking charge.  <answer216624> It doesn't look like they're really tracking anything here. They're just giving you dates that a phone moved from carrier to carrier or gets a new SIM card. They claim this is useful because you will then be armed with the knowledge to reach out to the proper authorities.   Here's the rub:  to my knowledge a database with all activations doesn't exist other than internal within Apple (every iPhone "phones home" [pardon the pun] when you re-activate). In the past, sites similar to this one were just guessing. I'm not sure if that's what's happening here, but I don't see what they're selling to be useful at all.  <answer221258> I tried with this company when I lost my iPhone 5s and they couldn't tell me where my phone was EVEN though th 'findmyiphone' ' was activated!,they STILL charged me the money but after I complained I was reimbursed,by the way I got my phone back 4 days later!,it was apparently found the day I lost it but as I had all security measures in place it couldn't be used! It was only returned to me when I put up 'LOST' notices in various shops etc offering a reward that it was returned!,,I reckon if the person who found it had been able to get into it then I wouldn't have got it back!,there was a message sent to the phone via my iPad saying 'this phone is locked &amp; cannot be used,please phone ????????,there was a warning sound played EVERY few minutes so whoever had the phone HAD TO HAVE heard the warning sounds AND read the message!,these companies are a complete waste of money mate!  <comment261828> See the answer to http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/108257/detecting-lost-iphone-using-imei-number?rq=1 as well
