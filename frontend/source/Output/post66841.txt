iTunes 10.7.0.21 (and earlier) on Windows 7 64bit crashes when converting to AAC <body> [Also posted in the Apple Support Communities, where it has not received any responses so far.]  iTunes crashes very consistently whenever I try to convert songs to AAC format.  Sometimes I can get one or two songs to convert before it crashes, sometimes it's on the first song.  I have had this problem for over a year now, on every version of iTunes since I first installed it.  I have tried reinstalling iTunes over itself, uninstalling it and installing it again, etc.  I've been through Google and Apple Support Communities multiple times and none of the suggestions have helped.  I am hoping someone has had this problem and found a solution that they can share with me.  <comment78735> Would this not likely a problem with QuickTime rather than iTunes? <comment78736> @Justsomeguy - Very possibly, since I assume iTunes uses QuickTime for conversion, but I never use QuickTime independently of iTunes, so the possibility hadn't really occurred to me.
