Why my recently deleted folder is always 0 and 120 items have not been uploaded to icloud? <body> It is quite strange during the past 1 and 1/2 months. It's because that my  photos in codeMoments/code have not been uploaded to icloud. What's worse, my coderecently deleted/code folder is always 0 when delete one from Moments.   I currently have 120 items have not been uploaded to iCloud. I don't know how to deal with it. Can you help me?  iPhone 6, iOS 10.2
