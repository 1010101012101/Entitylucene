Deleting files takes forever with FileVault enabled <body> Deleting files takes forever with FileVault enabled, is there anything I can do to speed this up or change the 'secure deletion' setting so it doesn't write over every bite several times for deleted files?  When deleting anything in the order of gigabytes it can take hours/days to delete...  <comment145093> Are you talking about the original FileVault?  This is not something I've seen with FileVault 2. <comment145138> This is on Mavericks, yeah
