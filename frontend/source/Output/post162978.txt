Display playlist by album instead of by song on iPhone <body> I have an iPhone 5S. I want to see my playlist by albums instead of by songs. When I add an album of songs to the playlist, it shows all the songs. I can do it on iTunes on the computer but it doesn't seem to allow you to show playlist by album instead of by song.  <answer162979> Unfortunately you can't do this on your iPhone, but on a mac when you select the playlist you can go to the top right corner and change it from songs to albums for them to be sorted by album.  <answer204278> This option needs to be added on the iPhone.   I like sorting through the music on my phone in Album view and its a big hassle when I have 800+ single songs in my "Gym" Playlist that get lumped in with the full albums I have on the phone.  This has led me to make a separate playlist for the full albums...but you can't view them in any other way except as a list of SONGS in the playlist....its like..damn you can't win.  <comment246234> Welcome to Ask Different!
