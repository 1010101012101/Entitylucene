Is it possible to read iBooks without an iOS device? <body> I no longer have an iPhone or iPad, but still have books in my iTunes account that I would like to read. Is there a program for OS X that will allow me to read iBooks without an iOS device?  I am familiar with calibre, but the main issue here is the DRM.  <answer37466> At this time Unfortunately, no.  There is no Mac OS X application for iBooks.  You may want to submit a feature request to Apple.  <answer37467> Apple has released an strongFAQ for iBooks/strong where em(as of January 2012)/em, it says underbr emAbout iBooks and the iBookstore &#x2192; What are the requirements to use iBooks?:/em     You can use iBooks on iPad. You can also use iBooks on iPhone or iPod touch with iOS 4 or later.     Until OS X Mavericks was released with iBooks for OS X, the answer was strongno/strong.  <answer37471> If you copy a purchased epub format book out to the Finder, you can load it into calibre, but when you try to read it, the App's embedded reader tells you:     This Book is locked by strongDRM/strong.

Despite rumor, Thursday's education-related event produced no OSX-based iBooks reader. So the answer is still no, and will likely remain no for the forseeable future.  <answer98146> OS X 10.9 Mavericks includes an iBooks app that allows you to read any documents - including purchased books or your own pdfs - that you had in iBooks for iOS.  Mavericks is a free upgrade available for the following systems, and was released on 22 October, 2013 through the Mac App Store.  From OS X Mavericks : System Requirements     To install Mavericks, you need one of these Macs:      iMac (Mid-2007 or later) MacBook (13-inch Aluminum, Late 2008),   (13-inch, Early 2009 or later) MacBook Pro (13-inch, Mid-2009 or   later), MacBook Pro (15-inch or 17-inch, Mid/Late 2007 or later)   MacBook Air (Late 2008 or later) Mac Mini (Early 2009 or later) Mac   Pro (Early 2008 or later) Xserve (Early 2009)  Your Mac also needs:      OS X Mountain Lion, Lion, or Snow Leopard v10.6.8 already installed 2   GB or more of memory 8 GB or more of available space   <comment125461> This is now available in OS X Mavericks. http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/98146/10033 <comment133376> Answer correct at time of writing but answer is now yes with iBooks app in Mavericks <comment133399> No... now. There's speculation that Apple will be responding to Amazon's release of their Kindle reader with an OSX-based iBooks reader at Thursday's education-related event. So you may want to watch the details of whatever news comes out of that. <comment133400> Sadly, this did not happen. <comment133401> Calibre will connect with your iTunes library, however iBooks are protected by DRM and not readable outside of the iBooks app. <comment133402> No such announcement was made today at the Apple event, so the answers remains as 'No' for now. <comment133540> One thing I like about the new iBooks app is that it has the ability to load my own ePub and pdf formatted work/books/documents, etc. I find that so useful, that I'm contemplating moving from kindle.app. I never thought I would.
