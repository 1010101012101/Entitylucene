NTFS and Veracrypt VS HFS+ Encrypted? <body> I want to create a backup disk where I occasionally connect it to my macOS and copy important things manually.  I may also connect this disk to Windows in rare cases.  I also want to encrypt the disk/container.  I accept to lose the ability to use this disk on Windows. (which may occur if I choose HFS+ encrypted)  What is the most reliable and fast way to achieve this? Using NTFS and Veracrypt? Using HFS+ Encrypted?  <answer250520> If you format the disk exFAT you will have a disk that is read and writable on both systems. Then on the mac side you can create an encrypted disk image on that drive that is only accessible on a Mac. You can also create an encrypted .zip file on the PC (with 3rd party software) that is only readable on a PC.  Alternatively, if you don't mind partitioning the drive, you can create a drive with one NTFS and one HFS+ partition on it then you can encrypt both at the file system level and each will be accessible only on their corresponding operating system.
