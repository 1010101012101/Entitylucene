GUI for C++ on Mac OS X <body> What GUI or framework should I use for both 2D and 3D applications? I'd like to use C++ as much as possible versus other pseudo languages such as Objective C. I'm confused so if this question makes no sense, just please let me know.  <answer41576> You can use Xcode for standard C++ programs. You can also use it with OpenGL.  You can also use Eclipse for C++. Here's how to setup OpenGL in Eclipse CDT for Mac.  <comment47128> I want to try something more rather than Terminal (command line) app. <comment47133> This question doesn't make much sense. And I think it's off topic here. You should try Stack Overflow. <comment47156> Questions about programming, development, and listing your apps on the App Store are off topic for Ask Different. <comment47158> I'm also having trouble understanding this. Are you looking for an IDE, or a framework for creating GUIs for your apps? The first option would be on topic here, but the second is off topic (programming isn't on topic here). If your question is a software recommendation for an IDE, feel free to edit for clarity and flag this so we can reopen it for you.
