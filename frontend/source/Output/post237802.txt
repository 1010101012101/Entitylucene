Will iCloud Remote Wipe of MacBook erase system restore on different hardware? <body> My 2012 MacBook Pro was stolen, but it had Find My Mac enabled through iCloud prior to that event. I have not issued a remote wipe with hopes that I'd be able to use Find My Mac to track it down. Alas, it has not come online and I've now purchased another 2012 MacBook Pro to replace it. I luckily have a full system backup on my Time Capsule I can restore to this new MacBook. I am considering issuing the Remote Wipe command to my stolen Mac, but I am concerned that this might cause my new Mac to be wiped instead after I try to restore it, at which point iCloud will consider it's job done and remove the reference to the old MacBook. I know it has a different serial number. Is that enough or will it consider it to be the same device after I do the full system restore?  Also, what about other software such as Dropbox, which I've also issued a separate request for a remote wipe? Will I find that to start wiping itself after a system restore?  <comment291575> It should only erase the stolen Mac, provided it eventually comes online. Hopefully you had it password protected. It knows the difference between devices. Not sure what you mean about Dropbox though, since the remote wipe from iCloud should delete Dropbox files from the old Mac too. If you have chosen to erase everything on your Dropbox account then that is a cloud thing for all devices. <comment291578> Dropbox has a button to remove devices by their pairing name and delete all data on that remote computer. I've already activate that, but it hasn't show that my stolen laptop has come online and been erased. I have a feeling it will see my new laptop as that pairing when I restore it. My Dropbox data is still on my Desktop. <comment291581> You can ask dropbox support about that, but I expect it can tell the difference between the two computers.
