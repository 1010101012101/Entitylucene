Turn off encryption on filevault2 second HDD <body> I have an Early 2011 MBP on which I installed an SSD (in the SuperDrive's bay). After that I enabled FileVault2 encryption on both the SSD (which has the ML 1.8.2 install) and on the original HDD that's currently mounted at boot-time on /Users (so all the storage for the users go on it and it's still encrypted no matter what).  I would like to add a second (and maybe a third?) partition to the HDD so that I can experiment with Windows 8 (and maybe the latest Ubuntu?) but the error I receive is    strongError: -69741: The target disk isn't eligible for reversion because it wasn't created by conversion or it is not part of a simple setup of exactly one logical and one physical volume/strong  Is there anything to do ?  <answer76949> What methods have you used when trying to disabling the encryption on your encrypted non-boot drive?

I ended up making a TimeMachine backup and just wiping the drive... :( <comment154852> This works exactly the same way.
