'Cannot connect to App Store' on mobile network <body> When I try accessing the App Store when I'm not connected to a wireless network, it shows 'Cannot connect to App Store'; I've already re-applied the settings for mobile data, but that didn't help. The weird thing is that it seems to be downloading update info (this morning I downloaded all the updates via wifi, and right now it shows me two new ones although I haven't been connected to wifi for a few hours).  Any ideas on how to fix this?  [iPhone 5s, iOS 9.2 beta]  <answer214260> h3Try logout and login into codeiTunes &amp; App Store/code on you phone./h3  <comment258667> I've already tried that, and just did it again, sadly it still isn't working. <comment258668> hmm, as it is beta you'll probably have to apply the current updates on wifi. <comment258677> Well, I think I'm actually able to do updates when I'm not connected to wifi, but the tabs line Highlights/Charts say 'Cannot connect to App Store' <comment258678> hmm, any reason for not trying updating using iTunes on Mac?
