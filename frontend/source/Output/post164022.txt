Text editor quotation mark woes <body> In text editor my quotation marks keep getting replaced by non ascii versions.  So if I am editing an XML document the double vertical line type quotation mark keeps getting auto-replaced by the curly type that breaks the XML document.  I have turned off the Text replacement option in preferences but it keeps happening.  <answer164028> If you are using TextEdit, go to Preferences  New Document  Options and uncheck the box for smart quotes:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/n010y.png" alt="TextEdit preferences"  You may then require a system restart.  <comment192197> Is the text editor you are using `TextEdit` or another one? Please add this key information within your original question (and not within comments which fate is to disappear).
