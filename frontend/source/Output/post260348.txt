How to remove adware on macOS Sierra 10.12.1? <body> I recently came across an adware on my Mac. I've uploaded a video on youtube. Pay attention to the very redirects! I used to have this on El Capitan as well, then I clean-installed Sierra. After about a month this is what I get: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBcPDWpB3XA&amp;feature=youtu.be  I've tried updating to the latest version of the OS which is 10.12.1 right now. I've tried Malware Bytes, MacScan and similar software; but they don't find anything.  I've tried resetting safari, used App Cleaner to delete all the related files. Also, no fix. I've tried changing my DNS servers and still no fix. There's no plugin or extension on my safari.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/v3mH6.png" alt="enter image description here"  So, how can I get rid of this adware?  <answer264038> Backup your data and let Malwarebytes do the job.  <comment325935> What is your question?  Please see [ask] for tips on asking good questions. <comment325937> @fsb I fixed it by adding a "How to remove..." to the title of the question. Thanks. <comment331182> it's not possible. I contacted MalwareBytes support and they said they don't provide malware removal for web browsers. <comment371704> I have the exact same problem as well. I run a macOS Sierra 10.12.6. <comment371802> @Zlatko for me it got fixed automatically after updates. I suggest a clean install and always update to the latest version as soon as they become available. Haven't had a problem since.
