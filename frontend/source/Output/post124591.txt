OSX is repeatedly asking for login keychain password <body> After starting up my newer iMac it's asking for for the login keychain password for several applications. It is stuck in a cycle that I can't cancel out of. Any suggestions?  <answer124592> You have 2 Options:  One is to just open the keychain at log in and leave it open - this is not recommended  2- open keychain find the application(s) in question and give them access  see example  you have to select the Allow all applications to access this item  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XqYGi.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer124630> It sounds as an issue either with the strongKeychain App/strong. Try repairing it. To do so just:  ol liLocate the strongKeychain Access/strong application, under strong/Applications/Utilities/strong./li liChoose strongKeychain Access  Keychain First Aid/strong./li liEnter your User name and Password./li liSelect emVerify/em and click emStart/em. /li liIf any problems were found, select emRepair/em and click emStart/em again./li /ol  It could be, too, that you've changed your account password without using the strongAccounts Preferences/strong pane. If that is the case, for your default keychain to be unlocked automatically when logged in, you'll have to Synchronize your Keychain Access and login passwords. To do so just:  ol liOpen strongKeychain Access/strong. /li liFrom the Edit menu, choose strongChange Password for Keychain "login."/strong/li liType the strongformer/strong password of the account that you are currently logged in to, then click emOK/em. /li liIf you entered the correct password, a new window appears; enter the original password again in the emCurrent Password field/em. /li liIn the emNew Password/em field, type the password that strongmatches/strong your current account password./li liRe-enter the newer password in the emVerify/em field, then click emOK/em./li /ol  This is needed because, as Apple explains it:     If you change your account's password using your Mac OS X Install disc (or if your network-based account password is changed due to a network admin forcing a password change), your default keychain password (which uses the same initial password as your user account) does not change. Because of this, you will be prompted to enter a keychain password each time an application requires authentication that your keychain would normally provide.   <answer201215> There is a bug that is affecting some users which is related to this. You may see the colour wheel of death when you get the certificate trust prompt from some applications, like Microsoft Remove Desktop of Microsoft Office (weird but it happened only with these to me!)  Once you see the colour wheel, your only change is to reboot and after this you will get several prompts for keychain password BUT you would have to type your old password even if you previously reconfigured Keychain Access to use the same password.  I will give lots of beers to the one that solves this issue, it drives me crazy!  <answer231888> I came across this same issue on El Capitan, and had already searched and tried all suggestions on here.  My solution was to strongdisable FileVault/strong under codeSystem Settings &gt; Security &amp; Privacy/code and everything works fine again.  strongUpdate/strong:   Before you downvote because you can't understand how someone can disable the default FileVault encryption: I don't see the downside of disabling FileVault. For really sensitive data, other tools such as Symantec Drive Encryption / PGP or TrueCrypt can be used. At least it doesn't get in the way like FileVault does with the system keychain.  As mentioned in the comments, I had searched on SO for this questions and found several answers, of which none worked for me. Therefore disabling FileVault (and switching to another, independent encryption tool for the data you want or need encrypted) is a viable option.  "Advantages vs disadvantages with using file vault":  https://discussions.apple.com/thread/1550363?tstart=0  <answer262398> I had the same problem. It has bothered me for several weeks on my new Mac. It should be caused by changing Mac password using 3rd party software. On macOS El Capitan and  Sierra, there is no codeKeychain Access &gt; Keychain First Aid/code. Changing login keychain's password does not help. To solve this problem, you have to reset your default keychain.  ol liOpen Keychain Access, which is in the Utilities folder of your Applications folder. /li liChoose Preferences from the Keychain Access menu, then click the Reset My Default Keychain button in the preferences window. After you enter your new password, Keychain Access creates an empty login keychain with no password. Click OK to confirm. (If you don't see a Reset My Default keychain button, close the preferences window and select the “login” keychain from the left side of the Keychain Access window. Press the Delete key, then click Delete References.)/li liChoose Log Out from the Apple menu to return to the login screen./li liLog in to your account using your new password. Your account password and login keychain password now match again./li /ol  <answer282621> Another possible cause of the problem might be the setting "Lock after x minutes of inactivity". Try checking it and if you can live with it, disable the timeout. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/w5gFB.png" alt="Keychain Settings"  <comment145749> what are the applictions <comment145790> Even more, what OSX version are you on? <comment219303> Related: [How to stop Google Chrome’s annoying keychain access request messages](http://www.idownloadblog.com/2013/03/04/google-chrome-wants-to-use-your-confidential-information-store-in-the-keychain/) <comment225111> When changing the password for the login keychain, I had to enter my old password in the initial dialog, then my new password in the _Current Password_ field. <comment259927> Make sure you are not accessing via screen share or remotely, since El Capitain you cannot modify the keychain via a software interface and will need to attach a keyboard and mouse to the offending machine. <comment282519> Where to find this option "Keychain First Aid" in order to run a repair? I don't find it in the Keychain Access app. I'm on El Capitan, Keychain Access Version 9.0 (55171.20.2) - seems to be of 2014. Is above description still valid? <comment282522> I tried above - the second option. When I want to save the changes after selecting "Allow all...", I am getting asked for the keychain password, and even there, after typing the correct password, the dialog won't go away and keep asking me for the password over and over. The password is definitely correct though. <comment282523> @MathiasConradt It is. You can always use its shortcut which is `Option+Command+A`, but the option is there, under the first menu field after the . <comment282524> @Thecafremo Sorry, maybe I'm blind, but I don't see it, this is my menu: http://snag.gy/nwMon.jpg Mentioned keyboard shortcut isn't doing anything. <comment282525> @MathiasConradt Hum, apparently it was removed with OS X's *10.11.2* update, as described [here](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/219926/where-has-keychain-first-aid-gone). Which reminds me that I've got some updates to perform. <comment282526> @Thecafremo Ok, thanks anyway. I posted a new topic including a screencast, cause none of any suggestions works for me. http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/231340/os-x-is-repeatedly-asking-for-login-keychain-password <comment282527> I've just described it in a separate post: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/231340/os-x-is-repeatedly-asking-for-login-keychain-password <comment283280> Related: http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/177836/9058 <comment283281> While this may have solved the problem, the solution has some obvious drawbacks... <comment283282> @patrix Maybe some drawbacks, but on the other hands, what's a mechanism worth that does not work properly or breaks other parts. You could still use PGP Whole Disk encryption (Symantec Drive Encryption) and achieve the same. <comment283317> There seem to be less destructive ways to fix this keychain issue. <comment283323> @patrix Which ones? I tried quite a few that I found here on SX. See http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/231340/os-x-is-repeatedly-asking-for-login-keychain-password <comment283349> Well, there are other answers here. If they didn't work for you and you are happy with the solution described in your answer, fine. I for my part wouldn't be. <comment319757> Liked the "Microsoft Remove Desktop" branding ;P <comment331965> The Apple assbandits removed First Aid, I've had this problem on every macbook ever in every company I've worked for when company policy have prompted me to change passwords. So annoying that the Apple idiots didn't fix such a fundamental problem. I have to enter every password I've ever used multiple times until the dialogs go away :@ <comment338291> I don't see the downside of disabling FileVault. For really sensitive data, other tools such as Symantec Drive Encryption / PGP can be used. At least it doesn't get in the way like FileVault does with the system keychain. <comment338296> Disabling FV to fix Keychain issues and switching to other encryption tools seems to be like dumping your car after you run out of gas and use public transport instead :-) <comment338299> Ok, understood, although I don't see it this way. It's like Windows users using Thunderbird and Firefox or Chrome instead of Internet Explorer and Outlook, totally understandable :). Just because FileVault comes with OS X, it is not necessarily the best solution, even though it comes integrated :) <comment338300> Well, the integration goes a long way in making this seamless, especially for technically not so experienced users. At least as long as Keychain doesn't interfere :-)
