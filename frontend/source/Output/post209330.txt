How to make a bootable USB drive from Install OS X El Capitan.app? <body> I wish to upgrade from Snow Leopard (10.6.8) to anything higher.  Disk Utilities repair says the disk needs to be repaired.  So, I need to boot onto something other than the boot drive to run disk utilities.  I downloaded El Capitan from the App Store.  It appears to be an install app.  I tried diskmakerx, but it requires 10.7 or higher.  Not sure how to make a bootable image from the install app in Applications.  I can't use OS X Recovery, that also requires 10.7 or higher.  These directions require the DVD media, which my parents likely never had.  All the directions I've found for bootable USBs require a disk image.  Any options?  strongEdit 1/strong: I created a USB drive using these directions, "Option 2: Use Disk Utility."  I modified a bit (El Capitan instead of Yosemite, got the BaseImage.dmg by copying and using xattr to remove the invisible bit, ..), but I have a USB key with "Mac OS Extended" format and 7.8G of stuff on it.  When I boot up holding down the option key, it doesn't show any menu to choose where to boot from, it just ignores my USB drive.  When I open the "Startup Disk" system preferences dialog, it does not show the USB drive (even though it is mounted).  It is plugged directly into this mac mini, not through a hub or keyboard.  I looked around for related questions (e.g., here), and found nothing relevant.  Any idea of how to debug a USB drive being ignored upon (Snow Leopard) startup?  <answer209334> (From OS X Daily)  You'll need an 8 GB or larger USB Drive. Remember, it will be erased, so backup any important files.  Use the following command in strongTerminal/strong (assuming the strongInstall OS X El Capitan/strong app is in code/Applications/code, which where the App Store installs it by default)  Also make note of the USB Volume Label and use its name in the command below in place of: code&lt;USB_Volume_Name&gt;/code  precodesudo /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ El\ Capitan.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume "/Volumes/&lt;USB_Volume_Name&gt;" --applicationpath /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ El\ Capitan.app --nointeraction /code/pre  <comment252707> Thanks for the ref. As described in the article, that produces an error "Failed to start erase of disk due to error (-9999,0)." before 10.9. I am trying the "Disk Utility" method in the article. <comment273944> @IronCraftMan your answer is valid *only* for OS X 10.7+. It doesn't work on OS X 10.6. On Snow Leopard, the only way to create a bootable USB key of newer version of the OS X installer is by using Disk Utility.
