Caps, tab and fn not working in bootcamp <body> I am using bootcamp regularly with Windows 10. Everything was working fine but now caps, tab and fn is not working, whereas left shift is working fine and also tilde. I have tried  ol liSMC reset/li liCreated new account for windows/li /ol  But nothing seems to work. I see this seems to be running issue searching on web, however I find no proper solution. And its really frustrating.  Station: strongMacbook Book Air, mid 2013. El Capitan/strong  Any help would be appreciated  <comment351210> Have you tried using an external keyboard to see if the problem exists there too? <comment351212> @Allan I don't have it at this moment <comment351214> It would be a good test.  Also, you should indicate what Mac model and what version of macOS you are running. <comment351217> @Allan definitely, updated my question, however I have not used OSX for sometime <comment351218> Since you're not using macOS, it might be a good idea to run [Apple Hardware Test (AHT)](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201257) to see if it's a keyboard failure.  Hold the D key while booting from a powered off state with the AC adapter connected.
