iPhone alarm through headphones only? <body> By default the iPhone alarm sounds both through the headphones and speakers (understandably), is there a setting somewhere to set the alarm to only go through the headphones?  (The use case is I want to wake up with the alarm but not wake everyone else in the house)  <answer44758> No, unfortunately there is no such setting. Your best bet is probably to use a 3rd party app with alarm clock functionality. That way it will only play the sound through the headphones and not the speakers. The main disadvantage is that you would need to remember to keep the app launched before you go to bed each time.  <answer122727> Use the built in clock app for your alarm and it will bypass the cable and come out the speaker.  All third party alarm apps fail at this...  <answer136037> You could mute the voice before inserting the earphones and then put in the earphones and set the volume. This way the alarm sound will only come through the earphones because you have muted your phone, not the earphones.   <answer170900> I recorded a silent alarm and then used that as the sound and set the alarm to vibrate.  This way, the vibration wakes me up but not everyone else.  The vibration works really well if you put the phone next to or under your pillow.  The phone can get warm if it is under the pillow though so I usually put it just to the side.  <comment143253> The question is the other way around - looking for sound only via the cable and no sound from the speaker. <comment164594> This actually works great, no 3rd party app needed. Just lower the volume before plugging in headphones, and you only hear the alarm in your headphones, not out loud. This should be the correct answer imho :) <comment339371> iOS 10 seems to bump the phone volume up as soon as I plug in earbuds. Perhaps this doesn't work anymore.
