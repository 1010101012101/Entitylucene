Trouble with emojis in Excel spreadsheet <body> I'm coding sentiment on social media, but can't see 'emojis' in my Excel spreadsheet. I have a 2015 MacBook with OS X 10.11.6. Before, with a 2012 MacBook Air, I never had any problems 'displaying emojis.  <comment315222> What version of Excel are you using? Any more information you can provide and perhaps even an example would be helpful in finding a solution.
