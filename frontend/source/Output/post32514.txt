Mac OS X Wireless Keyboard Power Button <body> I have done everything to trouble shoot my non-working keyboard. I've been using it a year and it is set up correctly There is supposed to be a power button? I sure can't find it!  Thanx!  <answer32515> The power button is on the right hand side, it's part of the "tube" at the back and clearly marked with a power button symbol.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vD3S9.png" alt="enter image description here"  Did you check the batteries as well?  <answer32516> Many people have experienced this problem. Often this was related to strongbad contacts/strong inside the keyboard. This is a fix proposed by several people:  h2Fix/h2     I resolved this by rolling some strongsoft household metal sponge/strong [...] into a small ball and dropping it   directly on the contact, then jamming in the batteries. Don't worry,   the case will close (my ball was about 75mm in diameter). [...] It is nevertheless important that the metal sponge strongdoesn't   touch the casing/strong, this could cause a shortcircuit.    source: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/1797139?start=0&amp;tstart=0  <comment37212> I don't mind the downvote, but just out of curiosity: why? <comment37214> Switched wifi to bluetooth - better match with keyboard tech that's used by the wireless keyboard. <comment37216> +1 for picture and suggestion to check the batteries. <comment37217> Checking the power button and replacing the batteries is what every person does first when such problems occur (IMHO). @Pam has been using this keyboard for a year! I'm sure he's smarter than that. <comment37218> @Pam explicitly asked for the power button though... Oh well, never mind. <comment37220> Did not read that part... That's weird! I'd undo my downvote if I could. Maybe, I should also take back the "he's/she's smarter than that". Lol <comment37221> Hey, thank you! I'm in business. Ha. I thought I may have turned it off by mistake but could not find it anywhere. That's how long since I turned it off. Should have been doing that anyway. :) <comment37222> Hey, thank you!
