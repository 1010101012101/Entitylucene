Use third party bluetooth keyboard or virtual keyboard to login to MacOS <body> Hi I started to use a third party keyboard with my MacOS. As I remember in the past bluetooth keyboards from third party are not activated on the login screen. I tried this one and it is also not working. The trackpad on the keyboard is not working either. I do have an original Apple bluetooth trackpad that is activated so I am looking for a solution to use my third party keyboard or a virtual keyboard with my Apple trackpad to type in the password.  <comment302807> I think it's a security feature that prevents it (non-Apple-certified devices may be able to intercept whatever you type, for example) <comment302809> What make/model of keyboard are you talking about exactly? <comment302825> Don't countless people use 3rd party bluetooth keyboards to log into Mac Mini's without problem?  I don't remember anything about them normally not working for this. <comment303168> @TomGewecke it is a no name brand so i guess it is not certified. <comment304140> I can't find any references to others with your problem.  Do you have some?
