Where are the popcorn time temporary files stored on OS X Mavericks? <body> I want to find the location of temporary files created by popcorn time so that I can stream via the chromecast player to my TV. I can find that on Windows but don't know where  is it located on Mac.  <answer132165> Start a Terminal and use   precodefind / -name filename.abc /code/pre  codefind/code is a unix command with a large set of options but basically it is codefind [path...] [expression]/code. If you search the whole filesystem code//code you will get permission errors, use   precodesudo find / -name filename.abc /code/pre  to avoid this. Here is its manpage.  <answer132301> I found the answer here.  Open Terminal.app and enter the following command:   precodeopen $TMPDIR/Popcorn-Time /code/pre  This will open the Popcorn-Time storage directory, and from there you can copy the file away to where you want it.  Edit:  Now  precodeopen $TMPDIR/Butter /code/pre  Edit:  Changed again,  precodeopen $TMPDIR/Popcorn\ Time /code/pre  <answer148826> Looks like in the latest version installed today (10/8/14, not sure how to tell version from app) there is a "PopcornTime" folder in your "Downloads" folder.  <answer164918> In the Popcorn Time program, click the settings Cog in the top right corner to open the settings page. At the top of the SETTINGS page, checkmark SHOW ADVANCED SETTINGS.  Scroll down to CACHE DIRECTORY settings. The default setting is to clear the cache folder when you close the program.  Uncheck this option so that the movies you watch will stay in the temporary folder. You can click the folder icon next to the cache filename path to open the Temporary PopcornTime folder in Finder.  <answer238691> Folder name changed, use:  open $TMPDIR/Butter  <comment155302> Did you check ~/Library already? <comment155307> @Rob ~/Library contains hundreds of files and foldersâ€”can you be any more specific? <comment167252> this is not the anser to the question, this is a gnu util explained but does not tell the OP where to look. <comment292784> That should be an edit to http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/132301/237 quoting documentation of the change <comment293441> The new syntax is `open $TMPDIR/Butter` <comment293442> Not sure why people are downvoting you.  Until the old answer has an edit that's accepted this is the new correct answer. <comment331213> currently it is open $TMPDIR/Popcorn-Time-CE-cache/
