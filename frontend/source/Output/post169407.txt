Can not access secure link from within a secure website <body> Have iMac, OS10.7.5, Safari 6.1.6  This is an intermittent problem.  When paying bills online, I first access the secure website of my bank.  When I click on the Bill Payment tab, normally the screen clears and there is a transfer to a secure site (URL is hidden) of a service the bank subscribes to that actually conducts a bill pay transaction.  The service is run by Fidelity.  Occasionally, after the screen clears the system hangs with a blank screen.  I can still access other web pages for the bank.  Neither bank nor Fidelity have a clue.  I have enabled all cookies and reset the browser, but that doesn't help.  Proxies are not enabled.  I am using a Linksys wireless router that does have a firewall, but otherwise there are no unusual security settings. The MAC firewall is not enabled.  <comment198975> Have you tried another browser like Firefox or Chrome? I routinely have problems with certain sites in Safari (like you, v6.1.6) that will work fine with other browsers.
