Syncing iCal with Outlook2011 <body> No matter what I do, I can't get new items that I add to Outlook 2011 calendar to actually show up in iCal. Is this a bug? Does anyone have a fix for this?  <answer52596> To set up iCal calendars, open iCal  select strongiCal/strong menu  strongPreferences/strong  strongAccounts/strong  strong"+"/strong below account list, then add your email account used in MS Outlook. As long as it is a IMAP email account, this should enable the calendar in iCal. It also should sync automatically.  <comment60135> How are you syncing it? Is it an iCloud, MS Exchange calendar, Gmail, or something? <comment60142> Is is an Outlook 2011 Calendar and I'm actually not quite sure "how". I just want to make it so that when I add an event to my Outlook 2011 Calendar, it automatically syncs with iCal on my Mac...
