Screenshots not appearing on desktop <body> When I take a screenshot with my Mac, the screenshots are not appearing on my desktop. Could the screenshot destination location have been changed on Mac? Is this a common problem?  <answer230231> To reset the default location of screenshots to your Desktop, type this in Terminal:  codedefaults write com.apple.screencapture location ~/Desktop/code  then restart.  <comment280965> see http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/222662/85275 though if you haven't changed it, try rebooting & see if they appear.
