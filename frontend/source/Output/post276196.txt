Why would AppleIDAuthAgent take nearly 100% CPU? <body> The AppleIDAuthAgent process on my 2007 Mac Pro running OS X 10.7.5 is taking up 95-100 % CPU continuously.   I use it whenever I go to work.   I also use it as a server. I occasionally pull/push using codegit/code and to access it via SSH and remote desktop from home or elsewhere. It's behind a major university firewall and has fairly high security settings.  More info:  ul liParent Process is codelaunchd/code./li liThe process has no recent hangs. /li liReal Memory Size: 122.3 MB/li liVirtual Memory Size: 18.49 GB  &lt;-- Suspicious..../li liShared Memory Size: 4.2 MB/li liPrivate Memory Size: 66.0 MB/li liVirtual Private Memory: 291.1 MB/li liCPU time: 573 hrs/li /ul  I can provide other info if requested.   <comment347579> Try sampling the process to see what it's doing.  You can do it from Activity Monitor (sorry, I'm not sure about the exact command for 10.7.5). <comment347580> Also, have you tried restarting the machine? <comment347708> I did restart the machine. Things went down (CPU around 10-20%), but were very, very slowly increasing. <comment348008> Then it's very likely that it's simply a software bug within AppleIDAuthAgent process, triggered by something in your Mac's configuration.   If you can get in, I strongly recommend filing a report at [bugreport.apple.com](bugreport.apple.com). <comment354439> I simply killed that bugger and things went on normally. <comment355185> @Bob: Apple no longer will let my computer update because my hardware is too old. Is it worth submitting a bug report even so?
