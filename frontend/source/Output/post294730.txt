Is this dust inside Retina Display on my Macbook Pro 13 inch? <body> I have a late 2015 13 Inch Macbook Pro with Retina Display, and here are the pics of that. Could anyone please suggest how do I get these spots of my screen?

Here is another image of that..   http://imgur.com/a/lk99M <comment372008> Was it like this when you bought it? - If not, did it occur gradually or all at once? <comment372010> No. This started appearing after 1.5 years after I bought it.. It was spotless before. I tried to clean it, but it appears its inside the screen. <comment372011> Very odd. I don't think it looks like dust at all. It could look a bit like the problem some people were having that the anti-reflective coating starts to peel of after a while. Apple started a quality program for this and extended warranties up to 3 years from date of original purchase as far as I remember. Try contacting Apple to see if they would replace the screen under warranty! <comment372017> Thanks a lot. I have contacted support, and they confirmed its an issue with anti-reflective coating. I am getting it replaced. <comment372022> Super - good to know that the quality program is effective!
