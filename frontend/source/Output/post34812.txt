How can I view Image Dimensions in Finder List View? <body> How do I view image dimensions in List View in Finder? I found this but I don't find this option on my machine. I'm running Snow Leopard; is this a Lion only feature?  <answer34814> I'm not sure about 10.6, but on 10.7 the dimensions are shown in information panels:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nJ7dh.png" alt=""  <answer34815> h3Lion only/h3  Any subdirectory of code~/Pictures/code can do this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dGzYp.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  strongNote:/strong (Thanks to @koiyu)  While the first nine options are available for any list view, the options below the first line differ according to the relative location in your folder.  Options in:code~/Pictures/../code Options in:code~/Music/../code  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sGfmK.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LdNUe.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment39720> [If I remember correctly](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/32043/1453) the extra columns available for list view are relative to the folder path. Is your `Mac Wallpaper` under `~/Pictures` by any chance? If not, I stand corrected. <comment39721> Interesting! Your assumption is correct. I did not notice this before because I sort my media according to the default folders in the home directory. <comment39728> Is this available only in Lion ? <comment39729> I think this is available in Snow Leopard aswell, but I cannot confirm this. Try it and report back! <comment39731> I definitely dont see dimensions listed anywhere for column view format. <comment39732> Ok, I'll add this info to my answer.
