Why can't I control environment variables via /etc/environment? <body> Google search reveals that "/etc/environment" can be used in OS X to set global environment variables (like JAVA_HOME etc, in key-value pairs). I have tried to add following string to this file on OS X Lion:  precodesudo sh -c 'echo "FOO=bar" &gt;&gt; /etc/environment' /code/pre  But after rebooting OS X, codeecho $FOO/code displays empty string.  Am I doing something wrong or is the information on the internet misleading and "/etc/environment" can't be used in OS X, and am I limited to "/etc/launchd.conf"?  <answer58763> code/etc/environment/code may work in Linux but doesn't in OS X. There exist other options to accomplish similar results though.  h2Additional paths/h2  Additional paths can be added in code/etc/paths.d/code by creating a text file there listing one path component per line (e.g. codesudo echo /usr/local/superbin &gt; /etc/paths.d/superbin/code).  h2Other environment variables/h2  As more or less everything is controlled by codelaunchd/code these days global environment variables can be specified directly in code/etc/launchd.conf/code as described in this StackOverflow answer.  <answer64702> Another solution for feeding codelaunchd/code, and a discussion of the approaches in the StackOverflow answer mentioned, is provided at superuser by yours truly.  <answer153138> You emcan/em use code/etc/environment/code on OSX Yosemite, embut/em you need to set up the daemons slurping the file into the environment at start up yourself.  See this stackoverflow answer for helpful and rather extensive details.   Warning: In order to go with the answer above, your code/etc/environment/code needs to look different to yours. Be aware of this.  <comment67294> Where does it say /etc/environment can be used? <comment67311> @Mark UNIX has different notion for global environment variables? Is it documented somewhere? <comment67453> I meant all the /etc/environment comments are by Linux people my IOSX does not have /etc/environment and you should not alter Apple supplied files in /etc <comment67668> @EyeofHell, would you mind rephrasing the question to "How can I set environment variables globally'? <comment76112> Answers on Ask Different need to be more than just a link. It's okay to include a link, but please summarize or excerpt it in the answer. The idea is to make the answer stand alone. <comment76212> @DanielLawson I am not sure if the part of the answer above that links to stackoverflow by patrix is more self sufficient then my bit. What do you suggest that I should add? <comment76213> It isn't, but the rest of his answer contains stand-alone answers. What should you include? Some of the great content you posted on SO. <comment166418> Answer from Patrix on the same point contains: server + conf. file. It is a good approach of a self sufficient answer without crossing the frontier of plagiarism :). <comment177798> For people on Yosemite: Please note that `/etc/launchd.conf` is no longer processed.  There is therefore no remaining way to set environment variables automatically at startup for Dock/Spotlight-launched applications (really).
