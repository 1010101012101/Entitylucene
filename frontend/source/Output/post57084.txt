Can corrupted MacBook1,1 graphics be fixed? <body> Can the graphics on this 2008 MacBook1,1 be fixed? I believe the OS version is Leopard with all Leopard updates installed. Everything looks fine through entering your password at the login screen, then the wallpaper appears, and the mouse, but all the graphics are corrupted after that, like so: img src="https://i.imgur.com/VUK0G.jpg?1" alt="good graphics before login" img src="https://i.imgur.com/TunCj.jpg?1" alt="bad graphics after login" It is very hot here right now, could this be overheating damage? I tried resetting PRAM/NVRAM, next I will try some kind of restore with the Leopard DVD...  <answer57093> I would try erasing the Mac and reinstalling the OS  <comment72932> This seems quite extreme for a first step. <comment72933> Have you tried logging in while holding down the shift key to prevent launch-on-login apps from running? If that doesn't work, try rebooting while holding down shift to prevent launch-on-boot apps from running.
