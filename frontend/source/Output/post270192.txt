Making a Linked Folder Hierarchy with a subset of content <body> I'd like to create a folder hierarchy that is a duplicate of another folder hierarchy except that it excludes all folders or files with a particular label. Any recommendations on how to create or maintain such a thing?  Specifically, I have a bunch of large 4K video downloads from a RED camera, so they are a series of nested folders with various metadata files, and R3D files that run up to 4.04 GB each at the leaf level.   I want a second hierarchy with the same content except that if any files or folders have a red finder label, it won't be included. If a folder is red, that means none of the content of the folder should be in the mirror, no matter what the label. The new folder will be all the sharable content; I want to be able to drag that folder to an external drive to copy everything that has been released.  We've been keeping the Published folder as a copy of the original, but keep running out of drive space, since nearly the whole collection is being duplicated. To save the space, we'd prefer to use links, probably hard links to make dumping to external easy.   It would be possible, but not trivial, to write a script or app. Any easier ways? Maybe some backup tool?  <comment339512> I'd say because of how the info is stored for whether or not a file/folder has a label and what color it is and that along with the exclusions you want, you'll need to write a script (or two) to handle all that you're asking. Basically you would write a script to build an exclude list that can be used in a `rsync` command later in the script or with another script depending on how your decide to write it.
