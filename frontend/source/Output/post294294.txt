How to set up windows so its possible to boot non Apple laptops from it? <body> I have an old Macbook and a new Windows laptop. I want to install Windows 7 on the Mac's Samsung 850 EVO SSD so that its possible to use it on both Macbook and the Windows laptop.  ol liIs such a thing possible?/li liIf yes, how does one do that?/li /ol  Here's why I need to do this. (feel free to skip this)  The (2008) Macbook is my personal laptop but Windows one is for work. I want to avoid using work laptop if possible. I'm taking classes for professional exams and my LMS software is compatible with only windows. The institute is basically being a **** and is saying if my mac's logic board gives out (which I think it might), I need to pay about $200 extra since its not possible to generate a new key or something like that.  So I need to be able to just plug in the samsung SSD in a windows laptop so that its ready to use. I have exams in 3 months.  <answer294296> Apart from the fact that you'd have to ring Microsoft to reinstate your licence every time you swapped, Windows is not very good at swapping hardware.   A Mac drive can be used to boot any Mac older than the OS on the drive; Windows doesn't work that way, you'd need a bare-metal clone &amp; install the correct drivers every time.  <comment371464> So set up a Virtual Machine and keep the files in the cloud. <comment371478> Assuming that I install windows through bootcamp.  will buying a macbook (older than the OS) and updating the drivers for windows enable me to use the new laptop exactly like the old one? <comment371502> Installing Windows on BC isn't the issue - attempting to move the install from machine to machine is what will fail. That one of them is a Mac is almost irrelevant, you can't even do it between 2 PCs unless they are identical. Even if 'identical' they will have different part serial numbers, forcing you to ring Microsoft every time you swap machine.
