Reset Apple ID completely <body> Is it possible to reset the entire data present in your Apple ID. From all the download apps to all the iCloud data and Game Center data too. If yes, how?  <answer217561> One way I know is changing your e-mailaddress to another one and then sign up with your previous e-mailaddress. It will be a clean account at that time.  <comment262967> Thanks, let me try. Also, can you transfer game center's data to another apple id? If yes, how? <comment262970> You cannot transfer data or purchases from one ID to another, no, but that's really a separate question. <comment262987> @MixCoded Definitely have a look at [ask] before asking a second question. Each program stores data differently, so you would want to be pretty narrow about why you can't reset that game's state and/or what the goal is for the swap. <comment263033> @MixCoded to transfer purchases, link the two together with family sharing. Note: you'll need the same credit card on both accounts. <comment263099> @bmike Give him some credit, he's new (according to the reputation). ;) <comment263158> @Rob Yes - also keep in mind, you don't see the deleted posts by a user. There may or may not be a pattern when moderators ask someone to read the guide or some specific actions that aren't out in the open. ;-) I 100% support being kind and giving lots of credit - we all start somewhere with no clothes, no reputation and no context. <comment263161> @bmike up there you go
