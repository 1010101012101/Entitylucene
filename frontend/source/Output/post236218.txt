wget gives error "dyld: Library not loaded: /opt/local/lib/libnettle.4.dylib" <body> When I try to use codewget/code, I am getting this error message:  precode$: wget dyld: Library not loaded: /opt/local/lib/libnettle.4.dylib   Referenced from: /opt/local/bin/wget   Reason: image not found Trace/BPT trap: 5 /code/pre  I have reinstalled codewget/code using homebrew (codebrew reinstall wget/code), I updated and upgraded my homebrew, however this hasn't helped.  In my code/opt/local/lib//code folder I cannot find codelibnettle.4.dylib/code, however I do find code/opt/local/lib/libnettle.6.dylib/code. I tried to solve the problem by simply symlinking from code/opt/local/lib/libnettle.6.dylib/code to code/opt/local/lib/libnettle.4.dylib/code. This didn't help either, but got me a new error message:  precode$ wget dyld: Library not loaded: /opt/local/lib/libhogweed.2.dylib   Referenced from: /opt/local/lib/libgnutls.28.dylib   Reason: image not found Trace/BPT trap: 5 /code/pre  When I run codebrew info wget/code, I get this output:  precodewget: stable 1.17.1 (bottled), HEAD Internet file retriever https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/ /usr/local/Cellar/wget/1.17.1 (9 files, 1.6M) *   Built from source with: --with-debug From: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/wget.rb ==&gt; Dependencies Build: xz ✔, pkg-config ✔ Recommended: openssl ✔ Optional: libressl ✔, pcre ✔, libmetalink ✔, gpgme ✔ ==&gt; Options ... /code/pre  How can I fix this?  <answer236227> You could try updating the DYLD cache:  precodesudo update_dyld_shared_cache -root / -force /code/pre  It is possible that the Dynamic Link Library cache hasn't updated to include the shared libraries which were installed when you installed wget.  <answer236231> I think you have both MacPorts and Homebrew installed. MacPorts installs by default in em/strongopt/strong/local/em, whereas Homebrew installs in em/strongusr/strong/local/em. Since the command you are actually running is em/opt/local/bin/wget/em, you probably have em/opt/local/bin/em before em/usr/local/bin/em in your PATH environment. Check it with:  code$ echo $PATH/code  In such a case, any software installed with Homebrew is not used at all, if not called with its absolute path. So, try launching Homebrew's emwget/em with its absolute path:  code$ /usr/local/bin/wget/code   If it is working in this way, put em/usr/local/bin/em as first folder in your PATH environment, by modifying em~/.profile/em or em~/.bash_profile/em file.  <comment289212> Thanks a lot, this solved it! Indeed, I had macports installed and it had put /opt/local/bin in the `$PATH`, before '/urs/local/bin'. <comment289213> Thank you for your suggestion. I tried to run this command, however I got the error message `update_dyld_shared_cache[37979] Error: Unable to unlink //var/db/spindump/OLDDSC-1EADBFCB-4F78-34F0-A9C8-F819511098EA: 1 Operation not permitted`. However, the solution by gpz500 worked.
