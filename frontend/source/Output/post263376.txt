Is there a quad-core configuration of the 13'' MacBook Pro 2016? <body> Is there a quad-core configuration of the 13 in MacBook Pro 2016 model? There is a quad core option for 15 inch, but I can't find one for 13 inch.  <answer263385> Nope, according to Apple's website. 13" model doesn't have quad-core model(don't know why, always wanted that option), not even build to order ones. It is 15" exclusive.  <answer263389> In the sense of a real quad core, no.   However, it is worth noting that all possible CPU configurations do support strongTurbo Boost 2.0/strong and strongHyper Threading/strong. Hyper-threading will be of more interest to you.  Here is a brief summary of both:  ul listrongTurbo Boost 2.0/strong automatically increases the speed of the active cores to improve performance when needed. Depending on the actual configuration, this boost will range from a boost of 3.3GHz up to 3.6GHz). You can read more about this here. You can also disable and enable Turbo Boost at will./li listrongHyper Threading/strong allows the system to recognize four total emcores/em (two real and two virtual).
