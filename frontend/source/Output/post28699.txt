Can't turn on FileVault after restore from Time Machine <body> I have bought myself a SSD and replaced the internal disk with it.  I was running Lion before (latest patch level).  I'm using Time Machine to back my laptop up.    When I was done replacing my HDD I booted up a Lion installation USB stick.br I created one partition on my SSD and told it to restore from my Time Machine backup.    This worked great, however I also want to again turn on FileVault and I'm getting the error:       FileVault can’t be turned on for the disk “Macintosh HD”.br   Some disk formats don’t support the recovery partition required by encryption.br   To use encryption, reinstall this version of Mac OS X on a reformatted disk.   I've read that this is because I'm now missing the recovery partition (Didn't even know I had that).  ul liWhat are my options here?  /li liCan I create this partition manually?  /li /ul  Do I need to reinstall Lion again (cleanly), patch it, and then restore from Time Machine?  <answer28737> From http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4790     strongFileVault 2 requirements/strong      FileVault 2 requires OS X Lion and Recovery HD installed on your startup drive, which the OS X Lion installer will attempt to create at installation. If you receive an alert that no Recovery HD could be created and continued to install OS X Lion, you will be unable to use FileVault 2. See this article for more information. Please note that Recovery HD must be present on your computer's startup volume to use FileVault 2 (not an external Recovery HD).   Also, if you partitioned the new SSD yourself, ensure that you used the GUID partition table scheme.  Re-installing lion over the top of your existing install will recreate it for you.  <answer61707> I has a similar problem. You don't need to reinstall your OS just to get the Recovery partition. Here's what I did to get it to work:  ol liFirst of all make a full backup (I personally use TimeMachine)./li liMake sure that you have a bootable Mountain Lion USB drive/li liFollow the instructions here: https://brain.osx.ca/groups/coolstuff/wiki/932a7/, but you can probably skip the parts about deleting and merging your current partitions (you probably just got the one partition). /li /ol  Although the above link shows you how to make the partition, thus allowing you to use FileVault, it doesn't make my Recovery Partition bootable. I'm okay with that, because I have a bootable USB drive.  <answer73632> I have described my solution in this blogpost: http://hints.binaryage.com/recover-lost-recovery-hd-for-filevault/  <answer102456> If you have any other disk around with Recovery Partition — use Carbon Copy Cloner. It allows you to clone Recovery Partition.  <comment85552> Whilst your answer may theoretically answer the question, [it would be preferable](http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/8259) to include the essential parts of the article in an answer below, and provide the link for reference <comment116763> Reinstalling the OS right over top of your current OS installation will auto-create a recovery partition (although it will be an internet recovery one). <comment117262> This worked perfectly for me. Note that you must merge the partitions, you cannot delete the new partition or it will also delete the new recovery partition
