Resolution of pictures hopping from iphoto to imovie to idvd <body> So, I've got this pretty big (12 minutes, 3sec/slide) slide show. I may be done with it. I may not.  The show is composed of ten iPhoto-11 slideshows. Each one was set up 4:3, then exported, with the kind advice of Nathan in another question to specify H.264, 2048 bit rate, and the second-highest resolution (my pick on the theory that I was not going to be driving an HDTV, just a relatively ordinary projector).  Imported into iMovie-11 at 30fps, arranged, decorated with music, exported to via the share menu iDVD. Didn't touch emanything/em in iDVD. just pushed the burn button.  Inserted resulting disk into nice new-ish dvd player with 30" LCD TV, 720 resolution. The pictures have a very visible structure of being built of little squares.  I dont' see artifacts in full-screen preview in iPhoto, or in full-screen imovie preview on my macbook pro. (On my mini, it warns me that full resolution will be degradated, so the presence of them there is not a surprise). But the DVD has this problem.  strongedit/strong  I discovered an option in iDVD to vary the 'encoding quality'. Moving that up to professional looked to me to make a notable improvement.  Ideas?  <comment8268> Is this a problem when you play the DVD on your computer? You can do this through the DVD Player app in your Applications folder. <comment8270> I didn't try that. See update in a sec. <comment34655> iMovie does compress movies.that may be why you are having problems with it. I have had the same problem with FCE movies and I had to use [Compressor](http://www.apple.com/finalcutpro/compressor/) to re-encode it. It made a definite difference. <comment248825> If you are looking for a professional feel and image quality for your videos, I would recommend a semi-pro editor such as Premiere Pro, and using Compressor or DVD Studio Pro.
