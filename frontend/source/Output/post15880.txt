os x terminal -remove files older than x days <body> trying to create a scripts that deletes files older than X days. It seemed straight forward enough but all files seem to be getting removed?  precodefind /Volumes/Groups/Projects/530_BFAMI/test/ -ctime +30 -print -exec rm {} \; /code/pre  any ideas welcome!?   Also would be good to print file information for matches as maybe my dates are misleading in finder?  <answer15884> To answer the question asked in your comment: You can join separate criteria just by listing them, one after the other. If you prefer, you can use code-a/code or code-and/code in between them, but these are redundant. You can also use code-o/code or code-or/code for the OR operator, and you can use parentheses â€“ which must be quoted to protect them from the shell, as in code\(/code and code\)/code for grouping.  For the full details, run: codeman find/code  <answer15893> It is considered dangerous to use -exec rm without first ls. You should probably check that first. Reverse check is also a good hint to tell you if your timing is correct.  precodefind . -maxdepth 1 -type f -mtime -30d -exec ls -latr {} \; /code/pre  OR  precodefind . -maxdepth 1 -type f -atime -30d -exec ls -latr {} \; /code/pre  ol liConstrain your find result. Make sure what you explicitly ask for./li liCompare to see if the opposite result is what actually has been excluded from your original command./li liProbably code-mtime/code or code-atime/code are more appropraite but again compare the result and see if they are actually what you need. /li /ol  <answer15894> Never suggesting code-exec rm .../code.  coderm/code is simply too dangerous command. Always dry-run first. IMHO it is better using this:  precodefind /Volumes/Groups/Projects/530_BFAMI/test/ -ctime +30 -print0 | xargs -0 -n1 /code/pre  this will show the dry-run and only when you satisfied you can add the coderm/code to the end  precodefind /Volumes/Groups/Projects/530_BFAMI/test/ -ctime +30 -print0 | xargs -0 rm /code/pre  If you start using this codepiped to xargs/code version, you can always add more filters, like:  precodefind /some/where -mtime +3d -print0 | grep -ziE '\.(jpg|png|gif)$' | xargs -0 rm /code/pre  and similar (more) powerful combinations.  <answer16039> Try this: codefind . -ctime +30 | xargs rm -r 2&gt; /dev/null/code  For some reason, this runs rm twice. So I just redirect the errors to the black hole code/dev/null/code  Enjoy.  <comment17270> agh apologies. Is working. Can i have multiple parameters? Ie include a size? -ctime +30 AND -size +10000000c <comment17272> There's a *significant* difference between `ctime` and `mtime` and in most cases people mean to use `mtime` (the time the contents of the file last changed) and not `ctime` (the time the inode-related information for the file changed). Very rare to see `ctime` used this way, so I mention this as a caution to you OP. <comment240366> This answer should have been accepted. Thanks, was looking for just this. <comment355869> What is -ctime +30 ? Is it 30 days before? or 30 minutes before files. Please explain. <comment355885> @ToughGuy  If no units are specified, this primary evaluates to true if the difference between the time of last              change of file status information and the time find was started, rounded up to the next full 24-hour              period, is n 24-hour periods. - aka: days
