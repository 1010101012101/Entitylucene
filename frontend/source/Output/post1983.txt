How do I change the calendar dot color on iPhone iOS 4? <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   How do I change a calendarâ€™s color in iOS 4.2.1?       It seems like it just assigns random color when you add a calendar.  Is there a way to change calendar color on iOS 4? I'd like to pick a color for each calendar...  <answer1984> It seems impossible directly on the iPhone/iPod. I have a MobileMe account, and I can change the calendar colours from within the MobileMe web interface. Maybe this is possible with other snychable calendars (Google, Outlook, iCal), too. But I have none of them to try it.  <answer1985> The only way I know how to do it is in iCal (providing you have a Mac). Ctrl+click on the Calendar along the left side of the screen  Get Info  Click the color selector on the right to change the color.

The color on Google Cal does not transfer over to iPhone cal. <comment1713> That's a pity. Just tried it with MobileMe, and it worked. Too bad that it is not for free. <comment37550> Here's your answer: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/27747/how-to-change-the-colors-of-calendars-on-ios5 <comment85661> Normally we close down to the oldest question, but in this case iOS 4 was hard to manage colors, iOS 5 got better and it's not an issue on iOS 6 as things now just work.
