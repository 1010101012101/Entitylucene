Automator - How to know what I can do with Automator in each app <body> I'm new to AppleScript and Automator, I've reached to stop and play next and previous track in Spotify, here's what I use inside the AppleScript:  precodetell application "Spotify" to playpause /code/pre  for play/pause^.  precodetell application "Spotify" to next track tell application "Spotify" to previous track /code/pre  for next and previous track^.  My question is, how can I know what else I can do with Spotify (or any other app) and automator, what any other word can I write instead "playpause", "next track" and "previous track". Thanks.  <answer186975> Automator and AppleScript are two very different things.  ul liFor Automator actions for a specific app, search for the name of the app in the Actions search bar.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FVRez.png" width="382"/li liFor AppleScript, open the Script Editor, then open the dictionary of the app by pressing ⇧⌘O and selecting the app. Apps not in the list probably don't have an AppleScript dictionary.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vei7E.png" width="618"/li /ul  <comment220916> Thanks for the fast and appropiate answer, Spotify does have an AppleScript dictionary but I don't quite understand how to use it so , I'll need a tutorial. <comment220918> @Dante Feel free to ask that as a separate question with a specific task that you wish to solve using a particular class/command from the dictionary. <comment220919> @Tetsujin I've voted to leave open—one can numerate the actions available in Automator for a particular app and use the dictionary for the app to list all the AppleScript classes for an app. <comment220939> Really, what I wanted was to be able to, from any app I had opened in that moment, as a service, add the song I was listening in that moment to one of my playlists with a keyboard shortcut but there's nothing about playlists in the dictionary, thanks anyway!
