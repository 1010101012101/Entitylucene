How to mount raw disk images? <body> I'd like to mount a raw dump of a disk, e. g. like those created by codedd/code? Is there something like a loop device in OS X?  <answer129979> You can create a disk image of the disk using Disk Utility. Select the disk or the disk's partition in the list on the left, then File → New → Disk Image from &lt;disk1.  Once the image is created, you can mount it like any other volume and if you selected read/write you can read/write to the image like a mounted volume. The image is mounted in the same place as the original disk would be: /Volumes/diskname.  <answer129983> For those encountering the same problem:  precodehdiutil attach -imagekey diskimage-class=CRawDiskImage -nomount filename /code/pre  then mount it as you like.

Rename it to a .dmg extension, as a DMG is a raw image too.  In contrast to the above solution, this will work on dd rips of entire drives in addition to partitions.  <comment152152> I feel like this might be an XY question — why do you want this? <comment152158> @grgarside I'd like to mount various dumps of floppis, hds, what so ever. Why does that matter? <comment152198> Well, I have an answer, but since I'm not sure why you want this, I don't know if it's suitable. <comment152201> This nearly fits my needs. Do you know a way to do directly mount them? <comment152202> @Max Could you clarify what you mean by 'directly'? <comment152203> I want to treat a file as if it was a character device and use `mount` on it. <comment152205> @Max I'm still not certain what you mean :) You can use mount on the mounted image like any other image and it is shown alongside the physical disks connected — what exactly of mount do you want to use? <comment152209> I have raw images created with `dd` for example. I want to mount those. I could create a dmg and `dd` the raw image onto it, then mount this dmg, but I'd like to mount it directly, something like `mount -t hfs path-to-file-created-using-dd /mountpoint`. Though, this is not possible, as `mount` only works with devices, not with usual files. On Linux I'd use loop-devices, pointing them to the file and use `mount` on them afterwards. <comment152211> Duplicate of http://serverfault.com/questions/174909/mount-block-file-on-osx <comment223185> Are you sure that dmgs don't habe a structure? They can be compressed, encrypted and have checksums... <comment223335> Firstly, there is a DMG file format family, but it's basically DD in it's core before crypto etc.  See here for more info: http://newosxbook.com/DMG.html  The important bit is in the second paragraph. Basic Hdiutil created DMGs are actually just renamed RAW dumps, with no identifying header, footer, metadata or wrapping of any sort. If and when you then try to compress/encrypt the data, a trailing block is created with instructions on how to crypto/comp format. When the mounter is done decrypting, it's a DD again. <comment303193> Late to the party but figured it was worth adding a +1 here. I just did this with a raw disk image from a 20 year old PC and it worked perfectly.
