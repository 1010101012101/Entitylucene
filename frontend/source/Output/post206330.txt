Re-map keys on keyboard <body> I know how to re-map my modifier keys, so my caps lock can act as a ctrl key, for example.  I'm wondering if there's a way to re-map they dash/underscore key (next to +/=). Instead of it producing a dash or hyphen, I'd like it to produce an em dash. And pressing shift+opt+dash (the current shortcut for an em dash) key would produce a normal dash.  Based on Karl's answer, I tried using BetterTouchTool (as Global shortcuts and also TextEdit specifically), but remapped keypresses just seem to be ignored.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IKqHu.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer206349> BetterTouchTool ( http://blog.boastr.net ) can re-map arbitrary keys. Under preferences, select the "keyboard" tab, then "+add New Shortcut", click in the "Keyboard Shortcut" then type the key you want to change. Then select "Trigger Other Keyboard Shortcut" and type in shift-opt-dash.  There might be simpler ways just for keyboard remapping, but BTT can do lots of other things too.  Hope this helps,  Karl  <answer206366> Install and launch Karabiner. In the menubar open the menulet Karabiner - Preferences. Then hit the tab "Misc &amp; Uninstall" and "Open private.xml"  Paste the following lines into the opened xml file:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;     &lt;item&gt;       &lt;name&gt;Swap Minus and Alt+Shift+Minus&lt;/name&gt;       &lt;identifier&gt;remap.minus_and_optionlshiftlminus&lt;/identifier&gt;       &lt;autogen&gt;         __KeyToKey__          KeyCode::MINUS, ModifierFlag::NONE,         KeyCode::MINUS, ModifierFlag::SHIFT_L | ModifierFlag::OPTION_L       &lt;/autogen&gt;       &lt;autogen&gt;         __KeyToKey__         KeyCode::MINUS, ModifierFlag::SHIFT_L | ModifierFlag::OPTION_L,         KeyCode::MINUS,       &lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  and save the file.  Return to the tab "Change Key", hit "ReloadXML"  and enable "Swap Minus and Alt+Shift+Minus". It should be the first entry listed.  If you are left-handed you may replace _L by _R in the xml file.  <answer206367> Caps lock key is a more special key and a lot of the key remapping program have trouble working with it. I personally use the app strongSeil/strong (https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/seil.html.en), previously called PCKeyboardHack to emremap my caps lock to backspace/em.  Here's a screenshot of the setting page in strongSeil/strong. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/d1PCi.png" alt="Seil setting page"  Also, as shown in the description above, you also need to set caps lock to strongNo Action/strong in Mac OS strongSystem Preference/strong. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BhWuC.png" alt="enter image description here"  You should then be able to remap the caps lock to any key you prefer.  <comment248744> great idea but unfortunately that didn't work. I posted a screenshot to my question. <comment248747> Change keyboard language setting? <comment248751> [Keyboard Maestro](http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/) should be able to do that (paid). You could also try [Karabiner](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/) or [Ukulele](http://scripts.sil.org/ukelele) (both free) but I don't have experience with those. <comment248763> thanks, but i'm trying to map my dash to em dash. <comment248934> lol, sorry I totally misread your question.
