Installing Leopard from DVD: Apple logo? <body> I need to install Leopard OSX on my mac.   When the mac starts, I hold the alt button and I load the Leopard Installation DVD. Afterwords I can only see the Apple logo on the screen and everything seems stuck (waited for 8 minutes so far).  How much am I supposed to wait to see the first istructions when loading the Installation DVD at boot time ?  thanks  <answer78799> You most probably won't be able to install this OS X version on your iMac:  ul li10.6.4 (which is Snow Leopard, not Leopard) was released June 15th, 2010 (Wikipedia)/li liiMac 12,2 was released mid 2011 (Apple Support Document)/li /ul  As a general rule you can't install older OS X discs on newer hardware (missing drivers etc.).  <comment91089> Is this the Leopard DVD initially delivered with your Mac? Which Mac model? <comment91090> @patrix Yes, delivered with a mac in the office (not sure if it is mine). Mac OS version 10.6.4 - Disc version 4.0 <comment91091> @Patrick - is your Mac newer than the one the DVD was delivered with? <comment91093> @Mark not sure about it, unfortunately :( <comment91094> And your Mac is which model/year? <comment91095> @patrix iMac12,2 - Intel Core i7
