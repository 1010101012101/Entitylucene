Is there a good, full-featured EPUB to PDF converter? <body> There are tons of PDF to EPUB converters but almost no EPUB TO PDF.  Only thing I've found is a free online converter (takes some time to upload, lacks the cover and the sidebar navigation) and a shareware (that I couldn't get to work).   <answer30700> Does Calibre work? It offers Ebook Format Conversion for a lot of formats, quote from the FAQ:     Calibre supports the conversion of many input formats to many output formats. It can convert every input format in the following list, to every output format.      Input Formats: CBZ, CBR, CBC, CHM, DJVU, EPUB, FB2, HTML, HTMLZ, LIT, LRF, MOBI, ODT, PDF, PRC, PDB, PML, RB, RTF, SNB, TCR, TXT, TXTZ      Output Formats: EPUB, FB2, OEB, LIT, LRF, MOBI, HTMLZ, PDB, PML, RB, PDF, RTF, SNB, TCR, TXT, TXTZ   <answer76705> You can try Go4ePub.com.   According to my experience the results are slightly better than with Calibre.  <answer161965> I recommend to try this free online converter convertio.co , I have used it for a very long time without any problems ever!  <comment35294> Not as far as I've tested, seems to be only a reader and library. <comment35297> Calibre definitely does conversions, that is the main thing I use it for and I just tested epub to pdf <comment35326> Oh ok, I had another try and indeed it does. The labelling of the menu options is a bit strange. @Mark do you have any tip on getting the sidebar bookmarks ? <comment35384> No I usually convert to epub as I want the display to choose how to show the text not the author so I want word wrapping etc - anything but pdf
