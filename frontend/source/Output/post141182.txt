Change the order of servers in "Connect to Server" window? <body> Running Mavericks (OS X 10.9.4) is it possible to change the order that the "favorite servers" are displayed in?  Allow me to explain a little more the use case. In Finder if one presses Command-K or uses the "Go" menu to "Connect to Server..." a dialog box appears. In the top portion of the dialog is the current server you are about to connect to and below it the servers you have indicated are your favorites. These favorites are set by clicking the + button to the right of server line at the top. After clicking the plus button, servers are added to the top of the favorite. This results in the most recent addition being at the top.  The server I want at the top of my favorites list is the one I am accessing most often, not the one that was just added. Ideally I would like to be able to place them in order as things change.  To illustrate further, right now my list looks like this:  ul liServer 3/li liServer 7/li liServer 5/li liServer 1/li liServer 2/li liServer 4/li liServer 6/li /ul  I would like to make it look like this:  ul liServer 1/li liServer 2/li liServer 3/li liServer 4/li liServer 5/li liServer 6/li liServer 7/li /ul  Is there a way to accomplish this task?   <answer141192> This worked for me:  Open this file in XCode: code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.sidebarlists.plist/code  Look inside the favoriteservers container.  Drag the servers into your desired order.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IayS1.png" alt="XCode .plist edit interface"  Save the file.  Log out.  Log in.  Done.  Also!  It sure looks like you have a separate value for Name and URL there!  I haven't tried it but it certainly would be handy to have the list display human-readable values instead of stuff like codeafp://10.8.8.67/code  <answer141193> The list is stored as an array in a dictionary named strongfavoriteservers/strong inside the code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.sidebarlists.plist/code file.  You should be able to modify the array with a plist editor, so that they display in your preferred order.  <comment166367> Not that I'm aware of.  I frequently fill in user's shares from the mapped drives of their old PCs and I've found that I just have to enter them in in reverse.  The first one you enter ends up at the bottom and the least you enter ends up at the top. <comment166372> related: http://superuser.com/questions/469900/where-are-the-connect-to-server-settings-stored-in-mac-os-x <comment166527> You can put in readable names by editing your hosts file. The names will show in the Shared portion of Finder, as well as being able to ping them and save them as your favorites.
