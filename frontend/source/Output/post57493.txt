Stop iTunes from opening when a device is plugged in? <body> Since re-installing OS X (10.8), every time I plug in an iOS device iTunes opens up and shows an error message:     iTunes could not connect to the iPhone "..." because it is locked with a passcode. You must enter your passcode on the iPhone before it can be used with iTunes.   I plug in various devices all the time, just so I can charge them. I do not want them connected to iTunes, I definitely don't want iTunes storing a copy of the device's passcode (or however that works) on my mac, and some of the devices plugged in aren't even mine.  How can I stop this from happening? It doesn't happen when I'm booted into 10.7 on the same mac, with the same iOS devices.  I already have "Prevent iPods, iPhones, and iPads from syncing automatically" enabled in Preferences.  emEDIT:/em this particular device also has "Open iTunes when this device is connected" turned off, so it seems to ignore that setting.  <answer57497> In iTunes there is an option to prevent the app to launch when a device is connected to your computer.     Open iTunes  Clic on a device in the sidebar  Scroll down to the "Options" section.   Then you have to make sure this little checkbox is un-check: itunes option http://f.cl.ly/items/2u3h1R2Q3L0k2n451f1W/Image%202012.07.26%2002:08:45.png  If the problem still occurs after that, come back here !  <answer80464> Under strongSettings/strong → strongUsers/strong → [you] → strongLogin Items/strong → select strongiTunesHelper/strong, then click the minus sign and log out/into your Mac.  No devices will cause iTunes to launch (that's the whole purpose of iTunesHelper).  <answer100045> Open codeiTunes -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Devices/code.  Make sure codePrevent iPods, iPhones, and iPads from syncing automatically/code option is strongchecked/strong.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GFMXd.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ReB0I.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer268313> The solution I found that worked since nothing else did for me was to rename the iTuneshelper.exe file before I plug in my iPhone. I use Explorer to get photos off my phone and this is the only way I could do that after I installed iTunes. Apple needs to really work on improving iTunes. I don't find it user friendly at all.  <comment66056> That was already unchecked. Also, I need this to work on other people's devices as well including ones where they might have this setting enabled. As part of my work, I regularly plug other people's devices into my mac. <comment66149> I Think that this settings is save for your computer only and it don't affects other computer, but i might be wrong. <comment66518> It was already turned off and I just did a clean install. So it must be stored on the device. <comment123648> Hiding iTunesHelper or clicking the minus sign didn't work for me. Do you have to restart your computer or log out? I also tried unlocking/locking (click the lock icon) on this same screen but that had no effect. Mac 10.7.5 iTunes 11.1 <comment123674> @timpeterson yes you'll need to log out. Also I think iTunes might occasionally put it back. :( <comment274237> This does not answer the OP's question. The OP has already stated in their question that this checkbox is already checked and yet the issue still persists. <comment353797> This does contribute information to the problem, because I already had iTunesHelper eliminated but was still having this problem, doing this fixed it.
