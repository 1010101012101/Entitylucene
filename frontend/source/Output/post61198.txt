sleep, screensaver and Filevault <body> I am mystified: first, I have an iMac and a mbp, both running mountain lion. In System Preferences  Security  General  Require Password after sleep or screensaver, I can adjust the time to 4 hours on the iMac, but it goes only as far as one hour on the mpb. To further complicate the matter, when I turn on Filevault, the checkbox for this option disappears on the mpb, so I can't totally disable it, but everything remains the same on the iMac. What exactly is going on here? I really want to disable this feature on the mpb, and I'd really appreciate if someone in the know can show me how to achieve that.  <comment70642> I don't want to enable FileVault, but does `defaults write com.apple.screensaver askForPassword -bool false` or `defaults write com.apple.screensaver askForPasswordDelay -int 14400` (and restarting) have any effect? <comment70652> i first went into system preferences and set requires password to immediately so i don't have to wait a long time to see the result. then i used the first command, it had no effect. then i tried the second one but changed the number to 300 so i can see the result sooner...no luck with that one, either. <comment89011> What outputs: `defaults read com.apple.screensaver`?
