Inactive iCloud account <body> My iPhone 5 keeps asking for an inactive iCloud password. I plugged my phone into my computer and it backed everything up to my last update of an old work phone. I inactivated an account because it was not matching my iTunes in my new phone. So I created a new iCloud to get the passwords all the same. Now it wants a password I cannot recover?  <comment213494> Start at https://iforgot.apple.com
