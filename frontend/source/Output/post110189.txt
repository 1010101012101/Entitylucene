Lost calendar icon on 4S iPhone <body> My calendar icon accidentally got deleted. How do I recover &amp; restore that icon to my screen.   <answer110191> At least on un-jailbroken phones it is not possible to delete the standard applications, so the icon (and the app) are still on your phone. Try to  ul liUse Spotlight search to search for "Calendar"/li liGo to Settings - General - "Reset" (last option) - Home Screen to reset the home screen to its factory state/li /ul  <answer110192> Calendar is a "system app", and because of this, the app can't be fully deleted.  This means that it's probably just been moved to one of your other screens.  Try doing a spotlight search for the application, by either going to the left-most page in iOS6, or by swiping down in iOS 7.  This emshould/em indicate the name of the folder it's hiding in.
