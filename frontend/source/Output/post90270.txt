Is there an app that will notify me (in notifications center) if a process is using up a high percentage of CPU for a specified amount of time? <body> The other day, I was sitting in a coffee shop working, when I looked down to find that 25% of my battery was left.   I looked at my Activity Monitor and saw that the time machine process was going at 90% for a while (as long as I was watching it).   Are there any apps that can notify me if a process is at a certain level for a certain amount of time?   <answer90295> You could run a script like this every minute with cron or launchd:  precode#!/bin/bash  cpulimit=50 prefix=${TMPDIR}cron_cpu current=$(ps -erco %cpu,command | tail -n+2 | sed 's/^ *//') echo "$current" &gt; $prefix$(date +%s) a=($prefix*); for ((i=0;i&lt;=${#a[@]}-3;i++)); do rm "${a[i]}"; done [[ $(awk '{s+=$1}END{printf "%i",s}' &lt;&lt;&lt; "$current") -lt $cpulimit ]] &amp;&amp; exit averages=$(awk '{cpu=$1;sub(/[^ ]+ /,"");a[$0]+=cpu;c[$0]++}END{for(i in a){printf "%.1f %s\n",a[i]/c[$0],i}}' $prefix* | sort -rn) if [[ $(awk '{s+=$1}END{printf "%i",s}' &lt;&lt;&lt; "$averages") -ge $cpulimit ]]; then     terminal-notifier -title "CPU use" -message "$(head -n5 &lt;&lt;&lt; "$averages" | paste -sd / -)" fi /code/pre  If the average CPU use in the last three samples is over 50%, it uses terminal-notifier to display the processes that used the most CPU.  You could also use MenuMeters to display total CPU use in the menu bar:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cWqcl.png" alt=""  Or run a script like this with GeekTool:  codefor i in {1..4}; do ps -erco %cpu,command | tail -n+2; sleep 1; done | sed 's/^ *//' | grep -v GeekTool | awk '{cpu=$1;sub(/[^ ]+ /,"");a[$0]+=cpu;c[$0]++}END{for(i in a){printf "%.1f %s\n",a[i]/c[$0],i}}' | sort -rn/code  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0Ptk2.png" alt=""
