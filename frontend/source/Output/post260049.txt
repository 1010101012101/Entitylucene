Quitting from an Automator App <body> I am running a simple Automator app which in turn runs a Bash command (which in turn is running an on going PHP process).  Currently the app sits in the menu bar with a spinning wheel. When I click on the item, it drops down with code80% completed/code, waiting for the PHP process to finish.  I can click on then codex/code on the menu item, but is there a more elegant way to quit from an automator app?
