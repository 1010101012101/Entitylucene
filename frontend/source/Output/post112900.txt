Cannot bring up MacVim 7.4 on Mac OS X 10.7.5 <body> I just installed MacVim 7.4 on Mac OS X Lion through macports, but I cannot bring it up? Typing mvim in the terminal invokes the application but doesn't bring up any window (and doesn't print anything to the terminal). mvim -v works though and brings up vim in the terminal.  Any idea why the GUI version doesn't work?  P.S. I also tried File - New Window. It doesn't work either.  Thanks!   <comment132525> I use MacPorts version 2.2.1 in case it helps. <comment132527> I reinstalled it and it just worked. spooky!
