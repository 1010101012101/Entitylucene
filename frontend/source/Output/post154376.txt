How to tell if a Retina MacBook Pro has gone to sleep when the lid is closed? <body> When I shut the lid on my Retina MacBook Pro (2014), how can I tell it's gone to sleep correctly?  On my previous MacBook Pro (~2008), the fans were audible, and there was a sleeping LED indicator in the lid latch that changed from "on" to "pulsing" when it was asleep. I used this as an "okay" sign to put it in the laptop bag.  Is there anyway to tell if a more recent MacBook Pro is asleep? I can't hear the fan most of the time, and I can't see any externally visible indicator lights that would indicate it's status.  I'm worried if it hasn't sleep correctly when I close the lid (occasionally this would happen with my old laptop) it will overheat when I put it in my bag.  <answer154379> One solution I have found is using a Yubikey. When the laptop is on the little press button glows. After shutting the lid it turns off after 20 seconds or so.  The Nano version also glows from what I can tell, and is small enough to leave in the USB slot permanently.  (Edited to add): This may not be the best idea. The yubikey acts appears as a keyboard to the OS. Had an issue recently where I'd closed the lid, but must have touched the yubikey, which behaving like a keyboard, woke the laptop back up with the lid closed. I didn't have time to test, but I feel like it would have stayed awake if I'd left it.  <answer194391> I don't think these laptops are quite capable of just 'failing to go to sleep' (it's not a problem I've ever read about before at least). If the lid is closed, it will go into that state, and it'll be safe to put in a bag.  One thing that might be worth a try is hunting around the system preferences to see if anything has the ability to take a laptop out of sleep mode, such as a bluetooth connection or receiving some data. Turning that off would stop the sleep problem.  I've checked the laptop all over, and the ridiculously useful light is gone. Future sucks.  <answer219221> It won't just overheat in its bag, but will also quickly drain its battery. I always press the power button for about 1 to 2 seconds before closing the lid. The screen will go dark when you release. If you hold it too long, a dialog will come up asking if you want to sleep or shutdown. Choose wisely.  <comment246945> I really think you have no idea what you are talking about: https://www.google.nl/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&es_th=1&ie=UTF-8#q=close+macbook+lid+without+turning+off <comment246946> too bad I can't downvote :)
