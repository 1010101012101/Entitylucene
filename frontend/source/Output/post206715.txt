Alcatraz - Xcode command line tools are not currently installed <body> I'm managing Xcode plug-ins via Alcatraz.  Everything was alright until I installed and then uninstalled Git following instruction in the uninstalled.sh file in official git.zip file:  precodesudo rm -rf /usr/local/git/    sudo rm /etc/paths.d/git    sudo rm /etc/manpaths.d/git /code/pre  I have no idea what I've done with git would affect Alcatraz. Once I click Package Manager in Xcode I get this error:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/S0aOF.png" alt="enter image description here"  Even re-install the Alcatraz it's still there.  strongUpdate/strong  I did install the Command Line Tool following Xcode Command Line Tool tutorial  Here's the message I got:  precodemyMacBook-Air:~ me$ gcc --version    Configured with:--prefix=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr --with-gxx-include-dir=/usr/include/c++/4.2.1   Apple LLVM version 7.0.0 (clang-700.0.72) Target: x86_64-apple-darwin14.5.0  Thread model: posix /code/pre  The Warning still pops up.  How could I fix this?  <answer206767> After installing emgit-2.5.3-intel-universal-mavericks/em you have at least three git executables on your Mac:   ul li/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/git (v2.3.8 (Apple Git-58))/li li/usr/local/git/bin/git (v2.5.3)/li li/usr/bin/git (which is a stub only)/li /ul  If you've followed the instructions in the emREADME.txt/em inside the emgit-2.5.3-intel-universal-mavericks.dmg/em you probably renamed the original git stub:  precodesudo mv /usr/bin/git /usr/bin/git-system /code/pre  Renaming or removing the stub already breaks Alcatraz.  You may now whether rename git-system:  precodesudo mv /usr/bin/git-system /usr/bin/git /code/pre  or reinstall git-2.5.3-intel-universal-mavericks and link the GIT-git to /usr/bin:  precodesudo ln -s /usr/local/git/bin/git /usr/bin /code/pre  to fix your issue.  <comment249167> Did you (re)install the command line tools as the error message suggests? <comment249171> @patrix nope ...did nothing with the command line tool. <comment249172> Then maybe you could do this as this seems to be the recommended way to solve the problem?! <comment249178> @patrix I found nothing to download in the Preference Downloads section. Also I did install the Command Line Tool via Terminal, please see the update. Error keeps showing up. <comment249254> Super effective! I installed git via official dmg file, and typing `which git` showed me `/usr/local/git/bin/git`. I did nothing with the file name. Anyway, thanks for saving my life!
