Missing emojis from iPhone English keyboard on iOS 9.3.1 <body> How do I restore missing emojis to the English keyboard on my iPhone 6? They were there, and after a reset of my phone and restoring it from a computer backup, the emojis are missing.  I tried rebooting my device and that didn't work. What should I do?  <answer242767> Go to Settings, then general, then keyboard, then keyboards, then add keyboards, then find "Emoji" and add it.  Edit: thanks Tom.  <answer246228> From this article:     ul   liNavigate to Settings → General → Keyboard → Keyboards/li   liTap "Add New Keyboard..."/li   liSelect "Emoji" from the list/li   /ul   <comment298717> Is the Emoji keyboard present on your list in settings/general/keyboard/keybords?  If not, add it. <comment298955> There is no keyboard listed for "Emoji", which is why I can't add it.What can I do to add that keyboard?? <comment299151> @SJCP try following this guide and tell me what happens: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202332 <comment303518> Welcome to Ask Different! It is better to provide a descriptive answer with the reference link, instead of an external link. <comment303532> This basically is the same procedure as mentioned in the other answer (and which doesn't seem to work for the OP) <comment303537> You should delete this, as it makes it look like you cannot read, since it the same thing as the answer from a month ago.
