To view images in iTunes Album Artwork Cache? <body> How can we view images stored in iTunes Album Artwork Cache?  What format are they? Is there anyway to see which Music Albums Artwork has been cached?   I have removed a bunch of music from my DB so I'd like to see which is still cached and which images are not. And maybe figure out which images can be useful.   <comment254966> Why do you want to view them? Just trash them if the folder gets too big. <comment255225> @IronCraftMan - I'd like to view them. Is there a way? <comment255251> Yes, through iTunes. The data is in a proprietary Apple format.
