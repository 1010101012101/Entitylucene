Why do I not get my messages sent through Jabber from other clients? <body> So when I'm logged into my gTalk/FB/iCloud accounts in the Messages app, I can send and receive everything fine.  But, when I send messages from Gmail or Facebook on their web clients, my messages do not appear in the Messages app.  I have a feeling it might have to do with Apple's implementation of the XMPP (Jabber) protocol.    Can anyone shed some light on the issue?
