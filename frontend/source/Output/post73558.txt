How do I keep just my iCloud contacts? <body> The Contacts app on my Mac has separate "On My Mac" and "iCloud" groups, but I really just want one set of contacts on iCloud that will be accessible on both my Mac and my phone.  Is there a way to merge the two sets of contacts and/or disable the "On My Mac" group?  <answer112581> With Mavericks (OSX 10.9) once iCloud syncing activated you will not have the top level "On My Mac" anymore.  On earlier version best would be to :  ol liSelect every contact "strongOn My Mac/strong" (cmd - A) and drag and drop them to your "strong~/Desktop/strong". This will create one VCF. To keep you group organisation you may want to proceed on a per group basis./li liDelete the selection of contacts./li liDelete the group(s)./li liMake sure in Contacts Preferences the default account is "strongiCloud/strong". If you are missing contacts on iCloud simply drag and drop back the VCF file to "strongAll iCloud/strong" or whatever group, you will be prompted to review duplicates./li /ol  <comment132208> Is there some special trick to activate iCloud syncing? I have Mavericks, am logged into iCloud, but I still see distinct "iCloud" and "On My Mac" groups in Contacts <comment132213> This means that iCloud Contacts is enabled. Do you have any contacts inside the "On My Mac group" when you click on it ? If so you should remove them, if not make sure the default account selected is iCloud.
