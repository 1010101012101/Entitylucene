Find device name "/dev/tty*" <body> On Ubuntu, I can use codels /dev/tty*/code to find the name of the device plugged on USB (often code/dev/ttyUSB0/code).   On OS X, I used, codeioreg -p IOUSB -w0/code and I found my device:  precodeUSB2.0-Serial@14200000  &lt;class AppleUSBDevice, id 0x100000b74, registered, matched, active, busy 0 (1 ms), retain 19&gt; /code/pre  However, I'm using pySerial which needs the codettyUSB**/code format.  I found answers to this, like Terminal to Serial/USB Devices From a Mac, but I couldn't see my device in the list, so there might be another way.  Any input will me much appreciated.
