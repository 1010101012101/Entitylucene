How to activate System Text-Replacement for Atom? <body> Related question  I have configured some text replacements in my local machine, via codePreferences &gt; Keyboard &gt; Text/code, including a lot of code shortcuts, including shortcuts for my own developed system urls, that are not emby-default/em suggested by Atom, such as:  precodeapj -&gt; application/json epc -&gt; events/panels/criteria hurl -&gt; http://my.home.url/ /code/pre  But I can't get them to work in Atom. Any ideas? Is this already implemented in Atom?  <comment304417> As a side note: Atom is built on Electron which is built on Chromium; so it is possible the roots to the problem are the same as in the related question you linked to. <comment353592> This question was made before I knew the concept of `snippets`. This is what solved my problem, it's awesome! http://flight-manual.atom.io/using-atom/sections/snippets/
