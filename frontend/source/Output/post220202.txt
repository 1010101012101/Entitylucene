Mac mini boots into black screen in dual screen setup <body> can't seem to fix this. I have a Mac mini 2012 with two monitors and for some reason the computer boots into a black screen when they are both connected. It was fine previously. With only one monitor connected this is not an issue.  Any ideas on how to fix this?  <comment266508> Have you checked the cable ? <comment266519> Yes- I have to unplug it, start the computer and then plug it in. Cable is fine.
