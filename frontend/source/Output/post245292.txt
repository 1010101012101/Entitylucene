Am having problems with my WiFi and bluetooth <body> My iPhone6 fell down the stairs about five steps and since then my WiFi and Bluetooth have stopped working.  I even flashed my iPhone6 still they both don't work.    How can I fix this problem because there is no local Apple stores in Nigeria?  <answer245357> Your first stop should be Apple Support Nigeria: https://support.apple.com/en-ng Go through the steps listed to try to find a solution to your problem. Otherwise, you can often contact a dedicated Apple Support employee.   If these options fail to provide success, there are always companies which fix iPhones, in every country. Apple Stores are even often more expensive than these independent retailers. Check around the internet to find one near you.  <comment302475> Can you add some details regarding the things you did after the phone fell down? What do you mean with flashing (what exactly did you do)? How do you notice that Wifi/BT ain't working? Can't you turn them on on the phone, can you turn them on but they don't see other networks, do you see other networks but can't connect?
