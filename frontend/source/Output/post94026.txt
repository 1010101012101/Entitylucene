Make desktop items only appear in a certain region <body> How do I make my desktop items on my mac desktop, instead of spreading all over the desktop, just spread in a certain region of the desktop?  <comment110212> I havenâ€™t used it, but [One Thing Well](http://onethingwell.org) linked to a piece of software called [Desktop Groups](http://kitestack.com/desktopgroups/) which lets you group related files on the desktop. The screenshots look like they let you group files spatially; this might be useful for you. <comment110213> @AlexChan Not available in the Australian Mac App Store :(
