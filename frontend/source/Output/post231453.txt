HELP! Keynote 6.5.3 - How to set presentation to "Browse by an Individual" (window)? <body> Can anyone please tell me where I can find the setting to set my slideshow to "Browse by an Individual (window)" so that I can use it inside GoToWebinar without presenting in full slide mode?  I searched high and low on Google + YouTube but found nothing of help.  Thanks so much.  Nika
