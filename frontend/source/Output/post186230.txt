How to get read receipt with Outlook for Mac 2011 with more than one mail account? <body> Regarding How do I request a read receipt when sending e-mail with Outlook for Mac 2011?:  There is a solution which I havent applied yet because it seemed for a single account. Is it possible to go for these steps twice to get read receipt for two accounts, depending on which has sent the email?  <answer186234> I think which the solution is emulate to MailTrack.io  i.e. add a invisible image hosted in cloud and to be verify if it was requested. But I don't know if it is posible in Outlook for Mac 2011.  <comment219804> I would simply add this as a comment but my rep points are not enough <comment219861> That answer is for Mail.app, not Outlook.
