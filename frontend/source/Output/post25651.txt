How can I change the meta key on OS X Lion's Terminal.app? <body> Is there any way to use "Option" as the meta key in OS X Lion's Terminal.app? The checkbox that was present in Snow Leopard is nowhere to be found.  <answer25659> Are you sure that it's not to be found?  If I look at Preferences → Settings → Keyboard, the checkbox for Use option as meta key is at the bottom.  I am on 10.7.1 so it emmay/em be something overlooked in the GM of Lion and fixed in the first patch.  <answer99183> I came here an hour ago with the same question and now I feel the answer need to be better elaborated. So:  ol liOpen the Terminal. The terminal menu should appear near to the apple icon./li liClick codeTerminal --&gt; Preferences.../code The settings dialog box should pop up./li liClick the codeSettings/code tab on upper left side of the dialog box, then you should be able to choose the codeKeyboard/code button. /li /ol  The codeUse Option as meta key/code check box should be visible on the lower border by the center. And you are done.  <comment29130> Nope, you're 100% right. No idea how I missed it...
