Restrict WiFi Between Designated Hours iOS Devices <body> Is there a method I can employ that will allow me to block or disable the WiFi of an iOS device between specific hours of the day?  I am unable to find an iOS equivalent, even looking at installing a profile has come up short on this problem.  It is to restrict the WiFi connectivity on workplace devices between specific hours so that employees do not have the situation they can be distracted between our busiest period 10am to 11:30am each day, and not be able to re-enable it.  On Android there is a program called Freedom that will block the WiFi access. But we use iOS based devices (iPhones and iPods) and I want to be able to enforce a similar process. App or profile otherwise.  Any suggestions?  <comment170620> and who is controlling the WiFi router (HotSpot) <comment170627> Just turn off the WiFi hot spot. <comment170649> As has been pointed out this should be a function of the router, and not the client.  Many routers do have access control features that can be based on time of day.
