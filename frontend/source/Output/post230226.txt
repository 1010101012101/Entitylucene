localhost loads default apache page <body> I'm setting up a localhost and everything looks like it should work but whenever I go to site.local it loads the default Apache localhost page (It works!).  Here's a copy of my hosts file:  precode## ## # Host Database # # localhost is used to configure the loopback interface # when the system is booting. Do not change this entry. ## 127.0.0.1    localhost 255.255.255.255 broadcasthost ::1 localhost fe80::1%1o0 localhost  #####  DEV ##### # SITE 127.0.0.1    site.local ::1          www.site.local /code/pre  and my vhost:  precode&lt;VirtualHost *:8080&gt;     ServerAdmin test@test.com     ServerName site.local     DocumentRoot "/Users/me/site"     ErrorLog "/Applications/MAMP/logs/site.local-error_log"     CustomLog "/Applications/MAMP/logs/site.local-access_log" common     &lt;Directory "/Users/me/site"&gt;         Options Indexes FollowSymLinks         AllowOverride All     &lt;/Directory&gt; &lt;/VirtualHost&gt; /code/pre  Things I've done to make sure it isn't a user error:  ul liuncommented the line in the httpd.conf file to include my vhost file/li liused codeapachectl configtest/code to test my file (came back saying syntax OK)/li /ul  Things to note:  ul liI use port 8080 and 3307 for Apache and MYSQL/li liIf I go to site.local:8080 it loads but doesn't render the elements as it should (instead loads the elements of the html in a list format)/li lithis is off a FRESH install of MAMP/li liOS: OS X Yosemite version 10.10.5/li liMAMP Version: 3.5/li /ul  I just don't see what's going wrong... any ideas?  strongUPDATE/strong  localhost works as it should with port 80. 8080 = the default apache page, but 80 loads the site pages...  <answer230260> Based on your comment that when you go to site.local:8080 you get a white page with the words "It Works!" similar to the screen capture below  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/K3Virm.png" alt="It Works!"  What you are seeing is the webpage based on the strongemglobal server configuration/em/strong where the emDocumentRoot/em is whatever default MAMP is set for.  You mention in your OP that      If I go to site.local:8080 it loads but doesn't render the elements as it should (instead loads the elements of the html in a list format)   Apache isn't going to render your webpage as a HTML list (unless you tell it to).  More than likely what you are seeing is a directory listing similar to this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EY77Nm.png" alt="Index Listing"  You get that listing because of the line codeOptions Indexes FollowSymLinks/code in your codehttpd.conf/code file.  If you want to disable this, remove the word emIndexes/em from that line and the listing will no longer show up.  Your Virtual Host Configuration  First, we need to understand how Apache handles virtual host requests.  From the Apache documentation:     When a request arrives, the server will find the best (most specific)   matching  argument based on the IP address and port used   by the request. If there is more than one virtual host containing this   best-match address and port combination, Apache will further compare   the ServerName and ServerAlias directives to the server name present   in the request.      If you omit the ServerName directive from any name-based virtual host,   the server will default to a fully qualified domain name (FQDN)   derived from the system hostname. This implicitly set server name can   lead to counter-intuitive virtual host matching and is discouraged.   If you notice, strongemyour host that is defined the global server configuration/em/strong is the same as the virtual host.     This is probably where you are getting your error.  Now, my fix for this is a bit more involved initially, but infinitely more efficient because I try to avoid turing my machine into both a client strongemand/em/strong a server.  I do all my development on a Mac with a Virtual Machine running my AMP server.  This way I can mirror my production environment much closer and I don't have unnecessary services (like Apache and MySQL) running on OS X; they are all relegated to the VM.  The VM has it's own IP, own server name, everything so when I point my browser to it, I know what results to expect.  I have a write up on how to install a FreeBSD VM on VirtualBox running on a Mac that has autostart enabled.  If you are interested, I can share it with you.  <answer230470> strongPreface:/strong  ol liExecuting codeapachectl configtest/code doesn't check em/Applications/MAMP/conf/apache/httpd.conf/em for consistency but the default OS X Apache config file em/private/etc/apache2/httpd.conf/em.

If you've set up your MAMP server properly and copied the default MAMP files emindex.php/em and emMAMP-PRO-Logo.png/em to the folder /Users/me/site you will see the following "default" page:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OZilI.png" alt="MAMP website default start page"  Entering emhttp://localhost:8080//em in the browser will show the same page.  If you run no other instance of Apache (especially the default OS X Apache) you won't be able to connect to localhost:80 or site.development:80.  hr  If you run another instance of Apache (e.g. started by launchd or invoked by codesudo apachectl start/code you can connect to it by either entering localhost:80, site.development:80 or http://site.development:80. You will see the default Apache page:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/K3Virm.png" alt="enter image description here"  If OS X Server is installed additionally you'll get to a "Welcome to OS X Server" page after entering localhost:80 even if emWebsites/em is disabled in Server.app:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VTkqY.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment280958> Can you post an screen shot of your browser with it on site.local:8080? <comment280959> I can't no (not enough rep to upload one) - all it shows is a white page with 'it works!' in a h1 tag <comment280962> I'm not seeing a `NameVirtualHost *:8080` directive prior to `VirtualHost` directive. <comment280963> It's there (full vhost isn't posted) <comment280967> It would help if you posted that as well (use pastebin).  Is your server configured to Listen on 8080 as well? <comment280969> Keep in mind that you have to go to `site.local:8080` (with the 8080) in there or it won't work. Also, is it index.php or index.html that you are serving from your document root? If it is PHP, you need to set up PHP to parse the files and then configure Apache to let PHP parse files with .php. Course MAMP should be doing most of that for you. <comment280970> @bassplayer7 I don't usually have to specify port to access my localhost? (I've had previous experience with other localhosts) <comment280976> @Allan it is indeedy (it's running from my machine) and I can but it is the default httpd-vhost file just with the above added <comment280978> HTTP's default port is 80 (TLS is 443), so I would estimate that you had configuration set up to work with port 80. Browsers will load port 80 without showing you that is the case. If you set up your Vhost for anything other than port 80 (again, unless you have a different scheme), then you will need to specific direct the browser to that. <comment280980> @bassplayer7 well MAMP's default port is 8888 (which is stupid to begin with) so I changed it to 8080, changed name server, the *:8888 to *:8080, and MAMP does the rest for you in the httpd.conf, I have to have 8080 (to test localhost on Android devices Chrome requires port 1024 - 9999). Any other OS would work, with XAMPP on windows I have a different port that's changed easily and still works without specifying port, same with Linux, with Linux it's really eay.. just don't understand why MAMP + os x makes everything ten times harder haha <comment281000> @klanomath sure will do so now <comment281008> @TT12043205 Please add the paths of the files you are mentioning/editing. You have at least two relevant vhost files: one in MAMP and one in /etc/apache/.... Do you also run the OS X httpd daemon? What the purpose of localhost:80? <comment281019> I absolutely agree that VMs are the best approach. That is something that I think the Mac really does well with. If you just need a simple box to run a CMS or something, Homestead is probably the easiest and quickest way to do that. <comment281025> Exactly...I, prefer to use VirtualBox with a FreeBSD host configured as close to what the hosting providers give you so there is little or no fixing of things when you try to upload your site to a production server. <comment281147> it doesn't show the file structure, it shows the html but without any styling. And it isn't the MAMP default page it's showing, it's showing apache's (MAMP's page is a weird hub kinda page). I could use a VM but I shouldn't have to.. I can do this on Linux and Windows easily, os x is the only one that makes life difficult? (sorry if this seems ranty haha) <comment281148> @klanomath the vhost is the mamp default one /Applications/MAMP/conf/apache/extra/httpd-vhost - not touched the /etc/ one <comment281195> @TT12043205 Please sanitize your question. At least for me it's more and more unclear what you are asking, which results you are getting and which files you are editing and finally which results you want! Your **updates** don't help much either if you don't add what you have changed. <comment281256> Can you post your httpd.conf and the results to a shared folder like OneDrive, Google Drive or Dropbox?  It's very hard to diagnose when you can see the code. <comment281328> the apachectl tests my MAMP one (I know this because I purposely created a bad vhost and it came back with the errors) - but aside from that I'll give this a go :) thanks
