Apps in Dock creating new icon <body> I have just changed to Sierra - 10.12.4  Some apps (e.g. Aquamacs, Moneywell) in the Dock when you start them do not get a mark saying they are running but create a new icon that represents the running instance. This icon seems to have as its app one under /private/var/folders but with the correct app name not one in /Applications  Why is this happening and how can I get things back to how previous OSX versions worked.  <answer280100> The issue is caused by Gatekeeper. It uses "path randomization" to run applications, until the user moves the app in it's final destination (/Applications for example). This causes the app to be run from code/private/var/../code and Dock treats this as a new app.  To remove the quarantine attribute execute (removes recursively com.apple.quarantine):  codesudo xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Application/SomeApp.app/code  Recursion (the -r flag) may be needed for apps that contain helpers.  To list the current attributes for an app execute:  codesudo xattr /Application/SomeApp.app/code  or   precodels -l@d /Application/SomeApp.app /code/pre  Sources:  On Gatekeeper and the Lifespan of Little Snitch Rules  <comment351230> Would you be able to specify one such app that is behaving thusly? It's probably that the app has a wrapper that then launches an executable and you would need the vendor to change the app - but rather than shoot off guesses - could you narrow down with an edit one such app? <comment352255> This is because the app is quarantined. De-quarantine the app by running `sudo xattr -d com.apple.quarantine -r "/Application/SomeApp.app"` <comment352264> @mspasov That is basically correct - the command should not have a -d. If you write that up as an answer together with the reasoning/documentation. That does lead to another question why have I just started getting the issue, in the last week I have upgraded the OS and my browser Vivaldi <comment352265> @mark Without `-dr` the flag will not be removed, it will only print the flags. Are you sure? <comment352266> @mspasov the exact command you say gave an error "xattr: No such file: -r" amnd -d on its own seemed to have worked for the second app <comment352267> @mark my bad, should be fixed in my answer.
