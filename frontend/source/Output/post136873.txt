How to edit iOS system file on my iPad over SSH? <body> I have an iPad with iOS 7.1.1. I jailbroke it and was able to ssh it from wifi without a problem.  Lately I wanted to edit some system files to tweak few settings but I realized that there is no vi (or any other file editor) in the file system. Is there anyway I can install 'ios version of vi' or any other file editor?  I don't want to install independent app for it (such as iFile)â€”I need an editor which works in shell.  <answer136874> You can install nano or vi from Saurik's repo.  <comment162483> thank you George! This is exactly what I was looking for! <comment162849> `sudo apt-get install vim`
