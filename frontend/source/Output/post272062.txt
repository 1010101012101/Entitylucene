WiFi indicator off on iPhone 7 while connected to a Wifi network <body> I keep the WiFi on my iPhone 7 always on and connected to my home or work networks, but often the connection is not shown neither in the top bar nor in the settings even though it is obvious that WiFi is on and connected:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7WnGR.png" alt="enter image description here"  When I toggle it back on, the device remains connected, but after some time this happens again.  Another example of an inconsistency:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Oq5GA.png" alt="enter image description here"  Additional information:  ul liThis happens since I bought it new a few months ago./li liI have the latest iOS, and I did reset my device a couple of times./li liIt happens with different networks./li /ul  How to solve this problem?
