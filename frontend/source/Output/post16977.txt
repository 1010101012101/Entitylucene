Wireless or Wired Apple keyboard for programming? <body> Why one or the other?  I don't use the numpad nor much of the functional keys (delete, insert, etc.).  The latency with the wireless worries.  What are your experiences?  <answer16978> I use the Wireless Apple Keyboard and there isn't any noticeable lag when using it. Unless you program emreally really/em quickly, I don't see a problem with using the wireless keyboard.  The only problem with the keyboard is when it is far away from the Mac - the Bluetooth signal could weaken and slow down the process.  <answer16981> I prefer the wired version primarily because it has a 10-key pad, the dedicated page up/down and home/end keys, and the arrow keys aren't so tiny.  <answer16982> I would also recommend the wireless keyboard (keeping any old USB one around only for maintenance boots/backup).  My dream setup is a Twelve South MagicWand connecting a Magic trackpad with the bluetooth keyboard. Gestures are so powerful in Xcode and for swiping windows around. Lion is just going to make that input method better. I expect it will be a one year period of weaning myself from my mouse. For now it's still always on my desk and ready, but I'm starting to use it less as I get more proficient on the trackpad.  More info on the MagicWand is here. As I commented below on another answer for wireless, I've never seen lag as the device disconnects with a nice animation on the mac screen if it's not a reliable and fast connection.  <answer16984> I use the wired keyboard primarily because it has two easy access USB ports.  <answer161558> I have never seen slowness on the Wireless of any sort, latency is not an issue. Period.  On the other hand, key feel emis/em an issue. The key mechanisms are different between Wired and Wireless; its harder to press the keys on the Wireless and it has a mushy feel.  I tried one because I never used the numeric keypad (and I am a programmer) and was fine with the re-located cursor keys. The feel was so poor that my typo rate emsoared/em. Even a few hours of trying it prompted me to return it.  I do want to try the older Compact Wired version. If it uses the say keys as the current wired, I'll switch.  <comment18511> Don't sweat wired or wireless. Use whatever you're comfortable working with for very long stretches of time. In my case that will *never* be a "chiclet" type keyboard. <comment18512> I've always had fast response up to 30 feet away and never seen slowness. It seems to drop the connection entirely before lag due to retransmissions gets bad or even noticeable. <comment18514> cool, i've never seen those before.
