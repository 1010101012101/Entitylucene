Compatability of Macbook Air with HP 23fi <body> Is HP Pavilion 23fi monitor compatible with Macbook Air?  <answer131695> The HP Pavillion 23fi monitor has the following inputs:  ul li1 VGA/li li1 DVI-D/li li1 HDMI/li /ul  Because Macbook Air has only Thunderbolt output (or Mini DisplayPort for previous models) you need an adapter to use it with this monitor.  <comment154753> Could you expand on what you mean by compatible?
