How do you hide the subject field of iMessages on OS X? <body> Is there a way to hide the subject field of messages which appear in the top right corner of the screen when I receive an iMessage on my computer? I know there is a way to hide it on messages that come to my iPhone. Is there a way to do the same on Mac OS X?  <answer174060> I'm not sure what you mean for sure, but take a look under system pref and notifications you might find your answer here img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tOU77.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer174075> To clarify on what @Macmaniman posted, you'll want to change a setting with your notifications. To do this, go to your Settings app  Notifications (upper right corner)  Messages (in the left-hand column). Uncheck codeShow message preview/code, which will hide the message previews (or subject fields, as you refer to them).  Hope this helps!  <answer174096> I actually think he means the actual subject line above the actual message (it splits the input text area in two, see screenshot).  I haven't found this option in iMessage anywhere on Yosemite though...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tKQTa.png" alt="enter image description here"
