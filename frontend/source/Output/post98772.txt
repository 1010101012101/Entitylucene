Remote calendars stopped syncing with OS X Calendar <body> One day both my Exchange calendar and Google Calendar stopped syncing with iCal (Mountain Lion's Calendar application). No error message or whatsoever was displayed; remotely created events just didn't show up in the Calendar application.  I've tried deleting and readding the accounts and even completely deleting the Calendar app's settings:  precodesudo rm -Rf ~/Library/Calendars/* sudo rm -Rf ~/Library/Caches/com.apple.iCal sudo rm ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iCal.plist /code/pre  After adding my Google Calendar account, I get an empty "Google" calendar group with no actual calendar inside:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ss5qo.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MCn5x.png" alt="enter image description here"  The very same is happening if I add an Exchange account. However, on my iPhone all calendars work just fine.
