Printing the current date/time with sub-second precision <body> GNU codedate(1)/code understands the code%N/code format spec, which outputs nanoseconds, so:  precode$ date +%H:%m:%S.%N /code/pre  outputs 19:10:03.725196000  BSD date doesn't understand %N. How can I print the current time with sub-second precision on OS X?  <answer47181> As you said, BSD codedate/code doesn't support code%N/code. So the straightforward solution is to download GNU's codedate/code and install it to either code~/bin/code or code/usr/local/bin/code and call that when you need to use code%N/code.  However, I would not advise replacing the version that ships with your mac with the new one. Most of these coreutil programs are written such that their output can be understood by emother programs/em, not necessarily humans. So reliability in output is a necessity. There might be several scripts in your mac that parse the output of emBSD's/em codedate/code and any possible changes introduced by replacing with GNU's might or might not break things.  hr  The simplest way to do this safely on a mac is to use codehomebrew/code and install coreutils.  precodebrew info coreutils coreutils 8.16 http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils ...    ==&gt; Caveats All commands have been installed with the prefix 'g'. /code/pre  The GNU equivalent will be named codegrate/code and is located in code/usr/local/Cellar/coreutils/8.16/bin//code. You can also set an alias in your code.bashrc/code or its equivalent as   precodealias date='gdate' /code/pre
