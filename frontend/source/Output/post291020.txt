How to reduce macbook pro 15in (late 2015) temperature <body> Macbook pro 15in late 2015, bought in June 2016 keeps pushing fans to 4000 rpm or above, and temperature rising to 60 C or more with only chrome running.  When I check the activity monitor the process using more resources is the activity monitor itself or the kernel_task.  Paranoid enough or coincidently this started to happen when the warranty ended and around the same date I reinstalled the OS.  Already tried the SMC and RAM reset, still the same thing.  Does it have a learning curve after a reinstallation?  I am currently using SMC fan control and seems to help, at least temperature is at 56C, fans at 3188 and I do not hear the fans very much. Without that, it sounds like a turbo car engine.  Any tips?
