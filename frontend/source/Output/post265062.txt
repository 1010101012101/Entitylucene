Can I run Spotify by pressing my F8 button instead of iTunes? <body> Is it possible to program the F8 key to run Spotify instead of iTunes?  <answer265202> F8 does not start iTunes app in a regular way. It's a kind of intra-system shortcut for launching a privileged default music app in macOS, which always will be iTunes. You can set F8 for launching Spotify using Automator or third party apps, but then this key will lost its play/pause functionality.  <answer265215> The simplest way to do this, is to set Spotify to codeOpen at Login/code. As long as iTunes is not opened, Spotify will get priority when you hit any of the special keys.  Alternatively you can install a little helper tool. Try these instructions from the Spotify Community Forum:  Download Bubo (https://github.com/jguice/mac-bt-headset-fix#beta-version) and move application to the Applications folder  Then go into your Mac System Preferences -- Users and Groups -- Login Items --  ul liRemove Itunes Helper/li liAdd Bubo/li /ul  Done!  <comment332316> By "run", do you mean "start the application" or "start to play the current track"? <comment332452> I mean "start the application" :)
