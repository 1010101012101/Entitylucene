Three Finger Gesture on 2007-2008 Macbook Pros <body> Is the three finger gesture supported for the 2007-2008 nonunibody macbook pros? Wondering if I can change spaces on Mountain Lion.  <answer78939> No, sorry.   See this: Are non-unibody macbook pros capable of lion's 3 and 4 finger multi-though gestures?  And this: Pinch to zoom on macbook pro 2007  If you would like to use these gestures you can buy a magic trackpad or magic mouse from Apple.  <comment91317> So, it should work only on a non-unibody 2008 then? <comment91368> If you're lucky, and have a very late non-unibody, it might work using bettertouchtool, mentioned in the linked questions. But if the option is not present in System Preferences, you're likely out of luck.
