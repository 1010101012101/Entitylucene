How to strip file extension in applescript (In Automator)? <body> strongEDIT:/strongbr This is the working code for an AppleScript Automator service to encode (ffmpeg) a user selected file to a user selected directory, keeping the the original file name with a new extension.:br  precodeon run {input, parameters}      --choose destination folder     set path1 to (choose folder)     set path2 to quoted form of POSIX path of path1      --reduce extension from source file name and set to unix path     tell (info for input) to set {Nm, Ex} to {name, name extension}     set filename to text 1 thru ((get offset of "." &amp; Ex in Nm) - 1) of Nm     set in_file to POSIX path of input      --make new folder with source file name     tell application "Finder"         make new folder at path1 with properties {name:filename}     end tell      --run ffmpeg shell script (put whatever command you need here)     tell application "Terminal"         do script "ffmpeg -y -i " &amp; in_file &amp; " -c:v copy -c:a copy " &amp; path2 &amp; "/" &amp; filename &amp; "/" &amp; filename &amp; "_copy.mp4"     end tell end run /code/pre  I hope this will help people struggling with AppleScript and asking themselves why-oh-why Apple prevents shell scripts from showing their progress.  <answer194965> precodetell application "Finder" to if name extension of item 1 of (get selection) is "mov" then set name extension of item 1 of (get selection) to "mp4" /code/pre  <comment232741> Thanks. Can you elaborate on how to implement this in my (newly edited) original code?
