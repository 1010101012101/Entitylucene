Normal size of alias folder <body> I just delated an alias folder and I saw that the size in the bin was around 1.3 Mbit is this normal? Shouldn't be around few Kbyte?  <answer211393> Looks about right to me, just tested with a random folder, made an alias, threw it in the trash...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1PTZU.png" alt="enter image description here"  Comparatively, I tested against a small jpg image. Image was 273KB, alias is 957KB  <comment255166> Quite strange, anyway thanks.
