300% of my CPU is being used? <body> I ran a Java applet, and it used over 200% of my CPU....  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/R3rVf.png" alt="%CPU 273.5"  It actually rose to over 400% after I took the screenshot.  How is this possible? Did Apple secretly hide extra cores on my Macbook, or did they fundamentally alter the laws of Mathematics for their own products? I'd assume not, but you never know....  Seriously now though, can someone explain why Activity Monitor shows a task as using more than 100% of my CPU?  <answer240207> The CPU percentages shown in Activity Monitor are 100% for each virtual core. If you have a quad core processor with hyperthreading, 'real' 100% is 800% in Activity Monitor.  <comment295117> Please refer to this thread. http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/226281/how-does-my-dual-core-i5-in-my-macbook-pro-have-more-than-400-cpu-usage/226702#226702
