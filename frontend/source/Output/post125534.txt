Thunderbird and other apps in Maverics' notice panel <body> Is there a way to tell which app is using my notices panel from Maverics (opened by fingers slide from right side to left)?  I am particularly intrested in displaying Thunderbird's new message indicators there, but it boils down to actually setting notices for anything I want there.  Any manual or sources would be helpful.  <answer125551> Go to System Preferences  Notifications.  All apps which have the ability to display notifications will be listed here.  If it is not listed here, then it won't work with the notifications sidebar.
