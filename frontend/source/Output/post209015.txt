Why can't I change a restricted System file after doing csrutil disable? <body> I want to change a file in code/System/Library/Input Methods/PressAndHold.app/Contents/Resources//code but even after disabling codecsrutil/code in recovery mode still I get this flags with code-ls -lO &lt;filename&gt;/code: code-rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel  restricted,compressed 6365 23 Aug 03:55 Keyboard-de.plist/code  UPDATE: I just figured out, that I can change the ownership now, so I should be able to cp and rm the file I want to change. Still when I am opening the file with textedit I can't do anything, but I think this should be possible too.  EDIT: To check if SIP is still on, type codecsrutil status/code in the terminal. With SIP on it's impossible to change those files as any user.  codesudo nano/code worked just fine. Thanks for all the help!  <answer209016> The restricted flag only applies with System Integrity Protection enabled. It tells SIP which files to protect. If you disable SIP, the restricted flag has no effect.  Disabling SIP doesn't give emyou/em permission to the files though. You'll still need sudo or change the permissions yourself to edit the files.  <comment252065> Did you try to edit the file with `sudo`? <comment252066> When I am doing this `sudo open Keyboard-de.plist ` I can't change anything. <comment252068> Try `sudo nano Keyboard-de.plist` <comment252069> And `sudo touch /usr/bin/crazy-name-which-doesnt-exist`. If this fails, SIP is still active <comment252070> It didn't fail! Thanks :D I just touched something crazy!  I believe I should enable this SIP again, righty? <comment252071> Thanks a ton. Still I haven't got, why nano is 'stronger' than textedit. <comment252072> @Dennis TextEdit, like other GUI apps, run as the current user. `sudo open …` runs open as sudo, not TextEdit. [If you want to open TextEdit as root, you need to run the binary as root.](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/20199/how-do-i-open-a-file-as-root-in-textedit-on-lion) Alternatively, use a different GUI editor which handles edits to files like this—I recommend TextMate. <comment252074> Thanks for the quick response. This resolved the issue completely now. <comment252075> Delete the crazy file first, then enable SIP, yes
