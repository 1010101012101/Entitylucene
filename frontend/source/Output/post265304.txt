How can I aggregate 2 audio sources into one? <body> I need the output sound from my mac to be sent to the recording app, as well as the recorded sound from the microphone, while I hear in my headphones only the output sound (without hearing my voice). So far I tried using Aggregate Devices and I managed to set the Output+Mic sound, but I wasn't able to hear anything in my headphones. Can someone help me on this one? Also, I'm using Soundflower. Can this also be achieved without using any third-party apps like Soundflower? Thanks in advance.
