Copy and pasting between host and VM <body> I have a host machine running OS X 10.9.3 and VirtualBox 4.3.12 VM running Windows 7. I want to copy and paste between the host machine and the VM. By default copy-pastes don't seem to be transferable between machines. How can I do this?   There were some similar questions but using Linux/VMWare but the solutions have been specific to the VM in use.  <answer132248> It's not by default. If you have installed Guest Additions, then you can do this:  ol liStart the VM/li liGo to codeMachine &gt; Settings/code in the file menu./li liGo to the codeGeneral/code tab, then codeAdvanced/code./li liSet the codeShared Clipboard/code setting to codeDisabled/code, codeGuest to Host/code, codeHost to Guest/code or codeBidirectional/code./li /ol  <comment290408> Waitaminnit -- are you saying that Guest Additions are now available for OS X?  If so, where do I get them? <comment290423> @fearless_fool click the link to guest additions in the answer :) <comment292086> That's exactly my point: the docs specifically state that Guest Additions are NOT available for OS X (as specified in the OP). Am I missing something? <comment292131> @fearless_fool It worked for me when I wrote this answer. I think what I did was the instructions directly after `4.2.1.1. Installation` at https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html#additions-windows, where it says `On Mac OS X hosts, you can find this file in the application bundle of VirtualBox. (Right click on the VirtualBox icon in Finder and choose Show Package Contents. There it is located in the Contents/MacOS folder.)` http://i.stack.imgur.com/Obz5K.png <comment292132> Bingo!  And there it is.  Thank you for the enlightenment. <comment359433> It was a simple menu command for me: When running the VM, select `Devices`-`Insert Guest Additions CD Image`. This popped up a prompt in my VM to install them.
