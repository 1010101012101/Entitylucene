How can I fix NXDOMAIN error? <body> I have recently moved my blog to another hosting company. The problem is that I cannot access my blog from my macbook pro although at the same time I can see it from my sony vaio. Going at the terminal and running : nslookup blog.myblogname.org I get the following results:  Server: xx.xx.x.xxx Address: xx.xx.x.xxx#53  ** server can't find blog.myblogname.org: NXDOMAIN  (Server is my isp's domain name server)  Any ideas how to fix that error so that I am able to access my blog from my macbook pro? Thank you!  PS : My operating system is MAC OS 10.7.4   <answer54500> Try using codedscacheutil -flushcache/code in the terminal on the Mac.  <answer292687> In my case, the error was showing up when I tried to access my Blogger site via the Indian domain (blogspot.in). Accessing it via the blogspot.com domain made the error go away.  <comment62425> I just tried it but I still cannot access my blog.Thank you for your answer anyway. <comment62426> Perhaps your dns server has the NXDOMAIN still in the cache. Check if you can resolve the IP by using: "host blog.myblogname.org 8.8.8.8" If so, don't worry, NXDOMAIN isn't cached for very long anyway in most cases. <comment62427> I tried your host command (8.8.8.8 is google dns?) and I get the following result - Host blog.myblogname.org not found: 3(NXDOMAIN) <comment62430> I don't know if that matters, but I connect my macbook pro wirelessly to an airport express (that is connected to the router) and the sony vaio wirelessly to the router. <comment62438> It seems that it was a matter of time as you say in your second comment! :) Everything works fine suddenly. <comment62782> The problem appeared again! :( <comment62786> Your host command gives another result now : <comment62788> blog.myblogname.org has address xxx.xxx.xx.xx   Host blog.devcanvas.org not found: 3(NXDOMAIN)   Host blog.devcanvas.org not found: 3(NXDOMAIN) <comment62792> Nslookup from dos is using my router and nslookup from mac is using isp dns servers.I don't know if this comment helps.
