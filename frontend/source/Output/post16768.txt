Please guide me.  <answer16770> According to discussions.apple.com you could also have removed the Windows partition with Boot Camp Assistant (located in /Applications/Utilities).  It may be worth trying that just in case not everything was properly cleaned up during your attempts.  After that you can use go to your System Preferences, and select your OS X volume as the startup disk.  <answer16771> When in the boot manager (the one when you press kbd‚å• Option/kbd on startup), click on the arrow (for the Mac OS X partition). The boot priority should then default to the Mac OS X one.  Otherwise, you can try going to the Startup Disk preference pane in System Preferences, and try setting it (by restarting).
