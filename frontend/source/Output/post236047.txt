How do I download to an external hard drive? <body> I have a very large file to download, and I want to download it directly to an external hard drive and not to the download folder on my c: drive. Is there a way I can do this? There only appears to be two options, open or download. I can only find answers here for extracting zip files, not for downloading directly.  <answer236050> You didn't specify which browser you are using, so I assume Safari. Two options come to mind:  ul liRight-click on the file you want to download and download directly to a destination you select/li liOpen Safari Preferences (in the Safari menu) and select a different download destination in the General tab/li /ul  <comment288756> Can you add a screenshot showing the screen with the two options? Also, which browser are you using, which OS X version? <comment288761> Also, Macs don't have a C: drive... are you actually on a Mac?
