Is there an easy way in Mavericks to share a PDF file directly from Safari into iBooks? <body> Safari loads and displays .PDF files nicely. iBooks is Apple's PDF reader app for sync'd and offline access. To move files currently, I have to:  ol liright-click in Safari to open the PDF in Preview; /li liuse Preview File menu to Move PDF file to Desktop (or anywhere more accessible than Preview's private store); /li liOpen iBooks and drag the PDF file into iBooks./li /ol  Not hard, but a bit cumbersome for something I want to do fairly often. I could probably set up something with Automator / AppleScript, but is there an easier way given a factory install? Am I missing something obvious?  <answer129157> Yes, there is a simpler way. Right-mouse click (or control-click) on the .pdf and Open With iBooks:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oiYcr.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment151175> That's once the file is available in Finder? So that's equivalent to my step#3: two clicks instead of a click and a drag. <comment151177> Yah. Actually, once the file is in a directory, it just a click - slide - release to get into iBooks. Easy-peasy. <comment151180> OK, arguably marginally quicker than click & drag, but there's still steps #1 & #2. Not seeing that this is materially more efficient than the process I outlined..
