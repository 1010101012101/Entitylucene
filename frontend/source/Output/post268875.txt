What's a command-line editor that follows Mac conventions? <body> I'm looking for a Mac command-line editor that follows Mac conventions, like kbdCmd/kbd+kbdS/kbd for save, kbdCmd/kbd+kbdX/kbd for cut, kbdCmd/kbd+kbdC/kbd for copy, kbdCmd/kbd+kbdF/kbd for find, and so on.  This is for use with Mercurial. When I type codehg commit/code, it opens vim, which doesn't use standard shortcuts, so I'm looking for an alternative that does.  <comment337690> To go with Cmd-X/C you usually need to highlight things with the mouse, something CL tools don't really do. The "easy" command-line editor is `nano`, or you could just have Git, Mercurial, etc. launch GUI tools: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3539594/change-the-default-editor-for-files-opened-in-the-terminal-e-g-set-it-to-text <comment337693> In that case, let's ignore Cmd-X and C, and focus on other shortcuts like Cmd-S and -F, which shouldn't require a mouse. <comment338153> I would suggest either learning a command line editor (a valuable skill) or just using a GUI editor.
