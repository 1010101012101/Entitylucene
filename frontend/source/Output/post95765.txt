How to restore deleted applications on system preferences using pref setter? <body> some of my mac 10.5 system preferences items such as, General, desktop and screen saver, sound, dock, display, users and group, bluetooth, start up desk, speech, and time machine are all gone. I can't find it in the TRASH bin and i can't even edit the trash because the side bar has gone also. Can you please help me to restore them? I think i have accidentally deleted it using "secure empty trash".. but some files were not deleted because master server is locked and i cannot find the option to edit it. I've download Pref Setter but i don't know how to use it. I'm afraid i might corrupt all the files on my mac. Can you please explain me how to to use pref setter? or how to restore all deleted items. Your response is highly appreciated. Thank you  <comment112384> My friend gave me this macbook but he forgot to empty the trash bin. So, i cleaned it up using "secure empty trash". I've also changed the mac user's name but the Home Folder is still the previous owner. I couldn't edit it because the Users and Group item/application in the system preferences was gone and i don't know how to restore them. i'm not familiar with mac OSX. <comment112414> If you just got this machine, you might consider reinstalling OS X so the software is restored to "like new" condition.
