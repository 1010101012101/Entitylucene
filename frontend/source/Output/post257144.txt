After upgrade to macOS Sierra secd is using 98% power and cannot be force quit in Activity Monitor <body> Fan has ran for 3 days after upgrading my MacBook Air (mid 2011).   <answer257708> To fix this go to the iCloud settings panel and start the process to enable iCloud Keychain, enter a password, but cancel before completing.  <comment321035> Can you post any logs? If Console.app is acting up the `log stream` command may work... <comment321815> Also agreed, this upgrade was a mistake for my 2011 MacbookAir, running between 94-98%. Fans running contantly now.... <comment322030> See @klanomoath answer. <comment322783> I don't understand this. Enter password where? Before completing what? <comment323707> I finally solved the problem by starting "Keychain Access", selecting "Preferences..." and clicking "Reset My Default Keychain".  After rebooting secd was no longer taking significant CPU.
