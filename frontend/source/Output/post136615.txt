External HD has disappeared from Finder <body> I believe I created this problem. When I plugged my External HD in last week I accidentally dragged the Ext HD onto the desktop. It then disappeared from view in finder and there is no shortcut on the desktop or anywhere that I can find on my computer.   It does however show up in disk utility and when I unplug it, I receive the "inproperly ejected disk" message.   Does anyone know how I can make the Ext HD accessible again?   <answer136617> You have only removed the visibility on your desktop.  ul liGo to Finder (The smiling blue man in your Dock in the lower part of your screen)/li liThen press kbdCommand/kbdkbd,/kbd or go to Finder (menubar) and choose 'Preferences'/li liNow choose 'General'/li liTick the checkbox that says "External Drives"/li /ul  You can do the same for the Finder Sidebar  ul liWithin the Finder Preferences choose 'Sidebar'/li liTick the checkboxes in the Devises section of the devices you want to see/li /ul  Somewhere within the evolution of Finder they added this option, I am almost certain is wasn't added yet in OS 6 ;) With this feature they created a cleaner desktop and some confusion, I must admit.   Another easy way to check which drive is mounted is to open "Disk Utility" located in Applications/Utilities/  Good luck with your drive.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/42RR4.png" alt="Finder prefs"  <comment162098> Is it broken? Or is it visible on another computer, <comment162100> Use Disk Utility <comment162101> This was a perfect answer, extremely well written. Thank you! Solved the problem easily. Unfortunately I cannot upvote yet, but again all my thanks it was driving me nutty. <comment162102> I think he just hid the drive. <comment162103> You can always upvote me later ;)
