What Window Management Options exist for OS X? <body> I'd like to do strongsomething/strong with my windows on OS X, where strongsomething/strong includes options like re-arranging, moving, re-sizing, remembering positions, cloning across Spaces, etc. What options exist?  h3Rules/h3  ul listrongOne/strong app per answer./li liUse this format for the first two lines of your answer:br strongcode## [app name](link to website)/code/strongbr strongcode[App Store](link to appstore) (price)/code/strong   /li listrongCheck for duplicates/strong before adding new answers. /li liIf you find a duplicate, vote it down and encourage its poster to upvote the original entry instead (and remove the dupe)./li liInclude short strongdescription/strong about what this Window Managing app does. ul liWhat makes this Window Manager app different than the others?/li liIs it focused on re-sizing using only the keyboard?/li liIs it focused on moving using only mouse gestures?/li liEtc./li /ul/li /ul  <answer9660> h2SizeUp ($13) by Irradiated Software/h2     SizeUp allows you to quickly position   a window to fill exactly half the   screen (splitscreen), a quarter of the   screen (quadrant), full screen, or   centered via the menu bar or   configurable system-wide shortcuts   (hotkeys). Similar to "tiled windows"   functionality available on other   operating systems   Much of the arranging options provided by SizeUp are available for free in ShiftIt. However, SizeUp does have some additional functionality that may be worth the $  Unique to SizeUp: It allows placement of a window at exact screen coordinates, X,Y, Width, and Height  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4DzWn.gif" alt="enter image description here"  <answer9661> h2ShiftIt (free)/h2  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Iy1D6.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Provides keyboard shortcuts for arranging windows into the four quadrants of the screen, or filling any of the four halves (top, bottom, left, right), or centering a window.  <answer9663> h2Arrange ($8.99)/h2  Rearranges and resizes windows both with keyboard shortcuts, by selecting a predefined (grid-based) or freeform position/arrangement from an overlay hud-style window with the mouse, or by moving the window to active zones on the screen edges.br Each option supports multiple monitor configuration.

This lets you easily maximize your windows, position them side by side or even resize them to quarters of the screen.

Why have 6 shortcuts when you can have 2? As an extra, it also features an app switcher. Just call it up and switch to any open app by typing a single character key (letter or number). <comment137692> The author of Slate seems to have stopped maintaining it.

Sorry to hear it stopped working. <comment140876> thanks, it's not broken (as in doesn't launch) but the window behavior for multiple monitors is giving me trouble. Divvy wasn't the only thing that broke though and it might be my own fault for how customized my Mac environment is. <comment140908> There's a preference in Divvy to "press a shortcut twice to cycle to secondary monitor". I have shortcuts for fullscreen and some other frequent positions, when I have a second monitor I just mash the combination twice. Try enabling that and give it a try. http://i.stack.imgur.com/zXoJo.png <comment140924> Just tried Moom, doesn't seem to work very well :( some apps work for snapping, while others just don't work at all :( <comment142163> Unfortunately, I had troubles when using multiple monitors that were on a different _sides_ of the Macbook. I.e. at Home I have an external display on the left side, while at work I have it on the right of the Macbook. To make things more confusing for Stay, I also use the same monitor manufacturer/model so it gets confused sometimes. <comment148713> Is there an app out there which can *stick* windows over all other applications? I know Afloat, but it doesn't work we'll in all cases. Maybe someone know a "better" solution?! <comment149412> Slate is brilliant. Unfortunately, as Adam notes, it's unmaintained and it even performs quite badly on my setup; Retina MBP + 27" Dell monitor. <comment149567> @duozmo I know I'm very late to the party with this answer, but you can resize from every corner and it doesn't seem choppy to me at all. It might have been difference in 2012, I don't recall. :) <comment149609> It's a subtle distinction. In Linux-style alt-dragging, alt-dragging in, for example, the upper-left quadrant of the window would change the coordinates of the upper left corner ([demo](http://youtu.be/lQJiOvyya30?t=2m25s)), whereas in Flexiglass it changes the lower right corner. <comment149616> @duozmo Ah, you're right. I've never used that feature. And that does, indeed, seem a little choppy. <comment152682> @JasonSalaz how is Divvy working with Mavericks these days? It's been a few months since your comment. <comment152683> For me, the killer feature of BetterSnapTool is the ability to define custom window sizes and link them all to keyboard shortcuts. <comment152769> I couldn't tell you if it's updated or not, but it's worked the same as the day that I first used it. Perfectly well. It suits my transition from built-in display, to thunderbolt display, and even multi display. The "press twice to cycle" feature is really amazingly good. I still love it and put it to use constantly. <comment162253> Thanks for that.  Lots of web searches turned up the other options listed below, but this was the first time I'd heard Spectacle mentioned, and it is exactly what I was looking for. <comment162724> I can finally maximize windows now with the ``Cmd + Alt + F`` 3 Thank you <comment166954> Flexiglass has been great for me. Simple, without a bunch of features I don't need.  Fast: no silly animations or whatever.  It just pops windows where they're needed without fuss. <comment167383> It is now $1.99 <comment168684> @LuceGoose working perfectly here. (double display setup) <comment170015> it doesnt play well with multiple monitors, and the areas are only activated when the CURSOR touches the area, not the window. very annoying. also, no support. <comment170693> Great app but it doesn't seem to know about the applications running on the machine and only can identify by title, so doesn't work well for Chrome browser, for example.  There is a means of specifying a regular expression to match the title which is fine for geeks (like me) but kind of wonky.  Also, I agree with @SinišaŠašić about multiple locations issue; I have the same issue.  It would be nice to be able to name the configurations, e.g. "Work" and "Home".  But it's a lifesaver overall and I strongly recommend it. <comment171019> if you don't wana spend money for a window manager try out the applescript there are plenty of them on the internet just google "applescript moving OR organize windows" <comment179598> The app can also be tested before buying, directly from thier home page, http://www.irradiatedsoftware.com/cinch/ That's what I'm doing right now. <comment181534> And now the price has been lowered to $7! <comment189680> Note to anyone looking to use this with a 4k display.. it's pretty much useless.. you can only move windows between 1/2's and 1/3's of the whole screen.. so if you want to put 6-7 terminals side by side.. this wont help <comment190398> This is the application I've been looking for! Thank you for posting it. I came for the hover-moving and resizing, but I'm staying for the magnetism. <comment191658> After testing a few, this one is the easiest and offer the best features for free. I use it combined with Afloat to have floating windows and windows on all spaces. I'm using it on latest Yosemite. <comment201360> ... and if offer a straightforward key shortcut customization panel. Tried. Approved. <comment207569> @TomHarrisonJr You can set a custom name on a stored layout by double clicking on the name. "Home" and "Work" work pretty nice :) <comment208158> Amending my comment; turns out you can identify an application such as Chrome using the "Link Active Window To..." option.  This solved the issue I reported in cases where it wasn't always working.  Great app. <comment215534> @SimoneGianni Great to know you liked it and thanks for the good word. Please continue telling people about it. <comment215961> I love the simplicity. I need nothing more. Haven't tried the others. They appear to give me what I wasn't looking for in the first place. I just needed full, left, right, fill. Sticker is doing just that. Nice! <comment228425> BetterSnapTool has some serious issues with Yosemite. My multitouch scrolling slows down after a day or so, which is immediately fixed by closing and opening BetterSnapTool. I just switched to Spectacle. <comment248426> Too bad it can't handle custom window size/location combos. I like having some of my windows in specific positions with specific sizes. (Other than that appears to work well, I particularly liked the fact that the run on login option is not set by default.) <comment266911> If you think the comparison between OS X's default window manager and Windows is bad, OS X's looks *far* worse compared to *nix window managers.  What, there's not even a way to push a window to the back, only the front?  Seriously? <comment266913> Well, no, Windows window management it pretty bad compared to the unix/linux set.   Want to have your WM push a window to the back, or type in a window while *keeping* it in the back, or track the day/night cycle in its menu colors, use radial menus, auto-create menus for all the hosts you SSH to, tile, not tile, use window groups, default windows of a certain types or titles of any of your virtual displays, pan your monitor to arbitrary overlaps with your virtual screens, manage window on a different *computer*, etc, etc.  Unix/Linux/X - it's all there. <comment272716> Too bad it's not supporting mouse for taking actions. You can not drag the title bar to the side you want to get the window fit to half-left, half-right, fullscreen by dragging it on the left, right and top of the screen respectively. <comment273310> I still use Divvy. It's incredibly simple. Setup the hotkeys such that window resizing works the same as it would on a windows machine (Windows + Left = left 50%, Windows + Right = right 50%). <comment284847> Thanks for `Spectacle`! @xryl669, I also noticed this big difference in comparison to others, it lacks hot corners and hot sides, when controlling mouse only. You may check **[iSnap](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/232898/173703)**, which has the same functionality as Spectacle + **hot corners**. I've been using  this iSnap.app for two years so far, and it's FREE as well. It's lightweight and tiny as well,  500Kb. <comment284852> I tried to use **Sticker** + **[Spectacle](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/66936/173703)** apps - and these work like a charm together! Sticker has *mouse snapping*, and does it really nice, spectacle does *keyboard shortcuts* excellently. If someone needs not that rich snapping + keyboard shortcuts, almost the same functionality, there is tiny **[iSnap](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/232898/173703)** utility, which mixes features of those two and has 500Kb size of the app. <comment285015> I'm using [Sticker](http://www.chompstomp.com/). Works well, free and simple. <comment286903> You can't hide the icon that it adds to the menubar, adding yet another usless application up there. Also it refuses to open and says to "Enable access for assistive devices and try again". But there is no such thing in System Preferences anymore. <comment286952> @xApple, you are right, but consider the point, that this utility is *tiny*, ~0.3Mb. It would be too much to expect an advanced feature list here. I'm not forcing anyone to use it, I just shared what I've been using for 1.5 years. It simply does the job, not more, not less. *iShake* - appeared useless utility for me as well, I disabled it from the very beginning... <comment289245> arrows doesnt work on os x 10.11.4 <comment310769> Don't want to reboot a post, but doing it anyway. But it seems this app has presets, so with one click set all window sizes. Is that correct or should every window be set manually, one  at a time? <comment321885> spectacler app, made my day <comment348829> HazeOver is a great idea, and is well-implemented (I got it through the Setapp subscription service).  I especially like the multi-monitor support.  This means I can have, for example, an editor window highlighted on my main screen, and at the same time a window of a different app (such as Preview or Safari) highlighted on my secondary screen.  It complements rather than replaces the need for window management though, so I recommend combining it with another app, such as Moom. <comment354304> This appears to be unmaintained. No updates in about a year as of my comment; doesn't appear to be any maintained / primary fork, either. <comment354305> Moom (above) does basically everything both ShiftIt and Divvy do, combined; and it's cheaper, to boot. Check it out as a replacement, now. <comment356265> I've been using this for about 6months and it's reliable, lightweight and exactly what I was looking for. <comment362254> I don't like full-screen mode - too much empty space - and I love being able to switch easily between apps or windows, so HazeOver has been perfect for me: background windows become less distracting but remain easily accessible.
