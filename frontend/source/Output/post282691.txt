tmux jump words as with zsh <body> I moved from just using zsh to using zsh inside tmux. As my terminal is iTerm2 for both combinations.  I have the following lines in my code.zshrc/code to enable jumping words on a bare zsh command line using the ALT+arrow keys:  precodebindkey '[C' forward-word bindkey '[D' backward-word /code/pre  Sadly this is not working inside my tmux session.     How can I jump words back and forth also in tmux using ALT + arrow   key?   What I tried so far:  ol licodeset-window-option -g xterm-keys on/code 1/li /ol  <answer294680> If found the solution here https://superuser.com/questions/427163/altarrow-moving-between-words-in-zsh-and-iterm2  You have to adjust the keybindings for ⌥ ← and ⌥→ inside iTerm2
