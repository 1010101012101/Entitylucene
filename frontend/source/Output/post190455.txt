Issues when playing through bluetooth speaker (youtube mutes) <body> 1) I listen to iTunes via Archt One BT speaker  2) I pause iTunes, try to play youtube video and there is no sound  3) while youtube stil playing "muted", I then play iTunes again and both can be heard  4) this doesn't happen with Swinsian (alternative to iTunes)  I'm on Mavericks.   Any solution? Is it just an iTunes/OSX bug? I think it's not related to that particular BT speaker although it's with it that I experience this for the first time.. I don't remember if I used Swinsian or already back to iTunes when testing the previous speaker.  Thank you for any hints...  <answer255205> Play both through iTunes and YouTube so you can hear both and then press the play/pause button on your keypad. this should pause the iTunes music but still play the YouTube video sound. Then you can exit the iTunes app.  Hope it Helps!
