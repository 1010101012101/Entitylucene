Yosemite Grey Screen with 3d Party SSD not a trim issue <body> I have a MacBook 7,1 which i recently installed a PNY 250 SSD and added some RAM. The laptop was running awesome with OSX 10.6.8, lightning fast.   Then I installed Yosemite. There was a bit of hang during the install, but Yosemite came up no issue when I rebooted. Here is the problem:  Every other time I boot the MacBook it hangs at a grey screen with the prohibitory sign. Verbose reveals a "still waiting for root device" error. Now if I reboot from that hang, it boots fine, but then will hang again the next time. It keeps alternating like this. Any ideas??  I am not running any third party trim software, so that's not the issue.  <answer158630> try resetting your PRAM and SMC, this may resolve your issue,   http://osxdaily.com/2010/11/15/reset-pram-mac/  http://osxdaily.com/2010/03/24/when-and-how-to-reset-your-mac-system-management-controller-smc/  otherwise it could be bad RAM... take your Macbook in to apple and have them test the RAM.  <comment186391> if it were an HD, I'd say it's not spinning up quickly enoughâ€¦ so I'm stumped <comment186400> All I can think off is: Apple has tighten the non apple hardware check in Yosemite (including the SSD). It is called the kext signing. http://www.cindori.org/trim-enabler-and-yosemite/  I know you have not enabled trim but ? If you can provide us with Console log of the boot process.
