How do I restore lost Garageband instruments? <body> I opened Garageband after a long time and noticed that all my instruments are lost. The .exs and sampler files are still where they are supposed to be: code/Library/Application Support/Garageband/Instrument Library/code but Garageband isn't detecting them. I can't afford to download 6 GB's worth of instruments.   How do I make Garageband detect them?  I also have Logic Pro installed.
