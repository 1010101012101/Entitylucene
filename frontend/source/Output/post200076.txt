Terminal: grep command usage with '[' character as target, not function <body> Im using the codegrep/code command In a simple script, the problem however Is that the string which the grep command Is searching for includes a square bracket character: code[/code.  After some research, i have found that the square bracket code[/code character is in fact used as a function for optimising the grep commands output through a process called "codepipelining/code" (Although don't quote me on It as Im not sure).  My Question:  strongHow do I search for a string with a '[' character in it without invoking a pipelining function within grep?/strong  Elaboration:  The script Is searching a system log for the string codesu[/code. This Is my current malfunctioning command: codetail -1 system.log | grep " su["/code, however It will not work due to the square bracket at the end, returning the error: codegrep: brackets ([ ]) not balanced/code.  Thanks In Advance.  <answer200080> Brackets should be escaped with code\/code, because it's a special character. Your command will look like:  precodetail -1 system.log | grep " su\[" /code/pre  h2Special characters/h2  From this site You can learn about special characters in bash.     What makes a character special? If it has a meaning beyond its literal meaning, a meta-meaning, then we refer to it as a special character. Along with commands and keywords, special characters are building blocks of Bash scripts.   code\/code is a special character and it could be used as:     strong[ ]/strong   test.      Test expression between [ ].  Note that [ is part of the shell builtin test (and a synonym for it), not a link to the external command /usr/bin/test.      strong[[ ]]/strong   test.      Test expression between [[ ]]. More flexible than the single-bracket [ ] test, this is a shell keyword.      strong[ ]/strong   array element.      In the context of an array, brackets set off the numbering of each element of that array.   codeArray[1]=slot_1/code      codeecho ${Array[1]}/code      strong[ ]/strong   range of characters.      As part of a regular expression, brackets delineate a range of characters to match.      strong$[ ... ]/strong   integer expansion.      Evaluate integer expression between $[ ].   <comment241072> escape `[` with `\ `. It'll look like: `grep " su\["`. <comment241074> @Mateusz Szlosek, Add it as an answer, with explanation of why special characters need to be escaped. <comment241212> Yeah this worked with a simple modification ( tail -1 system.log | grep " su\\\[" ), necessitating an extra backslash (\\) for some reason to work properly, however you were on the right track, thank you.
