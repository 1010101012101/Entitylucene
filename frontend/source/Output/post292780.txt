Is there a way to toggle startup sounds on a 2017 MacBook Pro? <body> I've been a Mac user for a while, and I was really upset about the removal of the startup sounds in the new MacBooks post-2016. I was wondering if there was a way to turn the startup sound back on, or even edit the startup procedure to play a sound file. I currently am using a 2017 MacBook Pro 15-inch running macOS 10.12.6.  <answer292796> From terminal, run  precodesudo nvram BootAudio=%01 /code/pre  to change it back, just change 01 to 00 run the command again.
