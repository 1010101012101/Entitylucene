How can I prevent sleep in OSX Recovery mode? <body> I'm doing a disk backup in OSX Recovery Mode and it sleeps.  In sleep mode, the backup stops dead.  Hot corners do nothing.  Sleep seems to kick in after 30 seconds - unsupportable for backing up 850 GB over USB 2.0 (sigh).  I found articles about OSX's "caffeinate" command, but it's too late - I'm 1/3 through the backup.  Can't I keep my Mac running while it's doing this actual intended important work in Recovery Mode?  <answer257597> If you're already in Recovery Mode doing some operation you don't want to interrupt, you can try this trick to run codecaffeinate/code.  Go to the Wi-Fi icon on the menu bar and pull it down.  Select "Join Other Network..."  The "Find and join a Wi-Fi network" dialog will be there, but look at the application title.  It's "macOS Utilities." Go to the Utilities menu and select "Terminal".  In the terminal, issue the command codecaffeinate/code.  When your operation is done, control-C out of it.  If it bothers you that the display sleeps and you don't really trust that the operation is still going, you can issue a stronger version:  codecaffeinate -dismut 65500/code  This is sort of like 'sleeplessness with prejudice.'  With the -u flag you get an implicit -t 5, which stops caffeine after five seconds.  So I overrode this by adding '-t 65500' which makes the caffeinate command last about 18 hours.  Finally, because I'm really, REALLY paranoid, I actually put caffeinate in the background and run a shell loop with ps -ef running every 75 seconds.
