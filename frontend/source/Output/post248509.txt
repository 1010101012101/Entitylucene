How to Handle two people with same name in Apple Photos? <body> I am sorting my photos in the Apple Photos app via Faces, and have two contacts with identical names. Is there any way to create two "faces" with identical names, or do I need to change one of their names?  <comment307938> I would put their last initial or full last name. <comment307961> They have same first and last name. <comment307972> then they are the same person. <comment307977> I don't know how Photos lets you use middle initials, but did you try adding M.I. (granted they don't have the same M.I. - in which case, you can use M.I. for one, and not for another)? Just an idea, please ignore if that's not allowed by Photos.
