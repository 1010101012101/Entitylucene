Reliable instruction on installing Ubuntu on Macbook Pro <body> There are some walk-through kind of instruction on installing Ubuntu on Macbook Pro (as dual boot OS along with Mac OS X), such as Lifehacker's post.  But they are either too old that I worry if the particular details are still currently applicable, or the source is not particularly reliable.  Any pointer to a good, reliable, and current source on this?  I intend to install Ubuntu as a dual boot OS on my Macbook Pro (mid 2011 model).  <answer137454> I think this following link will help you : https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MactelSupportTeam/AppleIntelInstallation#Detailed_How-To  Here they have explained it cery clearly::   http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2011/10/dual-boot-os-ubuntu  Hope this will help you.
