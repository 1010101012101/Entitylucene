Voice command to output "\ref{}" in Dragon Dictate 4 <body> I want to define a voice command that outputs "\ref{}" in Dragon Dictate 4. When I define the following voice command:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8rlBf.png" alt="enter image description here"  the output is:  precode[blank line] ef{} /code/pre  Basically code\r/code is interpreted as a carriage return. How can I escape this? I would prefer a solution that works as the text macro (it should be easy to do it in Automator as a last resort otherwise).  I tried writing code\\ref{}/code as escape character but it didn't work, I get the following:  precode\ [blank line] ef{} /code/pre
