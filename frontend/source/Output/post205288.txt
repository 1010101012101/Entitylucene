Yahoo is taking over my Google search from my Safari on my Mac <body> In Safari Preferences, emGoogle/em is my Default Search Engine; New Windows and New Tabs are set to emHomepage/em.   However, recently whenever I Google something, I click on my choice and I end up on Yahoo Search.  Sometimes I get codesearch.epolife.com/code.  This is very frustrating, I do not want to go to a new search of Yahoo, I like my Google. How can I regain control of Safari?  <answer205292> I found my answer in this YouTube video: how to get rid of searchbar redirect in safari.  In Safari's Preferences, select strongExtensions/strong.  There was the epolife. I strongdeleted the epolife extension/strong, quit and relaunched Safari and came back in. After that I no longer have this problem.  <answer231502> The video above worked!  I did the following: click safari next to the apple at top of screen click preferences click extensions "epolife" was the one I had - with "epolife" enabled, I clicked "uninstall"  THANK GOD!!  <comment247561> Mark it as solved. :)
