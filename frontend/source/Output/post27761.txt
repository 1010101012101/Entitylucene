What tiny thing in iOS 5 makes you smile, or has caught you off guard? <body> iOS 5 is here! Geofencing, new Voices in Voice Command/Siri, and Notification Center for all!  We all know how heartfelt iOS makes you seem (Cards), how much control it gives you for managing your network (Airport Utility), and how it will easily turn you into a stalker (Find Your Friends), strongbut what about all the day-in and day-out things that truely make the upgrade process worth it?/strong  Please post only one tip per answer, and strongcheck to see if your answer has already been posted - duplicate answers will be deleted/strong. To search answers for this question use codeinquestion:27761/code (or codeinquestion:this/code, while viewing this question specifically) in addition to your search terms in the search box in the upper right hand corner of this page.  <answer27762> h2Swipe Camera to view Photo Roll/h2  When codeCamera.app/code is open, and you want to quickly view your previously taken photos instead, don't hit the photo button in the bottom left, simply swipe the screen from left-to-right and you will go in descending date-taken order through your Camera Roll.  Note that you cannot do this if your phone is locked and you used the 'quick camera' method, except for photos taken in that session.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zhFvF.png" width="200"  This screenshot was taken mid-swipe (which is rather difficult to do). Note the codeCamera.app/code interface on the right half, and a familiar partial screenshot on the left.  <answer27763> h212 Hour, Hour-by-Hour forecast/h2  When viewing codeWeather.app/code, simply tapping on the screen/6 day forecast will slide the days downward, and reveal a 12 hour, hour-by-hour forecast!  Note also that "Hourly" illuminates underneath the city name when in this mode.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wjduG.png" width="200" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rb3Jw.png" width="200"  <answer27764> h26 day forecast in Weather Widget for Notification Center/h2  When in the Notification Center drawer, you can swipe the Current Weather widget in either direction to switch between Current Local Conditions, to the same 6 day forecast you would see in codeWeather.app/code. Saves a ton of time!  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6NUlu.jpg" width="200" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Q652X.jpg" width="200" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tEvrt.jpg" width="200"  <answer27765> h2Ringtones (can) Serve Double Duty as Notification Tones/h2  Ringtones that are less than 15 seconds will also show up in the the various other notification types.   New (SMS) Message, Calendar Alerts, Tweet Sent, etc. They can even be defined as the SMS tone for a specific contact in your Address Book.  <answer27766> h2Maps.app now features alternate routes/h2  When getting directions that encompass a long distance that may have multiple highway routes, you will be able to choose 'Route 1' or 'Route 2' after searching the addresses, and before hitting start. Tapping on the 'Route 1'/'Route 2' tooltips will change the color for that route (light blue/dark blue) and also update the estimated distance and time in the header bar.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wfoDn.png" width="200" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XXcu4.png" width="200"  <answer27768> h2Usage shows how much space each app is using/h2  h3Settings - General - Usage/h3  iOS 5 now collects the space used by apps and the data in the app - sorted by the largest size. If you need to free up some space quickly, this is a great way to easily identify and remove the largest burdens on your storage space.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4dVdH.png" width="200"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3ciu7.png" width="200"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OVzRM.png" width="200"  emOf specific strongtiny/strong note, the edit button in the top right allows you to delete selective content from apps like Music./em  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pjufi.jpg" width="200"  <answer27769> h2Emoji for everybody!/h2  Emoji is now a keyboard that can be used by anybody, where prior to iOS 5 it would only be enabled by the use of a Softbank (Japanese Cell Phone Carrier) SIM card in your device, or via special tricks that certain applications would perform.  Enable it by going into Settings - General - Keyboard - International Keyboards - Add New Keyboard, then scroll about 1/3rd of the way down and tap 'Emoji'.  Emoji are cute little detailed picture icons. These icons can only generally be seen on Apple computers, iPhone users, or most Japanese Cell Phones (albeit they will look quite a bit different on those).    <answer27770> h2Additional "Clear Skies at Night" Icons in Weather.app/h2  When in 12 hour forecast mode, or when it is the night time, there are new icons in the forecast area that resemble a starry sky, as opposed to a daytime sun, indicating clear weather.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wjduG.png" width="200" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rb3Jw.png" width="200"  <answer27772> h2You can send and receive iPhone FaceTime calls via email addresses/h2  This is nothing new to iPod touch or iPad users, but up until iOS 5 iPhone users could only send or receive FaceTime calls with their phone number. Now you can add one or more email addresses to the FaceTime section in Settings to enable people to FaceTime you at those addresses. You can also configure the Caller ID to be either the phone number or any of the email addresses - useful to prevent people you FaceTime with from getting your phone number.  You also have the same flexibility with iMessage as well, the ability to send and receive messages from either your phone number of any number of email addresses.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7oDq9.png" width="200" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FzhSP.png" width="200"  <answer27773> h2Third Party Audio Apps Can Publish Song Data to Lock Screen / Multitasking Bar/h2  In previous versions of iOS, the lock screen and multitasking bar would simply show the app name that's playing music. But now, if supported in the app/implemented by the developer, full Artist, Album, and Title information can be shown instead.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cdxCc.png" width="200" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/enteA.png" width="200"  Note the non-Music.app icon in the multitasking bar.  <answer27808> h2Bluetooth Volume Control, and Bluetooth Text Display/h2  Simply that the volume control on my stereo bluetooth headphones now actually controls the volume of my iPod Touch - AND the currently playing track is displayed on the Bluetooth module. Looks like they've sorted that one good and proper!  <answer27812> h2Rename Your iOS Device/h2  I can change my iPod's name without using a computer.   Silly I know, but I can.  codeSettings.app &gt; General &gt; About &gt; Name/code  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6ly4q.png" width="200" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rEjPr.png" width="200" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lRMoY.png" width="200"  <answer27835> h2Siri can be activated at the lock screen without a passcode/h2  You can use Siri to call, text, and email from the lock screen strongwithout a passcode/strong.  Didn't make me smile, but caught me off guard.  Luckily, you can disable Siri at the lock screen by going to Settings- General- Passcode Lock turning the Siri switch to Off.  <answer27870> h2Pause a Timer/h2  I really like the pause button for timers in Clocks.app. A tiny little thing, but so much nicer than having to change the timer to the nearest minute, and restart.  <answer27873> h2Retractable Keyboard in Messages.app/h2  The neat way that you can scroll down on iMessages and it pulls the keyboard down with your finger.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/z0MLb.png" width="200"  <answer27923> h1Swiping right when reading e-mail displays message list in portrait mode on iPad/h1  You no longer have to reach for the top left button to show that list.  If you do not wind up selecting a message, a simple swipe left in the message content pane, not in the folder/message list, will retract it.  <answer27960> h2More convenient "Find On Page" searching/h2  I just noticed that when you're in Safari, and you click in the Search box at the top-right, the keyboard has a new "Find on Page" box, that is much more convenient than the old iOS 4 way of searching.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6jQyO.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongEdit: 20/10/2011/strong  The Pad Gadget page iPad Quick Tip – Find Text and Keywords in Mobile Safari shows a screenshot from the iOS 4 days. Notice how the "On this page" bit appears after it's searched the Web. My point is that the iOS 5 way is more obvious, and more convenient.  <answer27963> h2Ability to edit the colours of Exchange calendars/h2  Finally, I can make the colours of each Exchange calendar consistent, without needing to buy a Mac, to use iCal!  To change the colours:  ol liClick on the strongCalendars/strong button/li liClick on strongEdit/strong/li liClick on the strong"" button/strong next to a calendar/li liPick the Colour of your choice.../li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/odtkl.png" alt="iPad calendar colour-selection dialog"  A nice extra touch is that if you use a 3rd-party calendar app, such as Informant HD, the same colours are used there too.  <answer27972> h2Split keyboard on the iPad/h2  Just pull the keyboard apart with your thumbs. The Hide Keyboard button (bottom right) can now be used to reposition the split keyboard on the screen. It takes some getting used to but it can be handy for typing whilst holding the iPad in your hands.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Trg5M.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer27973> h2Multi-touch gestures on iPad/h2  ol liPinch to close app/li liSwipe up with four fingers to show the app switcher/li liSwipe left/right with four fingers to switch between running apps/li /ol  I'm finding number 3 less useful so far but 1 and 2 are becoming second nature.  <answer28008> h2Dictionary/h2  Word definitions from text selections.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lAlJ5.jpg" width="200" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2l3Zt.jpg" width="200"  <answer28009> h2Keyboard shortcuts/h2  I wanted this for a long time.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/C9J4o.jpg" width="200"  <answer28012> h2MobileSafari, Mobile Reader/h2  The strongReader/strong button in emMobile Safari/em address bar.  It displays a page not entirely suited for mobile in an easy to read, black-and-white format.  It removes all of the extraneous information and focuses on the body text.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FSUJs.png" width="200" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Xm6Ch.png" width="200"  strongEDIT:/strong Something new I noticed recently, if the article has a link such as "Continued on page 2...", the Reader will automatically load the additional pages, allowing you to scroll through the entire article without leaving the Reader.  <answer28013> h2Good Vibrations/h2  Custom vibration patterns!

Settings  General  Accessibility  LED Flash for Alerts  Works best with a transparent or semi transparent cover, ie. they glow with the phone lying flat on a table.  <answer28054> h2Undo Close Tab/h2  In Safari on the iPad, tap and hold the [+] button to display a list of recently closed tabs instead of creating a new empty tab.  <answer28077> h2Find My Friends/h2  For parents of a teenager, this is a great way to track where the kids are.   The ability to remove the app or remove 'friends' can be restricted with parental restrictions. This combo alone is worth getting the kid an iPhone.   "I see you're 1 mile from Home Depot. Please get me a box of 2" drywall screws." Creepy. I know. But we got used to caller ID quick enough.   <answer28101> h2Mass Mark as Read/Unread/Flag/h2  You can now mark multiple emails as Read/Unread from the edit mode in Mail without having to open each message.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DFJR4.png" width="200"/  <answer28119> h2Alternative Shutter Button/h2  I love that you can use the volume up button to take a photo. This is great in landscape mode.  Also if you are using Apple's headphone or any headphone that compatible with iOS, using the volume code+/code button from the headphone also can take a photo for you, this is great for remote shutter !  <answer28125> h2More dash types/h2  Tap and hold the dash on the keyboard now gives an en–dash (in addition to the -hyphen, em—dash and bullet •). Not very useful but it made me smile :–)  <answer28128> h2Additional Data in Calendar when Rotated/h2  Calendar.app when the iPhone is rotated in landscape mode displays a week mode.   Horizontal scroll iterates through days.br Vertical scroll iterates through hours.   <answer28129> h2Draggable Recipients/h2  You can drag and drop recipients between To, Cc and Bcc in Mail app.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JyHGo.jpg" width="200"  <answer28131> h2Read those long song titles and artist/album names/h2  You can tap and hold on a song/podcast title to get a pop-up of the entire description.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gJcpa.png" width="200"  <answer28140> Double tapping the home button on the lock screen shows you both media controls, and a camera icon to the right of the unlock swiping track. Not only is the Camera available from the lock screen, but as soon as you push the home button, it whisks you right back to the lock screen. So nobody can get into your iPhone without unlocking it.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cuDDC.png" width="200"  <answer28142> h2Speak to me (not related to Siri)/h2  One new feature I haven't seen mentioned much is that you can now add a 'Speak' option to every text selection popup, so you can read SMSes or web pages. You can turn it on in the Settings - General - Accessibility.  Works on all devices on all selectable text.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/r99Cm.jpg" width="400"  <answer28161> h2Current Volume Reminder/h2  Switching the phone from Silent mode back to normal now displays the current ringer volume.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZFkPw.png" width="200"/  <answer28198> h2Private Browsing Mode for MobileSafari/h2  MobileSafari now has a private browsing mode, turn it on and off under Settings - Safari.

This was there before, but only showed completed calls, not is shows cancelled calls where you hung up before receiving an answer or voicemail.  Using for proving you tried to call, although it won't show "call failed", it will show cancelled in it's place where a call did actually fail, like for me earlier today...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qoN8n.jpg" width="200"  <answer29192> h2In-app Download Progress Indicators/h2  Podcasts that are downloading are shown in the Music app with a circular completion icon that fills clockwise until the download completes at the 12 o'clock mark.

Want to hit Y with your left finger? Do it, it's there, and it's really wide too, easily 3 buttons wide. Want to hit V with your right finger? Do it, same rules apply.

On Safari on SL, I see only the boxes (as with Chrome) <comment31874> -1 this is not a question that has an answer. It's more of a promotion stunt. http://apple.stackexchange.com/faq#dontask <comment31879> @Philippe the occasional fun question/promotional stunt is OK. this question is for all those little things you'd never know even to ask about in iOS 5 <comment31880> Yes, this is true. Thank you for reminding me. <comment31881> PC-Free is the way to be. Cut the Cord! <comment31882> @VxJasonxV Got that right! Side note: I haven't changed my iPod's name back yet. ;) <comment31883> I suspect that's related to the work for [3rd party apps being able to publish song info](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/27761/what-tiny-thing-in-ios-5-makes-you-smile-or-has-caught-you-off-guard/27773#27773). But I am quite curious, what BT device do you have that has a screen and will display this information? <comment31884> In order: Highly subjective, and that's why it's Community Wiki. -- And just what is wrong with Gushing Excitement? :( -- Again, that's why it's Community Wiki; It's not a promotional stunt, it's a pool of information that may not necessarily have an obvious question asked of it. Do you really think someone is going to ask: "How can I send picture icons to all my Japanese/iPhone-using friends?" <comment31897> +1, useful question! And just what CW is for, in my opinion. <comment31915> +1 because (a) I wish my Android phone had a better OEM lock screen and (b) **Skrillex** <comment31925> It was about time! :) <comment31931> So, as we see here:  This is fun, but beware that sending an email with emoji in it will result in little boxes for the recipient unless he is using iOS or Lion... For example, if he is using Windows. <comment31936> I find these "threads" extremely useful! Most of the time I pick up at least a couple of new things. <comment31941> @GEdgar why would you want to email a Windows user anyway?! :P <comment31943> I'm looking forward to Spotify implementing this :) <comment31947> Oh WOW. That is awesome! I hadn't even been in a position to use that yet! Great obvious addition you'll see as soon as you have to review a previous message in the conversation. Very neat! <comment31967> It's probably worth noting that Windows Phone is probably responsible for this (having done it first) as well as the physical button camera shutter. Competition at work :) <comment31972> E-mailing you at Stack Exchange would mean e-mailing a Windows user :(. <comment31989> But aint siri an iphone 4S feature rather than ios 5 ? <comment32001> This. As small as it seems, I desperately wanted this feature. Big help when your best friend sends you 1500-word rants via text message. :) <comment32002> Yes, but do we really need an *additional* thread called "What tiny thing in iPhone 4S makes you smile, or has caught you off guard?" :) <comment32003> +1 Didn't even realize this feature existed! <comment32052> My car can display the current track.  In the past, it did not display with BlueTooth, but it did display when the iPhone was plugged in with USB.  I guess I haven't payed attention since iOS5 to see if there was a change. <comment32058> Siri is new to iOS 5. Of course, Voice Control has been like this since, like, iOS 3. And the same tip holds true for it. <comment32059> I wonder if Camera+ predates the release of Windows Phone? I honestly can't put a suitable timeline in my head at the moment. <comment32064> Siri is not an iOS 5 feature. <comment32066> @VxJasonxV Siri is new to iPhone 4S. It's not an iOS 5 feature, otherwise it would be available e.g. for iPhone 4's. There just is no iPhone 4s with iOS 4. <comment32091> It kinda sucks but this feature existed for iPad 1 in iOS 4.3. They pulled this out in iOS 5. <comment32103> I enjoy using 1 and 3 (3 is a real time saver), hadn't found 2 yet. <comment32104> It also "undocks", press and hold the keyboard button. <comment32105> It's not just text editing apps. It also works on most apps that display text and let you select it such as Safari or the web browser component. <comment32107> I've updated the answer to put this more clearly, I hurried to get the thing posted with the pics and didn't think about wording properly. <comment32110> iPad-only, unfortunately. <comment32119> Technically it is. It's both an iPhone 4S and an iOS 5 feature. <comment32120> Huh. I never even thought to pull apart the keyboard, I always just used the retraction icon and the "grips" that were added to it. But need that you can just expand it apart! <comment32121> I don't like how you only get this after tapping the search box, however. It makes sense considering the way to do it before, but it doesn't generally make sense. Well, maybe. Different kinds of search :/. <comment32163> I saw Soundcloud doing that in iOS 4. <comment32166> I actually don't like this feature. The moon without clouds is more parallel to the sun. And the first time I saw the stars, I thought it was snow. Which was very confusing, since it's still 84F here. <comment32203> Note that you can use parental controls to enforce this, actively prevent them from changing options. <comment32204> I'm fairly certain you didn't. Apps previously had no way to be able to do that. Because apps couldn't "change their name" in order to show something different in the multitasking bar / lock screen. There was no SDK mechanism like there is now to publish this data. <comment32205> Yay typos. But neat*, that you can just expand it apart. <comment32206> You know, I'll agree with you on that second part, I too thought it said snow, which isn't unreasonable for Colorado in this season :). I still like the stars though. <comment32208> I want to +1 this for the example alone, but Find My iPhone is not a new iOS 5 feature :(. <comment32210> Hmmm. I'd never heard of it prior to this. Thanks. <comment32212> This answer can be changed to the Find my Friends app instead, which is new with iOS 5 and actually better for tracking teenagers anyway. You can mention that the ability to remove the app or remove 'friends' can be restricted with parental restrictions. <comment32216> @KyleCronin - edited, thanks. <comment32219> Why isn't that a majorly advertised feature? I haven't wanted this ever since ever. <comment32263> I was so happy when I saw this. <comment32264> You beat me 5 seconds. <comment32266> There's nothing particuarly special about those characters - they're just Unicode. They show for me in Linux. For example, character #6 is the example is http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/1f4a9/index.htm <comment32267> I've wanted those as well, but I was disappointed that you can't have shortcuts for multiline text. On the Mac, I have shortcuts for valedictions. Having that would save a lot of time on the iPhone. <comment32269> https://twitter.com/#!/spolsky/status/126035293462724608 <comment32273> I tried this, but it's a full flash so it's very bright. <comment32277> But does it have voice directions yet? That's the big thing that keeps my wife from using her phone as a navigator. Seems like it would be a natural fit with Siri... <comment32286> Camera.ipa n'est-ce pas? <comment32288> This is 100% true, but the fact that you can input them easily on an iPhone is relatively special :). I mean, I've been entering Unicode on a phone since my Sidekick 2, but this method is 1098530974298712x easier. <comment32289> I don't entirely understand the question. <comment32295> Note that this does not require a 4S and has nothing to do with Siri. <comment32301> I wonder if `\n` works ;) *(I'll save you 2 mins, it doesn't)* <comment32303> That's very very cool. <comment32330> Looks like snow to me.... <comment32336> What about `\r`? (I am being facetious.) <comment32338> I don't understand this feature. It only shows information that's already visible in the list. Strange. Of its unfinished, doubly strange. <comment32342> @VxJasonxV: Is that a reference to the old commercials that use to say "Drug-free is the way to be" or did I just have a weird deja-vu moment? <comment32343> I was excited to see my colors change since I use Google Sync. Now I'm really excited I can change them on the phone itself :D <comment32344> You should mention the same goes for iMessage too. <comment32345> I remember seeing this as a feature for normal Safari and thinking, meh. But on the iPhone this feature is gold! <comment32346> @cksum: Well kind of. You can see the title of the song was truncated so the popup shows all the song info. <comment32347> WHOA! I have never seen anyone mention this feature before. This is extremely useful for the first couple weeks of each quarter when I need to see my classes for the week. <comment32349> There are a lot of good Accessibility features that no one knows about. <comment32350> Moreover, it now also shows the full title when displaying the currently playing song's cover art using a marquee. It used to chop it off if it was too long before, making it especially useless for podcasts and audiobook with numbers at the *end* of the title. Have been complaining about that since iPhoneOS 1.0 <comment32364> This was clearly inspired by Android, but it looks much nicer on the iOS. <comment32378> OK, I did NOT know that. :D <comment32420> Doesn't appear to work on iPhone, FWIW <comment32425> You just had a weird déjà vu moment. <comment32440> Uh, I don't get it. If I can read the screen and select the words I want, then why do I need to have it read aloud? What's the use case for this? <comment32443> Ignore iCloud, this and the hole + in iPad safari for recently closed tabs, is way more worth the upgrade process. <comment32445> There are a lot of good accessibility features, which should just be normal features. <comment32461> I didn't even know the old Safari had in-page search. This is pretty cool.. <comment32473> Do you know if this is a iOS 5 feature or a 4S feature? My car is supposed to display Bluetooth track info, but still doesn't for my 4 with iOS 5. <comment32479> Unfortunately, none of these work. Maybe in iOS 5.0.1... <comment32527> iPhone 4 or greater only <comment32547> Siri is indeed a feature of iOS 5 but is currently limited to the iPhone 4S. It may appear on the iPad 3. <comment32576> And yet, while soundcloud was playing, I certainly saw soundcloud in the place of ipod icon in the multitasking bar. Not sure about the locked screen, though. <comment32577> It actually was present in iOS 4, I used that before. <comment32581> @Emily - this works on my car radio with an iPhone 4 and iOS 5 <comment32589> This is a long awaited feature! Can't wait for this to be available on the iPhone also. <comment32637> Now if this could only be implemented in the iTunes app. So many podcasts prefix the title of the episode with the podcast name and you can't ever tell what the contents of that episode is. <comment32639> @Bora: true for many iOS 5 features. <comment32640> Is this only available on the iPhone 4S? I don't see it on my iPhone 4. Do I have to enable it somehow? <comment32643> This one is so good and intuitive, I didn't even THINK about mentioning this was new. <comment32644> Oh, sorry, I misunderstood. The icon of the currently playing application is not new, that's been around since the multitasking bar existed (iOS 4); the name of the song is the part that is new. <comment32699> @DanAbramov, and true vica-versa. <comment32700> This isn't iPad-only; you have to start typing text before "Find in Page (n matches)" will show in the bottom of the results. <comment32703> @jessegavin, I have an iPhone 4.  It seems to only appear on certain pages, usually those with a single article.  It doesn't appear if you have a string of blog entries (multiple articles) or a forum listing.  Also you have to wait for the whole page to load first.  Try a news site so you can see it in action. <comment32712> By hold you mean lock, correct? <comment32714> @Josh: yeah. Don't know what's wrong with me.. <comment32723> As with any other editable list, you can also swipe individual items as opposed to tapping edit first. <comment32746> @SteveShaner - That was there before iOS5. <comment32747> @Styfle - "a lot of good Accessibility features that no one knows about" ... ironic that accessibility to the accessibility features is so poor. <comment32759> I appreciate the hand contortion or outside assistance it must have required for you to be able to take this screenshot. <comment32760> No, it wasn't. Before it was only the hyphen and em-dash. The en-dash is new. <comment32767> @slomojo: Hahaha, I didn't even think about that. It's probably "hard to find" because most people aren't looking for it. These are features I didn't even know I wanted. But out of all the menus in iOS 5, Accessibility is the most cluttered. <comment32787> I'm not sure what you mean. If the phone is locked, and you tap the camera button it opens up the camera app. But if you then click the home button is takes you to the home screen, not the lock screen <comment32823> @hopeless That happens to me too, but I think it's a bug. Or maybe it depends on whether you have a pass code set. <comment32834> How does this work? I mean, how can I get those "definitions"? <comment32873> You can enable them on a jailbroken iPad 1 by setting SBUseSystemGestures to true in /var/mobile/Library/Preferences/com.apple.springboard.plist. <comment32895> Just tap the right arrow on the `copy | cut` selected text menu, and there's the `define` option, or tap left to go back. <comment32896> As Steve Yegge skillfully pointed out in his [leaked google+ post](https://plus.google.com/112678702228711889851/posts/eVeouesvaVX), Accessibility is really important, and doesn't really mean what we tend to think it does... Accessibility is every way that humans interact with computers. <comment32906> Hahahhaa. That doesn't seem like a typical Apple thing to do. Some sneaky dev must have put that in there last second. <comment32924> It does not work for me. I get the "copy|cut" button, but there are no arrows. iPhone 4, iOS 5, German. <comment32927> Well heard someone is trying to port Siri to iPhone 4. Can't wait to check it out. <comment32992> You can also delete your Music on device in the same manner. <comment33154> I set the important ones like "On my way" and "I am currently driving" to be 'ooo' and 'ddd' respectively, so I can do it quickly and hopefully safely, like at a light. I like this feature a lot. <comment33158> I'm not so happy to have my private data under someone else's control. But it is a smart business. <comment33160> Truly a typography geek's feature. Makes me happy. :) <comment33302> This is the first thing that struck me when I got my iPhone. It's hard to keep it still when tapping the screen. <comment33534> excellent taste in podcasts :) <comment33543> It's what the last screen is for, all the unremovable stuff. ;) <comment33545> This does indeed apply to anything being downloaded in the music, movies, and a few other apps. <comment34033> Right, presents for the wife...  ;-)  Just teasing! <comment34111> @jesse, It is up to the website developer to “mark” content as an article. Most news websites and blogs already do this, but not all. <comment34757> Gestures are returning to the first iPad in iOS 5.0.1. <comment34919> I love the animation of it. <comment35026> In older versions of iOS, this would only show you "closely related" call times (within maybe a rolling half hour?). That amount of time appears to have been raised dramatically. <comment35027> Pressing the home button takes you to the lock screen with the pin input panel raised if you have a passcode set. <comment35037> If only they would timestamp each SMS too... <comment36712> I have a shortcut that is my e-mail address.  This makes logging in to websites a lot easier, particularly since I have underscores in my e-mail address. <comment36713> iOS 5.0.1 makes this appear on iPad 1 :) <comment36716> This snswer is related to another way of [viewing very long song titles/album titles/artist names](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/27761/what-tiny-thing-in-ios-5-makes-you-smile-or-has-caught-you-off-guard/28131#28131). <comment40742> Sad it works only when editing text (not when reading).. :( <comment41002> Per your edit, that's the whole point of Reader mode. Well, it's one of the main two points. (1) Uniform/Clean Presentation, (2) Single Page <comment44163> Do this mean it animated everywhere on 5.0? Or didn't animate at all? <comment44437> You just made my day. <comment44522> I wasn't aware of that, thanks! <comment44931> And in Lion, too! :D <comment46650> I love this feature. I never use the home button anymore. ;-) <comment51201> Or simply tap the sleep/power button. <comment51241> This feature was new in iOS 5.1, changed from the behaviour in 5.0. <comment51967> @VxJasonxV probably a good idea to change the screenshot to something that doesn't look like an app switching swipe... :) <comment51968> @djacobson - Please expand on how this is done. <comment51969> I had no idea about this one, very nice. <comment53127> On further use this may be a bug as it doesn't seem to always happen (reliably or consistently), or only a partially supported feature.  Trying to get to the bottom of this: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3836857 <comment58866> I was going to command and say "surely you mean right to left" as would be expected with any another app, but after opening Calculator.app I realized that the numbers do come out FROM the right. However, I will note that swiping in either direction (left to right OR right to left) will remove a number. Awesome! <comment62539> Hey, that's pretty neat. Nice find! <comment99849> :-o This is awesome. <comment107269> Use @@ for your email address and ## for your phone number <comment164738> I prefer a @g for @gmail.com etc.
