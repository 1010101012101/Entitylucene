Change the Apache user in httpd.conf on MAMP? <body> I have MAMP installed on OS X. This is the code/Applications/MAMP/conf/apache/httpd.conf/code Apache's configuration section for the user which should run the server:  precode... # # If you wish httpd to run as a different user or group, you must run # httpd as root initially and it will switch. # # User/Group: The name (or #number) of the user/group to run httpd as. # It is usually good practice to create a dedicated user and group for # running httpd, as with most system services. # User me #Group -1 ... /code/pre  As you can see, it is set to codeme/code, which is my user account.  Now, I have created a system user named code_apache/code which I would like to use to run the server, so I change the codehttpd.conf/code to:  precode... # # If you wish httpd to run as a different user or group, you must run # httpd as root initially and it will switch. # # User/Group: The name (or #number) of the user/group to run httpd as. # It is usually good practice to create a dedicated user and group for # running httpd, as with most system services. # User _apache Group _apache ... /code/pre  But if I restart the server, and reopen the codehttpd.conf/code file, I see that MAMP changes the codeUser/code directive back to codeme/code:  precodeUser me /code/pre  Why does it do that? Is this the expected behaviour? Should I somehow tell MAMP that I have intention to run Apache as another user too? How can I do that?  <answer201055> AFAIK MAMP is not intended to run Apache/MySQL as www/mysql. However MAMP Pro allows you to run Apache and MySQL either as your user or as www/mysql. This can be done by selecting the respective users in Preferences - General.  MAMP Pro contains the free MAMP and a free 14-day trial of MAMP Pro.  <comment242370> Thanks for the response! Understood!
