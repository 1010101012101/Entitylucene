Change folder name on launchpad? <body> I'm rearranging my launchpad and I can't seem to figure out how to change the name of one of my folders with the yosemite update.   <answer182996> Simply click the folder, then click the header name, background goes white. Another click will change to an insert point [standard text caret], for finer editing  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5xvl2.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment218022> im trying that and it doesnt seem to work? <comment218023> might be permissions - is your account an admin account? <comment218024> yeah, its an admin account, its the only account i have on the mac. <comment218025> http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/18630/can-i-choose-the-name-of-a-folder-in-launchpad?rq=1 might be worth a look at
