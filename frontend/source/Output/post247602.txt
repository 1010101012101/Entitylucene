Core dumps aren't generated in El Captain <body> I used codeulimit -c unlimted/code in terminal to get core dumps in the code/cores/code folder. However, after reboot (kernel panic) I no longer can get any core dumps regardless what I try - codeulimit -c unlimted/code or codesudo sysctl -w kern.coredump=1/code - core dumps just don't get generated.  How should I enable core dumps for the terminal session? I used core dumps to debug my console application.
