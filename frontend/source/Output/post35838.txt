Thunderbolt Target Display Mode, iMac still running? <body> I'm considering getting an iMac to be an external display for my Air via the Thunderbolt cable. When you put the iMac into Target Display Mode is it still available as a headless computer without a display?  UPDATE: close question, but oposite Will my iMac stay on if I use it&#39;s display in target display mode for a Mac mini?  <answer35842> Yes the iMac does stay on, I have the 2010 model. CMD + F2, (on your iMac), will allow you to swap back and forth between the two computers.  <comment40868> You can also look in the Apple Support Document: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht3924 <comment40885> yes thanks! "Applications running on the 27-inch iMac computer remain open and running while it is in Target Display mode." <comment40890> Glad we could help. I just ordered my Belkin cable yesterday, took me a while to figure this out as well.
