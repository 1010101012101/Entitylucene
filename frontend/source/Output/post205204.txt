BOOTCAMP partition cannot be mounted <body> After working in Windows for a couple of days, then booting back to OSX - I cannot mount my BOOTCAMP partition in Mac OS X any more. Disk utility shows BOOTCAMP as "greyed out". Trying to mount throws an error "The disk BOOTCAMP could not be mounted. Try running First Aid". I cannot run First Aid because it is also greyed out.  I still can boot into Windows just fine via alt/boot. Moreover strongeven Parallels/strong can boot the Bootcamp partition just fine! (I mean, from OSX, as a virtual machine).  PS. I'm using Yosemite, and Windows 10 Bootcamp.  PPS. If I do this:  precode# cd /Volumes # mkdir /Volumes/Bootcamp # sudo mount_ntfs /dev/disk0s4 /Volumes/Bootcamp /code/pre  It works fine. But it mounts it readonly, also I want it to mount automatically on startup, like it was before...  UPDATE: After digging through the system log I found this: code"Windows is hibernated. Will not be able to remount read-write. Run chkdsk."/code - A-HA! This must be it.  But its not hibernated... Ok, guess I have to boot into windows again and shut-down/restart it a couple of times to clear the hibernation flag...  <answer205328> Basically, what worked is booting to Windows natively and shutting it down strongseveral times/strong to clear the hibernation flag. Also, disabled hibernation via power-management and via codepowercfg /h off/code.  <comment247460> Don't try to boot from a Windows partition that is suspended in Parallels. Shut it down first. <comment247466> @Tetsujin that is the problem. The partition is NOT suspended/hibernated. I even disabled hibernation with `powercfg /h off`. Somehow Windows has still marked the partition as hibernated! <comment247467> Have you tried booting it to Parallels then shutting down, just to see if it would clear the flag? Alternatively try Paragon NTFS or similar to enable Repair & write mount - natively, Disk Utility cannot repair a WIn drive, so that's why it's greyed out. I've never trusted the built-in [NTFS write support](http://osxdaily.com/2013/10/02/enable-ntfs-write-support-mac-os-x/) so idk if that would work
