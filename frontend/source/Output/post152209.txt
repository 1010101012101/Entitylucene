Is it possible to rename "iCloud Drive"? <body> I do not like folder names with a space in them...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ivWoC.png" alt="enter image description here"  Can I rename codeiCloud Drive/code to another name, say, codeiDrive/code?  <answer152218> The iCloud Drive item in the sidebar actually points to ~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs. That said, it is not possible to rename the sidebar item, and do NOT rename the folder. Doing so will strikelikely/strike definitely cause iCloud Drive to stop functioning (if it even lets you rename it).
