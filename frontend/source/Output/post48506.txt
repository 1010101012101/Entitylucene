Can I upgrade my MacBook with more than 4GB of RAM? <body> I have an Early 2008 13 inch MacBook updated to Lion. According to this Apple KB the max RAM I can add is 4GB.   I know the OS that came with the initial computer didn't support 64 bit. So is this 4 GB limit a hardware or software limitation? Can I add more than 4 GB now that I have Lion (I understand it supports 64 bit)?  <answer48509> You can add up to 6GB of RAM in your MacBook. You can see the list here.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RUgGm.png" alt="Depending on your"   <comment55561> It is my understanding that RAM works better in pairs. Since I can't find 3 + 3, do you recommend I go 4 + 2, or just stay with 4 (2 + 2)? <comment55562> You need to go with 4 + 2. That's what I've done on my Late 2007 MacBook Pro (3,1). I have been using it that way for three years. <comment55563> Check with Other World Computing. http://goo.gl/LzGO0.
