Errors in installing OpenMPI on El Capitan <body> I'm following this guide to install OpenMPI on my Mac. I emthink/em everything is going well, but now I'm at the step where I have to codemake all/code. When I try, I get the error codeAgreeing to the Xcode/iOS license requires admin privileges, please re-run as root via sudo./code, so I can't go further.  strongEDIT/strong: looking at the downvoted answer here I tried to run Xcode and say ok to license agreement. Now, when I enter codemake all/code I get the error in the following figure   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QxGIc.png" alt="screenshot"  Indeed, I see there's no file named codemakefile/code (only codeMakefile.*/code files are present).  I don't know why but a second code./configure --prefix=/usr/local/code solved the problem of codemake all/code, which is currently in execution. Maybe the license agreement should have been done before this step.  <answer229649> I find the solution to my problem. The the license agreement was required to be completed embefore/em code./configure --prefix=/usr/local/code (as I suspected and @klanomath confirmed). If not so, the command codemake all/code can't be run.  <comment280143> There is no need to delete the question. You may answer the question yourself! <comment280144> Yes the license agreement was required first. confgure calls the C compiler and the first run would have reported errors.
