Time Machine Backup to Samba Share under Mac OS Lion <body> In earlier versions of Mac OS you could enable TimeMachine to use Samba-Shares as a Backup-Target using this:  precodedefaults write com.apple.systempreferences TMShowUnsupportedNetworkVolumes 1 /code/pre  and create a backup image with this script.  Sadly Time Machine now says that my drive does not support the necessary AFP protocol.   Is there a workaround for this?   <answer19265> Suspiciously named Msftguy has written a program that fakes the required AFP features for unsupported volumes.  AFAIK this is currently the only way to use non-AFP volumes with 10.7 lion.  Use at your own risk!  Details  Executable  <answer58755> I used this blogpost as a guide, and it works quite well: http://basilsalad.com/how-to/create-time-machine-backup-network-drive-lion/  The approach is to create an HFS+ drive image on the network drive, mount it using tmutil, then use it with Time Machine.  Since the drive appears to be HFS+, there should be no issue with using older AFP versions or even SMB/Samba on typical NAS drives and Linux servers.  <comment67773> Links may break rendering your answer unhelpful.
