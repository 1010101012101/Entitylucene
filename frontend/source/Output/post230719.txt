How to disable app relaunch and window restore in El Capitan on reboot? <body> How do I disable  both the "relaunch apps after reboot" feature as well as the "reopen windows at relaunch" feature?  When I reboot (be it after a hard reset or reboot command) I want to be presented with a blank desktop and not everything I had open before.  Also, when I open an application, I don't want the dozen things I was working on previously to open all at once.  <answer230723> To keep applications from opening previous documents, go to System Preferences  General and tick the Close windows when quitting an app checkbox.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yjLad.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  To keep the relaunch apps after reboot from occurring, un-tick the checkbox on the Shutdown or Restart pop-up window:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2TOVE.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer253609> If you are looking for a way to permanently disable this feature so you don't have to remember the extra "uncheck the box" step every time you turn your machine off, you can simply deny OS X access to the file it uses to store your session state.  In a terminal,  precode# Make the file owned by root (otherwise the OS will just replace it) sudo chown root ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.loginwindow*  # Remove all permissions, so it can't be read or written to sudo chmod 000 ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.loginwindow* /code/pre  If you wish to undo this change later and re-enable the feature, perhaps because you've suffered brain damage and now find boot-looping amusing, simply delete this file and the OS will recreate it.  precode# Re-enable El Capitan's obnoxious "relaunch all the things" behavior sudo rm -f ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.loginwindow* /code/pre  <answer275773> The simplest solution and the one I use, is to locate the file in finder: ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.loginwindow  Then either close all applications to empty the above files contents, or preferably just open the file in Text Edit and delete all contents then save it.  Then, reselect the file in finder but do not open it  Then, press the Apple key (next to space-bar) + i, or go to file menu and click "Get Info". Then under the General section of the displayed information window, check the "Locked" selection box (file is then locked).  Using this method it's much easier to enable or un-enable, as the process is much simpler to remember. Terminal code you use occasionally is not likely to be easily remembered or retrieved.  <comment281653> I already have the first box checked, and I always uncheck the reopen box.  But when I have to do a hard reset for whatever reason, all 50 things I had open relaunch, and I'm trying to stop that. <comment281672> I'd concentrate on fixing whatever is causing you to have to hard reset. Right now you're asking the car mechanic to fix the horn because the brakes don't work. <comment333423> Such a great solution. This has been annoying me for so long, but never took the time to research how to stop it permanently. <comment359261> The best answer. Works on El Capitan and Sierra.
