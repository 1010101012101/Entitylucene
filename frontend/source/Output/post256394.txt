Trying to make an applescript to send email when external IP changes <body> I am trying to make an applescript that will run continuously and send me an email whenever my external IP changes.  I have a code so far that seems to me like it should work but it sends me emails many times per minute even though the code is only supposed to do it when the IP changes.  Can someone please double-check my code and make sure i'm not doing anything wrong? Thanks!  precodeset recipientName to "xxxxx" set recipientAddress to "xxxxx@xxx.com" set theSubject to "Your External IP Address" set externalIP to 0 repeat  if externalIP â‰  (do shell script "curl -m 60 -s checkip.dyndns.org | sed -e 's/.*Current IP Address: //' -e 's/&lt;.*$//'") then     set externalIP to do shell script "curl -m 60 -s checkip.dyndns.org | sed -e 's/.*Current IP Address: //' -e 's/&lt;.*$//'"     tell application "Mail"          ##Create the message         set theMessage to make new outgoing message with properties {subject:theSubject, content:externalIP, visible:true}          ##Set a recipient         tell theMessage             make new to recipient with properties {name:recipientName, address:recipientAddress}              ##Send the Message             send          end tell     end tell end if end repeat /code/pre  Thank you all for your help!  <comment319749> you will have to set an interval so that it will check the current IP every so often. <comment319763> @ozziespin but the if-then statement should make it only send the email when it changes, no matter how often it checks <comment319785> Maybe the website does not always respond resulting in an empty right value in the comparison. <comment319909> @root then wouldn't it send an empty email?  All the emails have the same ip <comment319940> @user6086585 the IP is fetched twice, the IP in the email is not the result that is fetched in the comparison. <comment320062> @root but it gets fetched again and the IP won't revert back at any point, once the IP changes it stays that way.  If the ip is 1.1.1.1 and then it checks and finds that it changed to 2.2.2.2 and checks again it will be 2.2.2.2.  The external IP changes and stays the same for days or weeks.  Am I missing something? <comment321340> @user6086585 curl does not get a response when you call it in the comparison you get an empty string, not an IP address <comment321597> @root thank you sir!
