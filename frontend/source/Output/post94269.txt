Applescript code to simulate Command and Shift keys <body> I am handicapped and use Dragon Dictate 3. I need to take control of my Mac with Dragon, because I am not be able to use the keyboard. I need to know some Applescript code to do that.  How could I simulate the pressing of the Command key and the Shift key to select multiple items in Finder?  First of all, Thanks to adayzdone for his solution.  I tested these with some success. So let me give it to you for helping other user which are experiencing problems.  strong1) locking Command key on Dragon dictate 3 procedure./strong  strongName of the command (in french) : " Vérrouillage Touche Commande ". Method : Applescript Context : Finder/strong  precodeset _dictateApp to (name of current application)     tell application "System Events"         tell process "Finder"             command key down         end tell     end tell /code/pre  strong2) unlocking Command key on Dragon dictate 3 procedure.

Thanks to all Claude  <answer94280> Briefly looking at the Dragon Dictate manual: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SnBDj.png" alt="enter image description here"  A script like this will let you select the next item of a Finder window:  precode--key code 126 -- up arrow Key --key code 125 -- down arrow Key  activate application "Finder" tell application "System Events"     key code 125 using shift down end tell /code/pre  <comment110504> thx for editing my question and to correct my orthography <comment110506> How would the workflow be triggered? I'm assuming you don't use a mouse? Do you want all of the items of the front window selected ... or items 1 - 3 of 5 ? The more details of the workflow you can include, the easier it will be for people in the forums to help. <comment110510> Following up on @adayzdone's comment, there may be better ways to do this than just replicating Cmd and Shift in AppleScript. I don’t have an AppleScript dictionary to hand, but I think Finder has a `select` command which might be useful, although I can’t remember how it works. <comment110515> I would be able to select all items ones below others AND items 1-3 or 5. Give me all the possibility. No mouse, no keyboard, only voice with custom commands using applescript code, shell, automator workflow. I am looking for a simple program to lock and unlock only modification keys such as command and shift keys, or a program to select multiple items on finder. thanks <comment110516> I will test this solution on this post... http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/69256/pressing-the-control-key-with-applescript?rq=1 <comment110519> thanks a lot dear friend. The solution of the other post also works. I just tested it. <comment166277> I know how to perform mouse clicks. I know Dragon Dictation allows it by saying "mouseclick" but I would like to just say "click" Does anyone know the AppleScript code for this?
