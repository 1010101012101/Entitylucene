Mac startup key sequences <body> What are the Mac hardwares various startup key sequences?   On the older Macs, Shift used to be start without extensions, Ctrl-Apple-O-F would boot to OpenFirmware, (but didn't the Intel Macs switch to EFI BIOS's?)  If the shortcut is hardware specific, please note it.  <answer1503> Google is your friend: http://www.jacsoft.co.nz/Tech_Notes/Mac_Keys.shtml  hr  ul liBypass startup drive and boot from external (or CD): kbdcommand/kbdkbdoption/kbdkbdshift/kbdkbddelete/kbd/li liBoot from CD (Most late model Apples): kbdC/kbd/li liForce the internal hard drive to be the boot drive: kbdD/kbd/li liBoot from a specific SCSI ID #.

My question was meant to be slightly more subtle and look for Intel based vs Power PC based as well. <comment1338> Actually most of those work across both architectures and the page is current (March 2010). Other than the Open Firmware specific keys, the Mac Classic specific keys and the Target Disk Mode key that does not work on non-firewire MacBooks regardless of architecture, what isn't covered? <comment3641> I think this would make a great Community Wiki topic. <comment3642> @VxJasonxV Community Wiki is for semi-offtopic posts or posts where a lot of people are editing the answers. Unless we're going to have each key combination posted in a separate answer, I don't see the need for this post to be Community Wiki. <comment3644> Why don't we have each key combination (and their use requirements) in a separate answer? <comment3645> @VxJasonxV It's not necessary to do that
