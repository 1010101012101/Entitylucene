Hide/Show Battery Icon in Menu Bar with AppleScript <body> Is there any method to display the battery menu bar status item with AppleScript? I’ve tried to browse the script library but unable to find one that matches this capability.  I simply want to toggle the state of menu bar item found in strongSystem Preferences » Energy Saver » Power Adapter/strong setting. There is no need to build an AppleScript application for it.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/f5tDu.jpg" alt="OS X Yosemite » Energy Saver » Power Adapter"  <answer151190> delThe question is vague./del Do you mean an applescript to display the dropdowm menu from the battery icon on the right hand side of menu bar?  precodetell application "System Events" to tell process "SystemUIServer"     click (first menu bar item whose value of attribute "AXDescription" contains "Battery") of menu bar 1 end tell /code/pre  <answer151209> strongUpdate: This updated script wouldn't flash through the screen, i.e runs in the backgound.

In other words, you will see system pref flash through your screen. And then the setting is changed. I'm too spread out to write out the code now. <comment177883> Perhaps "Hide/Show Battery Icon in Menu Bar with Applescript" is a more fitting title. <comment177884> I’ve opened Accessibility but unable to find the setting you mentioned. Can it still be done with AppleScript (I’m also welcome idea using shell script. <comment177885> @fartheraway thanks! I was wondering what’s wrong with my question title.  <comment177886> It's not a setting. The Accessibility Panel in SysPref simply grant/deny permission for apps to take over you mouse and keyboard, eg accessibility. Applescript can intact with UI. Shell cannot. Look for Accessibility Inspector in Xcode if you want to code. <comment177901> This is exactly what I’m looking for (despite that I prefer it to run in background without opening System Preferences). Is there any way to get the value of checkbox to see if it’s enabled/disabled? <comment177912> Never mind, I’ve found the answer on StackOverflow on [this thread](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9690129/tick-a-checkbox-only-if-its-not-selected).
