Is there a CVS client for Mac OS X? <body> Could anyone recommend me a free tool to use on OSX for keeping my CVS projects?  I am using the integrated SVN on OSX for all my SVN projects; maybe there are similar commands on the terminal to access a CVS repository.  <answer32714> I have /usr/bin/cvs, which has been installed together with Xcode; albeit, it might be Xcode 3.  just doing a check the file is still here under Mavericks and Xcode 5 and I have done clean upgrade since the original answer  <comment37411> Indeed, that should be all you need for command-line interactions.  Are you looking for a GUI? <comment37419> if you know something good i would also consider using a gui for this one... <comment39366> I don't use raw CVS or SVN with GUI (but Versions is perfect), I use it within my IDE when I develop something. So you can try Xcode or IntelliJ Idea (I use it only under evaluation licence, Community Edition is completely free) . fast search over Internet shows that most of CVS viewer projects are dead (last version is PPC), but you can recompile them to use it with your OS.
