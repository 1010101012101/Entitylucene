Why do some of my iPad apps stop working? <body> I get apps that work offline. However, on occasion the apps I download just don't work. When I start one up, it shows up with the start up screen. But then it goes straight back to the home screen.  I can fix this by deleting one app and installing it again. The only reason I have the Facebook app is to do this.However, I would like to know what's causing my apps not to work at times.  <comment108378> My first suggestion would be to restore your firmware. <comment108380> @demure when you say "restore your firmware" do you mean restoring the ipad to factory setting, how would that help? <comment108381> I mean: connect your ipad to computer - go to itunes - select ipad - summery tab - click "restore ipad".
