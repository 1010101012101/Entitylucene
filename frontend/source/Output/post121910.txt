Also, I have tried looking at other people with similar or the same problems but I couldn't find anyone, this is very important to me for my phone is all I have left. please help.  <answer121949> It sounds like you had a tethered jailbreak. If this is so you will need to run it by your jailbreaking program again on your PC/Mac and then it should be working again.  This issue does not happen when you do untethered jailbreaks.  <comment142240> This doesn't sound like an untethered jailbreak especially since he knows that he used evasi0n.
