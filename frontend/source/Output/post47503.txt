How to control Bluetooth wireless radio from the command line? <body> This question is almost the same as my previous question, but with one major difference; I want to turn on/off Bluetooth from the command line (bash or similar), emNOT/em from AppleScript - the answers for this I saw on superuser all used AppleScript.  I would guess that codenetworksetup/code might be useful but have no idea what interface(s) to interact with - I would like an answer including a complete command I can run (and understand) - if device model matters, it's Snow Leopard on codeMacBook2,1/code to codeMacBook7,1/code, except codeMacBook5,1/code, and if you can only do for 6,1 and 7,1 that's fine.  <answer47508> strongBlueutil/strong is a neat little command line tool to do this. It's free and comes with the source code.  If you have homebrew installed, you can install it via codebrew install blueutil/code.     strongUsage:/strong      strongPrint bluetooth status/strongbr   codeblueutil/code      strongSwitch bluetooth on/strongbr   codeblueutil power 1/code      strongSwitch bluetooth off/strongbr   codeblueutil power 0/code   Works just fine on a Macbook Pro running Lion (10.7.3) and Mac mini running Snow Leopard (10.6.8). You will get some errors if you switch off the bluetooth whilst a magic mouse is connected, it still works though :)  <answer100572> The following worked for me (OSX 10.7.5) to turn bluetooth ON from the command line (using commands found here):  precodesudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.Bluetooth ControllerPowerState -int 1  sudo launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.blued.plist sudo launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.blued.plist /code/pre  (I ran into the problem that I disabled bluetooth and then on the next system start I could not use the wireless keyboard anymore... so no logging in from the screen but I could log in via ssh. And it was not clear to me how to install software such as codeblueutil/code from the command line as suggested by @binarybob )  <comment54416> You can run AppleScript from the command line using `osascript -e ""` if popping up windows is the only issue you have with using it. <comment54457> Thank you. I'll accept this soon but don't like to accept within 6 hours after posting (if you can do this without downloading anything, just using built-in OS X that would also be very nice so I'm waiting to see if someone suggests that). <comment54458> I don't like AppleScript as a language; it tends to be verbose. <comment54460> Also, Assistive Devices aren't enabled and I can't admin on this computer. <comment54464> @Andrew The other way you could do this without downloading anything is by killing (and restarting) the bluetooth daemon process (blued) as follows. However, I would recommend **not to use this method** as it plays havoc with the bluetooth preferences pane and the bluetooth status icon in the menubar, as they now will not be able to update themselves any more. To stop the bluetooth daemon: `sudo launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.blued.plist`. To restart the bluetooth daemon: `sudo launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.blued.plist` <comment54466> @Andrew Ah, I just noticed in an earlier comment you said you couldn't "admin on this computer". If I've understood that correctly then my previous comment won't work as you need to type an admin password to `sudo` <comment54557> It's OK, `blueutil` worked fine. <comment84375> blueutil has some questionable code included. It attempts to use an osax called XMail. XMail is a free osax for Mac OS X allowing you to send e-mail from AppleScript. Be careful of software you give admin privileges to. Here's a message I got in Terminal when I ran the installer but before I authorized admin privileges. Error loading /Library/ScriptingAdditions/XMail.osax/Contents/MacOS/XMail: dlopen(/Library/ScriptingAdditions/XMail.osax/Contents/MacOS/XMail, 262): no suitable image found. <comment84376> I didn't give it an admin privilege. I just copied out the binary. <comment97596> Yeah, just copied the binary to /usr/local/bin. But where's that questionable code? Took a look at the included source and it looked legit, didn't build it though. <comment118426> I can't sudo on this computer, as per one  of my other comments, but this is still nice to know. I unpacked blueutil graphically and then ran the executable from the command line, so I had to already have set it up. <comment160163> This was a great answer and BTW, you can `brew install blueutil` to easily install it. They seem to have changed the command line flags, use `blueutil power 1` to turn on bluetooth. <comment217956> And `blueutil power 0` to turn off. <comment275260> As binarybob previously said in his [comment](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/47503/how-to-control-bluetooth-wireless-radio-from-the-command-line#comment-54464), this can confuse the GUI
