App to manage copy and paste? <body> I'm looking for an app to manage copy and paste tasks.  What I need is to have shorcuts to the last copied text.   Let's say I copy these 4 lines in 4 times:  precode111111 222222 333333 444444 /code/pre  Then I'd like to have 4 shortcuts to paste every one of them. Something like:  cmd + 1 (to paste '111111') cmd + 2 (to paste '222222') and so on..  The closed match I found is Clipmenu since it seems that you can use the shortcuts I need (cmd + 1, cmd + 2...) but it doesn't work though  <answer60798> I use FlyCut, you can do Cmd-Shift-V and then cycle through your recently copied texts with arrow keys.  <comment70047> Why doesn't Clipmenu work? <comment70049> the shortcut simple doesn't work. If I copy some text and press cmd + 1 I just hear a sound and nothing happens. Should I set some actions in Preferences? <comment70051> Please open another question for the Clipmenu issue then <comment70053> ok, I did it. thanks
