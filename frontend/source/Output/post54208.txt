Cannot remove the HomeSync Icon <body> I hooked my MacBook up to an Apple server for testing and I created a mobile account on the unit. I've since decided to go back to just having a local account on the MacBook. The process I did was to the following:  ol liCreate a new Admin account on the MacBook./li liLog into the Admin account./li liBackup the home folder of the network account./li liDelete the network account from System Preferences - Users./li liCreate a new local account with the same name as the old network account./li liRestore the backed up home folder./li liReset all permissions on the restored home folder (codesudo chown …/code)./li liLogged into the newly created local account./li /ol  Now everything has been working fine on my system and I'm not having any permissions issues, or weird ghosts coming out of the closet strongexcept for one thing/strong.  I cannot seem to be able to get rid of the HomeSync icon from my toolbar. I've pressed kbdcommand ⌘/kbd while dragging the icon off of the toolbar (disappears in a cloud of smoke), but when I log out and log back in, it's back.  How can I get rid of the HomeSync icon once and for all? I am trying this in lion  hr  h3update/h3  Updating to mountain-lion did not solve the issue.  <answer76916> It must have been a bug in the OS that was finally fixed. I just "ignored it" for, well, months... and upon looking at this question today, I decided to look up, and low-and-behold, it's gone.  After months of having to drag it off of the bar, it's now gone for good. Not sure when it left, but it's fixed.
