How do I create a browsable index of my External Hard Disks? <body> I have 7-8 External Hard Disk Drives. I would like to be able to know the content of each of the drives (files and folders) without having to connect them to my system (cumbersome).   Is there and program that can create a browsable snapshot of the directory listing?  <answer223315> Here you are.
