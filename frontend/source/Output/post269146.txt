Early 2013 MBP Retina 15 won't boot unless Thunderbolt -> Ethernet dongle plugged in <body> My early 2013 Macbook Pro Retina 15" started to freeze a few days ago. The only way to get it (sort of) working was by holding the power button down and forcing a reboot.   After a few days of investigation, I found that if I have the Thunderbolt to Ethernet dongle plugged into the computer (even if there's no ethernet cable connected!), it will boot up and function perfectly normally.   I've tried to reset both the SMC and NVRAM, as well as plugging in a MiniDP - DP adapter, and a USB3.0 Ethernet adapter into my computer and booting up. None of these steps have worked.  I've also reinstalled the system (trying Sierra, Mountain Lion, and El Capitan) and none of these resolved the problem.     Can someone please tell me what to do next? I'm a bit desperate. Thank you so much!  <answer269150> strong[This answer not final until this sentence deleted]/strong  Troubleshooting is a process of elimination and often requires patience. This means trying things one by one until you get to the bottom of the problem.  The next two things I would try are running an Apple Diagnostics Test and also booting into Safe Mode. See below.  strong1. Run Apple Diagnostics/strong  Follow the steps below to run Apple Diagnostics:  ol liFully shut down your MBP/li liDisconnect the Thunderbolt  Ethernet dongle/li liRestart your MBP/li liImmediately press the kbdD/kbd key and strongkeep it down/strong until you see the Diagnostics screen appear/li liWait for Diagnostics to finish (this typically only takes a few minutes)/li liOnce complete, one of two things will appear on the screen:  ul lia emNo issues found/em message/li lia brief description of any errors found plus further instructions/li /ul/li liIf the diagnostics test does find errors, take a note of what they are/li /ol  strongNote:/strong If pressing and holding the kbdD/kbd key at Step 3 doesn't work, start again at Step 1 and, at Step 3 press and hold both the kbdOption/kbdkbdD/kbd keys instead. This will try and run diagnostics from the internet instead, so you will need to allow more time for it to complete. If that still doesn't work, connect the Thunderbolt  Ethernet dongle and try following the above steps again (but skip Step 2).  Regardless, take a note of what happens.  strong2. Boot into Safe Mode/strong  Follow the steps boot your MBP into Safe Mode:  ol liFully shut down your MBP/li liDisconnect the Thunderbolt  Ethernet dongle/li liRestart your MBP/li liImmediately press the kbdShift/kbd key and strongkeep it down/strong /li liLet go of the kbdShift/kbd key when you see the login window (NOTE: If you have FileVault enabled you may need to log in twice)./li liTake a note of what happens (i.e. could you boot your MBP or not)/li liTo exitSafe Mode just restart your Mac as normal/li /ol  Once you've run the diagnostics and tested a boot into Safe Mode, let me know how you went and we'll go from there.  <comment338086> Please let us know if you are able to boot into the macOS Recovery (aka recovery partition): (1) shut down your Mac. (2) Power it up. (3) Immediately hold CMD+R together. <comment338088> @oa- not without the dongle. I can boot into internet recovery though. <comment338089> The Apple Diagnostics runs without reporting any problems. Both in quick mode and extended mode. Safe mode also hangs without the dongle. Verbose booting saw a lot of unsigned kext. Not sure if this is relevant. But the computer still <comment338090> But the computer still boots with the dongle plugged in while displaying the unsigned kexts. So I didn't think they would be the problem. <comment338092> What about a pram reset or SMC reset? <comment338093> @Jules done both. No difference <comment338094> Do you have access to another startup disk (or Mac) you can boot your MBP from? Or better still, another OS installed (e.g. a Bootcamp Windows installation) you can boot from? Also, did you run Diagnostics with the dongle connected or disconnected (or both)? <comment338095> Can you boot in safe mode? perhaps try to remove the network interface in you system preferences that uses the dongle <comment338106> both connected and disconnected the Diagnostics return no problems. I'm installing Ubuntu via a USB stick onto it as we speak, with the dongle disconnected, having no problems so far. <comment338108> @Jules Can't boot in safe mode without the dongle either. Removing the interface in preferences does nothing :( <comment338113> Ubuntu runs fine.
