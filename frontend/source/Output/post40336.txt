Measure Application Load Times? <body> Anyone know a way to measure application load times? I've looked at instruments but having a hard time pinning down the statistic/event I should be looking for.   I want to measure how long it takes for the app to finish loading, (the window appears) etc  <comment45661> What are you trying to accomplish? How precise of a measurement do you need? <comment45799> Just in miliseconds. Essentially comparing the loading times of different browsers.
