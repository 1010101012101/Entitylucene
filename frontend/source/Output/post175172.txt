Eclipse Fails To Launch Complaining of Incompatible Java VM <body> I get the following error when trying to launch Eclipse, which I recently tried to install.  "Version 1.6.0_65 of the JVM is not suitable for this product.  Version 1.7 or greater is required."  I'm running Mountain Lion.  I have the most recent 1.8 installed from Oracle, and this is the install I would like Eclipse to be using.  The following image shows the info from the Java Control Panel including the version number and the install path.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0EyYE.png" alt="Oracle Installed JavaVM version and path"  Here's is the info on the Apple installed Java VM which is the one Eclipse is currently trying to use.  precode~&gt; which java /usr/bin/java ~&gt; java -version java version "1.6.0_65" Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_65-b14-462-11M4609) Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 20.65-b04-462, mixed mode) ~&gt; ls -l /usr/bin/java lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  74 Oct 16  2013 /usr/bin/java -&gt; /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/Current/Commands/java /code/pre  <answer175267> From your comments you have  the Java 8 JRE which is only a web plugin you need to install the Java 8 JDK  Changing things in ~/.bashrc does not effect the environment of apps launched in the GUI  <comment206439> Which version of eclipse did you try <comment206441> eclipse-standard-luna-SR2-macosx-cocoa-x86_64.tar.gz which I believe is version 4.4.2 <comment206474> Which Java 1.8 did you install? and what does `java -version` show <comment206555> `~ which java /usr/bin/java ~ java -version java version "1.6.0_65" Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_65-b14-462-11M4609) Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 20.65-b04-462, mixed mode) ~ `  All of which refers, I believe, to the Apple installed JVM. <comment206557> I've added an image to the question showing the info on the Oracle Java VM installation pulled from the Java Control Panel.  It specifies version 1.8.0_31 and is installed in `/Library/Internet Plug-Ins/JavaAppletPlugin.plugin/Contents/Home/bin/java`.  I imagine this is the install I should be using for Eclipse. <comment206573> Setting JAVA_HOME is my .bashrc made no difference.  Nor could I figure out how to use the -vm flag in Eclipse.ini. <comment208375> Installing the Java 8 JDK solved the problem.  Thank you.
