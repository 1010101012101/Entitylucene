Word for Mac: how to increase/decrease font size with (laptop) keyboard? <body> Again, title says it all.  On a normal Mac keyboard, shortcuts for font increase/decrease are:  SHIFT CMD &lt; - decrease SHIFT CMD  - increase  However, on a laptop keyboard the latter doesn't work. I just can't reach the "" key while CMD pressed. Turn on the keyboard viewer and see for yourself.  I press SHIFT, the "&lt;" turns to "", so far so good... but once i press CMD (while still holding SHIFT), it goes back to "&lt;" so I can only decrease font size, but not increase.  These shortcuts are speeding up the workflow tremendously, I wan't 'em! :-)  Any suggestions? Thanx...  <answer129668> OK, I've found the answer. You can assign keyboard shortcuts to any Word 2011 command. Go to Tools, then Customize Keyboard. Choose Format category. Find GrowFont and assign a keyboard shortcut to it. Find ShrinkFont and assign a keyboard shortcut to it.  I assigned CMD+SHIFT+Arrow keys (up to grow, down to shrink).  They make no conflicts to me, and they are Word only.  These two single keyboard shortcuts make worlds of difference when editing docs.  <answer144891> ul liIncrease the font size: kbd⌘/kbd-kbd+/kbd/li liDecrease the font size: kbd⌘/kbd-kbd-/kbd/li /ul  <answer193058> Increase the font size : COMMAND + SHIFT +   Decrease the font size : COMMAND + SHIFT + &lt;   <comment130656> What language keyboard are you using? <comment229947> This is exactly what the OP said didn't work. <comment230064> Its working for me.

It adds nothing. <comment260111> CMD+ "+" changes to superscript, are you using custom shortcuts? <comment369423> This worked fine on my 2012 Macbook Pro with Word 15.33.
