How to search a phrase in Preview of OS X? <body> When I search for a term like "formation water", preview returns everything starting with formation and not the term "formation water". How can I search for a phrase in Preview?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ywyWP.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer155411> Just like you would with a Google search, use the double quotes operator to tell Preview the result must be an exact match.  In your case, for example, typing code"formation water"/code should yield the desired result.  <comment182826> Without double quotes, the query `formation water` returns every page that contain both the words `formation` and `water`, regardless of how they are scattered around the page. <comment349711> My finger and I thank you very much!
