How to auto run a simple python program when the terminal opens <body> Say I have a python program called foo.py that prints a line of text. How can I auto run that program when I boot up the terminal? I know you can, but I can't find the documentation. Also no third party programs please, I'm not looking to make the program executable, just to have it run on the terminal start up.   <answer95165> You can put command to run the script in code.bashrc/code file inside your home directory, this file is read every time you open non-login shell (Terminal, Iterm and their tabs).  precodepython /path/to/foo.py /code/pre  Don't forget to set the permissions for all to execute:  precodechmod a+x foo.py /code/pre  <comment111597> Didn't need `chmod a+x foo.py` is that a problem? All I did was designate the directory in my .bashrc_profile? <comment111600> It's not a problem - it depends how you call foo.py. If you use `python foo.py` you do not need to set the execute permissions. If you instead use simply `foo.py`, you do.
