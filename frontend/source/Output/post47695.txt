Double tap to drag no longer works <body> I used to have the double-tap-to-drag working, where I would tap the trackpad, let go, then tap-and-hold and it would begin dragging.  I temporarily disabled the codeTap to click/code setting in System Preferences, and now after I reenabled it, I no longer have double-tap-to-drag. codeTap to click/code does work, it's just the dragging that no longer works. I don't see any setting to enable double-tap-to-drag. Is it automatically supposed to work when codeTap to click/code is enabled?  I've tried it with codeThree finger drag/code both enabled and disabled, but nothing works.  <answer47700> Go to strongSystem Preferences  Universal Access  Mouse &amp; Trackpad  Trackpad Optionsâ€¦/strong and enable Drag Lock.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6ki3o.png" alt="screenshot"  <comment54643> Thanks! It works even with the setting `without Drag Lock` enabled, as long as the checkbox near `Dragging` is checked. <comment87070> This works great. One thing though is when you let go after dragging, it takes a second before it "drops". Any way to get that to be instantly after you let go? <comment88643> @Joe None that I know of.
