How to change the language of App Store <body> I usually have my iPhone in US English. I'm a French speaker living in the USA, and I sometimes like to revert to French to help my folks with their phones by knowing what right wording to use to guide them.  But I can't get the App Store back to French. Here are my settings:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BGSQS.png" alt="french language settings"  And here is the App Store - still mostly in English, even after a restart, except for a few app banners:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4b8lM.png" alt="enter image description here"  Can I get the whole app in French through the settings? Is this happening because I am in the US?
