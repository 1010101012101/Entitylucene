On Mountain Lion, Trash doesn't Empty <body> there is a file stuck in the trash   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bBRRi.png" alt="enter image description here"  This is what it shows when i do 'Get Info'  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/40uMm.png" alt="enter image description here"  When i 'Empty' the trash   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PUwxu.png" alt="enter image description here"  The sound plays, the trash window disappears, but the Trash icon doesn't appear empty and the file is still there when i reopen the trash. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/knGto.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5nfI5.png" alt="enter image description here"  I've tried the terminal img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/H184W.png" alt="enter image description here"  According to the terminal, there is no file in the Trash folder.  What am i missing? How can i solve this?   strongEDIT/strong So, i found out that the file is actually in another volume and as the Trash shows the 'trash' for all volumes, the file is being shown in the trash.  So, the file is in the Trash for my Bootcamp volume [/Volumes/BOOTCAMP/.Trashes/501]  I try deleting it from the terminal img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MGP1N.png" alt="enter image description here"   but its still there img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Vd4tk.png" alt="enter image description here"  what do i do?  <answer91619> One simple idea first: hold down the option (alt) key as you choose Finder  Empty Trash (see Apple's HT1526).  If that doesn't work, I noticed that if you look closely in your Get Info screenshot, you can see that the file is actually in /Volumes/BOOTCAMP/.Trashes/501, not ~/.Trash.  I'd try coderm -f /Volumes/BOOTCAMP/.Trashes/501/2.Broke.Girls.S02E19.HDTV.XvID-AFG/code  <answer91620> The Trash contains files from different volumes. Try runningâ€¦  precoderm -rfv /Volumes/BOOTCAMP/.Trashes/* /code/pre  Depending on drive permissions, this may have to be run using codesudo/code.  <comment107589> Did you try rebooting ? <comment107635> yes, i did try to reboot. Doesn't fix the problem <comment107636> that's what i was missing. So, now i know where the file is. I can see it with ls. but when i try to delete it with 'rm -f', the terminal shows no error or success message, and the file is still there. What is wrong? <comment107638> +1, i did have to use 'sudo', but the file is still there (even though the 'rm' command doesn't show any error message, or a success message either) <comment107641> Can you post the results from `ls -al` in that directory, and also `id` (so we can see your user ID for comparison)?
