Remote controlling my grandmother's iPad <body> My grandmother has an iPad 2 with iOS 9.3.5. Due to old age and Parkinsons, she's sometimes having issues using it for very basic tasks. We (her daughter and grandkids) want to be able to somehow remote control it, to help her with things like opening attachments to emails, finding her sister's blog in the bookmarks, and so on. We would like to be able to see the screen so we can give her better instructions over the phone, and be able to click things for her.  Between us, we have two laptops with Windows 10, an iPad with iOS 10.2 and a MacBook Pro with macOS 10.12.1. Being able to remote control it from any one of these devices would be sufficient. Once installed, the software should not require anything from my grandma.  What is the easiest way to do this?  <comment334151> There are some more similar questions with answers listed in the "Related" sidebar. <comment334159> See the answer [here](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/84722/how-to-control-your-ipad-with-your-mac-remotely?rq=1) <comment334163> If she has some problems with tapping on the buttons You can also enable "Touch Accommodations" or other accessibility features.
