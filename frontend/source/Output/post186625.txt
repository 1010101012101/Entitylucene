CPU Usage shoots all of a sudden while using Ubuntu in Virtual box in MBP <body> I an using 2015 model of MacBook Pro running Mac OS X Yosemite. I have installed Oracle VirtualBox 4.3.26 which runs Ubuntu 14.04 operating system. I have also installed the guest edition to improve performance.  When I open a large text file and scroll a view.
