How can you edit the Accent Menu? <body> The English language doesn't really include any accented words but other languages do.br Yet I like to write using accents and diacritics, as needed in each language (Romanian, French, German, etc.).  Unfortunately Mac OS X has never really made it easy to accent a letter before. Lion has simplified it, now accenting a letter is easy thanks to the strongAccent Menu/strong -- example:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5eKJT.png" alt="Accent Menu"  Still, if you take Romanian as an example, most of the specific diacritics are not reachable via the Accent Menu:  ul likbda/kbd » ă/li likbds/kbd » ș/li likbdt/kbd » ț/li /ul  Is there a way to edit the Accent Menu to add the accents that are used for a specific language?  <answer40377> I've seen this asked quite a few times since Lion was released last year, but as far as I know, nobody has found how to customize it yet.  I don't think it is that difficult to make accented characters, however, with either the US or US Extended layouts.  A chart is at  http://homepage.mac.com/thgewecke/diacritics.html  <answer40393> This menu does include the Romanian diacritics when you're using the Romanian input source. I've provided a tutorial on quickly changing the input sources in:  How can you customize the keyboard layout / shortcuts?
