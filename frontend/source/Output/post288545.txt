Copy macOS installation to second partition <body> I am running macOS Sierra 10.12.5 on the 4th partition of my HDD. The partitions in order:      codePartition 1, 280 MB: EFI/codebr   codePartition 2, 22 GB: Storage 1/codebr   codePartition 3, 186 GB: Storage 2/codebr   codePartition 4, 110 GB: Macintosh HD/codebr   codePartition 5, 600 MB: Recovery HD/code   Storage 2 has 102 GB available, and Macintosh HD only has 66 GB used, so space is not a problem. I need to copy my macOS installation from Macintosh HD to Storage 2, so that I can delete Macintosh HD, and expand Storage 2 to include the now free 110 GB. The catch is that I need to preserve emall/em the data on both partitions while copying the installation. User data, system preferences, my command line package managers, emeverything/em. Plus in doing so I need Storage 2 to become a bootable volume. Neither reinstalling macOS, wiping Storage 2 for a restore from Macintosh HD, or wiping and repartitioning the whole disk are options here (I don't have a spare drive large enough to store all that data on.).   I have tried a simple codesudo cp -R / /Volumes/Storage\ 2//code (from in-OS that is), but some files have read/copy permissions denied even to the root user, and that's with SIP emoff/em. So... anyone have any ideas? I'm not partial to either the GUI or command line, so long as it gets the job done. Thanks in advance!  <answer288691> Well, I managed to achieve what I needed using the following procedure:     1.) codesudo -i/codebr   emEnter root shell/em      2.) codemkdir /Volumes/Storage\ 2/Data/ &amp;&amp; mv /Volumes/Storage\ 2/* /Volumes/Storage\ 2/Data/ &amp;&amp; mv /Volumes/Storage\ 2/.* /Volumes/Storage\ 2/Data//codebr   emThis relocated all my data on the target volume to a separate folder/em      3.) codeditto -X -V --nocache / /Volumes/Storage\ 2//codebr   emThis copied all files and symlinks from my boot volume to the volume "Storage 2", and made "Storage 2" bootable in the process./em      4.) codereboot/code  Storage 2br   emBooted into Storage 2/em      5.) codediskutil eraseVolume "Free Space" Macintosh\ HD disk0s4/codebr   emDeleting the old boot volume, and leaving free space in its place/em      6.) codediskutil resizeVolume disk0s3 296G/codebr   emExpand the new boot volume to include the free space I just made/em      7.) codediskutil rename disk0s3 Macintosh\ HD/codebr   emRenamed new boot volume to match old one/em      8.) codediskutil eraseVolume "Free Space" Recovery\ HD disk0s5/codebr   emDelete faulty recovery partition/em      9.) codediskutil resizeVolume disk0s3 296.6G/codebr   emExpand new boot volume to include rest of free space/em   Since performing this half of my two-part project the partition scheme now looks like this:     Partition 1, 210 MB: EFIbr   Partition 2, 22 GB: Storage 1br   Partition 3, 297 GB: Macintosh HD     Hopefully this will be helpful for anyone else who needs to move their macOS installation to another partition without losing any data, or anyone who needs to make a bootable backup of their system before performing a potentially dangerous operation.  Now that this part is done, I just need to figure out how to turn "Storage 1" into a bootable installer partition.  <comment364423> I understand your questing and I don't have an answer, but IMHO you can try to move 40 Gb of non-system files (that are movable) to Storage 2, cleanup Storage 1 (also by moving them to Storage 2), clone Macintosh HD to Storage 1. Then boot from Storage 1 and merge those 3 partitions to one single. And even if you will boot from Storage 1, I still not sure that you will be able to repartition Storage 2 and Macintosh HD because unexpected and unexplained partition errors is a really often case in my experience. <comment364452> @toma While your suggestion would likely work, I should add that Storage 1 is currently reserved for other things, and needs to remain a separate partition. See, my Recovery HD partition hasn't worked since Mavericks, and I'd been having to use an installer USB as a recovery drive. Since I've decided to clone the installer USB for each new macOS release to Storage 1, and use it as an installer/recovery combo. I have potentially found an answer in the bash program `ditto`, however. <comment364580> step 5, 6, 8 and 9 can be summarized as `diskutil mergePartitions disk0s3 disk0s5`. <comment364590> @klanomath They could indeed, however I prefer to be verbose in my explanations, that way someone with less experience managing disks from the command line can still follow this procedure.
