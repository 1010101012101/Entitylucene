Time Machine keeps excluding my hard drive <body> I have Time Machine set up on a FireWire 800 external drive on my MacBook Pro. I have another USB external drive (formated NTFS with Paragon drivers so that I can store files bigger than 4 GB and access them from Windows) with  iMovie media etc and TM has been backing that up successfully (I can see the files in TM disk).  Recently I ran out of my internal SDD space and moved codeiPhoto Library/code to that external USB drive. Then I got fed up with constantly connecting the USB cable and decided to swap HDD and optical drive (using a solution similar to OptiBay). Again, everything is working fine.  strongThe Problem/strong is that I discovered that Time Machine has not made backups of the Media disk in a while (backups don't contain the codeiPhoto Library/code). Turns out that TM has that disk in the strongexclude list/strong for some reason.  No matter what I try, TM keeps adding the Media disk back to the exclude list every time I open the codeOptions.../code from TM prefs.  Some details:  precodeMac OS X 10.7.3  The disk in question is split in two partitions:   Media disk: NTFS, 400 GB with 290 GB used               I can remove it from exclude list, but it reappears   Stuff disk: FAT32 - never needed to be backed up nor ever has been               grayed out in exclude list, can't even remove TM disk free: ~ 500 GB Latest backup of Media seems to be March 2, 2012 (TM browser indicates),   which was prior to moving iPhoto Library /code/pre  BTW, now that the disk is internal anyhow, I can reformat the NTFS partition to HFS+ if that solves the problem. But TM did not have any problems with NTFS in the past. Why now?  <answer50524> Why it was possible is strange in the first place. The change may caused by a decision of Apple, packed in an update.  Reformat the NTFS partition to HFS+, will include your drive in Time Machine.  Note: also FAT formatted drives will not be backed up by Time Machine.  Update: Time Machine offers to use an NTFS volume if a write-enabled driver for NTFS is installed before a physical disk with NTFS is introduced to OS X. [source: Enabling Time Machine for a USB HDD with NTFS   <comment57990> This is exactly what I ended up doing (forgot to update this question). Before reformat, I used TM browser to delete all backups of the previous Media to free up disk space. Now backups have been running OK for a while. <comment65610> [Backup to NTFS … Restore from NTFS](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/57082/8546). Not only NTFS; with ZEVO, Time Machine can back up to ZFS. `tmutil` is present in all released builds of Lion, but the man page was not published by Apple until 10.7.4.
