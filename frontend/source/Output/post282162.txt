Can Sierra be installed on a virtual machine created by Parallels Desktop 10? <body> I’ve just stumbled across this site by accident and you good folk may be my last good hope before I abandon this endeavour.   strongMy questions are simple:/strong   ol liCan Sierra be installed on a virtual machine created by Parallels Desktop 10? /li liIf 'yes' to 1, how do I do this?/li /ol  —BACKGROUND—  I’ve heard a lot of conflicting stories about Sierra and would like to test it before taking the plunge of upgrading. I have a 27 inch mid 2011 iMac maxed out with 32GB RAM. I regularly run virtual machines in Parallels Desktop 10. These VMs (Windows XP, Windows 7, and Windows 8.1) all work splendidly, so I figure I could try running Sierra on a virtual machine too.  I’ve read Apple’s licensing conditions and this is legal. Since my iMac is capable of running Sierra natively, my conclusion is my hardware will run Sierra fine in a virtual machine too.  strongNow the problem…I can’t seem to create a Sierra virtual machine in Parallels Desktop 10./strong   I’ve tried following and adapting the steps found at this discussion forum (https://forums.developer.apple.com/message/143196), but with no joy to be found. Only frustration!  I’ve searched online (including here!) and cannot find confirmation anywhere that I can even do this on Parallels 10. Nothing to say it can be done. Nothing to say it cannot be done.  Apparently I have to purchase Parallels Desktop 12, or get my hands on Parallels Desktop 11 (cheaper) and create an El Capitan virtual machine and then upgrade to Sierra from within the VM (see http://blog.parallels.com/2016/06/16/macos-sierra-vm/). Thing is, I have no reason to upgrade from Parelles Desktop 10 as it meets my needs otherwise. Besides, Apple doesn’t charge for Sierra so why should I spend money to install it on a virtual machine?   In principle I believe this should be possible somehow and I’m frustrated within myself that I can’t seem to do it!   <answer282171> strongYes, this is possible./strong   It’s not actually too hard, but there’s a lot of steps (a couple of which can be emfiddly/em) so be patient and read this carefully. I’ll try and outline all the steps involved, but feel free to let me know if you get stuck at all.   Also, some of these steps are not strictly necessary, but I’m emtrying/em to make this foolproof so that it's useful to other users, and also because I want to ensure that my Terminal command at Step 12 can just be copied and pasted.  ol liOn your iMac, download the macOS Sierra installer via the Mac App Store/li liAfter its downloaded, the installer will launch automatically.

Thanks heaps! <comment355349> I'm following your steps but get an error after using your terminal command at step 12. I've tried copying and pasting it, and typing it in. Any thoughts? <comment355350> Hmm, I just double-checked the terminal command and it looks fine to me. So, back to you: Did you follow __all__ my steps from Step 1 to 12? Or did you skip something? <comment355351> I confess I skipped the first two steps but only because I already downloaded the installer a few days ago. Do I really need to download it again? <comment355352> No, but I'm guessing after you downloaded it the first time you moved the installer to another location, right? It needs to be back in the default location for my terminal command to work as it's currently written (basically I'm trying to make sure these steps work for other users, so I'm assuming _defaults_ here). So, if you still have the installer, move it back to the Applications folder. <comment355371> You legend! It took forever to install like you said, but Sierra is purring nicely in the VM. Thank you! <comment355491> I would very much like to give this a go. But why do you erase the USB twice? You do it in Disk Utility at step 9 and then again in Terminal at step 14. Why? <comment355494> That's true, but not because the USB needs to be erased twice. I wanted to make this answer useful to as many people as possible, and one way to do that is to make the Terminal command very easy to use. Most users never go near Terminal and it scares them. So my intention was to provide the Terminal command so that any user could just copy and paste it. Now, for that to work, I needed to ensure the USB drive had a particular volume name (in this case _Untitled_) as the command refers to this name! So I needed a way to ensure that was the name of the USB for anyone following these steps. <comment355495> In that sense, Steps 5 - 10 could be replaced with other steps, such as just renaming the USB flash drive to _Untitled_, but then I thought there was always the risk of human error, so I went with this approach. In a nutshell, if your USB Flash Drive is already called _Untitled_ then Steps 5 - 10 are redundant! :) If you go ahead, let me know how you go or if you run into any problems. <comment355496> Got it. Thanks. It's now after midnight here so no way I'm tackling this now. Will give it a go tomorrow. <comment357542> Thank you for asking this question. I had given up on this a long time ago, but followed Monomeeth's answer and it worked for me too. I'm very happy now! <comment357543> Thank you for this answer. I followed it exactly as stepped out and it works!! I'm very happy now!
