Apple Mail App :: "Erase Junk Mail" is greyed out <body> I'm running OS X El Capitan, and have 3 Gmail accounts signed into it. For some reason, the strongErase Junk Mail/strong menu option is greyed out. How can I use this option?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0cRbT.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer212056> This is a sign that Apple Mail's built-in junk mail filtering is turned off. Go into Preferences and select the Junk Mail tab in order to turn it back on again.  <answer212089> It looks like this option is disabled when Apple Mail is set to its default Junk settings.  One of the option groups in the settings panel for Junk is codeWhen junk mail arrives/code. By default it is set to codeMark as junk mail, but leave in my inbox/code.   Changing this to codeMove it to the Junk mailbox/code activates the menu item you refer to.  <answer230173> Go to mailpreferencesjunk mailunder codewhen junk mail arrives/code make sure options #2 codemove it to the Junk mailbox/code is selected and this should fix your problem immediately.   Let me know if you need any help, this is what worked for me after I let my junk mail build up to over 600, which was killing me, I can understand you want it gone!

Any other ideas? <comment256084> Excellent question. Same issue on my mbp. Might have to do with Gmail - Apple Mail folder mappings. <comment256279> I suggest you check out Hoshts's answer, it may well apply to your situation.
