Remove sparse image partition on El Capitan <body> I have a sparse image partition on El Capitan. I am not using FileVault. I've looked at several dozen search results on how to remove the partition, all explaining how to erase the partition and then select it and click the "-" to remove it, but the "-" is grayed.   I've also considered using fdisk from the command line, but the version in OS X does not contain the -l (list) or -d (delete) switches.  How do I delete the sparse image partition?  Youâ€™ll note two sparse disk images in the list. The first of the two is the one that needs to go.  precode/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.1 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:          Apple_CoreStorage Macintosh HD            499.2 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3 /dev/disk1 (internal, virtual):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD           +498.9 GB   disk1                                  Logical Volume on disk0s2                                  663D54A5-31D2-4605-ACC3-4525F5DF1D17                                  Unencrypted /dev/disk2 (disk image):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        +76.8 GB    disk2    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk2s1    2:                  Apple_HFS Apple sparse disk im... 76.5 GB    disk2s2 /dev/disk5 (disk image):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        +76.8 GB    disk5    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk5s1    2:                  Apple_HFS Untitled                76.5 GB    disk5s2  CoreStorage logical volume groups (1 found) | +-- Logical Volume Group 337F10C4-7BD3-48FE-9128-4D26970B9EE0     =========================================================     Name:         Macintosh HD     Status:       Online     Size:         499248103424 B (499.2 GB)     Free Space:   18972672 B (19.0 MB)     |     +-&lt; Physical Volume 716483A7-9980-4666-8E24-C83CB595DD7B     |   ----------------------------------------------------     |   Index:    0     |   Disk:     disk0s2     |   Status:   Online     |   Size:     499248103424 B (499.2 GB)     |     +-&gt; Logical Volume Family 9FACC4F4-789C-4B30-A2BE-F0EA984DB6F0         ----------------------------------------------------------         Encryption Type:         None         |         +-&gt; Logical Volume 663D54A5-31D2-4605-ACC3-4525F5DF1D17             ---------------------------------------------------             Disk:                  disk1             Status:                Online             Size (Total):          498876809216 B (498.9 GB)             Revertible:            Yes (no decryption required)             LV Name:               Macintosh HD             Volume Name:           Macintosh HD             Content Hint:          Apple_HFS         start       size  index  contents           0          1         PMBR           1          1         Pri GPT header           2         32         Pri GPT table          34          6                   40     409600      1  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B      409640  975093952      2  GPT part - 53746F72-6167-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC   975503592    1269536      3  GPT part - 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC   976773128          7            976773135         32         Sec GPT table   976773167          1         Sec GPT header /code/pre  There are two sparse disk images.

Or with other words: a sparse image partition is no physical partition on your hard disk.  Disk images are in fact files which contain a file system which can be mounted, unmounted or even increased or decreased in size. Mounted images usually appear in the file system in /Volumes/. Then they are listed in the codediskutil list/code output but as em/dev/diskX strong(disk image)/em/strong.  Since they are virtual disks they can't be deleted with codediskutil/code on a physical disk. Instead use the Finder. If you don't know where the image file resides but the image is mounted just enter codehdiutil info/code. The image path is listed then:  precode... image-path      : /Users/me/Pictures/ext.sparseimage /code/pre  Now you can delete the image in the Finder or in the shell with coderm .../code.  hr  I think under the hood the app emDisk Utility/em doesn't use codediskutil/code but codehdiutil/code to deal with disk image files. Therefore you can create them but you can't delete them.  <comment320414> These are one (or two?) disk images mounted to /Volumes/ or somewhere else. You have to enter `hdiutil info` to get the path(s) of the dmg(s). Report back please. <comment321001> Hi. Added the requested info. <comment321003> Then unmount `Apple     sparse disk image Media` and delete /Users/me/Documents/ext.sparseimage. <comment321385> That worked, surprisingly, thanks! Why does it require the disk utility to set up, but not the disk utility to remove the partition? Is it that the file system creates the file and the disk utility is only needed to make it mountable? A separate question, I know, but I thought a little explanation here would help the next person.
