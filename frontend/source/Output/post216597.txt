How to create/write file under /usr in OS X 10.11 <body> I was going to compile a php extension using phpize, but it reported some files not found. I googled and found some solutions,      In OS X 10.9, we can make a symbol link from /XCODE_PATH/OS_X_SDK/usr/include to /usr/include   But it seems that OS X 10.11 has some system policy which deny this operation. I even tried to boot in single user mode, but I just got   precode$ sudo ln -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.11.sdk/usr/include /usr/include Sandbox: ln(14) System policy: deny(1) file-write-create /usr/include /code/pre  Anyone knows how to fix this problem? Your answers or comments will be highly appreciated.   <answer216602> You can fight SIP, but probably not for long.
