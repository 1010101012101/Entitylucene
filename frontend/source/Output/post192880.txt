Macbook Pro 2015 Playing 4k videos to a 1440p monitor <body> How does the 15" Macbook Pro 2015 perform playing 4K video to a 1440p monitor? I have a late 2011 model and it really struggles with the downsampling. I'm planning an upgrade and am wondering about video performance.  <answer210953> It's the same. It's laggy at all with my 13" 2015 rMBP and my P2415Q. At 3840x2160 (4k) it is really smooth! Beautiful! 60fps. Downscaling with this mac is a totally mess. Unusable.  <comment254757> Could you explain why you feel the experience on a 13 inch Mac would mirror or track the 15 inch Mac? Many people might argue that the GPU on the 15 model is far superior to the 13 in this case. Also - an edit to explain what specifically is beautiful and what specifically is laggy would help much. I'm not sure what you feel is different (laggy) and what "the same" means. <comment254759> Could you explain exactly what resolution you consider 4k and 1440p by editing that into the post?
