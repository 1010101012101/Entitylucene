How do I permanently allow a website to access my location? <body> In iOS, I only need to be asked once whether I want to allow a website to share my location data. Is it possible to permanently do this in OS X version of Safari as well?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/D9pFu.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer122932> In your Safari preferences   Privacy :   Select strongPrompt for each website one time only/strong   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/knXfZ.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment143500> Thank you so much! I can't believe I missed this :) <comment369861> It appears that this option is not available in Safari 11 on macOS High Sierra ☹️
