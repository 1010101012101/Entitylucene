Replace Text Edit as the default text editor <body> I've seen questions like this which don't quite solve my problem.  I'd like to make Sublime Text 3 the default file viewer/editor for all files that currently use textedit.  Most of these files can be kbdcommand/kbd+kbdi/kbd'd, but the ones that stronghave no extension/strong cannot. They give all sorts of permissions errors such as the ones in this image img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/C7mUK.png" alt="not enough information is available"  Is there any way to just never use textedit, and instead strongset sublime as the default editor for all files/strong?  <answer123834> Set Sublime Text as the default handler for public.plain-text  precodedefaults write com.apple.LaunchServices LSHandlers -array-add \ '{LSHandlerContentType=public.plain-text;LSHandlerRoleAll=com.sublimetext.3;}' /code/pre  This answer is for Mavericks and earlier.br For Yosemite and later, use com.apple.LaunchServices/com.apple.launchservices.secure.  <answer123954> Another option is to use duti (http://duti.org / https://github.com/moretension/duti).   Run codebrew install duti/code, save a filetype like this as:  codeduti -s com.sublimetext.3 public.plain-text all/code  The changes should be applied immediately, so you don't have to restart like when editing codecom.apple.LaunchServices.plist/code.  To also change the default application for executable scripts with no filename extension, add a line like this:  codeduti -s com.sublimetext.3 public.unix-executable all/code  <answer123960> I centralize all my default apps management with Magic Launch. You can configure it to open all codetxt/code with Sublime Text as default without command line (beside, you can change it easily from codeSystem Preferences/code).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EQ7gE.jpg" alt="Magic Launch Preferences" title="Magic Launch Preferences"  One more exceptional useful Magic Launch’s feature is you can set rules based on filename, folders location, which I use intensively to choose different apps for development and writing.  <answer175525> ol liRight click on a .txt file in Finder./li liChoose "Get Info"./li liExpand "Open with:" and choose your preferred text editor in the drop-down./li liPush the "Change All..." button below the drop-down and then confirm in the dialog that pops up with "Continue"./li /ol  This works on Yosemite (OS X 10.10).   <answer186960> Rightclick on the file -- Other -- Choose your favorite text editor (I choose Sublime text in my Applications folder) -- Check the 'Always Open with' checkbox -- Open.  This setting will be automatically applied to all other files in the machine.  No need of any restart or no need of any 3rd party software.  <answer220496> I tried stronggrgarside/strong's solution in the past and I believe it worked.  However, on Yosemite and El Capitan, I ran into problems.  strongDonnaLea/strong's comment in that solution clued me in on creating a solution.  I added the folder path before codecom.apple.launchservices/code additionally the file had a slightly different name codecom.apple.launchservices.secure/code.  You can see the file/folders being modified in the following path:  precode/user/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices/com.apple.launchservices.secure.plist /code/pre  Screenshot for reference: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qQOQg.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Here's the command I used in terminal:  precodedefaults write com.apple.LaunchServices/com.apple.launchservices.secure LSHandlers -array-add \ '{LSHandlerContentType=public.plain-text;LSHandlerRoleAll=com.sublimetext.3;}' /code/pre  Lastly, after a restart to my machine it worked as advertised.  <answer223080> This solution is ripped from a YouTube video, but it works perfectly for my situation (I'm just using Sublime to edit files in languages like Python, Java, and Ruby).  For any particular file, right-click, select "More Info", and click on the "Open with" tab. You can select what text-editor you want here, and use "Change-all" to use the editor for all files of this type. Obviously, this doesn't work for files with no extension, but it's been an easy quick-fix for me.  <answer227145> First do get info on the file that you want to set sublime text as the default. Then go to the open as section and choose sublime. After that press change all then continue on the popup menu and you're doneimg src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/e9xuE.jpg" alt="Instructions part 1"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ulpc1.jpg" alt="Part 2"  <answer248993> The solutions proposed here work perfectly for Sublime, but I wanted to do this for Visual Studio Code. The only difference is that you have to find the "application bundle identifier" for whatever text editor you use. I ran this command:  precode/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c 'Print CFBundleIdentifier' /Applications/Visual\ Studio\ Code.app/Contents/Info.plist  /code/pre  link for reference  to get the identifier "com.microsoft.VSCode". Then I installed "duti" and ran this command:  precodeduti -s com.microsoft.VSCode public.plain-text all /code/pre  This should work for any text editor you want that is installed under /Applications. I hope this helps non-Sublime users.  <comment144647> I wonder if the title of this question should be something like "Replace Text Edit as the default text editor" so that it shows up in searches that don't reference sublime text. <comment144652> @dwightk good point, updated it now <comment144653> do i need to restart after that? <comment144656> @Ross Yes (or log out and back in if not root user). <comment144676> Hmm, so that didn't seem to work for me. (after a full restart.) And I've verified that the entry is in the right location in the launchServices.plist <comment144687> Interestingly, it actually does work if i do `open file2` in terminal or even by double clicking. I thought it wasn't working because if I get info on it, it shows that it opens with TextEdit. <comment149184> Any idea why it doesn't update it in file-info? Would love to update it there as well. <comment149320> @Justin It seems like after another full restart `file-info` now displays that Sublime is the default application. I'm nearly certain that I havn't done anything else to have changed the outcome. <comment207099> This does not answer the question. The question is how to do this for *all* files, even those *without* a file extension. <comment207130> Even if the answer is slightly off topic, it still helped me out from a Google search. +1 <comment207672> wrossmck You are basically right -- my answer even repeats the referred to Q&A in the first line of this question. But I didn't notice this until after I pieced together my answer myself from other answers on this page and posted this answer. Maybe the problem is that searches for the simple answer (i.e. .txt files) lead to this page and not the others (as @Teddy and I found). <comment220880> That doesn't work when there's no file extension. <comment241832> When running running duti against the file I get the error [`line 1: line too long`](http://i.imgur.com/0B0qD7y.png).  I was able to work around it by not using settings file and calling [`duti -s com.sublimetext.3 public.plain-text all`](http://duti.org/duti.1.html) from the cmd line <comment243748> This worked for me. Using `defaults` did not work. <comment246186> Would it work better if you gave the file an extension, or Unhide extension in GetInfo ..? <comment247344> @Zo219 no, some files simply do not have/need extensions, and this question is aimed at setting the default editor, not at using some sub-optimal workaround to achieve a similar result. <comment253722> @grgarside - I don't think this works at all, regardless of the file extension. I don't really blame Hari since this is one of theose basic features that should "just work". Apple has an open bug on it (I filled it years ago, and Apple apparently refuses to fix it). <comment253729> @jww It seems to work great for me for files with extensions—it's how I usually go about changing file associations. <comment259646> On OS X Yosemite I needed to edit ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices/com.apple.launchservices.secure.plist    Whereas the above command created a file ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices.plist which had no effect. <comment266905> Thanks for pointing out that my answer is outdated. I've indicated which versions of OS X my answer works for and provided a link to this answer. <comment270400> This isn't as useful because you'll need to do this on an extension-by-extension basis. The question was looking for a once-and-for-all solution <comment275897> This doesn't work when the file type doesn't have an extension <comment285294> @KyleMit you need an empty line at the end of the file to avoid the line too long error. <comment287201> It worked, thank you! , @Apple:  normal user expects open with & use as default not hidden under all this shit ! <comment295566> This is what I think the easiest way to do it http://www.imore.com/how-change-default-apps-os-x <comment306058> Thanks! Can confirm this to work on El Capitan. No more Text Edit when opening Podfile :) <comment319313> I've used the old command first because I didn't notice the existence of the new plist file (com.apple.launchservices.secure.plist).How can I undo the first defaults write?I suspect that it is responsible for an error I am getting whenever I am trying to use sublime text as a default editor from inside the terminal window. <comment320763> I have sublime text 3 installed but no com.sublimetext.3 preference file: do I need to create one? <comment359863> awesome. kudos to you!
