Trying to get LaTeX work with Anki <body> I'm trying to get LaTeX working on Anki.  I am the only admin on my system but when I try and run the terminal command "tlmgr update --self &amp;&amp; tlmgr install dvipng" I get an error saying I need to run the program as an admin. I am the admin! How do I run this program?   Note:  Due to lack of reputation, I am unable to vote or bump any existing material, so I am asking a new question.  The comment to the top answer is identical to my query, hence the identical text.  How can I get LaTeX working on Anki?  <answer209194> http://ankisrs.net/docs/manual.html#installing-and-assumed-knowledge     Anki’s LaTeX support is not turn-key: it is assumed that you know how to use LaTeX already, and that you have it installed. If you have   no experience with LaTeX, please consult one of the many guides   available on the internet. If you are having trouble with markup,   please ask on a LaTeX forum.      To install LaTeX, on Windows use MiKTeX; on OSX use MacTex, and on   Linux use your distro’s package manager. Dvipng must also be   installed.      Note On Windows, go to Settings in MikTek’s maintenance window, and   make sure "Install missing packages on the fly" is set to "No", not to   "Ask me first". If you continue to have difficulties, one user   reported that running Anki as an administrator until all the packages   were fetched helped.            Note On OSX, LaTeX has only been tested with MacTex and BasicTex. If     you use BasicTex, you need to install dvipng separately, with the     following command:                  strongsudo tlmgr update --self; sudo tlmgr install dvipng/strong               The command may not be on the path, so you may need to provide the     full path, eg /usr/local/texlive/2014basic/bin/x86_64-darwin/tlmgr.         Note If you are not using the above LaTeX packages, you will need to   use the "edit LaTeX" add-on to specify the full path to latex and   dvipng.   Superuser access needed, not just admin.    P.S. It would be great if someone with sufficient rep link this answer to the Apple Stack Exchange question!  Even though we would be quite a few years late to answering user21373 's query :P  <comment252309> There is already an answer to the original question pointing out the need to use `sudo tlmgr`.
