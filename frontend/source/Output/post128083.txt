Microsoft Keyboard not found by Intellitype 8.2 <body> I have a Microsoft Sidewinder X4 keyboard that I use with my Mac, but none of the custom buttons/Media buttons work which is a massive pain, I run OSX 10.9.2 and installed Microsoft Desktop (Intellipoint) 8.2.0 for Mac, But It does not pick up the keyboard! :(  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AFt7b.png" alt="Microsoft Intellipoint 8.2.0 for osx does not work"  What confuses me is that If I navigate to System      Preferences  Keyboard  Modifier Keys   Under the dropbown you can clearly see the Microsoft Sidewinder X4 Keyboard.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pmLbA.png" alt="enter image description here"
