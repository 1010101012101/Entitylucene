Move hard drive from macbook pro to macbook air <body> I have a Macbook Pro with a 250 GB SSD hard drive (Macbook retina Mid 2012 i7) and a Macbook air with 120 GB SSD hard drive (Mid 2012 Intel Core i5).  I would like to move the swap the hard drives if the hardware is compatible. Is this possible? Is it just a matter of opening the machines and swapping the hard drives?  <answer222308> As far as I can see both MacBook's using different SSD's.
