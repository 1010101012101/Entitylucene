Bug - Exporting keynote presentation to HTML <body> I'm having some issues with the export in HTML of my keynote 7 presentation:  1 - All the elements become a little bit blurred (including the typography);  2 - The presentation is not on fullscreen even though my document's size are 1920x1080 in Keynote;  3 - some graphic elements are moving after the export - this is a huge problem!  Please someone can help me? Thanks to all!  <comment322434> Welcome to Ask Different.
