Do Powerbeats2 Use Bluetooth LE (4.0)? <body> Yesterday I bought Powerbeats2 wireless in-ear headphones at Best Buy. I am wondering if they use Bluetooth LE or older Bluetooth technology, such as Bluetooth 2.1.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RVcWy.jpg" alt=""  I've looked on Apple's website and Beats' website, but neither of them provide specs for the headphones.  strongSince Beats is an Apple subsidiary, I am assuming that this question is not off-topic./strong  <answer217354> Yes, it is Bluetooth 4.0. I've been using it for the past one year. Although Beats or Apple website do not provide this information this Engadget article explicitly mentions it.     The PowerbeatsÂ² keep the (albeit modified) hook-over-the-ear design, but liberate heads from handsets via Bluetooth 4.0
