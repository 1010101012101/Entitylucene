How does the Mac choose which connection to use when both Wifi and Ethernet are connected? <body> When I'm connected to two networks with separate routers using Wifi and Ethernet, how does my Mac know what connection to use when I visit a website?  <answer98818> From the Apple Support database article regarding network connection priority:     If you connect to the Internet or a network in several different ways   (using Wi-Fi or Ethernet, for example), you can change the order of   the network port configurations your computer tries when connecting to   the Internet or network.      If there are multiple active network port configurations when you try   to connect, OS X tries the one at the top of the list first, and then   tries the other port configurations in descending order.   In that support article it is also described how you can change the priority order of network connections in System Preferences.  <answer98852> It's in your strongNetwork Preferences/strong. Here's screen shots from 10.7.3.  Access the settings from the gear at the bottom of the network type sidebar.     img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5sxsU.png" alt="enter image description here"  Choose "Set Service Order..." to drag them into the preferred order.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oWkDl.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer98860> I recommand you to never use a configuration where you emmay/em have at the same time different interfaces up on the same machine. You won't have any easy knowledge and control of this dual connectivity.  This may lead to huge difficulties to analyse even the simplest network trouble.  This may also cause loops within company or personnal networks very hard to diagnose. For example, have a look at the following command:  precodesysctl -a | grep forwarding /code/pre  which will show you if codeIPv4/code or codeIPv6/code is going emthrough/em your Mac from one interface through the other without your knowledge or control.  As much as possible define emlocations/em with the interface you know you want to connect to and switch on the right one at will:  precodeApple menu &gt; Location &gt; Home / AirPort                       &gt; Office / Ethernet                       &gt; outside / AirPort [unsecure]                       &gt; … /code/pre  hr When 2 (or more) interfaces (for example codeEthernet/code strongand/strong codeWi-Fi/code) are flagged green (Connected) within:  precodeApple menu &gt; System Preferences… &gt; Network /code/pre  one way to know which one you are taking to reach the outside is the following line command (within a codeTerminal/code or codexterm/code window):  precoderoute get default | grep interface /code/pre  <answer218880> While this is true for some applications, what I experienced when I had connected my iMac to two ISP's - one wifi and another through LAN - applications like uTorrent and Games could apparently use both networks simultaneously. I got more download speed than individual connections and in case of multiplayer games, I could connect to servers with less lag and latency.   <comment116166> If ethernet is higher priority but disabled & Wifi is enabled & connected, what will happen when I plug in to ethernet? Will I disconnect from the network & reconnect? Or stay connected via Wifi? <comment116173> → anotherdave: the Wi-Fi interface will be turned down (equivalent of an `ifconfig en1 down`), and the Ethernet interface will be turned up (equivalent of an `ifconfig en0 up`). If this last one is based on DHCP, this will cause a DHCP request and answer ( 6 s). If any of your interfaces have intermitent drop out, this will lead to an endless interfaces switching and DHCP requests. <comment179918> All the answers explain it on a different level. This one is the best because you can see the changes the computer is making when setting the order through the UI like in the screenshots from @plainclothes <comment211222> This doesn't explain how a user can know **which** interface is **now** used for outgoing trafic, when several interfaces are actives and connected. <comment218151> This doesn't explain how a user can know **which** interface is **now** used for outgoing trafic, when several interfaces are actives and connected. brWith such a configuration the **Wi-Fi** icon in the menu bar may be full black when in fact all your network activity is going through the **Ethernet**! Such a configuration may create a network loop no user will ever be able to see and debug. <comment218217> @danielAzuelos Sure, but that's not the question here. It's about how the Mac chooses, which is a priority based system. If the one on top is working, you're connected. In the main network panel, you can see what interfaces are connected and whether or not it's a successful connection. Cross-ref that with your priority list and you *should* have your answer. <comment264636> BitTorrent was built for multiple connections. But most everything else only uses one connection including games. Want proof? Watch your packets and which interfaces they use. <comment297873> Is ther eany way to route all ssh traffic over wifi and rest over en0 (LAN)?
