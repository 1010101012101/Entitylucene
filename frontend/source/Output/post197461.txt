Does Time Machine backup programs like Photoshop and iWork? <body> I want to upgrade my OS X to Yosemite from Lion and also upgrade my HDD to a SSD but im worried about loosing my programs since I don't have the installers or serial keys. Specifically Adobe cs5 master collection and iWork.   <answer197463> Usually the apps like PhotoShop just come across with all the right licenses.  However, sometimes you must contact the vendor if they have a draconian DRM policy where they are tied to a specific machine / OS.    I'd be very concerned with Adobe if it was a strongnew machine/strong but I've done the upgrade "in place" for Creative Suite at least twice on my MBP 2010.  To upgrade "in place" I just allow the installer to do its thing, and only keep Time Machine in the loop for catastrophes.  If I'm super paranoid I'll take a disk image onto USB using some program like SuperDuper!  <comment236333> Let me know how it turns out, and if your licenses came through.
