Numbers '08: How to create a histogram? <body> I have data (ranging from 0 to 1, e.g.   precode0.61 0.23 0.99 1.0 0.89 0.0 0.42 0.42 0.86  /code/pre  and I would like to create a histogram with bins  precode0    0.2 0.2  0.4 0.4  0.6 0.6  0.8 0.8  1.0 /code/pre  with the upper bin edge inclusive (except for the 0-0.2 bin for which the the lower edge, namely 0) should also be inclusive.  Numbers '09 contains both the COUNTIFS() function and the FREQUENCY() function that have been used in other recipes but neither is available in my oldish copy of Numbers '08.   I am looking for a way to calculate the histogram inside Numbers '08 (instead of me throwing Numbers 08 out and just doing everything in Python...).  (Please note that this is not the same question as the question How to plot a histogram to show occurrence of a certain number using Numbers because in that case no binning is required.)  Thanks for your time. Oliver  <comment149479> I'm thinking throwing out Numbers and doing it in Python is most correct answer I'm afraid. Or upgrading Numbers.
