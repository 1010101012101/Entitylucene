Why can't I jailbreak iPod Touch 4g 4.3.3 (8j2)? <body> Every time I go to jailbreakme.com on my device, the site says "Not supported on your device."  Like I said, I have an iPod Touch 4g, ios 4.3.3. And the site clearly says my version and device is supported. Help please, thank you.  <answer31030> Try going to SettingsGeneralInternational and choose region format "Hawaii United States". Then open www.jailbreakme.com again from Safari.  <answer32467> I found the answer: I was not using Safari.  <comment28531> I found the answer. I was using a different browser than Safari. :) <comment28533> Post it as a real answer using the "Answer your Question" button below!
