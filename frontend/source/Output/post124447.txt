Can I buy an iPhone 5C in the US and use it in Ireland? <body> I'm going to New York soon, and the iPhone 5C is just $99 USD. I am wondering if  an Irish SIM work or if I would have to get it unlocked?  <answer124515> When you buy an iPhone in America for $99 it's probably a SIM-lock together with an subscription. Here you can find the different iPhone 5S models. Search on the internet which Cellular frequencies are used by your provider, and then compare on the site I gave you which models you can use. Mostly the $99 models are locked for AT&amp;T, Verizon,... providers only. So when buying an iPhone in America, make sure you check to model nr on the back of the package.  <answer124570> You can use your iPhone internationally. Just make sure you get one without sim lock (safest bet is an apple store)  It will cost you more than 99$ (That's the price you get with a 2 year contract).  And if you pay tax when importing to ireland, the device will probably cost you about the same.   <comment145577> Would you link to the exact model you are considering buying? The unlocked 5c is your safest bet, and you'll discover that costs much more for several reasons. <comment145579> Most likely if you see a $99 iPhone 5C it includes a 2 year service agreement with a carrier.
