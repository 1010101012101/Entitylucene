iOS got a very long repeating Settings list <body> The application list in codeSettings/code is becoming very long. I can hardly scroll to the bottom. The list might have repeated for more than 40 times.   I don't know how this happened (suddenly or one by one).  I think this is a bug, but I don't know how to reproduce.  The phone is an iPhone 5 with iOS 8.1.3.  As the picture, this app list repeats for about 40 times. I only installed about 20 apps, but it takes me quite a while to scroll to the bottom.  This doesn't affect the usage anyway, just curious.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/u0tfW.png" alt="App List"  <answer196343> Think app list may repeat due to multiple syncing. A restart may sort this.  <comment211483> Same for any iPhone weirdness. Restart. If no joy, in iTunes, Sync; Backup; Restore. <comment211539> Could you post a screenshot? I'm confused what's repeating. The above advice is sound. <comment211590> @Tetsujin I know restart may solve the problem. I just want to know if anyone know how to reproduce it, then we can give Apple a feedback.
