Can I speed up the auto-dismissal of Notification Center banners? <body> I like Notification Center, but banners linger a bit too long before auto-dismissing.  I'm aware of the popular two-finger swipe trick to immediately dismiss a banner, but I'm looking for an automated approach. Growl, for example, let you customize how long notifications stayed on the screen, but I don't see a similar option in the Notifications preference pane.  Is it possible to adjust this, like perhaps through a hidden preference?  <answer64029> Although I never usually have any luck finding them, I used MacWorld's guide, "How to find hidden preference settings", and I was able to find the hidden preference:  precodedefaults write com.apple.notificationcenterui bannerTime &lt;SECONDS&gt; /code/pre  Type the above into Terminal, replacing code&lt;seconds&gt;/code with the number of seconds you want the banner to last for, and press kbdreturn/kbd. Then, log out and log back in to reload Notification Center.  <comment119754> What is the default value? I think there is also a command to erase this setting as well? <comment213304> @cwd The default is `5` seconds.
