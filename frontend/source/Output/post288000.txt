Found old viruses on a computer running macOS Sierra: what to do now? <body> My father was lamenting how random ads will pop-up even with adblock and while browsing trusted websites and how Firefox was always on at startup on his OSX computer (with all software updates correctly on) since the day he installed it.   I naturally checked codeSystem Preferences &gt; Users Accounts &gt; Login items/code and on the Firefox dock icon codeFirefox &gt; Open at login/code. Nothing was there...  So I moved to code~/Library/LaunchAgents/code where to my surprise I've found many files pointing to obvious viruses. For example, one files was named codecom.apple.roinnris.plist/code and was pointing to an executable which, in a Terminal window, behaved like this:  precodeLast login: Mon Jun 26 18:36:28 on ttys000 Pro-di-Gianni:~ gianni$ /Users/gianni/Library/roinnris ; exit; 1.3.4: Initializing... roinnris http://feed.snowbitt.com/?publisher=TingSyn&amp;ts=sy&amp;barcodeid=51222999&amp;searchtype=hp&amp;type=YHS_TGE_5a01fc&amp;_=tt1 http://feed.snowbitt.com/?publisher=TingSyn&amp;ts=sy&amp;barcodeid=51222999&amp;searchtype=nt&amp;type=YHS_TGE_5a01fc&amp;_=tt1 http://feed.snowbitt.com/?publisher=TingSyn&amp;ts=sy&amp;barcodeid=51222999&amp;searchtype=ds&amp;type=TGE_5a01fc snowbitt _Bt3mBZUrWFiQtw-o265327tVlFLedwV5m3RbDQqoTNF34tnUYs4T2-Z-0Vh_ot2iQz9QcQstVbDfh_GhqMjQkak68EeUespftvJPjZ5LY1FbyK8tuMM nth  convertFile - /Users/gianni/Library/backup.zip to /Users/gianni/Library/backup.tmp Ping-"http://t.trkitok.com/track/surl?mid=C26849F2-0F50-5495-9FBB-9269DCE9EDA1&amp;ht=???ڐ?????΄???????ބ??ǅ?????????ؗ??????Č?ٗ?ӌ????????Η??????????????????ϗ?ڌ???ϗ?????????˚??Ɍ???ޛ????ڐ?????΄???????ބ??ǅ?????????ؗ??????Č?ٗ?ӌ????????Η??????????????????ϗ?ތ???ϗ?????????˚??Ɍ???ޛ????ڐ?????΄???????ބ??ǅ?????????ؗ??????Č?ٗ?ӌ????????Η??????????????????ϗ?ٌ???ϗ?????˚??ɠ???????ޠ??ޙ??????????݇Ř???????????????Ǚ????????왞????ٞ??????????ޘ??Г??????????????????????????????????????????????? ?&amp;nt=&amp;su=" /code/pre  Here's another one:  precodeLast login: Mon Jun 26 18:28:48 on ttys000 Pro-di-Gianni:~ gianni$ /Users/gianni/Library/sfhucvkzeooa/sfhucvkzeooa ; exit; 2017-06-26 18:33:10.535 sfhucvkzeooa[10383:98510] http://i.firstinstallmac.club/c/cc?id= /bin/sh: line 50: /Library/pfutil: Permission denied /code/pre  And another one (which was originally in Library but I moved to the desktop):  precodeLast login: Mon Jun 26 18:33:10 on ttys000 Pro-di-Gianni:~ gianni$ /Users/gianni/Desktop/VirusReportStackExchange/jaLeQGoJ/jaLeQGoJ.app/Contents/MacOS/jaLeQGoJ ; exit; 2017-06-26 18:34:37.327 jaLeQGoJ[12743:122843] Found it /code/pre  And another one, with error messages in the user main language (italian):  precodeLast login: Mon Jun 26 18:34:36 on ttys000 Pro-di-Gianni:~ gianni$ /Users/gianni/Library/subtlist/subtlist ; exit; 2017-06-26 18:35:08.919 subtlist[13656:131528] gianni 2017-06-26 18:35:08.920 subtlist[13656:131528] V\(;-&lt;&lt;7,/$48:=6D\TN(&amp;*:1:=."=$UV0)8!'%.+:&lt;=-"&gt;$UV", 694,+?.M    D"1!$&lt;*&lt;!,8#6+'=*&amp;&lt;$D"?28?&amp;&lt;!!$9$ 2017-06-26 18:35:08.921 subtlist[13656:131528] V\(;-&lt;&lt;7,/$48:=6D\TN(&amp;*:1:=."=$UV0)8!'%.+:&lt;=-"&gt;$UV", 694,+?.M    D"1!$&lt;*&lt;!,8#6+'=*&amp;&lt;$UD"?28?&amp;&lt;%6%?&amp;07.M                                                                      N('**-,0*'5&amp;&amp;!'6_       N0&gt;*&lt;!,*,&lt;7'.M                     N('**-,!.8)6= .6_ N('**-,'"&amp;&lt;*'2&amp;;$_"52 ?4;07.MN('**-,'*,&amp;07.MN('**-, &gt;)&amp;07.M                  V"52 ?4&lt;+!&lt;96_N0'8*',-*5512( $ 2017-06-26 18:35:08.921 subtlist[13656:131528] (#-.&lt;=,7$&amp;80=. 2017-06-26 18:35:08.921 subtlist[13656:131528] (&gt;*(10=6"/$ 2017-06-26 18:35:08.921 subtlist[13656:131528] (#*9-76!($7?:46 2017-06-26 18:35:08.921 subtlist[13656:131528] (&amp;8.+&amp;&amp;!'6 2017-06-26 18:35:08.921 subtlist[13656:131528] (19$.*6!4816!'%*4&lt;. 2017-06-26 18:35:08.921 subtlist[13656:131528] (&amp;8.+&amp;24.%-$ 2017-06-26 18:35:08.921 subtlist[13656:131528] (?*8-&amp;6%.%-&amp;:76 2017-06-26 18:35:08.921 subtlist[13656:131528] (?*8-&amp;02''&amp;,!?6 2017-06-26 18:35:08.921 subtlist[13656:131528] (?*8-&amp;!68;67 66 2017-06-26 18:35:08.921 subtlist[13656:131528] (?*8-&amp;&amp; .9&amp;,!?6 2017-06-26 18:35:08.921 subtlist[13656:131528] (?*8-&amp;1:/6 2017-06-26 18:35:08.922 subtlist[13656:131528] (?*8-&amp;'2,40=. 2017-06-26 18:35:08.922 subtlist[13656:131528] (?*8-&amp; &amp;)40=. 2017-06-26 18:35:08.922 subtlist[13656:131528] (?*8-&amp;':&amp;.*-2&gt;;6 2017-06-26 18:35:08.922 subtlist[13656:131528] (?*8-&amp;6!9$+$ 2017-06-26 18:35:08.922 subtlist[13656:131528] (?*8-&amp;52'';8086 2017-06-26 18:35:08.922 subtlist[13656:131528] (&amp;*4,+?. 2017-06-26 18:35:08.922 subtlist[13656:131528] \?

(-2741) /code/pre  I then moved to the main Library (not the user one) at code/Library/LaunchAgents/code and code/Library/LaunchDaemon/code where there were more of these plist files pointing to sketchy executables, one of which was clearely turning Firefox on and trying to compress and steal a folder from it's codeApplicationSupport/code space.  I nuked the contents of all these folders and instructed not to ever use the computer for banking until a full wipe will be done.  All of these files were at least 1 month old.  My questions are:  Are these viruses already known to Apple? If yes, where can I read more and why weren't they automatically removed with Security Updates? If not, who has more informations? Where am I supposed to notify Apple of the existance of these?   <answer288004> Apple contact options are listed on https://www.apple.com/contact/. Security updates are providing patches to known security issues, they usually do emnot/em remove viruses/malware from an already infected systems.   With the suspicious files already gone there is no way to analyze what happened to your father's computer, so you may as well move ahead and reinstall everything from scratch. It's probably safest to use Internet Recovery to reduce the risk of restore from an infected Recovery Partition.  <comment363639> Which of the many questions is the first you want to attack? This reads more like a consulting engagement. Great work on the detail - that will help once we get clarity on which of the many topics to start with. Once you have an answer to the first, we can think about follow up questions. <comment363641> Please add the system version! Also: malicious files are **not** meant to be executed in some suicidal manner! You may do this in a protected VM... Instead post the content of the launch daemon/agents' plist and upload the executable to virustotal or something similar. <comment363642> My question is just one really: which is Apple's policy in regards to this? If the answer is none, then I have multiple questions, which can be roughly summarized in "what the actual f--k?" and too many points to be attacked as a single problem. <comment363644> Version is Sierra to the last update. Those files were already being executed and this computer is about to get nuked anyway. <comment363657> I still have most of the executables though. Forwarding them to Apple right now... hopefully I'll find the time to deassemble and analyze them.
