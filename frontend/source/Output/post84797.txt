How can I get my entire iTunes Match-based music library to appear on my iPhone? <body> I have about 12,500 tracks uploaded to iTunes Match. From my desktop and laptop, everything works great. I can see the cloud-based tracks and play them. I can download them to my machines.  When I turn on iTunes Match and select "Show All Music" on my iPhone the Music app shows me nothing at all. Specifically, it shows me this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VOmPE.jpg" alt="An empty Music app"  I've tried leaving it plugged in, with the Music app open, over night to see if the progress bar fills in a bit and it never does. Not even a little bit.  If I turn off the "Show All Music" option, the Music app shows the tracks I had sync'ed to the device embefore/em I signed up for iTunes Match and put all my tracks in the cloud.  strongHow can I get my entire iTunes Match-based music library to appear on my iPhone?/strong  <answer85053> There could be a corruption in your music library that is preventing the 'sync' to finish.   ol liOn your iPhone, turn iTunes Match off, then open strongSettings/strong  strongGeneral/strong  strongUsage/strong  (wait for usage to populate)  strongMusic/strong   tap strongEdit/strong and then the red remove icon./li liRestart your phone/li liWhen your phone is back on, open strongMusic/strong to ensure its empty.

I tried other solutions for two days, finally resorted to itunes help, and found that very important first step. Nobody else had that as I saw.  <comment97941> Have you previously used iTunes Match with this account on any iOS devices? <comment97949> Yes! It works perfectly on my iPad and my wife's iPhone 5. My wife's iPhone 5 never had any music sync'ed to it before being connected to our match account. The iPad, like my iPhone, did. <comment97950> Deleting my existing music data for the Music app via System - Usage did the trick. Thank you! <comment244612> Unfortunately I had this checked and still wasn't seeing newly-added content on my mobile device. But that's awesome it worked for you!
