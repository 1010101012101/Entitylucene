Is a there a simple solution to avoid problems with hotspots? <body> It seems that codeOSX/code does not behave well with codehotspots/code.  By codehotspot/code, I mean the wireless networks which opens automatically a window for login/password such as  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OEpYi.png" alt="enter image description here"  when you join them.  When you login for the first time to such a codehotspot/code, there is no problem.  The problem occurs when to try connect later. I think codeOSX/code tries something like putting automatically your login/password, but it doesn't work. But the result is that the window to connect never shows up.  I had such a problem few months ago on codeOSX 10.8/code and it was difficult and unclear how to solve it. It involves codekeychain/code and other things.  It seems that this problem still exists on codeOSX 10.9/code.  So strongis there an easy way to avoid these problems?/strong  <answer114257> From your screenshot it looks like your browser is opening (and later failing to open) a login screen in a new window. Try using a different browser.  You might also try   System Preferences - Network - [with "Wi-Fi" selected] Advanced -  uncheck "Remember networks this computer has joined"  and / or  Keychain Access - [with "System" keychain selected] - delete the AirPort network password  <comment138287> No, it's not the browser window. When you connect to such a network, `OSX` automatically opens this window. <comment138421> I'm sure that you are in fact looking at some kind of browser window; check out the URL the bottom of your screenshot, "http://eduspot.inlalco.fr/login?......". You might also try deleting your cookies from your browsers. <comment191239> Mac OS X has built-in functionality to detect hotspot redirects, and will automatically open a window to allow authentication (maybe just a Webkit view?). This is _not_ a part a browser, and as far as I know, there is no way to control this behavior.
