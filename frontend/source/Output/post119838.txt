MySQL and server settings when upgrading Mac Pro from 10.6 to 10.7 <body> I have my web development environment on a mac pro running on OS X version 10.6. I'm considering upgrading it to Mac OS X 10.7.   Will it upgrade smoothly or do I have to reinstall mysql, perl and so on?  I am especially scared for upgrading MySQL and the databases.  To answer remarks here below, I don't remember how I installed MySQL in the first place, but for what I remember, it didn't came out of the box. That's why I am scared it might get removed.   Concerning the os version, I tend to say as close possible to the version that came with the mac at the time. The more recent the OS the more resource hungry they are. I prefer to have a fast mac then an up to date OS. I would stay to 10.6, but there are some applications could help me and are only running on 10.7.  <answer120492> MySQL, as well as the databases, is still there and working after upgrading. This said, all the settings, php, mysql, apache, virtual hosts, where resetted to the default. Very annoying I have to rebuild all my development environment.  <comment139810> Is your current MySQL compatible with Mountain Lion? <comment139816> How did you install MySQL - also what is your reason for upgrading and why not directly to 10.9? or just leave at 10,6 <comment139843> I upgraded my question to answer your questions <comment140524> Usually my MySQL installation works after upgrading. You may want to review your php.ini to correct the position of the MySQL socket (php.ini gets changed by the upgrades). http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/macosx-installation-notes.html
