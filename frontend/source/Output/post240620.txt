Disable Macbook Pro Mic <body> Is there any easy ways to disable the built-in mic? My requirements are  ol liSoftware based/li liDo not need to run every time after login/li liKeep the system integrity protection on/li liRe-enable at needed/li /ol  I have tried LaunchDaemons with simple kextunload on AppleHDA. The results were randomly. Sometimes worked sometimes not. It might work if I add a delay or move it to LaunchAgents but they require more complex setup.  <comment295802> Why? If you can clarify why, we might be able to help you better. <comment295809> Facebook paranoia? see http://www.theverge.com/2016/6/3/11854860/facebook-smartphone-listening-eavesdrop-microphone-denial <comment296997> The major reason is that I use a bluetooth mic on and off. OS X sometimes mess up and use the built-in mic. In combination of the poor quality Skype,  hanging up went wrong sometimes, I prefer totally disabling the mic. Solving other privacy issues are bonus. http://thehackernews.com/2016/04/tape-webcam.html
