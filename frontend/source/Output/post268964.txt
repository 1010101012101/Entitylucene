Homebrew - Somehow it happened there is no executable openssl <body> System Version OS X El Capitan, version 10.11.5  I installed homebrew and rvm. However, when I try to install anything with rvm (ie. rvm install 2.1.1), it says:  precodeSomehow it happened there is no executable 'openssl', run 'brew doctor' and make sure latest '' is installed properly. RVM autolibs is now configured with mode '3' =&gt;   'Allow RVM to use package manager if found, install missing dependencies.', please run `rvm autolibs enable` to let RVM do its job or run and read `rvm autolibs [help]` or visit https://rvm.io/rvm/autolibs for more information. Requirements installation failed with status: 12. /code/pre  When I run brew doctor it says "Your system is ready to brew". I tried to change the path for Open SSL using codeexport PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH/code and then codebrew link --force openssl/code but it still gives me the same error message. When I do codewhich openssl/code it still says it is located here: code/usr/bin/openssl/code.  Any ideas on what I can do to get the openssl to work with Homebrew?

Instead, pass the full include/library paths to your compiler e.g.:   -I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include -L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib Laurens-MacBook-Pro:~ laurensylvain$ which openssl /usr/bin/openssl /code/pre  <answer269489> If you have homebrew  precodebrew install openssl /code/pre  or  precodebrew install openssl --force /code/pre  <answer270523> Had the same issue trying to install 2.3.1 with openssl installed (system and homebrew)  I presume you've already solved it, but here's what just worked for me.  precode$ export LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib $ export CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include $ export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib/pkgconfig $ rvm install 2.3.1 --autolibs=homebrew /code/pre  <answer270648> I've absolutely no idea why this issue happened, but making sure I had the latest OpenSSL worked for me.  precode$ brew upgrade /code/pre  <answer272012> Ran into the same issue (no executable ssl) when trying to install ruby-2.4.0 through rvm (macOS Sierra).  Did brew update and upgrade, as strugee suggested.  Then it complained about missing libraries for /Users/travis/. Needles to say I have no user named Travis. But the precompiled ruby was being downloaded from https://rubies.travis-ci.org.  Therefore I assume something was wrong in the precompiled version of ruby downloaded from that server.  Hope this helps.  <answer273568> I had the issue on MacOS (Sierra 10.12.3) the issue seemed to be that I had installed openSSL via curl (from a previous attempt to install Home Brew) before I had Xcode installed. Here was my fix:  I found the error by running:  precode$ brew doctor /code/pre  It gave me the same output that you received.  I navigated to the directory where openSSL resided, in your case:  precode$ cd /usr/bin /code/pre  From there, I removed the openSSL directory:  precode$ rm -r openssl /code/pre  I then reinstalled the openSSL directory:  precode$ brew install openssl /code/pre  It may be worthwhile to just ensure everything is up to date:  precode$ brew update &amp;&amp; brew upgrade /code/pre  If all is well, try installing ruby again:  precode$ rvm install ruby-2.4.0 /code/pre  If the above doesn't work, another method would be to ensure you have all system requirements by running the following line of code:  precode$ rvm requirements /code/pre  <comment338510> `openssl` is already installed, but hasn't been linked by `brew`. The terminal dump in the question shows the OP attempting `brew link --force openssl` and `brew` complaining that it can't link `openssl`. <comment338513> Please add your system version (eg. 10.12.2) by editing your question or tagging it correctly (e.g. sierra)! <comment341507> I'm currently having a similar issue -- this line seems to be of particular interest:  Libraries missing for ruby-2.3.3: /Users/travis/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.3.3/lib/libruby.2.3.0.dylib. Refer to your system manual for installing libraries  My system doesn't have a directory called /Users/travis nor a user named travis. <comment341844> I was surprised this worked for me after all the other solutions did not. <comment342409> 'brew upgrade' is what I was missing and fixed this for me. Thanks
