Can't get icon off of menu bar on mac <body> I downloaded Fitbit onto my computer and then deleted all of it, but I can not get the icon to delete from my menu bar. I have tried to drag it over so it will delete, but it will not move.  <answer251174> If you have the Fitbit Connect installer software the Downloads folder on your computer, just run the Uninstall Fitbit Connect.app:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oyNKJ.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  If you don't have the installer, download a new version here, then run the Uninstall app.  It is also a good idea to reboot after the uninstall process completes.  <comment312125> Do you mean the dock, at the bottom of the screen, or the menu bar, at the top of the screen? <comment312126> The menu bar at the top of the screen. <comment312127> Did you uninstall it using the FitBit uninstall application or did you just delete the icon?  I've seen where you need to [use the uninstaller application](https://community.fitbit.com/t5/Fitbit-com-Dashboard/Fit-bit-flex-icon-on-Mac-Book-menu-bar/m-p/342212) in order to remove the icon from the menu bar. <comment312132> Everything has been deleted though. I try looking it up in downloads and it is gone. <comment312139> I redownloaded it and the used the Uninstall and it worked. Thank you so much for your help! <comment312156> If it worked, mark my answer as the solution! <comment312212> My answer was the correct one - please mark it as the solution!
