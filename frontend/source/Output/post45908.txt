How do I use piano pedals in Garageband? <body> I created a new piano project in Garageband. When I click the on-screen keyboard, it plays notes. On a normal piano, one of the pedals causes notes to continue playing even after they are released (I believe they eventually begin to slowly fade away). How can I get this same effect in Garageband?  <answer45911> The kbdâ‡¥ Tab/kbd key functions as the sustain pedal in the on-screen keyboard, if you switch to the Musical Typing mode:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/h67rf.png" alt=""  If you must use the Keyboard mode, you can insert pedaling after the fact in the Score editor:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/joAZP.png" alt=""  <comment52328> Is there any way to use the pedal in the other mode? <comment52335> Not as easily, but sure (edited my answer).
