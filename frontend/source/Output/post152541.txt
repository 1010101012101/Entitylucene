Uninstalling OSX 10.10 Yosemite Extensions <body> I'm a developer, but it is more of a user-centric question.  How can one "unregister" a Finder Sync (or any other, presumably) OSX 10.10 App Extension?   I've removed the app that's hosting it (FinderSynctest), but it still shows here:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Al5zO.png" alt="How to remove 10.10 Application Extension"  <answer152563> I found my extensions in:  precode/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/ShareKit.framework/Versions/A/PlugIns /code/pre  Delete FinderSyncTest.appex, restart Finder, and it should be gone.  <answer155689> Did you create this extension yourself?   I found that after creating, building, and testing an extension I created that there was some data that lives here:   precode/Users/*username*/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData /code/pre  that I needed to blow away to get the extension to "die"  <answer188177> Another answer in addition to my previous one: if your extension is actually runnable (i.e.: it doesn't crash when started via System Preferences - Extensions), find the extension in your Activity Monitor, double click the process, then go to the "Open Files and Ports" tab. You'll see the path of your extension listed.  <comment179747> Unfortunately, this is not the case here. <comment179902> Try running "locate FinderSyncTest" from Terminal. Good chance you'll find where the extensions are located. <comment305292> It didn't work for me for my project..... Any other way to find? <comment305293> Yes I created my own, but it does't exist there, I removed all the files in DerivedData, but still see whole bunch of extensions.
