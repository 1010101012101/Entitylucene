Difference Between OSX fork() and BSD fork() <body> What is the difference between OSX fork() and BSD/Linux fork()?  After browsing some erratum it appears on OSX fork() suspends the parent process, doesn't allow the child to inherit global vars, etc.   However, I didn't find anything definitive on the Apple Developer manpage.  Please help!  <answer257108> It appears the OS X warns under caveats that it would be considered unsafe to use any API or global variable in context of child process.  I would assume the same unsafe condition in BSD - but it is not mentioned.  References:  BSD Fork  OSX Fork
