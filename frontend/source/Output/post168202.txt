Airplay doesn't show up until airport express is restarted <body> Since a little while, I always need to restart my airport express for airplay to show up on my computers.  I use my airport express solely for the airtunes feature, and actually use a different wifi router that both my computer and airport express connect to.  Is this a known issue? Are there any sort of recommendations out there to make this better?
