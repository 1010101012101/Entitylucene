How do make iOS autosave received iMessage photos? <body> I want to make sure all photos I receive in iMessage are saved to Photos app.  How do I change this settings?  <answer260219> This is currently not possible. You can bulk save images from a conversation in Messages by opening the conversation details, holding down on an attachment, selecting More, then choosing the photos you want to save and pressing the Save button.  <comment325695> .....Sad face :( <comment335460> Interestingly WhatsApp still autosaves received photos
