How to put a application in fullscreen using shell command in Mavericks? <body> I would like to ensure a application is running in fullscreen using a shell command (or script). I've seen some approaches that tell the application to execute a keyboard shortcut (codecmd/code+codectrl/code+codef/code) but that will toogle the fullscreen mode, not ensure.  <answer139071> Here's an AppleScript that can do it. Pass codetrue/code or codefalse/code to switch mode. The script uses the value of codeAXFullScreen/code to determine whether the app is currently in full screen and will only switch if necessary.     pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codeToggle an application from full screen to non full screen (or the reverse). Parameters:   1: application name(ie, Chrome)   2: boolean (true/false).      When true ensure that the application is in full screen mode (if not, make it so)      When false ensure that the application is NOT in full screen mode (if not, make it so) /code/pre   pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codeon run argv   set theapp to item 1 of argv     if item 2 of argv is "false"     set toggleOnFull to true     else     set toggleOnFull to false     end if    tell application theapp     activate     delay 2     (*        Initially from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8215501/applescript-use-lion-fullscreen     *)     set isfullscreen to false     tell application "System Events" to tell process theapp       set isfullscreen to value of attribute "AXFullScreen" of window 1     end tell     --display dialog "var " &amp; isfullscreen      if isfullscreen is toggleOnFull then       tell application "System Events" to keystroke "f" using { command down, control down }       delay 2     end if   end tell end run /code/pre  supSource: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/dsummersl/4175461/raw/36811eab78ca5e1a25fbd547a44b3d9c8d0d424d/makeFullScreen.applescript/sup  <comment164212> Hi @george-garside, I've tried the script with no success. I'm on Maverick and I get this error: `makeFullScreen.applescript:787:792: execution error: System Events got an error: osascript is not allowed assistive access. (-1719)` when running from CL `osascript ~/Desktop/makeFullScreen.applescript HipChat true`. I've added Chrome to the accessibility apps in the OSX settings, but I get the same error. Any ideas? <comment164251> @dome You need to give osascript assistive access: run `sudo sqlite3 /Library/Application\ Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db "INSERT or REPLACE INTO access VALUES('kTCCServiceAccessibility','/usr/bin/osascript',1,1,1,NULL)"` <comment164257> Done that, I can see it adds the osascript in the pref panel, but after all I still get the same error: `osascript ~/Desktop/makeFullScreen.applescript HipChat true` `/Users/am/Desktop/makeFullScreen.applescript:787:792: execution error: System Events got an error: osascript is not allowed assistive access. (-1719)` <comment164450> If someone got this working I would mark it as correct, but for some reason it doesn't work for me. I must be missing something here :/
