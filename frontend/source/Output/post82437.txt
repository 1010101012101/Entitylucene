Various graphics-related corruption/errors/misrendering with Mountain Lion <body> Since the November 2012 update to Moutain Lion, I keep getting these weird graphical issues.  The list of woes:  h2OpenCL crashes during application startup/h2  Sometimes after the laptop wakes up from a long sleep, when trying to launch any applications, they all crash with the following kind of stacktrace exhibiting a problem in CoreImage/OpenCL:  precodeCode Type:       X86-64 (Native) Parent Process:  launchd [136] OS Version:      Mac OS X 10.8.3 (12D68)  Crashed Thread:  0  Dispatch queue: com.apple.main-thread  Exception Type:  EXC_BAD_ACCESS (SIGSEGV) Exception Codes: KERN_INVALID_ADDRESS at 0x000000010c8d0000  VM Regions Near 0x10c8d0000:     shared memory          000000010c8c0000-000000010c8d0000 [   64K] r--/r-- SM=SHM   --&gt;

Since I have FileVault turned on, I also can't seem to be able to boot into safe mode to flush the icon caches manually (same 25-30% stuck loading bar problem than described elsewhere).  Cleaning whatever other codeCaches/code folder I can find doesn't help either.  strongNow/strong, the interesting thing is that problem 1 and problem 3 are both circumvented with a simple action: running the application manually from a terminal (as in, not via codeopen(1)/code i.e. not with codelaunchd/code as the parent process).  In that case the icons renders perfectly and there is no weird OpenCL crash for the lifespan of that instance although it doesn't fix the problem for normally launched applications afterwards.  As I scouted the internet I couldn't find people with precisely the same set of issues so it could simply be that my machine is faulty but I'm posting here beforehand to see if anyone else has more ideas on how to diagnose the problem (and to provide a Google entry-point for it).  <answer103583> I have just experienced the same problem. I noticed graphic artefacts on my desktop, but did not worry about it until Transmission failed to start. Couple of iterations later I restarted it from iTerm (thus bypassing launchd), and it worked. I shrugged shoulders and rebooted - now that was a mistake.  Pretty much all apps that use default MacOS windows rendering engine could not start, including Finder. This meant I could not start iTerm or Terminal either. The likes of Chrome, VLC, Sonos and iTunes, which use their own window renderer, worked. I got a very similar stacktrace all the time bar the last call - not strdup, but memmove, also from stdlib. Surprisingly enough, when I tried to log in as another user, everything still worked.  I tried resetting SMC and PRAM to no avail. Then I rebooted in safe mode, in which rendering worked, and rebooted back to the normal mode. This helped. At least I can launch apps now - but Finder crashes and relaunches every now and then occasionally.  <comment99331> I'm just going to add that I'm experiencing this too on 10.8.3 and I'm almost 100% sure it's caused by installing the rMBP 2.0 update. I was able to "fix" this issue by re-installing 10.8.2, which removed the rMBP 2.0 update. I started on 10.6 with a MBP, and haven't done a clean install since, so I'm currently in the process of preparing to do a clean install, with the assumption that something I did over the years is interfering to trigger the crash. Hopefully that permanently fixes the issue. <comment105337> Did you ever figure this one out? Experiencing the same problems. <comment119599> I have the exact same problem. If you disable hibernation and only use sleep mode and login into safe mode once the problem seems to go away. At least until you go into hibernation and wake back up in my experience.
