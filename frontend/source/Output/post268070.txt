Microsoft Remote Desktop - application windows size <body> When I use RDP to a WIndows 7 machine from WIndows 7, the window open behavior is what I"m used to.   WHen I use MS Remote Desktop from OS X all aplications that were already open are fiull screen - not mximized - and any new windows I open open full screen (again, not maximized).  I have been searching for a solution to this not only because of my preference to be able to see multiple windows at the same time. As you may know, it is difficult to go anywhere near the top of the screen in an OS X full screen window without triggering the auto-hidden taskbar. I spend an inordinate amount of time in the RDP session dragging windows so I can get a corner to resize, triggering the taskbar, waiting for it to auto hide again, then resuming my work on resizing windows on client computer.  Searches for this have only led to discussions on maximizing/not maximizong the remote desktop session window, or screen resolution settings for the RDP session window.  Anyone else know what I am talking about?  <comment336456> 'screen resolution settings' might just be it... Windows has a nasty habit of full-screening windows if the screen res is small. Are you using 'fit session to window' & 'default for this display' ?
