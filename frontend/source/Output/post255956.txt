Archiver is giving me an error "Couldn't copy unpacked files from working directory" <body> I'm getting this error when trying to unzip a compressed file - why? How do I get around it?  I haven't had this issue before. I'm on OSX 10.8.3 img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oEhr9.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment319003> Do you get a different error if you use Finder and select the archive and use the space bar to bring up a quick look preview? There should be an **uncompress** button that uses Apple's tool to unzip the file. <comment319004> This seems not to be the OS X built-in archiver. What software are you using? Is it only a particular file? <comment319005> maybe the file ist encrypted and Archiver cannot handle with it? Load from the App Store **The Unarchiver** and try with it. <comment319014> I've been using the built-in Archiver that came with my Mac, and am able to open other zipped files. I tried the Finder/space bar method and got the same error as before. I updated my OS to 10.8.5 and tried again, and tried converting to archiver and rar format, and got an error that the files may be corrupt. However, I'm able to unzip the file no problem on the Windows side of my computer. Why would that be? Thank you so much for your help!! <comment319017> I was able to unzip using The Unarchiver, but when I tried to open the extracted folder I get the error "file can't be opened because you don't have permission to see it's contents" ?!?!? I have no problems on the Windows side though!
