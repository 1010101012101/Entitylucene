Can't reinstall OS X 10.9.5 Mavericks <body> I updated a 2009 MacBook to OS X 10.9.5. It was running a version of 10.9, but I don't recall which one. After the update, commands like codels/code went missing. I tried a emRepair Permissions/em via Disk Utility, but it was no help. I'm guessing it was a botched update.  I'm trying to perform a reinstall emwithout/em the DVD. I'm following Reinstall OS X Without CD/DVD or Apple ID (but I have the Apple ID). I boot with kbdCMD/kbd+kbdR/kbd and I jump through all the hoops.  At the final install step, I receive an error strongemThe item is temporarily unavailable. Please try again later/em/strong. I've been trying to do this for the last 2 hours or so, so I'm guessing its not going to be available anytime soon.  I found one previous question for The item is temporarily unavailable. Please try again later. Unfortunately, none of the answers really provide instructions on how to proceed. They are more like guesses at what could be wrong, and prayers hoping things will correct themselves.  How do I proceed?  hr  I have two MacBooks. One is the MacBook discussed above, and the other is a MacBook Pro. Both of them are now broken due to Apple processes. I emreally/em need one of them to work.  <comment266426> Are you able to reinstall from the App Store? Under purchases the OS should appear. <comment266447> Most common cause of `ls` not working would appear to be that the path was overwritten.
