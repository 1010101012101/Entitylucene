How to access data on a pc from a mac which are in different network group <body> I am trying to access data from a pc which is in the network, however not in the same network group. Remote desktop works fine, but how can I access and enable transferring  data?  I am using OSX 10.8.6 and the pc is running windows 7.  <comment122594> OS X 10.8.6 ? I thought 10.8.5 was the latest update!! <comment122655> Sorry, was just a typo! Of course 10.8.5
