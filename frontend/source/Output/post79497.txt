Offsite backup of Time Capsule <body> I use the CrashPlan software to run backups of my NAS to an offsite machine.  I'd also like to use it for backing up a Time Capsule to the remote machine.  How do I do this so I don't impede Time Machine's backups?  My Time Capsule is a disk on a Mac Mini Server that backs up an MBP.  I've tried backing up the file codeTime Machine Backups/Backups.backupdb/code to a remote machine with CrashPlan, but this causes Time Machine on the connected clients to stop working.  How can I backup a Time Capsule?  <answer79498> Time Capsule supports copying backups stored on it to an external USB-disk (put in the USB-port on the device).  You need to trigger it through the Airport Tool.  After copying the copy can be used as a Time Machine disk when restoring files or reinstalling OS X.  (I do not use the TC as a network disk, so any files stored there, must be manually copied)
