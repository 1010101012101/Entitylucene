How can I store edited pictures with iPhoto for iPhone? <body> Im a bit surprise about few things in IPhoto for iPhone.  1) I cant create albums or group pictures into events. Is it true?  2) Once Ive dited few photos there isnt an easy way to save them i to my photo library. in the share menu, there is "Camera Roll", however it allows you the export 1 picture per ime (differently from other sharing options) and it takes ages.  This is not the same behavior I have on iPhoto for mac: when I edit a pic on mac the edited pictures replace the original ones (and they are automatically stored in my photo library and shared among all devices).  Thanks Patrick  <answer49378> You can create albums directly on the iPhone.  ol liGo into Camera Roll/li liClick the share icon in the upper right corner/li liSelect all the photos you'd like to add to a new album/li liSelect "Add To" and then "New Album"/li /ol  When it comes to edited images I guess it depends on how you edit them. Most programs offer to save a new copy of the image and thus keep the original and new one. I guess it's possible that some programs also offer to replace the original. Regardless, when you create new albums just choose the edit image.
