Display a text message on macOS Desktop background <body> I would like to display a message, for example, the OS Version, the installed tool versions etc on the Desktop background of macOS.  I understand that the lockscreen text can be edited, I am not talking about that. That is not what I am interested in.  I know there is a way because I have seen my colleagues at my previous job do this.  NOTE: I want to do this from command line.  <answer285379> It is possible using NerdTool or GeekTool. You can create custom ones writing command line codes or display content from logs.img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0DyE9.png" alt="enter image description here"  Find inspiration for code from here and mac AppStorm made a great article with lots of crazy geeklets .
