iPhone restarts every three minutes after screen replacement <body> I recently just replaced my screen on my iPhone 4s and everything works fine! But every three minutes my phone will go black and restart again I was wondering if anyone might know at all?  However my phone is saying it's got 100% power :/   <comment162948> This doesn't help you much but I'd guess that it isn't actually your iPhone that is restarting, just Springboard crashing. Springboard is the application on iPhone that draws the home screen and controls the server that draws everything to the screen. If you go into Settings and go to "General" - "About" - "Diagnostics & Usage Data" you should see files called something like Springboard_2014-07... That would confirm it is Springboard crashes. Copying and pasting the content of the most recent of them might help us diagnose the issue. <comment162997> Hi I'm gonna try this, however after I posted this question I had my phone on charge after taking it off it appeared to be on 1%  even tho said it was on 100% so maybe thinking now it's a battery problem. <comment163026> Also the diagnostics say something about " panic.ips"  there's few of them logged. <comment163062> The panic files should have a timestamp on them. Do the times line up with the times your phone restarted? If so, then it seems like the entire OS is restarting rather than just one piece of the OS. It might be an idea to update your phone, back it up and then restore it. Following this guide: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4137 <comment163084> Have tried that but when doing so it stops at when it starts to do firmware and then pops up saying " unknown error (29)" <comment163092> You should probably take your iPhone to the nearest Apple Store or contact [Apple Support](https://www.apple.com/support/contact/). It sounds like something is seriously wrong with it. According to [this](http://support.apple.com/kb/TS3694#10) Error 29 means "your device or computer may have a hardware issue that's preventing the update or restore from completing".
