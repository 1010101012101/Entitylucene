How to update Mac OS X 10.6.8 to 10.7 <body> I have Cienega on my Mac and did a recent update.  Since the update I'm not able to open in Applications Cienega.  I'm receiving a error message that says  I have Mac OS X 10.6.8. The application requires Mac OS X 10.7 or later.  How do I upgrade?  <answer98872> Go to the App Store and find OS X Mountain Lion over there. Click download and run it.  <answer98878> Mac OS X Lion (10.7) was removed from the Mac App Store with the release of Mountain Lion in the summer of 2012. Therefore, your only legit option for purchasing a copy would be to look for someone selling a new USB version of the OS (instead of releasing Lion on a DVD, as they had with previous updates, Apple released it on a small USB flash drive). You can try eBay, they seem to have a few up for grabs. You could find somewhere else to download it, or find a friend who has the USB version and borrow it from them, but that would be illegitimate.  <answer107820> Apple has started selling OS X Lion redemption codes,  for Â£14 (in the UK) so you can still buy the old OS if you need to.
