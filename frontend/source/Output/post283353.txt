How to rename osascript in the administrator privileges dialog? <body> I have used the command.  precode/usr/bin/osascript -e 'do shell script "echo hello args 2&gt;&amp;1 etc" with administrator privileges' /code/pre  It asks for password saying osascript want to make changes. What I want is, how do I change the word emosascript/em?  <answer283357> Assuming either El Capitan or Sierra is installed, first disable SIP and boot to your main system again.  Open Terminal and enter:  precodesudo ln /usr/bin/osascript /usr/bin/butterfly /code/pre  Enable SIP again.  Now embutterfly/em will ask to make changes after entering  precode/usr/bin/butterfly -e 'do shell script "echo hello args 2&gt;&amp;1 etc" with administrator privileges' /code/pre  Instead of embutterfly/em you can use almost any other name. The name shouldn't be the name of an executable already existing on your Mac (especially it strongmustn't/strong be one already existing in your PATH).  So emls/em or emdiskutil/em is a big NoNo but emnecyria_bellona/em is OK.  <answer294568> The above methods all require administrator privileges in the first place, but if you are trying to do this as part of a bash script you want to distribute without requiring administrative privileges or extra setup, you could do something like the following:  precodeTMP=$(mktemp -d) pushd "$TMP" &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 /usr/bin/butterfly -e 'do shell script "echo hello args 2&gt;&amp;1 etc" with administrator privileges' -o 'My Cool Name.app' 'My Cool Name.app/Contents/MacOS/applet' popd rm -rf "$TMP" /code/pre  This will create a temporary directory, compile the script as an applet, execute it and then delete the temporary directory and applet.  <comment357220> You can also just make the hard link to a location that doesn't need the use of `sudo` or disabling SIP. Then use the hard links pathname.
