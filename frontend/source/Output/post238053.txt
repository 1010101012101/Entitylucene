MacBook Pro intermittently won't let me login after sleep <body> I am occasionally running into problems where I can't login after sleep.  Sometimes I open the lid of my Macbook Pro and it shows the usual login screen, but if I type my password in and click enter it just hangs on the screen. After a few seconds, my cursor starts "beach-balling" but still moves around the screen when I use the trackpad.  I have a Macbook Pro 13" Early 2011 running OS X 10.11, El Capitan. I wanted to speed it up so I decided to add a Mercury ExtremeÂ® Pro 6G SSD (240 GB), next to the 1TB HD I already have in it.  I noted that the 6G models only work reliably in the original disk slot, not where the Super Drive used to sit. I followed guides to put the SSD in the HD's spot and how to install the OWC Data Doubler with the HD. When I installed Mac OS X onto the new SSD, I decided to use FireVault for more security.   h2Boot Drive/h2  When booting up, the computer has decided to boot off of the Old Mac OS X partition on the HD instead of the SSD (I have selected the book disk in System Preferences)  ul liIs this a known problem?/li liCould it be the cable to the SSD?/li /ul  strongEDIT 1:/strong After restarting and looking at console, there are no entries/events appearing in it at the time of the sleep wake error  <comment291783> Did this problem appear after adding the SSD? Have you tried discovering why the SSD is not being used as the boot drive? <comment291784> @GrahamMiln It is being used as the boot drive most of the time, I have seen it randomly decide to boot from the HD a few times
