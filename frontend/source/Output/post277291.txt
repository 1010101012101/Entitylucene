Spotlight search in El Capitan: increase window WIDTH <body> Is there a plist hack or something like that, or an alternative interface perhaps, to increase the strongWIDTH/strong of the Spotlight search window in El Capitan?  I would like to run searches similar to "kind:pdf emkeyword/em" and quickly visually scan the resulting documents. But, ridiculously, Spotlight insists on showing only a tiny, narrow preview.   Please do not comment on how to change the strongheight/strong of the window.  Please do not mention Alfred.  A broadly similar question was asked for older versions of OSX: How to increase size of the Spotlight search results window? Nothing useful there.
