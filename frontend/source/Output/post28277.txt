Which iOS and Lion third-party apps support "Documents in the Cloud"? <body> Which apps in iOS and Lion support the "Documents in the Cloud" feature from iCloud? I know that Apple's own iWork apps support this. But other than Apple's own apps, which third-party apps implement this?  It would be helpful to know the name of the app as well as how it uses "Documents in the Cloud". For instance:   ul liPages, it allows you to save your documents/li liInstacast, keep last listened to position in podcasts in sync. /li /ul  One app per answer, please, to keep the results focused. Please check before you answer, duplicate answers will be deleted.  <answer28647> ul liI use strongSigleText/strong (website | App Store link | MAS link) to share notes between my iPhone and my Mac; it uses iCloud storage./li liAs far as I know, strongiTunes Movie Trailer/strong app and strongDoodle Jump/strong app use iCloud storage to sync your settings between iOS devices./li liWorth to mention: strongInstacast/strong. The last version sync your podcasts (played status, favorites, resume playing location) thanks to iCloud. The developer said is going to launch an iPad version, so this feature should be very handy in the future./li /ul  <comment32475> Converted to Wiki <comment32799> Is no-one answering this for any reason?
