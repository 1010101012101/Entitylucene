On reboot system asking for keychain password for local items <body> I reinstalled OS X Yosemite, I am now using a new admin password (I also changed my iCloud account password.) Upon setting up iCloud, it reused the iCloud data.  Everything is running fine BUT on each reboot I am asked to enter the "old iCloud password" for all system agents using the "Local Items".   precode___________ wants to use the "Local Items" keychain. Please enter the keychain password /code/pre  and it only accepts my old iCloud password, not the new one ...    <answer177470> Keychain password &amp; login are only the same until you change one, then you need to change the other separately  Source: OS X: Keychain Access asks for keychain "login" after changing login password     Note: This doesn't happen if you change your account password using Accounts preferences.br   If you want your default keychain to be unlocked automatically when you log in, synchronize your Keychain Access and account login passwords by doing this:      ul   liOpen Keychain Access (you can get to it by choosing Utilities from the Go menu in the Finder).  /li   liFrom the Edit menu, choose Change Password for Keychain "login."/li   liType the former password of the account that you are currently logged in to, then click OK./li   liIf you entered the correct password, a new window appears; enter the original password again in the Current Password field./li   liIn the New Password field, type the password that matches your current account password./li   liRe-enter the newer password in the Verify field, then click OK./li   /ul   <answer230415> I am amazed how much hassle changing my Apple ID password causes me, but the solution I've used for this is from Npalamidis on the Apple forums:     1.- Opening KeyChain appbr   2.- Locking the Keychain by clicking the lock on the top left corner.br   3.- Unlocking the Keychain, as soon as I typed my Admin Password it asked me to "Reset my iCloud KeyChain" I clicked yes because I didn't   have setup my icloud keychain yet.br   4.- Restart computer.br   After performing this steps the computer restarted flawlessly and without    asking for the "Local Items" password.     I locked and unlocked all the keychains because there wasn't one listed called "local" but following Tetsujin's answer I'll try just the login one next time.  <answer262633> The other solutions didn't work for me.  For the first one, changing the keychain password, I found the keychain was using the right password, so I was changing the right password... with the right password? It still used the old password on restart.  Then I saw another keychain called 'Local Items' and I thought that might be it, I clicked it, unlocked it and it disappeared (all fairy tale like). Then I didn't know what to do; the second solution didn't work under any circumstance, the icloud keychain simply wouldn't lock.  What worked for me was to codereset the keychain from Keychain Access &gt; Preferences/code, which is fine since you get a backup of your old keychain.  After resetting I codechanged the password of the new keychain/code and Voilla! it was finally the old pesky password getting changed. Now all is good!
