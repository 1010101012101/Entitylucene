Can I attach 2 dual-DVI screens to a Radeon 5870? <body> The card (ATI Radeon HD 5870 1024 MB) has 1 dual-DVI port and 2 mini display ports.  http://i.imgur.com/iUOawq6.jpg  The dual-DVI is hooked up to a 30" 2560x1600 Dell screen. I also have a 27" 2560x1440 screen. Can I hook this new screen up to one of the display ports? Is there a way to get both screens working? Both screens are Dual-DVI only - no other hookups. thanks  <answer86754> Apple Store: Mini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI Adapter or similar.  <comment100250> I am seeing that the ports on the 5870 are indeed display ports.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mini_DisplayPort_on_Apple_MacBook.jpg  According to the Wikipedia page, they support up to 2560x1600. That means they might work on my Mac, but I have not seen any definitive confirmation that it will work well. <comment100312> Yes that should work. And if not, you might have to connect 1 of the screens via DisplayPort and the other via a DVI-to-USB adapter.
