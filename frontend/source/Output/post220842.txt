OSX Services - character substitution + for _ <body> I've created a service to use primarily in a browser for searching IMDB, so instead of copying and pasting the film's name I just select the text and run the service I created which will automatically search IMDB for the selected text. This works perfect.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nFiCD.png" alt="enter image description here"  I was hoping to do the same for Wikipedia and so i've been trying to modify the same service but have come across a problem. The search query places a "+" between each word.  This doesn't work for Wikipedia. They place underscores between their words.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cOnNJ.png" alt="enter image description here"  I wondered how I can substitute the + for _? This is what I currently have  precodeopen "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/$(ruby -rcgi -e 'print CGI.escape $&lt;.read.chomp')" /code/pre  Kinds regards and Merry Christmas :)  <answer220844> precodeopen "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/$(ruby -rcgi -e 'print CGI.escape $&lt;.read.chomp' | sed 's/+/_/g')" /code/pre  codesed 's/+/_/g'/code replaces all instances of + with _  <answer220845> WikiPedia places underscores for its entry URLs, but you can codesearch/code any string (actually with spaces) with this URL scheme:  codehttp://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=[query]/code  Replace code[query]/code with you search query.  Try this for example: Search for "stack overflow"  It redirects to correct page. If it can't determine which entry to show, it shows a list of possible entries you can select from: Search for "stack overfloww".  strongTL;DR/strong  Moreover, if you separate words in query with code+/code, it works just fine. So all you need to do is replace   precode                               ↓↓↓↓↓↓ open "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/$(ruby -rcgi -e 'print CGI.escape $&lt;.read.chomp')" /code/pre  with this:  precode                               ↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓ open "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=$(ruby -rcgi -e 'print CGI.escape $&lt;.read.chomp')" /code/pre  <comment267350> @Frasier013 Since we're on the subject, [this](http://www.macosxtips.co.uk/keysearch/) is a great Safari extension for searching in different sites from the address bar.
