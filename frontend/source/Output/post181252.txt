Why can't I skip ahead on a song or podcast in iTunes? <body> All of a sudden, while playing a song on the itunes store or a podcast on the podcast store, I can't skip ahead to a specific time.   When I click ahead, the cursor reaches that location, then immediately pulls back and fast forwards the play location by about 5 seconds.   This is extremely frustrating and is seemingly happening out of no where.  <comment215530> Are the songs saved locally or is it happening on files from cloud/iTunes match, etc.? <comment215544> It was happening on the store. However once I downloaded the podcast it let me skip anywhere I chose. I do remember it allowing me to skip to anywhere while still in preview though. <comment215547> Sounds like a networking issue. When you play a song in the store does it immediately start playing or do you have to wait? What's your result on a speed test? <comment215548> It plays instantaneously. <comment215587> I've found similar on YouTube videos. Workaround is to pause playback, skip to where you want, start playback. <comment215699> Tried that. When I do that, it goes back to original location in time when pressing play on the video.
