I can't download El Capitan from App Store <body> I think the title is pretty selfdescribing, but ok :)   I go to App Store, I click on download button on OS X El Capitan (it is listed under Utilities), and nothing happens and the El Capitan is not downloaded, nor does it change the status to "Downloading". I don't think it is downloading. I also tried to log in as root to the mac and now the App Store won't work - it keeps spinning the spinner sign and nothing happens, I can't even type the letters "El Capitan" in the search box). Anyone has any other link , URL for downloading of El Capitan other than the one on App Store? Losing my faith in Apple slowly...... I am on Macbook 7.1 (Mid-2010).  <answer229711> I restarted the computer, and tried again, solved the problem.
