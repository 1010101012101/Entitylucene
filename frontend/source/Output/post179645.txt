Allow system to sleep even with audio stream running <body> For a bit of background info: I have a 2010 MacBook Pro 15 with OSX 10.10.2 installed.  I'm looking to make the laptop go to sleep even when a proccess that sets PreventUserIdleSystemSleep=1 is open. In this particular case, it as coreaudiod.  I was thinking of something similar to the Windows powercfg -requestsoverride for specific processes/drivers.  <answer179666> You can use a third party tool like Power Manager to make your Mac sleep after a period of inactivity.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VruMv.png" alt="Power Manager - power off after inactivity"  Unlike OS X's Energy Saver, Power Manager can put your unused Mac to sleep even when an application or process has requested otherwise.   Disclaimer: I wrote Power Manager and can answer comments about how it works.  <comment213055> Do you need the process to keep running? <comment213056> Mainly, yes. In my example, if I leave the Mac in the room on some youtube playlist before falling asleep, I don't want to have to close the process manually. <comment213058> I can find a million ways to test if PreventUserIdleSystemSleep=1 is set but none whatsoever to override it - even https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/pmset.1.html didn't give me a clue, but it may to someone smarter than me ;) <comment213104> Awesome app - thanks for the disclaimer - this is exactly what I'll need to recommend for some clients. <comment213157> So, the only sure way is to schedule when to enter sleep. It isn't exactly what I am looking for, because I don't always know when I am supposed to fall asleep. <comment213158> I will consider the answer if nothing simpler is available. <comment213212> Power Manager can put your Mac to [sleep after periods of inactivity](http://www.dssw.co.uk/blog/2011-04-14-how-to-make-your-mac-sleep-after-inactivity/) – no need to set pre-determined times. <comment213343> I'll test it then when I have the time and get back to this.
