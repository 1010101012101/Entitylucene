How can I move through words when typing a command in iTerm2? <body> I'm in Lion  with iTerm2, Zsh and Oh-My-Zsh  but I cannot move through words when pressing: ALT+left arrow or CMD+left arrow or something  instead, when I press "ALT+right arrow" it prints [C and when I press "SHIFT+ALT+left arrow" it prints D0  how I can config iTerm2 to behave like any other program when moving through words?  <answer38983> The default is on Control-left Control-right. To customize, edit preferences/Keys and associate the escape code to some other hotkey of your choice  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1YtPc.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer123723> I finally found the solution to this problem here: https://coderwall.com/p/h6yfda. The necessary steps are shown below:  ol liGo to Preferences, Profile, Keys./li liSet your left ⌥ key to act as an escape character./li liLocate the current shortcut for ⌥ ← or create a new one, with the following settings: ul liKeyboard Shortcut: ⌥←/li liAction: Send Escape Sequence/li liEsc+: b/li /ul/li lirepeat for the ⌥→ keyboard shortcut with the following settings: ul liKeyboard Shortcut: ⌥→/li liAction: Send Escape Sequence/li liEsc+: f/li /ul/li /ol  <answer123964> To make option-left and option-right move through words in iTerm 2, add  precodebindkey -e bindkey '\e\e[C' forward-word bindkey '\e\e[D' backward-word /code/pre  to code~/.zshrc/code if you use zsh, or add  precode"\e\e[C": forward-word "\e\e[D": backward-word /code/pre  to code~/.inputrc/code if you use bash.  Control-left would be code\e[1;9D/code in iTerm 2 and code\e[1;5D/code in Terminal, and control-right would be code\e[1;9C/code in iTerm 2 and code\e[1;5C/code in Terminal.  To see the escape sequence for a key combination, run codecat -v/code and then press the key combination.  <answer258120> Open your profile and under emKeys/em tab, use emNatural Text Editing/em option.  <comment40790> solution a possible solution for this http://shadowfiend.posterous.com/backwards-word-forwards-word-and-kill-word-in <comment144492> fespinozacast: the link no longer works. Do you remember what was the solution for your question? <comment144502> While these links may answer the question, it is better to include the essential parts of the answer here and provide the links for reference. Link-only answers can become invalid if the linked pages change. <comment144539> I did include the essential parts of the solution in the answer I posted in SuperUser. I understand what you say, but I was wondering if it would still apply when you are linking to an answer in a StackExchange website.  Another reason I didn't include the solution steps here is because my two answers would have come out identical, even tough they are in different SE sites. What's the preferred way of doing things in a situation like this? <comment144540> Perhaps one of the questions is in the wrong site. Should I flag it, instead of providing the same answer for both? <comment144928> I provided the necessary steps for the solution, so the answers remains useful if the linked article ever goes down.
