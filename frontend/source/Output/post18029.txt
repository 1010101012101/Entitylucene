How can I rename desktops in Mission Control? <body> The default new desktop space is named 'Desktop 1'. If you create a new one, it is named 'Desktop 2'. Is there a way to change those default names to something more meaningful?  Additionally, it looks like you can't rearrange spaces either and the 'automatically rearrange spaces based on most recent use' checkbox seems to do nothing.  <answer18035> No, there is no way to do that in the current build. Well, sort of. An example is if you have iTunes open in fullscreen in a separate desktop, and go to mission control, the desktop will be called iTunes.  <comment19723> From the looks of what?  What it is the resource you are deriving that assumption from? <comment19736> Just the name of the desktops, and from the speculation of other people. Look at the names of the desktops: Desktop 1, Desktop 2, Desktop _n_. It just doesn't make sense to have them unrenameable. <comment19743> I wish I could assume that too, but the old Spaces when viewed under Spaces Preferences (e.g. when assigning applications) were also just Space 1, Space 2, Space N and Apple never changed that either despite the fact people clamored for it (myself included). <comment20024> Why does it show it like that here then? http://nerdvittles.com/?p=765 Or have I just completely jumped the gun...coz to be honest I haven't even read the link. <comment20025> Full-screen apps have own space. Those are full-screen apps on the picture. <comment35327> Somehow I changed the order of the desktops: Desktop 1, Desktop 4, Desktop 2, Desktop 3. So now the de defaults don't make any sense. I don't know how I did it, but if it is possible to reorder them, it definitely makes sense to be able to rename them. <comment35328> The desktops automatically rearrange themselves based on recent use. You can disable this in the Mission Control System Preference. <comment82331> Does anyone know of a third-party app that can do this? <comment111402> @Will Hyperspaces does it: http://hyperspacesapp.com/ Or did it, rather. Upgrading is not always smart. <comment111429> @isomorphismes, shame. Thanks anyways! <comment142123> this bug is just beyond my imagination... <comment184865> Really. Forcing them to be named 1,2,3,4... but then allowing them to sorted into different orders makes no sense. <comment270860> @Zombies plus using the word "Desktop" is completely backwards, because nothing about the desktop changes, except maybe the background. I would expect a different desktop to be, well, a completely different desktop. <comment369637> This is a terrible solution, but it "works" for me, more or less. I use a sticky note with a 124 point font that I hide under the dock on each desktop. It's legible in mission control's desktop thumbnails and usually (since it's under the dock), is not covered by another window. The dock is not shown in the thumbnails in mission control, so they are usually unobscured. The main problem is they all get sucked up into the first desktop when you restart (but I rarely restart, so it's tolerable for me).
