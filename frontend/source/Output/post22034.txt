Why can't I reply emails but send new one on my iPad 2? <body> I cannot reply to emails on my iPad 2, but if I compose a new one it will send it fine. This is a new problem as it was working fine before and there have been no changes.   I use a Telstra Micro SIM and an optus email address.  <answer22051> Usually deleting an app or an account and re-downloading it / reentering your account details—with a hard restart in between—will fix such errors.   <answer22200> I believe that what is happening is that you have multiple email accounts setup, and when you go to compose you are using the outgoing of account strongA/strong, and when you reply/forward you are attempting to use the outgoing of account strongB/strong.  So to fix, check your outgoing account settings for the account that you cannot reply emails for.  <answer199778> Thanks all. I have cured the problem by deleting a Yahoo account which shared the same e mail address as BT.  <comment24316> There have been changes, somehow, somewhere. What's happening is your incoming and outgoing settings don't match up somehow. Check your authentication settings as well. <comment24320> I have checked both of them over and over.I even took screen shots to ensure it was all the same. <comment24321> Have you deleted and recreated them? <comment24330> yeah I cleared out all fields restarted it and re endered them. <comment24373> Are you receiving an error messages when you try to send the reply? Does the problem occur on multiple email account or just this one? (try making a dummy gmail to test with...) <comment240610> This does not really answer the question.  Perhaps you can explain what you did more clearly and what "BT" means.
