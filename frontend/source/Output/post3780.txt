How can I change multiple line code indentation in Textmate? <body> When I use textmate, I select multiple lines and I press TAB, I would like to change the indentation of my code, rather than deleting it.  Is there a way to change this functionality?  <answer3781> Not sure about changing the tab but you can use  kbdCMD/kbd + }   to indent multiple lines of code at the same time.  kbdCMD/kbd + {  pushes it to the right.  <answer3783> Using kbdAlt/kbd + kbdTab/kbd also works.  <answer9270> I like to hold down kbdalt/kbd and then use the mouse to select a column of text. Then I hit tab to indent the lines.   <comment3571> Handy to know... <comment11244> doesnt work anymore in the most recent stable version...
