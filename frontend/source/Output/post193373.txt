Google account cannot activate mail <body> I am trying to set up a Google Apps account on Yosemite. I can log into the account, up until where I select which services to active. It will only activate Contacts and Messages. Mail, Calendar, and Notes will not activate with a very generic error message: codeAn unknown error occurred./code  As part of a migration, I first tried adding the account next to the 'old' account, which gave all kind of errors pertaining to Yosemite not liking it that I wanted two accounts for the same email address. Maybe there still are some remnants of that, that I should clean out, but I don't know how.  <comment230475> Which Google apps are we talking about, the paid business version or the free version. Legacy free edition of Google Apps (no longer available to new customers) !! <comment230482> Erasing every instance of the account, restarting and adding again has worked for me in the past. <comment230513> @Buscarì›ƒSD The paid business version. Jaime, I tried removing it from the Internet accounts prefpane, but that doesn't work.
