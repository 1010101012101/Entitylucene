launchctl doesn't start cntlm daemon <body> I've installed cntlm on osx using the homebrew formula.  Then I've copied the .plist file and started the daemon:  precodesudo cp -fv /usr/local/opt/cntlm/*.plist /Library/LaunchDaemons sudo chown root /Library/LaunchDaemons/homebrew.mxcl.cntlm.plist /code/pre  But after the reboot the daemon isn't running. I've tried to run it manually with  precodesudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/homebrew.mxcl.cntlm.plist /code/pre  but its output is  precode/Library/LaunchDaemons/homebrew.mxcl.cntlm.plist: Operation already in progress /code/pre  I've also checked the plist file with codeplutil -lint/code and it is ok.  This is the source of code/Library/LaunchDaemons/homebrew.mxcl.cntlm.plist/code:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt;   &lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;homebrew.mxcl.cntlm&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;array&gt;         &lt;string&gt;/usr/local/opt/cntlm/bin/cntlm&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;/array&gt;     &lt;key&gt;KeepAlive&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;false/&gt;     &lt;key&gt;RunAtLoad&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;true/&gt;     &lt;key&gt;StandardOutPath&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;/var/null&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;key&gt;StandardErrorPath&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;/var/null&lt;/string&gt;   &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  Do you know why this happen and how to run it correctly as a daemon?  <answer214333> I hit this problem just now. The following got codecntlm/code going for me.  precodesudo launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/homebrew.mxcl.cntlm.plist sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/homebrew.mxcl.cntlm.plist /code/pre  This is only a workaround, I'm afraid (at least for me). The problem recurs on every reboot.  <comment253508> Please can you check `system.log` using Console.app for messages. `launchd` is typically good at logging useful errors and warnings about why a job is not running. Do you see the job being logged as started? <comment253513> No, there isn't any start log. But if I try to start it manually it says: "Operation already in progress". I've also checked with `ps aux` if cntlm is running, but no process exists.
