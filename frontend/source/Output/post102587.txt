How to get Mail.app to show email addresses? <body> In 10.7's Mail.app, it shows all recipients as a blue bubble with a name in it.  In order to see the email address, I have to click on the right side of the bubble, to get a pop-up menu.  This is a big pain, especially when I have more than one recipient.  I can only see one address at a time.  Is there a way to get Mail.app to show me actual email addresses, either in addition to or instead of the "name" it's using?  <answer102590> Open Mail.app, then go to emMail/em in the top menu  emPreferences/em  emViewing/em  Uncheck em"Use Smart Addresses"/em.  This should display the full name of the contact plus the email address.
