How can I stop my iPad from asking me about logging in to iCloud? <body> I do not want to use the iCloud in any way. I do not want it running at all. I want it gone. How do I stop it from asking to log in? It is asking every 10 seconds. It has made my iPad unusable. How do I get rid of it so I can use my iPad?  <answer129241> Have you turned off all iCloud features?  To do that on your iOS deviceâ€™s Home screen, go to Settings  iCloud, then tap to turn on or off iCloud features.
