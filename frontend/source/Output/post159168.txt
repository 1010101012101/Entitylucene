Is there any way to get a path to a file in the GUI in Yosemite? <body> In Mavericks it was simple: click "Get Info" on any file and you could copy/paste the file path. This is no longer included in Yosemite.  I need to need to copy/paste paths frequently, like "/Users/Whoever/MyPath/File.app".  Is there any way to do this in Yosemite without resorting to the terminal?  <answer159169> You could drag the file into a Safari window and copy the path from the URL bar. Or drag the file into a Plain Text file in Text Edit. (As you can also do with Terminal.) EDIT: Safari will only accept certain types. Use a Text Edit file instead.  <comment187088> Take a look here: http://superuser.com/questions/829295/how-to-copy-unix-file-path-in-os-x-yosemite
