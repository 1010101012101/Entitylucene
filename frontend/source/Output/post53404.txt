How to disable startup connection to a 'dead' server? <body> My mac (OsX 10.7) try to connect to a disabled server at startup. How to remove /delete this auto connection (that fail each time) ? Thanks  <answer53408> My guess would be that there is a login item for the dead server. To Remove it access Systems preferences via:  codeï£¿/code - codeSystem Preferences/code - codeUsers &amp; Groups/code - codeChoose your user/code - codeLogin items/code -   Select the Dead Server and press "-" to remove it.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VG9ta.png" alt="Login Items"  <answer121814> On newer Mac hardware,  you may also get this from the Remote Disk settings. You can fix this by unchecking the Remote Disk box in the Finder Favorites under devices.  <answer176918> I solved this by going to Finder - Go - Connect to Server (command-K).  In there was a "Favorite Server" that was the culprit.  Removed it and the problem went away.  <comment61090> You might want to provide some more background on what your computer is trying to do. Connecting to a disabled server doesn't explain what kind of connection, how do you know this is happening, etc. <comment139165> This worked for me.  A slightly different variant I had was, I had a folder on a remote server (that was no longer connected) in my Favorites column on Finder, so instead of FS showing up in the example above, I had a folder called "My_Photos" that I needed to remove.
