How do I get the original finder view back? <body> For some strange reason, Finder has changed to a different layout and I can't figure out how to revert it to the standard one.  This is what it looks like now:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UtQNv.png" alt="New strange Finder layout"  How do I revert it to the original, default layout, that has folders, drives and devices in the left-most column and all the other files and folders in the middle panes?   I see the original layout when I go to upload a file here, so you can see the screenshot here:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bIKNh.png" alt="Original Layout"  How do I get back that original layout and prevent it from changing again? This is the second or third time it has changed.  <answer164981> ul liShow the Toolbar with ⌥⌘T or View → Show Toolbar/li liShow the Sidebar with ⌥⌘S or View → Show Sidebar/li /ul  <comment193649> Perfect....Thanks!
