How to bind specific window to a hotkey? <body> On Windows I use a simple Autohotkey script that allows me to easily bind to and switch beetween opened windows.  For example, I'm about to be using a browser, two consoles and a text editor in the next hour. So I open the browser and press codeCtrl+Win+1/code to bind it to the code1/code key. Similarly, I map consoles to code2/code and code3/code keys, and the editor to code4/code key.  And now I can switch to the specific app just by pressing codeAlt+&lt;number&gt;/code. It allows me to work literally not touching a mouse for hours. I can't imagine my life without it.  strongThe question is/strong: How do I achieve this on El Capitan? I've tried the Automator and Karabiner apps, but did not succeed.  <answer216088> Try out Witch - among many other features:  precodeChoose any of the first ten windows with a single keypress. /code/pre  <comment261098> Does "first" mean "recently switched to"? If it does, then it wouldn't be of much help: the key-window associations will change as we cycle through the windows.
