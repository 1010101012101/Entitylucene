Messages not working on iPhone 5 <body> I am using an iPhone 5, version 9.3.2, 32 GB of memory, 27.1 of capacity.  Suddenly I cannot use my Messages.  Other option is working well but when click Messages it's just hanging.   I even cannot delete/read/send any messages.   I already powered off my phone but still same thing.  What can I do now?  <answer242424> ol liPress the Home button twice. This will bring up recently used apps. Find the Message app and swipe up. This will force close the app./li liHold down the Power button until the power-slider appears, but don't turn the device off. Instead, while that power-slider is showing, hold down the Home button until your home screen re-appears./li liHold down the Home and Power buttons until the Apple Logo shows, and then release. /li liIf one of your recent messages had a photo or video, try deleting it from the Messages. This may keep it from crashing again if you're able to open the app at all./li /ol  → Try this multiple times.  If these steps still don't fix the problem, try backing up your iPhone to iTunes. Then restore from the backup. This step is tedious, I understand. But it may solve the problem when everything else has failed.  strongEDIT:/strong  (additional suggestions)  Going beyond what usually fixes this problem...  You're options, shy of going to an Apple Store for an actual diagnostic, would be limited at this point. I see two options.  • Restore as a new iPhone.  • Try downloading PhoneClean on your computer. I have only used this briefly and am not entirely proficient in this app, but it has helped me in the past. It's available for Mac and PC.  <comment297060> Have you tried the troubleshooting tips in this article? https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204065 <comment297982> applying this troubleshooting but still same. now what i do ? @TMHahn <comment297996> Hold the Home button and Power button down until you see the Apple logo, then release.
