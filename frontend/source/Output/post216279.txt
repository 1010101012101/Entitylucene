How do I remove my photos from iCloud? <body> I've disabled iCloud photo storage and am trying to get my 296 photos onto my PC before they're deleted after 30 days. Do I have to install iCloud and set it up on my PC to get my photos or is there a way I can do it without having to do that?  <answer216335> If you don't want to install the iCloud utility, you can go to iCloud Web Page, choose Photos and select all the pics you want to download. But you have to click on every photo to download the entire collection, I did't find any "Select All" option (even CMD + A does't work). But anyway, you're lucky, we're talking about 'just' 296 photos ;)  <comment261302> Open a browser and log into iCloud.com using your appleId
