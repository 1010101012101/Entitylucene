Archive Utility will not automatically quit. Stays in Dock <body> I recently deleted my ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dock.plist in order to fix something on macOS Sierra. After I killed the Dock and rebooted, I now notice every time I unzip a file, Archive Utility from CoreServices stays in the Dock after it is finished. It successfully unzips files and does not seem to be unresponsive.  I have read from a few other people online when this happened to them in previous OS X versions, they repaired permissions and that fixed the issue. Since that is not possible on macOS Sierra, does anyone know what I might do to fix this?  Thanks  <comment363127> Is there any chance it's actually just docked? <comment363203> thanks, not docked though.
