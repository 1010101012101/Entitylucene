How to see progress of download started in the terminal <body> When downloading software via the terminal is there a way to see the download progress?  I kicked off a download via the terminal and I can't tell if it's progressing or stuck.  <answer238526> Open Terminal on your Mac and enter the following command:  precodecurl -O &lt;URL  for download&gt; /code/pre  That is a capital "O" not a zero.   Here a nice site with some terminal commands you might like to use.   <answer238531> Another option is to install codewget/code (e.g. with Homebrew), which has more user-friendly defaults than curl, including displaying an ASCII-art progress bar.  For example:  precode&gt; brew install wget &gt; wget google.com Saving to: 'index.html' ... index.html                      [ &lt;=&gt;              ]  10.32K  --.-KB/s in 0.001s  2016-05-17 12:55:06 (8.08 MB/s) - 'index.html' saved [10563] /code/pre  <comment292563> Which command did you run? Different commands have different ways of seeing their progress.
