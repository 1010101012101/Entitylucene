How to type a capital letter from the extended Latin alphabet in OS X <body> I'm aware that if you want to type a character from extended Latin alphabet in OS X (like in the word codeüber/code), you just press the basic symbol key for a while and then a popup occurs with the list of extended symbols.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bmFZH.png" width="198" /  But, I would like to type this letter in uppercase. I press the symbol key (for Example kbdU/kbd + kbdShift/kbd), then see the character popup. Then I press the number of the required symbol, although I am given an code@/code sign instead of the uppercase codeÜ/code.  How can I type capital letters with accents? I don't want to copy and paste symbols that I require every time from the web or developer console.  <answer212938> I've been looking for a while for the answer but didn't get lucky. It turned out that you have to press the basic symbol key for a while to request the system popup.  When holding kbdShift/kbd and basic letter key, press left/right arrows to choose necessary symbol. Then when you choose, press kbdEnter/kbd key.  So for Æ sign you have to press kbdShift/kbd + kbdA/kbd + kbdright/left arrow/kbd.  That's it. Now you can type codeÜBÊR/code and so on.  <answer212951> Hold the kbdshift/kbd key then the number corresponding.  It works just fine.  I think you are forgetting to let go of the kbdshift/kbd before hitting the number.  Hence the unexpected output.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PfQgv.png" alt="Type diacritics"  Hold kbdshift/kbd+kbdU/kbd then, after popup emlet go of the shift key/em and hit the corresponding number.br Ü ← result  <comment257132> Or, if you have a numeric keypad, press the number there, even if you are still holding the shift. <comment257134> @GEdgar good one.  For example, the Apple wired keyboard.
