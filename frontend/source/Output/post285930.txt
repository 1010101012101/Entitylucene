Using iPhone 5 and can't delete photos synced from my computer <body> I already saw a reply saying,  "In iTunes select the device icon in the Devices List on the left. Click the Photos tab in the resulting window. Choose Sync photos from, being iPhoto or Aperture on a Mac and Photoshop Album or Photoshop Elements on a Windows PC. Choose Select Albums and deselect the albums or collections you want to delete. Click Apply." This did not work when I hit apply the iTunes app said it made the changes but I still have the photos on my iPhone. I need to update the photos weekly, and used to be able to do this prior to the last update. I use a photo for my work schedule. However, now I cannot update the photos, or delete the old photos. Any advice to help with my issue would be greatly appreciated.
