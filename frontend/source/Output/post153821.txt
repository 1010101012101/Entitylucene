how to connect 4 laptops to one monitor <body> I am trying to connect video from 4 laptops to a big screen monitor and be able switch from one to another easily without having to connect and disconnect cables.  Thanks  <answer153824> Unless your monitor supports 4 inputs, which most don't, you'll likely need a switch.  Presuming your laptops all have Mini Displayport or Thunderbolt out, this will work.  <comment181051> How about an [HDMI switcher](http://www.amazon.com/Etekcity%C2%AE-Switcher-Supports-Wireless-Performance/dp/B00B2CGUPY/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&qid=1414677353&sr=8-7&keywords=hdmi+switcher), it's far cheaper? <comment181712> Oops, apparently I missed the word "video" in OP's question.  Thanks dude.
