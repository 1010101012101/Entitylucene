Applescript to automate drop-down selection in Mozilla Firefox <body> I'm trying to automate the selection of a value from a drop-down box in Mozilla using an applescript. What I want it to do is to codetab/code to the drop-down box and enter codedown/code twice to select the third item in the drop-down.  Here is what I have so far:     tell application "Firefox"br       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tell application "System Events" to keystroke tabbr       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tell application "System Events" to keystroke downbr       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tell application "System Events" to keystroke downbr   end tell   But, as far as I can tell, when I run the script nothing happens.  What do I need to do to make this script work?  EDIT: I have also tried entering the key code code125/code for codedown/code in case the keystroke command was wrong.   <answer80521> Try this   precodetell application "Firefox"     activate     tell application "System Events"         keystroke tab         keystroke (key code 125)         keystroke (key code 125)         keystroke (key code 125)             end tell end tell /code/pre  You might not need to activate Firefox if it's the current active app. Them you just need :   precodetell application "System Events"     keystroke tab     keystroke (key code 125)     keystroke (key code 125)     keystroke (key code 125)         end tell /code/pre  <comment92925> I think you might have misunderstood. I _want_ to navigate within the page. There are a number of drop-down menus _on_ the page. I want to set up something that will let me tab to one of these menus and select the third value on the list. I will then repeat the script for the number of drop-down menus. The issue is a large number of drop-down menus that I need to select the third value from each of. I don't want to get to the address bar. <comment92927> I modified your suggestion, though, and found something that works. I just replaced the keystroke "l" line with my original tab line. <comment92947> ok I edited my answer to match what you were looking for.
