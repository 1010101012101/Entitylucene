How can I execute key shortcuts that use characters requiring Shift, like #? <body> I have a 2011 13" MacBook Pro and I'm using Snow Leopard.  When I program, I use Eclipse. Recently, I installed a plugin and I wanted to use a key shortcut rather than navigating 3 menus every time to do the action. The default shortcut for that action is Command + #. I have tried changing it, and that does not work. So I am wondering, how can I execute a key shortcut that uses a key like #? I tried Command + Shift + 3(#), but that did not work.
