Single-purpose app to prevent .DS_Store creation under Mavericks <body> Asepsis is currently not working under Mavericks. It's, in my knowledge, the only single-purpose app existing for this job. Therefore, what is the less intrusive solution to prevent .DS_Store creation after the update to Mavericks?  <answer108064> The free app TinkerTool 5.0, which has many functions, can be used on Mavericks to disable creating .DS_Store files on network volumes, but I do not believe this has any effect on .DS_Store files on your local Mac.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WmO5m.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer108132> BlueHarvest does not prevent the creation of .DS_Store files, but it can delete them automatically.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LJWTB.png" alt=""  You can also delete .DS_Store files by using find:  precodefind / -name .DS_Store -delete /code/pre  <answer108614> Asepsis updates have been officially released for Mavericks compatibility - http://asepsis.binaryage.com/  I've personally tested it, working like a charm!  <comment126770> The setting can also be enabled with `defaults write com.apple.desktopservices DSDontWriteNetworkStores -bool true`, but it only disables creating .DS_Store files on network volumes. <comment126867> Actually what TinkerTool does is to provide a GUI that generates many different defaults write files. It also keeps track of the ones that it creates, and it can de-install all of them using the Reset button, which puts all customizations back to their pre-TinkerTool state. This is very useful because otherwise if you create a lot of your own defaults write files, you may not remember what they all are and how to reset things back the way they were. <comment127297> This is actually the closest solution to what I'm looking for. However, there is a quiet important delay between the creation of a given .DS_Store file and it detection by BlueHarvest for removal. In the situation, for example, where you're a creating an archive for a windows user, this can be annoying...
