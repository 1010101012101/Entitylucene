How can I prohibit network users from accessing other user's home folders using Server permissions? <body> I have a 10.8 server, network users on a shared drive 'User Data' - used as a AFP for home folders, OD is on. All users are part of a group 'students 2013/14'.  My network user can login via OD over a network, however the permissions are not set correctly, since network user accounts can access all other users folder read/write on the sharepoint.  Question: How can I set the permissions in Server.app correctly so that network users can login, use their server based home folder w/r but not access other network user home folders using the student 2013/14 group?  <answer105827> ol liLaunch Server.app/li liClick "File Sharing."/li liClick "Users."/li liUse Minus Sign to Remove Certain Users from Certain Folders./li /ol  <comment124448> This is a poor answer, my question is how I can set the group to have access to the shared users folder, its own users folder with read/write but not other users folders. As in; read and write to the root but not use inheritance for the other sub folders. <comment124763> It may help to provide a screenshot of what your User Data share permissions look like.
