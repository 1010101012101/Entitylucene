Iphone 5s battery broken? <body> My Iphone 5s works great, but when i use it the battery jumps around. Is there and easy fix for that or is it broken?  Greetings from the Swiss  <comment313971> What do you mean battery jumps around? <comment313972> It means that when it's 100% charged when i use it for 10 minutes the battery goes down to 50% but when i charge it it says that's 90% charged <comment313974> Possibly an issue with either the fuel gauge, or your Lion cell. Take it to Apple. if its a fuel gauge issue, then you will most likely get the main board replaced by apple, or you can try your luck at a third party. But if its an issue with the battery, they will just replace it.
