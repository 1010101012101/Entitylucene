Is it possible to display images sent from an iOS phone in the Yosemite Messages app? <body> My wife and I occasionally swap silly pictures via iMessage on our iPhones.  I also sometimes forget my cell phone at home.  I have signed in to Messages on my work desktop, so I can get the text messages from her;  but the images are never displayed properly.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Gfzps.png" alt="enter image description here"  I can right-click on these images to bring up a contextual menu;  "Quick Look" does nothing, "Save to Downloads" does nothing, and "Open" brings up a dialog box saying that emThe application “Messages.app” does not have permission to open “IMG_3944.JPG”./em  I have used Disk Utility to "Repair Disk Permissions", to no avail.  Is there a way to get around this and see the images that I've been sent?  <comment352757> "silly pictures"....sure ;-)
