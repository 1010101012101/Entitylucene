Where are password hashes stored for managed/mobile accounts in OSX Mavericks? <body> I have a Mac from my school with many restrictions placed on it because of an incident last year. I was able to bypass the firmware password and format the hard drive and install ArchLinux. I tried doing that again, but I was unable to bypass the firmware. I've resorted to pulling a password hash for the admin account.  I tried using   precodedefaults read /var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/users/USER.plist ShadowHashData /code/pre  but that gave me  precodeThe domain/default pair of (/var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/users/USER.plist, ShadowHashData) does not exist /code/pre  Apparently the password hash for a managed/mobile account is stored in a different location, and I can't find where it is. I know this account has been used to log into this computer before, so the hash has to be somewhere.   If someone could help me out here, I'd greatly appreciate it.
