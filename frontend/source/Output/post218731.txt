Why bash history on my mac won't save? <body> I have always used bash for work, and never had problems with it. Now, it does not save any command in history again.  If I open a window terminal, try some commands, it acts like everything has worked fine and show me history using the arrow keys. But If I close the window (and that it is the time that it supposed to be save on the .bash_history file) and open another one, there are no signs of the last commands.  How can I find out what is going wrong? Or re-set everything from blank.   <answer219825> Starting in strongOS X 10.11 El Capitan/strong, the system-installed script code/etc/bashrc_Apple_Terminal/code coordinates with Terminal in order to save/restore separate command histories for each terminal restored for strongResume/strong.  Read the comments in code/etc/bashrc_Apple_Terminal/code for an explanation of how it manages per-terminal command histories and how to customize it.  If you customize codePROMPT_COMMAND/code be sure to concatenate to the previous value so you don't wipe out the system-supplied command:  precodePROMPT_COMMAND="${PROMPT_COMMAND:+$PROMPT_COMMAND; }your_code_here" /code/pre  If you install an codeEXIT/code signal handler with codetrap/code be sure to do something similar (or call shell_session_update from your handler if you can't figure out how to concatenate to the previous valueâ€”it's a little involved).  When you exit the shell, this code will save new commands to the terminal's history in code~/.bash_sessions/code. To see if it encounters any problems, instead of closing the terminal exit the shell manually with codeexit/code (or Control-D). It logs progress messages. Note if it doesn't complete or if any sort of warning or error messages are displayed.  In general, codebashrc_Apple_Terminal/code attempts to detect and disable per-session history if it looks like the user has performed any customizations that aren't compatible with it. It sounds like you may have found one it doesn't handle.

(It saved the commands after I closed the terminal)  P.S. I also use the codeHISTFILESIZE/code and codeHISTSIZE/code variables  <answer271190> Just in case there are others out there that have RVM (Ruby Version Manager) installed: Check to see if you have the following line in your code~/.profile/code, code~/.bashrc/code or code~/.bash_profile/code files.  code[[ -s "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" ]] &amp;&amp; source "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm"/code     It's probably RVM preventing the exit "hook" for bash_sessions to run.   That was the problem for me. Try commenting it out.  Source: Reddit  <comment264462> Could be your profile or rc file. What's in them? <comment264463> What are the permissions and owner on your .bash_history? Mine are 600 and owned by me. Also, what's in $HIST_FILE? <comment264554> @blm Permissions are right; printing the $HIST_FILE I found out about [.bash_sessions](https://www.reddit.com/r/osx/comments/397uep/changes_to_bash_sessions_and_terminal_in_el/) . Apparently there are problems when, at the end of a session, the OS save those file to the history file. I don't want to investigate anymore so I have simply put this in my home `.bash_sessions_disable` and know it return to the default behavior <comment265871> Please consider filing a bug report with Apple: https://developer.apple.com/bug-reporting/ <comment319743> Adding that one line works fine for me on El Capitan, thanks. <comment367928> Thanks! I would love to know why this works, too, if someone happens to know.  (History=0 would imply to my ignorant mind that all history will be lost, yet it seems to have the opposite effect.)
