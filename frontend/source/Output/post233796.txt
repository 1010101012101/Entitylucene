Airmon-ng on Mac <body> so I know that Airmon-ng isn't made for Mac, but every time I try to run it all it says is that the wireless tools are missing. And I've heard people say to just download the wireless tools but where exactly can i get those from?  Also, is there a similar command? I figured tcpdump might be the thing that comes closest, but is there a flag that is equivalent to Airmen's "check" flag that lists all programs that could interfere with the wireless card? I tried looking for a similar tcpdump flag, but I'm not sure if maybe I missed it.  Thank you for your thoughts!  <comment285707> That would be great to have on OS X.
