How can I disable Mac OS Lion asking if I really want to open a downloaded file? <body> I already tried this:  precodecd ~/Downloads find . -print0 | xargs -0 xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /code/pre  But it doesn't seem to work under Mac OS X 10.7 (aka. Lion) anymore:  precodexattr: ./cabin/Cabin-Bold.otf: No such xattr: com.apple.quarantine /code/pre  <answer19142> I haven't tested this under Lion but   precodedefaults write com.apple.LaunchServices LSQuarantine -bool NO /code/pre  strongand then restarting/strong should totally disable this functionality.  <comment20952> I think this is more for SuperUser... <comment20953> display all extended attributes via xattr and see whether some new attribute is set on the file <comment20954> Unix type commands to configure one's Operating System... not really a programming question. <comment105554> question : where should i put this setting?
