My iPad is connected to my Mac's Wi-Fi, but can't connect to the Internet <body> I have a Mac which is connected to the Internet via Ethernet. I've used the "create network" facility on it to create a Wi-Fi network.  I opened up my iPad's settings and connected to that Wi-Fi network.  But when I try to connect to browse using Safari on the iPad I get, "Cannot open page -- Safari cannot open the page because it is not connected to the Internet".  Any way I can get on the Web with this iPad?  <answer51467> I was able to get it to work by restarting everything -- computer, iPad, router, and cable modem.  <comment58787> Is Internet connection sharing enabled on the Mac? <comment58790> Is there any easy way to see what IP address the iPad is getting? If it's self-assigned (usually starting with 69.*) then you are not truly connected to that wifi network.  One way to confirm is to see if you can access the broadcasting Mac's shared files. <comment58791> Thanks for the comments. @Randolph West Yes, Internet connection sharing is enabled. Anthony -- thanks, I'll look into that. <comment167692> You went nuclear.
