How can I search for photos taken at a specific time? <body> All my photos are in iPhoto and I want to be able to search for photos taken at a specific time. Happy to use an app or command to search at file system level from Terminal if I need to.  ol liSmart Albums will let me do date, but not time./li liSpotlight will let me search meta data, but I cannot figure out how I can do a fuzzy search on the codekMDItemContentCreationDate/code field./li /ol  Any ideas?  <answer65448> OK, so it turns out Aperture can do it with a Smart Album.  codeDate/code lets you specify codeCapture Hour of Day/code  codeEXIF/code lets you specify codeCapture Hour of Day/code, codeCapture Minute of Hour/code and even codeCapture Second of Minute/code  Interestingly, iPhoto honours and displays this Smart Album but will not let you edit it.  Hope that's of help.  <comment77343> You can also search based on that EXIF data with the Finder. <comment77453> @MacLemon care to tell us how? I mentioned it in point 2 in the OP, but could not figure out how to only search the EXIF for time but not date <comment165479> So you have to buy Aperture? <comment165493> You should be able to find the old Aperture trial version.
