Mouse Pointer Locator <body> Due to a stroke, I have had some vision impairment in that I sometimes have a hard time locating my mouse pointer on the screen.  I have tried making the mouse pointer larger which helps but is still not the solution.  I am new to the Mac world and would appreciate your help.  In Windows, there is an option where pressing the CTRL key will help to identify the mouse pointer using a temporary display of several radiating concentric circles around the mouse pointer.  Is there something like this on OS X?  <answer189008> h3Pointer Finder/h3  This app will put a circle around your cursor when you press a key.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/s3jAX.jpg" alt=""  <answer189009> h3Mouseposé/h3  Mouseposè will highlight the cursor using a customisable dimming of the rest of the screen, and can zoom to the cursor's location.     Of course, there are other uses as well. If you have a large screen, it helps you quickly locate the mouse pointer when you return to your work after an interruption.

Take look at it in your syst preferences. <comment223890> @Buscar, looked in Accessibility first, not much there for somebody in my situation.  However, thanks fo the suggestion. <comment223896> OP already mentioned *"I have tried making the mouse pointer larger which that helps but is still not the solution."* <comment223898> is there a reason making bunch of individual answers when those could have been combined in one ? Is there a benefit to your approach? <comment223903> @Buscar Discussed on Meta: [When and how should I write two answers?](http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2063/when-and-how-should-i-write-two-answers) You didn't need to comment the same thing on every one of my answers individually. <comment224065> Other answers will get blocked. You have to scroll all the way down to see other answers. For this question a simple link in bullets would have done. <comment225543> Should geolocation be in the tags for this question? <comment225640> Hmmm....I do not recall that this tag was I originally added, however, in any event it is removed.  THX <comment226549> One can only assume "El Capitan" means Yosemite here. <comment226729> @Ender no, it's a new feature of the next os x release ("El Capitan") demoed in WWDC 2 days ago. <comment226843> Thanks @egwenesedai, looks like I'm behind on the alpha releases! <comment228532> There was no preference mentioned for an Apple solution. He did however say that he has tried your solution and said it wasn't the solution for him. <comment253410> Does anyone know how to turn this feature off? My mouse keeps getting really big when I move it and it's annoying. <comment255987> System Preference: Accessibility  Zoom, Check "Use scroll gesture with modified keys to zoom" <comment259352> @Nathan Go to Accessibility  Uncheck "Shake mouse pointer to locate" in System Preferences. <comment275280> Although Mouse Locator still works on El Capitan, it has to be manually reactivated on every login / restart, which is quite a nuisance. <comment342499> I like that the different options are in different answers so that I can be clear about what I am upvoting. For this reason, I actually kind of regret how much I put into my most popular answer. http://stackoverflow.com/a/14203146/117471 But it does get me about 50 reputation points a day, so... <comment342500> I find the Sierra (currently 10.12.3) is a bit spotty with this when using 2 external monitors on my MBP. Some days when I try to zoom on any of the external displays, one quarter of the zoom box shows up in a corner of my MPB display and the other three quarters are missing. It's a very annoying bug. I miss being able to zoom. I sometimes unplug my monitors if there is something I really need to check for pixel perfect accuracy. <comment342501> **WARNING:** clicking the link above downloaded a snowflakesMovie.mov file to my computer without my permission. That's pretty crappy. <comment342510> @BrunoBronosky Agreed - I now use a browser that asks you Vivaldi (and this gives me another reason to use it)vi - and I don't think it did that when I put up the link
