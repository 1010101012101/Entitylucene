A large number of files, some unknown, moved to trash, automatically! <body> This is like the weirdest problem I have ever faced with my MacBook Pro (OS X El Capitan).  Everything was fine, till yesterday, but suddenly today, I find that my trash contains a lot of my files and folders that I never put there, including folders which I do not even recognise. I'll put a screenshot below.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gsKHB.png" alt="screenshot of my trash file containing the folders"  The reason I know that I have not put them there myself is because most of them are the files I work on, regularly. I do have backups of all those files and folders, but I really want to know what made them go there in the first place. Nobody other than me uses my machine, nobody has access to my machine. I do not even recognise some of the folders in my trash, especially those that has a date in their folder names.  Most weird, the folder codeHDD.bak/code that sits in my trash now, was strongnot even on my machine/strong. It was in my codeWD My Cloud/code NAS. And only this folder has the codeput back/code option, the others do not even have that option, meaning that I cannot even restore them from my trash other than copy pasting. The folders are missing from their original directories, and has ended up here somehow. What should be the next thing I do? just restore them from codeTime Machine/code and forget about it?  strongUPDATE/strong  By the time I have posted this question, the number of deleted folders in my trash has almost doubled! Folders are just getting added randomly! strongWhat the hell is going on!/strong  <comment317044> Which applications were running on your Mac at the time of this event? <comment317046> @danielAzuelos I bought a new external HDD (WD My Passport) yesterday, and was just copying some files into the HDD from my mac. No other application was running. <comment317048> When did you check your MacBook Pro file system (`Disk Utility`)? <comment317050> @danielAzuelos, I did not get you. Check the file system, meaning? <comment317105> Is Google Drive, Dropbox running by chance? <comment317176> @JaimeSantaCruz, no but I do have a WD MyCloud sync running all the time to sync a few particular folders to my MyCloud NAS.
