How can I use RSVG with ImageMagick? <body> I'd like to use the RSVG for SVG processing in ImageMagick (the included library is fairly incomplete). RSVG is a supported delegate but needs to be installed separately.  I've installed librsvg and its dependencies using Homebrew (no custom settings or anything like that). Running codersvg-convert/code manually works fine.  Installing ImageMagick with Homebrew doesn't auto-detect and use the RSVG library and running IM's configure script with code--with-rsvg/code doesn't detect the library either.  Clearly something isn't talking to something else, but I can't make sense of the log messages well enough to sort it out. Any advice would be appreciated.  Here's the relevant portion of config.log:  precodeconfigure:31587: checking for RSVG configure:31594: $PKG_CONFIG --exists --print-errors "librsvg-2.0 &gt;= 2.9.0" Package xcb-shm was not found in the pkg-config search path. Perhaps you should add the directory containing `xcb-shm.pc' to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable Package 'xcb-shm', required by 'cairo', not found configure:31597: $? = 1 configure:31610: $PKG_CONFIG --exists --print-errors "librsvg-2.0 &gt;= 2.9.0" Package xcb-shm was not found in the pkg-config search path. Perhaps you should add the directory containing `xcb-shm.pc' to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable Package 'xcb-shm', required by 'cairo', not found configure:31613: $? = 1  configure:31640: result: no configure:31652: result:  /code/pre  <answer97654> This message indicates that codecairo/code, a prerequisite for codelibrsvg/code, cannot find the configuration options for package codexcb-shm/code. They should be stored in code/opt/X11/lib/pkgconfig/xcb-shm.pc/code. All you have to do is add this path to the environment variable code$PKG_CONFIG_PATH/code:  precodeexport PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:/opt/X11/lib/pkgconfig /code/pre  codeconfigure/code should now be able to find what it is looking for.
