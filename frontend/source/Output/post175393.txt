SSH rejecting key file with extended attributes <body> In my .ssh/ directory, when running  precode$ ssh-add dev  Permissions 0755 for 'dev' are too open. /code/pre  But looking at the dev file  precode$ ls -lF dev -rw-------@ 1 me  staff  1675 Feb  3 09:37 dev /code/pre  The @ at the end means that there are extended attributes. So I then run  precode$ xattr dev com.apple.metadata:kMDItemWhereFroms com.apple.quarantine /code/pre  These have no meaning to me.  It looks to me that the permissions are what they should be (600)  where is the discrepancy coming from, and how do I fix it?  <answer175432> I assume your working directory is code~/.ssh//code when you run codessh-add/code, codels/code and codexattr/code.  I suspect there is a subdirectory named codedev/code (i.e., code~/.ssh/dev//code). Check for it with codels -lFd dev/code.  codels/code normally lists the contents of a directory. Adding the code-d/code option lists a directory emas a directory itself/em.  Further, I suspect that there is a file, code~/.ssh/dev/dev/code which is what codels -lF/code is displaying the information about.  If my suspicion is correct, codexattr dev/code displays the extended attributes of the subdirectory named codedev/code (not the file codedev/dev/code). The directory attributes probably are not the cause of this problem.  If this is confusing, codels -lFR/code might help you see what's happening (the code-R/code option recursively lists subdirectories).  Finally, if my suspicion is correct and you're really trying to add a private key identity file named code~/.ssh/dev/dev/code to the ssh authentication agent, try codessh-add dev/dev/code (or perhaps better, codessh-add ~/.ssh/dev/dev/code, which should work no matter the permissions of the enclosing directory.  <comment206814> These extended attributes are usually attached when you download the file from the Internet with Safari, Chrome or some download manager. I find it curious why you download a private key from the Internet, if that is indeed the case. <comment206858> The key came through Skype from another user. <comment213480> This was not a sub-directory of ~/.ssh, it was a sub-directory of ~ that had the xattr set and causing the confusion.  That fixed it.  Thanks!
