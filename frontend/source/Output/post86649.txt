Is it possible to transfer data from one iphone to another via SMS or emai? <body> let's say that i have an iOS application that stores some personal data, say a drawing that i just created. Another person has the same application as me. Is it possible for me to send my drawing to another device ?  The devices are not on the same network, let's say there's a distance of 100km between them. Is it possible to transfer such data in a way that will be recognized by the application ? If so, can it be done via SMS or email is better ? What is the best way ?  <comment100146> That is unanswerable in general because it depends on the application in question. Can you please add the specific application you are looking for here? <comment100288> I don't have a specific application in mind. I just want to ask if that is possible to happen in an application and what are the transport means to do such application domain transfers.
