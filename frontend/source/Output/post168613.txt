I want to allow a specific port but still keep my firewall active. OS X 10.8 <body> I have tried this from a previous post:   The builtin firewall used by OS X is ipfw. To learn more about it from the Terminal you can enter codeman ipfw/code.  To create a new firewall rule to allow incoming traffic on to a particular port you can enter the rule from the Terminal as follows.  precodesudo ipfw add 40000 allow tcp from any to any dst-port portnum /code/pre  where codeportnum/code is the number of the port you wish opened. In this case I've added a rulenum of 40000 to the rule so that if you ever wanted to remove it the following command will suffice.  precodesudo ipfw delete 40000 /code/pre  If you enter the command codesudo ipfw list/code you will see the active commands. To reload the firewall issue the command codesudo ipfw flush/code  If you want to log the hits the rule is getting you can add the codelog/code command as follows, codesudo ipfw add 40000 allow log .../code  I chose the rulenum 40000 somewhat arbitrarily as rules exist from 1 to 65535, though certain numbers are privileged. This just makes it easier to delete the rule later, if needed.  but this caused  the response code"bad command 'allow'"/code  <comment197927> Your question is rather hard to read. Please try to put the dots and returns at end of sentences. Use "`" to clearly separate reserved words or command lines from plain english. <comment197929> This post is more appropriate as a comment on the linked post, but the OP doesn't have the rep to do so... <comment197931> @Jenelle: "The builtin firewall used by OS X is ipfw". This was true on 10.6. On 10.8, `ipfw` is still usable, but the firewall is now an application one. See `ps ax | egrep '[ /](PID|socket)'` and `/var/log/appfirewall.log`. <comment197980> Thanks Scot and Daniel.  I think I'm out of my league.  I don't understand the answer.  I'll need to do some more educating and maybe come back to it but thanks for trying to help.
