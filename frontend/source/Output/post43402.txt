Why does Mail.app automatically add iCal events from invitations I receive? <body> I sometimes receive emails with .ics file attachments. Mail.app automatically adds these events to my iCloud Calendar as soon as I preview the message.   How can I disable this behaviour and only add the event if I click on the attachment manually?  <answer43403> In the Mail.app go to Preferences-general. There is an option "Add invitations to ICal" which is Automatic or None. You need to choose None.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uhi9J.png" alt="Mail preferences"  When you have a mail with date and time in Mail.App will highlight that and clicking on that will add an event to iCal.  <comment49311> Doh! I swear I looked in the preferences - but it was hiding right there in the middle :) Thanks!
