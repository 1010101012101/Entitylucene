View last time an app was opened <body> I'm new to Mac and I want to know the last time I opened an app on my Mac and what the app was. Like for example if I opened Sublime Text at 2:04 pm how would I see that?  <answer144404> Open /Applications in Finder in list view and show the Last Opened column by right-clicking the column titles and adding the column. This will show the last time an app was opened, and sorting by that column will order by most recently used.
