Mid-2012 MBP will not boot (video attached) <body> My MBP will not boot.  strongUpdate./strong Added the SSD diagnostics output.  I have:  ul lithis mid-2012 MacBook (I think it was the latest pre-retina MBP update),/li lian SSD, Samsung 840 Pro 256Gb, installed in mid-2013. strongHere's the diagnostics output – report.txt/strong,/li liFileVault enabled./li /ul  This is how the MBP will not boot: after entering my password, it gets stuck during a (what I believe) disk decryption phase. It basically enters an endless loop of screen flickering with a relatively long period.  Here's the video of "broken" boot process: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl_vlZ8lmy8  strongAny ideas what could be causing this?/strong  I used this article's different boot mode suggestions.  strongObservations so far/strong  ul liverbose mode: it works, but I don't recognize any of errors in output log on the screen (there doesn't seem to be any notable),/li lisingle-user mode: after booting into terminal, able to walk around system folders &amp; my home folder with no problem,/li lisingle-user mode: entering "exit" command continues the boot process, yet at some point it enters the same dead boot loop as on the video (with no graphic elements though),/li lisingle-user mode: fsck worked; ran it twice. First time it said it found issues with disk but was unable to fix them, yet it generated some nodes in lost+found folder. On subsequent run it was able to fix all found issues though,/li lirecovery mode: tried reinstalling the system. It did reinstall. Then on the very first boot stuck as well. It's fair to say that before reinstall the boot would stuck during roughly 50% of the progress bar; after reinstall - at roughly 75% of the progress bar; it once made it to 100%, but at 100% it entered the dead flickering loop,/li litried running Apple Hardware Test: it stuck on "11 seconds" of checking; I waited a few minutes and the manually rebooted left the test running during the night. In the morning saw the same result: it is stuck on "11 seconds"./li /ul  strongFurther questions/strong  ul liI'm able to run any diagnostics from terminal during the single-user mode. What should I run to get more information about the problem?/li licould this be caused by some start up items that remain in my home folder?/li liare the logs of previous boot attempts stored somewhere? if yes, where can I find them for deeper analysis?/li liif this is caused by SSD, is there a self healing procedure unavailable for HDD?/li /ul  strongA speculation/strong     I emthink/em this may be SSD's fault: it cannot decrypt the disk due to broken nodes found using codefsck/code.      Now, since during the last run codefsck/code said it "fixed" something, I assume it might have somehow marked not working nodes so that the file system ignores them from now on. Yet, this cannot aid the decrypt process for reasons, similar to when you cannot unzip a corrupted ZIP file.      Since OS X re-installation worked, and since I am able to walk around the disk in a single-user boot mode – I assume SSD is indeed working to some extent.      Given that, I'm going to save as much data as I can by copying it from the SSD to an external USB-connected hard drive via codersync/code, and then wipe the SSD entirely buy formatting it from the recovery-mode UI's Disk Utility, and re-install the system once again.   I'm ready to bring the laptop to my local service center, but I want to dig as much as I'm able to.
