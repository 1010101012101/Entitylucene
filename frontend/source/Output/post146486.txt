OSX Server 10.9 File Sharing - not working properly <body> I have a 10.9 server with file sharing enabled.  One of the users decided to change the permissions on the folder and was doing some "spring cleaning" now all of my shares are not visible from the workstations except one "Home Folders"  This is the only share that has staff(primary group) where as the others and new shares have "administrators (primary group)".  How can I change this as the users that are not administrators cannot see any other shares when browsing to the server.  <answer146499> If it's the group ownerships, from the command line you could do:  precodechown -R yourusername:staff /Path/To/SharedFolder /code/pre  for each of the shares, if the other non-admin users you mentioned are in the codestaff/code group. Otherwise, replace codestaff/code with the correct group. It's possible you may emnot/em want emall/em the directories underneath the shared directory shared, so you'd have to go in and alter the permissions/ownership for each of them too, or remove the code-R/code and change folders individually.  See some examples of codechown/code here and an explanation of the command I've given here.  I'd also note down what the current ownership and permissions are using codels -l/code, so that you can change them back if this doesn't work.  (obviously, replace codeyourusername/code with your username, and code/Path/To/SharedFolder/code with the path to the shared folder. I say "obviously" but I'm writing this because, according to my experience, it's not always obvious!:)  <comment172813> I've followed your directions and have reset permissions to match on all the folders, now I'm still not seeing the folders when I browse to the server with any users except Administrators.  Any help is greatly appreciated. <comment172826> Now I'm almost convinced that it's the user accounts that are causing the issue.  When I create a new user they get denied to access the server, even though the test shares are wide open and the new user has full permissions.  thoughts? <comment172860> The directories are definitely marked as shared? http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/apple-in-the-enterprise/apple-os-x-server-configure-file-sharing/ (I know it's a stupid question but then it's probably going to be one of those things where your colleague unticked a check box somewhereâ€¦)
