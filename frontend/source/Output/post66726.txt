How to move to another full screen window of the same app <body> I have two Safari windows, I put both of them into full screen. When I switch to another app (let's say Finder) by kbdcmd/kbd-kbdtab/kbd, then the next time I switch back to Safari by kbdcmd/kbd-kbdtab/kbd, I will be in the last full screen window that I was on.  How do I move from here to my other full screened Safari window? Is there any way to do this?  I know I can move to the right/left space by kbdctrl/kbd-kbdarrow/kbd, but I have no idea where the other Safari window is (I'd have to guess).  EDIT: What I really meant is a keyboard shortcut, instead of Mission Control.  <answer66761> Just going into the main Mission control window will solve this, it will give a nice summary like view of all your open (fullscreen) windows. Another way to switch between fullscreen windows is selecting the "Window" menu item or the Safari icon in your dock and choosing the right window from there.  strongEdit/strong  If you want to use a keyboard shortcut to accomplish this you can use an application that binds a keyboard shortcut to an Apple script, like FastScripts. The next step is placing the script in your /Library/Scripts folder and adding a shortcut to the script in the FastScripts preferences.   I'm not really good with Apple scripts, but this is a sort of working script that I made:  precodetell application "Safari" activate end tell  tell application "System Events"     tell process "Safari"         tell menu bar 1             tell menu bar item "Venster"                 tell menu "Venster"                     click menu item 14                 end tell             end tell         end tell     end tell end tell /code/pre  The big problem with this script is this: The line codeclick menu item 14/code will make the first window that you see when you click on the "Window" menu item active, and changing it to codeclick menu item 15/code will make the second window active. However, obviously, this isn't included in my code, and I don't have the time to work on it today, so you can either ask someone else how to do this or wait until tomorrow.   <answer156182> I use TotalSpaces for this.  It gives you an unlimited number of virtual desktops (each can be multi-monitor) and easy keyboard and visual navigation between them.  It basically does gracefully what Mission Control fails to do (I've had Mission Control disabled for a long time thanks to TotalSpaces).  <comment78619> That's what I've been doing. I really wanted a keyboard shortcut. Sorry for not being clear enough. <comment78624> Are you ok with installing a little third party utility to run an Apple script when a keyboard shortcut is pressed? <comment78627> I can give it a try.
