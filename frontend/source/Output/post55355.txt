Add podcast-like chapters to audiobooks <body> I have a number of audiobooks that are very long (10 or more CDs).  I don't like having them all in separate files because when you leave and come back, you're scrolling through hundreds of files to find the one you were on.  Instead, I used an audio editor to combine them in to 3-5 hour files.  However, if you are scrubbing through the file and accidentally slip (lift your finger, etc), you've now lost your place in such a large file.  I have seen in some podcasts that have chapters, allowing you to use kbd|&lt;&lt;/kbd and kbd|/kbd to skip around, and keeping the scrubbing to within the chapter.  Can these be applied to audiobooks?  If not, can I tell iTunes that my book is a podcast and set them there?  I tried that once but couldn't see how to set chapter markers anywhere.    <answer55357> You can do it with Garageband on a Mac, or using a separate utility on Windows.  h2Mac with Garageband/h2  There's a detailed guide here, but the concise version is:  ol liCreate a new Podcast in Garageband./li liDelete the placeholder tracks (the Podcast track can't be deleted), then drag in the audio file you want to add chapters to./li liSelect the Podcast track, make sure the editor is open (em&#x2318;E/em)./li liMove the playhead to the position you want a chapter at, and click strongAdd Marker/strong. Repeat for each chapter position you want. You can add titles if desired./li liExport to disk or iTunes via the strongShare/strong menu./li /ol  If you want the files to appear as audiobooks in iTunes, you may need to select them (in iTunes), and change the Media Kind (emGet Info/&#x2318;I/em, Options tab) to Audiobook.  h2Windows using Chapter and Verse/h2  ol liDownload the free Chapter and Verse program. There are probably others out there, but this one seems to do the trick fairly simply and is free./li liClick emAdd Files/em to import your audio track. If it's not in AAC format, it will prompt you to convert it./li liGo to the emChapters/em tab and add your chapters as necessary./li liClick the Build button to save the file, then import it to iTunes as desired./li /ol  <answer55368> You can do that with Audiobook Binder. It's an open source app, and also available for free on the Mac App Store.  <comment63562> Guess I should have specified "within iTunes" in my question, especially since I don't have a Mac.  Related to your answer, though, does it **have** to be a podcast in order to get chapters? <comment63644> Ah, didn't realize that it was iTunes for Windows. You can do this with a free utility on Windows, but iTunes itself doesn't have that capability. There's nothing special about a podcast per se, chapter support is a feature of the mp4/m4a container used - any AAC audio in an m4a file should work. I'll update my answer to include details about the Windows utility.
