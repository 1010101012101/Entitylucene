MacBook Air (mid 2011) running OS X 10.7.2 won't stay asleep <body> I'm running OS X 10.7.2 on a MacBook Air (mid-2011). The computer seems to be waking itself up from sleep. If I go from the black apple in the menu bar and set it to sleep, it wakes up in about 10 seconds. If I let the computer sleep from being idle, then it wakes itself up within four minutes.  Here's what the console output looks like after waking up:   precode10/13/11 3:07:56.000 PM kernel: Wake reason: EHC2 10/13/11 3:07:56.000 PM kernel: The USB device HubDevice (Port 1 of Hub at 0xfa000000) may have caused a wake by issuing a remote wakeup (2) 10/13/11 3:07:56.000 PM kernel: Previous Sleep Cause: 5 10/13/11 3:07:56.000 PM kernel: The USB device Apple Internal Keyboard / Trackpad (Port 2 of Hub at 0xfa100000) may have caused a wake by issuing a remote wakeup (3) 10/13/11 3:07:56.000 PM kernel: HID tickle 140 ms 10/13/11 3:07:56.000 PM kernel: AppleUSBMultitouchDriver::checkStatus - received Status Packet, Payload 2: device was reinitialized 10/13/11 3:07:57.000 PM kernel: Sound assertion "0 == fAudioEngineArray" failed in AppleHDADriver at line 3047 goto Exit /code/pre  Does anyone have any suggestions for how to fix this?  The output is more complicated when I have the network on, but I suspect that's unrelated to the actual problem. Here's an example with my ethernet adapter plugged in:  precode10/13/11 2:33:16.507 PM Console:  Marker - Oct 13, 2011 2:33:16 PM 10/13/11 2:36:54.000 PM kernel: Ethernet [AppleUSBEthernet]: Link down on en2 10/13/11 2:36:54.000 PM kernel: AppleUSBEthernet::disable - Link down, Device eb86000 10/13/11 2:36:55.245 PM configd: setting hostname to "..." 10/13/11 2:36:55.247 PM configd: network configuration changed. 10/13/11 2:36:58.000 PM kernel: Wake reason: EHC2 10/13/11 2:36:58.000 PM kernel: The USB device HubDevice (Port 1 of Hub at 0xfa000000) may have caused a wake by issuing a remote wakeup (2) 10/13/11 2:36:58.000 PM kernel: Previous Sleep Cause: 5 10/13/11 2:36:58.000 PM kernel: The USB device Apple Internal Keyboard / Trackpad (Port 2 of Hub at 0xfa100000) may have caused a wake by issuing a remote wakeup (3) 10/13/11 2:36:58.000 PM kernel: HID tickle 141 ms 10/13/11 2:36:58.000 PM kernel: AppleUSBMultitouchDriver::checkStatus - received Status Packet, Payload 2: device was reinitialized 10/13/11 2:36:58.000 PM kernel: Sound assertion "0 == fAudioEngineArray" failed in AppleHDADriver at line 3047 goto Exit 10/13/11 2:37:01.000 PM kernel: Ethernet [AppleUSBEthernet]: Link up on en2, 100-Megabit, Full-duplex, No flow-control, Port 2, Debug [3100,782d,05e1,41e1,0001,0306] 10/13/11 2:37:02.698 PM ntpd: bind(26) AF_INET6 fe80::2a37:37ff:fe00:e2cd%4#123 flags 0x11 failed: Can't assign requested address 10/13/11 2:37:02.698 PM ntpd: unable to create socket on en2 (23) for fe80::2a37:37ff:fe00:e2cd#123 10/13/11 2:37:02.720 PM rpcsvchost: sandbox_init: com.apple.msrpc.netlogon.sb succeeded 10/13/11 2:37:03.055 PM configd: network configuration changed. 10/13/11 2:37:03.065 PM configd: setting hostname to "..." 10/13/11 2:37:08.070 PM com.apple.launchd: (com.apple.smb.preferences) Throttling respawn: Will start in 5 seconds /code/pre  Any thoughts would be really appreciated.  Thanks!  <answer27527> The logs say that it's waking from a usb. If you unplug all USB the problem should be fixed.  Also look here to make sure that the option is NOT selected : img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/w0Oxk.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer30021> I asked a similar question here. I successfully found a working solution:     "Unnecessary sharing services might interrupt the sleep process. Turning these off fixed the problem :)"   <answer31082> I'm having the exact same issue and I'm pretty sure this is a hardware-related problem (probably sound) introduced in 10.7.1 or 10.7.2. That one line always appears in the kernel.log when it wakes up within seconds of putting my iMac to sleep:  precodekernel[0]: Sound assertion "0 == fAudioEngineArray" failed in AppleHDADriver at line 3047 goto Exit /code/pre  Turning off all sharing preferences did not solve the problem. Nor did reseting the PRAM, SMC or all the other usual suspects I've attempted.  <answer42163> I was having the same problem. I disabled the "Internet Sharing" service via Sharing in System Preferences and it immediately solved my problem.  This error in the console also went away:  precodekernel: Sound assertion "0 == fAudioEngineArray" failed in AppleHDADriver at line 3047 goto Exit /code/pre  <comment31593> Thanks for the solution. Unfortunately, I don't have any USB peripherals plugged in and I have "Wake for network access" turned off. The problem still persists as described above. <comment31595> How about Bluetooth devices ? <comment31596> Also off. Could this be a hardware problem? <comment31597> The wake reason EHC2 means that it's an internal USB controller.  Things that are connected to the internal USB are : Bluetooth, Internal Keybaord/trackpad, Isight, IR Receiver, <comment31599> Thanks. Everything is unplugged (except power), bluetooth is off, no USB peripherals, my computer has no IR receiver, and I leave my keyboard/trackpad alone. This is really a mystery.
