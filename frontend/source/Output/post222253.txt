Stop Google Chrome from stealing focus on opening <body> Is there any way of preventing Google Chrome from stealing the focus when it is opening?  When I open an application, I often do the following:  ol liClick on the application icon in the dock./li likbd⌥ Option/kbd-kbd⇥ Tab/kbd away from the application while it has not yet finished opening./li liContinue working in another application while the first application is opening./li liEventually kbd⌥ Option/kbd-kbd⇥ Tab/kbd back to the first application after it has completed its opening process and is ready for use./li /ol  Now Google Chrome misbehaves in step 3. When I have kbd⌥ Option/kbd-kbd⇥ Tab/kbded away from it for working in another application, it will steal focus as soon as it has finished drawing its browser window. Instead of letting me decide to kbd⌥ Option/kbd-kbd⇥ Tab/kbd back to it at my own free will, it hijacks the process and interrupts any work I am doing.  I think this is an extremely annoying and intrusive behaviour and I would like to stop it. I do not want Google Chrome to always open in the background. It should just behave like any other app and not interfere with the choice I make by kbd⌥ Option/kbd-kbd⇥ Tab/kbdbing to another application.  I can replicate the focus stealing behaviour of Google Chrome in yet another way. When issuing the codeopen/code command on the Terminal, the code-g/code flag is supposed to tell the application to open in the background:  precodeopen -g /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/ /code/pre  Yet again, Google Chrome does not honour this choice. It begins opening in the background all right, but it steals focus as soon as it has finished drawing its browser window. Compare this to the normal behaviour of any other application:  precodeopen -g /Applications/Firefox.app/ /code/pre  This does exactly what it is supposed to do: The application opens in the background and stays in the background until I choose to kbd⌥ Option/kbd-kbd⇥ Tab/kbd to it. Is there any way to make Google Chrome behave in this way, too?
