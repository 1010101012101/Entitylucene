What is the 'Zzz' complication on Apple Watch? <body> It is shown here in an image from a Wired article on the watch before it came out. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7jLZZ.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer283052> This is the alarm complication if you choose to snooze an alarm.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IPnzs.png" alt="Snooze complication on Apple Watch 38 mm"  <comment356788> Possibly a [sleep tracker app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sleep-pulse-2-motion-sleep/id1005468883?mt=8)? <comment356797> I'd guess it's the iOS 10 bedtime feature in the Clock app? @Allan All the others are first-party, it would be odd to include a separate app in there imo <comment356803> @grgarside - I agree, but all we have is a pic of a screenshot from an unspecified Wired mag article.  All we can do is speculate. <comment356804> @Allan Of course, just saying in case you hadn't noticed <comment356807> Sorry I forgot to add the link to article and mention it was before the watch came out so it is definitely not third party. Probably a feature that got canned but I wanted to double check with everyone else.
