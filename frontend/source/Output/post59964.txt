Macbook pro retina setting resolution to 2880 restored to 1440 after restart system <body> System is Mountain Lion, these steps will reproduce the problem:  ol liSelect a primary resolution in System Preferences pannel, Displays. Select the 'Best for Retina display' (Other resolution in this pannel is also OK)./li liUse the SetResX to set the resolution to 2880x1800 (I tried some other programs, the same result)./li liRestart the system or log out the current account./li /ol  Then after login again, the resolution will restore to the resolution in setp one.  Is there a way to keep the resolution to 2880x1800 permanently?  Thanks.  <answer64502> I found a solution here:  http://wineskin.urgesoftware.com/tiki-view_blog_post.php?postId=51     This isn't exactly a Wineskin related post, but... with the new Retina   Macs not having a way to truly change the resolution, I threw together   a little app that uses the WSReso command line tool I made for older   versions of Wineskin for changing resolutions before RandR was added   to XQuartz... it uses WSReso and its just an Applescript GUI front end   that lets you change resolutions, including knocking that Retina   Display Macbook Pro up to a true 2880x1800.  Works on any Macs for   changing resolutions around... its very simple, but effective.      http://wineskin.urgesoftware.com/Special/Change Resolution.app.zip      EDIT: update      if you want to just have an app that automatically goes to your max   resolution that you can put in your startup items... use this      http://wineskin.urgesoftware.com/Special/SetRes.app.zip   <comment75756> Answers on Ask Different need to be more than just a link. It's okay to include a link, but please summarize or excerpt it in the answer. The idea is to make the answer stand alone.
