SecurityAgent Password not getting filled via AppleScript 10.11 El Capitan <body> My AppleScript no longer seems to work in 10.11. I put quite a few debug statements in my script and it doesn't seem like the script continues to run after the dialog appears. Does anyone have a workaround?  precodeon submitCredentials(localPass)     tell application "System Events"         tell process "SecurityAgent"             -- Get OS Version             set osVersion to system version of (system info)              considering numeric strings                 set isYosemite to osVersion â‰¥ "10.10"             end considering              repeat while (count of windows) is 0                 --Wait until the actual window appears             end repeat              -- Adjust field called as Window is different between 10.9 and 10.10             if isYosemite is true then                 try                     with timeout of 10 seconds                         set value of text field 2 of window 1 to localPass                         click button "OK" of window 1                     end timeout                 end try             else                 try                     with timeout of 10 seconds                         set value of text field 2 of scroll area 1 of group 1 of window 1 to localPass                         click button "OK" of group 2 of window 1                     end timeout                 end try             end if         end tell     end tell end submitCredentials /code/pre  <comment257338> Could this be a "feature" and not a bug? Looks like the same root cause as in [this issue](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/212622/keychain-wont-let-copy-passwords-after-10-11-1-update)
