Can't connect to simulator with Xcode <body> I'm using Xcode 8.3 and macOS sierra on a 2009 MacBook.  I'm getting "failed to initiate service connection to simulator" and "unable to contact local DTServiceHub to bless simulator connection" errors when I run my program.  It does compile correctly and I made sure the simulator was "added" under device manager.  Has anyone experienced this before? And does anyone have suggestions on how I can try to resolve this?
