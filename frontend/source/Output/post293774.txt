Large text selection doesn't work <body> In strongmacOS/strong, one can select text quickly and precisely using shortcuts.   Pressing kbdSHIFT/kbd and the arrow keys will select one character at a time (kbd←/kbd kbd→/kbd) or one line (kbd↑/kbd, kbd↓/kbd) at a time. And pressing kbdALT/kbd and kbdSHIFT/kbd in combination with the arrow keys will let you select each word at a time (kbd←/kbd kbd→/kbd) or from the insertion point to the very beginning or end of a document (kbd↑/kbd, kbd↓/kbd).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Enw7T.gif" alt="an animated screenshot showing a large text selection done with ALT and SHIFT and DOWN arrow"  However, I am having a hard time making it work on a larger document:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lk5eY.gif" alt="an animated screenshot showing a TextEdit document where large text selection with SHIFT and ALT and DOWN arrow doesn&#39;t work"  h2strongemWhy isn't the shortcut working in the second situation?/em/strong/h2  <answer293787> I found out what I was doing wrong.  While working on the first document, I wrongly assumed that the shortcut to jump to the end of a document was kbdSHIFT/kbd + kbdALT/kbd + kbd↓/kbd, because this shortcut selects the text till the end of the line, and the document was just one long line that wrapped.  But the actual shortcut to select till the end of the document and bypass linebreaks is kbdSHIFT/kbd + kbdCMD/kbd + kbd↓/kbd - not kbdALT/kbd.   <answer293788> kbd⇧ shift/kbd kbd⌥ alt/kbd kbd↓/kbd selects to the end of the paragraph. This works in your first example because the document contains a single paragraph.  The correct combination for selecting to the end of the document is either kbd⇧ shift/kbd kbd⌘ cmd/kbd kbd↓/kbd or kbd⇧ shift/kbd kbdend/kbd, depending on that particular application’s shortcut for scrolling to the end of the document.  Correspondingly, selecting to the beginning of the document is kbd⇧ shift/kbd kbd⌘ cmd/kbd kbd↑/kbd or kbd⇧ shift/kbd kbd↖︎ home/kbd.  And finally selecting to the start of the line is kbd⇧ shift/kbd kbd⌘ cmd/kbd kbd←/kbd, and to the end of the line kbd⇧ shift/kbd kbd⌘ cmd/kbd kbd→/kbd. Using kbd⌥ alt/kbd instead of kbd⌘ cmd/kbd selects the previous/next word, respectively.  <comment370727> you put a lots of nice work to make your question :) <comment370729> @Buscar웃 thanks! I try <comment370740> this is not an answer to your problem, just sharing alternative method I use. With cursor in front of the word, I double click to select that word, or triple click to select the whole paragraph. To select more, I place the cursor at the beginning of a word, then HOLD shift key, and click at the end of the selection.
