Mute/unmute iPhone based on location or time <body> My wife mutes her iPhone 5 at work because she has many landline phone meetings during the day and doesn't want the sound to play over her conference calls.  The problem is that she often doesn't unmute the phone when leaving work.  So, after leaving work, she will often miss calls or texts because she has muted the phone.  Is there any way to mute the phone on geographic location or time?  Ideally it would just mute within a mile of the office and unmute otherwise.  Alternatively, muting the phone 8-5 would work too, just as long as no action is needed to unmute.  <answer155274> codeSettings &gt; Do Not Disturb/code has many options available, as explained at this page:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6LTIo.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  or Apple's brief explanation here:      strongDo Not Disturb/strong      Do Not Disturb is an easy way to silence iPhone, whether you’re going   to dinner or to sleep. It keeps calls and alerts from making any   sounds or lighting up the screen.      Turn on Do Not Disturb. Swipe up from the bottom edge of the screen to   open Control Center, then tap the do not disturb button. When Do Not   Disturb is on, the do not disturb button appears in the status bar.      Note: Alarms still sound, even when Do Not Disturb is on. To make sure   iPhone stays silent, turn it off.      Configure Do Not Disturb. Go to Settings  Do Not Disturb.      You can schedule quiet hours, allow calls from your Favorites or   groups of contacts, and allow repeated calls to ring through for those   emergency situations. You can also set whether Do Not Disturb silences   iPhone only when it’s locked, or even when it’s unlocked.   Its really quite handy, but what is lacking is the ability to schedule codeDo Not Disturb/code in the Calendar app for repeats and specific times of the day. That would be sweet.  <answer276512> I just saw this software on the App Store: Auto Mute by Niv Gutherz.  It's currently $.99US and I haven't used it so I can't indicate if it works or not.
