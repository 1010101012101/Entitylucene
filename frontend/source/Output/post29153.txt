My Contacts App Crashes <body> When I am in my phone app, if I press the contacts tab, my phone app crashes. Also, if I try to open my contacts app, it crashes.  This problem just started today.  Everywhere I've looked have only found problems with iOS 5, but I have iOS 4.2.1.  <comment33498> Please provide more information: Did you reboot your iPhone yet? Do you sync your contacts via iTunes, MobileMe, Google or something else? <comment39537> Yes mine does that periodically. Apple Store genius bar finally figured out that when we remove my company's outlook exchange account the phone snaps back into shape. Then I re-add the account and it's fine for a while until it happens again. My company looked into but couldn't figure out the problem.
