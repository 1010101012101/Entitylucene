In Mavericks, how can I make Paste and Match Style the default for Cmd-V? <body> The instructions for Mountain Lion and other OSs do not seem to apply to Mavericks.  <answer118465> While it may not work in strongall/strong applications there is a way of doing this for a large number. Certainly it works in codePages/code, codeNumbers/code and codeTextEdit/code but not Microsoft Word, where you have to do it within the application.  All you need to do is open codeSystem Preferences/code  codeKeyboard/code  codeShortcuts/code and select codeApp Shortcuts/code in the left hand pane. Click on codeAll Applications/code in the right hand pane and the code+/code at the bottom.  In the codeMenu Title/code field enter codePaste and Match Style/code then click in the codeKeyboard Shortcut/code field and press kbdcommand-V/kbd. Then click on codeAdd/code  You will now see that your shortcut is added. When you open codePages/code, for example, you will see that codePaste/code no longer has a shortcut (you could add one using the same method) and right next to codePaste and Match Style/code in the codeEdit/code menu is your new working shortcut,kbdcommand-V/kbd. Oh, frabjous joy!  <answer167649> precodedefaults write .GlobalPreferences -dict-add NSUserKeyEquivalents "Paste and Match Style" -string "@v‚Äù /code/pre  <comment138222> I gave up trying to do it at the OS level and have embraced using Flycut to strip all formatting instead. https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/flycut-clipboard-manager/id442160987?mt=12 <comment138238> :) Worked like a charm!
