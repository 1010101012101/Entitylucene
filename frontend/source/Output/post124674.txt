Reset custom Mail UserHeaders settings in Terminal <body> How do I reset the following command?  precodedefaults write com.apple.mail UserHeaders '{"Reply-To" = "reply-to@address"; }' /code/pre  I had to use this workaround for a problem with the hosting provider that used the same IP address for all outgoing mail. Because of that, my mails kept ending up in Junk mailboxes. That problem is solved now. So how do I reset this command?  <answer124679> To remove all customisations to codeUserHeaders/code, use the codedelete/code verb in your codedefaults/code command:  precodedefaults delete com.apple.mail UserHeaders /code/pre  To replace the single codeReply-To/code value with a blank entry, use:  precodedefaults write com.apple.mail UserHeaders '{"Reply-To" = ""; }' /code/pre  The defaults manual page explains other available verbs.
