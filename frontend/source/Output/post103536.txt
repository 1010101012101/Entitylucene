Leopard or Lion with Photoshop 11.0? <body> I just downloaded OS7 to my iphone. To back it up on itunes it needs itunes 11.1. It wont download to my computer because I'm still running 10.5.8. If I upgrade to Snow Leopard or Lion I need to know that my old Photoshop 11.0/CS4 will still work.  <answer103539> Photoshop CS4 works with 10.4.11 and above. So yes it'll work with Snow Leopard or Lion.   There might be some minor issues on Lion. I don't know if the have been corrected since.   <comment121843> Your link seems to say 10.4.1 to 10.5.4 ... <comment121861> Weird.
