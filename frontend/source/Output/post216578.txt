You could look in /usr/local/bin and sort by time or check in the code/usr/local/Cellar/gcc49/4.9.3/bin/code folder where the binaries all actually get built as opposed to sym linked to /usr/local/bin  precodels -lrt /usr/local/bin | tail -20 /code/pre  <answer216673> The executables are named gcc-4.9 and not gcc I fixed it by going to:  precode$&gt;cd /usr/local/Cellar/gcc49/4.9.3/bin $&gt;ln -s gcc-4.9 gcc $&gt;ln -s g++-4.9 g++ $&gt; cd ~ $&gt;brew link gcc /code/pre  <comment261777> When you do the brew link & unlink commands, what does it say? <comment261778> Already linked. ok looks like the executables are named gcc-4.9 and not gcc. <comment261779> if you fixed your problem, then create an answer saying what you did, and mark it as solved. <comment373220> don't you mean `ln -s` instead of `ln -x`?
