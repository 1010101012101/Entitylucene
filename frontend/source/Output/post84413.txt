How to forceibly shut down a mac? <body> Press the power button and it'll restart and restoring the windows. Press the power button for so long and it'll sleep. When return it'll restore the whole windows.  What about if I want true restart or shut down?  <answer84426> Press and hold the power button for several seconds and your Mac will power completely off. strongemThis should only be required in the most extreme circumstances./em/strong Normally, you should shut down your Mac by clicking on  the Apple icon in the upper left corner of the menu bar and selecting codeShut Down.../code from the drop down menu.  Your applications are resuming when you log back in because you're telling OS X to restore their state when you shut down.

You'll know you have a corrupted HDD or SSD when you run Disk Utility's Verify on them.  Try Command-Space (or whatever key combination you have preset for Spotlight), and type codeTerminal/code  into the search field. When the Terminal.app launches, type  precodesudo shutdown -h now /code/pre  The Terminal.app may prompt you for an administrator password, so please type that when requested.  <comment97175> Keep pressing down the power until it shuts *off.* <comment97185> Then why when it's turned on I got the window the way it used to be there? It's like hybernating rather than shutting down. <comment97187> Pressing the power down until it shuts off is NOT recommended. See my expanded explanation and suggested answer. <comment97294> Although a corrupted disk is unlikely as they are journalled to deal with this case. (try unjournalled disks for a great risk of corruption)
