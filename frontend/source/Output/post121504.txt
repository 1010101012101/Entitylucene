Have to restart to switch external displays <body> I have a Macbook Air 2013 model that I use at work and at home. At work I hook it up to an external Dell 27" monitor via a display port adapter. At home I like to hook it up to my Samsung 40" TV.  When I get home after using the mac with the Dell monitor, I plug it into the TV and it doesn't detect the external display (the macbook blinks off briefly, as does the TV but that's it). Even if I go to preferences and hit 'Detect Displays'.  It seems to work if I restart my computer, but I would like not to have to reboot in order to switch external displays. Are there any steps I might be able to take to stop this from continuing to happen?  Edit: I have also noticed that when re-connecting to my monitor at work I can't drag certain programs (iTunes, Sublime Text, maybe others) to my external monitor. They claim to be on the monitor, but aren't visible. Restarting the computer fixes this.  <answer121505> I solved the problem in the past with two steps :   ol liIf you start your computer screen drop but the monitor connected, the display will default to the external and your notebook is turned off. /li liTo change which is the main screen you must enter the "Alignment" tab and drag the menu bar to the screen you want to be the main screen./li /ol  <comment141733> I know those points. Not sure how that affects my predicament. <comment141815> When you know the answer email me here.
