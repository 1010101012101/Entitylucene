Are there still working photo widgets? <body> Under previous Mac OS's there were widgets like "Modern Moments" and "Desk Photo" to display photos on the Dashboard. I tried them under Mac OS 10.10(.1) and they do not seem to be working. I'd like to see photos of my family/partner occasionally, e.g., when I use the Dashboard. Are there widgets that still work?  (Hope this question isn't too specific.)
