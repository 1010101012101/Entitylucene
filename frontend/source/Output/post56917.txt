How to view a PDF at its original size? <body> A friend sent me a PDF with a UI mockup claiming it is 1024x768.br It is, indeed:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DvvEt.png" alt="PDF size"  However, strongView  Actual Size/strong (kbdâŒ˜/kbdkbd0/kbd) zooms in so much that the PDF takes up almost all 1920x1200 screen estate that is available.  How do I view the PDF at its original size?  <answer56918> Turns out, there's a Preview preference that controls what actual size emactually/em means:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6fltV.png" alt="enter image description here"  If you want points to correspond directly to physical pixels, choose the first option.br (Not sure how it affects Retina displays though!)
