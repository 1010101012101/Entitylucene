macOS Sierra does not switch network locations <body> I've had this annoying problem for a while now (definitely pre-Sierra) and just reached the tipping point. I am using Network Preferences' locations feature, which let me switch between different network configurations. However, annoyingly, the switching does not work most of the time. When I switch, all the data in the Network Preferences panel change to the correct settings, I get a green dot on the left side and an information that, say, my Thunderbolt Ethernet adapter is active and connected - and yet, I cannot load any website (but the issue is not specific to Etherrnet, same thing happens with WiFi). The only way of fixing that is restarting the machine, which then turns on with exactly the same settings but also actually loading webpages.  What can be wrong and how can I fix this so I don't have to reboot daily like an old-school Windows user? I'd be very grateful for any ideas and tips...  <comment326093> Maybe is just DNS cache, try restart mDNSResponder (just kill this process). <comment327245> Just tried that, no success. It's weird as it is not 100% consistent. Sometimes it works (I have a feeling it works one way more often, say when I tried to switch from location A - B being in location B than when I switch B - A being in A).
