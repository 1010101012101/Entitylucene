Latest iWork/iLife installed via pkg, but app store showing updates available <body> I'm using a custom method to deploy the iWork/iLife pkgs to my clients and have them install. However pushing them up to the latest version via pkg results in the app store still showing an available update. It's worth noting these don't have _MASReceipts.  Examples with Keynote and iMovie:  precode# mdls /Applications/Keynote.app/ | grep kMDItemVersion kMDItemVersion          = "7.2" # mdls /Applications/iMovie.app/ | grep kMDItemVersion kMDItemVersion          = "10.1.6" /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KK3lb.png" alt="App store"  I've tried rebooting the machine and restarting the app store. I'm assuming it keeps some sort of cache file somewhere showing what updates it thinks are pending. My thoughts are that if I can delete this file/folder next time it checks it'll see the latest version is on there and not attempt to update.
