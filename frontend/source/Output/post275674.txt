MacBook Pro won't wake up sometimes <body> Every once in a while when I plug in my MacBook Pro to my Thunderbolt Display and then press some keys on my external keyboard (laptop lid is closed) to wake it up, the computer won't wake up properly. The screen will either stay black or I will see a black screen and the beachball mouse cursor.  If I open the laptop lid in this situation nothing changes. If I then unplug the monitor nothing changes either. The laptop display is blank.  The only thing I can do at this point is to hold the power button until the machine turns off and then turn it back on.  This seems to happen about once or twice a week.  I'd rather not wipe the machine because it will take a while to reinstall everything.  Any ideas how to prevent this from happening?

To reset this on your MacBook Pro, follow these steps:  ol listrongShut down your machine./strong Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out./li liUsing your built-in keyboard, press the kbdpower button/kbd emand then/em press the kbdcommand/kbdkbdoption/kbdkbdp/kbdkbdr/kbd keys.

I tried resetting NVRAM and SMC but that didn't help.  <comment346817> Have you tried plugging in the power? Have you tried hitting the keyboard on the computer itself as opposed to the external? <comment346820> Yes, I have tried unplugging the power and the display and opening the lid and hitting the keyboard on the laptop. The screen stays black or I will only see the beach ball. I have waited up to 5-10 minutes and nothing changes. <comment352933> Thanks for the advice but this didn't help. You can see my answer for what did help. <comment352935> That's great! Glad macOS Sierra resolved this for you. :)
