Why does Cmd-I in Preview do something other than advertised? <body> Somewhere after Lion (from which I upgraded to 10.10), Apple has changed the shortcut to show/hide the toolbar in Preview from kbd⌘/kbd-kbdB/kbd to kbd⌘/kbd-kbdI/kbd, at least it says so in the menu entries. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SN7WR.jpg" alt="enter image description here" But when actually using the shortcut, what pops up is (as one would expect), the info window.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/h9rY4.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Can someone explain why they would change it (probably not a constructive question), or whether this is a bug and how to rectify this and get the old behaviour back? Can this be done with assigning custom keyboard shortcuts?  <answer169096> This is probably a bug, or you've changed it yourself. Report to Apple and look with them.  You can change this by going to codeSystem Preferences -&gt; Keyboard -&gt; Shortcuts -&gt; Application Shortcuts/code and add what you want, you will have to type the exact thing such as "Show Toolbar".  I can't see for myself if it's a mistake on Apples part because I'm using Swedish on my OS X.  <answer169097> As @daGUY spotted it is a pipe "|" symbol.  But you can change it to the old short cuts.or any other that does not clash, by using the keyboard shortcuts in system Preference - App Shortcuts.  But note: I could not get it to pick up if I assigned new shortcuts to Preview.app (Show Toolbar &amp; Hide Toolbar ).  In the end I assigned the kbd⌘/kbd + kbdB/kbd for both to codeAll Applications/code  which Preview.app picked up  <answer169144> This is emnot/em a bug, although I can certainly see why it looks like one. That little symbol is a pipe ( | ), not the letter I. The pipe is the upper character on the backslash ( kbd\/kbd ) key.  So to type kbd⌘/kbd-kbd|/kbd, the physical keys you need to press are: kbd⌘/kbd-kbdShift/kbd-kbd\/kbd.  The difference between "|" and "I" was more pronounced back when Lucida Grande was the system font (in fact, this very post is set in Lucida Grande; you can see how the pipe is taller and thinner than the uppercase I). But OS X Yosemite switched the system font to Helvetica, and unfortunately the "|" and "I" now look basically identical.  <comment198583> +1 Darn it. I swear I tried it as a pipe and it did not work. But of course it does now. :-O. Think I must have forgot to hold down shift. (tired brain) <comment198617> Oh god, so simple! They should've left it on Cmd-B. <comment198618> It's strange that one has to assign it for both All applications and Preview in particular, any idea why this is? <comment198647> @oarfish   No I could not figure that out. For some reason it did not want to know. It could be just my app as I had played with it in the past. Does the same definitely happen for you. <comment198660> For me it suffices to set it for All Apps, but for Preview alone is not enough. Weird. <comment199492> Would be interesting to know why this was down voted?
