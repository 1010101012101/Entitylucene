How to sync connected USB HDD with Dropbox <body> I want to be able to sync my external HDD drive with DropBox, however, as soon as I eject the volume, Dropbox would think that I have deleted it.  How would I be able to sync my external HDD with Dropbox and Boxcryptor on macOS? I am fine with using terminal and other advanced tools in order to solve this issue.  The way how I was able to make my HDD sync with Dropbox was by creating a symbolic link on the Desktop by running the command codecd ~/Desktop; ln -s /Volumes/myHDD/code. I then went into my Boxcryptor folder and created the symbolic link in there by code/Volumes/iProgram/Boxcryptor/Dropbox; ln -s ~/Desktop/myHDD/code.  I had to sync my files like this because if I were to create the symbolic link in my Boxcryptor Dropbox folder, it would give me an error saying that it is read only.
