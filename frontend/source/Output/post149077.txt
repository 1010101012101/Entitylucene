Is there a way to have different songs on your iPod Touch with different fonts for each one of them? <body> I was trying to add fonts to my iPod touch 4G to use it for the music app and notes app through Bytafont app (yes, my iPod is jailbroken).  I want to get these img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CbM6p.png" alt="some glyphs"  on some Led Zeppelin songs  There's an existing font which includes those symbols (Led Zeppelin 2, I guess).  Can I add the font and use it only for some songs? Is there a cydia tweak for that? Or should start developing one?  <answer149092> No, there isn't such a tweak which allows to add them just to some songs. Only for the whole app.  <comment176888> So what's that tweak?
