Change encrypted internal HD permissions to prevent password prompts <body> I have an iMac (running OS X 10.11.3) with a dual disk setup. A ssd for the OS (with Filevault turned on) and a HDD for storage that is formatted OS X Extended and Encrypted.  The intention is to symlink some user directories onto the storage HD.  The problem that I have is when I try to delete files on the storage HD I am prompted for a password (the user password as opposed to the password for the encryption). Also when I move files on the storage HD they are essentially copied as opposed to moved.  I have tried:  precodesudo chown -Rv username directory /code/pre  but that hasn't worked.  I have also tried changing the Sharing and Permissions privilege settings to Read &amp; Write for all folders and files but that hasn't worked either.  Anybody with any advice would be greatly appreciated, thanks.  <answer228971> OK, I found a solution. If anybody would like to correct my approach please let me know.  precodeWith the storage drive (get info) -&gt;  Sharing &amp; Permisions -&gt;  Checked 'Ignore ownership on this volume' /code/pre  The next step might have been made redundant by the previous step, but I also did the following:  precodeDirectory on storage drive with user directories -&gt;  Sharing &amp; Permission -&gt;  My User Profile, Read &amp; Write /code/pre  This appears to have done the job, can delete and move items as expected.
