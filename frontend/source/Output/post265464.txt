Apple Mail Attachment Reminder <body> a) Does anyone know of a good plugin to check your message for mention of an attachment that reminds you to attach something if you hit send with no attachment?  OR  b) Does anyone know how to fire an AppleScript in the mail app after the send button is hit and before it actually sends?  <answer265482> I have been using MailButler for quite some time now. It is an amazing plugin for Apple mail. With read tracking, undo send strongand/strong a notification when you mention something like the word "attachment" but not attach anything!
