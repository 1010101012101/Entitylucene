Alternative to Preview app to search for text in multiple documents at the same time <body> I need to search for texts in several codePDF/code at the same time. codePreview/code does the job: I select the files in the Finder and open them together in codePreview/code. Then, searching for some text happens simultaneously in all the codePDF/code: great! But is very unstable. When searching, it often crashes.  Is there an alternative to codePreview/code with the same feature?  My system is 10.11.6 and Preview is 8.1  <answer266379> strongUse Spotlight./strong     Spotlight is a system-wide desktop search feature of Apple's macOS and   iOS operating systems. Spotlight is a selection-based search system,   which creates an index of all items and files on the system. It is   designed to allow the user to quickly locate a wide variety of items   on the computer, including documents, pictures, music, applications,   and System Preferences. In addition, specific words in documents and   in web pages in a web browser's history or bookmarks can be searched.   It also allows the user to narrow down searches with creation dates,   modification dates, sizes, types and other attributes.   With Spotlight you can do advanced searches and filter for example on file extensions like code.pdf/code.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bX5dh.png" alt="Finder Spotlight"  <comment333999> Evernote Premium and DevonTHINK apps can search in PDF files, but they all are not free. <comment334013> Yes good idea @pjctech
