FaceTime added to Dock on Start Up <body> I've encountered an interesting issue, and I am wondering if anyone else has experience with it.  Every time I restart my Mac, FaceTime is added back to the Dock. If I remove it from the Dock, it disappears. Restart, and it's back. I can remove other things just fine and they stay where they are, if I re-arrange FaceTime in the Dock it stays in its new position. Only when I remove it does something put it back.  Recent System Changes that emmight/em be causing it:  ul liEFI Update was just installed, it seemed to start happening as soon as it rebooted from installing this./li liXCode was upgrade from 4.0.1 to 4.0.2/li /ul  Things I've tried:  ul liDeleting the ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dock.plist and rebuilt my Dock from scratch. After restarting, everything was exactly where I wanted it except the FaceTime app was added back./li /ul  (Anything else I try, I will edit and post here)  Has anyone else had problems with applications getting "stuck" in the Dock? How'd you fix it? FaceTime is neat, and I use it occasionally, but it isn't worth a dedicated spot on the Dock.  <answer13701> Open Activity Monitor, kill the "apsd-ft" process, remove FaceTime and then install it again.  There's also another solution I found on google (link here):     I was able to finally fix the problem by using the option in Onyx for LaunchServices rebuild. No more Facetime icon on reboot.   <answer20412> This could be caused if your machine is managed -- more accurately, if your machine connected to an open directory server. Or perhaps to a OS X lion server, managing your machine's preferences.  <answer32174> Remove them from your dock, then go under the go tab in finder to your hard drive, then to library, and then in the prefences folder find codecom.apple.dockfixup.plist/code and move it to the recycle bin. Problem solved. This worked for me and I am running Lion so, hopefully it will work for you...  <comment14574> That did not resolve my issue. Removing FaceTime altogether and restarting resulted in a "?" appearing in the Dock, and rebuilding LaunchServices did not do the trick either. The application isn't running when I boot, it's just been "Kept" in the Dock. <comment14575> This is very odd indeed. Sorry I couldn't help you. <comment26730> It can even be managed locally by a policy file - stranger things have happened ;-) <comment27047> My issue was similar to this. Thanks for the push in the right direction.
