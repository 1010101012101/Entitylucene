Infrared pairing issues <body> since I have 2 Apple Remotes, one for my MacBook Pro and another one for Apple TV, I tried to pair them. On Apple TV this has just worked fine, but my MacBook doesn't want to pair with any of the remotes. The infrared port seems to work just fine, as sometimes when I use the remote paired with Apple TV, it also starts playing a song in iTunes on the MacBook Pro, which is quite annoying. That's also the main reason to look for a solution here. Also the other unpaired remote – that one I would like to pair with the MBP – works just fine with it.  Is there any preference file or else which could cause that? I doubt it's a hardware issue since remote controlling in general works just fine...  Thanks!
