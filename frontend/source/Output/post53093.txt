Why is iPhone battery percentage fluctuating at lower levels? <body> My iPhone 4 (going on 19 months of love) has recently started having a bit of an issue knowing the percentage of its battery it has remaining.  I will be using it and it will jump from 31% to 19% and pop up that annoying "Low Battery" notification.  A few moments after I dismiss it, the percentage jumps back up to 27%. This happens at least ten times, reliably, before it starts hitting 11% and then I know it was "real" and it needs charging soon. This feels like a NiCad issueâ€¦ I know we've advanced past those days.  So my question is: stronghow can I force a calibration of the percentage counter on iPhone 4/strong?  Alternatively, and I don't know that I would like this even if it is possible (I doubt it is), can I disable the "Low Battery" notification?  It is excessively annoying when it pops up ten times over the course of thirty minutes.   <answer53097> To recalibrate your iPhones battery, you should:  ol liUse the iPhone until it strongshuts off/strong due to low battery./li liCharge it, without interruptions, to full charge (100%)./li liReset the iPhone by Holding strongHome/strong and the strongPower/strong buttons at the same time. Ignore the emSlide to Power off/em,  and let the iPhone restart itself./li /ol  And for the notifications, as far as I know, no such thing can be achieved without jailbreaking. Cydia's app LowPowerBanner, for instance, should do the trick, though.   <comment60690> Token response: Have you tried backing up your iPhone and then restoring it to factory settings using iTunes? If not, try that, see if it fixes your problem. <comment60704> To clarify: Reset iPhone while still plugged in at 100% charge, or unplug iPhone first?  I will be trying this out today and will report how well it works. <comment60705> As far as I know, it doesn't matter. I do it unplugged, though. <comment60899> This appears to have fixed my issue.  Thanks! <comment330234> This doesn't appear to have solved the issue for me. Mine goes crazy. I just looked at it at 54%, then suddenly it went to 11%, plugged it in and it said 83%. This happens all the time regardless of use. Using a 2 yo iPhone 6.
