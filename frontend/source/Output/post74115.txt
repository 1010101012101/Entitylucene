Why does Xcode still show up as an available update in App Store after being installed? <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ctqf9.png" alt="Screenshot of App Store"  I have installed the update shown from the App Store. I have since started and used XCode. Why does this update still show up in the updates list for App Store?  Is there some extra action I need to take to complete the update?   Link to screenshot: http://d.pr/i/dp3z  <answer80756> For me this was because I had 2 different versions of xcode one in code/Applications/code and another in code/Developer/Applications/code  if you copy the current version from code/Applications/code into code/Developer/Applications/code overwriting the old version that's there, it should disappear from the updates section when you restart the App Store.  I believe this issue was caused by upgrading from Snow Leopard to Lion.  <answer80929> Was having the same problem after installing Xcode v4.6 on a system with Mountain Lion, had Xcode v4.5.2 &amp; v4.4.1 (with different names) also installed in the Applications directory. Read on a different thread that Spotlight indices can sometimes cause problems, followed the steps outlined here:  http://support.apple.com/kb/ht2409  This fixed my problem. (YMMV)  <comment86137> Your screenshot didn't show up. Did you already download and install the update? I assume so, but would be good to confirm. <comment86162> What does XcodeAbout Xcode say? <comment86178> About Xcode says version 4.5.2 <comment86179> This may be a stupid question, but is this after quitting the app store app? I have noticed that this page doesn't refresh. <comment86181> Been happening for a while, AppStore has been quit and reopened. Hell the whole machine gets shut down every night. <comment86196> I've noticed the App Store is a bit flaky with clearing installed updates: I've even gotten notifications that updates are available only to find myself looking at the screenshot above. :P <comment125133> In my case I had an old xCode.app sitting in a subdirectory in my Applications folder because I'd re-downloaded it to pull out the simulator and SDK.
