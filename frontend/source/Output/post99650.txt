Can I change sensitivity of line input level? (as opposed to setting the volume) <body> I'm connecting a standard stereo tape output to an iMac line input socket. Setting input level in System Preferences  Sound  Input  Line In requires the slider to be barely "off the stop" before the blue level meter hits hard right.  Can I lower the line input sensitivity somehow?  There's no output level control on the tape output.  I'm running Mountain Lion.  <answer99657> Have you tried using LineIn by Rogue Amoeba?  <comment117264> No, but thank you for the link ... I will give it a try. <comment117269> It doesn't do what I would like - not even a volume control.  So temporarily I'm padding the line down with a few 10k resistors (real old school stuff!).
