How to insert up arrow in microsoft word for mac using keyboard shortcut? <body> Is there a way to insert uparrow that is not a wingding in word with a keyboard shortcut? Whenever I insert the symbol from the character browser it switches my font to wingdings and it's frustrating because then I have to manually switch back to the original font.  <answer129132> Use something like Dash (Free with IAP) or TextExpander (Paid) to define custom shortcuts for those symbols. Next time you want to insert codeUp Arrow/code, you just have to type code.upar/code and it won’t change your fonts (since they’re pasted as plain text).  strongUpdate:/strong I didn’t realize that you change the font manually. This still can be solved with TextExpander (but not Dash). All you need to is to choose Rich Text (selecting font that have codeUp Arrow/code) for the expanded custom arrow, and put a space afterward in the font you use in Microsoft Words.  Eg. You use strongMonotype Corsiva/strong in Microsoft Words — by assuming that it doesn’t contain codeUp Arrow/code. Define your expanded words where codeUp Arrow/code is selected as strongLucida Grande/strong that supports arrows. Right after the arrow, change the space into strongMonotype Corsiva/strong. This way, you use two fonts in Microsoft Words, but only codeUp Arrow/code is in Lucida Grande.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Maqgu.gif" alt="Custom Up Arrow Shortcuts for Mac"  P.S. There is an Alfred’s worflow called Symbols that lets you search through the unicode, paste it into your active Text Editor. Take a look at how it works.  <answer143912> I think that must be a Word "feature" to change to Wingdings, instead of an OS function.   If this is something you need frequently, you can try this solution from @0942v865:  To summarize: copy your favorite arrow symbol and put it into a text file.    precode{     "~a" = ("insertText:", "⬆"); } /code/pre  Save it to: code~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict/code  (You will probably have to create the folder.)  Restart your application, and now you should be able to type kbdoption/kbdkbda/kbd (a for arrow) to get an up-arrow...  <comment151150> What is your original font?  Does it contain an uparrow? If not, there is no way to avoid changing the font. <comment151151> The font will of course have to change if the one being used does not have an uparrow in it, plain text does not change that fact. <comment151153> I didn’t notice this one. It sounds to me that he can use **Up Arrow** if other font is selected. I’ll update the answer. <comment151154> If he doesn't want to change his fonts, he has to use an "original" font that has uparrow in it. <comment151240> Times New Roman or Arial? <comment151241> I don't have the powerpack for alfred :/ you need it to add workflows right? <comment151245> @user45467 yes, you need Powerpack to use Alfred, but you probably don’t need it for your problem. Check out my updated that users TextExpander for text replacement.
