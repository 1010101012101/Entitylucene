Modifing a preference via applescript changes file group <body> I recently request help about modifying firewall settings via command-line (see my previous question).br Everything is working, but I have noticed that whenever I use this command in an applescript, the file group changes from codewheel/code to codestaff/code.    Before:  precode-rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel /code/pre  After running the script:  precode-rw-r--r--  1 root  staff /code/pre  Repairing Disk Permissions fixed the issue but change it to codeadmin/code instead of codewheel/code.  After fixing permissions:  precode-rw-r--r--  1 root  admin /code/pre  However, I want to know:    ol liWhy is this happening, and/li liif it can raise security issues?/li /ol  <answer187698> In short, it doesn't matter.  codels -l/code print out consists of status (10 character), number of links, owner, group, etc.  Of the first 10 characters describe file type(1), owner permission(3), group permission, and permission for others. In the case of  precode -rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel /code/pre  File type: code-/code means regular file.  Owner Permission: coderw-/code means user coderoot/code can read and write.  Group Permission: coder--/code means user(s) in group codewheel/code can read only.  Others: coder--/code means user(s) not in group codewheel/code can also read only.  So you don't have to read the rest to know there is not security risk for what the group is.  So what are the users in codewheel/code, codeadmin/code and codestaff/code?  precode$dscacheutil -q group -a name wheel; dscacheutil -q group -a name staff; dscacheutil -q group -a name admin /code/pre  You get:  precodename: wheel password: * gid: 0 users: root   name: staff password: * gid: 20 users: root   name: admin password: * gid: 80 users: root YourUserNameHere /code/pre  codewheel/code is a legacy thing from UNIX. OS X never bothered to change it. When you codesudo/code the file, codesudo/code automatically use group codestaff/code. If you don't want the group name to change on the file, do:  precodesudo -g wheel defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.alf globalstate -int 2 /code/pre  <comment222104> I knew how to read the file permissions, but I didn't know about the wheel/staff groups relation. Thanks for clarify this.
