Re-using MacBook Screen <body> I have a MacBook Pro 15" around 2009, that isn't working. Is it possible to take its screen and turn it into an external monitor? Maybe buy some controller and do a little soldering?  <answer119942> You will need an LCD Controller board kit http://b2cqshop.com/products/972-lcd-controller-board-kit-rtd2270l-driver-lvds-turn-your-lcd-into-monitor.aspx  Find the model number and send it to them, and they should be able to help.  <answer168929> That is a great idea. I am wondering why there is not more guys out there busy with turning old laptop lcd's in to new, cheap and eccentric monitors.  <comment139937> Thank you! But is there a kit with HDMI? And will hdmi even support resolutions under Full HD?
