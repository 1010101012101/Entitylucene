Grey folder in iCloud Drive <body> I have a grey folder on my Mac in the iCloud Drive Directory which I can't access. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hnF3V.png" alt="enter image description here"  If I go to the iCloud Drive Website I see the folder and can easily navigate in it.  Does anyone know a solution on how to enable this folder on my machine as well?  <answer224043> So I fixed it by using the terminal. I moved all the content of the grayed out folder and to a new one.  //edit: a more detailed description on how I solved this problem:  ol liwith the help of the terminal I moved all the files in the strange behaving folder to a new location. Using the codemv/code command. E.g. codecp ~/Library/Mobile\ Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/YOUR_BROKEN_FOLDER/* ~/Documents/code (the * is for all the files)./li liOnce this folder it empty you can safely remove it with the coderm -f/code command. E.g. coderm -rf ~/Library/Mobile\ Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/YOUR_BROKEN_FOLDER/code/li liIf you want you can now recreate the folder normal in the finder and it should appear normal again./li /ol  <comment271647> [Relevant](http://www.macissues.com/2015/01/27/fix-inaccessible-and-grayed-out-folders-in-the-os-x-finder/) <comment321734> This would be a more helpful answer if you added the specific steps by which you achieved a resolution to your problem. <comment322097> @smspaulb done :) <comment322204> thanks, very helpful now!
