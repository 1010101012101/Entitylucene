How do I add German public holidays to my Outlook 2016 OSX App <body> How do I add German public holidays to my Outlook 2016 OSX App?  I currently have the UK holidays but want to add the German ones.  <answer235746> From the official Outlook website:  ol liOn the File menu, click Import./li liClick Holidays, and then click the right arrow./li liSelect the countries/regions or religions whose holidays you want to import, and then click the right arrow./li liClick OK, and then click Finish./li /ol  Otherwise, you can download the German calendar and manually import on Outlook, doing the following:  ol liGo to this website (2016 ICAL CALENDAR HOLIDAYS - ICAL, GOOGLE &amp; OUTLOOK)./li liScroll the list, till you find the German holiday calendar and download it./li liImport the downloaded file on Outlook, and it's done./li /ol  <answer283893> It’s true, in Mac Office 2016 there’s no longer an option to add holidays. Also, you can’t download a *.ics calendar file and import it into Mac Office 2016. Both workaround only apply to strongMac Office 2011/strong, only.  The only way around this is to add your Exchange/CalDAV account to Apple Calendar App. Than import your German-Holiday.ics file to your Exchange account. Finally open Outlook and wait until all calendar items have been synced.  <comment291778> There is no option (2) Holidays in OSX 2016 <comment358008> Both answer do not work no longer with Outlook 2016.
