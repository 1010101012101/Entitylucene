Yosemite - Repeated Kernel Panics - ASP_TCP.C <body> I'm starting to run into repeated Kernel Panics. My Retina iMac (no user-installed memory) has begun panicing repeatedly since March 2nd. An example log is shown below, and it is ALWAYS the same crash on exactly the same code.  I can't reproduce the issue, but the system will panic even when I'm not doing anything on it. The extensions involved make me think there's a network peculiarity involved, but I don't know how to resolve this. Any advice?

I have the impression that these crashes only occur when the network here is heavily taxed (my interim apartment's router is old enough to be in high school). I'll try disabling time machine for a day to see if this stops the problem. <comment207865> For clarity, the system is using Time Machine to back up to a Mac Mini running OS X Server. <comment207869> The reasons i was asking are: asp-tcp/filesystems.afpfs are related to AFP and diskimages-helper might be related to Time Machine backups on external shares. How are the 2 Macs connected? Via Wi-fi or ethernet? <comment207898> iMac is connected to router via wifi, as is a MacBook Pro. The Mac Mini is connected to the router with ethernet. <comment208222> What's the result of disabling Time Machine for a day or two? <comment208518> It appears to have halted the problem; there's been no panics since I disabled time machine. Which then prompts the question, WTH is Time Machine causing panics?
