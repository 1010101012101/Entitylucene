How to add Time Capsule to neighbor's über fast network <body> I wish to add my Time Capsule to my neighbor's über fast network. I have their permission and WiFi password. But their router is non-Apple.  What are my options? One is an ethernet connection to their router with my Time Capsule and configure as a roaming network.  Are there other options that would allow me to physically keep the Time Capsule in my house?  <comment121894> Keeping the Time capsule in your home and connecting it WiFi to the neighbors Netgear router? I do not think so! <comment121895> If you connect it with Ethernet cable directly to the router then yes!
