Remove from recents <body> If you start to enter a phone number (a deleted contact) and it pops up with the options to call, FaceTime, send message... Under in red it says remove from recents. Does this mean that number has been called or texted recently?  <comment187385> 'recent' is relativeâ€¦ though idk the exact storage duration/number of entries, it could mean last year if you don't call many numbers. Any number ever contacted spends at least some time in recents - you can't use it as evidence your boyfriend called his ex, for example ;)
