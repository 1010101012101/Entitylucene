Looking for a typing tutor app <body> Years ago, I learned typing by a program named Typing Tutor, on DOS. XD  Now, my son is using a MacBook and I am teaching him how to type. What software/website you recommend to learn typing on a MacBook?  <answer112796> h2strongTypist/strong/h2  Typist is a great free app for learning to type, and whilst it's not going to win any design awards, it's great at what it does, especially for free.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kH7tB.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer112838> h2TypeQuick/h2  I learned to type in Australia 20+ years ago using software called TypeQuick, while I was in high school.  They are still around, and do their software. They now provide an on on-line course specifically for kids.  The price is AU$30.  <answer112943> I have used Master Key to practice typing some plain text books. It's shareware and you'll have to buy a license to unlock some of the lessons though.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/e5NdH.png" alt=""  <answer125450> bThe Typing Cat/b  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SRdtH.png" alt="enter image description here"  I like it because:  ul liit's free/li lifast/li ligives nice progress/li lisupports multiple layouts (qwerty, dvorak, colemak, workman)/li lilooks good/li liYou don't need to install anything - it's webapp/li lii'm creator and i'm proud of it and made it as sideeffect of teaching myself Colemak.
