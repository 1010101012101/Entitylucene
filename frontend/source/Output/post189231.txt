How to upload pdf or, docs in safari or any popular browser in iOS? <body> I was just stunned today, when I just discovered that I cannot upload my resume either in pdf/doc while applying for a job.   All I have access to is Photos, which is my photos and videos repository.   Is there actually a way to upload documents in safari or it is just not allowed in iPhones or iOS.   <answer189236> Using the normal "choose file" buttons found on most webpages, no. Unfortunately, on iOS, that button really means "choose photos". I think some websites let you upload a file from Dropbox, which is the only workaround I know of.  <answer189334> Yah, Safari does not support file uploading, even via a web upload form... sigh. However there are a number of ways to upload from an IOS device. here are two:  ol liDropbox, this has the benefit of having access to a large number of files and is free for most, depending on how many files you have. But you cant upload to web forms directly from Dropbox./li liiCab, I've used this browser for a couple of years for just the reason you indicate. It allows you to upload (and download) files. I have not needed to do it for a while so I am not sure about the source for the files to be uploaded but I am pretty sure it includes Dropbox. It's not free but only a couple of bucks and well worth it./li /ol
