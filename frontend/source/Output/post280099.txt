Apache on MacOS Sierra: AH00557: httpd: apr_sockaddr_info_get() failed for Macbook-Pro.local AH00558: httpd: Could not reliably determineâ€¦ <body> I updated MacOS Sierra's Apache and PHP, and now whenever I code$ sudo apachectl restart/code I get this:  precodeAH00557: httpd: apr_sockaddr_info_get() failed for My-MacBook-Pro.local AH00558: httpd: Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name, using 127.0.0.1.

Keep in mind that this is for the main server.  You can set individual server names in the codeVirtualHost/code definitions  For instance, if you called the server - codemywebser.local/code, that should be the ServerName.  Personally, what I like to do, even in a home setup is to have a main definition that goes nowhere  and is very restrictive and create virtual hosts in separate directories so each one can be referenced by a different hostname.  <answer283925> When restart the httpd.  Try:  precodesudo /usr/sbin/apachectl restart /code/pre  Don't use:  precodesudo apachectl restart /code/pre  <answer285445> ol liWhen restart the httpd, you should check codewhich apachectl/code./li liTrying restart system apache server by codesudo /usr/sbin/apachectl restart/code. /li liIf you install httpd24 via brew, you should edit your custom apache config.  Try codeopen $(brew --prefix)/etc/apache2/2.4/httpd.conf/code, edit the code#ServerName www.example.com:80/code to codeServerName www.your-server.com:80/code.  Then codesudo apachectl restart/code will work./li /ol  <comment358051> How did you update Apache and PHP and why because usually it's not recommended to modify the **system's** Apache & PHP <comment358933> It worked, would you explain more why do I use `sudo /usr/sbin/apachectl restart` ? <comment359255> It's because you have two different installations of Apache - the one that came with the system and the one you installed yourself.
