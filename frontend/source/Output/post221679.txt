How do I zoom without a trackpad in Xcode Instruments Time Profiler? <body> When using Xcode Instruments Time Profiler on my MacBook, I'm able to pinch to zoom in on the CPU measurements in the Swim-lane. However I cannot figure out how to do the equivalent on my iMac with no trackpad.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yYUTC.png" alt="Xcode Swim-lane screenshot"  How can I zoom in on a Swim-lane without a trackpad?  <answer221683> If your mouse has a wheel or touch - hold the option key and then use the scroll wheel / scroll gesture or control.   If you don't have that - you'll need to add a mouse with a wheel or add a trackpad to the iMac.  <comment268475> perfect, thank you. I figured out the option click drag to zoom but failed to try using the magic mouse 'wheel' gesture. Thank you! <comment268476> I had to break out a mouse to test this :-)
