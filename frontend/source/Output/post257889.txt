Removing items from Reading List in OS X/Safari <body> How do I delete items from the Reading List in OS X/Safari? Little grey X does not show up, which is what it says to click on?  <answer258485> To delete a single item from Safari's Reading List, kbdControl/kbd + strongClick/strong  (or right click) the item and select strongRemove Item/strong:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dDZEb.png" alt="Reading List Contextual menu"  <answer270042> Like on an iPhone, use 2 fingers and swipe from right-to-left on the Reading List item.  A red button indicating "Remove" will come up.  Just click on that button to remove the item.  <comment322234> Possible duplicate of [How to clear ALL items from Safari's reading list?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/96849/how-to-clear-all-items-from-safaris-reading-list) <comment322235> @fsb, NKO is not asking explicitly asking how to clear all as in what you are pointing to as a possible duplicate. <comment322236> @NKO, When I have my Reading List showing, I have to mouse-over any given item in the list for the close (x) button to show for that item. It appears in the upper right-hand side corner of the item. Are your sure the Browser has focus when mousing-over the Reading List? <comment322238> OP indicated "items" so it could be all. Also, several answers on that question show how to delete individually and OP didn't indicate what was already tried other than the 'x'. <comment322240> @NKO, What version of Apple's Desktop OS are you running, and what version of Safari? <comment322254> Swipe the item to the left and it goes red and offers deletion. <comment339308> Or just keep swiping!
