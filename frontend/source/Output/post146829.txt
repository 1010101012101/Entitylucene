Remove full name from login window <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/M4BNM.png" alt="enter image description here"In Mountain Lion, my full name is displayed at the bottom of the log in menu. As I want to sell my computer, I was wondering if there is a way to hide this? (it's the only place that you can see it as it is not the user name, and I can't change it in Sharing preferences).  I called Apple support, they told me there's a way to do it via Terminal, but they wanted to charge me for that. I looked up online, but I can't find a way to remove it.  <answer146831> Go to strongSystem Preferences/strong → strongSecurity &amp; Privacy/strong → strongGeneral/strong and uncheck strongShow a message when the screen is locked/strong  <answer146832> Is this in the list of previously logged in users?  If you're selling your MacBook, you should consider re-installing the OS with a clean slate, rather than potentially leaving items behind.  You might find there's still a userid on the computer somewhere; you can remove it by running codesudo dscl/code and then codels /Local/Default/Users/code to see if the username shows up there. codedelete /Local/Default/Users/name/code should get rid of it.  <comment172988> It's not the user name what I want to change, and either the computer's name (at least the one showing up on Sharing preferences). I'm tying to upload a picture for you. <comment172990> It's not a user or my computer's name… I can't re'intall the OS because the guy who is about to buy it wants some software I have already installed. I'm going to upload a picture of the login window. <comment172991> @Matt Ah, I believe I know what you are referring to now—see my edited answer <comment172992> Thank you! That's it!
