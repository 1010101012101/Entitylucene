graphics card possibly broken <body> Lines have been appearing on my Mac Book Pro. I took a screenshot of this and after I took the screenshot more lines were added to it:img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ELL0H.jpg" alt="enter image description here" I have been told that this is a graphics card problem. Is there a way to confirm this?  <comment360662> Try running [Apple Hardware Test (AHT)](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201257).  Hold the D key while booting from a powered off state with the AC adapter connected. <comment360663> I ran the test and it said that nothing was broken. If that is true then what is causing the lines? <comment360674> I'm not seeing lines, just a few random dots. We'd need an actual photo of the screen to compare & eliminate hardware/software. Hardware issues normally don't appear on screenshots. <comment360681> I added a new picture.
