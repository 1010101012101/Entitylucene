How can I burn an OS X Lion install DVD once the installer has been auto-deleted? <body> I've just installed OS X Lion on my iMac, and I want to make an installation DVD, so that I can reinstall without having to first install Snow Leopard.  The way to create the DVD is answered elsewhere, but it seems that the installer gets auto deleted after the installation of Lion completes.  It looks like I'll have to re-download the 4Gb Lion installer again, but when I try to download it again via the App store, I'm told a newer version already exists, and I'll have to move it to the trash first.  I've double checked, and there isn't another version of the installer present.  How can I now create the install disk?  <answer17818> You can re-download Lion even though it has already been installed by holding down the kbdoption/kbd key before clicking strongPurchased/strong.   Do not release the key until after the option to strongInstall/strong appears alongside strongOS X Lion/strong.  The workaround may be more reliable if something emother/em than Purchased is in foreground embefore/em alt/option-clicking Purchased.   Burn the installer to disc, then delete it when you're done with it.  <comment19484> Brilliant thanks. Working perfectly. <comment19527> Holding down option didn't work for me...any other ideas? <comment19649> @Steve: hold Option key while clicking 'Purchased' tab.
