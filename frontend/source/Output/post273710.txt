MAMP very slow to serve pages using Virtual Hosts on OSX Sierra <body> I am running MAMP 4.1.1 on my mac mini with OSX Sierra (10.12.3).  lately when I try to load pages for a site using a virtual host, it is VERY slow to load.    if i load pages without a virtual host it comes up very quick.  precode127.0.0.1       localhost 255.255.255.255 broadcasthost ::1             localhost fe80::1%lo0     localhost  127.0.0.1       mydevsite.com fe80::1%lo0     mydevsite.com /code/pre  in my httpd-vhosts.conf file I have the following:  precodeNameVirtualHost 127.0.0.1:80 NameVirtualHost mydevsite.com:80  &lt;VirtualHost 0.0.0.0:80&gt; DocumentRoot "/Applications/MAMP/htdocs/mydevsite.com" ServerName mydevsite.com &lt;/VirtualHost&gt; /code/pre  Can anyone provide some guidance on how to troubleshoot this further to get my local sites using virtual hosts to server quickly?
