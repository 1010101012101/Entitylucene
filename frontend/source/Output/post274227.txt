Is Etrecheck safe to use and is this safe place to download? <body> I wanted to check my system and heard about EtreCheck.  1) Is it safe app to use?  2) Is this safe place to download it from?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Pimwc.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer274231> Yes, Etrecheck is safe to use.  And yes, you should definitely download it from the official website.  Countless people (myself included) have used Etrecheck as a troubleshooting tool. In fact, if you browse Apple's support communities you'll see it often used there as a troubleshooting tool.  <comment344738> Not sure if it's a safe app, but the website of the maker (that website you have there, etrecheck.com) is indeed where you should download it from if you do.
