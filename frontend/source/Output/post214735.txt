Reverting back to Mavericks from El Capitan <body> Ever since I downloaded El Capitan I have lost the ability to Drag &amp; Drop photos into Pages documents I am creating.  Also in Pages, Certificate templates, for example, are not able to be edited.  I can open the template but can not do anything with it, cannot edit any changes.  Also cannot edit my own created files.  I also don't like how in Photos my photo labels are not visible underneath the photo like they used to be.  I don't know what other unpleasantness might still  be in store for me so I want to revert back to Mavericks.  How do I do this?  <answer214797> There is no real way to easily downgrade any version of Mac OS. You have two choices here.  ol liIf you made a backup image of your HD before you upgraded, back up the files that have changed since then, boot from that image and restore it to your boot drive./li liBack up your current HD, Wipe it and reinstall the previous OS. Then reinstall your apps and restore your data from the backup./li /ol  Honestly sounds more like an issue with Pages than with the OS, but since I don't use Pages I have nothing useful to suggest other than removing and reinstalling the app. Perhaps if you edited your question asking for help with Pages on El Cap....  <comment259422> If you want help in solving the problems you are facing in Pages and Photos, please use "Ask Question" to ask a specific question *for each* of the problems.
