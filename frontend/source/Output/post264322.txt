Does a Diagnostics & Usage entry imply an app was installed? <body> If an app has an entry in Diagnostics &amp; Usage on a particular day, does that imply that it was installed on that day?  <answer264325> The entries you're seeing in Diagnostics and Usage are crash logs for applications on your device.  If a crash log exists for an app, then yes it means it was installed on your device at the time of the crash.  <comment331185> I assume it was, yes.
