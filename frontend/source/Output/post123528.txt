Clean Windows 8 install on new Mac Pro (late 2013) <body> I have a new Mac Pro that I want to install windows 8.1 on.  I will use my older mac pro for osx and on the new mac pro, I do not want any osx partitions.  When I boot with the option key pressed and pick my windows 8 thumb drive to install... I see 3 existing partitions.  ol li200mb efi /li li465GB main partition/li li620mb osx recovery partition/li /ol  Since I do not need osx on this hardware... can I delete all of these partitions and create a new single partition for windows 8.1?
