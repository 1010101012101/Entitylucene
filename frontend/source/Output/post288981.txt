How to reverse port forward iDevice to PC over USB <body> I have a web server running on my (Linux Mint 18) PC listening on port 5000.  With an Android device I can access this web server over USB from the device by running:  precodeadb reverse tcp:5000 tcp:5000 /code/pre  After which I can browse to http://localhost:5000 on the Android device and see the web server on the PC.  Is there an equivalent for iDevices?  I have tried:  precodeiproxy 5000 5000 /code/pre  but the result is:  precodebind(): Address already in use /code/pre  Which is kind of expected as I can't see a way to tell iproxy to reverse the forward.
