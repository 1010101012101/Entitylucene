Are MacBooks Laptops, Notebooks or Netbooks <body> Are MacBooks (not just the retina MacBook) Laptops, Notebooks or Netbooks?  This is what I think.  ul liMacbook Pro - Laptop (High power and a lot of I/Os/li liMacBook Air - NoteBook (Medium power and a few I/Os/li liMacBook - Netbook (Low power and 1 I/O/li /ul  Am I right or wrong?br If I am wrong could someone explain to me why?  <answer176851> They're all just marketing terms.  Laptop - generic, applies to anything with a screen attached on a hingebr The most basic distinction from a non-portable Desktop, traditionally with a separate monitor &amp; keyboard.  Notebook - initially referred to HP laptops   Netbook - originally very low-end devices, powered by the Intel Atom, some running Windows, some on unix  The lines have blurred over the years - Wikipedia has an article on it, but I'd still say most of the distinctions are really artificial  The 'book' part is the only consistency - implying it can only be a 'book' if it's roughly a standard clamshell design, with a screen &amp; keyboard on the inside when closed.  <answer176873> Only two things I had to add here: The official Apple Style Guide has the following:      stronglaptop computer/strong       Avoid in favor of portable computer, which is preferred, or notebook   computer. See also strongportable computer, notebook computer, laptop/strong   strongcomputer/strong."   And anecdotally, even before PowerBooks transitioned to the notoriously hot-running MacBook Pro during the Intel transition, Genius Bar folklore I overheard implied that even though it was a portable, the computer was was not to be used on your lap, ergo any other naming besides 'laptop'...  <comment208934> Ok, So are all of the MacBooks Notebooks? Or is the 12" MacBook a Netbook due to the 1.1GHz Core-M processor? <comment208935> They's all just marketing terms - none of them are anything other than a portable personal computer. A MacBook is a MacBook, just as an HP Notebook is a notebook <comment208938> They are all Laptop (something you can use on your lap). The subdivisions are the NoteBook and the Netbook came later identifying specific designs and purpose of a Laptop. Netbook was a form of a laptop as inexpensive, light-weight, energy-efficient device, especially suited for wireless communication and Internet access. <comment208939> Just looked at the MacBook launch on the Apple event. Tim Cook was talking about the Notebook <comment208943> if Tim Cook was talking about notebooks, that's more proof than you'd need that the lines are so blurred even the manufacturer no longer is certain of the distinction <comment208944> Ive also heard other people calling MacBooks Notebooks. Is it really that blurred? Ive also seen people on the internet saying the 12" MacBook is a Netbook. Not saying your wrong. Just saying what i've seen and heard. <comment208946> No-one has made anything actually defined as a netbook since 2012 according to the Wikipedia article I posted [probably because they were barely powerful enough to load a webpage & so the term has been 'poisoned'. It's all just hype. <comment208947> Ok. Do you mean 2012 and not 1012. Didn't think we had laptop in those days let alone desktop computers! :P <comment208955> Why the down votes? <comment208999> I also heard people saying of not having them on your lap but to have a lap stand/table or use it on the desk (I pay no notice!). <comment209013> good question! who know why ! <comment209092> That would be a good question to ask on meta for a better explanation.
