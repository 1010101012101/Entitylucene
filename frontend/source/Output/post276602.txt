No option to enable Apple Pay on Watch <body> I have Apple Pay enabled on my iPhone (6S) and it used to be available on Apple Watch (original edition) too. I wiped and restored my watch, and now there is no Apply Pay available. The instructions say to use the Watch app and select "Wallet &amp; Apple Pay". For me the option is just called "Wallet" and the only option is to mirror the iPhone. Searching for "pay" doesn't help. I can make payments successfully with the phone. Both devices have latest OS releases (3.1.3 and 10.2.1 at the time of writing). Where has the option gone and how can I rectify this?  <answer276633> Please check the region your iPhone and your Apple Watch are set to. This is a quote from Apple.com, emphasis mine:     ol   liMake sure that you're in a supported region.      ul   liFor your iPhone or iPad, go to Settings  General  Language &amp; Region, then scroll to Region./li   liFor your strongApple Watch/strong, open the Watch app on your iPhone, go to the My strongWatch tab, tap General  Language &amp; Region/strong, and check the region   format./li   /ul/li   /ol   I had a similar issue in the past and was able to solve it after setting the correct region and restarting both devices.  Let me know if it worked for you as well.  <comment348199> try : unparing the watch (make a backup) and re pair it <comment348208> Wow, yes, unintuitive but indeed watch region was set to current location instead of region preference/card country. No restarts required: change region and go back to Wallet menu, start process of adding card to watch.
