What is the difference between "activate" and "launch"? <body> Here is an example of Applescript code:  precodedo shell script "osascript -e 'tell application \"Safari\" to activate'"  do shell script "osascript -e 'tell application \"Safari\" to launch'" /code/pre  Is there any difference in the behavior of these two commands?  Because, to my eyes, it appears that they accomplish exactly the same effect.  <answer271695> From the AppleScript Language Guide:     codeactivate/code Brings an application to the front, launching it if   necessary.      codelaunch/code Launches an application, if it is not already running, but   does not send it a run command.      If an application is already running, sending it a launch command has   no effect. That allows you to open an application without performing   its usual startup procedures, such as opening a new window or, in the   case of a script application, running its script. For example, you can   use the launch command when you donâ€™t want an application to open and   close visibly. This is less useful in AppleScript 2.0, which launches   applications as hidden by default (even with the run command).
