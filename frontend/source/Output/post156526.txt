OS X Mavericks - hybrid hibernate does not work? <body> I have MacBook Pro, late 2010. For a while I was using OS X 10.6 and sleep logic was next:br 1. after closing lid macbook go to sleep (with momentary wake up on lid open)br 2. after day or so of sleeping macbook changes it state to hiberante (ram2diskc I suppose). wake up should be performed with power button and it will take some time (like several minutes or so)  Recently I've upgraded my macbook with 8gb ram and ssd + OS X Mavericks. After closing lid macbook will go to sleep, but in my case it was "sleeping" for 3 days without hibernation (and about ~40% of battery was used). On ohter hand, Mavericks has option coderesume apps state after shutdown/code and it works almost nice except I would really prefer to have hibernate instead (e.g. I need state of my terminal with open programs/running commands inside it, some background services running, etc).  <answer194271> To see what the current sleep mode is (in Terminal):  precodepmset -g | grep hibernatemode /code/pre  To change the sleep mode to hibernate:  precodesudo pmset -a hibernatemode 25 /code/pre  To set back to the default:  precodesudo pmset -a hibernatemode 3 /code/pre  More info: tutsplus - how to hibernate a mac
