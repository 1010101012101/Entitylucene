Keyboard shortcut for Zoom style? <body> I have been trying to look for a keyboard shortcut that would let me toggle the Zoom style from the accessibility menu. I don't think there is one. Can somebody here point me in the direction of how to build one? I can code, but I'm unsure of where to start.   <answer225837> The zoom function on a Mac is usually codeCtrl + Scroll/code, and if this isn't enabled, you can go to Accessibility  Zoom  Use scroll gesture with modifier keys to zoom.  There's currently no keyboard shortcut for this functionality.  Hope that helps!  <answer225838> I've written an AppleScript script which toggles the Zoom style:  precodetell application "System Events" to tell process "System Preferences"     activate     tell application "System Preferences"         set the current pane to pane id "com.apple.preference.universalaccess"         reveal anchor "Seeing_Zoom" of pane id "com.apple.preference.universalaccess"     end tell     delay 0.5     tell pop up button "Zoom Style:" of window "Accessibility"         click         if value is equal to "Fullscreen" then             pick menu item "Picture-in-picture" of menu 1         else             pick menu item "Fullscreen" of menu 1         end if     end tell     tell application "System Preferences" to quit end tell /code/pre  You can use Keyboard Maestro or any other script launching app to run this script on a keyboard shortcut.  <comment274134> Just to clarify your question: you are asking for a shortcut to toggle between fullscreen and picture-in-picture zoom style? <comment274958> This is perfect! Thank you so much.
