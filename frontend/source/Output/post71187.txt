Mountain Lion freezes for 20 seconds after waking up from suspend to disk <body> Is there any way to get a progress bar or whatever when waking up from suspend to disk?  I remember seeing other Macbooks with older versions of OS X which showed a nice little progress bar after waking up. My Macbook doesn't and simply shows a completely unresponsive login screen for 20 seconds before working again.  PS: I don't want to disable suspend to disk completely, I have already increased the timeout when on battery to 4 hours and 24 hours when plugged in.
