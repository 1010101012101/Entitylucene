Calendar cannot be updated on iPhone 6sPlus <body> After iOS 9.3.5 update installed, I lost the ability to add events in my calendar. How can I restore this capability?   <answer250619> After iOS 9.3.5 update installed, I lost the ability to add events in my calendar. After following every suggestion I could find here on this site and online, nothing worked. So I just started turning features related to the calendar and iCloud on and off. One by one I checked to see if anything I did affected the calendar. Nothing did. So I kept going. And found my fix: Go into Settings then Mail, Contacts, Calendars. Scroll down to Contacts, open Default Account. Select iCloud. That's it. That was my necessary fix. Hope this helps someone else out there!  <answer250620> Go into Settings then Mail, Contacts, Calendars. Scroll down to Contacts, open Default Account. Select iCloud.
