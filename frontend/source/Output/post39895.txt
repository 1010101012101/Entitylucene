Edit phone number in phone app <body> Is there a way to edit a manually dialed phone number before re-dialling? Occasionally I have a typo in the number or forgot to add the country code prefix.   The only ways to handle this I know so far is   ul liwrite down the number and re-dial, or/li licopy the complete number, paste into a notes/text app, edit there, copy again and paste into the phone app. /li /ul  Not exactly user friendly.  <answer39909> I'm afraid you are correct in your assumption, once a number has been typed and a call initiated, it is not able to be edited within the phone app directly, and needs to be either sent to a new contact where you can then amend the number, or cut/paste elsewhere to allow you to make changes.  <answer208163> I found that using VoIP apps, you can edit a number after copy/pasting into the calling/dialing field, but you cannot do this with the native iPhone app.  <comment45142> Which is a shame IMHO. <comment45144> Quite true, I think the idea is that if you use a number more than once, you add a contact.  And if you only use it once then a little finger trouble isn't so bad.
