App Store doesn't show Mountain Lion Installed <body> I purchased Mountain Lion for my Mac Air, have had it installed for months, but the App Store continues to show I must buy it. I want to make a bootable drive but have no where to go for Mountain Lion unless I re-purchase. Help.  <comment88714> If you buyed Mountain Lion with the same account that the one you're connected on the Mac App Store. You will not pay again when re-downloading it.
