How can I set the screen refresh rate for a CRT VGA monitor in Leopard? <body> I need to operate a CRT monitor in 100 Hz (1280 x 1024) on a Leopard Machine. The same monitor was working fine on a Tiger machine in the mentioned range but I switched to Leopard and it does not show the 100 Hz option in the list any more (but I am sure the monitor can support it).  Is there a way to manually modify the list?  <answer13312> This handy utility SwitchResX can give you the option to adjust your monitor settings.  There is also this utility (which I haven't tried/tested)  <answer13413> So far it seems that there is no way to do this. I ended up changing my Graphics card to solve the problem.  <comment14120> thanks. But is there a system call or command line utility or some API to do this. I tried both the utilities you mentioned already and they don't work for me (I can't get to 100 Hz in 1280 x 1024 and I am sure my Monitor supports it).
