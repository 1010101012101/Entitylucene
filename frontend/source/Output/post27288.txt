mdns works different on snow leopard and lion <body> I have a few linux machines on my local network. Using avahi, they expose their name over mdns. This enables me to access them by doing codeping green.local/code or other commands (but by using the hostname).  To simplify using them, I added codelocal/code to the search path for my network settings. That is... emSystem Preferences  Network  Ethernet  Advanced  DNS  Search Domains/em.  When I was running snow leopard, this enabled me to do either: codeping green.local/code or codeping green/code.  However, now that I'm running lion, I get the following result:  precode[9:12pm][wlynch@orange ~] ping green ping: cannot resolve green: Unknown host  [9:12pm][wlynch@orange ~] ping green.local.

Once I've done that, it works for some amount of time (I've never figured out exactly how long, something less than a day).  As an aside, I've looked at my network traffic when I do hostname lookups of codegreen/code and codegreen.local/code. When I request codegreen/code, I do not see a mdns request. I do however see one when I do a lookup of codegreen.local/code.  Is there any way to revert to how snow leopard functioned in this regard?  <comment31304> Hmm - I've had that work reliably with several non mac servers - have you double checked the locations to be sure you're configuring the active one? <comment31305> @bmike: Sorry, I'm not following what you're asking. As I mentioned in the post. This setup worked with snow leopard, it's only with lion that I'm having problems. <comment31306> I know - is search .local showing in your /etc/resolv.conf - sometimes when I plug info into the preference pane, it's for another network location or the wrong adapter. <comment31307> @bmike: Yes. It is there.
