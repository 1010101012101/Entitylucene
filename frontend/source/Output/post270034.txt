Getting Around Alpha Bug for Preview in Sierra 10.12.2 <body> I'm running into the problem accurately described here:  https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4229655?start=0&amp;tstart=0  Summary: I take a JPG image, use a selection tool to remove the background so that it will be transparent, and then save the image as a PNG. The image background is represented as black, instead of transparent.  The link there shows that it's a "color profile" bug - is there a correct color profile that supports transparency?  <answer271202> It seems to depend on how the image was made in the first place, &amp; what its current background is set to.  Testing with the example given in comments I see the same behaviour as the OP when using Preview.br Even in Photoshop the same thing happens... unless I turn the image into an unlocked layer first. After that, erasing will then erase to transparent.  I've tested with other images made in photoshop with transparency, then saved as jpg. I also checked converting the jpg to png first, before testing.br It seems Preview is not the only app which will knock out to a predetermined colour, Photoshop will do the same, unless first converted to a separate layer. [In Photoshop you get the choice of which colour, but 'transparent' isn't an option.]  I'd say therefore, it's not a bug, it's intended behaviour; a limitation of a single-layered image.    I see no way round this except to use a dedicated graphics package, like Photoshop or Gimp.  <comment339294> Why don't you start with a png, as that already supports transparency? I feel we've only got half of the issue described here, or we have an [XY Problem](http://xyproblem.info) <comment339490> Oh should have mentioned - it's a piece of stock art I bought that's only jpg. <comment339601> Sorry, I can't repro, no matter what profile I use. If I knock the background out of a jpg, it automatically changes to png24 & then preserves transparency. Might be OS-dependant? <comment339719> Can you try using this image? http://www.123rf.com/search.php?word=woman+silhouette&imgtype=&Submit=+&t_word=&t_lang=en&orderby=0&sti=mf8koyinwwjuj71l89|&mediapopup=43253933 <comment339725> Yeah, that goes black. I'd try Photoshop or Gimp - something a bit more graphics-oriented. As soon as you switch it from being a background layer, photoshop will delete to transparent. <comment340232> btw, I don't think it's a "profile bug" I think it's that that specific file's current background is black. changing its layer structure in pshop then allows photoshop to create a new background of 'transparent'. imnsho, I'd say the original image is 'wrong'. <comment340443> I'm not an expert here, but when I select everything that's gray in the jpg, then delete it, why doesn't it fill it with "transparency"? <comment340457> ...because it fills with whatever is the current background layer, which appears to be black. Unless you can force it to become a separate layer of its own, that cannot be changed. Preview is the most basic of editors, it is simply not designed for such a task, you need a dedicated graphics package. <comment340495> Gotcha - can you bubble up and make it an answer and I'll give you the check?
