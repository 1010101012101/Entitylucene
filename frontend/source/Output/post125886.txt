Why does Messages on OSX always show unread messages? <body> On my iMac running Mountain Lion, Messages is chronically showing that I have 2 unread messages in its Dock icon.  However there are no unread messages at all.  I've even gone through and clicked on every single conversation in my history, just to make sure there wasn't some long-forgotten message floating around that hadn't been read.  It's not causing any major problems, but it is annoying to constantly think I've got a new message when i don't.  Anyone know why this happens?  <answer155201> I have been getting this on OS X 10.10 (Yosemite). I found a solution in the Apple discussion forums.  User LHindiii there recommended quitting Messages.app then using Activity Monitor to quit the Dock (which will automatically relaunch) and this worked for me.  <answer166692> I was able to solve this by right-clicking Messages in the Dock, clicking on the unread messages that showed up in the resulting contextual menu (they happened to be SMSes added via Continuity), and responding to them.  <answer174957> This worked for me:  I made a script in Script Editor that ran the following:  precodetell application "Messages" to quit     delay 1 tell application "Dock" to quit     delay 1 tell application "Messages" to launch /code/pre  Save the script as an application, and launch it every time Message messes up.  <answer197795> Easiest solution is to create a script similar to the one above with just one line like this:  precodetell application "Messages" to "clear unread messages" /code/pre  <answer233820> try restarting your computer, right click, and open the unread messages  <answer234654> I found that a combination of the previous answers works best as a script in Script Editor:  precodetell application "Messages" to "clear unread messages" delay 1 tell application "Messages" to quit delay 1 tell application "Dock" to quit delay 1 tell application "Messages" to launch /code/pre  <answer253041> Use Tinker Tool go to Dock menu and just relaunch dock  <comment147454> After observing this for some time, I noticed that it's not always 2 mesages... sometimes it's 1, sometimes it's none.  I have a feeling it's related to the messages being "unread" on other devices - like my phone or ipad - for a while.  Eventually the notification seems to disappear.  Unless anyone can shed any other light on this, I'm going to assume that's the case and close this question. <comment187243> This worked for me. An easier way (IMO) is just to use `killall Dock`, after you've quit the Messages app. Open it again, and you should be all set. <comment193048> Yosemite is really buggy compared to previous releases, in my experience. <comment195318> then it happens again for the next new Message. We can't do this every time, any other more permanent solution? <comment195520> Well of course, but that doesn't actually address the fundamental issue.  That's just what happens when you reply to any message.  But these are messages that have already been replied to from another device, so there is nothing to reply to.  They simply should not show as unread. <comment195557> As in your original question, Messages was showing unread conversations in the dock icon, but by sifting through all my conversations I was unable to find one that appeared unread. I did find, however, that unread messages *were* indicated in the contextual menu referenced in my post. If unread messages are going to appear in the dock icon and contextual menu, they also ought to appear in Messages itself. <comment198439> @MihneaSimian Not until apple fixes the bug. That said, it’s a pretty easy workaround. <comment206170> A nice pragmatic recovery script. Thanks! <comment227836> this didn't work for me at all :( <comment235876> Great script, thank you! <comment236528> That's pretty handy, thanks!  I just still wish I could get to the bottom of why it does this in the first place and make it stop. <comment242815> Thank you!  This fixed my problem permanently, whereas killing Messages and Dock only fixed it temporarily.  As a side note, I only had to click on the unread messages.  I didn't have to respond to them. <comment255983> Yeah! This did the job for me. Thanks. <comment278968> Certainly seems to be the simplest and most elegant workaround proposed. I will try it out next time I run across this problem (already had done the quit  killall dock  launch messages thing). <comment279666> Hmm. Just happened to me again today, this simple script unfortunately did not remove the phantom icon count. The three-action script did complete the cleanup however. <comment283409> This problem is still happening in OS X 10.11.4! <comment285783> Totally inapplicable here. <comment286530> `killall Dock` from the Terminal also works. <comment303118> did not work, unfortunately. <comment303119> did not work for me <comment303120> did not work for me <comment303121> did not work for me <comment303122> killAll Dock worked for me once, but the next time this problem happened none of the apple script solutions, killall solutions, and right-clicking the dock icon to select unread messages worked. only this reboot cleared the stale badge. <comment304421> It’s still happening in 10.11.5. This bug seems to be neglected by Apple. <comment314902> Welcome to Ask Different!  We're trying to find the best answers and those answers will provide info as to why they're the best.
