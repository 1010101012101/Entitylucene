How do I disable DVD player auto start when a DVD is inserted by using Terminal <body> If anyone can help me with this it would be the best! I have just installed 150 Mac minis in a hotel and I'm using remote desktop management to control them. Now I need to disable DVD player auto start when a DVD is inserted. I would like to know if it's possible to do this by using Terminal?  <answer55857> Couldn't you just copy the preference files? I don't know anything about managing multiple Macs, but there's probably some better way to do this.  Opening DVD Player can be disabled with codecom.apple.digihub com.apple.digihub.dvd.video.appeared -dict action 1/code.  codecom.apple.digihub com.apple.digihub.dvd.video.appeared -dict action 105/code will reenable it.  The preference for the desktop picture is in code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.desktop.plist/code, but I don't know how to change that directly.  You can find where the preferences are stored by diffing the output of codedefaults read/code before and after changing a preference.  <answer86318> I've never used ARD for this sort of thing, but can't you set system preferences en masse for a group of Macs? If so, the preference you're looking for is in the CDs &amp; DVDs preference pane.
