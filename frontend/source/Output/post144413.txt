Using Lightroom as external editor for iPhoto, how to save image back to iPhoto <body> I setup iPhoto to use Lightroom 5 as the external editor. Now when I open an image in iPhoto and click edit, it opens in Lightroom and asks me to import the image. Once I click import and make my edits, there is no option to save. I must export the image to some folder and drag/drop it back into iPhoto (which means I now have a duplicate).  Is there an easy way to make quick edits in Lightroom and just save over the original file so the original is updated automatically in iPhoto?  <answer165182> Unfortunately, I found several posts that explain why using LR as an external editor cannot be seamless (here's an example: http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1463251). This explanation makes sense to me for now. If I find something better I will update this reply.   I don't shoot RAW all the time, so when I do here's my workflow:  ol liCopy RAW files from card to desktop folder/li liImport (Add) to LR and edit/li liExport from LR to 'temp' desktop folder as JPEG files/li liImport JPEG files to iPhoto/li /ol  ** If I want to keep the original RAW files, I move the folder of originals, still on my desktop, to an external storage drive. If I don't need the originals, I can delete this folder.
