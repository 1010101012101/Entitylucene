stop iOS contact importing contact info from mail footers <body> I recently changed from using the gmail app to the native iOS mail app on my iphone.   Now when i search for a contact in the address book to make a phone call it seems to have pulled in a load of contact info from peoples email footers, i have some email accounts for work that i dont want to clutter up my contact book, is it possible to only set the 'search emails for contact info' setting to only apply to select email accounts ?   <answer259444> It's not available per-account, but the setting is adjusted in iOS 10 in Settings  Contacts. At the bottom of the list is a toggle for strongContacts Found in Apps/strong and that's what controls this pseudo-importing.  <answer259482> Maybe they are able to be separated by turning off certain groups of people from different accounts.
