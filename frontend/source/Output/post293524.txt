MAMP fails to update mysql <body> When I try to start my mysql and apache servers through MAMP on macOS, I get a message every time saying that mysql needs to be updated.  I try to update mysql through the MAMP interface, but it errors out with this:  precodeWarning: Using a password on the command line interface can be insecure. Looking for 'mysql' as: /Applications/MAMP/Library/bin/mysql Looking for 'mysqlcheck' as: /Applications/MAMP/Library/bin/mysqlcheck Error: Failed while fetching Server version! Could be due to unauthorized access. FATAL ERROR: Upgrade failed /code/pre  I found a very similar thread, that suggested trying /Applications/MAMP/Library/bin/mysql_upgrade --port=3306 -u root -p in the terminal. When I try that I get this error output:  precodeLooking for 'mysql' as: /Applications/MAMP/Library/bin/mysql Looking for 'mysqlcheck' as: /Applications/MAMP/Library/bin/mysqlcheck Running 'mysqlcheck' with connection arguments: '--port=3306' Warning: Using a password on the command line interface can be insecure.

If someone would not mind pointing out to me where it is, so that I can see if updating mysql after that works.  I will also add that I am using MAMP version 4.2 on macOS 10.12. If that helps any.
