Disable copy/paste for an OS X application <body> I would like to disable copy/paste for an app to protect sensitive information displayed in it.  I don't have the app source code.  I'm already aware of this general solution:     https://superuser.com/questions/608976/how-to-disable-copy-paste-on-osx   but I'm looking for a specific solution that only disables copy/paste for this application. Is it possible and how?  <comment124326> Are you asking from a developer or from a user perspective? Maybe you could also add some details about why you want to do this in the first place? <comment124364> @patrix, good questions. I updated my question. Thanks <comment124476> You could permanently gray out the EditCopy menu item by deleting its connection to the First Responder in the nib file. I *guess* you could programmatically disable Copy in the contextual menu that appears when right-clicking selected text. Another possibility, although I don't know if it is feasible with an acceptable amount of effort, is to send garbage to the pasteboard. <comment124520> @jaume I can not, I do not have the source code. <comment124522> The .nib files are in /Applications/NAME.app/Contents/Resources. Anyway, screenshots are still possible so I'm not sure whether disabling Copy/Paste gives you much security. <comment124523> @subzero Thanks for your comment, I got confused when I read you asked from an "IT/developer perspective". I took the liberty to rewrite your question, feel free to revert to your original question or edit it. Keep in mind that even if users can't copy/paste they can still make a screenshot, which defeats your efforts to prevent sensitive information from leaking. <comment124567> Thanks for editing it @jaume. Yeah, there is a screen shot canceler app already running in the systems. Anyway they could take a pic with their phones... <comment127280> then why display that information ? If something should not be copied, it should no be shown at all. <comment127341> @MatthieuRiegler it depends of the application, right?. As a developer, i'm just working on the requirement. Still, I see some uses. Like the credit card's call centers.
