iPhone 4s Wi-Fi hotspot app through Wi-Fi, not 3G <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   Can I use my iPhone as a hotspot on Wifi (instead of 3G)?       I have an iPhone 4s that I want to turn into a Wi-Fi hotspot. I don't want to use the 3G connection to do this. I want to use the Wi-Fi coming into the phone as the source. How can I do this without jailbreaking? Anyone know of an app. It can be free or paid.  <comment55534> I am pretty certain an iphone cannot work as a repeater.  You'd be better off connecting the wifi device direct to the AP the 4s is talking to. <comment55874> You have to have two network cards to become a repeater, and that's that. That's something that not even JailBreaking can fix. <comment58107> Hi @Paul, please rewrite your comment as an answer so I can mark it as the correct answer
