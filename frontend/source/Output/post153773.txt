How to rename formula installed via Homebrew? <body> I installed gcc with homebrew:  precode$ brew install gcc /code/pre  I can see the result:  precode$ brew list ant         gcc     go          libyaml     postgresql  tmux autoconf    gdb     isl         mpfr        python      valgrind automake    gdbm    libevent    openssl     readline    wget binutils    git     libmpc      ossp-uuid   ruby        xz cloog       gmp     libtool     pkg-config  sqlite /code/pre  I also see codegcc-4.9/code in code/usr/local/bin/code  precode$ ls /usr/local/bin ... gcc-4.9 ... /code/pre  The issue is that typing codegcc/code still refers to the system gcc  precode$ which gcc /usr/bin/gcc /code/pre  I wanted to rename codegcc-4.9/code to codegcc/code, but I don't want to break anything in homebrew. Specifically, I'd like to rename it in such a way that homebrew is aware of the change and running codebrew update/code will know to link the newly updated version to the name codegcc/code in code/usr/local/bin/code.  Can this be done?  DESIRED BEHAVIOR:  precode$ which gcc /usr/local/bin/gcc $ gcc -v ... version XXX $ brew update ... new gcc version YYY installed in /usr/local/bin/gcc $ which gcc /usr/local/bin/gcc $ gcc -v ... version YYY /code/pre  <answer154110> I don't think what you want can be done directly without hacking Homebrew formulas, er, I mean formulae.  What I do is put  precodeexport CC=gcc-4.9 /code/pre  in my shell profile.  That works in almost all scenarios I'm interested in.  An alternative is that you create your own "bin" directory, say code~/bin//code, put that first in the path, and symlink code~/bin/gcc/code to code/usr/local/bin/gcc-4.9/code.  Both of these methods will survive package upgrades.  <comment181009> You can rename `/usr/bin/gcc` to something else and create `gcc` symlink to `/usr/local/bin/gcc-4.9`. <comment181366> I usually just put an alias in my `.bash_profile` that refers to the one I want. Hackish way of doing it, but it works.
