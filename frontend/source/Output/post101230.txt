How can I increase brightness on Mac without Mac keyboard <body> I’m using a MacBook Pro and I broke it a while back. So, the keyboard doesn’t work on the laptop. I hooked up a keyboard to the USB port so I can still use it. I’m using a Dell keyboard.  Last night I wanted to listen to music without the brightness of the screen. So without thinking I turned the brightness off. Now I can't get the screen back so I was wondering if there's a way I can use the Dell keyboard to get the screen brightness back?  <answer101236> You could try resetting the NVRAM (ema.k.a./em PRAM). Shut down your Mac, then when you turn it back on, holding down kbdcommand/kbdkbdoption/kbdkbdP/kbdkbdR/kbd (kbdwindows/kbdkbdalt/kbdkbdP/kbdkbdR/kbd on a PC keyboard) until the computer restarts again.  The NVRAM typically stores hardware settings like brightness, volume, etc.  <answer101247> If you previously use GUI to control brightness, then pressing kbdF2/kbd or kbdFn/kbd+kbdF2/kbd should turn on the brightness back.  <answer101256> You can also use Apple Script - if you can ssh into your mac, you can then, in the ssh session, type the following:   precodeosascript -e 'tell application "System Events" key code 113 end tell' /code/pre  Please note, that you actually need to press Enter at the end of each line. Also, be careful with the quote characters - there's a single quote after the code-e/code option, and then a closing single quote at the end of line 3 above (following the codeend tell/code). Each execution of the script will increase the brightness by one notch. If you want it dimmer, change code113/code to code107/code.   If this is something you see yourself use more often, then it might be worth it to either define an alias or write a small shell script, eg:   precodeMacBook:~ alias brightup="osascript -e 'tell application \"System Events\" &gt; key code 113 &gt; end tell'" /code/pre  and:  precodeMacBook:~ alias brightdn="osascript -e 'tell application \"System Events\" &gt; key code 107 &gt; end tell'" /code/pre  Again, be careful with the quotes. When you put the above aliases into your code.bashrc/code, all you'll need to type is codebrightup/code or codebrightdn/code.   strongAdditional info/strong  If you can't ssh into your box, you can blindly type the first codeosascript/code command. I would do it in the following way:   ol lipress kbdCommand/kbdkbdSpace/kbd/li litype codeterminal/code and press kbdEnter/kbd/li liblindly and slowly (and carefully) type the first codeosascript.../code command from the example above, exactly as it is there. This should bump the brightness up a bit, enough so that you should see what you're doing. If not, try a couple of times to press kbdUp Arrow/kbdkbdEnter/kbd/li /ol  <answer129291> key: "strongscroll lock/strong" to decrease brightnessbr key: "strongpause/strong" to increase brightness  <answer143825> The "Scroll Lock" and "Page Break" are acting "F14" and "F15", respectively, for non-Apple keyboards. Make sure you turn-off / disconnected the bluetooth / hardware connection to the Apple Keyboard, then the Mac will recognize the non-Apple USB keyboard's "Scroll Lock" and "Page Break" as brightness shortcuts.  <answer187372> there is a very simple solution : just reboot  <answer214601> Use this free application from the apple store https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/brightness-menu-bar/id451140932?mt=12  <comment119204> What did you do to turn off the brightness? (or are you implying that the F1 key works on the device but not F2?) <comment119216> My experience is that this doesn't work in general; only with an Apple keyboard. When I plugged in a generic USB keyboard, F2 did not adjust brightness and there *was* no FN key to press in combination with F2. <comment187117> `BRIGHTNESS_DOWN 0x91` (decimal 145) `BRIGHTNESS_UP   0x90` (decimal 144) <comment198539> Oh wow I didn't expect this to work – but Macbook Air 2012 + Yosemite + KBT Pure Pro (TKL) works like a charm! <comment199328> Any idea how to get that to work *without* disabling bluetooth? <comment259178> A simple reboot won't do it. However, holding down **Command** + **Option** + **R** + **P** upon boot increases the screen brightness to the maximum. This boot is also used to reset NVRAM and brightness is one of them. <comment259184> Welcome to Ask Different.  Link only answers are insufficient as links can be changed or removed.  What is the App?  How does it solve the problem?  Please update your answer.  Cheers <comment261116> I've been looking for this for ages, thank you!!!!
