installed a new version of iTunes, 12.0.1.26 <body> I just installed a new version of iTunes, 12.0.1.26. When I want to add a new music album into my music  it is Displaying as individual songs in Music Library. Kindly Find the Image Attached.

There is a field in there called "Album Artist". Edit all the songs so that they have the same album artist and they will show up as one album.
