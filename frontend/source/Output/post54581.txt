How do I view comments in Microsoft Word 2011 for OSX? <body> How do I view comments in Microsoft Word 2011 for OSX?  I can turn on the review pane, but that shows me every edit I've done to this document and it's impossible to find the comments.  I just want a quick view of all the comments in the document.  <answer54592> Here's your solution.  From the Review tab, under Tracking, select the emShow Markup/em drop down and uncheck everything but comments.   img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/13717608/Screen%20Shot%202012-06-23%20at%204.17.15%20PM.png" alt=" Show Markup Dropdown "  <comment62533> Thank you, you're right.  For long documents it appears that it takes a few seconds for the review pane to upate after making changes in the drop down menu.  I tried your suggestion and when it didn't seem to do anything I changed it back right away.  Waiting a few more seconds allowed the review pane to update and show me what i was looking for <comment62536> It might not take as long if it was the default view for review.  Unfortunately, I can't test that since they didn't expose that feature under Preferences.
