How do you disable an application specific hotkey, for example, "Command-P"? <body> In many applications, Command-P is used to print.  My fingers are accustomed to emacs settings and reflexively press Command-P not for printing but for browsing history. It's annoying to see the print pop-up window every time when I press Command-P. I don't need a shortcut to print.br How do you block a shortcut globally?   <answer111798> This can be achieved by remapping the Print shortcut to a different shortcut that is out of the way, unused and unlikely to be pressed.  ol liOpen System Preferences → Keyboard → Shortcuts → App Shortcuts./li liClick strong+/strong to add a new shortcut./li liApplication: strongAll Applications/strong  Menu Title: strongPrint…/strong sub(that's a 'proper' ellipses by the way, use copy-paste if necessary)/sub  Keyboard Shortcut: Set it to something out of the way.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QxkGK.png" width="350"/li liClick Add./li /ol  Now, the Print command is set to a random keyboard shortcut, freeing up ⌘P.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6IZ3I.png" width="250"  <answer111848> You can also use defaults to change the shortcut to something like U+200B (ZERO WIDTH SPACE):  precodedefaults write -g NSUserKeyEquivalents -dict-add Print... '\U200b' /code/pre  codenil/code would be triggered when pressing n in some applications like Audacity and code\0/code would be triggered when pressing any key in Safari in 10.9.  I use a shell script like this to configure the shortcuts:  precodedefaults write -g NSUserKeyEquivalents '{ "Show Previous Tab"="~@\Uf702"; "Show Next Tab"="~@\Uf703"; "Minimize"="\U200b"; }' defaults write com.apple.Finder NSUserKeyEquivalents '{ "Show Package Contents"="@\r"; }' /code/pre  <comment131444> I'd call this more "system-wide" than "application-specific"... <comment131447> Thanks. That was a great tip. A note for dummies like me: it won't take effect until you relaunch the application.
