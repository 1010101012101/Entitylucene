How to stop iPhone from prompting to install iTunes to PC? <body> My employer uses iPhone for company phones. Every time I connect the iPhone to a PC to charge I get a prompt to install iTunes. I can't install iTunes at work (don't have the permissions) and don't want to install it at home. The incessant prompting is a nuisance.  How do I stop the iPhone from prompting me to install iTunes without installing iTunes?
