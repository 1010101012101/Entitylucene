Background audio interfering with notifications <body> I'm not sure if this just changed or if we just noticed it...  If I'm running an app that is playing audio in the background (red bar on the top of the screen) notifications that come in do not generate alert sounds emor vibrations/em. We observed this with a baby monitor app, but also confirmed it with the Ring video doorbell app.  This is a problem because we'll run the baby monitor app in the background a lot, and we miss notifications. The lack of even vibrations for alerts is particularly puzzling. Pretty sure I didn't always have his behavior. Observed on an iPhone 6 Plus and iPhone SE, both running 10.3.1. Does anyone know if this is configurable somewhere? Should I file a bug report?  <comment354329> I would file a bug report, yes!
