Setting keyboard shortcut to switch to an application <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   Can I create a shortcut to open a specific application on OS X?       For example, I'd like to use kbdâŒ˜ Command/kbd + kbd1/kbd to switch to my browser, with different numbers for the applications I switch between most regularly.  <answer53253> I would highly recommend installing QuickSilver which is an excellent application launcher:  ul lihttp://qsapp.com//li /ul  In QuickSilver you can also setup keyboard shortcuts for various actions (called Triggers)  including launching an application.  If you click here  ul lihttp://qsapp.com/about.php/li /ul  and then browse through the feature description until the eighth pane, you will learn about QuickSilver Triggers.  You could also have a quick look at the manual which is found here:  ul lihttp://mysite.verizon.net/hmelman/Quicksilver.pdf/li /ul  Triggers are described starting on page 34.  Hope this helps.
