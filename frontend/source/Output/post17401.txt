How can I release and renew my DHCP lease from Terminal? <body> From the Terminal, how can I release and renew my DHCP lease?  Currently, I'm doing the following for the wireless interface, but I'm wondering if there's a better way:  precodesudo ifconfig en1 down sudo ifconfig en1 up /code/pre  For the wired interface, replace codeen1/code with codeen0/code.  <answer17429> This can also be achieved with the following two commands :  precodesudo ipconfig set en0 BOOTP sudo ipconfig set en0 DHCP /code/pre  You can alias the two together in your bash profile:  precodealias renew="sudo ipconfig set en0 BOOTP &amp;&amp; sudo ipconfig set en0 DHCP" /code/pre  So then you just have one command called coderenew/code that will release and renew your DHCP.  <answer76606> The way the renew button works in System Preferences is to create a key in the system configuration. One can create the key via:  precodeecho "add State:/Network/Interface/en0/RefreshConfiguration temporary" | sudo scutil /code/pre  Swapping codeen0/code for the desired interface.  <comment19034> Rob's answer will certainly work - but `ipconfig set` always first de-configures the interface before setting up DHCP again. I've never needed the first command - and `ipconfig` is much more high level (it handles routes better) than `ifconfig` and I prefer it for the case you state. <comment88148> The cli command "ipconfig set en0 DHCP" is not a dhcp-renew in the pure sense but a complete discover,offer,request,ack procedure. The "renew" button on the control pane just generates a dhcp-request (preceded by a release) and is answered by an ACK. There is a difference between both as renew is typically sent by a cpe at half the lease time to renew to lease before it expires. Internet access-devices like a cable modem termination system will react differently on both procedure. So I'm still looking for a pure dhcp-renew command <comment88149> Are you waiting for someone to say, no - there is no better way or can we address your question / edit it so it's likely to get a different answer than ue `ipconfig`/`ifconfig`? <comment372055> @robzolkos Above command run perfectly fine for the Admin account but when I logged in as a standard user in MAC It prompts for password. If possible how I could skip this password part and a standard user can run this command.
