Does putting AppleScript code in a subroutine affect the speed of an Automator app? <body> I have created an application with Automator using only one "emRun AppleScript/em" action. But the AppleScript code is very lengthy and complex.  Does placing code into a subroutine, as opposed to simply typing out the code in full within the main "on run {input, parameters}" body of code, have any effect on the speed/response of the application?  Even if the answer is, "It's a negligible difference," I would still like to know, because, cumulatively, I'd imagine that it could make a significant difference.
