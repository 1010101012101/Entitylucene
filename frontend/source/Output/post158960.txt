Steam "not responding" on iMac 5k <body> I've just installed the Steam installer on my new iMac 5k, and downloaded the latest version of Steam onto it. When loading Steam, the login window loads, but all of a sudden the application freezes and needs to be "Force Quit". Any thoughts what a solution to this might be?  <answer159056> Try disabling firewall in Security &amp; Privacy settings, try adding rule to accept all internet traffic for desired application in Firewall Options.   When I start steam the first time of the day it crashes due error you describe, when I start steam 2nd time everything works just fine.  <answer159100> Ok, so I've managed to figure out a solution:  ol liUninstall Steam/li liTurn off the computer/li liTurn on under "Safe mode" (more info here: http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201262)/li liDownload and install Steam under Safe Mode/li liOnce installed launch, enter login details, and close Steam/li liRestart the computer as normal, and Steam should be working just fine/li /ol  Enjoy :)  <comment186997> What version of steam installer?
