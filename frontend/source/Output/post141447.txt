iWork 08 no longer updating in Mavericks <body> Apple talked a lot about updating iWork for free with the new Mavericks, I bought iWork '08 it was installed on my machine and updated with no issue.  A few months back I upgrade my MBP to a SSD, and did a clean install, I put iWork 08 on expecting it to be updated, but this hasn't happened.  Has this upgrade no longer available?  <answer141456> You can/haveto download Pages/Numbers/Keynote (now separate apps, no longer available as a set called iWork) from the App Store. Wether you have to pay for them or they're free isn't depending on your operating system but on the age of your mac.   <answer256918> iWork '08 was released for OS 10.4 originally from 2007. Whilst it would have free upgrades within its cycle e.g. 8.1, .2, .3 effectively this does not mean you get a free upgrade to a significantly new version 3 years later e.g. iWork 09.   In your case, its likely there was a temporary offer for a free upgrade initially to encourage customers to port to the Apple Store (for software download) rather than traditional disc installation. After a period Apple withdraw software these upgrades.  In terms of your re-install, have you signed in with the same Apple Store account used previously? If you haven't, it wont recognise your previous status and upgrades may be un-available. This is true of the 10.8 OS update - if it is on your Apple Store account as installed previously, you can download it again, if you come into the Store clean, you wont even see it as a download.   <comment166724> My point was that with the release of Mavericks the versions of Pages, Numbers, and Keynotes I had installed form iWork were all updated. Now I've done a rebuild, and reinstall they are no longer upgrading. <comment166818> What happens if you try to download them manually from the App Store?
