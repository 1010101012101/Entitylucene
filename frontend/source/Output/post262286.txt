Recovery partition: "Restore From Time Machine Backup" stuck at 43.6% for more than 60 minutes <body> I bit the bullet and tried to restore from Time Machine backup using the Restore From Time Machine Backup in the recovery console.  The Time Machine data is on a 2.5 inch USB 3 disk connected through a USB 3 hub to the 2013 Retina MacBook Pro 15 inch model.  In the past I've restored multiple machines using this technique and it never failed, but now it does:  After 46.3%, the restore stalls and Time Remaining keeps growing.  How can I get over this stuck point?  How can I view the restore log?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tmCX5.jpg" alt="Restoring stuck at 43.6% for a very long time"  Related to OS X 10.9.5 hangs with grey spinner; safe mode last message is &quot;payload 2: device was reinitialized&quot;
