Selecting files with one extensions that have the same name as files with a different extension <body> I have two folders of images. In one folder there are code.JPGs/code, e.g.     ul   li001.jpg/li   li002.jpg/li   li003.jpg/li   li004.jpg/li   li005.jpg/li   li006.jpg/li   li007.jpg/li   li008.jpg/li   /ul   in the other folder, there are code.NEF/codes. However some of the code.NEF/codes have been deleted, so there are e.g.     ul   li001.nef/li   li003.nef/li   li004.nef/li   li005.nef/li   li008.nef/li   /ul   The jpgs and nefs correspond to one another - they are the same photograph taken at the same time with the same efix data (saved to two seperate memory cards)  What I want to do is select the .JPGs that correspond to the remaining .NEFs. In the above example I want to select strongJPGs 1,3,4,5,8/strong but not the others. I actually have around 400 jpgs and 800 nefs.  I have tried using folder comparison apps such as VisualDiffer however they seem to only work if you're using the same full file name + extension.  Does anybody know how it might be possible to achieve this in finder or using terminal? or alternatively with a different app?  I am using Mac OSX 10.6.8  Thanks!  <answer93869> Open terminal and use cd to make the directory of *.nef files your current directory. Let's assume you have this structure:  mydir/jpegdir mydir/nefdir  So cd into mydir/nefdir  Then:  precodemkdir newdir for file in *.nef; do      root=${$file%.nef};      jpeg=${root}.jpg;      mv ../jpegdir/${jpeg} ./newdir/ done /code/pre  example below. Note here that I put "echo" in front of the mv command. You want to omit that, but I often use it when I'm checking that a script is doing what I expect before executing it. You also don't say what you want to do with the files, but moving them to a new folder allows you to select them, and you can always move them all back. I also shortened my tmp variable names.  precode$ ls -R total 0 drwxrwxr-x  4 tim  staff  136 Jun 13 08:02 . drwx------  9 tim  staff  306 Jun 13 08:02 .. drwxrwxr-x  8 tim  staff  272 Jun 13 08:03 jpegdir drwxrwxr-x  5 tim  staff  170 Jun 13 08:03 nefdir  ./jpegdir: total 0 drwxrwxr-x  8 tim  staff  272 Jun 13 08:03 . drwxrwxr-x  4 tim  staff  136 Jun 13 08:02 .. -rw-rw-r--  1 tim  staff    0 Jun 13 08:03 foo1.jpeg -rw-rw-r--  1 tim  staff    0 Jun 13 08:03 foo2.jpeg -rw-rw-r--  1 tim  staff    0 Jun 13 08:03 foo3.jpeg -rw-rw-r--  1 tim  staff    0 Jun 13 08:03 foo4.jpeg -rw-rw-r--  1 tim  staff    0 Jun 13 08:03 foo5.jpeg -rw-rw-r--  1 tim  staff    0 Jun 13 08:03 foo6.jpeg  ./nefdir: total 0 drwxrwxr-x  5 tim  staff  170 Jun 13 08:03 . drwxrwxr-x  4 tim  staff  136 Jun 13 08:02 .. -rw-rw-r--  1 tim  staff    0 Jun 13 08:03 foo2.nef -rw-rw-r--  1 tim  staff    0 Jun 13 08:03 foo3.nef -rw-rw-r--  1 tim  staff    0 Jun 13 08:03 foo5.nef  $ cd nefdir/ $ mkdir newdir/  $ for f in *.nef; do g=${f%.nef}; h=$g.jpeg; echo mv ../jpegdir/$h ./newdir; done mv ../jpegdir/foo2.jpeg ./newdir mv ../jpegdir/foo3.jpeg ./newdir mv ../jpegdir/foo5.jpeg ./newdir /code/pre  <comment110066> What do you want to do with the files once they are selected?
