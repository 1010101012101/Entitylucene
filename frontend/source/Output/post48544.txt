Safari on ipad, how to tell browser to ignore mobile stylesheet <body> How can I specify through the browser when to use the mobile stylesheet for a website, and when not to.  This is a specific issue for me on the ipad running Safari.  If this can't be done through the browswer, are any generic User-Agent spoofing tools for ipad that I can employ to accomplish this?  <answer48545> UserAgent Faker for jailbroken devices (in Cydia) changes the User Agent to ones of a desktop browser. Probably some third party browsers too, e.g. User Agent Browser (free ad supported or $.99 to remove the ads), but haven't used them.  <answer48547> Yes - get the Journey web browser and fake whatever user agent you prefer without needing to jailbreak your device.  It's a great second browser in it's own right, but the UA flexibility is worth far more than the cost of the app to me.  <comment55610> This did work very well.  But it's pretty annoying that I have to go to jailbreak tools for this sort of thing. <comment55611> Thanks, I'll give this a shot.  I would have thought that the safari browser would at least have a switch for specifying safari or safari mobile. <comment55612> I assume that Apple doesn't want people to mess up with Mobile Safari, that's why there is no UA changing progmam in the App store. Bot that doesn't prevent third-party browsers for non-jailbroken phones/ipads that support that. But if you have already jailbroken your ipad, it's just a small app to add. <comment55623> Desktop Safari has this sort of debug switch coded with a user interface, but not the mobile version.
