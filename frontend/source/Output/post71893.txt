Don't see “Bluetooth Radios” and bluetooth not working on Bootcamp Windows 7 <body> I attempted to ask this question at superuser.com but so far I have not received any help.  So for the past couple of days I've been trying to get my Logitech Dinovo Bluetooth Keyboard working on my Windows 7 partition. Unfortunately it is not finding any bluetooth devices. I have no issues whatsoever on the OSX partition so I know it's not a hardware issue. Additionally, it seems that I can find Bluetooth settings when I right-click on "Apple Internal Keyboard and Trackpad" but when I try to "Allow Bluetooth devices to find this computer" I receive this error. I also don't see the Bluetooth icon in the system tray.  This issue has been really frustrating so any help would be great!  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0m7Hv.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer71914> Perhaps there has gone something wrong with installing the Windows supporting Software. You can try re-installing this by using your installation discs, or you can download it on the software page on the Apple website.  <comment83534> Thanks for the reply! I already re-installed the Bootcamp 4.0 drivers and still doesn't see Bluetooth. This is extremely frustrating because I can't figure this out. Seems like there should be a simple explanation.
