How to successfully use time machine in MacBook Pro <body> I just heard about time machine, it can uninstall Xcode 7.0.1 for me and give me back Xcode 6.1. How do I do this? I've had this MacBook Pro since December 2012 and i've never used time machine before. I'm not a computer guy. How can I use time machine to go back maybe 1 week at most?  Can you give me a step-by-step procedure that will work successfully for a 1 week back in time?  <answer210736> Maybe these links are useful for you.  I have not used Time Machine before, but now need to back up to my external hard drive.  How do I do this?  strongTime Machine Q&amp;A/strong  <answer213965> The mechanics of Time Machine are pretty simple. I would recommend starting with restoring a folder with two files in it on your desktop to avoid the delays with restoring something like Xcode for your first attempt. Waiting for 5 GB or more to restore or even delete is a poor way to get feedback if you are trying to learn how to use the function.  ol liMake your test data and back up manually by adding Time Machine to your menu bar./li liAfter getting two backups with the folder (name it something searchable like code3821F8D0-E590-4AD5-95A3-7826E1484887/code or use codeuuidgen/code to make a unique-ish name. Spotlight will help you locate things in Finder as well as in Time Machine/li liDelete the original folder off your desktop. (this avoids getting a prompt to replace the folder/file - so once you're ready, you'd delete /Applications/Xcode and then go to your backup to restore it)/li liEnter Time Machine and search for the folder name in spotlight./li liLocate the time interval of your choice and select the folder/li liClick restore/li /ol  It will be restored to the original location and you won't be prompted unless there is an existing version of the file/folder. Keep in mind, when you restore a folder on OS X, the behavior is almost always to delete the old folder and strongeverything it contains/strong and then replace it with the copy.  <comment254348> You can't get anything back before the time of your first TM backup like any backup. TM is just an easy to use backup system. As you are not using ut yet you need to get back Xcode 6.1 from your current backups
