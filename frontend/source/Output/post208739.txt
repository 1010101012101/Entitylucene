How do I put the dock on the top (external) monitor in a dual monitor setup? (El Capitan) <body> I have a dual monitor setup with a MacBook Pro (Retina) 13" and 24" external Dell monitor (via DVI). I am using the MBP as the bottom monitor of the setup, and want to be able to use it primarily for full screen app tasks. This means I find it more convenient to put the dock on the top screen, displaying all the time. However, OS X only displays it on the very bottom screen.   I assume my goal ends up breaking Apple's mental model for how the dock (the dock attaching to a corner of the screen) works, which is why I haven't found a way to do this yet.   Any ideas on how to make this dream happen? I've attached a screenshot of the arrangement of the monitors (from the OS X Display system preferences).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Srtwx.png" alt="My current monitor arrangement"  <answer208750> Someone showed me one solution: there's a sort of "shelf" created where the bottom monitor is narrower than the top. If you move your mouse on the top monitor until it hits that shelf, the dock will pop up to the top monitor. However, if you move your mouse to the bottom of the bottom screen the dock will move back there.   This should be sufficient for my problem, but I'm leaving this up in case other people have alternative answers (and if this will be helpful for someone else).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/v4pgJ.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment251727> Is attaching the dock to the right or left side a option for you? <comment251729> I much prefer my dock to be on the bottom. It could work on the left or right, but I find it counterintuitive (just my personal preference).
