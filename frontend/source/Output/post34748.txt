How to transfer apps from iPad to MacBook Pro <body> I got a new MacBook Pro recently and I want to transfer my old apps into my new Mac, how can I do this?  <answer34751> ol listrongMenubar - Store - Sign In/strong (with same account used on the iPad)/li listrongMenubar - iTunes - Preferences - Store - Automatic Downloads/strong/li /ol  Once you have signed in with your account, a sync via USB should do the trick aswell, I think.  BTW: You might also need to authorize your computer to play some purchased music (Menubar - Store - Authorize this computer)
