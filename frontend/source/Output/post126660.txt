Alfred: How to get Alfred to run a terminal command? <body> I often need to run multiple copies of an app, like VLC. For this I use the terminal and run a command similar to:  codeopen -n /Applications/VLC.app/code  How can I create a shortcut with Alfred to run this one command if I type a keyword like codevlcnew/code?  <answer126662> I don't see a feature in Alfred that looks like it will enable that directly (though I might have missed it).  You can:  ol liopen Automator/li licreate a new application/li liadd the "Run Shell Script" action/li lipaste in your command/li liSelect "Save..." from the file menu/li liname it vlcnew.app/li /ol  Now Alfred should find that app if you type vlcnew.   <answer126691> If you have the PowerPack, you can create a workflow.  Workflows can run bash scripts in terminal, post notifications etc..  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UhaJJ.png" alt="Alfred workflow window"  <answer236381> Now you can also run a Terminal Command using Powerpack.  ol liCreate a "Blank Workflow"/li liOn the top right corner, click on the plus sign and choose the trigger you want./li liClick the same plus sign and now choose Actions - Terminal Command and type whatever command you would like to run/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GcvBI.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment148378> Solves my problem, thanks! <comment289279> Hi @Phil consider marking the answer as correct if it is ok. <comment325384> great answer. i've never used automator before. i would suggest a Step 7: move the new .app into your user's "Applications" folder.  in shell, this would be `mv path to my.app ~/Applications/my.app`.
