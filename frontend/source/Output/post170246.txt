Create a new iOS backup without deleting the previous one <body> When I go into iTunes and do a manual codeback up now/code it deletes the previous backup (as seen in codePreferences &gt; Devices &gt; Backups/code.  Is there a way to create a new backup without deleting/over-writing the old one?  <answer170255> You're close: codePreferences &gt; Devices/code  then Ctrl-click the backup name. Select codeArchive/code from the pop-up menu. The backup will be renamed something like "Device - Feb 2, 2015 20:03". The next backup will be a new one named "Device".
