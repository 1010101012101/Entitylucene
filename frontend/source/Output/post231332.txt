Have Siri tell me when something is ready <body> Is there a way to set a reminder or an event so when that event's time comes the iphone will say something like "your eventA is ready, keep in mind the traffic".  Where that phrase is something i can control?  <answer231341> As of right now SIRI can only be initiated by you. You can tell SIRI to remind you about something and you will get a notification about it but there is now way to have SIRI come on and say anything.
