iOS App Advertisement choice : iAd or AdMob ? <body> what will you choose , iAd or AdMob ? and what is the reason behind ?  I'm now using iAd, as I think Apple may block AdMob anytime, as Apple wants to protect its iAd. Is it true?  <answer94642> It is easy to combine both in the same iOS app. This URL will provide you more information about this issue.  Summary:  You try to load iAd, if that fails to load or something else happens - you can fall back on AdMob.  <comment110945> It's not clear what you're asking here.
