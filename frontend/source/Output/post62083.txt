Problem with web-sharing and resolving localhost <body> I was using codeweb-sharing/code and accessing some webpages that I had developed using codelocalhost/code. I messed up a PostGreSQL installation and deleted anything related to PostGreSQL and in the process appear to have damaged my apache installation.   If I run codeping localhost/code the result is      --- localhost ping statistics --- 794 packets transmitted, 794 packets received, 0.0% packet loss round-trip min/avg/max/stddev =   0.033/0.076/0.920/0.055 ms   I then tried running codeapachectl configtest/code and recieved the following output:  precodeLibrary not loaded: /usr/lib/libpq.5.dylib   Referenced from: /usr/sbin/httpd Reason: image not found /usr/sbin/apachectl: line 90: 16227 Trace/BPT trap: 5       $HTTPD -t /code/pre  I also tried  precodecurl http://localhost || echo $? curl: (7) couldn't connect to host 7 /code/pre  Within codeSystem Preferences-&gt;Sharing-&gt;Web Sharing/code when I try to tick codeweb-sharing/code I end up with it being unticked automatically. I'm fairly sure that my local webserver is not working, but I'm not sure what I can do to fix this problem.  <answer67281> Judging from your feedback in the comments, the installation of PostgreSQL brought its own version of codelibpq/code (which then got removed during un-install). To fix  precodecd /usr/lib sudo rm libpq.5.dylib sudo ln -s libpq.5.3.dylib libpq.5.dylib /code/pre  Then run codeapachectl configtest/code again to check for further errors.  <comment79118> I've also tried the instructions in this thread: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3243357?start=0&tstart=0 <comment79291> What does `ls -l /usr/lib/libpq.5.dylib` show? <comment79293> It shows `lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  41 Aug 22 09:14 /usr/lib/libpq.5.dylib - /Library/PostgreSQL/9.1/lib/libpq.5.dylib` <comment79294> Aha, broken symlink. Try `ls -l /usr/lib/libpq.*` next. <comment79296> `-rwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel   291680 Feb 20  2012 /usr/lib/libpq.5.3.dylib lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel       41 Aug 22 09:14 /usr/lib/libpq.5.dylib - /Library/PostgreSQL/9.1/lib/libpq.5.dylib -rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel  1602000 Sep  8  2011 /usr/lib/libpq.a lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel       15 Feb 20  2012 /usr/lib/libpq.dylib - libpq.5.3.dylib` <comment79302> Thanks for the suggestions. I ran the above code, and the output from `apachectl configtest` is the following: `httpd: Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name, using celenius.local for ServerName Syntax OK` <comment79330> Disable/enable Web Sharing again then and point your browser to http://localhost/
