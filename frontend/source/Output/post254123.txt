Migration from Outlook 2007 (win) to 2016 (on Mac) - a problem with calendars <body> I'm facing some difficulties regarding moving my mailboxes from Outlook 2007 (Windows) to Outlook 2016 (Mac). I've exported PST files and plugged them in via import option in Outlook 2016. However, my calendars are imported to separate folders, named after PST files. I want to merge them to my main Outlook calendar. I know that Outlook on Mac doesn't allow it explicitely (source). Does anyone figured a workaround how to achieve this?
