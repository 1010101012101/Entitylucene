Highest capacity HDD compatible with late 2011 MacBook Pro optibay <body> What is the highest capacity hard drive model that would fit and work reliably emin the optical bay/em of a 15" late 2011 MacBook Pro (MacBookPro8,2)?  As far as I can tell, the issues at play are physical dimensions and the well-documented SATA III compatibility issues with this generation of MacBooks.  I purchased a HN-M101MBB/ST1000LM024 but, contrary to its data sheet, the drive turned out to be SATA III (6 Gb/s) rather than SATA II (3 Gb/s), and did not work reliably.  Which brings me to the question: which 1TB+ HDD models can I expect to work?  <comment194951> Is there a question here since you already know the answer? 3Gb/sec is maxed out by EFI. <comment194952> @Buscarì›ƒ: The question is stated in the very first sentence: What is the highest capacity HDD **model** that would (i.e. is known to) work? A suitable answer would be "1TB Seagate model ABC" or "1.5TB HGST model XYZ" etc.
