WiFi self assigned ip, until network is forgotten and password is re-entered <body> I have a strange problem and I'm not sure if it's the router or the Macbook pro retina that has the issue. This issue is evident on two rMBPs, both running OS X El Capitan 10.11.6.   When I connect to the wifi network for the first time and enter the password, the connection is successful and works fine.  Subsequently reconnecting to the same network again, either by the laptop going to sleep, or turning the WiFi off and on, causes DHCP to fail. The only way to get it to work again, is to either connect to another network first, then go back to the one that failed, or to go to System Preferences  Network  Wifi  Advanced and remove the network from the list of network, then reconnect and re-enter the password again.  All other devices work fine on the network, including iPads, iPhones/Android phones, TVs, Rokus etc... and both macs with the issue work fine on other networks.  The problematic router is a ZTE ZXHN H298N. I've never had such a strange issue like this before. Any help appreciated, thanks in advance!  <comment321566> Try setting static IPs for the MBPrs (in the router's DHCP settings) and see if that helps <comment321797> @NoahL No luck by setting a static (sticky) ip in the router to the rMBP's mac address. Setting a manual IP address in system prefs also doesn't work. It says connected but it can't ping anything, not even the router. <comment321812> I'd guess you're looking at a router problem because all your other devices work with that router, and your MacBook pros work on other networks. If you've tried rebooting your router and resetting your router, I'd suggest looking for a new router or using a computer (instead of router) to assign all of your DHCP addresses
