How Do I Disable Remote Management and Enable Screen Sharing? <body> I am connected to a headless remote Mac Mini. Under Sharing in the System Preferences both strongRemote Login/strong and strongRemote Management/strong are checked though strongRemote Mangement/strong is "grayed out". I would like to disable strongRemote Management/strong and enable strongScreen Sharing/strong.  Currently the strongScreen Sharing/strong checkbox is "grayed out". When I click on it, I get the following message: "Screen Sharing is currently being controlled by the Remote Management service." This warning to not continue makes sense if I would lose my current VNC connection and not be able to turn it back on remotely.  To access the remote server I Connect to Server (command-k) vnc://IPnumber  I would like just strongRemote Login/strong and strongScreen Sharing/strong enabled and strongRemote Management/strong disabled.  Does anyone know the steps for me to accomplish this goal remotely?  <answer110790> I found the following code in a file I didn't open for a long time. It enables Remote Login on a remote device. Save the script somewhere (from now on referred to as code/path/to/script//code). Copy the script to the other device.  precodetell application "System Preferences" to set current pane to pane "com.apple.preferences.sharing" tell application "System Events" to tell process "System Preferences"     click checkbox 1 of row 6 of table 1 of scroll area 1 of group 1 of window "Sharing" end tell /code/pre  This enables remote login. Now, to disable remote management and enable screen sharing, use the same script, but remove the 3rd line and add these 2 lines:  precodetell application "System Preferences" to set current pane to pane "com.apple.preferences.sharing" tell application "System Events" to tell process "System Preferences"     click checkbox 1 of row 7 of table 1 of scroll area 1 of group 1 of window "Sharing"     click checkbox 1 of row 2 of table 1 of scroll area 1 of group 1 of window "Sharing" end tell /code/pre  To copy this script on the remote device, use codescp/code (secure copy). To use codescp/code typebr codescp /path/to/script username@IP.of.other.device:/some/path/codebr ORbr codescp username@hostnameOfDevice:/some/path//codebr The second option (using the device hostname) requires that the devices are on a computer-to-computer network, so it will not work on a normal wifi network. You will see a prompt requesting the password of codeusername/code. When you type the password, you will not see any text appear (obviously to prevent people from seeing the password).    Once it is copied, remotely log into the device:br codessh username@IP.of.other.device/codebr ORbr codessh username@hostnameOfDevice/codebr Again, the use of the hostname requires computer-to-computer network. Once logged in, run the script using codeosascript /some/path/theScript.scpt/code (remember that using codescp/code we copied the script to code/some/path/code, this will be different on your device). This will disable remote management and enable screen sharing.br Good luck!  <comment111734> You will lose your VNC connection immediately if you toggle off Remote Management. If only `systemsetup` allowed you to toggle these settings, this would be a one line ssh command. What version of OS is running on the remote Mac and do you perhaps have a Mac you can control that runs the same version of the OS?
