Macbook Air Caps Lock Delay in Windows 8 <body> I have remapped kbdCaps Lock/kbd to kbdBackspace/kbd in Windows 8 using SharpKeys on my Macbook Air, but there is a noticeable delay that prevents me from quickly pressing the key to backspace. The kbdDelete/kbd has no such delay.  I have installed the Boot Camp Windows Support software.
