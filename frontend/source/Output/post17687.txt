Re-install the App Store application on OS X 10.6.8 <body> I deleted the App Store application with AppCleaner some months ago, after ongoing problems with a freezing Finder. Now I would like to reinstall, but I cannot find a way. The 10.6.6 combo updater of course will not do the job because it needs an older OS X incarnation and I'm running 10.6.8.  <answer17692> This guy extracted the App http://www.qubesys.com/reinstall-mac-app-store/  <answer17699> If you don't want to trust an Internet version of the app, you can always reinstall from your Snow Leopard disc / restore media and run the combo updater of your choice. Any combo updater 10.6.6, 10.6.7 or 10.6.8 will have the App Store on it.  Also, your backup should have a copy of the app.  <answer22438> h2Download and re-install the Mac OS X 10.6.8 Update Combo v1.1./h2  at the link above.  <answer47563> The issue with downloading the app that someone has extracted is that it is coded with his Apple ID.  At this time I am unable to change the ID in the program to allow me to use it.  Better choice is to go with re-installing the update.  <comment19335> Have you tried the 10.6.8 combo updater? <comment19336> you could try to get the updater files and extract `App Store.app` <comment19350> Restore if from your normal backup? <comment54633> Stack Exchange is not formatted like a normal forum.
