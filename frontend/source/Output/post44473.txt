What app/feature/software is this microphone image from? <body> What is this microphone image from? It appeared on my friend's MacBook and she can't figure it out.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eZ1Jc.jpg" alt="screen capture of a round window with a microphone icon inside"  <answer44476> This is the Mac OS X built in voice input mechanism.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8UVOD.png" alt="enter image description here"  To turn it off, visit preferences - it's possible to turn it on via a keyboard shortcut which may explain it's random appearance.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MxmJj.jpg" alt="enter image description here"     strongSpeech Recognition/strong      Speakable Items, built into OS X and located in the Speech pane of   System Preferences, lets you control the computer using your voice   instead of the keyboard. And you donâ€™t have to train your Mac to use   it. You can use Speakable Items to navigate menus and enter keyboard   shortcuts; speak checkbox names, radio button names, list items, and   button names; and open, close, control, and switch among applications   This article from Lifehacker explains how to use the feature is you are interested in learning more.  <answer44477> If your friend navigates to the emSpeech/em pane of her emSystem Preferences/em she'll see that emSpeakable Items/em is enabled. Speakable Items is a limited form of voice recognition that allows you to issue commands to your Macintosh vocally. The microphone device you see indicates that the system is listening and, if I remember correctly, can also be used to toggle the listening state of the Mac.  <comment50554> You are so great. Thank you so much for your help on this. I was close with my investigation. Nothing was listed in the Force Quit, so from that I deduced that it was from some built-in feature. I then figured it would be in Universal Access, kinda the opposite of VoiceOver, but looked and looked and couldn't find anything with a microphone in Universal Access. I guess I should have looked further down on the System Preferences list to Speech, like you said. Thanks SO much! <comment50556> You are so very great. Thank you so much for your help on this.

I have never used the Chess app, so I had never seen the mic before. Man you guys are helpful here. Thanks!
