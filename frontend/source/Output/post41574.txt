Which internal Blu-ray drives are compatible with a unibody Macbook Pro? <body> h2Dimensions/h2  The (unoffical) dimensions which I found are:  ul li9.5mm slot load/li /ul  h2Software/h2  There is free Blu-ray player software available for the Mac and strongToast Titanium 11/strong is able to burn Blu-ray discs.  As it turns out, there are only few Blu-ray drives which are compatible (dimension-wise) with a unibody MacBook Pro and the lack of Apple support for this media makes driver support, associated software and other requirements makes reliable information on using a BlueRay drive with OS X and Macs hard to come by.  h2Question/h2  How can I know if a specific internal Blu-ray drives will work when installed in the unibody MacBook Pro? em(both specific models you know work with specific OS answers and answers to explain this in general would be of use)/em  <answer41628> A quick look at OWC doesn't show any internal BR drives for portable Macs, only in 5.25" format.  CDW only shows a single model internal BR drive, and I doubt it would work well in anything other than its intended laptop.  So I don't think a compatible product exists.  That said, I have a LaCie BR external drive that I occasionally use with my MBP 15" as well as other Macs around my office (including file servers).  It's not an internal, but its small, fast, and reliable.  <answer50213> Edit: Slimline drives are 12.7 mm thick; Super-slimline drives are 9.5 mm thick (these fit in current portable Macs smaller than 17")  Physically these two should fit for slimline dimensions (12.7 mm) - don't know about the software support (I guess it will be difficult to find someone who actually uses an internal Blu-ray drive in a portable Mac):  h1TEAK BD-C24SS-A slimline BD combo drive/h1  ul liSlot Load «Combo-drive», plays Blu-ray disks (no recoding for Blu-ray), writes DVDs &amp; CDs /li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZUBxN.jpg" width="256"   hr  h1Sony BD-5850H slimline BD burner/h1  ul liSlot Loading Mechanism, Max. 6x BD read, 6x BD write, Max. 8x DVD+/-R read/write, S-ATA interface/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/umoCE.jpg" alt="Sony BD-5850H slimline BD burner"  You would have to remove the plastic bezel/cover (which is normally not too difficult).  <answer50242> For the software, I have to say you won't be able to play a Blu-Ray drive onto your Mac since their is no decoder for Mac OS X integrated.br However, you can play your Blu-Ray movies by using Windows. And of course, some clever guys did find a work around to play Blu-Ray movies onto your Mac.   For the hardware, it seems it's pretty hard to find an internal drive with a 9.5mm hight to fit in your 15" MacBook Pro. Take a look at this picture with the supported models:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NHCVL.png" alt="enter image description here"  It seems like Apple, with his eagerness to design the thinnest notebooks, has made it almost impossible to install an internal Blu-Ray drive inside a Unibody MacBook Pro.  Their are some with 12,5mm in height, but they will only fit in a 17" MacBook Pro. And since you mentionned the height of 9.5mm, I assume it's a 15" MacBook Pro you're talking about.   So in my opinion, it's strongnot/strong possible to fit an internal Blu-Ray drive into a 15" MacBook Pro Unibody. It's like Steve Jobs said once, Blu-Ray is a bag of hurt (to implement it in a Mac).  I think you should look out for an external one. I would recommend one with maximum versatility, one with Firewire, USB, and eSATA connectivity.  <answer57134> Wonderful question! I am looking to do the same thing and found it difficult to find the right drive so that the wireless card will fit nicely over the top. So after a little searching, here is a  Panasonic  as well as the  Sony  drive perviously mentioned, these should both fit perfectly (with a little thinning down aka removal of the sony faceplate). So now we have the drive. If you are going to be installing this yourself there is a great walkthrough on drive replacement over at iFixit. Luckily apple got with the standard and any macbook 2009 or later will have a SATA hook-up which fits our replacement blu-ray drives. As far as software goes, the web is an endless source for compatible software. Although, VLC is a great media player that will handle blu-ray playback in keeping with a comfortable GUI.  <answer76814> I did not test it, but this one should be right. Is there anybody who can verify this?!?  http://www.amazon.com/Thinkpad-Ultrabay-9-5MM-Blu-ray-Burner/dp/B002L2K280/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1357338715&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=UJ267  Lenovo IBM 43N3230 ThinkPad UltraBay Enhanced Blu-ray  <answer79755> The following YouTube video by breakbeet808 confirms that     ... It is now possible with the strongPanasonic/Matshita UJ167 9.5mm slot-loading BD-ROM drive/strong, and/or the strongUJ-267 BD-Recorder drive/strong, and some extra software: Mac Blu Ray Player from MacGo.   However, these blu-ray drives are not a "100% direct swap out replacement":     There is a slight difference with some mounting points on the top side   of the drive. The problem is solved by swapping the drives' upper   casing out. br(see "How to upgrade to the Panasonic/Matshita UJ167 drive")   Once you finish the upgrade, OS X will "recognize blu-ray discs and it will be available to the file system like any other optical disc".  hr  h3How to upgrade to the Panasonic/Matshita UJ167 drive/h3  emThis may void your warranty.

It is specific, addressed to an obvious need and will allow several answers that are firmware compatible (or listing the limitations of some drives when used in an Unibody MacBook Pro) <comment47215> [This one](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Panasonic-UJ232A-9-5mm-Ultra-Slim-Blu-ray-Burner-Reader-/370477086804#ht_3834wt_1182) should fit in a MBP. <comment53668> @bmike This is one of those questions where I wish I could vote to reopen before it's closed (if it gets closed) just to get the ball rolling. <comment53669> I'm probably confused, but I'm at a loss to comprehend how a drive can possibly have dimensions of 5x5x0.5 inches **and** have any other dimension be 9.5 inches. :S <comment54691> @DanJ Thanks for the hint. This slot drive is 9.5mm in height. That's actually  0.37in and not 0.5in. <comment57513> That’s a tray loading drive. <comment57558> It seems like both slot drives are already 'naked' - i.e. there is no case that can be removed. But then the hardware buttons will prevent an installation in a MBP. <comment57577> Thanks for your answer. Unfortunately, OWC does not mention Unibody Macbook Pros. Also, they don't specifically mention internal *blu-ray* drives for the other mobile Macs. The prizes would have to be significantly higher. <comment57578> So, you are saying...? <comment57591> @gentmatt - worst case you can unclip the plastic cover and desolder the button. <comment57592> @iolsmit - they’re both too thick at 12.7mm unfortunately. <comment57593> OSX will read from and write to blu-ray data discs, and VLC has initial support for blu-ray video playback. <comment57601> @Robin - you're right. The 9.5 mm format is also called super-slimline. I wasn't aware of this new format. It seems there is no slot-load super-slimline BD drive available yet. [Some super-slimline tray-loaders](http://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?SearchText=9.5mm+slim+blu-ray&catId=7&manual=y) <comment57602> Slimline drives are 12.7 mm thick; Super-slimline drives are 9.5 mm thick (these fit in current portable Macs smaller than 17") - and you need a slot-load mechanism, no tray <comment109627> Great guide - but what are your thoughts on voltage/current rating - my concern is that the blu-ray may require a higher voltage/current rating that the original optical drive shipped with these machines. Could this overload the motherboard and cause instability or at worst irreversible damage - due to burn out of components? <comment109628> Great question - I'd like to do this myself - my concerns are if the blu-ray drive has higher voltage/current requirements than the original drive shipped with the machine - and would therefore damage the machine due to overloading of components (also wrote this point below the accepted answer) your thoughts welcome, as I'd really like to embark on this too with the piece of mind that my machine's life is not being shortened - after all such an upgrade is to keep the machine current and relevant. Thanks! <comment109781> All devices use the SATA interface which is a standard. The SATA standard also defines the voltage and current ratings for devices too.  The new device you're putting in should not impact your motherboard or cause any damage because the device will stay within the SATA voltage & current ratings. It cannot draw more current or a higher voltage because the motherboard will not supply it. At worst, the device will not work, and the main system will remain safe. <comment179805> Update: I fitted a Panasonic/Matshita UJ-267 to My mid-2010 17" MacBookPro. This is a brilliant guide: http://eshop.macsales.com/installvideos/macbookpro_17_unibody_mid10_optical_h/ (I did not buy from them or not do I work from them.) But beware of unthreading screws, particularly ones in the internal bracket, http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1464988 - I had this problem and I thought it was the end. But I follow the same solution and just cut the internal bracket with wirecutters so I could move it to unscrew another screw as required, the plastic is soft and doesn't shatter. <comment179807> The UJ-267 BD-R/BD-RE Blu-ray writer burner drive (it's also a CD/DVD burner) is recognised in both Mac OS 10.10 Yosemite and Windows 7 via BootCamp. Very happy, Despite having to break the bracket inside to be able to move it to get to a screw, as I had unthreaded one of the bracket screws (the metal seems to be very soft). But this is just the internal bracket (I could later glue it together), no damage to the MacBookPro's functionality or external appearance. <comment179810> With the spare original SuperDrive (DVD+RW) I removed, I have bought an external USB slot loading slim caddy/enclosure: http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00EXPJ94G/ref=pe_385721_37986871_TE_item
