Using Software Update Server <body> I'm using Mavericks Server to serve Apple Software Updates to my various Macs. Apparently, I have to point the client at the server, specifying my URL "e.g. http://su.domain_name.com:8088/index.sucatalog".  How do I find out this info for my setup? I haven't defined a URL for my server on the local network; 8088 is I gather the default port for the Software Update Server; but I don't know where or what the file is called either.  <answer107808> h3Summary:/h3  The simple way to configure a client to point to your Software Update server is using the following Terminal command on your client:  precodesudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.SoftwareUpdate CatalogURL http://su.domain_name.com:8088/index.sucatalog /code/pre  Replace codesu.domain_name.com/code with your server's fully qualified domain name as specified in Server.app. You can find your FQDM by going to strongServer.app/strong → strong[server name]/strong → strongAccess: Host Name/strong:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pJAER.png" title="FQDM in Server.app"  You can change your FQDM by clicking the strongEdit…/strong button on the right.  hr  h3More detail:/h3  ol liSet a host name by going to strongServer.app/strong → strong[server name]/strong → strongAccess: Host Name/strong → strongEdit…/strong. If you wish to access your server over the internet without VPN, choose Domain Name. Otherwise, choose one of the Local Network options.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CB29x.png" width="400" title="Accessing your Server"/li liSwitch on the Software Update service.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Np7N2.png" width="500"/li liOnce the service has started, you can find the FQDM in the Access section.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VJ1F5.png" width="300"/li liUsing this FQDM, you can find your CatalogURL by substituting this into the following URL:  precodehttp://[FQDM]:8088/index.sucatalog /code/pre  supFor example, if my FQDM is reported under the Access section as codeserver.example.private/code, my Software Update catalog would be located at codehttp://server.example.private:8088/index.sucatalog/code./sup/li liOn your clients, you can configure them by running the following Terminal command:  precodesudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.SoftwareUpdate CatalogURL [your-catalogURL] /code/pre  Replace code[your-catalogURL]/code with the URL that you got from step 4./li /ol  You can revert your settings by running the following Terminal command:  precodesudo defaults delete /Library/Preferences/com.apple.SoftwareUpdate CatalogURL /code/pre  Alternatively, you can use Profile Manger to provide OTA configuration using the Custom Settings section of your configuration profile.  <comment126433> So the domain for the URL is just my host name. And the rest of it is always "8088/index.sucatalog"...? <comment126434> @Ben Yes, unless you specifically change it or have awkward settings in your Web service or Profile Manager that is accidentally breaking it… :) <comment126481> BOOM! That's an awesome and comprehensive answer.
