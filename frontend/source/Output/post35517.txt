How do I have access to my Google Music contents offline? <body> How are you supposed to use Google Music on and iPhone? I uploaded a lot of my music to Google Music but I want to have offline access to them on my iPhone.  <answer35521> Offline access won't be possible until Google either releases an iOS music app or a Google Music API. Both are very unlikely.  Have a look at iTunes Match though.  <answer35522> Google do not provide offline access for google music on the iPhone.  However just searching "Google music" on the App Store, shows 2 (paid) applications, that seem to offer offline access.  <comment40457> Even an Android phone doesn't have *offline* access to music stored in Google Music, does it? <comment40460> You can have offline access on Android <comment40473> Just out of curiosity, how does it work? How does it know what it should and shouldn't cache locally for offline access?
