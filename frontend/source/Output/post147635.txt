Why isn't my new microphone working? <body> I just got an Antlion Modmic microphone, along with a Rockit headphone/mic to TRRS splitter. I've got everything set up, but my late 2011 mbp 15" just won't recognize the microphone as an input. I should have under my audio inputs box in system preferences a thing saying "external microphone," but I don't. I also don't think this is a hardware problem, either, it works fine on an iPhone.   Things I have tried:  -Plug the microphone in the Audio in Jack ----is not a powered mic input that my mic needs  -Tried plugging it in to the splitter first then in to the computer- still nothing  Is there something I'm missing?  <answer147848> From http://www.modmic.com/pages/faq:     For Macs you'll need a power source like an iMic to use the line-in, or an adapter like this to use the headset jack, or and adapter like this to use a USB port.   Unfortunately, I do not have the reputation to link what was referenced in the FAQ, you'll have to visit the FAQ yourself.  <comment174011> Where do you plug it in ? <comment174021> I plug the headphone and microphone into the Rockit adapter, which I then plug into the headphone jack on my computer. <comment174027> Did you try plugging the mic in to the jack next to it ? <comment174029> Your model has 2 jacks, one is audio out, the other is audio in. <comment174031> I know, I tried that, but that mic jack is not a powered mic input that my mic needs. <comment174032> Then, try plugging it in to the splitter first then in to the computer. I am still wondering if you have the right splitter? did you research that? <comment174036> I have done that, and it is the right splitter. It's actually the splitter recommended by the manufacturer! <comment174037> All the things you have already done but not telling us about the lead to pointless discussions. <comment174429> You see where it says "an adapter like this to use the headset jack"? That's the adapter I have. <comment190098> having this issue right now
