I want to remove some photos from iPhone 4s but keep them all in Photo Stream & iCloud <body> I want to remove some photos from iPhone but keep them in Photos &amp; iCloud. I want to keep my photoson my Mac Air, &amp; desktop. When I try to delete them off my phone it tells me it will be delated from Photostream &amp; iCloud.   I just want to decrease the number of photos on my iPhone. I connected to computer to upload some but it didn't ask me if I wanted to remove any from my phone.  <answer225959> It's not entirely clear, but I'll take a guess.  If you connect the phone to a computer and no photos are removed when you sync, the most likely setup is the iPhone is using iCloud Photo Library.  You would turn that off in the settings app - iCloud.  Then once the library is off - choose whether you want the phone to participate in Photo Stream / Photo Sharing or not.  At that point, once iCloud Photo Library is off - you can delete photos from the phone manually on the iOS itself or by connecting to iTunes / Image Capture app / Photos app on Mac / iPhoto on Mac and transferring / deleting photos en masse.  ul liHow to delete all photos in the camera roll in iOS 8.x?/li liUnderstanding Photo Stream/li /ul  <comment274495> Yes it worked.
