Can you resize a Keynote slide without resizing text? <body> I'm currently using Keynote to layout a web design, but I've made my slide too short. When I try to resize my slide, all the text increases in size, destroying my layout.  So my question is, strongis there a way to resize my slide without resizing the text?/strong  <answer72751> Keynote files are zipped XML files. I created some little Apple Script to resize keynote files.  Some caveats:  ul liIt always resizes all slides, no selection possible. Maybe you can export the slides you want to resize to another file and only resize this, afterwards merging it back./li liIt requires codexsltproc/code which is not included in Mac OS X by default. Choose between ul liInstall XCode (from Mac App Store, command line tools only are fine, too) emor/em/li liInstall codelibxslt/code, eg. using homebrew: codebrew install libxslt/code/li /ul/li liFollowing the comments, Apple changed the data format from Keynote '09 to the current version. Please save your document as a Keynote '09 document, as the script is not (yet) able to deal with the new format./li /ul  strongThough I don't believe the script could mess anything up, please do a backup before applying it!/strong  strongkeyresize now resides on github./strong  <answer189594> ol liSelect all the stuff on the page./li liCut it. /li liChange the doc size. /li liPaste it back. /li /ol  Text comes in just like it was.  <comment59484> How do you re-size your slides? <comment59514> @Michiel In Inspector  Document  Document  Slide Size  Custom slide size... Then increase the height. <comment112784> Thanks, saved me a bunch of copy/paste time!  Only problem with the script is you can't have spaces in the path to the Keynote file or itself. i.e. 'my keynote.key' won't work, but 'mykeynote.key' will. <comment115188> Thank you for reporting the issue, I fixed it and pushed everything to github. <comment151925> Thanks! This appears to work for Keynote '09 only, however I was able to convert my doc back and forth to get it to work. <comment151929> Thank you for the hint. I added it to the list of caveats.
