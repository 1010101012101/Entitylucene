How do I remove the recently added section in Music? <body> I recently updated my old iPhone 5 to iOS 9.  One of the things I don't like about the new music player is that when I start it up after I turned on my iPhone, half the screen is taken up by useless stuff, the main offender is the "recently added" section.  Is there a way I can get rid of this recently added section?  <answer234649> No, that section can't be removed.  Many people, including me, would like to be able to customize the start screen like this but I haven't been able to find any credible info on how to do this.  <answer296161> You can hide it is all I can find.... select "Recently Added" in the left column, then [Right]Click  [Uncheck/Tick] Recently added. Will not show when you open iTunes in future... Not perfect but a start   <comment374045> the question is not talking about itunes but the music app
