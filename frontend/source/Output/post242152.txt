how to make Mac use latest openssl instead of /System/Library/OpenSSL <body> I just (in June 2016) ran the following instructions to update Openssl (in /usr/local/openssl) on my Mac, but when I check the version, it's showing that I'm using a version built in 2015 (the System/Library/OpenSSL version).    Question: what can I do to get my Mac (running El Capitain) to use the latest version I installed?   strongThe commands I ran to use the latest version:/strong  precodecd /usr/local/src curl --remote-name https://www.openssl.org/source/openssl-1.0.2h.tar.gz Extract the archive and move into the folder.  tar -xzvf openssl-1.0.2h.tar.gz cd openssl-1.0.2h Compile and Install Configure, compile and install into /usr/local/openssl-1.0.2h.  ./configure darwin64-x86_64-cc --prefix=/usr/local/openssl-1.0.2h make depend make make install Create a symbolic link that points /usr/local/openssl to /usr/local/openssl-1.0.2h.  ln -s openssl-1.0.2h /usr/local/openssl /code/pre  When I run codeopenssl version/code in the terminal, it shows me this output (the important part is that it was built in July 2015 and is the System/Library/Openssl)  precodeopenssl version -a OpenSSL 0.9.8zg 14 July 2015 built on: Jul 31 2015 platform: darwin64-x86_64-llvm options:  bn(64,64) md2(int) rc4(ptr,char) des(idx,cisc,16,int) blowfish(idx)  compiler: -arch x86_64 -fmessage-length=0 -pipe -Wno-trigraphs -fpascal-strings -fasm-blocks -O3 -D_REENTRANT -DDSO_DLFCN -DHAVE_DLFCN_H -DL_ENDIAN -DMD32_REG_T=int -DOPENSSL_NO_IDEA -DOPENSSL_PIC -DOPENSSL_THREADS -DZLIB -mmacosx-version-min=10.6 OPENSSLDIR: "/System/Library/OpenSSL" /code/pre  <answer242256> Determine where the binary file codeopenssl/code is located.  precodefind /usr/local -name 'openssl*' -exec ls -lFd {} +  /code/pre  The binary file should have code/bin/openssl*/code at the end of the absolute path. Also open a Finder window to view the file system in the GUI with the command   precodeopen /usr/local /code/pre  Remove any symbolic links that you have created so far then make a new symbolic link to /usr/local/bin/openssl.  <comment297711> `/usr/local` is not in your PATH variable but `/usr/local/bin` should be. Try- `ln -s openssl-1.0.2h /usr/local/bin/openssl` <comment297712> are you referring to this? `ln -s openssl-1.0.2h /usr/local/openssl` , so I should try `ln -s openssl-1.0.2h /usr/local/bin/openssl`? <comment297716> I ran that. when I cd into `/usr/local/bin` and run `openssl` it gives me the old version `OpenSSL version OpenSSL 0.9.8zg 14 July 2015` ....even if the version in path was the old version, if I link the new version to /usr/local/bin, would you expect it to run the new or old version if I run `openssl` from /usr/local/bin? <comment297721> same result after running `hash -r` and opening new terminal window (and yes I'm using bash)
