Keep in mind that Mac OS X Lion Server is an additional package of server applications, services and tools on top of OS X Lion. You need it if you want any of the services provided by OS X Server.  If you intend to run the Minecraft server at all times, strongthe proper solution/strong is to start it as a deamon using launchd. strongSee here/strong.  This allows you to always get the Minecraft server running on system startup without having to open a user session. This way if your computer crashes and reboots you don't have to relaunch the server or login to automatically launch it.  <comment57454> Welcome to Ask Different! Can you add some detail to this answer? Where can the .jar and command be found? Are there any other installation or configuration steps? Please take a look at the [FAQs](http://apple.stackexchange.com/faq) for more info. Thanks. <comment104320> Command shown is missing a leading "java" and a trailing "minecraft_server.jar" <comment106301> @Olie - I fixed what you suggested. Next time, hit "Improve answer" and make the changes there (speeds up the process) <comment106302> Also, the missing "minecraft_server.jar" is normal. If you follow the instructions posted, it inserts the full file path.
