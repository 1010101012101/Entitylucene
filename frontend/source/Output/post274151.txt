Substitute for Karabiner's Multitouch Extension on macOS Sierra <body> I have been using the awesome Karabiner's 'Multitouch Extension'.  Once you rest a finger on the trackpad, keyboard keys are remapped to other functions. For example, the F key becomes a mouse left click, if you press it with your right-hand on the trackpad.  This feature, however, is not working for macOS Sierra yet and I would like to know if there is any decent substitute for it.  <comment344595> When asking for software recommendations, please review [this post](http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/a/2181/88313) for guidelines on how to structure your question.
