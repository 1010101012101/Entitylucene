Restore erased partition table <body> While trying to write an image to a SD card, I accidentally overwrote an external disk I use for Time Machine backups. I did a  precodesudo diskutil partitionDisk /dev/disk3 1 MBR "Free Space" "%noformat%" 100% /code/pre  which should have been code/dev/disk4/code insteadâ€¦ Now the backup disk is gone.  A codediskutil list/code just before gave  precode/dev/disk3 (external, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *3.0 TB     disk3    1:                        EFI                         209.7 MB   disk3s1    2:                  Apple_HFS Expansion 3TB           3.0 TB     disk3s2 /code/pre  The 209.7 MB EFI partition seems to be standard, so I assume the drive was formatted in a straightforward way.  Is there a way to restore just the (simple) partition information I have overwritten? I assume the partition data were not touched, right?  Before trying around I think I better ask someone who has the knowledge.  <comment320174> You'll need disk recovery software, but since you said it was a backup disk, I wouldn't try to recover it. Just start using the new partition with Time Machine, and whenever you do anything in diskutil, you should disconnect any drives you're not directly modifying. <comment320182> I have DiskWarrior and Data Rescue, but both need a valid partition table to start from. There were also some files other than Time Machine backups on the drive, so I'd prefer to "just" restore the partition table. Regarding disconnecting unused drives: for sure this is a lesson for me. In the future, I also won't copy+paste faster than I think.
