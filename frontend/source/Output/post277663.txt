macOS: Is there a way to keep the Emoji & Symbol viewer on top/without disappearing? <body> Since I'm not a MacBook Pro /w Touch Bar user, I occasionally use the macOS Emoji &amp; Symbols viewer to double-click various emoji entries into the system. However, the Emoji &amp; Symbols viewer is annoying because it's easily hidden by other application windows, and it seems to disappear once you click outside of the application window and select another app.  I can't find a way to make it "float" on the Desktop, or to prevent it from closing when switching to another app?  <answer277665> No, it opens on a per-app basis.    You can open it twice [or more], in different apps, &amp; it will remember position &amp; settings separately for each &amp; swap between as you switch apps.  It used to be global, a long time ago, but hasn't been for quite some time.  <comment349431> Thanks for clarifying! Perhaps I'll look around for a stand-alone emoji app. <comment349432> I don't know of one, but it might be worth adding in a comment or answer if you find one. <comment349436> @Winterflags Have a look at Ultra Character Map (not free unfortunately)  https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ultra-character-map/id520265986?mt=12
