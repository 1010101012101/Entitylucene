How to get exact NTP drift in OS X <body> I'm trying to get actual NTP drift on Macs connected to a local NTP server.  ul liWhen reading code/var/db/ntp.drift/code file I get -37.521 which according to PPM to milliseconds conversion gives strong-3241ms/strong of drift./li liWhen using codentpq -c lpeer/code I get something like this:/li /ul  pre      remote           refid      st t when poll reach   delay   offset  jitter ============================================================================== *172-1-1-5.light 164.67.62.212    2 u   57   64  377  199.438   38.322  29.012 /pre  which gives me offset of strong38.322ms/strong  ul liFinally, codesntp 172.1.1.5/code outpus this:/li /ul  pre 2016 Jan 21 18:41:45.248591 +0.019244 +/- 0.022507 secs /pre  which says having about strong19ms/strong of drift.  I'm confused which one the approaches gives accurate NTP drift?  <answer233568> sntp gives the current offset. The ntp.drift file is updated only occasionally, I think when the daemon starts.
