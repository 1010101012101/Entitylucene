Iphone4 Struck Not able to boot up <body> I have jailbreak iphone 4, just 3 days ago it fell down and switched off.  I tried to switch it on but it didnt started. When I connect it to charger I see apple logo for some time and after that blank screen and this process continues.  Without charger it is not even showing anything I tried to strat normally and even tried to hard boot , but no luck.  Can someone please help me out.  <comment256878> Try connecting it to itunes.
