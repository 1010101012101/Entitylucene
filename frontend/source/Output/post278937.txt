Is there a way to update the emoji font? <body> As you probably know,  and Unicode keeps adding new emojis, but, if like me, you can't or you don't want to update to the latest version of macOS, you don't have those emojis. I know that there are several emojis fonts such as  ul liEmojiOne/li liTwitter Emoji (Twemoji)/li /ul  But, I don't want to have this kind of library, I would like to have the "real" emojis from  (Yes, I ❤️ to use the Apple logo and emojis ).  Is there a way to update the emoji list from the  emojis?  This is my question, I think it's technically possible, but I have no idea where to find those emojis and how to update them.  <answer278948> You have to either obtain a copy of the newer Apple Color Emoji font from a newer OS version and install it in your machine, or manually edit the one you have using a font editor app which can handle this kind of font.  I think the second option is not very practical for most users in terms of the work and skills required.    <comment351082> Do you have any experience with replacing the emoji font? If it's anything like iOS, this won't work for the new emojis, requiring something like [EmojiAttributes](https://github.com/PoomSmart/EmojiAttributes) on iOS to be installed too. <comment351095> @grgarside No, I don't think I've even seen a report of someone doing it. <comment351142> Do you know a GitHub repo with the newer emojis? Because I don't want to install Sierra on my computer and then do a Time Machine Backup just for emojis
