How can you change the iCloud account name on iOS 10? <body> Is there any way to change the iCloud account name (not the actual email address, just the name of the account as in System Preferences/Internet Accounts on macOS) on iOS?  I know this had been possible in the past, but I can't find the setting anymore.  <answer281387> Settings → Apple ID → Name, Phone Numbers, Email → Name  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gflzM.png" width="160" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qhMHI.png" width="160" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hbZ9s.png" width="160" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2FVsm.png" width="160"  <comment354065> I found that one, but I'm asking for the account name that is shown within Mail.app. My accounts name is 'iCloud', and a customers is their full name, but they want to have it changed to 'Personal'.
