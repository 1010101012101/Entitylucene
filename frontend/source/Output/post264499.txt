My calendar looks like this  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jJSqM.png" alt="enter image description here"  It is very inconvenient, how knows how to disable these events or discard linkedIn from calendar?  <answer264613> The only way I found was to disable LinkedIn in your Contacts "Preferences  Accounts".  That is how I could prevent them from showing in my Calendar.  I highly recommend you to send feedback to Apple about this.
