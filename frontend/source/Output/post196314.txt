How do I pair the Apple Watch with another iPhone? <body> I have an Apple Watch and a second iPhone. Now I need to unpair the Apple Watch from the first iPhone, and pair it with another iPhone. I want to keep all of my data though. How would I go about that? How would I continue?  <answer220772> Go to Watch&lt; Apple Watch, then click Unpair Apple Watch. When you pair Apple Watch to the second device, all the data will be transferred.
