Why does the menubar hide when I'm in iTunes? <body> Often when I'm using iTunes 10.4, the menubar will hide and show like the dock does when you set it that way. I don't know of any settings that allow for that to happen on the menubar. Is it a bug or a setting that I accidentaly changed?  <answer32374> It sounds like you're running iTunes in full screen mode if you're on Lion. In the top right corner you should have a button with two arrows that allows you to switch between full screen mode and regular mode.  <answer32573> emIf this is due to a setting or false install, try this:/em  Use an advanced cleaning to strongfully remove/strong iTunes: strongAppCleaner/strong http://freemacsoft.net/#  Then strongreinstall/strong iTunes.

What version of iTunes? <comment37088> Nope, I'm on Snow Leopard. <comment37089> Snow Leopard, iTunes 10.4 <comment37092> Using any plugins? <comment46245> no, no plugins, etc. Another user has SuperTunes installed, but I have never used it. <comment68055> You're not using the full-screen modus by any chance, are you? <comment68924> Can you reproduce the behavior you describe in a different user account? Create a dummy user account and use iTunes from there. Does the problem persist? <comment68928> I recommend a much better way to do this: uncheck iTunes's app bundle. No need for a reinstall, and app bundle's don't store any computer specific data, so it'll be just like a fresh install <comment75886> @XAleXOwnZX That's great! I've been doing this sort of alternative re-install several times now and it has helped. Thanks :)
