How do I delete a voice memo from my itunes? <body> I did not check off the option to sync my voice memos, yet I still see my voice memos on my itunes. It does not give me an option to delete it from itunes. however I have already deleted it from my phone. How can I get rid of it?  <answer48682> Highlight all of the memos, and then press either the delete button on your keyboard or (as mentioned below) Command+Delete.  <answer86721> I had the same problem and I highlighted the voice memos and then hit the space bar. You have to hit where it says to put it in the trash. That's all I did and it worked.   <comment55784> Shouldn't that be Command + Delete? <comment162343> Make sure you're not in a playlist when doing this. <comment223669> @EmerickRogul so where should you be? <comment223670> Can you update your answer for the latest iTunes
