What's kern_spliot proccess that apears in my iPhone 4? <body> After jailbreaking iPhone 4, I was noticed that some proccess added to proccess list, like kern_sploit. What is this?  <answer10665> It's Greenpoison's exploit. It's legit. Snowbreeze installs it.  http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:rtd5ZX7kw68J:https://github.com/iH8sn0w/sn0wbreeze/blame/master/modIPSW.vb+sn0wbreeze+%22kern_sploit%22&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;source=www.google.com  Surprised there aren't more people curious about this. It shows how vulnerable the iPhone community is. They're naive.
