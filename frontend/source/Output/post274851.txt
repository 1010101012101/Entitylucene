Auto Acceptance email in an Office 365 Resource - Outlook for Mac <body> We have setup several resources in office 365 and it's set to automatically accept when booked out by a user, however when someone is booking out the meeting room, say user 1 books it out and it automatically accepts (set to auto accept when booking out) all Full access delegates are getting an email saying its accepted?  Surely this isn't right? Can this be disabled?  I haven't heard of this before and it only seems to be one Resource.  The Large Meeting room its called - We are having users who aren't even involved in the booking of the event (other than the fact they are a delegate of the resource) getting auto responses when the resource automatically accepts.  Any help would be hugely appreciated!  Thanks
