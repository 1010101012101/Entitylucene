How can I remove the "apple watch" app, which recently appeared on a home screen? <body> I don't mind that it showed up. But I want it gone.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/A7HCM.png" alt="Apple watch iOS app application icon"  I could put it into a folder called "things I don't use". But I'd rather just delete it.  If I ever buy a watch, I can just download the app.  <answer186584> You can't remove several of the Apple-supplied apps (try removing the ever-useful Stocks app, for example).  The Apple Watch app is one of these.  Generally, people tend to move these to a folder that they use to hide the 'useless' apps, or move them to a different screen - just so you're not staring at them all the time.  Where I live, the Apple Watch is not even available yet, but still I got the app staring at me to remind me of this constantly. It got hidden pretty quickly!  <comment220306> You can't: http://mashable.com/2015/03/09/apple-watch-app-mandatory/ <comment220314> I agree that it seems annoying to have these apps that we never use, that we can't get rid of. Spare a thought for the people who WANT an Apple Watch, but can't buy one because it's not available in their country - and yet they still get to see the app on their phone, and can't remove it
