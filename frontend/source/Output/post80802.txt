installing mac os 10.7 in vmware 9.0 <body> I am installing mac os 10.7 in vmware 9.0. I have to register user account many times: welcome screen - register information screen - create computer account screen, after press create button, it shows back wellcome screen, and so on ... How to bypass this step ?  <answer80803> First of all, I don't think it's legal since you're installing it on a non-Apple hardware. Unless you're running your copy of VMWare on BootCamp.  Anyway, the solution is quite simple, boot into Safe Mode with code-x/code kernel argument in your boot loader.  <comment93194> Could you maybe elaborate on how to achieve that solution? Maybe a step by step on how to pass an argument to the boot loader? <comment93195> Could you explain more detail ? <comment93197> @MauVuHuu What are you using to install OS X? <comment93200> @Shane Hsu I am installing osx in vwmare 9.0, host os is windows 7 <comment93201> @MauVuHuu I actually mean the disk image you use to install it. What's your install disk? <comment93204> I am using the 10.7 (lion) <comment93214> Give me the name of the disk image, clean image from Apple won't boot on a Windows-based machine such as VMWare virtualization environment unless it's VMWare Fusion. <comment93261> I downloaded the iso file from internet. It boots ok. But at creating computer account step, it asks me to register many time. <comment93264> Do you know what a boot loader is? <comment93279> @Shane Hsu No, I do not <comment334918> I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because it does not appear to be about Apple hardware or software within the scope defined in the [help centre](http://apple.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic).
