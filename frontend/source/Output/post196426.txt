How can I share Navionics with my iPhone <body> Hi I have Navionics on the iPad (love it) Can i share it onto my iPhone some how? Cheers Deano  <answer196429> Here is what Navionics says about that:     To turn on the Sync My Data function go to either Archive or Settings   in the app menu and turn on the Sync My Data option.      You will be required to create a Navionics Account (or sign into an   existing Navionics Account).  Signing into the same Navionics Account   on multiple devices will Sync your Favorites data through your Account   on our servers.   <comment234634> what do you mean by "share"?
