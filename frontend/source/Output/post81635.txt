Can I change the default music player app on my iPhone? If so, how? <body> I want to change the default music app on my iPhone from Music to Spotify. Is this possible?  My first guess is that I would have to jailbreak my phone. Is there anyway to do it without jailbreaking?   <answer81638> There is no way to do this on a non-jailbroken iPhone. And even after jailbreaking, there is currently no tweak which lets you do this.  <answer81646> I would say there isn't really any default music player on the iPhone. You could say that Apple's Music-app is the one that opens when you press "Play" on the lock-screen or the "multitasking bar", but there's no real advantage in that.  To answer your question, strongno/strong. You are pretty much unable to change any default things in the non-jailbroken version of iOS.  With that said, you can do some tweaks having jailbroken your device. If you would like to use Siri to play your Spotify music, there is a jailbreak app for that called AssistantLove.br Other than that, you could use the jailbreak app SpotiPlay. It makes the Spotify-application the one used on the multitasking bar.  <answer107009> I was looking in to the same thing, but sadly it isn't possible.  <answer221619> Ok so I found out how.   ol liGo to Spotify, don't play a song yet/li liPlug in your headphones then play a song/li liNow you lock your phone while the song is playing and now when you press the power button or the unlock button you should see the Spotify logo at the bottom left corner of the screen./li /ol  At least that's how I did it for Apple Music and then back to Spotify.  <answer294761> Sorry for bumping old thread. iPhone users can now download "MusicTube" for listening YouTube music on lockscreen.  <comment94137> How is Music the default app - in IOS you choose the app then it plays its data so you can have spotify working as well as Music? <comment134354> I think he means when he asks Siri to play his favorite songs, or play jazz music etc, it defaults to the Music app rather than Spotify. <comment279060> I did this and it seemed to work (for Play Music in my case).
