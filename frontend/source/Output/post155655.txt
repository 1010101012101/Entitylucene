Accidentally wrote over external hard drive with an img file using dd <body> I had two partitions, one "clear" and one encrypted.  Had my iPhoto library.  On the encrypted partition.  I am slightly panicking now.   Any ideas on how to recover my data?  Various relevant outputs;  precode$ diskutil list (snip) /dev/disk4    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk4    1:             Windows_FAT_32 boot                    58.7 MB    disk4s1    2:                      Linux                         3.2 GB     disk4s2  # diskutil cs list (nothing pertaining to disk4) /code/pre  <comment183127> We have a lot of threads covering how to a) recover from an inadvertent dd b) how to do file recovery of OS X partitions from Windows or OS X c) restore a backup. Could you add some details to make your situation different enough from the previous threads and we can certainly re-open this. Just use the edit control under the tags to clarify why the existing threads are not working for you. <comment183128> http://apple.stackexchange.com/search?q=dd+recover <comment183133> Thanks @bmike, will check other answers. <comment183135> Perfect - and if you have a `diskutil list` and `diskutil cs list` from the drive, that would be reason enough to open this as we'd have some things to explain that I don't see covered here yet. <comment183174> @bmike, I updated with the requested info, but it doesn't seem to hold any relevant data. I am going to boot an Ubuntu image now to try my hand at `gparted` as per another suggestion. Wish me luck! <comment183188> Well shit, Ubuntu bootable holds `gparted` but misses part of `gpart`, apparently. Which would be fine if it had network drivers for my MBP. Aaanyway, I'll let some commercial software scan overnight and hope it'll get at least my iPhoto libraries. I realized I have one on each partition, so if only one is salvageable I am both happy and sad.
