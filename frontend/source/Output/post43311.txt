An undefined volume appears out of nowhere? <body> Today, I noticed another mounted volume on my computer:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3k2Lp.png" alt="enter image description here"  This volume is the strongsize of my whole hard disk/strong. I can emonly/em see it in the iStat widget. I cannot see it in Finder or the Terminal.  precode$diskutil list /dev/disk0 #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER 0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *128.0 GB   disk0 1:                        EFI                         209.7 MB   disk0s1 2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            127.2 GB   disk0s2 3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3 /code/pre  The name seems as if it is an encrypted volume. However, I don't have anything encrypted on this Mac.  ul liWhere is this from?/li /ul  (I hope this is not a bug of iStat Pro which showed me this.)  <answer43313> codediskutil list/code will show you all the Lion core storage volumes and might be of use. The codedf/code command shows more network mounted volumes and will probably allow you to match that long string of characters to the storage structure used for MobileBackups in time machine.   premac:~ mike$ diskutil list /dev/disk0    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.1 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI                         209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:                  Apple_HFS mac                     499.2 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3 /dev/disk1    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:     Apple_partition_scheme                        *1.8 MB     disk1    1:        Apple_partition_map                         32.3 KB    disk1s1    2:                  Apple_HFS Google Chrome 17.0.9... 1.7 MB     disk1s2 mac:~ mike$ df Filesystem                        512-blocks      Used Available Capacity  Mounted on /dev/disk0s2                       975093952 837212344 137369608    86%    / devfs                                    366       366         0   100%    /dev map -hosts                                 0         0         0   100%    /net map auto_home                              0         0         0   100%    /home /dev/disk1s2                            3412      3412         0   100%    /private/tmp/UpdateEngine-mount.yzrVRXvfxf localhost:/J91gqbWGFXawS6VmjrAKYp  975093952 975093952         0   100%    /Volumes/MobileBackups /pre  <comment49208> This volume does not appear when using this command. :( <comment49210> Oh well. After a reboot, I've checked the volume again. It  changed it's name to [MobileBackups](http://d.pr/rWSs) like you assumed. :) <comment49211> Thanks! `df` does show this volume.
