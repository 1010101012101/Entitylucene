How can I fix getting permission errors when I try to copy from a mounted drive? <body> I'm attempting to install Open Office and when I drag the app over to the application folder. Both by dragging it onto the provided shortcut or if I drag it directly to the folder I get this error message:     The operation can't be completed because you don't have permission to access some of the items.   Later I also tried to install calibre an ebook manager and the same thing happened. I can't even copy from the mounted image into my home folder.  However if I go into the terminal (as the same user) and do:  precodecp -R /Volumes/calibre-0.9.10/calibre.app/ /Applications/ /code/pre  Things are working fine. What could be the issue?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vbmb7.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer75037> You may have to use a BatChmod or another permissions utility to temporarily set permissions in the Applications folder as read &amp; write by you - and when you are done, Repair Permissions to set them back. Short of futzing with the command-line, this is often the easiest way to get things done.  Don't discount the files within an application package, either, which can have different permissions entirely. Which is why, when changing permissions in the Get Info window, one must must remember to include enclosed files.  <answer75051> Once I rebooted my mac it seemed to have resolved itself. I'm uncertain what caused it.
