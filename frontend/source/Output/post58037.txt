How to use AppleScript to launch three scripts, each in new Terminal tab? <body> I'm trying to launch 3 tabs and run a script in each with AppleScript. So far I haven't been able to get this done.  Currently I have:  precodetell application "Terminal"     activate     do script "ping google.com"     tell application "System Events"         keystroke "t" using {command down}         do script "ping yahoo.com"     end tell     tell application "System Events"         keystroke "t" using {command down}         do script "ping msn.com"     end tell end tell /code/pre  This will launch three tabs but the pings don't execute in the last two tabs.  I'm probably missing something basic here.  <answer58151> ol li"strongSystem Events/strong" doesn't understand what you want to do with codedo script/code, use the codedo script/code command outside of the codetell application "System Events"/code block./li liYou must specify a window or tab when using the codedo script/code command, otherwise a new window will open./li /ol  Updated (sLion/sEl Capitan) :   precodetell application "Terminal"   activate   do script   do script "ping google.com" in tab 1 of front window   my makeTab()   do script "ping yahoo.com" in tab 2 of front window   my makeTab()   do script "ping msn.com" in tab 3 of front window end tell  on makeTab()   tell application "System Events" to keystroke "t" using {command down}   delay 0.2 end makeTab /code/pre   edit: it seems that El Capitan remembers the first command and automatically executed it when opening a new tab (using codecmd-t/code, which is what the script does), executing codedo script/code without a command opens the (new) terminal window for succeeding codedo/code's to use while preventing a command from executing automatically.  <comment66901> THANKS!  This works perfect in OSX 10.6.8, but in Lion it will try and ping google in all 3 windows?  Not sure whats going on there? <comment66908> Perhaps on Lion+, you must specify the tab and the window. I edited my answer.
