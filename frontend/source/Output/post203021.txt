Deleting of old backups in Time machine <body> I have WD-My book world of 1TB and I struggled for some time to set it up correctly to use it as a disk for usage of time machine on Mac OS X Yosemite.  My question is the following-what is the best way to delete old backups as I don't want to eat up all the HDD with the backups. I'm more than enough with a 1 month old backups.  I read on Apple's website about the deletion on files on disk but as this is a NAS disk it's a bit different than a regular USB external HDD and it shows me only a lookalike of the "img file" (when I go to get info, it says "Sparse Disk Image Bundle") see screenshot:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5uSwR.png" alt="enter image description here"  What is your advice?  <answer203024> The sparsebundle is a disk image file and probably contains your Time Machine files. If you double-click it, it should be mounted. If not, launch Disk Utility and open it from there (codeFile/code  codeOpen Disk Image.../code).   In order to delete backups, enter Time Machine, select a snapshot (time) and right-click in the Finder window. From there you can delete the snapshot by clicking codeDelete Backup/code. strongWatch out no more confirmation will be asked!/strong You can also delete all backups / snapshots of a file or folder by selecting codeDelete All Backups of .../code.  If you are more the Terminal kind of person you can also use codetmutil/code. This would look somewhat like this:  precodesudo tmutil delete /Volumes/Time_Machine_Disk/Backups.backupdb/computer/date/ /code/pre  You should only use these methods and strongnot/strong delete files manually from your mounted sparsebundle image.  <comment245042> just an addition, I'm asked for the confirmation when deleting the backup :) Thanks for the info and help
