Can I delete my iPhoto themes folder (/Library/Application Support/iPhoto/Themes)? <body> I have no interest in ever using them, although I do use iPhoto to store my photos. Will deleting the entire Themes folder mess anything up?  <answer63467> You won't be able to print, so bear that in mind.  <answer69971> I found if you leave all the folders starting with emPrinting.../em and the emAssets/em folder that are in the code/Library/Application Support/iPhoto/Themes/code folder, you can still print.    Just delete all the other folders and you will regain a chunk of disk space.
