How do I show who created/owns a file in the Finder? <body> I wish to see who created a file or who has ownership of a file within the list view of Finder.  Specifically I'm looking at a network Samba volume and can see the owner and group within Terminal.  emUPDATE/em: Using the finder to show the permissions is not enough as it does not tell me who the owner is. Notice below two users have the "Read &amp; Write" permission.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/atzVV.png" alt="Multiple read &amp; write for a file in finder"  Inspecting the file with terminal shows that the file is owned by 'rpopp'.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/y2i33.png" alt="File owner shown in terminal"  Also note that I wish to show this property in finders list view for all files at once.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cpAAu.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer49085> I appreciate this doesn't completely answer your question as its not a modification to Finder, but I've previously used Path Finder to do this - assuming you're willing to pay for and use a 3rd party application (though its does have a 30-day trial).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fG1yn.png" alt="enter image description here"   <comment56167> Try Command+I while highlighting a file.  Do you need more information than what is shown there? <comment56172> Yeah, the creator/owner does not appear in the info window, I also wish to see this as a column to see all files at once rather than a single file. <comment56181> binarybob, this could be the ticket for me, though it does sound overkill to buy a separate tool to just get the one field I'm after displaying. I'll have a think about it though and see. Are you aware if you can use the same tool on multiple computers? I've noticed it's not available in the app-store. <comment56182> @BrettRyan Looks like it according to... [Can I install one Path Finder license onto multiple Macs?](http://support.cocoatech.com/kb/purchase-registration/can-i-install-one-path-finder-license-onto-multiple-macs) <comment56184> Excellent, thanks binarybob, I haven't yet purchased this software though it looks the ticket so I will mark your answer as accepted. Thankyou for your help.
