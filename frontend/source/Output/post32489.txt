Stop Calendar from alerting me of reoccurring task? <body> I have a meeting every day at 10 am.  At some point I clicked a link to add a reoccurring task to my calendar. Now every single day 10 minutes prior, Mail opens and I see an alert about the meeting.  This is annoying for 2 reasons.  First, I always know the meeting is happening.  Second, I am not using Mail for my email client, which means it then tries to make me run through the New Account setup every day.  How can I remove this task from my Calendar?  All I can find is a way to Decline a specific day, but not delete the reoccurring task.  <answer32491> Deleting the task doesn't prompt you to delete all the other events?  hr  Can't you just remove the mail reminder? Set it from Email to None.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/S2YM5.png" alt="enter image description here"  iCal should then just prompt you if you want to update all the recurring tasks.  <comment37193> Which calendar client are you using? iCal?
