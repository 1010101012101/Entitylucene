DC++ software for Mac? <body> DC++ and Strong DC++ are powerful applications for the PC.  I would like to know if there is an appropriate software for Mac OS X (Lion preferably) which can connect to hubs in my network.   <answer40831> Direct Connect lists a couple of applications that support DirectConnect protocol. Amongst those are at least 3 native mac clients:  ul liMLDonkey/li liShakesPeer /li liJucy /li /ul  None of those, maybe with the exception of MLDonkey, seems to be very actively maintained though.  <answer60566> I use Eiskaltdc++. I used Shakespeer before but the developement stopped and there are some annoying bugs/missing features. The only problem is Eiskaltdc++ is not retina ready. Jucy has been buggy when I used it about a year ago.  http://code.google.com/p/eiskaltdc/  <comment60900> Wow. I remember DC++. I was really into that in like 2004. <comment69728> It would be interesting to know if DC++ runs well enough in VMWare (or other virtualization) solutions that map the PC and Mac home folders together or if people prefer a client compiled for OS X like [EiskaltDC](https://code.google.com/p/eiskaltdc/downloads/list?can=1&q=label%3AOpSys-OSX&colspec=Filename+Summary+Uploaded+ReleaseDate+Size+DownloadCount) with open sourced code at http://code.google.com/p/eiskaltdc/ <comment69730> Would be nice to have brief description of what DC++ and Strong DC++ does in the original question.
