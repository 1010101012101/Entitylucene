Two key combos for Enclosing Folder, but same result <body> While exploring the effect of different keys on menus in Finder in Lion, I spotted what seems like a redundancy in the case of the Go menu.  When pressing the ⌥ key while the menu is open, not only is the user Library added to the menu list, but the key combination for strongEnclosing Folder/strong changes from ⌘↑ to ⌥⌘↑. The additional modifier appears to be redundant, since the same enclosing folder opens with both key combinations.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MZM4y.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/G2JkU.png" alt="enter image description here"  At first I thought this was Lion-specific, so was surprised to notice that this also applies in Snow Leopard.  Can others confirm that they too experience this behaviour and, if so, explain why the two combinations exist?  <answer21369> In Lion and Snow Leopard, the option/alt key makes a subtle change:  ul likbd⌘/kbd+kbd▲/kbd reuses the existing finder window (preserving sort, view and size of the child folder)./li likbd⌥/kbd+kbd⌘/kbd+kbd▲/kbd opens a new finder window with the saved settings for that parent folder (closing the child folder)/li /ul  <comment23415> That's certainly subtle. What about in SL? <comment23416> A quick check on my SL machine shows the same behaviour. A discovery for me, so. <comment23417> Please edit my answer to make it better :-) <comment23447> This behavior has been existing since Classic Mac OS. <comment23454> MacLemon – Thanks for pointing that out. This is the first time I've been aware of it, despite many, many years as a Mac user (I guess I don't often feel a need to go to the enclosing folder).
