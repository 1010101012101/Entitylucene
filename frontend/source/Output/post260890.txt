You can then use the private key when logging from the command line - having to enter the passphrase for the key every time (if you have a passphrase on it).  If you want to enter the password only once per boot, then run "ssh-add" to add it to your local agent.  If you want a more GUI oriented application you can use a program such as "SSH Shell" that you'll find in the Mac App Store.
