What's the racoon doing in my apple? <body> I'm not normally one for paraniodly checking my activity monitor for rogue processes; but this one just has my internal nature-watcher all curious. Why is there a racoon running under my root user? What's it doing? Foraging? Looking for nuts and berries? Staring at headlights?   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aePww.png" alt="alt text"  <answer5997> From Apple's documentation:     strongracoon/strong speaks the IKE (ISAKMP/Oakley) key management protocol, to establish security associations with   other hosts.  The SPD (Security Policy Database) in the kernel usually triggers strongracoon/strong.  strongracoon/strong usually   sends all informational messages, warnings and error messages to syslogd(8) with the facility   LOG_DAEMON and the priority LOG_INFO.  Debugging messages are sent with the priority LOG_DEBUG.  You   should configure syslog.conf(5) appropriately to see these messages.   <comment6496> He said rack... Heh heh
