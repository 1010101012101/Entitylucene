Spotlight for Safari tabs <body> Is there a way to kbdcommand/kbdkbdspace/kbd (i.e. bring up Spotlight), type the name of an already open tab and bring it to the foreground?  Or an app that does it outside of spotlight?  I spend far too long looking for tabs, only to give up and make another the same.  I do have "Recent Tab List" http://nickvdp.com/tablist/ but I don't see a way to invoke it from the keyboard or integrate it with Spotlight, as what I'm wanting to do is access this from anywhere (not just when I'm in Safari).  I don't want to have to create an app for every website (Use spotlight (or Alfred) to open an existing chrome tab)  Safari &quot;Search Tabs&quot; Keyboard Shortcuts leads to http://hea-www.harvard.edu/~fine/OSX/safari-tabs.html which again isn't integrated into Spotlight.  <answer281867> You can search in Safari's open tabs: Two-finger pinch on the track pad, then start writing any word in the tab youâ€™re looking for.  <comment348496> Your second sentence says _Or an app that does it outside of spotlight_, so presumably Spotlight is not a compulsory requirement. However, you then go on to imply it must work in Spotlight. As part of my edit to your question I added _as what I'm wanting to do is access this from anywhere (not just when I'm in Safari)_, is that correct? Can you clarify? <comment352461> Use of spotlight is definitely preferred, as it is the OS X normal global keyboard combination to launch things. That said, if I can't invoke from Spotlight some other app launch-able by keyboard combination would suffice. <comment355936> Oh my goodness! I had no idea! Thanks a lot! <comment355938> Typical frustratingly minimalistic UI design that Apple omit the search dialog on that view until you start typing, although on balance the Edit - Find... is not greyed out.
