Trying to install Ant but getting -bash: brew: command not found <body> I have installed Homebrew using the code   precoderuby -e "$(curl -fsSL   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" /code/pre  it returns this inside the Terminal window  precode==&gt; This script will install: /usr/local/bin/brew /usr/local/Library/... /usr/local/share/man/man1/brew.1 ==&gt; The following directories will be made group writable: /usr/local/. /usr/local/bin /usr/local/include /usr/local/lib /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig /usr/local/share /usr/local/share/man ==&gt; The following directories will have their owner set to mitchellgant: /usr/local/. /usr/local/bin /usr/local/include /usr/local/lib /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig /usr/local/share /usr/local/share/man ==&gt; The following directories will have their group set to admin: /usr/local/. /usr/local/bin /usr/local/include /usr/local/lib /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig /usr/local/share /usr/local/share/man /code/pre  and then I tried all of the following   precodebrew doctor brew update brew install ant  /code/pre  Each yields back the line   precode-bash: brew: command not found /code/pre  In some other questions similar to mine, some people suggested changing the path but I'm not exactly sure how to do that. Running codeecho $PATH/code yields code/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin/code but I don't know how to change it or if it should be changed in the first place. Any assistance or guidance would be greatly appreciated.   <answer220223> If codebrew doctor/code doesn't run, then you have some breakage in the PATH variable on the system or you need to re-run the installer package, perhaps cleaning up things according to the support site for homebrew.  You can check where the brew command is with:  precodewhich brew type brew /code/pre  Both of those should point to a command located at: code/usr/local/bin/brew/code and the path code/usr/local/bin/code should be in your path variable. To test that, quit terminal and open a new window. The set command below should look like the one I pasted with "mac" and "me" different for you in all likelihood.  precodemac:~ me$ set | grep -i PATH PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin /code/pre  Since this is how the system should be set up out of the box, if you have made modifications you'll want to look over the site for ways to debug a broken path. Your text seems to indicate that the path is set correctly, but that's the cause of command not found or the brew script itself is somehow corrupted - but that script is in code/bin/sh/code not codebash/code so I would expect a different error if it's messed up in some manner.  <comment266548> What's your OS X version?
