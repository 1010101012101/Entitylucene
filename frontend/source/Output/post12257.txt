Scripting environment setup <body> When I start a session programming on my macbook pro, I have a bunch of apps I'd like open and ready:  ul liDevNull smtp java server (run from terminal with codejava -jar DevNull.jar/code)/li liTerminal shell in the tomcat/bin directory with codestartup.sh;tail -f ../logs/catalina.out/code running after coderm -rf/code work and test webapp directories/li liIntelliJ running/li liafter tomcat loads (fine with just having a timer), Firefox with my webapp loaded/li liafter tomcat loads, Chrome with my webapp loaded/li liForkLift/li liTextMate/li liCouple of Finder windows open in particular directories/li /ul  Those are pretty core...  then it depends on what exactly I'm working on as far as other apps I need open.  So how do I write a script I can double click on and have all the above ready for me, saving me a couple minutes each day and being a little less annoying getting started?  Is there a nice app that can easily do the above for me?  Do I need to write a bash or python script for this? Or learn applescript?  <answer12260> I'd use a bash script for this as everything that you list can be opened in bash.  Use the codeopen/code command pointing to the application to run the application or a folder location to open a particular folder with finder.  <answer12302> I use Concentrate to load up apps relevant to whatever I'm doing right now - you can run terminal commands, Applescripts, load programs, etc. I hit 'concentrate', make some tea, and then return to everything running. I know I could do this with Automator, but I'm too lazy to learn how.  <comment12793> sounds easy, what about loading firefox or chrome only after tomcat has fully loaded?  Is there an easy way to do this?  Could I run `tail -f` on catalina.out, pipe it to grep for the startup line and then load chrome and firefox somehow? <comment12794> I would just use the bash sleep command in the script to pause the script for a short period whilst tomcat loads.  A lot simpler.  See http://ss64.com/bash/sleep.html  I would load Chrome and Firefox last in the script, so the sleep time should be minimal.
