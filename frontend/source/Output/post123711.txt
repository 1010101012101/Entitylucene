Preventing iCloud from syncing internet accounts in OS X Mavericks <body> I have an email account that I wish to add to only one computer.  Unfortunately when I create the account, iCloud automatically syncs it with my other machines.  Any way to prevent it from doing that?  <answer123713> iCloud syncs Internet Accounts through the Keychain. You can disable Internet Accounts syncing by disabling the Keychain service in System Preferences â†’ iCloud.  <comment168886> This will disable all of keychain syncing, whereas the original question was related to just email accounts
