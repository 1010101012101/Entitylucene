Are the latest iPod Nanos running iOS? <body> The current version of the iPod Nano looks a lot like it is running the iOS. Is it actually running a scaled-down version of the software on the iPhones, or is it just a themed version of the classic iPod software?   <answer37396> According to this article, an Apple spokesman stated that the touch-screen iPod Nano does not run iOS.  <comment42405> Does not, and has not. Though the familiarity is quite remarkable for a completely different OS, no? <comment42457> That it is. I was trying to figure out if there was any chance of Apple ever letting developers port apps over to the device. Checking my email on a watch would be awesome. <comment42496> No it wouldn't. Reading song information is not bad. Reading an e-mail of any length is absurdly bad on a screen that small.
