iPhone 5c Dropbox upload delay <body> If I have the background refresh, location services, as well as the auto upload turned on in Dropbox, will it still only upload pics and vids when location is changed or the app is opened?  Is this only true if the phone is using cellular? If it is on WiFi, does it upload after each picture taken? I ask as I use my phone for both personal and business. Might take a personal picture and have a client show up that I need to show a graph to. Ideally, if on Wifi (which I always am) I would be able to snap the personal picture, wait 10 seconds, and delete if from my phone knowing it will be in the DropBox cloud later.  Looking for a ANY solution where I can snap pics and vids, wait a short (say 10 secs) and remove them from my phone but be able to view them later.  Tried photostream but when fully deleted from the phone, they are gone from the stream.
