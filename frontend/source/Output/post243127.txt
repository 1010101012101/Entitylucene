How to make the "Pictures" folder a folder again <body> h3Question:/h3  Is it possible to change a package directory into an ordinary directory, and how?  h3Context:/h3  I was copying an old iPhoto library to my "~/Pictures" folder from an external drive, but I somehow made a mistake as only the subdirectories of the iPhoto library were copied over.  I tried making a new ".photolibrary" directory and moving the subdirectories into that, but the system still thinks that my Pictures folder is a ".photolibrary" directory. It comes up as a "package" rather than as a folder now, meaning I can only access it throught the command line or by choosing "show package contents" in Finder.  Also, when I tried renaming the new photolibrary to be the same as the old one, I get an error message saying that there already exists a directory with that name, even though there doesn't. I'm guessing the Pictures folder/package somehow comes up as having the name of my old photolibrary after I copied it over.  h3Edit:/h3  I am using OSX version 10.9, so I don't think SIP applies.  precodels -dle@ ~/Pictures  drwxrwxrwx@ 131 User  staff  4454 19 Jun 01:37 /Users/User/Pictures com.apple.FinderInfo      32 com.apple.quarantine      21 0: group:everyone deny delete /code/pre  This is what comes up when I do "get info" on my Pictures folder:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/niwli.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer243142> emUsing answer space to provide pictures.../em  Get Info on both your Pictures &amp; Photos Library directories, make sure they are named as below, Pictures &amp; Photos Library.photoslibrarybr Also check whether the extension is hidden for only the Library &amp; whether something managed to rename it with a double extension .photoslibrary.photoslibrary - which has been known to happen.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/86SIo.png" alt="enter image description here"  The Pictures directory ought to be protected by SIP &amp; not allow you to change it. Post a comment below if the Pictures naming is wrong &amp; you need to change it.br Photos Library can be renamed at will [though Photos.app may lose it until you tell it where to look]    To look inside the package, you can just right click it &amp; Show Package Contents, however, the .photoslibrary structure can be toggled between a regular folder &amp; package by adding/removing the .photoslibrary extension then rebooting.  Post a comment if I missed anything &amp; I'll tweak my answer.  <answer243176> Here's an apple discussions page where another user has the same problem: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2586142?tstart=0  This problem is due to the fact that OS X has what's called a "bundle bit" that determines whether a folder is a bundle or not.   <answer243179> The code~/Pictures/code folder is showing two extended attributes it shouldn't have, codecom.apple.FinderInfo/code which is probably holding the embundle bit/em and codecom.apple.quarantine/code. In a Terminal use the following commands to remove both extended attributes that shouldn't be there.  precodexattr -d com.apple.FinderInfo ~/Pictures xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ~/Pictures /code/pre  No need to deal with Developer Tools at this point as removing the extended attributes with codexattr/code, which is already a part of OS X, will do the job.  Note that the reason I said "which is probably holding the embundle bit/em" because without seeing the output of codexattr -l ~/Pictures/code to compare, then under the circumstances I'm logically assuming that's the info being held.  In any case the code~/Pictures/code folder should not have any extended attributes set and, aside from the normally expected output, only the ACL of code0: group:everyone deny delete/code is appropriate output of codels -dle@ ~/Pictures/code I asked for.  <comment299330> This looks a good answer. :-) <comment299365> You said, "_The Pictures directory ought to be protected by SIP_" and while you answered before the OP edit showing OS X 10.9, which of course doesn't use SIP, nonetheless even in SIP enabled version of OS X SIP has nothing to do with the User's Picture Folder. See [About System Integrity Protection on your Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204899) to see what's covered by SIP.  That said, the Picture Folder does have an ACL applied: `0: group:everyone deny delete` <comment299371> I see two thing wrong with the Pictures Info sheet, one its shown as a package and Open with: Terminal, neither of which should even be there.  What's the output of the following command in Terminal: `ls -dle@ ~/Pictures` <comment299392> @user3439894 - sure - it was never really meant to be a fully-qualified answer, I just wanted to be able to see the difference between what ought to be & what actually was. Thanks for the heads-up on how the Pics folder is actually protected, by ACL, I wasn't aware of that - my nix knowledge is still a little rudimentary, but I'm learning... :)
