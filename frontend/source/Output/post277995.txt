New windows stuck in background <body> OS Version: OS X 10.11.6 (15G1212)  When I open new windows sometimes they become stuck in the background. I have noticed that this seems to happen with new windows being generated by an application (e.g. codeCmd + n/code on Firefox), the main window's control bar (the thing with the exit and minimize buttons) becomes grayed out, by using codeApp Expose/code I can see the other window but trying to select just brings me back to the original window, I can usually move the window to a new desktop and use it there (the times it doesn't work is when the application takes control of the mouse (like video games)).  Is this a bug in OS X or is it likely caused by another running program?  --EDIT--  I have discovered that this is caused when moving a window from one desktop to another, the moved window is permanently stuck on top until I close it or move it.
