How can I restore Spotlight to menu bar? <body> I removed the Spotlight icon from the menu bar. I would like to restore it.  I tried the recommended method:   precodesudo mdutil -a -i on sudo chmod 755 /System/Library/CoreServices/Search.bundle/Contents/MacOS/Search sudo killall SystemUIServer /code/pre  â€¦which did not help. The command keys still work, but I would like to see the icon. I read the suggestion to reinstall the system and would prefer not to do that.   Does anyone have a different suggestion?  Problem solved: The article from OSXDaily worked perfectly. Thanks to all who responded.   <answer201436> Just to make an official answer.  User M K referenced an article in osXDaily that explains how to both hide and un-hide the strongSpotlight/strong icon.     h3Show the Spotlight Menu Again/h3      Getting the Spotlight icon back is a matter of bringing the permissions back to their default setting in OS   X. Go back to the Terminal app by relaunching it from   /Applications/Utilities/, and then enter the exact command syntax   below: codesudo chmod 755   /System/Library/CoreServices/Search.bundle/Contents/MacOS/Search/code      Hit the return key, then follow this up with killing the   SystemUIServer process again: codekillall SystemUIServer/code The system menu   bar will refresh, and the Spotlight menu will be visible again.   I just tested this on strongOS X Yosemite 10.10.5/strong with success.  <comment123611> How did you remove it? <comment123612> Did you do a system restart after running the commands above? <comment123657> As mentioned in this article on osxdaily [see below], the user hid it by using `sudo chmod 600 /System/Library/CoreServices/Search.bundle/Contents/MacOS/Search` followed by `killall SystemUIServer`   Link to article:http://osxdaily.com/2011/12/12/hide-spotlight-menu-icon-mac-os-x/
