place text over image without imagemagick <body> I have a png image file which I would like to overlay text onto, via the command line (for use in a Makefile). The text to be overlaid is dynamic, decided at the time the image is modified.  I am aware that I can install ImageMagick to do this, but I would prefer to use a method that only requires standard OS X along with Xcode's developer tools.  Is there a command (or sequence of commands, including AppleScript if necessary) that I can use to make this happen? (If there is, an example would be excellent.)  <answer111059> I was trying to do what you requested using Applescript and Preview.app but Preview is not Applescriptable.  This is an ugly hack but it may suit your purpose, using Automator set up the following workflow:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vo9fU.png" alt="enter image description here"  If you save it as a workflow you can run it from the command line with the codeautomator/code command like this:  precodefor i in `ls {location of files to be processed}`;do `automator -i $i {location of .workflow}`;done /code/pre  <answer111179> You could try using a scripting language that comes installed with OS X, such as  PHP or Ruby, and write a command line script using that.  Here's an example using PHP:  precode&lt;?php  /* Usage php addtext.php input.png "The text" */  //  The source image (taken from the command line argument) $image = imagecreatefrompng($argv[1]);  //  The text (taken from the command line argument) $text = $argv[2];  //  Red colour $colour = imagecolorallocate($image, 255, 0, 0);  //  Change font as desired $font = '/Library/Fonts/Impact.ttf';  //  Add the text imagettftext($image, 20, 0, 20, 30, $colour, $font, $text);  //  Save the image imagepng($image, 'out-image.png');  //  Free up memory imagedestroy($image);  ?&gt; /code/pre  Save this script to a file called something like addtext.php and then run it like this…  precodephp addtext.php image.png "Some text to add" /code/pre  This example script should output an image called out-image.png with the text added, using the Impact True Type font that's installed with OS X, in the same directory as the PHP script.  You may want to read up on PHP's imagettftext function to play around with the text rendering.  Something similar could be done in Ruby, Python, etc. but I'm not sure of the "in-built" image manipulation / creation commands / libraries that come installed with OS X for those scripting languages.  Hope this is a good starting point.  <comment130930> Excellent… this is plenty to get me started. Thanks!
