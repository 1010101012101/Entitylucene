Does OS X keep a record of what iCloud account was used for OS reinstall "signing"? <body> A MacBook Air was stolen, wiped (OS reinstalled from recovery partition), and set up in the place of ANOTHER system that was stolen at another site (i.e. someone stole system A, took system B, wiped it and replaced system A with it hoping it would somehow cover their tracks).  It is my understanding that all recent OS X versions (Lion, in this case) require a network connection, and an Apple account login to "sign" OS installations. Does OS X keep a record of what iCloud account was used for OS reinstall "signing"? Specifically, in local system file logs. I've checked the contents of many files in /var/log including "install.log" which confirmed the OS reinstall date occurred right after the time of theft / just before the situation was discovered.  I'd like to determine which Apple account was used to authorize the install to help identify the responsible party.  Note: I'm aware of numerous methods for preventing situations like this, several of which will be implemented now that I'm involved.
