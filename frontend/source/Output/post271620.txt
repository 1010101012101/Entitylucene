How does the name of a Parallels VM translate to the default name in Terminal.app prompt? <body> I Parallels Desktop version 12 I have a virtual machine named codeCinquième/code. Note the accent on the codee/code. That VM is running macOS Sierra. In that VM, when I open the Terminal.app, the prompt shows:     cinquiÃ¨me:~ basilbourque$   Questions:  • Where exactly does bash in Terminal.app pick up the name of the VM?    • Obviously there is some kind of character encoding problem where codeCinquième/code is being mis-interpreted as cinquiÃ¨me. I would guess the original name is in UTF-8 and is being misinterpreted as ASCII. Any idea where along the chain of codeParallels/code  codemacOS/code  codeTerminal.app/code  codebash/code that misinterpretation might be happening?   <answer271645> indeed it may have to do with the accent, try it without the accent. my VM is called "PD XP MBP-Lex.pvm" in the mac and in Terminal and not changed. Do you have the standard language keyboard? If not maybe opening the keyboard from the menubar and select the US-International-PC keyboard and use the displayed keyboard layout to make the accent-grave.
