late 2014 MBPr 15" OSX 10.9.5 <body> While typing text in any application a beep from the system is heard indicating, I assume, some kind of event has occurred. At that point, it is no longer possible to enter text in the document. Focus has changed it seems as each key-press results in beep. Only by re-clicking in the document will focus return to it and typing text will once again work.  I have turned-off Notifications and it has made no difference.  Is there any way to see what event causes each beep?  <comment224975> The beep is that the frontmost app cannot use that key as a key-command. You need to look at the top left to see what app has come to the front when it happens. <comment225038> OK--the first beep is the same as the following beeps. That means something occurs prior to the beep to cause the current application to no longer be the active--accepting key strokes--application.Therefore I'm suddenly switched to an application that cannot take keystrokes and I suspect it is something from the OS that yanks focus away from an app. Is there a way to see what OS functions that are running or just were running? <comment225040> it's another GUI app coming to the front, or possibly a script alert - that's why I said to look top left to see what app is frontmost. Notifications etc don't interrupt the current app. <comment225470> "that's why I said to look top left to see what app is frontmost." Nothing appears in the upper-left. The app that was running is still running, but keystrokes are going someplace else that cause beeps. Only by clicking the original app does one get keystrokes to be sent to the application.
