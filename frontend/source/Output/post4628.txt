StarCraft II minimises itself after opening <body> Whenever I try to open up StarCraft II, the updating screen appears for a few seconds on 50%. The window then disappears, but it is still shown as open in the dock (light is on under the icon). How can I fix this problem?   <answer4808> I would add this as a comment but I don't have the privilege yet, but I would suggest also asking here.  <answer5569> Have you tried a full re-install of Starcraft? Have you ensured that you have all updates, particularly graphic driver updates, are installed?  Additionally, you can also find several troubleshooting steps at OSX Daily which includes a few close descriptions of the issue you described.  <comment4521> What Mac do you have? Which version of OS X? Open the Console application (in Application/Utilities) and see if something suspect gets written in the logs when this happens. <comment5964> Any luck so far on resolving the issue?
