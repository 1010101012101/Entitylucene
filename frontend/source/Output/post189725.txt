Set bash_profile to open with Sublime Text 2 by default <body> I'd like Sublime Text 2, not TextEdit, to be the default program to open my codebash_profile/code file when I call codeopen ~/.bash_profile/code in Terminal. Normally I would just control-click on the file in Finder to set the default program, but given that codebash_profile/code is hidden I'm not sure how to go about this.  <answer189732> You can do codeopen -a "Sublime Text 2" ~/.profile/code Assuming that name is what's on the app's bundle.  <answer189736> What about:  precodesubl .bash_profile /code/pre  instead of codeopen/code. You can launch Sublime Text with codesubl/code, and append a filename to open it.  <answer189746> You can temporarily show hidden files. In terminal write:  codedefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE/code  and then codekillall Finder/code to restart Finder.  Change what you need and then hide hidden files again by changing codeTRUE/code to codeFALSE/code.  Edit: Making this more explicit. In Finder, locate .bash_profile, open up the properties by right click + "Get Info". Then change the "Open with" to Sublime Text 2. This works, I just tried it.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Yt7mg.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer189996> I do this all the time, but i do it from the command line:  My bash profile has the st macro mapped to:   codealias st='/Applications/Sublime\ Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl'/code  And in the terminal i just type:  codest ~/.bash_profile/code  <answer263548> h1Sublime Text Shortcut Guide/h1  ol liOpen Mac Terminal/li liGo to homebrew.sh; copy and enter the following: code/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"/code/li liEnter codebrew install wget/code/li liEnter the following into your Mac Terminal: codeopen ~/.bash_profile/code but if for whatever reason you don't have one configured, enter codesudo nano .bash_profile/code.  strongPlease be advised, this solution presumes you are the root user of your system/device./strong/li liOpen another tab within the terminal-window and check Ruby version (e.g. coderuby -v/code); if absent, become sufficiently by Rubified by entering: codebrew install ruby/code/li liDownload Sublime Text 3, then go to root/usr (e.g. codecd alexanderjsingleton//code)./li liNext after you've installed Sublime 3, codeopen /Applications/Sublime\ Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl/code/li liCreate a symlink called emsublime/em by entering codeln -s "/Applications/Sublime Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl" /usr/local/bin/sublime/code/li liEnter the following into your Mac Terminal: codeopen ~/.bash_profile/code but if for whatever reason you don't have one configured, enter codesudo nano .bash_profile/code./li liExit and open your bash profile; the following example should be contained in the profile codeexport PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH/code.

A special thanks to the great Ashley Nolan's blog, though for whatever reason my new MacBookPro couldn't access the bash-profile, so I had to create one, which is why I included that caveat in step 4.  I trust this will assuage any systemAdmin anguish fellow developers may take for granted. :D/li /ol  <comment225087> Have you tried unhiding it? Also, though I'm not sure if this would work, you could create your own foobar.bash_profile file and set the default program like you stated above. <comment225115> @Mark I think you misunderstood. I updated the instructions. This method sets the default so that it does not open in TextEdit. <comment225132> this doesn't answer the OP <comment225133> this is the correct answer.
