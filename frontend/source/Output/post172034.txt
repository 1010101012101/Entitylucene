Which format to use in Garageband? <body> I would like to record my voice, a guitar and an electronic drummer through a mixer into Garageband.  When I click on 'New Project' I am not sure what format (piano, voice, etc.) I should be using. Can you steer me in the right direction?  <answer172055> I always start with SongWriter, it sounds like it would suit your needs perfectly. It includes tracks already set up for vocals, drums, keyboards and guitar.  <comment202677> Thanks for the help.  I'll give it a try.
