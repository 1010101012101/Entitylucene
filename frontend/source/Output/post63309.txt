How to increase the middleclick area of the Magic Mouse? <body> I am using BetterTouchTool to set the gesture "Single middle click" to "Middleclick". I have problems hitting the small middleclick-area of the mouse at once :-/   So is there a way to increase the middleclick-area?  (Alternatively I use a two finger tap as middleclick, but I'd prefer the real thing :-))  <answer63710> Unless you're completely devoted to Better Touch Tool, another option (and one that I've been using myself for the past couple of years) is MagicPrefs. It gives you the same functionality as Better Touch Tool, as well as allowing you to set the area on the mouse that responds to the touch gestures.  <comment114865> This maybe achieveable with a different App such as http://www.jitouch.com/ <comment125700> You could also try three finger click as the middle click. It works very well for me.
