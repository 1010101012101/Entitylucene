YouTube activates fullscreen, does OS X fullscreen animation <body> A few months ago, when I would fullscreen YouTube, it would be instant. Now I get the super long fullscreen animation and it sends my full-screened YouTube video into another Desktop/Space.  How can I get Youtube to fullscreen normally like in Windows or Ubunutu, OR like what I had on my Mac a few months ago?  <comment280774> Possible duplicate: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/128717/how-to-disable-full-screen-animation-on-os-x-10-9 <comment280784> And your question is what exactly?
