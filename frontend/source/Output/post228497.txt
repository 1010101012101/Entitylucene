Is there any way to enable El Captain Spotlight features in unsupported countries? <body> I know that Spotlight Suggestions and Natural Language Search are only available in a few countries.   How does OS X decides if I am in these countries or not? I switched to US locale and region in System Preferences and I use US VPN, so I have US IP Address. But Spotlight features are still disabled.   Is there any way to convince OS X to use these new features?
