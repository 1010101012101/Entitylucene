opendirectoryd thinks it is offline <body> I have a macOS Sierra (10.12.3) machine hooked up to an AD domain aka "Network Account Server" but I am unable to change my password and I get the error below when I attempt to do so:     The server is not available. Change your password when the server becomes available.   However in "Users &amp; Groups" preferences pane the "Network Account Server" indicator is green. I opened up the "Directory Utility", opened up the domain under "Services", expanded the details, clicked on the "Administrative" tab and told it to use a specific domain server via "Prefer this domain server". However that has no effect.  Delving into logs I can see the following from "opendirectoryd"  precodequeuing request to connection - '&lt;private&gt;' Client: &lt;private&gt;, UID: 0, EUID: 0, GID: 0, EGID: 0 Client: &lt;private&gt;, UID: 1234567, EUID: 1234567, GID: 1234568, EGID: 1234569 finding record to do authentication queuing request to connection - '&lt;private&gt;' * continuing with offline authentication for cached user Verify password result: 0 finding record to do authentication queuing request to connection - '&lt;private&gt;' * setting policies / password for offline account is not allowed * Change password result: 5200 /code/pre  I've highlighted the lines (*) with the most pertinent messages. I don't understand why it thinks I'm offline when the AD domain controller is reachable.
