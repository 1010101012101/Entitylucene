Easy way to see a list of all the apps I have installed on my iPhone <body> I'm looking for an easy way to see a list of all the apps that are currently installed on my iPhone (running iOS9). In earlier versions of iOS it was possible to just type a '.' into Spotlight and all the apps would come up in a list, but I haven't found a way to do this easily on iOS 9.  <answer244439> The only way to achieve this so far is by  ol liOpening strongSettings/strong /li listrongScrolling down/strong until the last section, there you'll find a stronglist/strong of all the strongApps/strong installed on your current iDevice/li /ol  Hope this helped you out!  <answer270522> There is a way.

Choose your device while connected via USB and go to "Actions-export-informations" in the top menu bar.

Apps can't see other apps anymore.
