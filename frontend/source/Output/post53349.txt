Disable system wide Ctrl+Click in OS X <body> I'm used to navigating through my code using kbdCtrl/kbd+Click. In OS X this function still works in my IDE, but it opens a context menu as well, which is very annoying!  I've done lots of Googling and didn't manage to find any answers that would let me disable kbdCtrl/kbd+Click system-wide in OS X 10.6.7. All the answers that I was able to find refer to Fusion and VMware.  I have a proper mouse with two buttons, I never used kbdCtrl/kbd+Click and cannot see the use case for it. Could someone please tell me how to disable it?  <answer53351> It's not possible to disable kbdCtrl/kbd+Click at a system-wide level. You have two options: use kbdCommand/kbd+Click which is the emde facto/em standard in all the Mac IDEs (which would be my suggestion, since going against such a well-established OS convention brings more headaches than it's worth), or configure your IDE to disable the shortcut: as you have noticed, remote desktop and virtualization environments offer the possibility.  <answer79901> You can map control+click to command+click globally with KeyRemap4Macbook. Put the following in your private.xml:  precode&lt;root&gt;     &lt;item&gt;         &lt;name&gt;Control+LeftClick Command+LeftClick&lt;/name&gt;         &lt;appendix&gt;Control+LeftClick Command+LeftClick&lt;/appendix&gt;         &lt;identifier&gt;control_click_to_command_click&lt;/identifier&gt;         &lt;autogen&gt;--PointingButtonToPointingButton-- PointingButton::LEFT, ModifierFlag::CONTROL_L, PointingButton::LEFT, ModifierFlag::COMMAND_L&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  This will cause any kbdctrl/kbd-click you type to be seen by the system as kbdâŒ˜/kbd-click.  That will prevent the contextual menu (since you won't actually be producing a kbdctrl/kbd).  You'll still need to change your IDE settings, but this way you can keep the muscle-memory for the shortcut.  <comment61019> I don't think you can disable Control-Clicks. Can you maybe configure your editor/code browser to use Command-Clicks? <comment61021> Yes, I could, but I don't want to. I think there should be a way to do it (sudo edit some prefs or something). <comment61023> You can remap the Ctrl key but this is system-wide then. <comment61024> Again a possibility, but I'd rather have the Ctrl key behave as a Ctrl key. I cannot believe disabling this "feature" is so difficult! <comment61025> I agree that using cmd+Click is the best potential solution. I just wanted to know if it's possible to disable it altogether and it seems a shame it isn't.  The reason why I wanted to use Ctrl+Click instead is because most of the time I work on Windows and only every so often work on a Mac. With Windows keyboard plugged in I want the transition between OSs to be as seamless as possible. <comment61028> @Artur what do you do about copy/paste as you have the same cmd control key issue? <comment61029> @Mark I'm using IntelliJ IDEA and it remaps these keys for you as well. <comment220671> This one worked great. I think the app is called Karabiner now. There's a button to open private.xml in its Misc & Uninstall tab. After editing the file reload it (Reload XML button on Change Key tab) and enable remapping (same tab) <comment279964> Thank you @OlegMikheev, but this disables the short cut when another app wants to use it
