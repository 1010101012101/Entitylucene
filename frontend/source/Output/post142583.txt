Where is Java installed in OSX Mavericks? <body> I am setting up Maven on my Mac but it is not working because the JAVA_HOME variable is not defined. I had expected the java installer to create this but alas not.  Where is java installed so I can create this variable myself?  <answer142584> precode/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/&lt;version&gt;.jdk/Contents/Home /code/pre  <answer142593> George Garside's path is correct. Latest JDK released today from Oracle. I advise downloading directly from Oracle's Site. Use the symlink to create your codeJAVA_HOME/code variable.  Add the following to your code.bash_profile/code or code.bashrc/code profile.   precodeexport JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home) /code/pre  Just downloaded the kit and added the above to my code.bash_profile/code. As you can see, variable is now clearly defined:  precodeMacbook-Pro:~ njboot$ echo $JAVA_HOME /code/pre  Returns:  precode/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_20.jdk/Contents/Home /code/pre  <comment168003> @dmeehan you're welcome. cheers. <comment168159> It's not your time, is it?
