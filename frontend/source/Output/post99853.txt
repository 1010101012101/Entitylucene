iPhone 4 audio only works for a few seconds <body> I've had my iPhone 4 for a long time, and I don't really want to get a new one. I'm trying to find a solution to fix it. The alert sound, key clicks and lock sound still work, but sound through the headphones and speakers only work for a few seconds at a time. I have to press Pause and wait a few seconds for it to work again.
