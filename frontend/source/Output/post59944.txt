Change Menu-Bar Font? <body> Is there a way to change the menu bar font/font color/font size? I don't want to change the menu bar color, just the font.  <answer59948> Short answer, no. It's been asked many times on many apple forums.  If you just need bigger text, the only sort of solution is to reduce your screen res.  <comment68991> Although it's pretty funny that this question is the sixth hit on that search. <comment69163> Shows you how fast google index's this site :-) <comment69167> Some other fonts or font sizes can be changed with [TinkerTool or by adding keys to .GlobalPreferences.plist](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/29797/how-to-change-the-finder-title-bar-font-from-the-command-line). I tried adding keys for `NSMenuFontSize` and `NSMenuBarFontSize` (found with with strings), but they didn't seem to have any effect.
