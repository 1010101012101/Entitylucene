After downloading file installer process runs and uses all memory <body> When I download a file from the internet a process starts with name "installer" and uses all the available memory until my Mac crashes.  It's not related to the browser — I tested with Chrome and Safari.br The only solution I have is to kill the process from Terminal.  What is installer? How can I delete installer process from my Mac?  I have a 15″ Retina MacBook Pro with 16 GB memory.  <answer259338> I used EasyFind. It located right away all the files and folders matching my research criterias (in that specific case I was looking for "installer") Deleted it right away. Worked like a charm!  <comment151476> What is it you are trying to download? Or does it happen with all downloads. <comment151481> Yes it happen for all download and it's run for each download it means that if i download two file in one time it's process run two time. <comment217640> @Majid, can you found any solutions regarding installer file issue? It' s always required to kill using activity monitor.
