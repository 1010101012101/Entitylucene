MacBook Pro freeze and goes off by kernel panic <body> For several weeks, my mac bug when I use Chrome or Photoshop. The mouse cursor make rainbow loops, for 2/3 minutes I can't do anything and voilà,  it turns off alone ! This happens 2/3 times a day!  Does anyone have the same problem recently? Thank you for your help.

The first thing I would do is to test whether this behaviour is replicated in Safe Mode.  strongBoot into Safe Mode/strong  Follow these steps to boot your MacBook Pro into Safe Mode:  ol liFully shut down your MacBook Pro/li liRestart your MacBook Pro/li liImmediately press the kbdShift/kbd key and strongkeep it down/strong /li liLet go of the kbdShift/kbd key when you see the login window (NOTE: If you have FileVault enabled you may need to log in twice)./li liTake a note of what happens (i.e. is the issue still present when using Chrom and/or Photoshop)/li liNow exit Safe Mode by restarting your MacBook Pro as normal/li liOnce logged in again, test to see whether the behaviour continues/li /ol  Now, depending on the above testing, we can narrow down how to proceed:  ul liIf the problem strongis/strong still present emduring/em Safe Mode and afterwards, proceed to strong1. Run Apple Diagnostics/strong (see below). /li liIf the problem strongis not/strong present during Safe Mode then it's time to investigate login items, fonts, and kernel extensions. If that's the case, proceed to strong2. Investigating login items, fonts, and kernel extensions/strong (see below)./li /ul  hr strong1. Run Apple Diagnostics/strong  Follow the steps below to run Apple Diagnostics:  ol liFully shut down your MacBook Pro/li liRestart your MacBook Pro/li liImmediately press the kbdD/kbd key and strongkeep it down/strong until you see the Diagnostics screen appear/li liWait for Diagnostics to finish (this typically only takes a few minutes)/li liOnce complete, one of two things will appear on the screen:  ul lia emNo issues found/em message/li lia brief description of any errors found plus further instructions/li /ul/li liIf the diagnostics test does find errors, take a note of what they are/li /ol  If you get an error let me know the results. If you get no error, skip to strong3. Some suggestions re Google Chrome, Photoshop and macOS Sierra/strong.  strongNote:/strong If pressing and holding the kbdD/kbd key at Step 3 doesn't work, start again at Step 1 and, at Step 3 press and hold both the kbdOption/kbdkbdD/kbd keys instead. This will try and run diagnostics from the internet instead, so you will need to allow more time for it to complete.   hr strong2. Investigating login items, fonts, and kernel extensions/strong  Let's start with Login Items:  ol liStartup normally/li liGo to System Preferences  Users &amp; Groups/li liSelect the Login Items tab/li liTake a note of your Login Items /li liNow remove all of them by highlighting them and clicking on the kbd-/kbd button below/li liRestart your computer/li /ol  Now your Mac will boot up without those login items loading. Test this and see if the problem persists:   ul liIf the problem goes away you know one (or more) of the Login items were causing the problem. You can then add them back in one by one until you've identified the culprit. Problem solved./li liIf the problem does persist, it's either a problem with fonts you've installed yourself or with a 3rd party kernel extension. A little more info below:/li /ul  strongFonts:-/strong You can remove any of the fonts you've installed yourself to see if this makes a difference.  strongKernel Extensions:-/strong You can open Terminal (found within your Utilites folder) and enter the following command:  codekextstat | grep -v com.apple/code  The above command will list 3rd party kernel extensions (you may need to stretch the Terminal window so it's easier to read). Look for anything you don't remember installing, or something that belongs to software you've removed, or just anything that looks out of place. Remember though, this is a list of strong3rd party kernel extensions/strong and therefore any of them could be causing the problem.  hr strong3. Some suggestions re Google Chrome, Photoshop and macOS Sierra/strong  I would try the following suggestions to see if they have any impact on what's going on.  strongGoogle Chrome/strong  I would strongly consider not using Chrome for a few days as a test. However, if you need to, there’s actually a setting in Google Chrome that may help you:  ol liGo to Chrome  Preferences/li liScroll down to the bottom/li liClick on emShow advanced settings…/em/li liScroll down to the emSystem/em heading/li liUncheck the emUse hardware acceleration when available/em option/li /ol  strongAdobe Photoshop/strong  Likewise, you may be able to tinker with Photoshop’s settings as well. Depending on the version you use, if you go to Photoshop’s Preferences and look under the Performance category, there should be a section for GPU Settings. By going into its Advanced Settings you may be able to try different options for the mode of use. It will probably default to Normal, but you could change it to Basic and see whether Photoshop plays more nicely with your MBP. Under GPU settings you could also switch off OpenGL Drawing altogether, but that may limit some functionality.  strongmacOS Sierra/strong  There are a couple of things you can do within Sierra:  ul liYou’re probably already aware of this one – but for your MBP you should have an additional setting under System Preferences  Energy Saver for Automatic graphics switching. Playing with this and the other Graphics option (for better battery life) may be useful./li liNow this one is not so obvious:  ol liGo to System Preferences/li liClick on Accessibility/li liSelect Display (in the left-hand column)/li liTick the Reduce transparency box (on the right-hand side)/li liExit System Preferences/li /ol/li /ul  After making these changes, use your Mac long enough to see what difference, if any, they make. This is basically a troubleshooting step to help narrow down the possible cause of your problem, so let me know how you go.  <comment370778> Thanks for your time. I just disable some kext... like Paragon NTFS, 4 virtualbox kext... i wll see !
