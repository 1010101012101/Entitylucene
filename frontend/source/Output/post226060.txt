How do I use Regedit on PlayOnMac <body> I wanted to change a few keys. And also add a few files for a program. How do I do this?  <comment274434> Mac doesn't have a registry. What exactly is it you are trying to achieve? <comment274442> @Tetsujin But PlayOnMac (based on wine) may contain a [registry](https://www.winehq.org/docs/wineusr-guide/using-regedit) <comment274445> @klanomath - sorry, I hadn't even looked at what the app was. <comment274489> @PrateekNarendra, Just select an installed app in the **PlayOnMac** app window and right-click _(control-click)_ it. This bring up a _context menu_ in which you select **Registry Editor** from, as shown in this [**image**](http://imgur.com/iilRUkr). <comment274559> @user3439894 i figured it out. Thanks anyways. If u write an answer, ill upvote :) <comment274567> @PrateekNarendra, I can't write it as an answer because there is a hold on it.  Anyway, I wanted you to have an answer regardless of getting points.
