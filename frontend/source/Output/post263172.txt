Mount NAS in CLI without Finder <body> We have a Synology NAs running as one of our backup servers, and also storing music.  Just occasionally, however, it will umount and I then have to go into the Finder and remount it.   I have tried various Terminal options to remount the disc, but without success:   codemount -t smbfs //john:password@nas/john_backup_NAS /Users/john/nas/code  That didn't work.    codeopen 'smb://john:password@nas/john_backup_NAS'/code  No luck either.  Maybe complicated by the fact that my password has the ampersand, a couple of backslashes, and the #?   Can someone advise as to the syntax?  <comment329727> I'm going to close this as duplicate of the masking question. Darren - if you edit the post to narrow down the specific error or specific string in question - we might want to reopen this for a specific answer as opposed to another general answer on how to handle the class. It's confusing that you mention you are in the finder to remount but your commands are all command line. Maybe we're missing some of your end goal here?
