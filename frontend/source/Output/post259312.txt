Mac Boot Disk for VM to install Mac Capitan <body> I am new to Mac and I couldn't find a suitable Q&amp;A better than this to ask my question.  I am running a Windows 8.1 and I have VirtualBox 5 already installed on my machine. I have a Mac Capitan dmg file which is not boot-able. I am looking for Mac boot disk so that I can start up my VM and install Capitan on it.  I have already tried HackBoot1 and Hackbook2 from here and iBoot from here and none worked for me so far. It gives  BIOS disk read error at sector : 00000011.  Please let me know if you have any solution to this.  Your help is much appreciate it.  Regards
