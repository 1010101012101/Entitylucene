What could be the reason why Finder lags? <body> Lately, Finder takes at least 30 secs to respond to the following prompts (1) when I click on a folder to see its contents (2) when I create a new folder (3) when I select a couple of files and click "New Folder with Selection" in the File menu  There are more just that I can't remember now.  So Finder lags, and my mouse cursor changes to that icon that shows something is loading. But I can switch to other apps and still use them during that period.  Why does Finder lag, and how can I improve the performance?  <comment280224> If you open Activity monitor: 1) Is the memory pressure high or low? 2) Is CPU busy? (be sure to show all processes) Also, once you've checked - is this something that a restart cures? <comment280245> What version of OS X are you using? Do you have any Adobe Creative Cloud applications installed? <comment281800> @NSGod: OS 10.8.5. No, no Adobe Creative Cloud applications. <comment281801> @bmike: I can't seem to see my memory pressure. Is it because of my OS version? Anyway I am attaching the screenshots of Activity Monitor. Oh no, restart doesn't cure it :( <comment281803> @bmike: http://snag.gy/YF4Ey.jpg <comment281804> @bmike: http://snag.gy/0XNwa.jpg
