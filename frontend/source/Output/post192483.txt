Reopen Swift 2.0 migration tool in Xcode 7 <body> I just opened a Swift project on the new Xcode 7.   I didn't really look on what button I clicked and closed the migration tools without migrating anything.   Any idea how I could reopen it?  <answer192719> To begin migration to swift 2.0 latest syntax, open your Xcode project with xcode7, Click emEdit  Convert/em.
