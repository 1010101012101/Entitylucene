sudo requires root password <body> I've got an admin user codephil/code with password codeorange/code, and the root user is enabled with password codebanana/code:  ul liIf I type codesudo ls/code, and enter the password codeorange/code, I get codeSorry, try again./code/li liIf I type codesudo ls/code, and enter the password codebanana/code, it works./li /ul  If I disable the root user, sudo doesn't accept either password.  What the heck is going on?  <answer106429> If your user is an admin, they should (by default) be able to use codesudo/code (based on the contents of the sudoers file).  If you re-enable the root user, and examine the contents of the file at code/etc/sudoers/code, you should find this line (which specifies that the admin group has the ability to use codesudo/code):  precode%admin  ALL=(ALL) ALL /code/pre  It may be a good idea to confirm that "phil" is in the admin users group. You can perfom this check on the command line using this command (after you've re-enabled root, of course):  precodesudo dseditgroup -o checkmember -m phil admin /code/pre  It's also possible that the coderootpw/code flag may be set in the code/etc/sudoers/code file (this should be off by default). If you find the following line in that file, see if deleting it will help:  precodeDefaults rootpw /code/pre  <comment125025> "yes phil is a member of admin", and that line is present in `/etc/sudoers`. <comment125026> @bonh - I've added an additional suggestion to the answer above (`rootpw`) <comment125111> that did it!  I found `Defaults rootpw` in `/etc/sudoers` and deleted it, and now I can `sudo` with my user password, as expected.  Thanks!
