Intel Core 2 Duo and Yosemite <body> I have a iMac circa 2009/2010 running a 2.66GHz Intel Core 2 Duo, with 2GB RAM installed.  If I was to upgrade to Yosemite, even with an upgrade to 8GB RAM, would this be enough to run Yosemite well? (Well as in comfortably useable, not freezing and becoming sluggish each time you open a browser tab or app).  If not, what would the most recent version of OS X I could run and maintain a quick machine? Currently on 10.6.   Mostly general use, but occasional use a home office machine, running Adobe CS4 etc.   <comment202348> Yosemite can go as far back as mid 2007 models. <comment202364> [How to install OS X Yosemite on your Mac](http://support.apple.com/en-au/HT201475). I run OS X 10.9.5 (Mavericks) on a Late 2008 Aluminum Macbook with a Core 2 Duo, 2.4 GHz, and 8 GB and an external 1680x1050 monitor. Seems to do okay. Been holding off on Yosemite waiting for all the network issues to settle down. There can be privacy issues. I'd prefer it if Calendar could be disabled doing web searches for location matches even when location services are disabled. <comment202577> Thanks @ Buscarì›ƒ , but I want to know what specs will run Yosemite **well**, not just whether it _can_.  I seem to remember running Tiger on a G3 Powermac, which was painful to use - I want to avoid this scenario. Would much rather have an outdated OS that runs well, than an up to date OS that runs slowly.
