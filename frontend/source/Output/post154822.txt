Why is my Partition a folder? <body> I've set up a iMac12,1 with Yosemite (fresh) on a second partition. Then I've formatted my first partition (after i migrated my data from my old installation to my Yosemite installation on the 2nd partition)  After formatting, I am presented by a Folder icon in Disk Utility: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1aeYP.png" alt="Disk Utility showing folder" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZsirG.png" alt="enter image description here"  But to actually access the folder i had to chown it to my user. What is happening here? The mac also randomly choses to fail at the boot screen, but after some codefsck -fy/code in SU mode it boots again like nothing happened.  UPDATE: Tried formatting the partition again, now i get an error saying that the media cannot be deactivated. I guess OSX just recognizes that this is indeed a folder and unmounting a folder leads to this error. Another thing what striked me: there are apparently 132.629 Folders in this partition (disk utility says that)  precodediskutil list:  /dev/disk0    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:                  Apple_HFS HDD                     499.7 GB   disk0s2    3:                  Apple_HFS Yosemite                499.0 GB   disk0s3    4:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s4 /dev/disk1    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.1 TB     disk1    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk1s1    2:                  Apple_HFS Disk Image              1.1 TB     disk1s2 /code/pre  diskutil cs list:  precodeNo CoreStorage logical volume groups found /code/pre  /etc/auto_master:  precodecat /etc/auto_master # # Automounter master map # +auto_master        # Use directory service /net            -hosts      -nobrowse,hidefromfinder,nosuid /home           auto_home   -nobrowse,hidefromfinder /Network/Servers    -fstab /-          -static /code/pre  diskutil info /Volumes/HDD  precodediskutil info /Volumes/HDD Could not find disk: /Volumes/HDD /code/pre  diskutil info disk0s2  precodediskutil info disk0s2    Device Identifier:        disk0s2    Device Node:              /dev/disk0s2    Part of Whole:            disk0    Device / Media Name:      Customer     Volume Name:              HDD     Mounted:                  Yes    Mount Point:              /Volumes/HDD     File System Personality:  Journaled HFS+    Type (Bundle):            hfs    Name (User Visible):      Mac OS Extended (Journaled)    Journal:                  Journal size 90112 KB at offset 0x1980f000    Owners:                   Enabled     Partition Type:           Apple_HFS    OS Can Be Installed:      Yes    Media Type:               Generic    Protocol:                 SATA    SMART Status:             Verified    Volume UUID:              3B40521B-D7F0-3924-9F4E-D9A9FC2FEC16    Disk / Partition UUID:    00004DD6-4AB2-0000-A05F-0000E4410000     Total Size:               499.7 GB (499672563712 Bytes) (exactly 975922976 512-Byte-Units)    Volume Free Space:        863.4 GB (863430361088 Bytes) (exactly 1686387424 512-Byte-Units)    Device Block Size:        512 Bytes    Allocation Block Size:    4096 Bytes     Read-Only Media:          No    Read-Only Volume:         No    Ejectable:                No     Whole:                    No    Internal:                 Yes    Solid State:              No /code/pre  UPDATE: I had a Applescript mounting a sparsebundle Image from a Samba Server for Time Machine Backups (see @klanomath's answer) This script uses perl to execute a system command - codehdiutil attach/code I don't know why, but the existing Mountpoints somehow get messed up when using this script. After updating it with @klanomath's suggestion, Time Machine still runs fine and the mounts in /Volumes seem correct, but the script seems to mirror all of my Volumes in /Volumes/HDDBackup.

I can live with that :) thanks @klanomath!  Thanks!  <answer154853> The phenomenon derives from a faulty codeApple Script/code mounting a codeTime Machine sparsebundle image/code from a smb-share serving as a codeTime Machine backup volume/code to code/Volumes/code. The mounted image interferes with (maybe any) other mounted volume(s) there  The faulty codeApple Script/code:    precodetry  mount volume "smb://someserver/DATA"  end try  do shell script "/usr/bin/perl -Ue '$&lt; = $&gt;; system(@ARGV)' hdiutil attach -nobrowse -mountpoint /Volumes/ /Volumes/DATA/{...}/Timemachine/MGTimeMachine.sparsebundle" with administrator privileges /code/pre  One possibility is to improve the script by changing the mountpoint from /Volumes to /Volumes/HDDBackup:  precodetry  mount volume "smb://someserver/DATA"  end try  do shell script "/usr/bin/perl -Ue '$&lt; = $&gt;; system(@ARGV)' hdiutil attach -nobrowse -mountpoint /Volumes/HDDBackup /Volumes/DATA/{...}/Timemachine/MGTimeMachine.sparsebundle" with administrator privileges /code/pre  Probably you have to change your time machine settings afterwards. Please check if this works out for you.  The other possibility is to disable your apple script, restart the Mac, cloning disk0s3 to disk0s2, deleting disk0s3 after booting from disk0s2 and expanding disk0s2 to fill the whole hdd.br Enable your apple script after finishing all steps successfully.  <comment182121> is there a special reason why you didn't enable journaling for 'HDD'? Please add the content of /etc/auto_master to your question. <comment182122> I'm pretty sure I formatted it with OSX extended with journaling, OSX just didn't get it it seems... just tried to format again to make sure, but it says that it couldn't deactivate the medium (which is normal i guess, you can't unmount a folder)... <comment182124> please also add the output of 'diskutil list' and 'diskutil cs list' <comment182126> @klanomath updated :) <comment182143> i think your mounted disk image interferes with your disk0s2 . looks like both are mounted to /Volumes/HDD (capacity: 500 GB = free & used space 1,1 TB) <comment182145> Can you check what's mounted at `/Volumes/HDD` and what is hapenning with disk0s2? `diskutil info /Volumes/HDD` and `diskutil info disk0s2` <comment182146> http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/18414/why-is-my-partition-a-folder <comment182294> Yep, without my faulty mount script, the Volume gets detected correctly and it seems Time Machine runs fine without a change. Disk Utility takes a minute to inspect the Volumes, but I can live with that! I may move my installation to the first partition sometime in the future, thanks for your help - greetings to berlin! ;)
