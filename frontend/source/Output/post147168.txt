Apple Mid 2012 VGA vs Apple retina late 2013 VGA onboard <body> I'm trying to buy a new mac book. I have two choices: one is Apple Macbook Pro retina mid 2012 with NVIDIA GeForce GT 650M 1024 MB. And another is new macbook late retina 2013 using VGA onboard.  I have googled but found no answer for comparison between those graphics. Does NVIDIA Graphics card is really stronger than core i5 VGA onboard (gen 4) ?  @: sub question: about SSD, I see some benchmark, and see that SSD on 2013 is faster than SSD on 2012. Does this true ?  Thanks :)   <answer147176> I found out here that the difference is very minor in gaming performances.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/clVhj.jpg" alt="comparison"  Not to mention that the NVIDIA is a add on device while the Intel is integrated,resulting in more power consumption and graphics mode switching--that you might not want.  <comment173481> are you playing heavy duty graphics games ? <comment173482> No. i just use graphic software design often. such as Photoshop. AI. Unity ... :) <comment173485> thanks :) so it looks like intel makes vga onboard so good :) can you tell me about ssd part. does 2013 line will faster than 2012. thanks :) <comment173488> Actually it looks like Intel will severely damage the NVIDA business if they continue this road of superior GPU designs. <comment173491> Yes it does read/write faster due to the SSD connector technology change from (SATA to PCIe). <comment173492> except that, are there any differences in SSD technology, or all of ssd part uses same technology ? thanks :) <comment173518> sorry, could you ask that as a new question, something like what is the SSD technology differences on Mac models, since the comments here are not meant for extended discussions
