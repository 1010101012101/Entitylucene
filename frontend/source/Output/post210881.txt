iCloud event invitation delivered by email instead of by calendar app <body> I can connect to icloud via two emails:  codexxxxxx@gmail.com/code - primary, and codexxxxxx@icloud.com/code - secondary. Is it important which email was used to invite me to event? On the device I can be logged via both of them to EXACTLY THE SAME ACCOUNT. Currently on the device I am logged in via codexxxxxx@icloud.com/code. Shouldn't I get invitation in calendar app even an invitation was adressed to codexxxxxx@gmail.com/code?  Because when invitation was sent to code@gmail.com/code I was invited via email, otherwise I get notification via calendar app. Is not weird?  I need to understand this.  <comment254546> Have You set up Your gmail account to synchronize calendars? <comment254549> In `Settings - Mail, Contacts, Calendars - xxxxxx@gmail.com` Calendars is switched off. Shortly... I haven't. <comment254550> Thats the reason why You do not get invites to the Calendar.app I suppose <comment254558> You do not understand, it is not that, This options is whether to sync google calendar events in calendar app. The invitation from question is NOT from google, it is from APPLE, delivered via google account. That is the point. Shouldn't be like that.
