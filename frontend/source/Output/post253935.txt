What is ZoomWindow, and why is it hanging? <body> I updated to MacOS Sierra, and since then I have been getting a message (via CleanMyMac which tells me this sort of thing) that ZoomWindow is not responding.  I get the impression that ZoomWindow is part of the system, but anything I find on the Internet is either uninformative or useless.  What is ZoomWindow, and should it be unresponsive like this?  <answer256662> I think that ZoomWindow is AppleMenu  SystemPreferences  Accessibility  Reduce/Zoom (sorry, my Sierra is French based)  A friend of me as the same problem with the ZoomWindow and CleanMyMac.  Still trying to find the solution.  Phil  <comment321204> Same here ZoomWindwow reported as hanging with CleanMyMac. No help from CleanMyMac online support either.
