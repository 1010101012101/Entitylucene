How do I set the creation time of a file? <body> I have a script that converts a file to another format, and I want the resulting file to have the same timestamps as the original, including the creation time (as shown by codels -lU/code).  I can use touch to set the access and modification time, but I don't see a way to set the creation time.  <answer16826> precodetouch -t YYYYMMDDhhmm file.ext /code/pre  This will set the modification and creation dates of a file. I ran it on a file I created this morning, and here's what Get Info says:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Lg2tA.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer59852> SetFile can also be used to set the creation date before the modification date or in the future.  precode-d date    Sets the creation date, where date is a string of the            form: "mm/dd/[yy]yy [hh:mm:[:ss] [AM | PM]]" Notes:            Enclose the string in quotation marks if it contains spa-            ces. The date must be in the Unix epoch, that is, between            1/1/1970 and 1/18/2038. If the year is provided as a two-            digit year, it is assumed to be in the 21st century and            must be from 00 (2000) through 38 (2038). /code/pre  This would set the creation date to the modification date:  precodeSetFile -d "$(GetFileInfo -m test.txt)" test.txt /code/pre  SetFile and GetFileInfo are part of the command line tools package, which can be downloaded from developer.apple.com/downloads or from Xcode's preferences after installing it from the App Store.  <comment18385> I should of course have tested this first :-) Thanks <comment68105> Nathan, did the file exist before you "touched" it? `touch` doesn't change creation dates unless it creates the file itself. <comment117121> -1 `touch` will only set the creation date of a file if it creates the file, _or if the new date is earlier than the file's creation date_. (It's impossible to have a file whose modification date is earlier than its creation date.) So this solution does not work if the new date is later than the file's creation date. The `SetFile` solution will always work.
