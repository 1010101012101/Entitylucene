How to automate a simple mouse action? <body> When I'm writing notes in Evernote, I constantly need to change the font of blocks of text to Courier New. What I usually do is select the text, click on Fonts dropdown and select Courier New. I have to do this all the time so it's kind of a bore.  I want to automate this so that all I need is to select the text and press a key combination to change the font.  What are my options? (Any in-built way or third party apps)  <comment208819> I don't have Evernote to test. Does it have a direct menu method to get the font you need. e.g. Edit menu Fonts  Courier New ? If it does, I might have a way. <comment208829> @Tetsujin No, there's no such direct menu item for changing fonts. (anyways, how do i do it if it had one?) <comment208831> System prefs  Keyboard  Shortcuts - will allow you to add a custom key command to any menu item <comment208868> I see, thanks! Maybe there are 3rd party apps that can automate something which isn't a menu item? <comment208876> There was always [QuicKeys](http://startly.com/products/quickeys/mac/4/), which used to be the absolute go-to app for anything like this, but its development has fallen a long way behind in recent years & needs [specific instructions](http://startly.com/support/) on making it work on anything above Snow Leo. Upside is you can run it in trial mode forever, until you decide you like it or not
