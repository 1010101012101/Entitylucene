How much RAM can a 2007 iMac hold? <body> The box says I can add up to 3 GB (for a total of 4GB), but is this restriction hardware based, or because of the operating system?  If I upgrade to OS X 10.6 or higher, can I increase the RAM to 8 GB like the newer models?  <answer26452> According to MacTracker, it looks like Apple officially supports a 4GB configuration, but it emcan/em hold up to 6GB. (This is for model "iMac8,1").  <comment30198> Apple's take on the matter: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1593 Maximum installable RAM is outside of software. The amount only takes into consideration hardware configurations.
