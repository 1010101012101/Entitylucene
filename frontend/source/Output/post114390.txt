What is the font the battery percentage uses? <body> A bit of a stupid question, but what is the font the battery percentage (pictured below) in OS X uses?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/q8udx.png" alt="82"  It is strongnot/strong the standard font you can get by calling code[NSFont menuBarFontOfSize:0]/code, I have noticed.  <answer114394> It's very likely to be Lucida Grande 13pt (It's the system default font).   <comment134063> awesome, thanks!
