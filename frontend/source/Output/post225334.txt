Prevent & disable iPhone iOS 9.2 from forced/ pushed auto downloading updates? <body> Prevent &amp; disable iPhone iOS 9.2 from auto downloading updates?   iPhone 5 iOS 9.2 -   Today morning found it had auto downloaded 9.2.1 update - Around 200-400 MB.   I have a data cap with ISP so I dont want this happening on Apple's control.   How can I prevent &amp; disable this?   I found these older articles but does not seem to have worked/ stopped the download.   https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7256669?tstart=0  https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7250272?tstart=0  <answer225371> Really, if your iPhone is on Wi-Fi and an update is available, it will download the update when you're probably asleep (2:00-4:00AM). There is no way to disable this.  A workaround would be to turn Wi-Fi on your iPhone off when you go to bed.  <answer247687> The closest I came was preventing all my iOS devices from emreaching/em the update server. This envolves configuring your internet router in order to do so.  Configure your router to block the following domain: codemesu.apple.com/code  Doing so will still allow your iDevice to talk to the Apple Store, allowing you to download/update iOS Apps.  Some routers (like mine) only allow me to block 'web sites' not domains. Luckily, that is all we need to do. Blocking codehttps://mesu.apple.com/code also does the trick.  I would say blocking the whole domain is a cleaner solution if possible however.  <comment273588> So this is a new thing that iOS 9.2 does automatically?  So, on 3G, WiFi disabled, it wont do so? <comment273631> @AlexS It's not new for iOS 9.2, but I'm not sure when this started. If you turn your Wi-Fi off it likely shouldn't download the update over LTE or 3G. <comment273641> Thanks for posting the links to the discussions ... Yeah seems it's really hard to find a solid answer on this, I don't think the Wi-fi assist feature is relevant here and I don't think there's an "app" listed under Cellular Data, if you turned off all cellular data it would stop this but that's no fun! <comment273985> Just make sure that Use Cellular Data is not turned on in the iTunes and App Store menu of your device's Settings. <comment274008> @angelplayer Actually, I think that that's different. One can't even download an update over cellular if he wanted to, so iOS doesn't do it by itself. <comment305643> Welcome to Ask Different!  Please don't give link-only answers.

Thanks for pointing that out. I am used to having to reference material where I obtained my information. But... behold! the link I had in my answer indeed expired and no longer worked.
