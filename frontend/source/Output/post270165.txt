Macports: switching back to the system default version of Python <body> I'm trying to use Macports to switch back to the system default version of python.  When I run this command:  precodeport select --list python /code/pre  I get back :  precodeAvailable versions for python:     none     python26-apple     python27     python27-apple (active)     python34 /code/pre  So for example, I want to switch back to the codeusr/bin/python/code (which is the apple version of python), I would enter this into the terminal:  precode sudo port select --set python python26-apple /code/pre  It says:     Selecting 'python26-apple' for 'python' succeeded. 'python26-apple' is   now active.   But, when I run codewhich python/code, it gives me this:  precode/opt/local/bin/python /code/pre  Which is not the system default version of python. That is the Macports version of python as Macports installs all their python versions into the code/opt/local/bin/code directory.  I want to type in codewhich python/code and get back this when I switch to the apple version of python:  /usr/bin/python  When I type into Terminal codetype -a python/code, I get back these two versions of pythons installed on my mac. The first one is where all the Macports versions of python get installed. The second one is the system version of Python:  precodepython is /opt/local/bin/python python is /usr/bin/python /code/pre  I have read this post: How do I change back from MacPorts Python to system default version? however, it doesn't seem to address this problem.  <answer270290> code/opt/local/bin/python/code is a symbolic link to the active version of codepython/code. You can view the structure with the following command:  precodels -l /opt/local/bin/python* /code/pre  Since code/opt/local/bin/code is before code/usr/bin/code in your PATH variable then the symbolic link will be listed first but it points to the version in code/usr/bin/code.
