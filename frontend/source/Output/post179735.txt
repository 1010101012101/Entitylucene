iOS diagnostics test gives you new problems? <body> Has anyone gotten software problems after performing the iOS diagnostics test offered by Apple? (where you get a test URL from Apple support)  I can't connect to Gmail on Safari after the test... it keeps reloading. Logging out nor restarting is helping. Anyone with similar problems?  <answer179806> Have you tried restarting the device? This will wipe the cache, and perhaps solve your problem.
