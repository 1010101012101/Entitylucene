App Shortcuts missing in Keyboard preferences <body> I upgraded to Mavericks recently and it seems I am now missing the ability to set App Shortcuts. I only see the following in my Keyboard/Shortcuts preferences. Any thoughts on how to get App Shortcuts back?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LT6fK.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer127261> Drag the divider bar to the right to show the categories.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wStoo.gif" alt=""  <comment149278> Thank you, this was driving me up the wall! <comment157403> Thanks.. This was really such a simple answer. Apple should put a bit of instruction text at the bottom or make the slider more obvious for eye-strained users.
