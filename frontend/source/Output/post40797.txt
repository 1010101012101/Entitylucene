What different non-bluetooth keyboards exist for the iPad 2? <body> I am in the navy, and am restricted in the use of RF emissions such as WiFi and Bluetooth.  Is there a keyboard I can use with my iPad 2 that will plug into the 30-pin connector?  <answer40802> You'd want a wired keyboard such as this from DealExtreme. They ship to the US without any problems  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/O7ylO.jpg" alt="Wired keyboard"
