What's the difference between entering return, option (‚å•) + return and ctrl + return in TextEdit? <body> I don't seen anything different like below picture.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/M6Ll7.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer161664> Viewing two example files in TextEdit there is indeed no difference:  On the left side codeRich Text/code and on the right side codeSimple Text/code codeKeyboard Layout/code: de-de  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CJn4h.jpg" alt="textedit"  Viewing the same files with codeTextWrangler/code ("showing invisibles" enabled) the differences are revealed:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lLJWk.jpg" alt="textwrangler"  Viewing only the text file with codeTextWrangler/code ("hiding invisibles" enabled):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BVNid.jpg" alt="textwranglertxtonly"  the same file in HexFiend:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Eog0M.jpg" alt="hexfiend"  kbdReturn/kbd and kbdOption/kbdkbdReturn/kbd insert 0x0A (New Line) and kbdControl/kbdkbdReturn/kbd inserts 0xE2 0x80 0xA8 (Code Point Value: 2028, Unicode Name: Line Separator)  The difference is visible here:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vxj0Q.jpg" alt="textwrangler"  Inserting a lot of kbdq/kbds the whole second sequence of codeabcdefghijklmnop/code in the third line breaks to a "new line", while the same sequence in the second line continuously flows to a "new line".  <comment188855> There is no difference! <comment188889> I don't see why this is flagged as unclear...
