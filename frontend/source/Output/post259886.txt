Why doesn't "unexpected shutdown count" in MRI sometimes not update when I reset an iPhone? <body> Normally, if you reset an iPhone (force it to restart pressing power and home), it'll add 1 to the count in  "unexpected shutdown count" in MRI test.  but it sometimes doesn't increase the count, then if you reset it again, it'll increase the count by 2.  where's this count save? how can this be? It happened to me with different iPhones.
