Problems with Remote login <body> I have been using "Remote login" from my Windows machine to compile code but suddenly it isn't working anymore. When I'm using git bash I get this:  precodeJeggy@DESKTOP-J8SU11H MINGW64 ~ $ ssh jeggy@192.168.1.86 ssh: connect to host 192.168.1.86 port 22: Connection timed out /code/pre  Anyone that can help me to find out why it is not working? I have full access to the Mac also.  <comment334944> Perhaps the Mac's IP address has changed. You can find it behind the Advanced button in System Preferences, or by running `ifconfig -a` in a terminal window. <comment334947> no it's not that, i am getting the IP address directly from the system preferences sharing window <comment334949> Hmm. Can you even ping the machine? (Do windows machines *have* the ping command? I don't know.) If you can ping it, there might be a firewall issue. Otherwise, if `sshd` is not running, I would expect to see Connection refused, not a timeout. <comment334950> ah, pinging doesn't work either. Then it's probably a firewall thing :/ <comment334951> Maybe. But I don't think firewalls usually block ping, though it is possible to set them up to do so. Does the mac have internet access? Does the windows machine? <comment334952> yes both have. both on wifi <comment334953> Are they both in the same LAN? <comment334954> yes, it's a simple home network <comment334994> Try using bonjour name (name-of-computer.local)? <comment335094> `$ ssh Jogvans-MacBook-Air.local` Gave this: `ssh: Could not resolve hostname jogvans-macbook-air.local: Name or service not known` <comment335151> I know this should be the first thing I tried out, but rebooting the router fixed the issue.
