How to Keep Mac apps updated <body> Is their anyway to keep all apps installed on my mac updated? As soon as some new version for a particular app launches i get the update automatically. I checked few softwares but all of them are freemium, none of them is free. Luckily brew updates packages but what about apps?   If there is no such thing please guide me with way to write a program on my own for my mac(particularly in python).   <comment205574> Well, ignored for a global updating system to work, one need to create a global repository for all the apps and then keep it updated. The Mac App Store does this for apps purchased through it. Outside of the MAS each developer generally sells and distributes their apps themselves. Many build in update features in their apps, some don't. Writing your own method wouldn't be worth the trouble. MacUpdate is your best bet since they do the tricky parts for you. <comment205577> @sdmeyers but mac updates say subscribe you aren't left with any update <comment205587> Try [brew cask](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask), it's a pretty solution. <comment205802> @jherran can you please send me link for getting started with brew cast. I don't know it works. <comment205803> @androidplusios.design check [Installing Apps with Homebrew Cask](http://lapwinglabs.com/blog/hacker-guide-to-setting-up-your-mac) section for an explanation.
