How to combine multiple mailboxes in Mail.app? <body> My OS is Mavericks.  The mailboxes shown are grouped under headings MAILBOXES, SMART MAILBOXES, ON MY MAC, and MY EMAIL ADDRESS.  I have Sent and Trash under each.  Their contents are not entirely duplicative.  When I go to mailbox/use this mailbox as, the options are grayed out.  In Preferences/Accounts/Mailbox Behaviors all options are checked to 'store messages on server'.  How do I combine these mailboxes? Thanks, Rick  <answer140580> The Mailboxes that are created by Mail app can not be modfied.  Only Mailboxes that you created can be modified.  Thus: Inbox, Draft, Sent, Junk, Trash, Archive and "on My Mac mailboxes" can not be modified.  <answer140596> In the Menu Bar, go to Mailbox after selecting the sub-mailbox, one of your Sent folders, for instance, and then choose "Use This Mailbox Forâ€¦". You can lump the redundancies together this way, but it's true that you will not be able to completely customize all the boxes.   <comment165676> Where exactly do you go to when you try "mailbox/use this mailbox as"
