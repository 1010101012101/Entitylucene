How can I fix "MTM fs Mount server failed to start because of error 15"? <body> For the last few weeks, I've been getting lots of recurrent codeMTM fs Mount server failed to start because of error 15/code error messages in codesystem.log/code. How can I diagnose and fix this?  I don't know if it's causing any issues, but it's worrisome, and it's spamming the log file so I'm having trouble diagnosing other problems. Time Machine has also been wonky lately, failing to complete backups to external drives attached to my Time Capsule because it couldn't find the backup disk. (Backups to locally-attached drives work fine.) Maybe related, since codemtmfs/code is part of the Time Machine system.  Here's what it looks like, from codesystem.log/code as viewed in Console. There will be a sequence of errors and restart attempts, which then get throttled.  precodeNov 28 15:08:18 eilonwy.local mtmfs[379]: cannot bind custom tcp socket Nov 28 15:08:18 eilonwy.local mtmfs[379]: MTM fs Mount server failed to start because of error 15 Nov 28 15:08:19 eilonwy.local mtmfs[379]: MTM fs Mount server retrying ...

This is on OS X 10.8.5 on a Mid 2012 Retina MacBook Pro. codeeilonwy/code is the hostname of my machine.  I've looked through what little doco on codemtmfs/code I've found through codeman/code and Google, and while it tells how to start and stop it, I've found no info on what codeerror 15/code means, what "custom tcp socket" it might be trying to bind to and how to fix, and what the consequences of codemtmfs/code not running are.  I contacted Apple support and they suggested doing a "Repair Permissions" from Disk Utility, which I did and it didn't fix the problem, and then reinstalling OS X, which is a little aggressive (and Windows-y) for my taste.  Can anyone help me fix this, or point at some resources to help diagnose it?  <answer116031> I've had miserable luck interacting with mtmfs and fixing things when they go amiss. I do have good success in cleaning out the mobile store and starting the mobile backup portion clean.  Make a time machine backup with your normal destination drive mounted, then disable - let the system clean up the on-disk cache space and then re-enable the local snapshot store. You do lose any backup intervals that are not on the actual destination, but you also get a working set. Lastly, I would run codetmdiagnose/code to capture the failure before you clean up just in case it reappears and you can send both sets of diagnostic logs to Apple for analysis by engineering.  precodesudo -s tmutil startbackup --rotation --block tmdiagnose tmutil disablelocal sleep 30 tmutil enablelocal exit /code/pre  At this point, you'll want to test a backup or two and repeat the tmdiagnose if you happen to reproduce the issue:  precodetmutil snapshot sleep 15 tmutil startbackup --rotation --block sleep 15 tmutil snapshot /code/pre  <answer119098> I had the same problem and was due to errors in the localhost's IPv4 address in /etc/hosts. The daemon of mtmfs listening on localhost.  Check that this is the first line in /etc/hosts:  precode127.0.0.1       localhost /code/pre  Also you can test: (depends on the firewall options)  precode$ ping localhost /code/pre  Then turn off local Time Machine snapshots and trigger automatic cleanup of accumulated local snapshot data :  precode$ sudo tmutil disablelocal /code/pre  Reboot the mac, and turn on local Time Machine snapshots:  precode$ sudo tmutil enablelocal /code/pre  And it works without errors.  precode[system.log] mtmfs[40]: mount succeeded for /Volumes/MobileBackups /code/pre  <comment135783> Any success Andrew (or anyone else) in fixing this? I've got the same error repeating constantly. <comment135924> I eventually gave up, erased my drive, and did a fresh re-install of OS X 10.9. Error went away. (Just upgrading to 10.9 did not fix it.) <comment135925> +1 Thanks bmike! I didn't know about `tmdiagnose`; that looks helpful. I had tried `tmutil` `disablelocal`/`enablelocal`, but it didn't fix it. Maybe I didn't wait long enough between them? Anyway, I gave up and reformatted, so I can't test this for reproducibility. Don't know what the etiquette is wrt Accepting when the original situation is gone... <comment135926> @rtaustin - Can you give bmike's answer a try and let us know if it works for you? <comment135929> @AndrewJanke The best etiquette is to select some answer if the problem can no longer be reproduced. That spurs others to either edit the question to show how to reproduce it or ask a new question. You are encouraged to answer it yourself if for whatever reason selecting one of the existing answers. So, unless you want to tick mine as answering, go ahead and self-answer. <comment139172> Bingo! I pulled my old `/etc/hosts` from the time of the issue off backups, and indeed its `127.0.0.1` localhost entry was commented out and replaced by a normal `192.168.0.xxx` IP address. I can reproduce the exact symptoms by messing up `/etc/hosts` again, giving localhost an incorrect IP. (No idea why it got changed in the first place.) Your fix works. Thanks! <comment139173> @rtaustin: check BMourelo's new answer. Think he nailed it. <comment182129> Ditto bingo! I had 172.0.0.2 in my hosts file and it was defaulting to it. Removed. Fixed.
