The bottom of my iPhone won't accept touches. Can I fix that? <body> My iPhone (1st Gen) is no longer able to recognize when I touch it at the very bottom of the screen.  The only way this effects me is when I have the keyboard up I cant hit the 123, spacebar, or send.  Is there some way I can fix this?  I've tried restoring but that didn't do the trick.  Is this something that I can take in and have fixed?   <answer943> Off to the Genius Bar with you. Though I'm willing to bet they'll probably just recommend you get a new phone.  <answer946> They might do 1G here. Worked great when I busted my 3GS screen.  <answer948> Turns the phone upside down and hope that the app you are using supports that orientation :)  <comment782> I have a similar feeling.. <comment783> I only say it because I had an iPod battery go bad once outside of the warranty and the price to replace it was almost as a new one. I was told that was pretty much Apple's strategy when it came to mobile devices.
