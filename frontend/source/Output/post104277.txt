How do I move a USB Time Machine backup to a Time Capsule? <body> Is there a safe way to move a Time Machine backup on an external USB hard drive to a Time Capsule?  <answer104305> Yes, it's straightforward to do it, even though it would take quite sometime to complete depending on the size of your current backups. Follow the detailed procedure at Copy  Local  backups to be used on a  NETWORK.  Here's a summary of what's required and the steps.  The backups go into a sparsebundle on a codeTime Capsule/code. So you need to create that sparsebundle on the codeTime Capsule/code, mount it in codeFinder/code and then copy over everything from your USB drive into the mounted volume.  Here are the basic steps with some additional information:  ol liConfigure codeTime Machine/code to back up to the codeTime Capsule/code and start a backup. This will make it create the sparsebundle./li liCancel the backup once the copying starts (as seen in the progress window)./li liMount the codeTime Machine Backups/code sparsebundle in codeFinder/code by double-clicking it (or using kbdCmd/kbd+kbdDown Arrow/kbd)/li liDelete the codeBackups.backupdb/code folder inside this volume (you'll be replacing it with the backup you already have)./li liOpen your current codeTime Machine/code backup USB drive in codeFinder/code and copy the codeBackups.backupdb/code folder from it to the codeTime Machine Backups/code partition (mounted from the codeTime Capsule/code)./li liEnter your administrator password and accept the prompts (this may happen a couple of times)./li /ol  <comment279280> This would appear to no longer work in El Capitan as the sparsebundle mounts as read only. <comment282651> I'm on El Cap and I didn't have that problem. I would suggest however after step 2 to turn Time Machine off so it doesn't try to backup to the time capsule while you are also manually copying.
