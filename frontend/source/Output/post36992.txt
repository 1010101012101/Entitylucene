How can I navigate any directory in Finder? <body> The Finder shows several particular directories in the home folder. It does not even show directory I made in the home folder.  But I do want to navigate any directory of the file system. How can I do that?  <answer36993> To access any folder in Finder, press kbdCmd/kbd + kbdShift/kbd + kbdG/kbd and enter the directory you want to access.  <answer36995> h3Showing all files in Finder/h3  Type in the terminal     defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE   Then log out and back in.  <answer295026> In Finder there is a shortcut for toggling showing hidden files: codeCmd-Shift-./code  <comment42050> Does the folder name you created starts with a dot? <comment42051> @LoïcWolff No. The finder just show these **music**, **photo** etc <comment42053> seems works. But it's still different from I see in the shell. When i go to **/**, it just shows several directories and some are renamed to my language. <comment42055> @LoïcWolff Don't you mean CMD+SHIFT+G? <comment42056> Mac OS use a trick to translate some folder based on your language. Like the ones in your home folder. In `/`, they "flag" some folder to stay invisible. <comment42057> @gentmatt good catch, thank you. <comment42063> or type in "killall Finder" so you don't have to log out. <comment372355> Just an FWI... This does not work in all versions of OS X/macOS. I just tested it under OS X 10.8.5 and OS X 10.11.6 and it does not work. It did work in macOS 10.12.5.
