Using specific part of song in iMovie clip <body> This is driving me crazy I'm pretty tech savvy and I cannot figure out how to get say 1:20 to 1:33 on a rolling stones song for a 13 sec clip I took on my iPhone 6s. It will only let me use the first 13 sec. I've been clicking, dragging, zooming with the audio clip selected. I can't find the info online for doing this on the iPhone.  How do I select and use a portion of a song in iMovie on my iPhone?
