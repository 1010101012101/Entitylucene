Creating a new desktop on one monitor creates a desktop on all monitors <body> Additionally shifting my desktop on the one monitor I created (with 2 monitors plugged into my MacBook Pro) shifts every desktop. I don't want this feature how do I turn it off?  I just want to be able to create one desktop on one monitor and keep all the rest of my monitors desktops the same.  <answer183376> Try System Prefs  Mission Control  Displays have separate spaces.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PMrKB.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment218606> Also, I believe you have to log out or reboot for this change to take effect. <comment218607> ah, useful info. I admit I switched that off the first day the pref appeared on Mavericks[?] & will not touch it again - it really messed up my working method ;-)
