Transfer reminders from iCal to Google Calendar <body> I switched from iCloud to Google calendar. I already transferred all my calendars via export/import to Google Calendar. Now I'd like to transfer my reminders from iCal/iCloud to Google Calendar. How can I do this?  <answer36487> From what I understand, Reminders are not transferrable. Each service programs them differently and there is no way (other than copying/pasting text) to easily transfer them. Hope this helps.  <answer102138> This script will at least help with the export from Reminders:  precode#!/usr/bin/osascript  tell application "Reminders"     set todo_accounts to every account     -- accounts have lists. loop thru accounts to get their lists.     repeat with i from 1 to length of todo_accounts         tell account i             set todo_lists to get every list             -- lists have reminders. loop thru lists to get their reminders             repeat with j from 1 to length of todo_lists                 tell list j                     set todos to (get reminders)                     -- if there are no reminders for a list, then ignore the list                     if length of todos is greater than 0 then                         -- Write out the name of the list                         do shell script "echo " &amp; (quoted form of (get name)) &amp; " &gt;&gt; ~/Desktop/todos.txt"                         -- loop thru the reminders to get properties                         repeat with k from 1 to length of todos                             set this_todo to item k of todos                             if (this_todo is not completed) then                                 do shell script "echo [  ] " &amp; (quoted form of (get name of this_todo)) &amp; " &gt;&gt; ~/Desktop/todos.txt"                             end if                         end repeat                     end if                 end tell             end repeat         end tell     end repeat end tell /code/pre  <comment41669> I hope you are wrong but after doing some more research I guess you are unfortunately right. <comment120301> Paste that into Apple Script and run
