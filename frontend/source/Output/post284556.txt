Can I run a terminal on IOS with sandboxed filesystem (w/o jailbreak)? <body> Can I run a terminal app on IOS with a sandboxed filesystem (no jailbreak).  E.g. is there an app that allows me to locally install linux on an IOS device (without jailbreak)?  More precisely: I am not looking for an ssh client, but for a way to install locally on IOS e.g. something like homebrew, e.g. to use arbitrary programming languages or emacs or vim or latex or clojure or haskell or etc ;)  So, it would be totally fine, if such an app has its own unix-style file system and only commandline, i.e. no GUI.  <comment358861> I don't think that a sandboxed app that does what you asked for exists, and I think no one would spend their time making it. what you can do though is make your own app (an app that connects to a server and runs your commands or something like that)
