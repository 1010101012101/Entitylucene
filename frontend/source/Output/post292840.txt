Load MacBook Air back-up on MacBook 2017 <body> I've recently purchased a MacBook 12' 2017 and would like to restore it with a TimeMachine back-up of my previous MacBook Air 13' 2014. When I try to do that from the recovery mode, an error message says something about the two models not being compatible. I wonder if this is indeed the case and if there is a workaround.   <answer292841> Don't restore as a backup, use Migration Assistant during initial setup at first boot.  If you set the machine up first &amp; try to Migrate later, you'll end up with two users &amp; then have to try merging them manually, which is not a lot of fun.
