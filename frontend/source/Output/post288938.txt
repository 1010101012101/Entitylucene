MacBook Air (sometimes) does not wake up <body> I have a 2015 MacBook Air. It's still in warranty. Around 45 days ago, I put my Mac on sleep and when I tried waking it up, it wouldn't wake up. I tried many things including long-press-power-button and resetting the SMC but nothing worked. I contacted Apple Support on Twitter and after some basic troubleshooting, they asked me to take my MacBook to an Apple Service Centre. But then in 4-5 hours, it automagically started working.   It worked great until yesterday when it again failed to start in the morning after I had put it on sleep at night. Same problem except this time, it did turn on after 4-5 hours (after resetting the SMC) and after booting up, when I entered my password, it abruptly shut down again.  After resetting the SMC once more, it worked and has been working since. But now whenever I put in sleep for longer period of time, it stops working. And I have to reset the SMC again.  What should I do? Any tips that I should try before going to Apple Service Centre?
