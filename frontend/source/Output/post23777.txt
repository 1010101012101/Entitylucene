Lion kills application behind the scene, how to put application on a do not kill list? <body> I am encountering an irritating feature of Lion.  Say I spend 30 minutes in XCode, then I go to iChat to talk to my girlfriend for 5 minutes, then I switch to Safari to check StackExchange, gmail, and whatever else I might want to check.  Then I switch to Safari where I run another set of pages. For 5 or 10 seconds, the app resumes with beachball. This is annoying as hell (switch appnames around, they behave the same).   How can I prevent this from happening at all (unlikely) or at least mitigate it by making a list of apps that are not allowed to go into silently-killed mode?  <answer23784> You can't. Check out this thread on the Apple discussion forum. You can also read this article from TUAW.  <comment26568> I must say, this sucks hard. I've been pushing many people to Apple because I believe it's a more productive environment, but killing apps is very annoying, and "but it's fast enough that you won't feel it" is not true: people notice it... and post here ;) <comment26569> @Kheldar I haven't actually updated to Lion yet, but I have done some "research" (reading posts here) and have found things like what you have posted about. I am a superuser on my computer and I like to be able to control _*everything*_. :-) Lion has several things that you can't turn off. <comment26580> One thing I have noticed about this "feature" is that it boosts the incentives to have an SSD application drive. It used to be "how often are you really launching applications?" was a valid counter-argument to the fast launching of an SSD. Now the answer is "all the damned time". <comment107001> [Is there a way to disable OS X auto termination of applications?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/48780/8546) (2012-04-16)
