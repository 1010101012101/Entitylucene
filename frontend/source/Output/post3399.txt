Rotated PDF Doesn't Save State? <body> For some strange reason, when I rotate a PDF using the trackpad (Two finger multi-touch rotation gesture.), there's no option to save it and all changes are lost after I close it.  (The save button is grayed out.)  What am I doing wrong?  <answer3400> ... Never mind. Apparently rotating using the trackpad of a PDF in Preview is just for cosmetic purposes. You have to rotate using +L or +R or within the Apple-bar menu. Only after that, the save option will be available. :|   Strange.  <answer3422> Like you said, using kbd/kbd+ kbdL/kbd and kbd/kbd+kbdR/kbd seems to modify the PDF in place.     But if you use the rotation gesture on the trackpad, and use codeSave As/code, it will save the PDF with the pages rotated.  <comment3090> that is certainly strange... glad you figured it out and posted the answer so others won't have to get frustrated if they encounter this issue :P
