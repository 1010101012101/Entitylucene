iPhone: why is the Add Call button disabled for 15 seconds? <body> When I make a phone call, the add call button is disabled for 15 seconds... I.e. it's grayed out. Then it becomes active and works as I expect. But how I can set up conference calls without this delay every time?  <answer68507> You can only make a second call once the first call is connected. That delay is to connect and set up the first call.  <comment79420> @Gerry is that relevant?  The upvotes give much more reputation than the accepts... <comment79423> @Thorbj√∏rnRavnAndersen, yes it is relevant. It's part of how these sites work, and reviewing his questions there are plenty that have acceptable answers.
