Hard Drive Space Discrepancy? <body> Anyone know why there would be a difference between the number shown at the bottom of the hard drive icon and the number of available space in '7.6 GB free of 272.42 GB' in the screenshot below?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zLfsD.png" alt="discrepancy"  <answer163348> Maybe: "750 GB SATA Disk" has one partition called "Macintosh HD" of that smaller size?  Consult Disk Utility, "Partition" for that drive...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yovqe.jpg" alt="partitioned"
