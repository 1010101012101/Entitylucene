Prevent email being sent to certain addresses <body> In mail.app, is there a way to prevent or warn when sending email to specific addresses?  My use case; I would like to blacklist company wide distribution addresses so that if I hit "reply all" one of these types of actions could occur:  ul liThe specified addresses will be silently removed/li liI will be prevented from sending the email until it is manually removed/li liI will be prompted with an "are you sure?" message/li liPrompted to keep or remove the blacklisted email address/li /ul  I've looked around and can't find anything that would do this, any suggestions are appreciated.  (Ps, I also cross-posted here: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7381528)  <comment265987> you can make a mail rule (which would listen for messages that fit certain criteria) that triggers an applescript that creates an outgoing message (but doesn't necessarily send it). If you're willing to go that route, i'm pretty sure you can systematically remove certain items from the list of recipients. let me know if you need help (if thats even something youd want to do).
