Find my iPhone app won't install on iPhone 6s <body> The "Find my iPhone" app won't install on my iPhone 6s. I tried several times directly from the App Store and I am unsuccessful  <answer250326> I'm using iOS 10 Developer Beta 7. Find my iPhone is already installed. Just out of curiosity, I went to the App Store, and did a search for the app. Interestingly, the little "cloud" icon would seem to indicate that, although I have downloaded it in the past, it is NOT installed. This is not actually the case - it IS installed.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/h4CAR.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Try going to your main page and swiping down - this will enable the search feature. Then search for "Find iPhone." Just in case it's hidden in a folder, this will tell you if it is already installed.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1FaQI.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment310771> Welcome to Ask Different.
