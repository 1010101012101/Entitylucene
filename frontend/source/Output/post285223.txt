Delete iCloud photos after saving them to external hard drive <body> I transferred all photos from my laptop to an external hard drive. Can I  now delete all iCloud photos from my laptop and will they still remain on my external hard drive?  <comment359659> Are the photos on your external HD inside or outside a Photo Library?
