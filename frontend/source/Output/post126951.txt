outlook.com calendar and contacts sync <body> I recently started using a mac, and my mind was blown by the fact that I can't sync my live.com calendar with the default calendar app (same goes for contacts). I don't understand why this is the case since I can do these things on the iPhone...  I'd like to either,   ol liFind a way to sync my calendar with the NATIVE apple apps (that doesn't involve first sharing the calendar with a gmail, then importing the gmail in to iCal (that's a stone age solution.))/li /ol  or  ol liFind a tool that works with ALL of the following (because I have 2 mail, cal, and contact accounts).  ï»¿ ul liIMAP/li liCALDAV/li liCARDDAV/li liEAS settings for hotmail/li /ul/li /ol  <comment148700> In moving from stone age to bronze age is making the live.com work in IMAP mode. <comment148706> I agree. That was a big step. It only took MS 30 years to make that leap. <comment165885> Apple is going to FAIL so badly when lack of ActiveSync on Mac OS breaks down the much touted 'continuity' feature across iOS and Mac OS.
