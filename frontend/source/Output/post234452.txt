Can't dismiss Twitter for Web's popups in Mobile Safari in iOS 8 <body> I tend to read Twitter from the Web, using Mobile Safari in iOS 8 (for Iphone). A few weeks ago, I stopped being able to dismiss the popups (cookies warning, "Open this on the Twitter app", etc.) that appear on the page. What I mean is this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sgLpL.png" width="288"  I hit the "Cerrar" ("Close") button and nothing happens, and yet, if I hit that "Politica de cookies" link, it will open it, so the popup is clearly being "detected". The same if I hit the "X" in the "Abrir en la aplicaci√≥n" line above: nothing happens.  Can anyone with iOS 9 confirm if this happens too? Or in other words: is this something to do with me using iOS 8, or it's all on Twitter's end?  <comment287934> Okay, as of today, it seems to be fixed.
