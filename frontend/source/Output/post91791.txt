Favorites disappears from sidebar in Finder <body> Running Mountain Lion 10.8.3 I find that after a recent reboot my Favorites have all disappeared from the sidebar in Finder.  Finder  Preferences  Sidebar shows a number of boxes against Favorite folders, but these can not be selected  <answer120626> Hold together kbdOption/kbd+kbdCommand/kbd+kbdesc/kbd and then relaunch "Finder" that will solve your problem instantly.  If the problem persists, please try reinstall Mac OS X by kbdCommand/kbd+kbdR/kbd after rebooting.  <answer143864> Try simply hovering over the heading "Favorites" in the sidebar and then on the word "Show" which appears to the right  This toggles the favorites on and off...  <answer212766> I had same problem on Yosemite. Hovering over "Favorites" and clicking "Show" worked.  <comment107839> Try deleting the preferences with `rm ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Finder.plist; killall Finder`. Does Console.app show any relevant log messages? <comment223592> I had the same problem, I can't believe I didn't realise they're hidden *facepalm*. Thanks XD <comment259940> This plus a restart solved. Thanks
