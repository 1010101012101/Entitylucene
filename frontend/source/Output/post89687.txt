Keyboard shortcut within Mission Control for choosing a specific application window? <body> I use Mountain Lion and want to know if there are keyboard shortcuts for moving around and choosing a particular application window strongwithin/strong a given active desktop in Mission Control.  I chose an option to show all active windows separately in Mission Control.  Can anyone help?  <comment115295> Related question at Super User: [How to make Mission Control keyboard friendly?](http://superuser.com/questions/313055/how-to-make-mission-control-keyboard-friendly) ... unfortunately, there doesn't yet appear to be a way to select a particular application using only the keyboard.
