Is a MacBook 12" dual monitor setup possible? <body> I would like to use dual/two monitors with my macbook 12" (2016).  Is the device feasible of connecting, for example, to two strongLG UltraFine 4K Display/strong monitors? What kind of cables/connectors do I need?  <answer276675> As per https://support.apple.com/kb/SP712?viewlocale=en_US, I regret to inform you of this:     h2strongGraphics and Video Support/strong/h2      strongIntel HD Graphics 5300/strong      Dual display and video mirroring: Simultaneously supports full native resolution on the built-in display and up to 3840 by 2160 pixels on an external display, both at millions of colors      h2strongDisplay/strong/h2      strongRetina display/strong      12-inch (diagonal) LED-backlit display with IPS technology   2304-by-1440 resolution at 226 pixels per inch with support for   millions of colors 16:10 aspect ratio Supported scaled resolutions:      ul   li1440 by 900 /li   li1280 by 800 /li   li1024 by 640/li   /ul   <comment348255> For the 2015 model, there is a video on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GY2vZOJETl4 <comment348274> I am almost positive the MacBook is only capable of driving a single 4K monitor (and only at 30Hz - see here: http://9to5mac.com/2016/06/04/how-to-enable-4k-60hz-resolution-2016-macbook/).
