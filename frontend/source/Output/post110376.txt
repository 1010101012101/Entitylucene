iPhone 5 changes itself to a black theme with white and blue writing <body> My iPhone 5 keeps changing itself to a black theme with white and blue fonts but then defaults back to white. I want the black them but have no idea where that is and how to turn on as the phone just does it itself.   It's the whole OS. Not safari. I have have screen shots of my contact list, missed calls and a full contact.  img src="https://i.imgur.com/Aboofqf.jpg" alt=""  img src="https://i.imgur.com/UgO8c54.jpg" alt=""  <answer110390> This would be explained entirely by a change to your accessibility settings to "Invert Colors".  You can change that back in Settings-General-Accessibility.   <comment130040> Could you maybe take a screenshot (by pressing the home and power button at the same time) and post it here? This might help us understand what's going on. <comment130076> Once you have screen shots, you can upload them to http://imgur.com and edit the links into your question. <comment130096> http://imgur.com/Aboofqf http://imgur.com/UgO8c54 Here are a few extra screen shots. <comment130101> Is this for the whole OS or safari? if it's just safari, it's black when you use private browsing and goes back when you revert to normal browsing.
