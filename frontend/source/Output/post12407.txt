How to get rid of the "Other..."-Account on the login screen? <body> Suddenly my MBP shows an "Other..."-Account on the login screen. I searched for a solution to get rid of it and found a couple of answers that say I have somehow activated/enabled the root user. All I did was using a couple of trivial sudo-commands at the command-line, but nothing experimental or which I am unfamiliar with...  The suggested solutions said I need to deactivate the root user in the Directory Utilities but it was not activated.   Are there any other solutions to get rid of this "Other..."-Account?  <answer12421> Have you tried the codesudo /usr/bin/defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow SHOWOTHERUSERS_MANAGED -bool false/code in the terminal? This turns off showing some of the other user types.  Doing some additional research, it looks like this has been somewhat addressed in this post on https://superuser.com/questions/70156/hide-users-from-mac-os-x-snow-leopard-logon-screen  <comment12985> Although I haven't tried the command in the terminal your link pointed me to the right direction. Thank you! I installed Zend Server CE that day which created a System-User causing this problem... <comment12986> Awesome, glad to help. <comment127095> It perfectly worked on Mavericks.
