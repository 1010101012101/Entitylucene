Hide dock bar permanently <body> Is it possible to hide dock bar permanently? I know we can make dock bar hide/appear automatically. But I don't want dock bar to appear even when the arrow moves on it.  <answer154707> You can try hiding it and then setting a long delay before it appears. Something like: codedefaults write com.apple.Dock autohide-delay -float 10000 &amp;&amp; killall Dock/code
