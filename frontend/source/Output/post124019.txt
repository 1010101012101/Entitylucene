Run Emacs within Bash <body> I am looking for a way in Bash to run something within Emacs. For example, if you run emacs, press kbdesc/kbd+kbdX/kbd then type "life," you get a little simulation of Conway's Game of Life. How could this be done via Bash?  Don't have much so far:  precode#!/bin/sh emacs /code/pre  I've read about using code^]/code and such but doing  precode#!/bin/sh emacs ^] /code/pre  does not work (neither does code^[/code)  Basically, how can I simulate all of these key presses in Bash, with the default Mac Emacs (22.1.1)?  <answer124021> Use codeemacs -f &lt;function&gt;/code  E.g.: codeemacs -f life/code in this case.  GNU Emacs Manual  <comment144901> I bet there is a command line argument you could pass to emacs to get it to fire up the life simulation. Is that basically what you want - to go directly from bash to the life simulation with no additional key presses? <comment144903> @bmike Exactly.
