How to open new Finder window in current space quickly? <body> When I create a new Desktop (space) in Mission Control, how can I quickly open a new Finder window in that space?  Right now I have to right-click on the Finder icon and hit codeNew Finder Window/code, because if I left-click on the icon it brings me to the already open windows in another space. I do want to keep this behaviour for when a Finder window already exists in the current space. I can then switch back and forth by clicking on the icon.  However, in a space where no Finder window is present, ideally I would click on the Finder icon and a new window would appear. kbdShift/kbd clicking is also fine. Can I achieve this behaviour somehow?  <answer110733> Just click on the blank desktop space to activate the Finder  and then kbdCMD/kbd+kbdn/kbd  -EDIT.  Or  Save this Applescript code as an Applescript Application.  Drag it to you dock next to your finder iCon and click it when you want a new finder window.  precodetell application "Finder"     activate     make new Finder window end tell /code/pre  <answer110766> If opening a new finder window with Command/Apple + n doesn't work, ensure you don't have the Option "Open On ... Space" set for the Finder.  <comment131595> This assumes that I have blank desktop space. If I'm in another app, I first have to show the desktop, then click on it and then hit cmd+n. I was hoping for a faster solution. <comment131615> updated the answer <comment219012> cmd + n works for me, but I could not find the option you mentioned in the settings.
