NTFS Disk "failed to mount" <body> I have an iMac running El Capitan, and an external disk formatted NTFS that will not mount on the mac.  It will mount perfectly in Windows and Ubuntu.  I'm not trying to write to it, right now I just want to read.  Here's my output of "diskutil mount disk3s1":  precodeVolume on disk3s1 failed to mount If the volume is damaged, try the "readOnly" option /code/pre  Output of info:  precodeDevice Identifier:        disk3s1 Device Node:              /dev/disk3s1 Whole:                    No Part of Whole:            disk3 Device / Media Name:      Untitled 1  Volume Name:                Mounted:                  No  File System Personality:  NTFS Type (Bundle):            ntfs Name (User Visible):      Windows NT File System (NTFS)  Partition Type:           Windows_NTFS OS Can Be Installed:      No Media Type:               Generic Protocol:                 USB SMART Status:             Not Supported Volume UUID:              E6F4FA18-C794-465E-82A1-91A8F45C4262  Total Size:               320.0 GB (319965626368 Bytes)  (exactly 624932864 512-Byte-Units) Volume Free Space:        0 B (0 Bytes) (exactly 0 512-Byte-Units) Device Block Size:        512 Bytes  Read-Only Media:          No Read-Only Volume:         Not applicable (not mounted)  Device Location:          External Removable Media:          No /code/pre  Any ideas would be appreciated.  <answer280516> In some cases, when an external drive works on Windows but doesn't on Mac OS, it's because you didn't eject it properly. All you need to do is connect it to a Windows OS, and eject it properly (through the devices icon near the Windows clock).  For more information and screenshots for these instructions, look into this article which was the source for how I fixed a similar problem.  <comment268152> Since you're using NTFS I'll assume you have a Windows system that you can attach the external drives to and run `chkdsk /f drive letter:` on from an Administrator Command Prompt, e.g., `chkdsk /f e:` and then try mounting again under OS X. This will ensure there are no issue with the filesystem, which under some circumstances may cause it not to mount properly. <comment268180> I've done that, and encountered the same problem. <comment268184> Are you running the newest version of OS X? <comment269143> I'm running, 10.11.1
