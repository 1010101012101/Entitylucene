g5 ppc osx 10.5.8 i can't change administrator password <body> I have a problem with my G5 PPC with OS X 10.5.8. I bought this Mac from an English friend of mine. He forgot an administrator password. I don't have the system CD or Internet connection.  I tried to follow your instructions in other post (command+s) but this is what happens when I do that (on the Mac).  I wrote the command like post and i tried to write in different mode. If you look the last row the command was not found or nothing found to load.  Now i have a new problem. following your instruction this is the results !  i hope you can help me please step by step ... because i'am desperate  Excuse me for my english img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9e82q.jpg" alt="problem"  <answer205277> From the screenshot, I see that you've already gotten to "Single User Mode". (Command-S at power on should get you there unless there is an Open Firmware password - in which case you'd need to clear that by changing the installed RAM).  After mounting the filesystem:  precodemount -uw /code/pre  You can change the password of a user:  precodepasswd username /code/pre  If you don't know the username, list the user home folders:  precodels -l /Users/ /code/pre  <comment182179> root is disabled by default on Macs. You'd need to know an admin account & password, other than root. The last owner's name & pass, if they didn't erase all the accounts. Can you post a link to the other question you are referring to, too.
