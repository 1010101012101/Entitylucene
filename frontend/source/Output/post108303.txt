Command+C (copy) with the left command key does not work <body> I'm facing a strange problem. When I type kbd⌘/kbd+kbdC/kbd with the left command key, it does not work anymore. The left command key is working for kbd⌘/kbd+kbdV/kbd or kbd⌘/kbd+kbdX/kbd or any others so it's not a hardware problem.  The kbdC/kbd key is working too. The right command key is working for kbd⌘/kbd+kbdC/kbd.  I tried changing keyboard language, adding a shortcut, reset NVRAM, activated/deactivated VoiceOver (tip found on a site) to no avail. I'm on a MacBook Pro with Mavericks.  <answer110051> What has worked for me was force-quitting Finder (basically after trying all what you have suggested yourselves).  <answer110944> It was a weird experience for me, had the same problem. After long unfruitful research through internet, I took MBP to the Genius Bar. Even they tried with networked operating systems like 10.9, 10.8 and others too. Nothing worked, later after long technical discussion they decided it may be an hardware issue (due to shorting, also option button was not working during startup OS switching). After top keyboard cover replacement it worked! Again something unexplainable, yet worked!  <answer112847> Thank you for your insights! after clearing the cache, resetting PRAM, repairing disc and permission, nothing.  Then it worked for a few minutes. Finally, I decided to use Keyremap4macbook and assigned the fn key to work like left command. It works, so I leave it like that.

Then release everything. To restart your computer, just press on the power button again.  It doesn't damage anything and even got back on the internet pages I was on.  <answer171861> You might have a wrong keyboard layout set up on your system, i.e. Dvorak keyboard layout. If you switch to the proper layout you might fix the problem.  Go to System Preferences - Keyboard - Input Sources. Then click on "+" and add the keyboard layout of your preference.   Note: Dvorak users should know that there are a few types of the keyboard: Dvorak, Dvorak - Left, Dvorak - Right, Dvorak - Qwerty. Each of those acts differently when combination "Command + C" is pressed.  <answer178070> I had the same problem, but after one copy command (kbdcmd/kbd + kbdc/kbd) with the right command key, the left command key started working again!  <answer190395> Make sure when you press kbdCMD/kbd+kbdC/kbd your codeEdit/code menu in the top flashes, this indicates it works as expected.  If it doesn't, go to emKeyboard/em settings in emSystem Preferences/em and:  ul liRestore defaults emModifier Keys.../em,/li liRestore defaults in emShortcuts/em tab,/li liIn emApp Shortcuts/em click the em+/em button and test if Keyboard Shortcut input box will react on your combination./li /ul  If codeEdit/code menu flashes and it still doesn't work, then the first thing to do is to restart pasteboard service by the following commands:  precodelaunchctl stop com.apple.pboard launchctl start com.apple.pboard /code/pre  If still doesn't work, here are some other suggestions to troubleshoot the problem:  ul liRe-test in different applications just in case./li liRe-test if works when using contextual menu (without using the shortcut)./li liRe-test alternative combination such as kbdCMD/kbd+kbdX/kbd for emCut/em instead. /li liRun emConsole/em to see your emSystem log queries/em if something obvious is happening./li liTest if the Clipboard works from the terminal via:  precode$ echo test | pbcopy $ pbpaste /code/pre  If emPaste/em menu item is no more greyed out, then maybe it's a problem with emPaste/em command.  If you're advanced user, use codedtruss/code or codefs_usage/code to debug it, for instance:  precode$ sudo fs_usage | grep -C4 MyAppWhereCopyDoesntWork /code/pre  and then notice other apps which appearing exactly when you press the shortcut which potentially you could consider to quit for testing purposes./li liDisable any recent programs that you run or restart your computer./li liDisable emVoiceOver/em as suggested here./li liForce quit the emFinder/em (e.g.: codekillall -HUP Finder/code)./li liIf still doesn't work, consider rebooting system, especially in Recovery or Safe mode to re-test./li /ul  As for workaround, you can always install Karabiner app and remap your shortcuts by configuring codeprivate.xml/code file (see emMisc/em tab). For more suggestion, please check the following posts:  ul liRemap Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V, and Ctrl-X only/li liHow can I reassign the copy/paste keyboard shortcuts?/li /ul  <answer223802> In my case, it was because "Command+C" in strongInput Sources/strong conflicted with "Command+C" of Copy command.  I went "System Preferences - Keyboard - Shortcuts - Input Sources", and found "Select the previous input source" item, then changed it to "Control+C". Then the "Command+C" Copy command worked.  <answer284159> I had the same issue and went into System PreferencesShortcutsKeyboard and deselected everything. I was having issues with cmd-z, cmd-x, cmd-v, and deselecting all of these (I didn't use them anyway) allowed all of these to work again.   <answer292703> One of your applications may utilize the cmd+c shortcut, which is not shown in system preferences.   I have GoldenDict installed and one of its hotkeys to "Use the following hotkey to translate a word from clipboard" is "cmd+c c", which brings this problem.   strongSolution: use another hotkey or disable it./strong  <comment126998> Is this in only one app, or all apps? <comment127114> It's on all apps. I created a new user, same problem. <comment147873> what does "Move focus to next window" have to do with this question? <comment200526> Legend!! I was having a similar problem. Couldn't use Cmd + 1 . just wouldn't work on anything but I only used it the other day, followed your instructions and deselected "Move focus to next window" TADA!!! fixed! thankyou. don't know why you were down voted. Just because it didn't work for you, don't down vote a correct answer. Thanks mate <comment207972> Same problem here on OS X 10.10.2 with an external wired apple keyboard. <comment210845> This does not really answer the question. If you have a different question, you can ask it by clicking [Ask Question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/ask). You can also [add a bounty](http://apple.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/set-bounties) to draw more attention to this question once you have enough [reputation](http://apple.stackexchange.com/help/whats-reputation). <comment224768> It shall be not a real answer but it is still a solution for The problem, Master. <comment249085> I have the exact same problem. What do you mean by replacing the keyboard cover? Do you mean the plastic keys? <comment258933> Adding in the combinations manually worked for all but `⌘` + `Z` for some reason. (Yes I am aware there is more to the answer I haven't tried yet; I just thought it was strange.) <comment260211> Force quitting Finder made `⌘` + `C` stop working on the right too. But not any other commands strangely enough. <comment328636> This solved my problem too! Strange things happen!
