How to redirect mail from a main inbox to only your smart mailbox? <body> I have an Apple Mail smart mailbox set up to filter out all of the messages that contain a certain string in the subject line.  Now, the problem is that there are A LOT of these messages and so they clutter up my main inbox. As it stands, I can simply see the messages in the smartbox, but they reside in the main inbox.   Is there anyway I can get these messages to move from my main inbox to the smartbox?  <answer100449> A smart mailbox is just a virtual mailbox showing mails which match certain rules. This means that you can't physicallye emmove/em mail into a smart mailbox.  In your case you could create a physical mailbox folder instead and use mail rules to move mail matching the subject string directly into this folder on arrival.  <answer100451> The short answer is no. Smart mailboxes are basically filters. All mail is still in the original mailbox. Or as Apple puts it:     A Smart Mailbox shows in one location messages that are stored in other mailboxes. For example, a Smart Mailbox might show all messages from a specific sender or with a certain type of attachment, regardless of the mailbox where theyâ€™re stored.   Source.   You could however create your own sort of smart mailboxes by using rules to move messages around based on certain characteristics. http://support.apple.com/kb/PH11738.  Example of rules creating a Today folder: img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2196281/Online/Apple%20Exhchange%20Today.png" alt="today"  img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2196281/Online/Apple%20Exhchange%20Older.png" alt="older"  This moves all mail from today to a folder called today. A day later it will move that mail to a folder called archive (archief in Dutch). This should give you an idea how to work with rules and folders.
