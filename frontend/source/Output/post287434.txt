Noise within plugged-in headphones to MacBook Air <body> When I have plugged in headphones and playing music on my MacBook Air I hear noise like buzzing and just a little sound of music.   I've tried cleaning the audio jack using a toothpick but this made no difference. I've also tried resetting the PRAM and SMC.  strongWhat else can I do to troubleshoot this?/strong  <comment362911> Does this happen with all pairs of headphones or just one? I have the same problem but subtler and only with only one specific pair of EarPods. <comment363014> yes with all pairs
