Does (or when will) the Google Chrome browser support speech recognition on the iPad? <body> I tried testing the Google Chrome browser's speech recognition on the iPad2. It does not show the little microphone (see the bottom of this test page)  It it simply not supported? Or only on iPad3 or certain O/S versions of the iPad?  <comment99054> Apple does not allow application to use the file system. I think this is one of the features they've disabled. <comment99112> I think probably only the people who make google chrome can tell you whether the iPad version of this app is supposed to work with that feature and whether a particular iPad version is required.
