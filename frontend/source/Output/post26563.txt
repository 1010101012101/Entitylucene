Is there a way to access my mac remotely by using browser only? <body> I want to be able to browse/search my files, send email... nothing fancy like watch the movie and so on?  <answer26564> Yes you can use logmein https://secure.logmein.com/  After installing and setting things up you will just need your browser wherever you are.  <answer27195> Yes, you need a remote access web-based application such as LogMeIn, Teamviewer or ScreenConnect.  You have to download the app on the host machine and should be able to connect in through the internet.    <comment30292> Brilliant! Works!
