How can I disable password for system preferences lock? How can I permanently unlock all system preferences? <body> Is there any way to disable the "Click the lock to make changes" needing a password, or is there a way to permanently unlock all settings in Mountain Lion?  More specifically I'm turning the Network Link Conditioner  ( to simulate slow connections ) on and off frequently from its system preferences pane and it needs a password each time and it's getting annoying.  I'm comfortable with the security issues this presents if I could revert to the default behavior at some point.   strongEdit/strong   I'd just like to point out that in the time it takes to think up a sarcastic reply to an answer ( embut ultimately not send because you're too polite/em ), the lock locks itself automatically.  <answer95050> The settings stay unlocked, just do not click the "lock". This will keep the stuff unlocked until you want to lock it again.  <comment111493> Thanks, is there any **other** way to keep it unlocked if the lock locks itself after a minute? <comment199219> This is clearly how it is designed (and it is a good design), but for many users like me, it does not work. The padlock is re-locked each time that System Preferences is reopened.
