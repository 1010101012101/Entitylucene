VMware Fusion 6: cannot start Windows 2000 VM that worked in VMware Fusion 4 <body> Got this message when starting a Windows 2000 VM on VMware Fusion 6 on a Retina MacBook Pro with OS X Mavericks:     This virtual machine's policies are too old to be run by this version of VMware Fusion.   Could only find this Danish question with no answers.  Fusion 6 is supposed to   ul lirun any old virtual hardware version (this one is virtual hardware 7, I think it originates from VMware Workstation 6.5)./li lisupport Windows 2000 Anyone having the faintest idea how to start digging for a cause?/li /ul  emEdit: extra information about the settings, .vmx and .vmxf files./em  Opening the codesettings/code for this VM gets the same message.  VMware Virtual Hardware version overview.  There are a few lines with the word codepolicy/code in the .vmx file, but none in the .vmfx file. And there is a .vmpl file (which seems to have to do with the -now discontinued- VMware ACE that used to ship with older VMware versions including VMware 6.5).  These are the lines with codepolicy/code in the .vmx file:  precodetools.upgrade.policy = "upgradeAtPowerCycle"  policy.vm.mvmtid = "52 3f 1e 13 9d 44 69 76-7c dd cc d1 67 a4 46 32" policy.vm.managedVMTemplate = "FALSE" policy.vm.managedVM = "FALSE" /code/pre  emNote/em:  This is not a VMware Fusion specific question, searching for "This virtual machine's policies are too old to be run by this version of VMware" (so without codeFusion/code or codeWorkstation/code) reveals some nice links including Starting a virtual machine in Workstation or Fusion fails with the error: This virtual machine's policies are too old to be run by this version of VMware (2034362) which also answers this question.  <answer117822> ol liOpen the virtual machine's configuration file code.vmx/code using a text editor./li liRemove the lines which starts with codepolicy.vm.*/code:  precodepolicy.vm.mvmtid = "52 d6 6f f9 f3 36 0f 9f-31 da 9f f5 90 7b ce 76" policy.vm.managedVMTemplate = "TRUE" policy.vm.managedVM = "FALSE" /code/pre/li liSave the file and close the text editor./li liRestart the VM./li /ol  hr  If you still encounter the errorâ€¦  ol liRename/delete the file with the extension code.vmpl/code/li liRestart the VM./li /ol  <comment137609> That's the thing: if I go to settings, I get the same message about policies. <comment137618> Ok - then try remove the three police.x lines from the .vmx file - also see this thread: https://communities.vmware.com/message/2099362 <comment137639> Can you reword your answer by including the .vmx changes mentioned in your comment? Then I'll do some comment cleanup.
