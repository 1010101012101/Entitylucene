How to fix specific problem on Mavericks 10.9.5? <body> I had a problem with Yosemite so I had to downgrade (Wi-Fi went off after 10 or so seconds of connecting to a network) to Mavericks, but now I don't have Wi-Fi at all-  ol liThe interface does not appear listed under System Preferences → Network./li liAfter I turn on the Interface name that should represent the Wi-Fi (en1) I can't turn on the Airport app via Terminal with the command…  precodesudo networksetup -setairportpower en1 /code/pre  I still get the message:     You cannot set Wi-Fi power because all Airport network are disabled.   If I use the option code-createnetworkservice AirPort en1/code I get the error     Unable to access the System Configuration database. /li liI already deleted everything in /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration//li liIt is weird but when I click the "+" Icon on the network services am interface named "Thunderbolt 1" appears, if I try to make a new service out of this Interface after I click the "Create" button no service is created./li liIf I run codesudo networksetup -listallhardwarereports/code I get Ethernet, Firewire, Thunderbolt1(en1), Thunderbolt Bridge (bridge0)./li liOn the system information app if I go to Wi-Fi some info is displayed./li /ol  I just don't really know what to do anymore.
