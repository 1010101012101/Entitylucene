How to delete one number off call list for iPhone 3GS <body> What app would I need to download and what are the steps to deleting one number at a time My iphone 3GS is already jailbroken.  <answer50008> If you're referring to the Phone  Recents listing the solution doesn't require a jailbroken phone. In the upper right corner is an codeEdit/code button. It will allow for the individual deletion of calls from this call log.  If this is not what you're after please provide some more detail for the question. Thanks.  <answer120994> there is no edit button by default..you need to install add-on like cydia. probably newer versions of OS have this edit button added, but i am not sure..
