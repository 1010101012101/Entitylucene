Sorting iPhone/iPad Apps based on usage? <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   Is there a way to sort the apps by usage frequncy?       Is there a way to have the Apps on my iPhone sorted based on usage frequency?  I found another thread, but it appeared to be focused on the MAC OS platform, not iOS.  In simple terms, I want the apps that I use all the time to be auto-sorted to the front.
