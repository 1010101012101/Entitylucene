Problem with iphone 4S- cannot delete photostream - no trash icon <body> I cannot delete the photo stream on my iphone 4S. There are 190items, but only 85photos-duplicated, and the HDR is disabled on the camera. I have looked at a few 'suggestions' but non of them seem to refer to my iphone4S. I have tried attaching it to my PC and opening ITunes, and clicking on the 'photos' in the iphone list - and can't get any further because no photos come up. People keep saying 'click on the photo and then the trash', but there is no trash icon for the photo stream. All I get when I open the photostream on the phone are two icons 'photos' and 'albums' - no trash icon. I can easily delete the ordinary photos, but not the photo stream - I'd get rid of it altogether if I knew how. It is a nuisance.
