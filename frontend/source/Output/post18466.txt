Keyboard shortcut for show window.(opposite function of Command-H) <body> If I press Command-H, an activated window disappear. How can I make it appear with shortcuts?  <answer18467> You can simply use the task switcher ( kbd⌘ cmd/kbd + kbd⇥ tab/kbd ) to bring the application back into focus and display it normally.  <answer18495> There is no shortcut to bring the window back, because the app loses focus when hidden. To bring its windows back, you have to give it focus again.  The easiest way to do this is with the kbdcmd/kbd+kbdtab/kbd shortcut. Press that, then leave kbdcmd/kbd held down. You'll see the App Switcher:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2Pj9n.png" alt="enter image description here"  From here, you can give focus to an app, as well as hide and show it without focusing.  strongTo focus an app and show it's windows:/strongbr Open the app switcher, then (while still holding down kbdcmd/kbd press kbdtab/kbd until the darkened box is over the app you want to focus.

While still holding down kbdcmd/kbd, press kbdh/kbd Then, release the keys.  If you want to 'hide' one window and don't want the app to lose focus, you can minimize the window. Do that by clicking the green button at its top right, or using Window- Mimize (kbdcmd/kbd+kbdm/kbd).br To restore a minimized window, click its name in the app's Window menu. Or, you can either click the window's icon in the right of your dock, or the app's Dock icon (depending on your settings).  <comment20295> That's great answer. Is there any shortcut to restore minimized window? <comment20298> @Sangdol Not as far as I know. It would be cool if there was one. <comment20306> Thanks for your answer. Is this `⇥` tab key? <comment20320> Yes it is. I'll edit my answer. <comment305717> Or more significantly, Command-Option-H, which hides all other windows. Using Cmd-Tab to restore them all one-by-one is pretty tedious but unfortunately there doesn't seem to be another answer.
