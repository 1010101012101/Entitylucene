Error Installing Jekyll on Mac <body> I'm trying to install Jekyll, a simple, blog-aware, static site generator.  When I attempted to run the terminal command codegem install jekyll/code, I got this error:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nKGm1.png" alt="Error installing Jekyll.  Failed to build gem native extensions."  I then tried to update my RubyGems, using the command codesudo gem update --system/code.  That didn't work.  Hopefully, I don't have to re-install Ruby.  What a headache that would be!  <answer133015> Following Seth Warburton's steps on Install Jekyll in OSX Mavericks, try adding codesudo/code to the install command:  precodesudo gem install jekyll /code/pre  If you need to update or re-install Ruby, consider using an isolated edition via brew.  <comment157684> Do you think installing Xcode will fix the problem?  I don't want to download it for nothing.  Additionally, I have extremely slow download speeds! <comment157704> What happens when you prefix `sudo` to the command? The error suggests a lack of write permissions; which should be fixed by using `sudo`.
