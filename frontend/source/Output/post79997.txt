Safari reader reads only one paragraph <body> How to enable Reader to read the next paragraph? Is it impossible to read the next one paragraph on the same web page with reader?  The sample page I'm trying to read http://www.magister.msk.ru/library/philos/shestov/shest03.htm It is in russian, but one can see that Safari Reader reads much less text than all page contains.  OSX 10.8.2, Safari 6.0.2 (8536.26.17)
