Getting text boxes to move with text <body> I have added a number of text boxes to an iWork Pages document. When I want to paste in additional text -- i.e. a methodology section at the beginning -- the text boxes do not move with the text, rather stay on the same page where they were inserted. How can I get them to move with the text?  <answer99101> Open the codeInspector/code and select the textbox whose behavior you want to alter. Go to the codeObject placement/code tab (third icon from left on the top icon row in the Inspector) and choose codeInline (moves with text)/code.
