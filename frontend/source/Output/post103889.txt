How to connect a client device in a wi-fi captive portal network? <body> I need to use a wifi client device (TPLink small device). This one has wifi client mode and ethernet port so that you can connect your PC ethernet connection to wifi client device and connect to internet.  How can we use such a device in a portal based network?  <comment122328> http://docs.fortinet.com/cb/html/index.html#page/FOS_Cookbook/Wireless/wireless-captive_portal.html and -or http://www.appliedtrust.com/resources/infrastructure/have-wireless-access-will-work-for-food
