Garage band doesn't get the "note off signal" when using the pedal on my keyboard. What can I do? <body> I'm connecting my nord stage piano via USB to my laptop for midi recording with garage band, but for some reason it doesn't get the "note off" signal when I use the pedal. The notes just keep ringing until the "naturally fade out". When looking at the written music in garage band I see that garage band recieves lots of "Ped." signals but no pedal-off-signals.   <comment83856> Garageband has been found to have very limited Pedal support. You are better off using Logic Pro if you want to use a pedal or add Ped. Off yourself or buy a new, compatible MIDI keyboard.
