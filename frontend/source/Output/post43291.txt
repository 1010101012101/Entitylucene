How to change path in Finder by entering the path manually? <body> It seems that by default there is no way to enter a whole path in the Finder, so instead one should traverse through all the tree to get somewhere deep in the filesystem. Is there anyway to overcome this problem? If there is no GUI for it in the Finder maybe launching it from the command line with the path? Something like:     $ finder /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/   <answer43292> Finder has a menu item found under Go ("Go to Folderâ€¦") where you can type a full path.  The kbdcommand/kbd+kbdshift/kbd+kbdG/kbd keyboard shortcut makes it handy to summon.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mrywa.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer43294> The command line version would be:  precodeopen -R /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/ /code/pre  or just:  precodeopen /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/ /code/pre  depending on you want to go inside the folder or reveal the folder in finder.  <comment286461> Is there a way to click on the path in finder and insert the path string right there, as in Windows Explorer? <comment286506> I'm not sure I follow what Finder would do to insert a string when you are clicking on an object. Perhaps opening a new question linking here for context might let you diagram the circumstances as you use them in Windows or the desired outcome in Finder, @Meglio
