Can't remove ACE from directory <body> My applications folder has an ACE entry which prevents me from deleting its contents (not even as root, with sip disabled). My problem is, that the command  codesudo chmod -N /Applications/code  tells me, that I have no permission to do this. I couldn't believe it and tried it in both single user and recovery mode, to no avail.  Output of codels -leO/code:  precodedrwxrwxr-x+ 148 root    admin  uappnd,nodump,opaque  4.9K Jul 31 08:55 Applications/ 0: group:everyone deny delete /code/pre  Is there any other possibility to fix this except from reinstalling the OS?  <answer293594> The proper command to remove the ACE from the folder in SIP-disabled mode is:  precodesudo chmod -a "everyone deny delete" /Applications /code/pre  You can also remove (or add) ACL entries by number/index:  precodesudo chmod -a# 0 /Applications /code/pre  <comment370450> Yes, and the one I provided just removes all. My problem is not the command, but rather that I cant run it because of permission problems (ironically). <comment370453> @redxef While you're sorting things out `sudo -s` might be easier to be sure you're root in the shell. Also - what does `ls -leO /` with the capital O show and `spctl --status`? You might need to add those to the body of your question or ask a follow on question - the answer above works to remove ACL for me. <comment370454> You're probably removing the wrong ACL - the /Applications one prevents you from deleting the entire directory - shouldn't you be looking at an ACL on a folder inside Applications? <comment370455> @redxef BTW for me your command works properly even after adding arbitrary additional ACEs (in ElCap though) <comment370460> The contents of the folder are, as far as I can tell not the culprit, they just have 777, 755, etc. with no ACL. <comment370461> `spctl --status` returned `enabled`, I disabled it with `--master-disable`, which still doesn't solve the problem. I added the output of `ls -leO`, as you suggested.
