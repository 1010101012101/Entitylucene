Hidden app in Apple App Store <body> I have an app that (depending on the user) needs to download a companion app.  I'd like to have this companion app in the app store so that the user can easily download it but I don't want the companion app public to everyone, I just want to be able to access it through a download command in my primary app.  Is such a thing feasible?  <answer190710> Not really. The only thing you could do is not providing any search tags, which would make it very hard for users to find it, or create an enterprise in-house-distribution system (which probably is not what you want).  ul lihttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/1763210/can-i-hide-or-make-my-iphone-application-unsearchable-on-the-app-store/li lihttps://developer.apple.com/enterprise//li /ul
