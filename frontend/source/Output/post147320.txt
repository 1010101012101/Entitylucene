Restore MacBook after Avast! install (stuck at apple logo) <body> Somebody installed Avast! on this MacBook running OSX 10.8 (that's what codeuname/code said) and now it won't boot, it gets stuck at the apple logo and nothing more, I was able to boot into single-user mode and made a backup. I have already run Avast!'s uninstall script at:  precode/Library/Application Support/Avast/components/uninstall/com.avast.uninstall.app/Contents/MacOS/uninstall.sh /code/pre  But it didn't solve anything.  How can I restore my MacBook? How can I make it boot normally? I am a complete noob using Apple products.  <answer158183> Try this link:  https://forum.avast.com/index.php?topic=151393.15  part way down the first page of the thread, the poster Francisco Velasco had a solution that worked for me (his is reply #9 August 17, 2014).

Usually it's inside dmg file with Avast. Launch it and it should completely uninstall Avast.  strongMethod #2/strong Uninstall Avast as usual.

Also, did you append `sudo sh` to that path in single user mode? It's required in order to properly run it (you need to invoke the `sh` shell, logging in as root before running that script). <comment173712> Yes, I executed that as root, and I don't know how to boot into safe mode <comment173713> I just tried it without luck. My MacBook still freezes at the apple logo with the loading animation. <comment185982> It's always best to add a transcription, or at least a précis of any linked content, as links can disappear over time, leaving the answer less useful to future readers. I've added the content for you :) <comment186017> Thank you, I also tried that solution, but unfortunately the regular uninstall method didn't work. In the end, I had to reinstall the disc image again, than you!
