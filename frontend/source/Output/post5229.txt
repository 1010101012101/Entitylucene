Mystery Box in Expose (or what I think is expose) <body> For some reason I have a mystery box when I go to expose (or w/e f3 is).  It'll show my other open apps, but once space will be transparent until I mouseover it.  It isn't horrible, but annoying so any help would be great.  Thanks  <answer5230> strikeI think I had that problem and I believe strongFirefox/strong was the culprit.  ul liTry to reproduce this bug with only Firefox open./li liTry to temporarily switch to Safari or Chrome and see if it still happens. And while you're there, never switch back to Firefox since those two are so much better ;) /strike/li /ul  Can you list your open apps next time it happens? And the times after too. You can also list the menubar app.  <answer5237> Some websites create a temporary invisible window using Javascript that they can use as a timer or something else that can be referenced globally from any page on their site. It's an old technique and usually, because the "window" has no profile, it cannot be detected (no taskbar item on Windows) except by expos√© which shows all windows.   There really isn't a way to stop it except restart your browser and not navigate to that site again.  <answer5260> If it's not the web browser, and you're sure you've quitted it (I'm sure you know on a Mac closing the window doesn't usually quit the application), then try this when you see another floating window:  ol liSearch Spotlight for codeActivity Monitor/code/li liChange the drop down menu to codeActive Processes/code or if not available choose codeMy Processes/code/li liSort by codeReal Memory Usage/code/li liFilePrint the list and post it somewhere where we can see it/li /ol  That will tell you every application and active daemon that is running actively so that we can check if anything is out of the ordinary.   <comment5317> what version of Mac OS X are you running? what programs are running? <comment5318> 10.6.5 is the version <comment5323> Invisible windows in JavaScript? Never heard of that. <comment5355> I don't use firefox, only Chrome. <comment5356> This is an issue w/o a browser open. <comment5362> Do you use fluid.app? I've had strange expose-windows with that. <comment5368> It is a thing, I programmed one for a website about three years ago but I forgot completely how to do it because of how archaic it is. I run into these on a regular basis, too with various online banking applications so please don't strikethrough my entire post until you've investigated the issue. <comment5369> That's good, a man after my own heart. Chrome FTW! <comment5387> Wow, sorry, I thought I edited my own post. I rollbacked everything. Really sorry. <comment14153> Please provide proof (via a link w/ instructions or something). I've been working with JavaScript for a long time and have never come across any sort of "invisible window". I'm very skeptical.
