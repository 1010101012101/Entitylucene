How to restore a hidden file in Time Machine? <body> I accidentally deleted my code~/.zshrc/code file and I'd like to get it back from a Time Machine backup. When I enter Time Machine I can see my home directory, but all the dot-files in the directory are hidden in the Finder window displayed by Time Machine.  How can I restore a hidden file like code~/.zshrc/code using Time Machine?  <answer141322> Rest assured that Time Machine is backing up your dot-files! You just can't see them by default in Finder. In order to restore a hidden file like code.zshrc/code you first need to turn off file hiding in finder. You can do this by opening a Terminal window and entering:  precodedefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE killall Finder /code/pre  Now enter Time Machine and navigate to where your hidden files resided. You should be able to restore them from there.  When you've restored all the files you want you can go back to having Finder hide them by entering:  precodedefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles FALSE killall Finder /code/pre  in a Terminal window.  <answer152452> You can easily access to your hidden file by using the Terminal.  precodecd /Volumes/TIME_CAPSULE_DISK_NAME/Backups.backupdb/YOUR_BACKUP/Users/YOUR_NAME ls -la /code/pre  <answer162842> strongTo be able to view invisible filesâ€¦/strong  Open Applescript Editor, in Applications  Utilities then copy/paste this to a new script...  emSince El Capitan the trick of changing view no longer works, so it's back to quitting the Finder/em  emFor a method to make this into a Service with key command see/embr https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/258741/85275  precodeset newHiddenVisiblesState to "YES" try     set oldHiddenVisiblesState to do shell script "defaults read com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles"     if oldHiddenVisiblesState is in {"1", "YES"} then         set newHiddenVisiblesState to "NO"     end if end try do shell script "defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles " &amp; newHiddenVisiblesState do shell script "killall Finder" return input /code/pre  Mavericks/Yosemite ought to work with this view refresh version, which was faster &amp; smoother, but it just stopped working at El Capitan...  precodeset newHiddenVisiblesState to "YES" try     set oldHiddenVisiblesState to do shell script "defaults read com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles"     if oldHiddenVisiblesState is in {"1", "YES"} then         set newHiddenVisiblesState to "NO"     end if end try do shell script "defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles " &amp; newHiddenVisiblesState   tell application "Finder"     set theWindows to every Finder window     repeat with i from 1 to number of items in theWindows         set this_item to item i of theWindows         set theView to current view of this_item         if theView is list view then             set current view of this_item to icon view         else             set current view of this_item to list view          end if         set current view of this_item to theView     end repeat end tell /code/pre  Then Save as an application, which you can then just double-click to toggle showing/hiding invisible files.  You don't need to kill the Finder for this toggle, a refresh is sufficient - &amp; may be faster.  <comment190531> The window redraw has the same effect as a Finder restart FWIW. I wouldn't say it's faster, but having the ability to detect and toggle state is nice. <comment190591> I used to find the Finder sometimes took a few seconds to come back up [though I used to have HD not SSD, so that might be the difference] <comment284317> It is a sad fact that this seems to be by far the simplest way. Thank you for this brief moment of sanity <comment361729> This did not work for me.  Ian C.'s suggestion below however, did work. <comment361770> @DarrellGolliher - this worked at the time, it doesn't since El Capitan. Here's the other version - https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/258741/85275 & how to set it to a key command too.
