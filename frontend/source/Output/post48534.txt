Is it possible to play sound through both the headphone jack and my internal speakers? <body> I'd really like to be able to play sound through emboth/em the headphone jack emand/em my internal speakers on my MBP. Is this possible? If so, how?  <answer48910> In my experience, the answer is no. As soon as you plug in the headphones into the 3.5mm jack, it replaces the internal speakers as the default output (and vice versa when you unplug them). There are several discussions around as to whether this is actually a limitation in the hardware or the software, but the end result always seems to be the same.   Now this may not answer specifically what you're asking, but for interest, the only time I've had any success with simultaneous headphone and speaker output is when using a USB device, such as a headset or USB speakers. In order to get this to work, you'll need to plug in the USB device, then do the following:  ul liStart the Apple "Audio MIDI Setup" utility (code/Applications/Utilities/Audio MIDI Setup/code) /li liSelect the "+" in the bottom-left and select "Create Multi-Output Device"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fPxPS.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liSelect the Multi-Output Device that has been added and in the right-hand pane, select both the "Built-in Ouput" and your USB device. That should look something like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8z2FO.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liStart "System Preferences" â†’ "Sound" and click the "Output" tab. Select the "Multi-Output Device" thats now there.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5WVdN.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liAn unfortunate side-effect of this, as "The selected device has no output controls" eludes to is that you now can't control the volume in the normal manner. To do this, you'll have to go back to Audio MIDI Setup and do it from there for each of the outputs. So be careful with those headset and speaker levels to begin with!!!  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xGZ7m.png" alt="enter image description here"/li /ul  And thats it :) So, now when you play a song in iTunes, for instance, that should come out of both the headset and the speakers.  However, whilst all this may be largely academic without a USB headset or speakers, I did also come across the Griffin iMic which says:     iMic supports both mic and line level inputs via a selectable switch,   and provides a line-level output for connecting speakers or   headphones.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QTR9y.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  I've not tried it, but if you're willing to spend the money, that may allow you to connect a pair of headphones with a normal 3.5mm jack then, using the method above, get audio out of both the internal speakers and the headphones simultaneously.   <comment55852> FWIW, I've tried to do this in the past to and the answer always came up as no. As soon as you plug in the headphones into the 3.5mm jack, it replaces the internal speakers as the default output. I have, however, managed to get something working with USB headset/headphones and the internal speakers working simultaneously. Its not quite what you've asked for, but if you've not already discovered this and are interested (as a workaround), I can post it as an answer. <comment55913> @binarybob If it is a viable answer, I'd be interested in it, though I don't have USB headphones/speaker. <comment56061> See also this question and the answers: http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/6510/14994 <comment65366> Thanks! I wish there was a way to do it the way I wanted to but that's how computers work. :-) <comment88032> This worked perfectly for using the speakers on both of my Thunderbolt Displays at the same time. <comment104705> Nice, this worked with a Jambox and my speakers plugged into my computer. Great for parties. <comment119610> binary bob solved my prob... almost now how can i adjust for apparent blutooth delay whenusing both head set and built in out put
