iPhone 6 - issue with messages being copied to people I did not send it to <body> Sometimes I send a message to myself, such as a quick list of places to go. When I do, two of my contacts get copied. What setting or list is causing this?  <comment314461> You need to give us more info than that if you want a good answer. Take a look at [ask] on how to ask good questions. <comment314509> It sounds like you have a group message set up. That is the only way to send messages to multiple people at the same time.
