Problem with usb drive in virtualbox <body> I have a macbook pro and a osx of 10.8.4 in installed on it. I also have VirtualBox 4.2.14 and extension 4.2.14r86644 installed on it. I installed windows8 64bit and now I have problem with usb drives. My windows8 guest operating system didn't recognize my usb drive, although I made a filter for my usb drive.  What can I do and how can I find the problem and solve it?  <comment111548> What filter fro USB ? <comment111593> The regular virtual box filter for usb drives! <comment141673> Can you explain what you are calling _not_ _recognizing_?
