HDMI External Monitor Registers Signal but goes to sleep <body> I've been using an external monitor via HDMI to thunderbolt with my macbook for months. Suddenly, when I plug it in, the monitor "acts like my computer is sleeping". The cord works and when I unplug it, the message on the monitor actually says "no input". When I plug it in, the message goes away but it seems to go into standby. In my Mac settings, when I go to displays, it says that no displays are detected. My laptop monitor works just fine. I don't know enough about Macs to know how to troubleshoot this problem. Everything was working normally on Friday and I didn't perform any updates that I know of. Any help is appreciated. Thanks!   I am running Mac OS X 10.10.5 Yosemite
