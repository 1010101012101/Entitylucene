Exiting/Starting the Terminal (El Capitan) <body> In the latest Mac OS X Terminal version I noticed that if I type codeexit/code and the press codeEnter/code, I get the following:  precodeLast login: Wed Jan 27 09:18:48 on ttys000 Ian-iMac:~ Ian$ exit logout Saving session... ...copying shared history... ...saving history...truncating history files... ...completed.  [Process completed] /code/pre  As far as I can remember, previous versions of the terminal, simply closed the window when you entered codeexit/code.  Is there anyway to restart the same terminal after code[Process completed]/code displays? Or should I completely close the window and restart the terminal? It looks like I can't type anything after entering code[Process completed]/code displays.  <answer225193> When the Shell exits, it means that you are done. So one option is to close the window and manually start another one (or you can simply press kbdcmd/kbd+kbdN/kbd to automatically open another shell).  Another option that can save you some time is to make Terminal automatically close the tab after the exit process has been performed properly. Open Terminal Preferences  Profiles  Select your profile  Shell tab  When the shell exits -- Close the window. In such a way, if you want to start again your shell (after having exit) you should just open another one.  <answer225235> Once it says "Process Completed", the Terminal's session has been terminated, and there is no way to restart that specific session. You may close the window and open a new one or open a new tab on the same window.  <comment273403> In my specific case, I found very useful ^D (ctrl+D)
