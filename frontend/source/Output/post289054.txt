How to assign location (stored with photo) to a contact? <body> I have a photo taken with GPS locations which I can see in Photos (MacOS 10.12.5) with Cmd-I.  I would like to either assign that location to a new contact, or simply just open it in the full maps application so I can do it from there.  Given I cannot easily locate the original in the photos library, how can I do that?
