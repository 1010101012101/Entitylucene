Is it possible to wipe an entire iCloud Photo Library? <body> I've been using the beta iCloud Photo Library for a week and a bunch of photos got duplicated and I'd like to wipe all the photos out and start over.  I have backups of all the photos and have turned off iPhoto Cloud Library on all iOS devices. When I log into the web app - it still shows dozens of albums and I can delete all the photos, then go to deleted items and then purge them, but the ghost albums are still there messing things up.  I've turned off the library entirely and you can see there is a 30 day waiting period.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/O8jXQ.png" alt="enter image description here"  If I click on albums, there are pages of them and no delete button anywhere. If I turn on the library on an iOS device, data starts flooding back as if I wanted to recover the photos.  I don't want to recover anything, I want a clean wipe and clean slate.  Currently, there are 7807 photos in the deleted album and no way to mass delete them. I have 31 albums that show up in iCloud and no way to delete them.  Is there some way to accelerate this or must people wait a month for a corrupt library to eventually be purged to start over?  (I have tickets open with AppleCare after carefully reading the FAQ and it's escalated to engineering, but I was informed that it might be a week or two before it gets seen :-( Perhaps someone has a better idea to clear things out or noticed something I've missed.)  <answer177731> strongemAnswer:/em/strong  strongemYes/em/strong  strongHere is how:/strong  ol liOn your iDevice/s (iPhone, iPad, etc), go to Settings  Photos &amp; Camera  and turn off the "iCloud Photo Library (Beta)" option./li liOnce you have turned iCloud Photo Library off on any/all of your iDevices/iOS Devices, go to https://www.icloud.com/#photos, and delete any/all photos you want to delete on there./li /ol  After that, your iCloud Photo Library should be cleared/wiped out.    strongNote:/strong  If for some reason you turn the "iCloud Photo Library (Beta)" option back on in iOS, and the old/deleted photos are still there, just delete them off of the device/s first, then repeat the steps I mentioned above.  <answer177739> What is the delete button is disabled, not clickable   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/m6VmC.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer179483> For a short while, there was no way to mass delete photos once you store them in the iCloud Photo Library using the web interface. Now that Photos Version 1.0 exists on the Mac, this is trivial to accomplish.

I'm looking to bulk clear everything and start fresh without waiting the 29 days. I'll need you to put up a screen shot of step #2. How exactly do you delete one or several photos? As I mentioned in the bounty - the volume of photos I have crashes Photos on iOS when I ask it to "delete all" - nothing actually deletes. <comment210349> As you can see in my photo, I've already "deleted" the photos, but all the "zombie" albums are still there and even the photos haven't been deleted. I agree the delete buttons are either not working or absent entirely from the web interface. Pretty odd for something Apple has promoted so heavily as the next thing in Photo management for users. <comment212309> Try setting the date back manually a month or more on your IOS device. <comment212353> @ili So I understand your concept. Today is April 1 - what date should I set an iOS device? At this point, I've turned off iCloud syncing since the library is so messed up and AFAIK - the time is kept in Apple's cloud servers with the "truth" copy of the database but I'm willing to try anything since it's April Fool's day. <comment212405> You could try setting it to around when the albums were created, then try and delete them; or you could try setting it a month back - delete, then set it two months back, delete. This technique has worked for some people, so it might be worth a try. <comment212413> FYI - [topic/discussion](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6699647?start=15&tstart=15). (the second post on page two is what I'm referring to). <comment212920> @ili - Awesome. I might have to try that with the 15 "stuck" photos that remain after engineering deleted all the photos they could. I'm a little freaked out that even Apple's engineers can't/won't delete my photos in the cloud after asking nicely and waiting two weeks. :-( :-( <comment212931> Did they indicate why they couldn't delete the 15 remaining photos? I find the entire situation odd myself. Good thing Hilary Clinton doesn't use an iPhone; she might have to dispatch a predator drone to wipe out her photos. I'm sure she'll rest easier knowing they're safely under her control in the Bahamas. <comment212935> @ili The problem is indirection. I have to call and get by AppleCare tier one. Then they escalate to a "senior advisor" or level two. That person can change the iCloud account into "assisted mode" or some such term. Basically, they use the temporary support pin to validate me. Then they have me initiate a password change of their choice. At that point, Apple Support is verified as one of my "trusted devices" and they can access my account. Then it gets pushed to "Engineering" and we both wait. The isolation between engineer and end user is understandable, but frustrating nonetheless. <comment212950> I just can't fathom why they wouldn't have been able to delete all of the photos as you wanted. Do they not have control of their own servers? If there were something on their servers that **urgently** needed to be removed they might not even be capable of doing it â€” that's not very reassuring. <comment212959> @ili Me neither. It feels like [Kafka](https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/metamorphosis/id395543620?mt=11) and people that are so used to not being effective that they've given up communicating clearly. If I really needed it down, I'd report a privacy violation at http://www.apple.com/privacy/privacy-policy/ and/or http://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/contact/ but this isn't a true violation since the photos are innocent and I don't want to "cry wolf" just because AppleCare is disappointing me this instance. <comment216101> there is no way of deleting "recently deleted" on iCloud.com, is there? i'm currently also waiting for photos finish to sync so i can delete "recently deleted" there.... <comment216102> @PascalHeinemann I'm not aware of that functionality on the web. Photos app on OS X does have the ability to wipe everything cleanly. It wasn't released when I asked this question. <comment224673> Thanks. Lots of options now once the delete functionality was implemented. Things are much better now. <comment292074> Dunno why they don't just have a Delete All option with confirm.  Thank you for this information as it did save from having to select over 1000 images one by one .... <comment309897> How do you do this on a mac computer? Shift clicking on a mac is not working for me. <comment335000> The shift key short cut no longer works. <comment335112> Can confirm that on macOS shift-selecting is not working. <comment335695> Confirmed working on macOS Sierra 10.12.1 for Photos version 2.0 using the Command-A method as commented by 'bmike' as well as the Select-SHIFT method. <comment343594> Ok I don't have enough rep on this SE to answer, but anyone running into this problem today can do it via their iPhone. Go to: `Settings  iCloud  Storage  Manage Storage  iCloud Photo Library` and hit delete/disable! They do unfortunately impose a 30-day waiting limit before permanent deletion (giving you time to download everything). <comment349704> I can confirm that this does NOT work on any of the top 4 windows browsers, leaving the majority of computer users with no solution to this problem.  What is wrong with Apple?  I've been using computers since the Apple ][ and can't fathom how such a simple operation has apparently been rendered completely impossible.  I've been trying to do this for over an hour now.
