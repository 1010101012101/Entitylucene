Where is the hard disk in the mid 2012 15" Macbook pro with retina <body> I was following various guides for replacing the hard drive. However my mac does not seem to have the standard 2.5" SSD/SATA drive: see this screenshot:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nGtX9.png" alt="enter image description here"  The black rectangular sections are too small to be 'normal' 2.5hdd's as can be seen here when comparing to the SSD:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/x9DrC.png" alt="enter image description here"  Does anyone know  ul liwhat emare/em those rectangular black compartments/li lihow do I swap this (or another smaller?) SSD into the MBPro?/li /ul  <answer246190> ol liAll the black compartments are the Li- Ion Polymer batteries which power your MacBook Pro.    /li liYou won't be able to swap a 2.5'' drive in your Macbook because the Mid 2012 Retina models use a flash memory module.img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sHPAc.jpg" alt="enter image description here" Here you can see a guide to upgrading the SSD./li /ol  <comment303466> All the black compartments are the batteries. <comment303467> OK thx I did not know that. Where is the hard drive? <comment303468> Your MacBook Pro uses a flash memory module so you won't be able to fit a 2.5'' drive in. That is where it is positioned http://bit.ly/29BSSaA . And here you can see a guide on replacing it http://bit.ly/29VUATE . <comment303469> @John Well that merits an awarded answer: so answer away please. <comment303472> Thx for the answer. I'm not necessarily *thrilled* about the apparent cost (if even possible) to do the 512GB upgrade .. <comment305255> Love it. Four downvotes and no comments. It's lovely to be a low rep user on this forum.
