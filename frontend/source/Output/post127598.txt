Multiple icons in dock? <body> Is it possible to have multiple icons open for multiple instances of an application? For example, if I have two pdf's open, can I have two "preview" icons open in the doc bar?   <answer127627> You can open multiple instances of a mac application using codeopen -n/code terminal command. Eg. codeopen -n image2.pdf/code   More information.  <answer127628> Because I have to do that quite often : Yes, it is indeed possible and it makes use of the command provided in the answer by kekub.  Just create an application with Automator: br/ 1) Open Automator br/ 2) Choose "Application" br/ 3) Search for the Shell-Script workflow element br/ 4) Change the Input to "As Arguments" br/ 5) Adjust the Shell script like this : br/  pre     for f in "$@"     do         open -a preview -n "$f"     done /pre  6) Save the Programm as Something like "Preview+" br/ 7) Optional :  Change the default application for images to this created app br/ 8) Optional : Move it to the dock and drop images on it. br/  Now for each Image there will be a new instance of Preview. br/  You can do that with every app you like. br/  <comment149560> Nice!
