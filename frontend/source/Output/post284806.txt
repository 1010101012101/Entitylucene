No network discovery over secure shared connection <body> On my iMac 2011 running OS X 10.8.5, Iâ€™ve been using the share functionality to share the Ethernet connection over Wi-Fi. It worked just fine and I was able to search the network on every device connected to this Wi-Fi (meaning SMB sharing, SSH, ...).  Now I've realized that it's highly insecure to not have a password protected Wi-Fi, so I enabled WPA2 Personal. Every connected device still has Internet connection, but they can't find each other over the network. That's embarrassing in the way that I've got a media centre (OSMC) connected, and now I'm not able to control it except from the iMac itself.  strongEDIT/strong : I tried it with a 2009 MacBook Pro running El Captain (OS X 10.11.6), and what I want to do emworks/em perfectly fine (apart from the fact that sharing is not as stable with this hardware).  strongEDIT 2/strong : if what I want to do is not possible on this version of OS X, maybe there is a way to disable the WPA2 security and filter allowed devices (by their MAC address) but :  ul lihow to do so ?/li liis it secure enough ?/li /ul
