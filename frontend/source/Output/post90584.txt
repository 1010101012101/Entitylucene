How to find files not containing comment x? <body> I try to find all "*.xyz" files in folder x which does not have comment "abc". This code does the opposite. I would prefer to use Spotlight if possible. How i can do this?  Thanks  precodedo shell script "mdfind -onlyin '/path/to/folder/x' kMDItemFinderComment == 'abc' kMDItemFSName == '*.xyz'" /code/pre  <answer90587> While in the folder press kbdCommand/kbd+kbdF/kbd. This will bring up a new Finder window with the options to strongSearch/strong either in emThis Mac/em or in the current folder. Choose the name of the folder.  You'll be able to add new criteria to the search by pressing the Add (+) button on the right side of the search window. Clicking on the newly added criteria, a drop-down list will let you choose between the default ones. By choosing emOther/em you'll be given a lot more options. Look for emSpotlight Comments/em, and hit emOk/em.  When using Spotlight you can search for files which do not match certain criteria by typing the operand strongNOT/strong before the emkeyword/em. So, once you've configured your emSearch/em options, just typing codeNOT abc/code in the emSpotlight comment/em criteria will do the trick.  <answer90714> The expression has to be a single argument. Subexpressions can be joined with code&amp;&amp;/code:  precodemdfind 'kMDItemFinderComment!=abc&amp;&amp;kMDItemFSName=*.xyz' -onlyin /path/to/folder/x /code/pre  <comment106334> I'd think it was enough to change the `==` to `!=`? Try `do shell script "mdfind -onlyin '/path/to/folder/x' kMDItemFinderComment != 'abc' kMDItemFSName == '*.xyz'"`. <comment106348> @Emil That might work, but he asks too for a possible way of doing this with Spotlight. <comment106366> @Thecafremo Sure, it's just a suggestion :) <comment106506> Thanks for answers. Emil, i still have trouble with this. do shell script "mdfind -onlyin " & my_path & " kMDItemFSName == '*.scpt' kMDItemFinderComment != 'abc'" --lists .scpt files but does not filter comments do shell script "mdfind -onlyin " & my_path & " kMDItemFinderComment != 'abc' kMDItemFSName == '*.scpt'" --list all files not just .scpt <comment109124> +1 Didn't know `&&` was an operator (its counterpart, `||`, is also an operator). The expression can also be written with spaces to make it more readable: `'kMDItemFinderComment != abc && kMDItemFSName = *.xyz'`. A nice introduction to `mdfind` can be found here at http://blog.superuser.com/2011/06/03/digging-deeper-mastering-spotlight-in-os-x/.
