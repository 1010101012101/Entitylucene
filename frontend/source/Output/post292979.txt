What is the keyboard shortcut for Sleep Display on Macs with a Touch ID power key? <body> Way back in the mists of time, when we’d insert funny little mirrors into our Macs, we could hit kbdControl ⌃/kbd kbdShift ⇧/kbd and kbdEject ⏏/kbd to immediately put our display to sleep.  Once the mirror slot and its attendant kbdEject ⏏/kbd key was removed, we could do the same thing by pressing ⌃ kbdShift ⇧/kbd and kbdPower ⌽⏻/kbd. However, I’ve just got a 2017 MacBook Pro, and when I use the same key combination with its Touch ID power button, nothing happens.  Is there a way (preferably without installing any additional software) to enable this keyboard shortcut for immediately putting the display to sleep, or to enable a different keyboard shortcut to do the same thing, on this Mac?
