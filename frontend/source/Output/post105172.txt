scanner driver Samsung Xpress M267X/287X <body> I don’t get the Samsung Xpress M267X/287X scanner to work with 10.8. The scanner shows up in Image Capture but it need additional software, which it can’t find.  Does someone has a link to the right drivers?  <answer105251> You should be able to download this from Samsung's support center. There were new scan drivers released 9th of April this year and they can be found here: http://www.samsung.com/us/support/owners/product/SL-M2875FD/XAA  Remember to follow the instructions supported by Samsung:          Security setting should be changed in order to install drivers in Mac OS X 10.8:          Run [System Preferences] under [Application] folder          Select [Security &amp; Privacy]          Select [Anywhere] under [Allow applications downloaded from]
