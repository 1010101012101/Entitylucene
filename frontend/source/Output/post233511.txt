Locked iPhone. What do I do? <body> My iPhone 6 is locked. I waited one minute and it still says to wait.  It is frozen.  How can I fix this problem?  <comment285368> Hit home button and power for 10 or so seconds to reset and then power on again see if that helps <comment285369> Also attach a screenshot <comment285372> @SeanClt Please explain me how you can make a screenshot with a frozen device ;) <comment285373> Take a pic with some other camera and attach <comment285375> You could go through Apple's steps or edit this to narrow down what specifically you intend to do - erase the device? wait out the minute? connect to iTunes? - https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204306
