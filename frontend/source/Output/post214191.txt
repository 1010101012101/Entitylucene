Shortcut key to open/apply profile in Terminal <body> When in Terminal, I use kbdCmd-,/kbd to open the settings. I can then press up and down to scroll through profiles. But then pressing enter doesn't open a new window with that profile but instead edits the profile name.   This is driving me nuts. Is there a keyboard command to just open the profile so that I don't have to keep going to the mouse?  <answer214208> I didn't find a way to launch a profile from Terminal preferences, but I know a workaround.  All the available profiles are shown in the Shell menu.  You can move focus to the menu bar by assigning it a keyboard shortcut in System Preferences:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VxkpZ.png" alt="Setting the keyboard shortcut in Sys Prefs"  By default, this highlights the  menu but you can just press the right arrow key twice, down to New Window, right to open the sub menu, then down until you get the right one and press enter.  A new Terminal window with the specified profile will be launched and you won't need to use the mouse/trackpad.  <answer214308> h2To Create a new Window or Tab with a Specific Profile/h2  You can assign keyboard shortcuts to the items in the strongShell  New Window/strong and strongNew Tab/strong submenus using strongSystem Preferences  Keyboard  Shortcuts  App Shortcuts/strong to add shortcuts to Terminal.  For example, if you add     Homebrew ⌥⌘9   to the preferences, typing kbd⌥/kbd-kbd⌘/kbd-kbd9/kbd will open a new terminal window with the Homebrew profile.  If you want to assign keys for creating tabs, you'll need to explicitly refer to the New Tab submenu using “-”. For example, I have this in my preferences:     Shell-New Tab-Homebrew ⌥⇧⌘9   Typing kbd⌥/kbd-kbd⇧/kbd-kbd⌘/kbd-kbd9/kbd will open a new tab with the Homebrew profile.  h2To Apply a Profile to the Current Terminal/h2  You can change the profile of the current terminal using the Inspector window. You can use strongShell  Show/Hide Inspector ⌘I/strong to show or hide the Inspector. In the Inspector’s strongSettings/strong tab you can use the keyboard to select a new profile—you can use the up/down arrow keys or type the name of a profile.
