Color song lists? <body> I have iTunes 12.5.5.5, which I think is the latest version.  The expandable lists of songs under an album in the album view:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/w12Ou.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  is currently bland grey, but used to be colored by iTunes based on the colors within the album art.  How do I get this beautiful functionality back?
