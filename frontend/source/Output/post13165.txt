Is a "Not Charging" iPad still drawing power when not sleeping <body> When an iPad is "not charging" and is not sleeping, is it still drawing power from the USB port so it doesn't drain or at least drain slower?  <answer13166> Yes.  It's just that the power it's drawing is not enough to both run the device and charge the battery at the same time.  <comment110050> By trial with my own iPad, I have found that it also does charge while in this state just very very slowly.
