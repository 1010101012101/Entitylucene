Mounting HFS+ volume in Linux <body> I'm not sure if this is the appropriate area to post my question. But I am wondering how can I mount a MacBook Pro mid 2007 HDD on Debian Linux. My MacBook bombed out on me and now I need to attempt to recover some data on the hard drive. What hardware do I need to hook it up through USB and should read privileges be enough to copy from drive to else where?  <answer215119> You need a SATA to USB connector kit or 2.5" SATA External USB Enclosure, either will do.  Read-Only access is all that you need to retrieve the User Data you want to save.

This is for Ubuntu, but should work for you: https://askubuntu.com/questions/332315/how-to-read-and-write-hfs-journaled-external-hdd-in-ubuntu-without-access-to-os/li liUse a SATA-to-USB-Adaptor, you should be able to buy one for about 15-20 â‚¬ or $. I've never seen one being incompatible with Linux./li liI'm not sure, but this should be the appropriate guide for you to disassemble the device and get the hard drive out of there: IFIXIT/li /ol  <comment259810> This _might_ be more appropriate for the UNIX SE.
