Is it possible to add an HTML Snippet to Numbers on OS X? <body> Is it possible to add an HTML Snippet to Numbers on OS X?  I would like to add some html code and have Numbers treat it as such, for example to use iframes embed websites into my document.  Would this be possible somehow?  <answer215168> Not currently.  strongNumbers/strong does not have a strongSafari/strong or strongWebKit/strong rendering engine to translate HTML, CSS and JavaScript so as to render content marked up for the Web.  This functionality is currently not supported in strongMicrosoft Excel/strong or even strongGoogle Sheets/strong either.  See this similar answer related to Google Sheets on WebApps Stack Exchange.  The user there explains:     Google docs won't actually render HTML, or execute any code pasted   into it.
