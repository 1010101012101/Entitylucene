MacBook Air (bought in August 2014) <body> With the recent Yosemite software update (I updated on 23rd February 2015) the cool 'bubble' sound that the volume keys made when pressed is now gone and replaced with a different sound. How do I get the old one back?   <answer174270> While it is always difficult to describe the sound (I can only guess which one you mean), I am offering you to find it first.  precode/System/Library/Sounds/ /code/pre  Once found:  Copy the file to desktop and rename it in to Volume.aiff  Now go here code/System/Library/LoginPlugins/BezelServices.loginPlugin/Contents/Resources//code find and rename the Volume.aiff in to oldvolume.aiff  Last step, move the file from desktop in to this folder.  <comment205187> @IconDaemon Whilst that's related, that's not a duplicateâ€”it still requires the original file to replace the new file with.
