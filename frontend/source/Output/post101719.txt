Trouble opening plist files in text editor <body> From Finder, I can preview a plist file without any difficulties. For example, using Quick Look with code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Safari.RSS.plist/code I get a nice preview of its contents:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sKYsZ.png" alt="Quick Look"  However, if I then try to open the file, either with TextEdit, or any other editor (I've tried SublimeText, TextMate, Vim, Nano, and Coda 2 so far), the encoding appears to be off:  precodebplist00Ò_"FixedRefreshesInBackgroundSettings_(com.apple.PreferenceSync.ExcludeSyncKeys ¡ 2]^����������������������������` /code/pre  Here's what it looks like if I open it with TextEdit:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kQ9vC.png" alt="TextEdit"  I've tried changing the encoding in Sublime Text and other apps, but that doesn't help.  Any thoughts?  I'm running 10.8.4.  <answer101720> plist files are not necessarily plain text so they need to be run through a converter. Finder and Xcode (which has a plist editor) do this without telling the user  The binary format is documented in this C code so any application can convert it and someone has written a format description in English and more Apple documentation here but note that it references old paths in code/Developer/Documentation/code  The command line program plutil can convert to and from XML  e.g. to view a binary property list in XML format on stdout:  precodeplutil -convert xml1 -o - &lt;file name&gt; /code/pre  Also to convert a binary to a XML plist in place and then leave it so that the user program can read either.  precodeplutil -convert xml1 &lt;file name&gt; /code/pre  <answer101968> You can also edit plist files with PlistBuddy, which is a command-line program.  PlistBuddy is located at code/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy/code.  <answer197149> You can convert the property list file from binary format into XML using the following command line:  precodeplutil -convert xml1 -o file.plist file.plist /code/pre  Then edit it as usual. Secondly you don't have to convert it back, as usually apps recognise both formats.  <comment119884> Thanks. I see. So if I need to edit it, I need to convert it to XML, open it with an editor, and then convert it back. I will assume this is so. No need to reply unless I got it wrong! <comment119886> You can also use `plutil -convert xml1 ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Safari.RSS.plist` to convert the plist to XML in place. And after you edit the plist, you don't have to convert it back to binary.
