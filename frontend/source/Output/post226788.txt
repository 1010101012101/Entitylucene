Monitor connected via Display Port is not recognized correctly <body> I connected my DELL U2711 via Displayport to Mini Displayport to my MacBook Pro Retina (OSX 10.11.2) It recognized the monitor as a TV and does not show anything. I tried also using an adapter to DVI. There it shows an image but not the maximum resolution. What can I do so it is recognized correctly. I found several posts in the apple forum about people having the same problem non of these solutions worked for me. The Monitor used to work when I organized my desk I unplugged it and since then it is not working anymore.  https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5381092?tstart=0  <comment275406> I found this post: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/106933/mavericks-not-able-to-use-external-display-at-full-resolution But it does not help me with 10.11.2. <comment275414> http://www.ireckon.net/2013/03/force-rgb-mode-in-mac-os-x-to-fix-the-picture-quality-of-an-external-monitor (not working either)
