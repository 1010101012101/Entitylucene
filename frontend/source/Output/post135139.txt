Putting SSH keys I've taken from Ubuntu <body> I came over to Mac from Ubuntu. I've saved all SSH files I had in the strong.ssh/strong folder in Ubuntu. There are three files  ul liid_rsa/li liid_rsa.pub/li liknown_hosts/li /ul  Is it possible to reuse these files in Mac? If so, where do I put them?  <answer135144> You have to put them in the code~/.ssh//codebr OS X uses the same OpenSSH package as every other unix. Make sure you have set correct permissions, or ssh will not accept your keys  precodedrwx------   5 user  staff   170 May 28 20:14 ./ -rw-------   1 user  staff  1679 May 19 14:19 id_rsa -rw-r--r--@  1 user  staff   400 May 19 14:19 id_rsa.pub -rw-r--r--   1 user  staff  6380 May 31 03:09 known_hosts /code/pre  <comment160175> How do I set the permissions exactly like you, because I think I'm less restrictive than you in my permission set...? <comment161820> `cd ~/.ssh ; chmod 700 . ; chmod 400 id_rsa ; chmod og-w *`
