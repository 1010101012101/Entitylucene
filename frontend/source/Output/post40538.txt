Native Youtube app rejects correct login details <body> Whenever I try and log into the native Youtube app on my iPhone, it reports 'Authentication Failed" even though the details are 100% correct. Here's what I've done so far:  ul liYoutube.com accepts my username and password on both the desktop and iPhone web app./li liI've reset my Youtube password/li liI get the same results over 3G or wifi (tried multiple networks, incl. Apple Store), so it is not my carrier or ISP blocking Youtube. /li liA friend logged in with his account and the iPhone accepted it, so it isn't specific to the iPhone./li liI've used my own account on someone else's iPhone and it didn't work, once again ruling out my iPhone./li liI've 'unlocked' my account using the Google Captcha page/li liI've even resorted to creating a new Google/Youtube account/li /ul  None of these has helped. The only thing I can think of is that the account details are still propagating through Youtube's systems and has not yet came through to the 'iPhone section' of their database. I doubt that this is something that should even happen, but I'm lost as for what I can do.  Normally I would contact Youtube support, but there is no customer support for Youtube! What can I do?  <answer40543> Try using your full gmail e-mail address as the username, then your password. I'm using this approach to use Google's two-factor authentication, but may still work for your situation.  <answer40547> You may need to create an app-specific password for YouTube:  Cannot log in on Youtube iPad app  <comment45865> flagged this question, as it is not a problem with the Apple software or hardware, its a problem with YouTube <comment45887> It sounds as though you have encountered a frustrating problem here. Unfortunately, it falls outside the scope of the expertise for this site. <comment65467> If you want, you can ask this on another site, such as [WebApps](http://webapps.stackexchange.com)
