Turning off keyboard popup <body> When I connect a bluetooth keyboard to my computer, it pops up this icon:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jG68ll.png" alt="keyboard popup"  Can I get rid of that?  <answer113440> strongDISCLAIMER:  I have never tried this - though it should not hurt your system./strong  You emcould/em remove code/System/Library/LoginPlugins/BezelServices.loginPlugin/code... but removing this package would take all the bezel style interface items with it.  (volume up/down, brightness, remote paring, etc.)  Removing this package could have undesired effects, beyond just removing the bezels, but I can't think of any specifically...   It should work...  However, keep a copy of it, make note of the permissions, and put it back if it dorks other stuff up.  Also, expect later updates of OS X to replace this package...  Some may suggest viewing the contents of the package and removing just the bezels you don't want from code/System/Library/LoginPlugins/BezelServices.loginPlugin/Contents/Resources/BezelUI/HiDPI/code but I notice there is a _CodeSignature directory here: code/System/Library/LoginPlugins/BezelServices.loginPlugin/Contents/_CodeSignature/code and that may invalidate the entire package.  strongAfter making whatever changes you want to the BezelServices.loginPlugin you should probably restart your computer, or at the very least log out and back in - before you will see the desired effect./strong  Sorry for not providing a clearer answer.  <comment132423> I've never heard of or seen any way to do this, so I am tempted to say "no" but I am curious to see if maybe there is a way. <comment133167> Sorry, I don't know how to suppress it showing up, but are you saying it does not disappear after only a few seconds? If it stays on screen, then that is not normal behavior. When my bluetooth trackpad connects I get a similar icon for only a few seconds - it will appear also if I lose the connection, say from a weak battery. <comment133182> It stays for only a few seconds. I just want it to never show up.
