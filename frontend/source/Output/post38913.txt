MacPorts 2.0.3 uninstalling package gives error "this entry does not own the given file" <body> I'm hitting an error while trying to uninstall some packages in my MacPorts 2.0.3 installation, and I can't figure out what's causing them or how to resolve them.  Googling around lead to nothing addressing this case, so I'm hoping that fellow users here will have an answer.  Here is an example of the command and the error (where this is all done in a sudo'ed shell, so the problem is unrelated to root permissions):  pre port uninstall sleuthkit ---  Deactivating sleuthkit @3.2.3_0+universal Error: Target org.macports.deactivate returned: this entry does not own the given file Log for sleuthkit is at: /opt/local/var/macports/logs/_opt_local_var_macports_registry_portfiles_sleuthkit_3.2.3_0+universal/sleuthkit/main.log Warning: Failed to execute portfile from registry for sleuthkit @3.2.3_0+universal ---  Deactivating sleuthkit @3.2.3_0+universal Error: Target org.macports.uninstall returned: this entry does not own the given file Warning: Failed to execute portfile from registry for sleuthkit @3.2.3_0+universal ---  Deactivating sleuthkit @3.2.3_0+universal Error: Target org.macports.deactivate returned: this entry does not own the given file Log for sleuthkit is at: /opt/local/var/macports/logs/_opt_local_var_macports_registry_portfiles_sleuthkit_3.2.3_0+universal/sleuthkit/main.log Warning: Failed to execute portfile from registry for sleuthkit @3.2.3_0+universal ---  Deactivating sleuthkit @3.2.3_0+universal Error: port uninstall failed: this entry does not own the given file /pre  Looking in the file code/opt/local/var/macports/logs/_opt_local_var_macports_registry_portfiles_sleuthkit_3.2.3_0+universal/sleuthkit/main.log/code reveals nothing particularly useful to me:  pre  version:1  :debug:main Executing org.macports.main (sleuthkit)  :debug:deactivate deactivate phase started at Tue Jan 31 19:18:24 EST 2012  :debug:deactivate Executing org.macports.deactivate (sleuthkit)  :msg:deactivate ---  Deactivating sleuthkit @3.2.3_0+universal  :error:deactivate Target org.macports.deactivate returned: this entry does not own the given file  :debug:deactivate Backtrace: this entry does not own the given file      while executing  "$port deactivate $imagefiles"      invoked from within  "registry::write {              $port deactivate $imagefiles              foreach file $files {                  _deactivate_file $file              }      ..."

More importantly, how can I fix my installation so that this doesn't happen anymore?  <answer103589> Re install the required package then restart the computer and then run the uninstall.  Get into an elevated shell by using codesudo -su/code firstly each time.  <comment76108> I can't help but notice your'e not using `sudo ports uninstall` (emphasis on the `sudo`). You might be using a root account, or maybe your installation of macports requires no administrator priviliges, but just in case you might have forgotten... I'm pretty sure you need to use `sudo ports uninstall` Just throwing this out there. Hope it helps. Kevin <comment76109> No, sorry, I was already in a root shell when I ran the commands.  Should I have mentioned it.  I'll edit the question to make that clear. <comment121904> Try again using `sudo ports uninstall` and see if you have the same errors. The errors **do** look like permissions
