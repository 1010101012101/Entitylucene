How can I enable a notification that a pop-up has been blocked in Safari? <body> strongQUESTION/strong: Just wondering how to strongenable/strong an alert message notifying me that a pop-up has been blocked?  I know Firefox has that feature(and other related pop-up options), but I don't use Firefox... also preferably avoid 3rd party apps.  I have Safari 5.1 on Mac OS X 10.6.8.  <answer20086> Better Pop Up Blocker does trigger an alert in Safari when a popup is locked.  And it also improves the effectiveness of Safari's blocking.  But - the alert behaviour does not work in Lion! Snow Leopard only. If the dev updates it for Lion it should do what you request.  <comment22143> I was just wondering the same thing. <comment22158> So you're looking for what amounts to a second switch: silently block pop-ups / noisily block pop-ups ? (just looking to understand what the notification might be) <comment22180> @bmike In Chrome and other browsers, you are alerted to the blocking of a popup by an audio alert and an icon. As far as I can see, no alert is given in Safari. Jon would like to enable such an alert. <comment22188> OP specified 10.6.8 but nice call out on lion issues <comment22282> Thanks! This does the job, specifically: Unchecking `Window targets (Checking this forces pages to load in the same tab)`. I was going to wait until all the bugs are out of Lion anyway.
