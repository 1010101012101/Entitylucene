Increase increment size of keyboard backlight <body> I usually have my keyboard backlight either: all the way up, at the lowest setting or off. It is (slightly) annoying to have to hold down F5/F6 keys, when I never use the middle values.  Is there a way to increase the increment?  Alternatively (perhaps even better), is there a way to get and set the value directly from the terminal or AppleScript?  <comment198441> I'm not on my Mac right now, so I can't test anything. But you can look into /Users - your_username - Library - Preferences, and open com.apple.bezelservice.plist. You have some brighteness preferences... <comment198467> Thank you for the suggestion, but at my end (on Mavericks) that plist only holds 3 keys (BatteryHistory, afActionHistory, randomData).
