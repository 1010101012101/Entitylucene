Some files fail to copy with Android File Transfer <body> I am having a problem copying mp3 files with Android File Transfer, but it only affects certain files/folders - I have been able to copy a number of albums without incident, but others refuse to copy... I have checked permissions, no differences between copies that work and those that don't, put the phone in airplane mode, no effect... The files that refuse to copy are mp3's, but some other mp3's copied OK. Any ideas?  <comment349678> Can you think of _anything_ that the ones which don't copy have in common? For example: (1) Were they all downloaded from online? (2) Or from the same source online? (3) Or perhaps they have DRM protection? (4) Something else... <comment349709> DRM did occur to me, but I can copy the files on the mac, and read them, so it is not at all clear to me how DRM might work.  All were ripped by iTunes from CD's inserted into the optical drive. <comment349715> Aah, okay - well, if they've all been imported from CDs via iTunes then DRM won't be an issue.
