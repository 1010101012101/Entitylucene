How to get videos and music in the same screen? <body> The last version of iTunes I liked was around 2010 when I had all my music and videos in the one menu list. Now if I want to change to videos from music I have to go to the dropdown tab (via mouse) at the top of the page. Is there an easier way?  iTunes 12.5.4 Mac  <answer267827> Although the concept of 'easier' is subjective, the simple answer is no. You can get the emidentical/em result (bringing up the movies) by going to the View menu  Media Kind  Movies.  The View menu also shows the associated keystroke commands to accomplish mouse-based actions. Cycling to the Movies window is kbdCommand/kbd-kbd2/kbd.  If keystrokes are 'easier' for you, then perhaps the answer is 'yes'.  <comment336139> It would be helpful to know what version of iTunes you're referring to? And, is it on a Mac or PC?
