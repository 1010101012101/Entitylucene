How can I specify delimiters in Terminal for word and character selection before copying and pasting? <body> I am new to Mac and still struggling to be productive with fewer clicks and keys...  When I use Terminal and click on a word, I would like the delimiter to be only space and not other characters like . _ / etc. I want these to be treated as part of the word. Then, I would like to be able to click on a word, be able to select the whole word and then copy and paste it to another place, say command line or into an editor etc. How do I achieve this?  Many thanks!  <answer25283> You might want to take a look at iTerm2, where you can set the word delimiter in the preferences. I'm a recent convert myself and like it a lot better than Terminal.app. There's a special Terminal.app keyboard shortcut compatibility set to make switching easier.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7QIhf.png" alt="iTerm prefs window screenshot"  <comment28562> Many many thanks!! This is awesome! <comment28605> Note: If you're specifically interested in selecting file and pathnames, Shift-Command-Double-Click will select pathnames (and URLs). <comment28662> You're welcome! I was pointed to iTerm myself a few days ago: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/24994/how-to-keep-the-text-selection-in-terminal-app-when-typing, and I haven't looked back since.
