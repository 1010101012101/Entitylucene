Can I hide the sync icon in the menu bar on Lion? <body> This menu bar icon is useless and takes up space.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Lez7r.jpg" alt="Sync icon"  I use iCloud on Mac OS X Lion to sync contacts, calendars, and the like. On Snow Leopard I could use an option in the iSync preferences to remove this icon from my menu bar, but iSync isn't around anymore. Is there any way to get rid of it?  <answer30424> Just kbdâŒ˜ Command/kbd-Drag &amp; Drop it away from the menu bar, this way you can also re-arrange your icons. This trick will only work for OSX icons (e.g. Time Machine or WiFi), for non OSX native icons (e.g. Dropbox or GeekTool) you need a third party app like Bartender or Menu Bar Rearranger.  <answer31167> That sync icon is also used by MobileMe and another way to get rid of it is to log out of mobileme after migrating to iCloud (System Preferences/MobileMe). I had the same question and finally logged out of mobileme (which wasn't being used anymore) and it disappeared.  <comment34888> Wow, that was easy. Thanks! <comment34901> Same here! It took up some really valuable menu bar real-estate. <comment74106> works just as great on ML <comment86098> To get it back, open Terminal.app and type `open /System/Library/CoreServices/Menu\ Extras/Sync.menu` <comment121819> Cmd click/drag also works for your folder navigations icons. <comment122409> Great tip. How would you get it back if you wanted it?
