How do I disable scaling for specific apps on Retina MacBook Pro? <body> Is it possible to set certain non-Retina enabled apps to not scale up (in other words, run at a native resolution) on the new Retina MacBook Pro?  <answer130313> SwitchResX is what you want. It will allow you to set application specific display sets.  SwitchResX is a commercial third party application, but it is available to try for free and for download. Probably because it is technically a hack to use the full resolution of Retina Displays, it appears to be unavailable on the Mac App Store.  By creating display sets for each application you wish to use the full native Retina Display resolution, effectively, you can disable the scaling for individual applications.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xdpxo.png" alt="Using the the SwitchResX Preferences Panel for Application specific display sets"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ys43Z.png" alt="For example, the set up for Excel looks like this"  <answer176273> It is possible to disable the auto-scaling of all applications from System Preferences  Monitor: https://support.apple.com/en-us/ht5266  Of course you'll see everything smaller :)  <comment126767> I don't believe it's possible. Wouldn't apps running at native resolution be too small to be usable? <comment208070> Welcome to Ask Different!
