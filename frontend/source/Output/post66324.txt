Set Specific Podcasts to Show as TV Shows in iTunes, using AppleScript <body> I'm using on online TV recorder to record TV shows. Those recordings are downloaded as a podcast to iTunes. My following Applescript should just grab those podcasts, update some info fields and finally mark them as "TV show" to have them show up under "TV Shows" in iTunes.  It works very well, only the part where I want to set the video kind to TV show doesn't seem to work.  precodeset video kind of aTrack to TV show /code/pre  I also had a look at this Doug's script that does something similar and I can't find any difference.  Here is my full script:  precodeon matchRegExp(regex, txt, |caseSensitive?|)     if |caseSensitive?| then         set ci to "i"     else         set ci to ""     end if     set theRubyOneLiner to quote &amp; "s = '" &amp; txt &amp; "'; s =~ /" &amp; regex &amp; "/" &amp; ci &amp; "; puts Regexp.last_match.to_a" &amp; quote     set theCommand to "ruby -e " &amp; theRubyOneLiner     set theMatchData to do shell script theCommand     set tid to AppleScript's text item delimiters     set AppleScript's text item delimiters to character id 13 -- new line     set theMatchData to the text items of theMatchData     set AppleScript's text item delimiters to tid     theMatchData end matchRegExp  tell application "iTunes"     set myLib to library playlist 1      set pods to every track of library playlist 1 whose genre is "Podcast" and album is "Online Videorecorder"      set ofi to fixed indexing     set fixed indexing to true      with timeout of 3000 seconds         repeat with aTrack in pods             set desc to long description of aTrack              try                 set episode to last item of my matchRegExp("(Folge|Episode) (\\d+)", desc, true)                 set season to last item of my matchRegExp("(Staffel|Season) (\\d+)", desc, true)             end try              set series to name of aTrack             set title to description of aTrack             set cat to category of aTrack              try                 set video kind of aTrack to TV show             on error m                 log m             end try               set episode number of aTrack to episode             set season number of aTrack to season             set show of aTrack to series             set episode ID of aTrack to title             set description of aTrack to desc         end repeat     end timeout     set fixed indexing to ofi  end tell /code/pre  <answer66330> The problem is that you can't change the "Media Kind" of a podcast track via AppleScript. For whatever reason, it seems to be some sort of special type that isn't exposed in the AppleScript dictionary.  The closest I've found to a method for doing this is this script in the Apple Support Forums that changes the Media Kind via GUI scripting. It seems to be set up for changing it to an Audiobook, so you'll have to modify it a bit, but it may be a decent starting point.
