How can I automatically rotate hundreds of pictures with faces on them in iPhoto? <body> I have a lot of photos in iPhoto that are not correctly rotated. They do not have a horizon in the image, but they do have clear faces so an algorithm could use that as a reference point. I was hoping iPhoto had this function built in, but I can't find it.  It's the latest iPhoto app in Yosemite. Can you guys help me?  <comment181511> You meant rotate photos based on face orientation, isn't it? <comment181520> Yes that's what I meant. Or at least, that's the only way I can imagine that the program would know which way to rotate it. So do you know if there's an automated way to do it?
