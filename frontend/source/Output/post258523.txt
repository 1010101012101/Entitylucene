iPhone 5s completely dead <body> I plugged my iPhone 5s into my computer and this happened:  My phone went black but the backlight remained on and it showed it was connected to iTunes.  I then restarted my iPhone (Home+Power Button) and the phone turned off but didn't turn back on again. (No backlight or Apple symbol...etc).  Ive tried:  Charging overnight  Charging with different chargers  DFU Mode (didn't show in iTunes)  Cleaning the charging port  Switching the battery  What can I do? If anything?  Note: Not water damaged in the least bit. Phones in perfect condition.  <comment323182> Have you brought it to apple? <comment323193> Im currently abroad, with no apple store. Otherwise i would have brought it for sure! I did chat with apple though. They suggested a replacement in the end. I ask here as a last result.
