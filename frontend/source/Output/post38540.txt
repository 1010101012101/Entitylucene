iTunes sync error -50 <body> I recently tried to sync my iOS device, but I got a message similar to this one:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XhYMv.png" alt="unknown error -50 itunes"  I tried googling around, and people generally recommended to disable syncing photos to fix this, but in my case syncing photos was already off.  Any ideas on how to fix this?  <answer38541> I just fixed this by deleting a large video from my iPhone.  Even though I still had about 3 GB left, it seems that iTunes wants there to remain some free space on the iPhone before syncing.  Once I had about 4 GB left, it started syncing again normally.  I hope this helps someone, and for god's sake Apple you could've included a less cryptic error message for such a simple issue.
