Does performance degrade between iOS 3.1 and 4.1 for the iPod Touch 2nd gen? <body> I noticed a considerable performance degradation when updating to iOS 4.0; enough to downgrade back to 3.1.x. Has that issue been completely resolved in 4.1? Having to downgrade again would be a pain.  <answer2927> I've made the updates, and I didn't notice anything about a performance degradation.   <answer3242> I've finally gotten around to trying the 4.1 upgrade, and the responsiveness seems perfectly acceptable now.  <comment2637> I'm confused. Are you saying there doesn't seem to be any performance problem, or you only now noticed a performance problem? Did you notice the issue with the 4.0 version?
