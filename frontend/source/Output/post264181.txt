Safari freezes / hangs while doing swipe back gesture <body> this is really annoying... From time to time Safari freezes when I am doing the swipe left / back to previous page page gesture. The window then starts sliding to the left but stops suddenly. I cannot click in Safari anywhere anymore, it just hangs.  The only work around I have found so far is using CMD+M on the keyboard to minimise Safari and then clicking its dock icon to get it back. Then the gesture completes and Safari is back to normal.  I tried setting back PRAM during but since I have read somewhere this should help but it isn't.  Any idea guys? THANKS!
