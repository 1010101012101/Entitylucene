Cron log to Notification bar <body> I have a couple of cron jobs that I would like to log output to the Notification app in Mountain Lion. I've searched and and figured out how to log cron output by editing the plist file, but nothing specifically about how to integrate into the Notifications app.  <answer84489> You need to use a third party piece of software to send messages to the Notification Center from command line tools and scripts.  terminal-notifier appears to be a popular solution. OSXDaily has an article walking through how to set terminal-notifier up.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SRAic.jpg" alt="OSXDaily screenshot of terminal-notifier in action"  Alternative methods are covered in the answers to, how can I trigger a Notification Center notification from an AppleScript or shell script?  <comment97258> Thanks! That is just what I was looking for. <comment98173> Feel free to edit this to show why / how the liked question is different or what you didn't get from that Q&A to solve your problem.
