Stop iPhone alerting me when I'm in a phone call <body> When I'm in a phone call, I still get alerts for emails and texts. The noise will play and, if the phone is on Speaker, it will vibrate -- often leading the person I'm talking to wonder what that weird noise was.  Surely there must be a way to silence the phone while you're talking on it. It's very distracting to have beepings going off right next to your ear!  <answer93603> Looks like there is no setting to silence alerts during a call.  https://discussions.apple.com/message/16904276#16904276     There's no phone setting to silence alerts during phone calls.  You   can suggest this to Apple: http://www.apple.com/feedback/iphone.html   <answer93801> download a silent ringtone. Set your phone alerts to this ring tone. its the only  way.  <answer93911> Set codeSettings &gt; Sounds &gt; Vibrate on Silent/code to strongOFF/strong; then while on the call you can flip the hardware switch to Silent. This will disable all sounds and vibration.  <answer193462> Quickest way to shut off text tone, or any other, is to tap volume up or down one click, this cancels tones. Also including when text tone wont stop after entering text from home screen (notifications) there's no need to play with the notifications setting all the time. You'll see others mention to reboot holding home and sleep simultaneously to do stop run-on tones, doesn't last or work most of the time.   <comment231672> This is indeed what I ended up doing. Sounds counter-intuitive, but it works best for me. Thanks.
