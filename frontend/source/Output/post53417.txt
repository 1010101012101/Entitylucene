How to disable the special characters shortcut (Cmd+Option+T) in OS X Lion? <body> I just want to use this shortcut for one other application.  <answer53430> Going to System Preferences and selecting Keyboard preferences, and then clicking on the Keyboard Shortcuts tab will show a list. If you select Keyboard &amp; Text Input, the shortcut (Cmd + Option + T) should be there, and just follow the directions to change it.  <answer53469> precodedefaults write -g NSUserKeyEquivalents -dict-add "Special Characters..." nul /code/pre  Or change the shortcut to something else in System Preferences: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/o6ifv.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment61152> Hi Tanner, the problem is there are no mention of a special characters's shortcut in "Keyboard & Text Input". These are mostly about moving focus... But thanks anyway, I discovered one new cool shortcut. <comment61153> Ah, I had forgotten. The comment below explains how. I didn't have access to a Mac at the time, but I knew it was somewhere in the system preferences. <comment64570> Setting a shortcut to nil is a great trick, certainly more elegant than setting it to some obscure key combo. Unfortunately, anything set to nil in the Keyboard Shortcuts gets reset to L when you restart. So a script to do this added to your login items can avoid any inconvenience. <comment64592> @CanuckSkier At least on my installation of 10.7 the shortcuts set to nul are shown as L in System Preferences (as in the screenshot), but they stay as nul on the property lists and pressing L doesn't trigger them. <comment64659> That's what I get as well, but I've had it revert on restarts to L actually triggering them. Perhaps there was a second factor causing this that I overlooked. <comment64728> @CanuckSkier I still can't reproduce that. A few applications like Audacity and Find Any File seem to think that menu items assigned to nul are assigned to N though. <comment64735> Interesting. I'll have to do some more testing then. Thanks for the feedback.
