El Capitan froze and rebooted (Macbook Pro Retina Mid 2012) <body> ul li2.3 Ghz Intel Core i7 8GB DDR3: Was running NetAdmin Pro which is monitoring  my office LAN, processors consumption was at  ~15 - 20%. Simultaneously I ran WiFI Explorer,  3.7% no more than 5% CPU usage. And I was  updating Xcode to v 7.3.1 and was browsing and  watching video from playground.ru/li liWatch the videos until half of it (20mins) the Video froze I moved the mouse and turned out  the whole OSX is frozen./li lilittleSnitch v 3.7 has no reaction/li liI immediately pull the Ethernet adaptor and  MacBook just went to black screen. I then  switch off the wireless router. (My MacBook Pro  is connected to the network via Ethernet  adaptor and via WiFi router bearing different IP, I was thinking of cutting both network  communication, in case it was an intrusion)/li liMacBook just restarted itself to login screen,  after 15-20 sec of black screen and total  silence)/li liI again restarted and booted into Recovery  mode use disk utility. After completing disk  check./li liLogin and previously opened programs resume  back (NetAdmin Pro, WiFi Explorer, Yandex  browser, Activity Monitor and AppStore)/li liAppStore doesn't resume the download  everything else is functioning normally and in Addition I have got my calendar open after login (I did not launch accidental nor was it set to  start with system login)/li /ul  Question 1: Are there any way to know what was happening and what was OS El Capitan last reaction before it froze and rebooted?  Question 2: Are there any software better than "Console" v10.11 to interpret what was going on before it crashes?  emP.S.

That is how Apple receives feedback from seeding/beta customers. The keyboard shortcut is kbdCmd/kbd kbdOpt/kbd kbdCtrl/kbd kbdShift/kbd kbdPeriod/kbd.   You can also run sudo codesysdiagnose -f ~/Desktop//code in Terminal. The former will save to code/var/tmp/code and the latter will save to the Desktop.   Sysdiagnose will contain pretty much A to Z.  You should be sure to check the disks.txt, diskutil.txt, errorlog.txt, logs.txt, and the diagnostics folder.  <answer244277> ol liThe combination of the model, video viewing(/discrete gpu usage) and the way it just respawned to the login screen makes me fairly certain it's a faulty GPU issue.

For example, a shutdown cause of 0 means that your Mac lost power.  An error code of 0 means that (the function) exited normally with no error.  Using this case as an example, *Error code -128" means emuser canceled/em, while emshutdown cause -128/em is undefined.  So, in the output you provided, you have 3 error codes:  3, 5, and  -128.  ul licause 3 is a "dirty" shutdown meaning that something was force quit and/or the power button was held down to power off the system/li licause 5 is a clean exit and there is nothing to worry about/li licause 128 is "undefined."  However, most of the time that I have run accros this has been either memory or the logic board  ul liShutdown Cause -128/li liMBP Retina 15 inch, late 2013 shuts down randomly/li /ul/li /ul  The best way to diagnose this is to run Apple Hardware Test (AHT) with one of your memory modules removed (Mid-2012 and earlier.  2013 and newer models have modules that cannot be removed).  Hold kbdD/kbd while booting from a powered off state with the AC adapter plugged in.  If your test comes out clean, shutdown, remove the module and replace it with the first one that you removed.  Re-run AHT.  <comment300964> Find out what the shutdown cause was by issuing the command `syslog | grep -i "shutdown cause"` and post the results.  You can also run Apple [Hardware Test (AHT)](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201257).  Hold down "D" while booting from a powered off state with AC adapter connected. <comment300966> while good advice, it's not an **answer** to the quesiton.  It's the first step in diagnosing. <comment300969> @Allan correct me if I'm wrong but I'm pretty sure it answers question 2. And I think it's an implied answer to question 1 that if he reads the sys diagnose, there's a way to know what went wrong. <comment300970> So, what does he look for? <comment300974> @Allan answer edited. You're right. My bad. <comment301005> Jun 27 13:05:58 DDT-2 kernel Chaleune  console                   Wed Jun 29 18:56   still logged in Chaleune  console                   Mon Jun 27 22:56 - crash (1+20:00) Chaleune  console                   Sun Jun 26 18:00 - 22:55 (1+04:54) Chaleune  console                   Sun Jun 26 12:09 - 12:50  (00:40) <comment301011> [Apple](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3128527?tstart=0) answers is not satisfactory. I did not have overheat, my fan works normally. Beside that I have cause 5 and 3. After replying to your message I re-run the command and now have -128. And the incident  was happening around 18:00 hrs Jun 29. <comment301012> [Opensource.apple](http://opensource.apple.com//source/CarbonHeaders/CarbonHeaders-18.1/MacErrors.h) shows the following - dsIllInstErr                  = 3,    /*illegal instruction error*/ - dsChkErr                      = 5,    /*check trap error*/  -   userCanceledErr               = -128 <comment301025> Shutdown codes are different that system errors.  However, a -128 is unidentified, but most of the time it's related to memory.  Pull out a module and run Apple Hardware Test.  Hold down D while booting from power off state with AC connected. <comment301029> Thank you @BoraOztekin, well I did as you have suggested, but how do I learn how to read/interpret what 'sysdiagnose' generated. It's way way too much of information for me. I was just wanted to understand the causes of today incidents and hopefully I could prevent it or at least avoid and not try to repeat the same mistakes. I have save the logs from the Console and will update it to the question. <comment301032> @Kuma I'm away from my laptop but I'll check out my sysdiagnose and follow up with some pointers later... <comment301066> rMBP has soldered memory, so can't exactly just take one of them out. <comment301068> Would those who downvoted this mind explaining why? My faulty rMBP behaved exactly like this, a _very_ significant proportion of first-gen rMBP's are suffering from this issue, and I explained how he can try to confirm this issue and get a free repair from Apple if it happens to be the case.  I also answered his second question about a better syslog reader, and lnav is definitely just that. <comment301069> I keep forgetting which year they went from modules to soldered RAM.  Either way, -128 is usually RAM and the 2nd link I provided was the exact same case as yours <comment301107> MBP did not restart after I chose 'Restart' command, instead it closes most of the interface leaving little snitch functional and unfunctional dock. I waited 20-25 mins then I cut the power. Booted into Recovery mode did disk firstaids then booted to AHT, chose extended test and result was PASSED. <comment301108> MBP Retina Mid 2012, I did AHT with extended test, result was PASSED. Sorry I couldn't take out any memory modules as I don't have the tools. (Last time I happen to ask some dealer if they could upgrade my SSD drive, they said it soldered and can't be upgraded. So this happen with the RAM too?) <comment301112> Thank you @tolgraven for your input, I haven't voted anyone anything yet, and I had like to have more clarification before I put all the causes to GPU. regarding "lnav" : ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"  /dev/null 2 /dev/null curl: (7) Couldn't connect to server <comment301118> Yeah, look into it and if it turns out to be plausible then Apple will still obviously do additional extended tests before replacing the logic board. re: brew I'm guessing you're still on your work network and it uses a proxy? Try adding --noproxy before "-fsSL" and see if it works, or just save the file using your browser and run it manually. <comment301126> You will probably have to run AHT multiple times since this is an intermittent problem <comment301241> Thank you for answering the 2nd question, I have got it running by downloading it (no installation). Now I was wondering if it could help me reads the saved *.logs, Kernel_2016-06-25-212600_DDT-2.gpuRestart, *.diag files that @Bora Oztekin suggested? (haven't have time to read the lnav.org yet, thanks in advance)
