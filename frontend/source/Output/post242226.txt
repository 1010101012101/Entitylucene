How can I add a property to the window object in Chrome using Applescript? <body> In Chrome's JavaScript Console, I can type the following:  precodewindow.myVar = "myValue"; /code/pre  I can then access codemyVar/code from the window context, where it returns code"myValue"/code. Excellent.  However, if I do the following in Applescript:  precodetell application "Google Chrome"     execute front window's active tab javascript "window.myVar = 'myValue';" end tell /code/pre  This execute statement appears to run when the script is called. No errors are thrown, and the Chrome window exists. But when I try to reference codemyVar/code from the window context, only codeundefined/code is ever returned. For testing purposes, I added in an alert statement after that declaration - the alert WILL fire, but codemyVar/code remains unset.  Now, in Safari, using codedo JavaScript/code with this same code works as if I'd typed the code directly into the console - codemyVar/code returns a value.  Why doesn't Chrome fire these statements when called by Applescript when it can be done manually? (Chrome 51.0.2704.84, OS X 10.11.5)  <answer242242> I discovered a workaround. Might not be the best, but the following line executes the JavaScript I have in mind while also setting properties of codewindow/code:  precodetell front window of application "Google Chrome"     set URL of active tab to "javascript:" &amp; window.myVar = "myValue" end tell /code/pre  Using this, codemyVar/code properly returns code"myValue"/code. Nice.
