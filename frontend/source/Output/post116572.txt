Delay when using the volume buttons <body> When I change the volume using the buttons on an Apple Wireless keyboard (with a Mac Mini) I almost have a huge delay between the key press and the action (up to several seconds and from time to time even several minutes).  ul liusing the slider on the menu works perfectly (without delay)/li liresetting the PRAM does not bring any improvement/li liI do not have any sound-related third party utility as boom (see an Apple Support discussion)/li /ul  Any idea what the cause could be?  strongEdit/strong  ul liBrightness is affected as well/li liI also noticed that the process codeloginwindow/code is not responding and uses 100% of one core/li liThe console shows no errors/li /ul  <answer141150> Do you have an APC UPS?  I was having this exact problem after upgrading to Mavericks yesterday, and found that force-quitting codeapcupsd/code (a UPS controller daemon) instantly removed the delay.  If this doesn't help then you could try force-quitting other third party daemons that perform similar tasks to codeapcupsd/code.  <answer191760> There is a bug in OSX 10.10.3 that makes the volume and brightness buttons depend on CPU/disk. A fresh install on new hardware under load will have this issue. Downgrading to 10.9.x, hoping 10.11 fixes it or installing Linux are the only solutions I am aware of. Apple had no comment.  <answer204642> Typing codesudo killall coreaudiod/code in the terminal fixed the issue straight away for me.  It also removed the delay on the keyboard brightness buttons. Issue started after going back to internal speakers after streaming audio through airport.   <answer244284> Killing coreaudio did not work for me.  But then I have noticed that this behavior happens when running Android Studio connecting to an Android device.  Apparently the ADB (Android Debug Bridge) has some conflict which causes sluggish behavior with the volume and screen brightness function keys.  strongSolution:/strong  Shut down Android Studio and disconnect the device.  Make sure that Android Transfer program is not running either (it'll show up in Activity Monitor).  Yeah, it's not an optimal solution, but it works for me.  I don't expect many of you to be Android programmers, but if you are, this just might be the fix you're looking for.  <answer278232> In your sound preferences go on the 'Sound Effects' tab and turn off 'Play feedback when volume is changed'.   This solved the delay for me. Seems it was taking a second to read the sound effect from disk each time.  <comment136361> I guess you get the same behaviour with the brightness ? <comment136362> @MatthieuRiegler I will check I almost never change it, at the moment they both work. I will wait a couple of hours and when the strange behavior comes back (it always does after a certain time) I will check if the brightness is also affected. <comment227871> The problem was there in 2014. 10.10 was not yet released. <comment228169> @Matteo, What version are you using now? Did you try a fresh install (without import)? <comment228170> Now I have a different OS but also a different machine ... <comment228173> @Matteo so you should probably delete the question if you can't test/evaluate answers. <comment266850> You may have to do `sudo killall coreaudiod` instead. (Note the different process name) <comment300890> What's the difference between `coreaudio` and `coreaudiod`? <comment300891> I'm seeing this issue as well.  Started happening yesterday.  Running 10.9.4 on iMac.  Disconcerting as I adjust my volume and brightness often to accommodate different programs. <comment301171> `coreaudiod` did it for me. Thanks. <comment303012> This should be accepted, worked for me as well <comment319073> Sometimes it just doesn't restart by itself, in that case just do: sudo `launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.audio.coreaudiod.plist` then  `sudo launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.audio.coreaudiod.plist` <comment350122> +1 I am not able to check since I no longer have the Mac Mini with the problem, but it seems a valid approach (the delay because of the disk could have been a problem). <comment361352> This didn't work for me. However restarting my computer did it for me. It had been running for 40 days. <comment364561> Didn't work immediately, but after a few seconds it was working
