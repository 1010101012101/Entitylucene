Mac OS unable to boot with CD after Ubuntu installed <body> I had an issue with the MAC OS and couldn't repair the MAC os i have (10.4) on my intel duo core macbook.  So i install Ubuntu 11 on my mac and works perfectly. I am selling my laptop now to get the new macbook pro but the person who wants it needs mac os but every time I try to install it shows a folder with a question mark when I put the mac cd strongem(Original CDs 10.4 that came with the laptop)/em/strong  so i booted with the "option" and shows my hard drive, put the mac CD and it ejects it, put the ubuntu CD and works perfectly.  I try to clear the nvram: Command + Option + O + F  nothing,  what can i do to install mac os?  <answer93223> Try clearing the SMC? https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4550751?start=0&amp;tstart=0 I don't know if your mac is new enough to have an option for resetting the SMC but you might give it a try, this is one of the well-known issues associated with having a messed up SMC.  Unless your Mac is PPC and quite old, the command-option-O-F summons an open firmware prompt (which most people use to reset thing) and not a NVRAM/PRAM reset. For that you need command-option-P-R which sets a few variables to their default values.  <answer93421> try to take the dvd out of the question. there might be something wrong either with the disk or the dvd-drive that doesnt allow you to install  make a bootable usb stick as per the following instructions from a friends mac  with a more current osx http://www.maciverse.com/install-boot-os-x-leopard-from-a-usb-flash-drive.html  and then try the "option" press while booting to choose where to boot from...  Here is also a guide on how to do this (install the osx from a USB) for osx 10.4 btw  install boot osx 10.4 from usb drive  <answer93427> h2Hint/h2  kbdCommand/kbd-kbdOption/kbd-kbdO/kbd-kbdF/kbd alone, immediately after the startup sound:   ul lipresents an Open Firmware prompt, only on Macs that use Open Firmware/li lidoes strongnot/strong reset NVRAM./li /ul  At an Open Firmware prompt you emmight/em enter a command such as codereset-nvram/code – but it's not the usual approach.   h1Advice/h1  Use kbdCommand/kbd-kbdOption/kbd-kbdP/kbd-kbdR/kbd as instructed in Apple's article: About NVRAM and PRAM.  h2Additional advice/h2  If the optical disc is loaded whilst the Mac is powered off, then kbdC/kbd – pressed immediately after the startup sound, and held – should allow the Mac to boot from a compatible disc.   If the kbdC/kbd key approach does not work – and if you have reset NVRAM/PRAM – then consider the possibility of a marginal optical drive and/or marginal disc.

Maybe the CD is scratched, dirty or broken? <comment109346> @Nicholaz Yes the CD is readable, I am able to read it from my other Ubuntu machine using HFS mount, I can see all its content and read files. Also can boot from another MAC I have no problem. <comment109349> Weird. Can you make a clone of the CD (preferably on another computer) and see if the clone boots? <comment109352> @Nicholaz Oh didn't think about that, let me try <comment109353> It's just a desperate attempt, but maybe worth the blank CD :-) <comment109411> @Nicholaz same thing, clone the CD same results <comment109550> [Chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/9797657#9797657); and consider editing some of the commentary into the question … <comment109561> I wonder if you could edit in the exact marketing name of your Mac in case the open firmware reset is relevant. <comment109565> @bmike and how would I do that? <comment109568> http://apple.com/support/manuals has a list of all Mac hardware and you click the edit button to add that detail to the body of the question. <comment109717> I would disagree with the characterization that a SMC that needs reset would cause one OS to boot but another OS to not boot. It could be an edge case, but I'd focus more on the OS that isn't booting than the system (which works with the alternate OS) or the alternate OS (which works with the system). <comment109791> I tried to press C and it works for a Ubuntu DVD/CD but not for the Mac DVD. The MAC DVD works for my other macbook pro. So I don't think the CD is broken nor the drive since I can read the Ubuntu DVD <comment109917> The person you are selling to *needs* or *wants* Mac OS? Maybe you can tell him/her Ubuntu is good too, if he/she doesn't need any MacOS specific applications <comment109998> @com.BOY she does not want to install wine for photoshop, and other tools like this <comment109999> Ok. She also can't use alternatives like GIMP? <comment110014> @com.BOY ... lol you funny! <comment110021> @PatREllery What? :) <comment110065> @com.BOY Gimp as alternative? no comments ... what about indesign? illustrator? maya? <comment110074> @PatREllery I'm not saying that's always an option, I was just suggesting that it's maybe good enough for her. But looks like it isn't.
