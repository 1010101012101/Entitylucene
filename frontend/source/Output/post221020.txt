Large zip files created in OS X cannot be opened in Windows <body> When I compress a large directory in OS X, like 5-6 GB the resulting archive cannot be browsed in Windows / Total Commander. It hangs the app and stays at 100% cpu usage, like its trying to extract it or something. Does anybody know whats causing this? Smaller zips that have like 2-3 GB can be browsed instantly.  <comment267587> Probably something to do with the inability of the tools on the Windows side to handle files bigger than 4 GB. Unless you also have problems unpacking these files on OS X, you might get better answers on a Windows-focused site (or maybe on superuser.com). <comment267588> It's not just TC. Windows Explorer says the zip file is invalid. I tried creating the zip with TC, but then the zip file cannot be opened by "The Unarchiver" app on OS X. Then I tried the 7-zip program and the ZIP file created by it can be browsed in TC and gives no errors in "The Unarchiver". So I guess the 7-zip program is the way to go, but I'm still wondering what's up with those zip files created by OS X <comment267590> Another weird thing is that "The Unarchiver"  takes much longer to extract those OS X zips. It gives a "Preparing..." message first, then after a long time it begins extracting. Expanding them with double click is much quicker. There's def something wrong with how Mac compresses large folders <comment268371> I've seen this issue as well. Eventually just ended up making a few zip files to transfer the data I needed. <comment328742> Just experienced such a problem: 7GB file zipped on Mac OS X. Another Mac can uncompress it, but on Linux, `unzip -l` or `7z l` give errors. The same file compressed on Windows or Linux does not have this problem.
