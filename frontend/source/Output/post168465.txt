When Does the "Storage Almost Full" Message Appear? <body> I am trying to find what causes the "Storage Almost Full" message to appear on iOS. For example, is it:  ul liLess than a specific number of Mb of storage is available (if so, how many Mb?)/li liLess than a specific percentage of storage is available/li liDoes it vary across device hardware / iOS versions?/li /ul  My reason for asking is that I am trying to maximize the amount of content that I can load onto a device before I see the message.
