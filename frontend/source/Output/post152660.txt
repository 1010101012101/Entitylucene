What are Airport scan requests? <body> I have a lot of logging noise that seems to be malignant, and doesn't scream "problem" when I look at it. It is just so frequent that it's almost endless, and that it's related to wireless networking I'd like to know what it means (for various reasons like security or battery life...).  Being network related I disabled Bluetooth, and with the Thunderbolt Bridge changed the strongConfigure IPv4/strong setting to codeOff/code. I think it's safe to say all of these messages happen while I'm connected to a trusted network.  What is the meaning of this information that the software engineers decided was worth logging?  h2System info/h2  precodeHardware Overview:   Model Name:   MacBook Pro   Model Identifier:

In reviewing the log, it seems to do it in earnest for a minute, then slow down for several minutes, then pick back up. I'm not sure why it is doing it so often, but as long as your battery life does not seem to be suffering and the system is not slowing during these periods, I wouldn't worry about it.  <comment179705> Not sure why it is occurring once a second (or more) but a scan request would be scanning for available networks. <comment179706> Thanks, @tubedogg. Also strange that it does it even though I'm always connected to one. <comment179709> BTW, if that's really what the messages mean, that's all I'm looking for as far as an answer. <comment179718> My battery life is disappointing, but I'd be wise to simply stop using Google Chrome before tweaking the system. ;) <comment205949> I noticed Yosemite spamming the log as soon as I plugged the power chord. As soon as it was plugged in the messages stop. I guess this is a "oh the power is off, let's drain the battery"-approach. One of the many Yosemite improvements.
