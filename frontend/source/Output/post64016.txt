Network share permissions problems in Mountain Lion <body> After upgrading to Mountain Lion, I have experienced some weird problems with network share permissions.  This network share is a Windows server which I login to like so: codesmb://DOMAIN;USERNAME@networkshare.address/folder/code  h2What I see/h2  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RQl6b.png" alt="Permissions error in TextEdit when saving on network share"  h2What I cannot do/h2  ul liCreate a new file and save directly to the share./li liOpen an existing file and save my changes./li /ul  h2What I can do/h2  ul liCreate new folder/li liDelete folders and files/li liRename folders and file/li liMove folders and files/li liDrag and drop from my desktop to the share drive/li /ul  h2Apps that ignore the "problem"/h2  With these programs, I am able to save new file into the share drive and overwrite changes to an existing file.  ul liAdobe CS6: Photoshop, Illustrator, Dreamweaver, etc/li liMicrosoft Office: Word, Excel, etc/li /ul  h2Apps that display the permissions error message/h2  With most (all?) Mac apps, the permissions error presents itself in some form or fashion.  ul liTextEdit, Preview/li liPages, Numbers, Keynote/li liCoda 2/li /ul  Coda 2 is unique in that it will let me "Replace" the file, but clicking "Save" will not work.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SQxXV.png" alt="Permissions error in Coda 2 when saving on network share"  h2What else have I tried?/h2  ul liI have Repaired the Home Directory and Permissions and ACLs/li liMy IT department has confirmed I have all read/write access to the share drive and has even gone so far as to reapply the permissions to every single folder and file/li liI have connected via codecifs/code and by using the IP address of the server/li liI have joined the domain via the Users and Groups pref pane (all this does is not ask for your network login anymore when connecting to the share)/li liI have confirmed with other coworkers this affects them as well (some with Lion, some with Mountain Lion)/li liI have checked the "Ask to keep changes when closing documents" option in the General pref pane/li /ul  As you can see, this is weird.  My IT department suggested I wipe my computer.  strikeI don't see how that would have any affect and is really a last resort.  I'm hoping someone here can shed light on this before I move forward with that./strike Wiping the machine and reinstalling the OS doesn't help.  Word is that it has something to do with ACLs.  <comment100732> This is not an answer to your question, but I have a very similar (but somewhat different) issue copying files to a Lion 10.7 share. If I get any responses, they may be helpful to you. See http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/87076/cannot-save-edit-to-mac-share-using-mountain-lion. <comment100756> This is a classic POSIX/ACL conflict from my experience. Is it a Mac Server? I'm guessing ACLs haven't been set from server side properly. Wiping your Mac will not fix it. When ACLs are not set on a file share individual files will maintain their own unique permissions based on which group member created the file. I had several issues like this with my first Mac Server I setup and applying ACLs fixed it. If you can provide more info on how the server is configured I may be able to provide more detail, but suffice it to say your Mac is not the problem here.
