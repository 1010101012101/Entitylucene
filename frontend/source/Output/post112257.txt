Boot to SATA drive in other computer? <body> I have a MacBook Pro that does not seem to be booting. If I were to take the hard drive and put it in another computer an select that in the BIOS, would it boot (if the hardware between the two computers are different?  <answer112283> Yes, it will boot in another Mac.  <comment132126> Great that it can boot in a mac, but will it boot in a Dell? <comment132214> No, it will not boot in a Dell.
