Is there a way to not require a password for login when I am at home but still require one everywhere else <body> I am looking for a way to automatically login to my computer when waking from sleep/startup when I am at my home/connected to my home wifi; but when for example I am at school or not connected to my home wifi require a password.  I am running El Capitan 10.11 Beta (15A278b) on a MacBook Pro (Retina 15 inch mid-2015)  <answer222525> I’ve configured my system to do something similar to what you are trying to do. While I personally never disable my login password (I never recommend doing it for several reasons) I do change some of my security settings for my local home network vs. when I’m away from home.  First, you will  want to get and install ControlPlane (which I have NOT tested with El Capitan). This add-on will let you change a bunch of settings on your Mac based on the location information that it can glean from "evidence sources”.  It also has a bunch of built in functions, is AppleScriptable, and open source.  Once you have ControlPlane installed you will need to create an AppleScript that will let you disable or enable password login based on the location information.  The AppleScript you create may be different depend on which Mac OS you are running (in your case El Capitan). But it will be similar to the script I created on OS X 10.9.5 to do what you want.  strongNOTE 1:/strong This scrip only toggles the settings found on the Security &amp; Privacy Page, it does NOT have any understanding of the location information. You will probably want to create a version of this AppleScript for each location that ControlPlane identifies, and have it change the settings accordingly.  strongNOTE 2/strong: This script require the user to enter their administrative password twice when disabling the password login and screensaver settings. I don’t know of a way around this unless you want to drop down and do shell scripting from ControlPlane, or add your password into the AppleScript and have it type it in for you. brbrstrongI DO NOT GUARANTEE OR WARRANTY THIS SCRIPT!
