I don't understand why. <comment313170> Yes.  I found and read that.  However, as I have been saying, the Option/Arrow function no longer works on my program.  Any suggestions on how to fix this? <comment313171> Have you installed any kind of 'keyboard commander' software recently? BetterTouch, Karabiner, 3rd party mouse/keyboard drivers etc? Also specifically what machine & OS? <comment313174> Have you try reinstalling Word? <comment313191> Have you verified that your Option button works as it should?  For instance, go to the File Menu of any application.  When you see the drop down, press the Option button.  You should see some different options appear.  Same goes for the arrow.... <comment313929> Check your Keyboard Shortcuts in System Preferences to see that there has not been a key combination set that conflicts.
