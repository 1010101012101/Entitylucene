Convert *stereo* .mov to mono .mp3? <body> I need an easy way to take a stereo .mov file and convert it to a mono .mp3 or similar formatted audio file.  I use Ecamm's Skype Call recorder to record interviews, which I send out for transcription. The call recorder creates an .mov file with 2 channels--one for each side of the call. The transcription software only plays one channel, so the audio sounds like it's one sided.  I do this a lot, so I'd like a simple, one-step way to merge the channels and convert the file.  I've tried ffmpeg, which I like, but I'm only getting one channel when I do this:   precodeffmpeg -i call.mov -ac 1 call.mp3 /code/pre  Any suggestions? I'd like to use ffmpeg if possible, but a GUI app would be fine as long as it's pretty simple to use.  <answer187310> Max (freeware) can drop stereo to mono - though I'm not certain if it will take .mov as input (never tested it). You might need to convert it to a distinct audio format first.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UzwQl.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment221331> Dang, looks like it can't handle .mov files. Thanks for the suggestion, though! <comment221343> if ffmpeg can get it over to any type of stereo audio, Max could do the rest. 2-step, but unless someone finds a free alternative... <comment221363> If I can get it into a stereo audio format, ffmpeg can handle merging the channels. So the problem is really going from stereo video to mono audio. <comment221372> ahh, right, I see. Sorry, other than high-end pro-audio stuff [I do music to picture for a living, but using appropriately costly tools], then it's not something I've tried. Wish you luck, though :) <comment221394> I don't have a .mov file around to try, but [this](http://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html#Advanced-options) might help
