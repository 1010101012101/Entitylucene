All I get in iTunes is codeiTunes could not connect to this iPhone. An unknown error occured (0xE8000084)/code  I've tried Googling for this error and no one else seems to have it.  <answer291518> This issue is because the iPhone 3GS isn't compatible with the newer iTunes software. I've been trying for ages and the only option I have come across so far is to take the phone to an Apple Store. I have tried everything. I have tried calling apple, chatting with them online and I have even tried to download an old version of iTunes but nothing works. Maybe give apple a call and see if they can give you any advice. Probably will tell you to take the phone into the store  <comment79164> Have you reset the iPhone to a factory-fresh state? <comment374046> Can you give a source outside of your own experience?
