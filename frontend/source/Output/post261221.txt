Troubleshooting WiFi issues <body> I am running El Capitan 10.11.6 and I'm experiencing a lot of WiFi issues lately. The 2.5ghz wifi of my modem has stopped working, whenever I try to join it it says: codeThe Wi-Fi network "office" could not be joined/code  However, I've been using this wifi network for a long time - nothing has been changed on this network. From a different laptop I can join this.  Then I switched over to the 2.4ghz wifi, same story. However, after a little while my browser wont load any new data, everything that uses internet just stops working, but the wifi stays connected.  When I reconnect my wifi, it just works for a little while. Same story after.  I havent seen this issue anywhere on the internet, I've googled a lot. I am unsure what the issue is, it seems to be related to my macbook as other devices have no issues with the wifi at all.  Any way I can troubleshoot this?  <comment327126> Go to System Preferences  Network  Advanced ... button and in your list of Preferred Networks, select your wifi network and click the minus [-] button. Then reconnect to your network.    About that list of Preferred Networks: delete as many networks in the list you care to. Lastly, make sure to drag your network to the top of the list.
