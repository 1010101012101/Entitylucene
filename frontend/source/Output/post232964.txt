MySQL fails to start after update <body> I am on Yosemite 10.10.5 and just now I updated my outdated MySQL to the latest version. I made a copy of my existing databases /usr/local/mysql/data/ somewhere safe.  I have tried to setup MySQL both via brew &amp; via the package installer, but seems I managed to mess up with both ways.   There is a new icon in preferences panel that was created via the package installer but it doesn't seem to start MySQL.   I tried running emmysql.server start/em on terminal but i received the following error:  precodeStarting MySQL . ERROR! The server quit without updating PID file (/usr/local/var/mysql/myname.local.pid). /code/pre  I tried embrew services start mysql/em and I get:  precode==&gt; Successfully started `mysql` (label: homebrew.mxcl.mysql) /code/pre  But I can't access to it via Sequel Pro or via Terminal. Since brew services starts mysql, I try emmysql/em but I get:   precodeERROR 2002 (HY000): Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/tmp/mysql.sock' (2) /code/pre  I have the following logs at em/usr/local/var/mysql/myname.local.err/em  precode2016-03-30T21:58:53.6NZ mysqld_safe Starting mysqld daemon with databases from /usr/local/mysql/data 2016-03-30T21:58:53.791807Z 0 [Warning] TIMESTAMP with implicit DEFAULT value is deprecated.

Solution for me was to remove mysql completely &amp; reinstalled it via brew.  The new database data i created are located in code/usr/local/var/mysql//code  Running where mysql returns code/usr/local/bin/mysql/code  Running mysql.server start|stop|restart seems to function ok. Also accessing db via sequel pro works ok but when i tried to setup my rails projects i run rake db:create but i received     rake aborted!

Plus my data where on mysql no mariadb, so in case i do so will i be able to migrate my backup db from mysql to mariadb? <comment284868> AFAIR homebrew uses mariadb - it's still called mysql though (mariadb is the "successor" of mysql) <comment284914> @klanomath mariadb is not installed in my setup. I am also missing my.cnf , doesnt exist in /etc/ or /usr/local/mysql/ <comment284945> Sometimes I managed to get around errors like this by deleting .err files in `/usr/local/var/mysql/` and starting MySQL. <comment284981> hi @pietrodn i deleted all *.err files in /usr/local/var/mysql/ . There is one thats keeps regenerating (myuser.local.err) and here is the latest logs i found in it http://pastebin.com/qCs10fJQ <comment285249> Seems a more serious issue than mine... googling the error message that you get, it could be a permissions problem. You could try executing the chmod and chgrp commands suggested here: http://superuser.com/a/660087/169518 <comment285532> Your first sentence is the problem -Homebrew uses /usr/local so noting else can -  the paths are correct <comment285568> Hi @Mark,  i removed mysql completely & reinstalled it from scratch via brew. The problem is that some path or rv mor rails is looking for an older version of libmysqlclient. Any idea how to resolve this?
