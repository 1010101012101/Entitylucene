How can I prevent stuck keys when VNC into OS X El Capitan loses focus? <body> emtl;dr: I'd like to avoid OS X thinking the [Command] key is being held down when I [Alt][Tab] away from a Windows TightVNC session, or at least get the [Command] key to auto-release after a period of time./em  I'm using TightVNC on a Windows 8 x64 box to access a Mac OS X El Capitan box through standard built-in OS X Screen Sharing.  The combination works great for my purposes, with one exception: when TightVNC has focus and I hit [Alt][Tab] on the Windows box to switch focus to another application, the OS X understandably sees the [Alt] key go down, but never come back up.  Because the Windows [Alt] key maps to the OS X [Command] key, the OS X box is left thinking I never released the [Command] key.  Therefore, when I return to the TightVNC session a minute, hour, or month later and begin typing, the results are often surprising and sometimes bad, because OS X still thinks the [Command] key is depressed.  Is there a way I can avoid this situation without relying on changing my habits, which hasn't yet worked out for me after a year of occasionally getting burned by this? :)  I'm thinking the a good approach would be something running under OS X that watches for the [Command] key being depressed for several seconds, and forcibly "unsticks" it.  Such a gimmick wouldn't create any problems for my workflow, but I don't know of a way to accomplish it.  <comment292740> I hate to be the annoying guy who comments with a "me too!", but this frustrated me so incredibly that I feel obligated to explain for other victims. This is exactly what was happening to me; I was using VNC to remote into my Mac from Windows and Alt-Tabbed away, and then it drove me insane when I couldn't type on the top-row of numbers on a U.S. keyboard, nor could I type a period (fullstop). I closed and reopened the VNC client and the result was the same. It wasn't until I restarted the Mac and found your post that I realized what was happening. THANK YOU. So, what do we do to prevent this?
