Which version of Mac OS X was the first to support RTL (right-to-left) languages? <body> Apple – Press Info – Mac OS X Hits Stores This Weekend (2001) listed seven languages for 10.0. From an archived Apple knowledge base article Mac OS X 10.6: Changing the direction of text I know that Snow Leopard included support for right-to-left emand/em bidirectional text. From the knowledge base:      … When using certain right-to-left writing systems such as Arabic, Hebrew, Yiddish, Persian, Pashto, and Urdu, you may need to quote words from left-to-right writing systems, such as English. When right-to-left text is mixed with left-to-right text, it is called bidirectional text. …   However:   ul liI can't tell which version of the operating system introduced support for RTL. /li /ul  Apple - Mac OS X Snow Leopard - Technical specifications doesn't list Arabic or Hebrew amongst the languages, so (by implication) whilst emoperating system localisations/em at that time did not include those languages, the OS did support RTL.   Another archived article, Hebrew &amp; Arabic Language Kit: System Direction Issues, reminds me that for less recent versions of the OS, Apple's installer offered language kits (more recent installers include those languages by default).    hr  I tried searching domains such as mellel.com, redlers.com and www.apple.com/pr – e.g. https://duckduckgo.com/?q=languages%20%22Mac%20OS%20X%22%20site:www.apple.com/pr/ – couldn't find an answer.   If it helps: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mellel states that development of Mellel began in 2002 (and I recall Mellel being renowned for RTL support).   <answer176820> It was introduced in 10.2, Jaguar, and greatly improved in 10.3, Panther. See this article from MacOSXHints for evidence and more details.  <answer176827> I think Apple support for RTL may go back to OS 7.1:  See  http://www.macintouch.com/m85_multilingual.html  It was definitely part of OS 9/Classic.  For more info see my old page here:  https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/46870715/s/jmlingos9.html  As Mike Scott mentioned, RTL was missing in 10.0 and 10.1.  <comment208903> Thanks! In retrospect, it's odd that none of the following mention language: [Apple Introduces “Jaguar,” the Next Major Release of Mac OS X](https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2002/07/17Apple-Introduces-Jaguar-the-Next-Major-Release-of-Mac-OS-X.html) (2002-07-17); [Apple – Mac OS X – Jaguar](http://web.archive.org/web/20020802214804/http://www.apple.com/macosx/jaguar/); [Apple Announces Mac OS X “Panther”](https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2003/10/08Apple-Announces-Mac-OS-X-Panther.html) (2003-10-08). <comment208907> OK … reputation to @mike-scott for the strictly correct answer to this question (about Mac OS X) … plus, I'll bounty this answer for satisfying my curiosity about Classic. Incidentally, *Unleash Your Multilingual Mac* is also [in the Internet Archive Wayback Machine](http://web.archive.org/web/20120530165828/http://homepage.mac.com/thgewecke/jmlingos9.html). Thank you both! <comment208918> I think they might have been embarrassed that the first versions of OS X were not as capable as either OS 9 or Win XP in this area and did not consider catching up to them as something worth trumpeting. <comment208919> @Graham Thanks much for the wayback info
