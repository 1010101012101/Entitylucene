Is it possible to boot an installed partition through Virtual Machines? <body> My native Mac OS partition has Mavericks installed. I created another partition and made a fresh install of Yosemite on it.  Is it possible to boot the Yosemite partition in a Virtual Machine or is there any other way to run Mavericks and Yosemite simultaneously?  <comment224855> As long as your VM client can find the partition, yes, it is possible. <comment224857> Which client do you suggest? <comment224858> I've used Oracle VM Virtualbox for running Linux images, I don't know how it responds with an Yosemite image.
