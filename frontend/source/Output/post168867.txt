How can I find out the temperature of my Macbook Pro? <body> Is there a built-in way to find out the temperature of my Macbook Pro?   <answer168875> OS X does not offer this functionality. smcFanControl and the iStat widgets are the typical go-to choices for this issue. I personally use smcFanControl. It gives me both the temperature and the ability to monitor fan operation.  <answer228210> https://github.com/nicolargo/glances  This one on python has auto-update &amp;&amp; colors built-in and can be installed with a simple curl or wget command if requirements are already met.

You may have to scroll around a bit to find the most recent version, but it's free (always has been, no piracy here) and IMO is overall better than Menus even though it's not supported.
