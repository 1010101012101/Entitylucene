How to run a JAR from another directory using a script <body> I created a script file em/Users/rodrigo/Desktop/run_jar.command/em and chmod'ed it to make it runnable from Finder. I want the script to run a JAR from another directory. The script is:  precodecd /Users/rodrigo/Dropbox/ java -jar program.jar /code/pre  But I get:     /Users/rodrigo/Desktop/run_jar.command: line 1: cd: /Users/rodrigo/:   No such file or directorye/   I need to run the JAR from the Dropbox directory, because the JAR saves files as it runs and I need these in the Dropbox directory. strongHow can I solve this?/strong
