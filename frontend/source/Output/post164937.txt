Ignoring Autocorrect on Pages? <body> On Pages, how do I ignore an autocorrect suggestion? I use the esc key to ignore the suggestion, but as soon as I press space bar it changes the word anyway.   <answer164939> Open Pages as usual then go to the strongEdit/strong menu:  Scroll down to strongSpelling and Grammar/strong submenu and disable strongCorrect Spelling Automatically/strong.   Additionally you can disable strongCheck Spelling While Typing/strong.
