Problem with downloading songs for free <body> I am a new user to I-phone, I wanted to download MP3 and MP4 from You Tube or other internet provider to my I-Phone 5, to be use as my ringtones for free. is there any apps that we can download and do not need to pay.   I have downloaded many apps from the Apps store that is supposed to be free, but when you start using, we will need to buy the apps otherwise we cannot use. Guess it is free for downloading the apps only, when you want to use, you got to pay.   What I do now, is to download the music to my computer and look for a converter to transfer the files into I-tunes, then only synchronize with my I-phone to download the MP3 or MP4 music. This is too troublesome, too many steps just to download a song.  Please advice if there are any better solution or apps that I can use to make ringtone creation easier.   <answer119788> While I'm not a fan of pirating or stealing music, you can obtain certain YouTube soundtracks by using FlvTo. It allows you to put a YouTube link in the field provided and will create a MP3 as an output. Do this on a computer, import the song to iTunes, and sync it to your iPhone using iTunes. Of course, if you want the best quality and less hassle, just buy the ringtones. It's easy and the companies aren't asking for much. Just 99Â¢ a pop.  <comment134893> Is this not piracy?
