The volume primary SSD could not be repaired <body> My machine is not starting after progress bar. I'm trying to find the problem by booting in single user mode.   I tried code/sbin/fsck -fy/code   It showed me  codeMissing directory record (id = 33899953)/code  codeThe volume Primary SSD could not be repaired/code   <answer277215> Boot to Recovery HD, open in the menubar Utilities  Terminal. Enter codedf/code to get the name of your main volume (e.g. "Macintosh HD").  Enter codediskutil verifyVolume /Volumes/Vol_name/code (e.g. codediskutil verifyVolume "/Volumes/Macintosh HD"/code).  Then repair the volume with codediskutil repairVolume /Volumes/Vol_name/code.  If no main volume is mounted try codediskutil list/code, determine the disk identifier of the main volume (e.g. disk0s2) and first enter codediskutil verifyDisk /dev/disk0/code and repair it if necessary with codediskutil repairDisk /dev/disk0/code, then codediskutil verifyVolume /dev/disk0s2/code and repair it with codediskutil repairVolume /dev/disk0s2/code.  If your SSD has a CoreStorage Logical Volume Group  codediskutil repairDisk /dev/disk0/code should already repair everything.  If this fails you usually have to use some third-party software like DiskWarrior to repair the volume or restore a (Time Machine-)backup.  <comment348934> On running `df` it showed me following http://4.1m.yt/48uuHrG.jpg <comment348935> @Freddy Answer updated <comment348938> For each of them it shows `The volume 176 .... 0E appears to be OK`  and `File system check exit code is 0` <comment348939> @Freddy Already tried to boot to your main system volume again? <comment348940> Yes but that doesn't work....should I try repair? <comment348941> @Freddy If `diskutil verifyDisk/verifyVolume ...`s' exit codes are zero, you are left with the last two options: DiskWarrior or restore a backup...
