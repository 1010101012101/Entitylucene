Can two 500 GB external hard drives be used like a single 1 TB hard drive to use for Time Machine? <body> My new internal hard drive is 1 TB.  <answer261450> Depending on your system there are several methods to "concatenate" two or more external drives.  ul liRAID0: codediskutil createRAID stripe TMRAID JHFS+ disk1 disk2/code/li liJBOD: codediskutil createRAID concat TMRAID JHFS+ disk1 disk2/code/li liCoreStorage: codediskutil cs create disk1s2 disk2s2/code. A CoreStorage Logical Volume has to be created addtionally./li liZFS: This requires the additional installation of software. Link to Time Machine setup./li liMHDDFS: This requires the additional installation of software. ~Setup link (I didn't test this solution as a Time Machine destination)./li /ul  At the time of writing the new APFS (available in Sierra) apparently doesn't support Time Machine backups.  hr  None of these solutions is recommended as Time Machine destination volume.  ul liThe survival probability of the 500 GB drives (I assume they are at least 3 years old) is low compared to a new single drive./li liSince both drives are attached externally (via USB, FW etc.) the mechanical handling is error prone. If you detach any of the two drives accidentally while in use, you may loose the whole content because the volume usually is not recoverable afterwards./li /ul  I recommend to get a new single external drive (2 TB - 4 TB) which also provides some additional space to "breathe".  <comment327340> Sure! You may pool/union the 2 external drives (CoreStorage, RAID, MHDDFS, maybe ZFS) all with the downside of a higher probability of failure. But how is this related to your new internal 1 TB drive? <comment327341> My TB hard drive will probably get filled before the end of the year.  I want to make sure I can back it all up to both 500 GB hard drives. <comment327343> I would rather get a new 2-4 TB external drive to provide sufficient space to "breathe". 2 x 500 GB drives (probably at least 3 years old) have a somehow low [survival probability](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/226527/93229).
