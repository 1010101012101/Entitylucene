Battery of my Mac with Problems <body> When I charge my MacBook the battery goes only up to 99% and doesn't reach 100%. Is this something to worry about and if yes, how do I fix it?  <answer168241> To determine the Battery status open About this Mac -More -System  now look for battery information in there under Power.  Look for:  Charge cycles count &lt; 600 for yours  and the Full Charge Capacity (mAh):  4557  In any case resetting your SMC (System Management Controller will help some).  <comment197431> how OLD is your Battery on your Mac? <comment197432> well  my mac is mid 2012, so the battery has the same time. <comment197434> Does it show "service" or "Replace" battery when you click on the icon. <comment197530> Please stick to one question per post.
