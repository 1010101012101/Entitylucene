Messages.app on mac: search in history <body> i've a problem, i'm able to search for string in messages.app. It actually tells me all the matches for every conversation, the problem is that is shows only the last match, how can i go through all the results?  <answer140286> Have you tried Spotlight Search?   Cmnd + Space  Make sure Messages is enabled for Spotlight Search in your Mac System Preferences.  <answer140325> You can simply use  ul likbd⌘/kbd + kbdG/kbd in order to jump to the next occurrence/li /ul  and  ul likbd⌘/kbd + kbdShift/kbd + kbdG/kbd in order to jump to the previous one./li /ul  <comment274382> You're a godsend. Special thanks to Apple for applying the very least intuitive search key... <comment354282> I would suggest an edit: remove 'simply' :p
