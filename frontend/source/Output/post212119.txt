Some items could not be downloaded from the Store <body> While I was restoring my iPhone from iCloud backup, I got a message:      Restore Incomplete - Some items could not be downloaded from the Store. If they are on your computer, you can restore them by syncing with iTunes.   I understand that this can happen when the apps that were installed on my iPhone in the past are no longer available on App Store. All I want to know is which apps were not able to downloaded from the store. Is there any way that I can see the list of the apps that couldn't be downloaded in this restore?  I haven't backup the phone on my computer for years. I also have a developer account and XCode, if it concerns.  <comment256284> Have you tried looking at Updates-Purchased-Not on this Phone? <comment256292> @StephenCollins I have. There are just too many apps in that list because I've used iPhone more than 6 years. And I believe that the list wouldn't show the apps that are no longer on the App Store.
