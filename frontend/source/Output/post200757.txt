How can I assign an application to all desktops using the keyboard? <body> I know I can assign an application to 'All Desktops', 'This Desktop', or 'None' by right clicking it in the Dock.   I'd like to be able to toggle the current application between 'All Desktops' and 'None' using a keyboard shortcut.  Is there a way to achieve this, preferably without GUI scripting?  <answer200764> Here's a solution that emdoes/em use GUI scripting:  In Automator, create a Service. Use the 'Run AppleScript' action, with the AppleScript below. Then, in Services Preferences, you can assign a keyboard shortcut to the service.  precodeon run     -- get active application     tell application "System Events" to set activeApp to name of first application process whose frontmost is true      -- right click that application in the dock     tell application "System Events" to tell UI element activeApp of list 1 of process "Dock"         perform action "AXShowMenu"         click menu item "Options" of menu 1          -- is it currently checked?         set isChecked to value of attribute "AXMenuItemMarkChar" of menu item "All Desktops" of menu 1 of menu item "Options" of menu 1 as string          -- toggle between "None" and "All Desktops"         if (isChecked = "âœ“") then             perform action "AXShowMenu"             click menu item "Options" of menu 1             click menu item "None" of menu 1 of menu item "Options" of menu 1         else             perform action "AXShowMenu"             click menu item "Options" of menu 1             click menu item "All Desktops" of menu 1 of menu item "Options" of menu 1         end if      end tell end run /code/pre  Potential caveats:  ul liIt's slow/li liIt briefly flashes the dock options menu/li liIt will stop working if the UI changes/li liSometimes (but very inconsistently, not all the time), I'm prompted to allow either the current application OR Automator to control the computer.
