Use specific local gcc and related libraries with Homebrew <body> I would like to use Homebrew to install some stuff,  In the mean time, I have already installed my local gcc, and I want Homebrew to use this specific one (this gcc at code/usr/local/bin/gcc/code is frequently upgraded by myself).  Unfortunately, Homebrew always figure out its gcc dependency, and related libraries, then download them all at code/usr/local/Cellar/code.  For instance:  On my Mac, codewhich gcc/code indeed points to code/usr/local/bin/gcc/code, when I codebrew install suite-sparse/code, it downloads gcc-4.9.1, while I already have gcc-4.9.2 locally.  I just want to keep things simple, use my local gcc with the associated library, e.g. gmp and mpfr (at code/usr/local/lib/code), is it possible with Homebrew?  <answer173915> No, it's not possible. When you install codegcc/code, you must satisfied the required dependencies, otherwise this packages will be installed to ensure that works property.  precodeRequired: gmp ✔, libmpc ✘, mpfr ✘, cloog ✘, isl ✘ /code/pre  Same occurs on linux system, you can install codegcc/code without it's dependencies:  precodeDepends: cpp-4.8 (= 4.8.2-19ubuntu1), gcc-4.8-base (= 4.8.2-19ubuntu1), binutils (&gt;= 2.24), libgcc-4.8-dev (= 4.8.2-19ubuntu1), libc6 (&gt;= 2.14), libcloog-isl4 (&gt;= 0.17), libgmp10, libisl10 (&gt;= 0.10), libmpc3, libmpfr4 (&gt;= 3.1.2), zlib1g (&gt;= 1:1.1.4) Recommends: libc6-dev (&gt;= 2.13-0ubuntu6) /code/pre  <comment204682> That is not simple :) Homebrew and other packaging systems use an exact build of a tool so that they can test things work - versions of tools give different results and so would not work in the same way - especially compilers. <comment204683> Why do you want that gcc and not Homebrew's - or why not use Apple's clang -- answer to this might help us give suggestions to help you <comment204801> Maybe I didn't say it clearly, my gcc is consistent with gmp, mpfr etc... And I woult like to use "this" gcc to compile other package installed by Homebrew, is it possible? <comment204825> Yes, it's posible if you symlink `gcc` with `/usr/local/bin/gcc-4.9`. Additionally you can edit the installation script (python) of each formula by `brew edit formula`. <comment204827> I think I already do the symlink, and "which gcc" indeed point to /usr/local/bin/gcc, but Homebrew still download its own dependent gcc, for example, when I "brew install suite-sparse", it downloads gcc-4.9.1, while I alreadyhave gcc-4.9.2 locally <comment204828> Maybe the `suite-sparse` needs this version of `gcc`, check it with `brew edit suite-sparse`.
