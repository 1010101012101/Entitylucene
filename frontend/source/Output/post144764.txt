I Would Like To Open Files in Different Tabs in the Same Window Using Xcode 5 <body> I'm new to using Xcode.  When I started using Xcode a couple of weeks ago I had a file list to the left and had three tabs open for different files.  I'm not sure if that was a default setting or not.  This morning there was an update to iTunes.  I could not update it without closing Xcode.  Before if I opened a new tab it would open the same file that was in the other tab.  All I had to do was open a new file and it would open in the active tab.  Now when I open files they open in a new window.  I have done online searches but they are for previous versions of Xcode.  How do I set up my preferences where a file list displays to the left as before and open files in new tabs instead of new windows?  <answer144767> Left column in Xcode is called strongNavigator/strong. You can show/hide it with kbd⌘/kbd+kbd0/kbd (Zero), or in the upper right window corner, see image:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tAz52.png" alt="enter image description here"  In the strongNavigator/strong there are dfferent tabs (Project Navigator, Symbols Navigator etc.). To see list of files in Your project You need to select strongProject Navigator/strong or press kbd⌘/kbd+kbd1/kbd.  To open file in current tab, single click on it in Navigator. If You double click the file, it would open in new window/tab. You can change the behaviour of double click in codePreferences.../code - codeNavigation/code - codeDouble Click Navigation/code.  <comment170525> Do You open file by double or single click? Double click opens file in new window/tab (depending on prefs), single click opens it in active tab.
