iPad 3G, is it only 3G <body> Can the iPad 3G only use 3G and Wifi, or can it use Edge or 2G (the little blue dot on iphone)?  <answer1508> The iPad uses the same mobile chip set as the iPhone and cam (depending on your data provider) use Edge (denoted by an E) or GPRS (seen as a circle).  O2 in the UK definitely does.  <answer1525> "strong3G + WiFi/strong" is just a commercial tag line.  the 3G part stands for internet access throughout a mobile connection, usually using a SIM Card.  The strongfull range of connections/strong on a "3G" model strongcan be found in the Technical Specifications/strong of the product, in this case:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PbD0G.png" alt="alt text"  <comment1333> Thanks, so I need to account for this in my app :) <comment18422> I can vouch that it works over EDGE.  My in-laws live in the Texas Panhandle and I only get EDGE reception there.
