Will my iphone work on GSM carriers? <body> I've got an iphone 6 of the A1586 model. The fact that this model is called a Global/Sprint model confuses me. I believe it is unlocked.   Will it be able to use 4G and call from CDMA carriers like Verizon, and will I be able to call and use 4G from a GSM carrier, like T-Mobile?
