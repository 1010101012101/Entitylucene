Why does my Airport Extreme hard drive path change between Data and Data-1? <body> I have an Airport Extreme and my connection to the internal drive has a path to either the codeData/code or codeData-1/code folder.   This changes often when I reconnect and causes problems for programs referring to the path.  strongHow can I troubleshoot this or configure things so the path remains static between connections?/strong
