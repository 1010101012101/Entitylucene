Can't download Xcode Beta 3 without Apple Developer membership <body> Prior to this, one could easily download Xcode Beta from Apple Developer portal with only their Apple ID. There was no need for Apple Developer membership. (I downloaded Xcode 7 Beta 1 without any problems.) But now that Xcode 7 Beta 3 is released, after I click the download button and sign in using my Apple ID, this page.  I'm not aware of any announcements regarding this issue. Is there some kind of bug involved or Apple limited the access to Xcode Beta for registered developers?  <answer210444> Seems like the problem is resolved. I can download Xcode Beta from Apple Developer website.  <comment253365> I've had this problem too. Have you contacted Apple? <comment253370> Did you do as the message says (agree to updated license)? <comment253371> @patrix How can I do that? I headed to the Member Center but didn't see anything about agreeing to updated license. <comment253377> Yeah, just noticed that as well, sorry. Would try again tomorrow or contact Apple.
