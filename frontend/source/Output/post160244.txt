Apple Wireless Keyboard (Bluetooth) not responsive in Windows <body> From time to time, I have to turn off my Apple wireless keyboard to save battery when I'm away from the computer to run an errand, and when I come back to the computer, I would turn the keyboard back on. After turning the Apple Wireless Keyboard off and on a few times (running errands and back to the computer then goes out running errand again and back...), the keyboard becomes unresponsive (registers no input, and when I hit the caps lock button, the keyboard wouldn't turn on the caps lock light).   I tried to fix the problem by looking at Control Panel == Bluetooth Setting, it does show that my keyboard is "Connected" when I turned it back on. However, it's just not responsive at all... I'll have to remove the keyboard from Bluetooth Settings and re-pair it with Windows to make it responsive again. Or I have to restart windows to make it responsive.   What I've tried so far:  1) I've unchecked "Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power" for my bluetooth img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/W0CNc.png" alt="enter image description here"  2) I've tried Dave's advice from this blog  but neither attempt fixed the issue. Is there a setting I need to change to make the keyboard remain responsive after turning it off and on a few times? Thank you!
