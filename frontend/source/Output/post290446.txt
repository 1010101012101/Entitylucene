Is it possible to block specific list websites on all devices? <body> I would like to block a list of websites on iPhone, iPad, and MacBook. On Mac you can use apps like SelfControl but I would rather like to set on one device and sync on others.   But is it possible? On iDevice you can block websites via Restriction settings, but I don't like to set all of them on both iPhone and iPad, let alone MacBook.  Is there any workaround on this problem? For example, is there any private API to set these restricted websites? In that case I may be able to set programmatically all websites to all devices whenever I add a new one...
