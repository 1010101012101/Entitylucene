How do you record audio from command line with osx? <body> I've tried ffmpeg but there is no /dev/dsp device.  <answer25022> Try SoX or Ecasound.  <answer74205> I'd recommend looking into MPlayer OSX Extended -- it's a port of the linux app "mplayer" and will let you record from a multitude of audio sources (including streams and remote files).  precode/Applications/MPlayer\ OSX\ Extended.app/Contents/Resources/Binaries/mpextended.mpBinaries/Contents/mpextended.mpBinaries/Contents/MacOS/mplayer \     http://server.com/stream.pl \     -cache 1024 -ao coreaudio:device_id=49 -volume 65 -ac hwac3, -slave \     -identify -noar -dumpstream -dumpfile ~/Desktop/stream.mp3 /code/pre  See http://www.mplayerosx.ch/ for more information  <comment28182> Those could work but I'd really like to have a ffmpeg solution because I alredy use it for other things. <comment28190> Apparently ffmpeg supports Mac audio recording out of the box if built with [OpenAL](http://www.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html#SEC65). So go right ahead.
