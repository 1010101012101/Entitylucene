iPhone 5c does not alert imessages from email addresses <body> I have an iPhone 5c running iOS 9.3.1  Why does iMessage only give me sound and alerts when a message comes from a phone number and not when it comes from an email address?  <answer234234> On the iPhone go to codeSettings --&gt; Notifications --&gt; Messages/code and make sure the following are all turned on, depending on what you want:  ul licodeAllow Notifications/code/li licodeShow in Notification Center/code/li licodeSounds --&gt; &lt;select sound&gt;/code/li licodeBadge App Icon/code/li licodeShow on Lock Screen/code/li /ul  Under codeAlert Style When Unlocked/code select either codeBanners/code or codeAlerts/code, depending on how you want to be alerted.  As mentioned by @bmike, your codeDo Not Disturb/code setting will affect if the alerts go thru or not.  <comment286350> How is the sender sending the non phone messages? <comment286356> Welcome to Ask Different. could you edit this to correct my assumption on your version if needed? Also - are you aware of the do not disturb setting that can be enabled for a thread as opposed to the entire app/system?
