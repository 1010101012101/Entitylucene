Apple Pages showing only first and last page of documents <body> I've a friend with a problem on his MacBook Air (updated).  Every document he opens with Apple Pages (updated) get displayed only partially. The app shows just the first page and the last one.  I have already tried uninstalling Pages and installing over, but the problem persist. I even tried deleting the app preferences.  The documents work perfectly on Google Docs.  Suggestions?  <comment309137> Is it all documents or just one document? <comment309138> All the documents
