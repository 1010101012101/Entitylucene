Mac OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion Licensing <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   Can I use the new Lion OS X license on two machines, or do I have to buy one for each?       I have a few users that work with me that needed to reload Mountain Lion on their laptops. They had no connectivity so I let them borrow my bootable thumb drive.  Other than trusting their word.. What happens if they didn't actually buy a copy of ML? Does that mean that I violated my agreement?  I read more about the agreement here:   http://osxdaily.com/2012/07/26/install-upgrade-os-x-mountain-lion-multiple-macs/  More specifically this:     em“(i) to download, install, use, and run for personal, non-commercial use, one (1) copy of the Apple Software directly on each Apple-branded computer running OS X Lion or OS X Snow Leopard (“Mac computer”) that you own or control.”/em   <comment79615> Also this should help if the first question wasn't helpful.. http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/68493/how-many-copies-of-mountain-lion-does-one-app-store-download-get-me <comment79700> I don't agree that this is an exact duplicate. My question is: how can I verify that someone has a license if they do not have connectivity? I'm being a good samaritan and providing them a physical copy of the software... Should I never provide other people with a copy then?
