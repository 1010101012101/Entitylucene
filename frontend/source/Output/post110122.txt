Is there any downside to buying the Apple TV 3rd generation rather than the 3rd Generation Rev A? <body> The 3rd generation Apple TV apparently comes in two versions:  ul li3rd generation (A1427, model MD199LL/A)/li li3rd generation emRev A/em (A1469, emalso/em model MD199LL/A)/li /ul  According to the Apple TV article on Wikipedia these models are identical except for some internal architectural changes which make the Rev A model consume less power.  I'm seeing some prices for the original model A1427 about 25% cheaper than the A1469 model.  Is there any reason to not get the cheaper device?  For example do I risk potential lack of future software support for the older model? E.g. is it conceivable that Apple could release a software version that runs on the A1469 but doesn't run on the A1427?   <answer157471> Rev A can perform peer-to-peer Airplay wireless streaming.
