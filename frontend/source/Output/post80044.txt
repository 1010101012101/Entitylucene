Remove recovery feature from recovery disk <body> I mistakenly made a recovery disk from my USB external Hard drive. By making recovery dosk I can no longer use its entire 500 GB space. Now I want to restore this disk to original state so that I could use its entire space. How can I restore external HDD?  <comment92320> When you say "made a recovery disk", do you mean with the [Recovery Disk Assistant](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4848), or something else? Also, was there anything on the external drive that you care about (i.e. do we need to worry about data recovery, or just erase it and start over)? <comment92341> Yes I made it with Recovery Disk Assistant and also there was data on the disk and want to recover it.
