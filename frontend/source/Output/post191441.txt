homebrew libgfortran <body> My Python app is using scipy which apparently needs libgfortran. After a recent brew update/upgrade, my Python app fails to run due to a libgfortran dependency issue:  precodedlopen(&lt;snip&gt;/scipy-0.14.0-py2.7-macosx-10.10-intel.egg/scipy/linalg/_fblas.so, 2): Library not loaded: /usr/local/lib/gcc/4.9/libgfortran.3.dylib /code/pre  I have gcc 4.9 installed, but there is no fortran library or anything matching /usr/local/lib/gcc/4.9/emfort/em. There are tons of other libs in /usr/local/lib/gcc/4.9/  I successfully installed gcc 4.9 through homebrew, however I could not get gfortran installed:  precode➜  ~  brew install gfortran Error: No available formula for gfortran  GNU Fortran is now provided as part of GCC, and can be installed with:   brew install gcc ➜  ~  brew install gcc      Warning: gcc-5.1.0 already installed ➜  ~  brew install homebrew/versions/gcc49 Warning: homebrew/versions/gcc49-4.9.2_1 already installed ➜  ~  brew install homebrew/versions/gcc49 gfortran Error: No available formula for gfortran  GNU Fortran is now provided as part of GCC, and can be installed with:   brew install gcc ➜  ~  brew install gcc gfortran       Error: No available formula for gfortran  GNU Fortran is now provided as part of GCC, and can be installed with:   brew install gcc /code/pre  <answer191794> It should be installed and linked from the gcc formula:  precode~ » readlink `which gfortran`                                                                                       ../Cellar/gcc/5.1.0/bin/gfortran /code/pre
