Where do I put a custom ringtone for Facetime? (macos Sierra) <body> I like that Facetime Continuity allows my phone to ring on my computer. But it repeats the sound aggressively and it loops way too fast..   I created a quieter tone with eight seconds before it loops. But I can't figure out where to put it.   Apparently in Yosemite you could unlock access to this folder and put it here:   ul li/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/ToneLibrary.framework/Versions/A/Resources/Ringtones//li /ul  But I don't see any info on where to put it in Sierra. Any thoughts?  <answer294968> h1Overview/h1  Here are the steps that worked for me:  ol liDisable System Integrity Protection (see below for details)./li liPut your custom ringtone file in /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/ToneemLibrary/em.framework/Versions/A/Resources/Ringtones//li liEdit the system's property list of ringtones at /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/ToneemKit/em.framework/Versions/A/Resources/TKRingtones.plist (see below for details)./li liChoose your custom ringtone in FaceTime preferences./li liRe-enable System Integrity Protection (see below for details)./li /ol  h1Enabling/Disabling System Integrity Protection/h1  It looks like in macOS Sierra (actually starting from El Capitan), Apple has implemented a System Integrity Protection technology that restricts access to /System. In order to play around with custom ringtones, you would need to disable System Integrity Protection     To enable or disable System Integrity Protection [...]      ol   liBoot to Recovery OS by restarting your machine and holding down the   Command and R keys at startup./li   liLaunch Terminal from the Utilities   menu./li   liEnter the following command: code$ csrutil enable/code [or use the command code$ csrutil disable/code to disable System Integrity Protection]/li   /ol      After enabling or disabling System Integrity Protection on a machine,   a reboot is required.   emSources/em: Apple Support, Apple Developer  h1Editing TKRingtones.plist/h1  In order to make your custom ringtone show up in the list of ringtones in FaceTime preferences, you will need to edit the file /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/ToneemKit/em.framework/Versions/A/Resources/TKRingtones.plist using TextEdit (or some other text editor -- you can also use Xcode's developer tools for a nicer interface). Specifically, add code&lt;string&gt;system:Custom Ringtone Name&lt;/string&gt;/code at the location shown below (you should replace "Custom Ringtone Name" with the name of your ringtone file).  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict&gt;     // lots of stuff omitted here     &lt;key&gt;modern&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;array&gt;         &lt;string&gt;&amp;lt;default&amp;gt;&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;string&gt;system:Custom Ringtone Name&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;string&gt;system:Apex&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;string&gt;system:Beacon&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;string&gt;system:Bulletin&lt;/string&gt;         // lots of stuff omitted here     &lt;/array&gt;     &lt;key&gt;sort&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;true/&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  <comment372342> I've placed the file in the ringtone folder and that doesn't work. For Facetime, I think there's another location for the ringtones and alerts, but I don't know where. Any ideas? <comment372409> Good point. I think the ringtone folder is correct, but the important thing is that you need to also add your custom ringtone as an entry to the list (TKRingtones.plist) of ringtones that FaceTime offers as options. I've edited my answer to reflect this.
