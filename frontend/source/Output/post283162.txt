Approve this mac using another device <body> I bought a new MacBook Pro (macOS Sierra v10.12.4), and I'm having some issues with iCloud. Even tho I never had a Mac before, I did run on my VMWare a MacOS (I don't recall using the iCloud back then).  Whenever I try to log in to the iCloud, it asks for my Apple ID and MacBook Pro passwords. after that, I get this message: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PKFyU.png" alt="iCloud security code form"  When I click the strongForgot Code?/strong button, I get an alert that says:     If you can't remember the iCloud Security code, you can approve this Mac using another device.   strongCancel/strong | strongUse Other Device/strong   When I click on the strongUse Other Device/strong button, the alert gets closed and then nothing happens. I've tried running iCloud on my PC to get by any chance there the code, but unfortunately, no luck.  Any solutions?  <answer283171> Do you have an iPhone or iPad? If yes, then one of these can be used to receive the code. A PC won't work as I know.  If you still don't receive the code on your iDevices, try the following on your iPhone or iPad:  ol liGo to strongSettings/strong  strongemYour Name/em/strong (Apple ID, iCloud, iTunes &amp; App Store)  strongPassword &amp; Security/strong./li liEnter your Apple ID password when asked./li liTap strongGet Verification Code/strong/li /ol  This might only work with Keychain enabled on your iDevice.  If you don't have any other Apple devices, it could be your last option to reset the iCloud Keychain. But in this case I'd prefer to call the official Apple Support.  <comment356968> Looks like you have 2-Factor Authentication turned on.  Can you log into icloud.com and turn it off? <comment356969> @fsb I can login to icloud.com. Although, I don't see 2-Factor Authentication in there. <comment356971> Looks like you need to change it from a different site.  See if this info helps: http://osxdaily.com/2016/08/17/disable-two-factor-authentication-apple-id/ <comment357013> Ok. TBH not the answer I hoped for, but looks like I should call them after all. Thanks.
