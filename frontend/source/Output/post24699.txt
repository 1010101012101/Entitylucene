Can I edit content on an FTP server through Finder? <body> Is there any way around the read-only access that Finder strictly allows so I can get write access to a FTP server through Finder?  <answer24701> Try Transmit.     With the new Transmit Disk feature, you can now mount any of your favorites in the Finder itself, even if Transmit's not running. These volumes are real: drag files to your SFTP server, save a small graphic to your Amazon S3 bucket directly from Photoshop, or roll your own iDisk-like backup volume. It's all possible in T4.   <answer24703> No you can't get around the read-only access, but here are some great FTP clients:  h1Cyberduck/h1  A great free FTP client. This is my go-to application. Anytime I need FTP access, I use Cyberduck. It's not quite as lightweight as Fugu, but it adds a lot more functionality than Fugu. I like the Growl integration with Cyberduck.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KymVY.png" alt="Cyberduck, a free FTP client"  h1Fugu/h1  Awesome little free FTP client. As I noted above, this is a lightweight FTP client. It is great for simple FTP transfers and browsing. I do like the dual panel navigation.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/y0hrZ.png" alt="Fugu, another free FTP client"  Last, but not least, you can use the CLI. Just type codeftp username@foo.com/code at the prompt. If you've used the command line before, you know that codels/code lists directories, codecd/code changes directories. Example: codels ~/Desktop/code lists the contents of your Desktop (the "~" is a shortcut for your home folder). codecd ~/Desktop/code changes to current directory to your Desktop. To download files, you can use codemget/code or codeget/code. Here's the Apple man page on FTP.  <answer24704> No, but you can use any one of many third-party FTP clients, some of which are free.  FileZilla. Open-source and cross-platform  <answer24752> You can use MacFusion, which allows to connect to a FTP server through a filesystem device. MacFusion requires MacFUSE, or OSXFUSE with the compatibility layer for MacFUSE.     ul   liMount files and documents as a "Volume" in the Mac OS X Finder./li   liWork with your files using your favorite Mac OS X applications directly.

I find it much more reliable than installing file system extensions like MacFusion and the various FUSE software. <comment71869> I'm really interested in the mounting function, but when I use it through parallels, my file's content is lost sometimes. It's weird! <comment120064> This link works for OSX Mountain Lion http://downloads.patjack.co.uk/dl/Macfusion.zip <comment135889> WingFS is a version app that does exactly the same thing. http://www.wingfs.com/ <comment218392> Fugu is a PowerPC app, the "intel" version is still in beta <comment265067> The question was about the Finder.
