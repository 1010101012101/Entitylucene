iOS continuous photo App <body> I'm searching for an app (for my iPhone 5S) that takes photos (without stopping) every X seconds. The requirement is an app that takes photos, not videos or directly generates a time lapse animation.  For example: I set "shoot every 1.00 second" and here it is: the phone starts taking pictures every second (through that app of course).  Does anyone know some app for that no matter if it's free or paid?  <answer247731> Suggested cool apps:  ul liHyperlapse (you can set the fastness, which is not possible with iPhone time-lapse)/li liOsnap, which does cost 3.99 but it's worth it!/li /ul
