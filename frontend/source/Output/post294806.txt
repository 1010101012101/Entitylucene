2017 rMBP 13" (TouchBar) - Flickering Screen <body> Following on from a number of posts here and on Apple Support, I am slowly moving closer to finding a solution to graphics glitches on my brand-new MBP. Apple support was unhelpful and most other posts confuse the issue I am having (and a number of other people) with the issues widely reported in 2016.   strongThe Issue/strong  At random intervals, when the MBP is connected to an external 4K Monitor (Dell P2415Q) and wakes up from sleep, the eminternal/em monitor starts flashing while the emexternal/em monitor remains stable. Unplugging the external monitor momentarily reduces the frequency of flashes but does not solve the problem. After a restart, the monitor (or both monitors) function normal. Please note that this does emnot/em happen emevery/em time the mac sleeps.   It seems that the issue first occurred after the 10.12.6 update (but this I am not entirely sure about). The usual remedies (of other apple glitches of the past MBPs) such as SMC resets, NVRAM resets, etc do not fix the issue. However, due to the very specific scenarios in which this happens as well as a number of posts from others with similar issues, I am not convinced that it is a hardware issue.   In addition, after spending quite some time with various logs, the following two Faults seem to be occurring mainly when the issue "strikes":  precodebool IOAccelDisplayPipe2::init_framebuffer_resource(IOAccelResource2 *): getPixelInformation for framebuffer 0 failed  IOReturn IOAccelSurface2::surface_unlock_options(enum eLockType, uint32_t): surface is not locked.  /code/pre  I am not the only one having this issue, here are a couple of videos of other users experiencing the same:   https://youtu.be/YwZ8FRZ-8GI  https://youtu.be/qyuVAxpNdiQ  strongMy Question(s)/strong  ul liHave any of you experienced similar issues with 10.12.6?
