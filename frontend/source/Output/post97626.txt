Bootcamp problem -> not booting into Windows <body> Every three restarts when I'm holding down the option key and try to boot into Win7 the screen goes black and nothing happens. The indicator is the blinking cursor - if it's absent in the start, Windows won't boot. The solution is to either boot into MacOS and then back into Windows or to reset PRAM (cmd+option+P+R). Then it boots. Is there any solution to this?  Although this is a problem for me it's a bigger problem because I wanted to buy a new MacBook Air for my girlfriend and install Windows 8 as a main system - will this work stable for her?
