Boot Camp Crashes - bsod <body> I use boot camp on my 2009 MacBook.   I boot into windows. I have refi installed.   I stay in Windows 90-100 percent of the time.   Every 2-3 days I get a bsod. Typically during the middle of the day. Always when I am not using the computer.   I have latest version of windows and boot camp.   Any suggestions?  <comment44748> To be honest, bootcamp just allows you to boot into Windows, once you're there it has no influence on stopping doing Windows from what it does best.  Might be better on another forum, armed with whatever random "0X02139092 IRQ is less then or equal to zero" message it spat at you :) <comment44756> As stuffe said, this might be off-topic for this site, but regardless: please try to capture whatever specific error the BSOD mentions. Without more info, one can only speculate as to what the problem could be. <comment53058> UPDATE: I reimaged the computer (both sides) and now I no longer get BSOD crashes. Not sure what was causing the problem. I have removed REFI and perhaps that was the culprit.
