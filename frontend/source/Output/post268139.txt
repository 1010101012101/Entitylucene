How to turn off your MacBook Pro 2016 with Touch Bar via keyboard shortcut <body> Since my new MacBook Pro 2016 with Touch Bar I'm unable to turn off my MacBook using the keyboard kbdCNTR/kbdkbdOPTION/kbdkbdCMD/kbd + kbdPower/kbd. I saw this question about the screen lock: Simular question but there is no button in the Touch bar for turning off the Mac completely. Is there a new keyboard shortcut for this?  These are the only options to drag into the Touch Bar: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/I5FMd.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer268142> The keyboard shortcut you refer to was actually only one of two keyboard shortcuts that worked the same way. The other one was to use kbdControl/kbdkbdOption/kbdkbdCommand/kbd and the kbdEject/kbd key instead of the kbdPower/kbd button.  Regardless, both of these keyboard shortcut combinations will quit all apps and shut down your Mac. Of course, if you have any open documents that have not been saved you'll be asked whether you want to save them.  Since you have a Touch Bar model, I suspect you will just need to ensure you're in the right interface to see the kbdEject/kbd key option.  Otherwise, what actually happens if you still use the kbdControl/kbdkbdOption/kbdkbdCommand/kbd and the kbdPower/kbd combination, remembering that in your case the Touch ID doubles up as your kbdPower/kbd button?  If there is no way to get that to work, you could add your own custom keyboard shortcut to achieve what you want, but that will mean changing some of the other Function Key behaviours - if this is an acceptable option and you need assistance to do this, let me know and I'll update this answer.  strong[UPDATE]/strong  As requested via comments, here are the steps to creating a custom keyboard shortcut using one of your Function keys to replicate the kbdControl/kbdkbdOption/kbdkbdCommand/kbdkbdPower/kbd button combination:  ol liGo to strongSystem Preferences/strong/li liSelect the strongKeyboard/strong option/li liEnsure you are on the emKeyboard/em tab/li liMake sure that the emUse all F1,F2, etc. keys as standard function keys/em is strongnot/strong ticked/li liNow choose the strongShortcuts/strong tab/li liSelect strongApp Shortcuts/strong in the lefthand column/li liClick "strong+/strong" symbol at the bottom of the right pane/li liLeave the Application drop-down as emAll Applications/em/li liIn the Menu Title field type this in exactly: strongShut Down.../strong/li liIn the Keyboard shortcut field press the kbdfn/kbd and kbdF1/kbd keys/li liClick on strongAdd/strong/li liExit System Preferences/li /ol  Now you should be able to just press the kbdfn/kbdkbdF1/kbd key combination to shutdown your MBP.  strongNOTE:/strong The reason at Step 4 I wanted you to ensure that the emUse all F1,F2, etc. keys as standard function keys/em is strongnot/strong ticked was because you wanted to set the keyboard shortcut on a key that is already used for something else. However, if you do want to leave emUse all F1,F2, etc. keys as standard function keys/em ticked, you can change the original kbdF1/kbd key shortcut to something else first and then set the kbdF1/kbd key (without the need for the kbdfn/kbd key) as your keyboard shortcut.  Any questions, just ask.  <comment336545> Doesn't the Touch ID sensor button function as the power key? <comment336775> Nop that was my first try. <comment336777> The Eject button is no part of the Touch Bar button options (see my post with a screenshot with possible options) <comment336784> Just added a couple of paragraphs to my answer - does this help at all? <comment336792> The touchID / power button doesn't work with this shortkey, please let me know how to make my own shortkey for this. The eject button is maybe visible when I install the portable DVD drive. But this is no option <comment336804> Okay, in that case are there any Function Keys you currently use that you don't want changed? Or, more to the point, what Function Key would you be happy to change to become your new _Quit all apps and shutdown_ key? Or are you happy for me to just pick one of the lesser used ones for you? <comment336815> F1 would be great <comment336821> Just added the instructions you requested. Let me know how you go.
