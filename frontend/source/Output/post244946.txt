Configuring application servers to run as service daemons? <body> Mac 10.9.5 here. I am trying to figure out how to configured my machine to run an executable (Java) app as a service/daemon, so that it is emalways/em running so long as the machine is on. Hence, this app needs to start when I boot up, when I come back after being away for a while ('waking up'), etc.  Say I can manually run my app (server) by running:  precodejava -jar /Users/myuser/utils/myapp.jar /code/pre  strongHow can I get codemyapp.jar/code to run as a service/daemon?/strong  <comment301901> Look at Apple's documentation e.g. https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn2083/_index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS10003794-CH1-SUBSECTION47  This is a comment as the question is a duplicate and I don't have time to search for it <comment301910> Thanks @Mark (+1) if this question is a dupe would you mind providing a link to the question it is a dupe of? If that other question does in fact address my OS version as well then I will happily delete this question myself!
