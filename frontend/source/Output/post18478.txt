Temporary files listed by lsof don't exist <body> I like copying flash videos for offline viewing later. I used to do this by loading the video in the browser (Firefox or Google Chrome), then running this command to see where the flash file was being cached:  precodelsof | grep ^Google | grep folders /code/pre  This will show all the temporary files Google Chrome has open at the moment, for example:  precode...

Why can't I access the temporary files?  Since my goal is to copy the flash file for later viewing, is there anything else I can do?  <answer18481> Have you tried putting the path in quotes?   Like this:   precode$ ls "/private/var/folders/zz/zzTLi2haPMrCYxEbpkwFmS+++TI/-Tmp-/.com.google.chrome.p22bCa"  /code/pre  <answer18494> On some unix variants, codelsof/code shows files that have been deleted but are still open. More precisely, these files have a “link count” of 0, meaning that there is no directory entry (no link, i.e. no name) that leads to them, but the file data still exists. The file data will be deleted when the file is closed.  The ability of codelsof/code to display files with a link count of 0 depends on the platform, and I can't find anything in the documentation regarding the situation on OS X. Try running codelsof +L/code to see the files' link count, or codelsof +L1/code to list only files with a link count of 0.  I wouldn't be surprised if the flash plugin created the file and immediately deleted in, it's a simple technique for making the data harder to obtain from outside the application. In other words, it's what the plugin author would do precisely to make it hard to do what you're trying to do. If that's what going on, you could counter it with something like libtrash for OSX.  <answer52123> Try this:  precodecp /proc/$pid$/fd/$fdid$ /code/pre  Where:  ul licode$pid$/code - Process id/li licode$fdid$/code - File descriptor id/li /ul  Process ids usually are code4/code codedigit/code numbers. File descriptors usually have a letter next to them (coder/code, codeu/code, codew/code, etc.).  Take this one for example:  precodeGoogle    311 mike   22u     REG       14,1      9974 17819369 /private/var/folders/z... /code/pre  Replace code$pid$/code with 311 and code$fdid$/code with 22 so that you get:  precodecp /proc/311/fd/22 /code/pre  <answer76305> h1lsof without sudo may not list all open files/h1  Rule of thumb:   ul lito ensure comprehensive results from codelsof/code, use codesudo/code/li /ul  h2Example/h2  Run the two commands below. Observe the differences in output. With privileges, expect to find many more lines.   h3Without superuser privileges/h3  precodelsof / | grep root /code/pre  h3With privileges/h3  precodesudo lsof / | grep root /code/pre  <comment20213> The quotes don't help. I'll add to the question that listing the directory doesn't show any `.com.google.chome.*` files or directories. <comment20214> I know this isn't answering your question but have you tried something like flv download? https://bitbucket.org/m.23/flv_download/wiki/Home <comment20227> This appears to be why the files are not visible with `ls`. Indeed, running `lsof +L` shows link counts of 0. Thanks for explaining this! <comment59646> Immediately deleting temporary files is also a good way to make sure the files will be removed if the application crashes (or if there is a power failure). <comment59703> Mac OS X doesn't have the `/proc` filesystem. <comment139097> In Super User, for OS X: [lsof reports no files open on external volume but it still cannot be safely unmounted](http://superuser.com/q/651264/84988)
