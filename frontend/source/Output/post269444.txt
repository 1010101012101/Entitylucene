Enabling parental controls breaks the timely transfer of HTTP response with chunked transfer encoding <body> It seems that enabling parental controls—even with no restriction on what can be viewed on the web—has adverse effects. Specifically, it seems to fire up some kind of local HTTP proxy that filters outgoing requests and incoming responses.  Sometimes, HTTP servers will serve responses as chunks—write a little bit of the response body, wait for a while, write some more, etc., and maybe eventually close the response, or keep it open indefinitely. This is known as chunked transfer encoding. In order for this to work, the client must be able to read part of the response without waiting for the server to actually close it (as it may keep it open indefinitely).  This principle is used as a basis for Comet server push and Server-Sent Events (a.k.a. EventSource).  Now, it appears that the local HTTP proxy fired up by Parental Controls doesn't correctly forward those responses chunk by chunk. It waits until the whole response (or a certain amount of data) has been received before passing it on.  So:  ul liHave others seen/reported this problem?/li liHow can I work around it, without asking all my users to disable Parent Controls?/li /ul
