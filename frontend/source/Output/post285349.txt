MBP won't restart or shutdown (macOS Sierra) <body> I'm desperately trying to fix the issue which doesn't let my MacBook Pro restart/shutdown properly. When I click on restart or shutdown, it gets stuck when the display gets black (but still slightly on, also keyboard lights are on) forever (once let it try to restart/shutdown the whole night).   When I bought the mbp, it was El Capitan installed. I've upgraded to Sierra (now code10.12.3/code) and then problems started, but I'm really not if it happened right after the upgrade or sometime later.  After booting into safe mode, restart/shutdown works.  Things I've tried so far:  ul liclose/force quit all apps before restart/shut down/li lirelaunch finder before restart/shut down/li liremoved all apps from login items/li litried another user profile/li liran "First Aid" on Disk Utility/li lirestart/shut down works after booting into safe mode/li lireseted SMC/li lireseted NVRAM/li liran Apple Diagnostics (no issues)/li liran cache clearing commands:/li /ul  coderm -rf ~/Library/Caches/*;  rm -rf ~/Library/Saved\ Application\ State/*; sudo rm -rf /Library/Caches/*; sudo rm -rf /System/Library/Caches/*; atsutil databases -removeUser; sudo atsutil databases -remove; sudo atsutil server -shutdown; sudo atsutil server -ping; sudo rm -rf /var/folders/*/code  ul lideleted all printers/li litried shutdown -r now/li liremoved com.apple.finder.plist &amp; com.apple.sidebarlists.plist/li liran a system update so permissions are going to be repaired/li /ul  <answer285355> Fixing permissions on my drive solved the issue.  I was able to find a solution on this Apple Discussion thread.
