Can not select Airplay Device in OSX <body> When I click on my Airplay speaker in Sound settings, it jumps back.  I have to restart my Mac in order to fix this problem.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HkbGa.png" alt="enter image description here" How can I fix this issue without restarting my Mac?  <answer85624> There is command line solution that I've found in Mac Rumors      precodesudo kill `ps -ax | grep 'coreaudiod' | grep 'sbin' |awk '{print $1}'` /code/pre  Which can assigned to an alias:  precodealias fixairplay="sudo kill `ps -ax | grep 'coreaudiod' | grep 'sbin' |awk '{print $1}'`" /code/pre  Then this command fixes the issue:  precodefixairplay /code/pre  <answer112158> What you need to do is to restart the coreaudio deamon (codecoreaudiod/code). Open up the terminal and run codesudo killall coreaudiod/code. As simple as that.  Then if you're having a difficult time memorizing the above, you can add the following line to code~/.bash_profile/code  precodealias fixairplay='sudo killall coreaudiod' /code/pre  From now on you can just use the alias codefixairplay/code.  <answer229795> Inspired from Mohsen, but simplified by using strongpgrep/strong.    codesudo kill `pgrep coreaudio`/code  strongpgrep/strong's reason for existence is to avoid parsing strongps/strong output and is much safer to use when being sent to strongkill/strong, IMHO cause you are less likely to grab the wrong process info.  Anyway, the accepted answer worked great (Mavericks).  pgrep @ wikipedia (man is waaay too obscure)  <answer244444> I've had the same behavior with HDMI, as well. I.e. For some reason which I have yet to identify, my mac mini (running Mavericks) will switch to using the internal speakers, and any attempt to switch back to HDMI doesn't just bounces back to internal speakers.  Killing coreaudio (which will then restart itself) fixes the HDMI issue as well.  @0sh and @jl-peyret have the simplest commands, which can be entered in the terminal:  precodesudo kill `pgrep coreaudio` /code/pre  or  precodesudo killall coreaudiod /code/pre  For people who like to shy away from the terminal, you can also quit the strongcoreaudiod/strong process from the strongActivity Monitor/strong.  There are some other recommendations, if this doesn't fix things, in this article, though some of them are a bit extreme.  <comment169121> Works like a charm. You sir, made my day!
