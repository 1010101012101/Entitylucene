How do I disable the Command-Control-D word definition keyboard shortcut in OS X Lion? <body> Mac OS X Lion introduced a new feature where in many applications you can press  (Command-Control-D) to produce a popup with the definition for the word under the mouse cursor. A side effect of this is that you can no longer use the same shortcut to access functionality in other applications (for example, Emacs).  Is it possible to either  a) disable the word definition Command-Control-D keyboard shortcut, or br b) change the word definition keyboard shortcut to something other than Command-Control-D?  <answer23911> Yes, through System Preferences, you can change and disable keyboard shortcuts.  Go to System Prefs - Keyboard - and hit the tab Keyboard Shortcuts.  Click the Services entry, and scroll down to the Searching set of shortcuts.  Uncheck the lookup in dictionary to disable it, or double click the space to the right to change the shortcut.    <answer29398> In Lion specifically, strongSystem Preferences / Keyboard / Keyboard Shortcuts / Searching / Look Up in Dictionary/strong will allow you to assign an additional shortcut keystroke to do a Dictionary lookup, but it won't disable Command-Control-D for other applications to use.  In Snow Leopard, the same Command-Control-D lookup is available, but it can be reassigned by the user.  I hope this is just seen as a bug to correct in an update rather than a new 'feature'.  I'd grown accustomed to mapping that combination to other things in SL.  <answer114269> To disable the Control-Command-D binding enter the following in the terminal:  precodedefaults write com.apple.symbolichotkeys AppleSymbolicHotKeys -dict-add 70 '&lt;dict&gt;&lt;key&gt;enabled&lt;/key&gt;&lt;false/&gt;&lt;/dict&gt;' /code/pre  and restart.  <comment27275> There is no keyboard shortcut entry for this particular key combination in System Preferences. <comment94662> Gaah!  This is just now starting to bite me.   Also: Hi, Zane! <comment141093> This is the most reliable way to disable the command, was difficult to find this! <comment196580> Restarting is a key part. I've seen the `defaults` invocation mentioned in a few places on the web, but none of them mentioned restarting, which is required for the new setting to take effect. (At least on OS X 10.10.1.) <comment278859> Without disabling this key, `C-M-d' did not work on Emacs GUI when using Command as Meta (see [here](http://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/20526/c-m-d-not-working-on-emacs-gui-osx-using-mac-command-key-as-meta/20544#20544)). I've sent a [PR](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/pull/630) to mathiasbynens's .osx dotfiles so that it gets disabled there and many Emacs users can benefit. Vote it up! :) <comment348219> Looks like PR was closed, but at least issue is well documented. <comment371225> in macOs Sierra 10.12.5 , its under *ï£¿ -- System Preferences -- Keyboard  Shortcuts (tab)   Services ( on left pan)  Searching ( on right pan)* and then Uncheck "Lookup in Directory" checkbox
