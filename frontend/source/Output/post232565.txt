Get URL of opened tab / tabs from terminal <body> I have a tab open in Google Chrome. Is it possible to get or check it's url from terminal? If not, how about automator script?  Will also be satisfied with a title.  <answer232592> To get the URL or Title of a Tab within Google Chrome via the command line, in a Terminal you can use codeosascript/code to either execute AppleScript emstatements/em or a emprogramfile/em.  To see what is available in the Google Chrome AppleScript Dictionary, the dictionary can be opened and reviewed in the Script Editor using the File  Open Dictionary... command.  Here's a simple example to get the URL of the first Tab of the frontmost Google Chrome window:  precodeosascript -e 'tell application "Google Chrome" to get URL of tab 1 of window 1' /code/pre  For the Title under the same conditions:  precodeosascript -e 'tell application "Google Chrome" to get title of tab 1 of window 1' /code/pre  To get them both at the same time, under the same conditions:  precodeosascript -e 'tell application "Google Chrome" to get {title, URL} of tab 1 of window 1' /code/pre  Depending on exactly what it is you're trying to accomplish the emstatements/em can be more complex and handle multiple Tabs and or Windows, etc.  Although this is where using codeosascript/code to call a emprogramfile/em verses using code-e statement/code will probably be easier.  hr  Here's the output from Terminal when this page is the target Tab:  precode$ osascript -e 'tell application "Google Chrome" to get URL of tab 1 of window 1' http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/232565/get-url-of-opened-tab-tabs-from-terminal $ osascript -e 'tell application "Google Chrome" to get title of tab 1 of window 1' osx - Get URL of opened tab / tabs from terminal - Ask Different $ osascript -e 'tell application "Google Chrome" to get {title, URL} of tab 1 of window 1' osx - Get URL of opened tab / tabs from terminal - Ask Different, http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/232565/get-url-of-opened-tab-tabs-from-terminal $  /code/pre
