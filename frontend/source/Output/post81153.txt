Sleep and Hibernate Disabled (Greyed Out) in Boot Camp 4.0 on 2012 MBA <body> Just installed Windows 7 and Boot Camp 4.0 on a brand new 2012 MacBook Air and I'm having display issues where the screen will go dark (but still backlit) and won't turn back on. You can hear the chime when you hit keys so you know the OS in running. Also Sleep and Hibernate are disabled. Anyone else find a fix to this? It seems a lot of people are having similar problems with Boot Camp.
