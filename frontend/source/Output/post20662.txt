Find information about host IP address? <body> Is there anyway to ping a computer's IP and find out some basic information about it? Platform, OS, etc...  If so, how would that be done?  <answer20666> Using codenmap/code from MacPorts you can run the following command to attempt to identify the OS of a remote machine:  codesudo nmap ipaddress -O/code  e.g.:  precode$ sudo nmap localhost -O  Starting Nmap 5.51 ( http://nmap.org ) at 2011-08-07 17:58 CEST Nmap scan report for localhost (127.0.0.1) Host is up (0.000085s latency).

Additionally it scans the network and lists all devices. It doesn't have any success recognizing Linux based machines.  <comment22736> And is there a way to include my root password in there so I don't need to enter it on the next line?   `sudo --password="applemac" nmap localhost -O` kinda thing? <comment22743> That'd be wonderful, if I wasn't trying to make the same thing. :) I'm using these commands to write a GUI in python to show active devices, and if you want, get info. Unfortunately, getting people to install nmap and enter their root password is too much, this'll be just for me. <comment22759> If you run this kind of command regularly, you can create a `setuid` binary that would run as root without asking for the root password. I'm not sure why you would want to do this, however. <comment22760> You can ship `nmap` with your GUI, and you can also ship it with a tool with `setuid`. It would then only have to prompt for the admin password *once*. <comment22884> A more secure way would be to edit /etc/sudoers and add an entry in the form `username ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL`. Setting the `setuid` bit allows any user on the system to have sudo access.
