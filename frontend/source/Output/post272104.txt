Apple BROKE importing "iTunes Library.xml", now ONLY imports playlists - not everything <body> As the title says the old "import 'iTunes Library.xml' and migrate everything" trick is no longer working as of iTunes 12.5.5.9 at least.  Does anyone know a workaround or alternate technique for achieving the old behavior? I was in the middle of merging almost a DOZEN older iTunes libraries when I noticed the trick had stopped working!  <comment342002> What trick exactly and what does it do now <comment342003> @Mark - Formerly if you went to "File  Library  Import Playlist" and imported the file created by telling a different iTunes library (say from an old computer) to "File  Library  Export Library", the new library would import EVERYTHING (playlists, songs, ratings, play counts, all of it) and now the same command sequence ONLY imports the Playlists AND NOTHING ELSE! <comment342005> Sounds like something you ought to be reporting to https://bugreport.apple.com
