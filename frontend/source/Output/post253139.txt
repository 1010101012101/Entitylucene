Turn off "From "'website': Are you sure you want to close this window" confirmation dialog in Safari <body> I'm using iPython notebook. Anytime I make a change and close the window without saving I get this  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OKOhe.png" alt="enter image description here"  Is there any way to turn this off, only for Ipython? Its pretty annoying to have to click through when all you've done is add a space.  <comment315028> That pop-up is generated by IPython, not Safari, so there's no way to disabled it in the browser itself. You might be able to craft a Safari extension that overrides it, since it's presumably using JavaScript to generate it. <comment315056> Please state version of iPython. <comment315166> IPython version 3.5.2
