How to make inactive when I close application window by Command + W <body> When I open an Excel file from Finder and close the Excel window by kbdCommand/kbd+kbdW/kbd. The active window remain Excel.  Is there a way to make Finder active window when I close Excel?  If I close the Excel window by kbdCommand/kbd+kbdQ/kbd, the Finder become active but I prefer to keep Excel in memory.  <answer183346> I'm not sure you can really have both…  Telling Excel to close a window doesn't tell Excel to quit. It doesn't actually tell it anything other than you closed a window. It sits there waiting for you to tell it what to do next; it can't guess what your next action is going to be.  Of course, if you Quit it, then it goes away &amp; the last-used app will be frontmost.  Clicking the desktop is the quickest way to bring the Finder to the front.  <answer184557> What is the point of having Excel running without a document open? So that it opens the next document faster? If so, then make sure you have lots of memory (RAM) and then quit using CMD-Q instead of closing the window using CMD-W.   When you have lots of RAM, modern operating systems cache or preserve most or all of the application in memory for when you need it next. This make starting the application next time super quick.  You can see this when you startup your computer. Any large application you start takes a while to come up. If you close it and then re-open it, it is very quick. This is because most of it was still in memory, kept close at hand, so to speak.  But, should you load an application that needs emlots/em of memory, the system may remove Excel from its cache and the next time Excel needs to startup it will be slower…  <answer184564> You can do this with Keyboard Maestro.br Create a macro group just for Excel, then create a macro that executes upon ⌘W which closes the window and switches focus to Finder.                   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0gNVo.png" width="455"  <answer184571> h2Update 1/h2  Based on the comments made by ironsand to grgarside's answer. Step 6 should be changed to:  precodetell application "System Events" to set activeApp to name of application processes whose frontmost is true if length of activeApp is not 0 then     tell application (first item of activeApp) to activate end if /code/pre  hr  h2My Answer to Posted Question/h2  This can be done by creating a Service using the Automator application. However, you will not be able to use the the COMMAND+W key. I would suggest using the CONTROL+W key since Excel has not yet assigned this key to any function.  ol liOpen the Automator Application and click on New Document./li liSelect Service and click Choose./li liSelect File-Save from Menus and save service as "Close and Activate Finder".

Most of the time this will be much more efficient than a switch to the codeFinder/code because we tend to go back to what was just interrupted before.  <comment218746> Thanks for your answer. If there is no way to accomplish what I want by default osx function. It's ok to install some application for it. <comment218748> It would have to be a mind-reader, to know what you wanted. If every time you closed a window, it jumped back to the Finder it would drive you mad in a day. <comment218802> What I want is, every time I close window make the application inactive. I don't think it requires mind-reader. <comment218816> For me - what OP is asking doesn't make sense. But: "Clicking the desktop is the quickest way to bring the Finder to the front." - He can also `⌘`+`W` - `⌘`+`⇥TAB` to quickly switch to last active app. <comment218818> @MateuszSzlosek i agree with his answer <comment218824> Thanks for answer. I installed the software. But I want to activate the last active window, not just Finder. Is there a way to configure like that? <comment218825> I found it! There is `Activate Last Application`. Thanks for your help! <comment218831> @ironsand It would possibly have been helpful if you had stated in your original question that you wanted the *last active window* and not Finder, as it says now. <comment218861> But this script will work even when there are more than one Excel window opened. <comment218864> @MateuszSzlosek This was not specified in the question. Should this be necessary, a simple if check for the frontmost application's window title would suffice. <comment218972> → Mateusz: your comment looks like the simplest and most efficient answer. [@Mateusz Szlosek]. <comment218973> Is this question targeted to `Excel` application only or a more general one? <comment219014> I was asked about general one. <comment219166> → Ironsand: If what you want is to switch to the last active window, then the most efficient and simplest receipe is in my answer :) [@ironsand]. <comment219167> Then I advise you to specify correctly what you really need within your original question. This is where the information will stay. The comments are not here to stay.
