DMG or Package Installer <body> If I need to download an App, what method of installer should I prefer DMG or Package Installer? Which has greater advantage.  <answer136871> DMG is easy drag and drop install for softwares that don't require specific installations;  Package Installer is for softwares who need to have specific parts installed in a specific place (libraries, plug-ins...)  I would prefer the first one, because you can make easy and clean (un)installation with 1 mouse's click.  <comment162477> Is the application for use on your personal Mac or for deployment on multiple Macs? The advantages will depend on how you intend to deploy and maintain the application.
