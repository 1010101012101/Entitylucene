Sort selected columns by row <body> In Numbers, how is it possible to sort selected columns by a row? In the following example I want to sort the columns codeB/code, codeC/code and codeD/code by using the values in row code1/code.  img src="https://i.imgur.com/Cp5ueyM.png" alt="example"  So far, I have only found the reverse action (which does what it is supposed to) "sort selected rows by column".  <answer163158> Transpose the sheet (Table-Transpose rows and columns), sort, and then transpose back. However you may lose some of the formatting, like column widths and row heights.  <comment191056> That is a clever workaround!
