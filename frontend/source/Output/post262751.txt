System hangs when using "Boot in MacOS X" in Bootcamp assistant <body> I was running Windows 10 through Boot Camp without any issues.  After an upgrade to Sierra, whenever I click on the Bootcamp assistant icon and select "Boot into OS X" a restart attempt is made and then after the restart nothing happens. Completely blank screen.  Booting from Sierra to Windows 10 works fine using the "Startup disk" found in System Preferences. I can also boot into Windows 10 using the option-key while powering on the mac.   Any ideas how I should investigate this further?  I have a MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015)
