WhatsApp Web in Fluid throws JavaScript exception <body> When I'm starting the WhatsApp web client in a Fluid app, this JavaScript exception is thrown:  precode[Error] TypeError: undefined is not an object (evaluating 'e.getDatabaseNames')     U (app_59f797fae4fc761b3ee8.js, line 63)     c (app_59f797fae4fc761b3ee8.js, line 62)     n (app_59f797fae4fc761b3ee8.js, line 6)     (anonymous function) (app_59f797fae4fc761b3ee8.js, line 6)     t (app_59f797fae4fc761b3ee8.js, line 5)     (anonymous function) (app_59f797fae4fc761b3ee8.js, line 5)     t (app_59f797fae4fc761b3ee8.js, line 5)     (anonymous function) (app_59f797fae4fc761b3ee8.js, line 5)     webpackJsonp (app_59f797fae4fc761b3ee8.js, line 5)     global code (crypto_8cbbef38a0cf6ff138dc.js, line 2) /code/pre  This leads an infinite loading screen.  When I launch WhatsApp Web in Safari codee/code is a codeIDBFactory/code, but it looks like the IndexedDB API isn't available in a Fluid app (there codee/code is null).  You have to set either Firefox, Chrome or Safari as user agent to get to the loading screen. I tried playing around with the settings, but nothing seems to help.  I wrote a mail to the FluidApp support, but no answer so far. Does anyone have advice?  <answer201396> I don't have a solution that works with Fluid, but Aluxian/WhatsApp-Desktop on GitHub provides an open-source wrapper for the WhatsApp web app which works well and provides similar functionality to what Fluid would.  <answer223795> Use this , very simple and elegant -   https://github.com/stonesam92/ChitChat  <answer228293> Stumbled upon the same, but I found a very good wrapper for whatsapp that feels very well integrated with OSX look&amp;feel: ChitChat. It being OSS is a great plus for me.  <comment242702> I'm running into just the same problem; unfortunately I don't have any solution. I also have emailed the developer of Fluid, but no response. <comment262060> I really hope Fluid does not become abandonware. But the latest twit on fluid twitter is 3 years old. I don't have high hopes that solution would be available. <comment271320> Answers on Ask Different need to be more than just a link. It's okay to include a link, but please summarize or excerpt it in the answer. The idea is to make the answer stand alone. <comment286808> One of the main reasons for using FluidApp is to get long lasting battery and use the internal webkit version. The open source suggestion is based on NW.js which uses V8 and Chrome internals, which defeats the purpose for so many Fluid users. <comment286809> This is very good. I wish all vendors had this approach, much like the one for facebook. https://fbmacmessenger.rsms.me -- which is also open source.
