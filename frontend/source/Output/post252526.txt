Strange white rectangles in Keynote <body> In Keynote, sometimes when I add a color-filled shape, white squares appear in both the preview and the different exports.  For example, this is a snapshot from the main editing window:  img src="https://s10.postimg.org/rr32njvsl/prob1.jpg" alt="original file"  In the exported pdf (and also when I press "play" or in the left thumbnail bar), I see this:  img src="https://s10.postimg.org/y623k82id/prob2.jpg" alt="output file"  Did anyone encounter this problem? Thanks a lot.
