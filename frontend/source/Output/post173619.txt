How not to have click twice to pause youtube videos <body> Im a complete new Mac user.   When I have a youtube video playing in safari window, and I'm typing an email in a different safari window, I have to click twice to pause the youtube video, once to focus the window, and once again to actually pause the video. But if I double click the video it will switch to full screen! I have to click twice with a pause...   Is there any configuration I can change so that I only have to click once?  I Googled the problem and I see a lot about "focus follows mouse" plugins, but I'm not sure if that's what I need, I just want the click to go through, instead of a "dedicated focus click", because that doesn't make much sense to me.  <answer173620> It is standard Mac behaviour - the first click activates the window, next click acts on the clicked object.  Since Yosemite, one or two aspects of the OS now seem to accept a first click - close boxes on unfocussed windows etc, but it's still not global.  <answer173622> You can kbd⌘ CMD/kbd+Click on pause button. By default kbd⌘ CMD/kbd+Click does not activate window under the click.  <answer173627> With some inspiration from Mateusz Szlosek answer, I downloaded MagicPrefs to hook up Two Finger Click to kbd⌘ CMD/kbd+Left Click. It does pretty much exactly what I want, the fact that I don't lose focus is actually pretty useful to.  Edit: already switched it to Three Finger Click because Two finger click gives to many false positives :)   <comment204273> Thx for the answer, that's pretty sad, do you know of any plugins that could fix this ? <comment204277> I always forget about that - I've learned to use it for window resizing, but 30 years of Mac without that feature has left me rather set in my ways ;) <comment204278> it's not perfect but it works ! Anyway I can make command click focus the window ? <comment204279> Mateusz has it - it's one I forget about, sorry ;) <comment204280> Cmd click specifically does not focus the window, it acts directly on where you click - it's relatively new behaviour, afaik <comment204281> @WillemD'haeseleer No, to bring window to focus You have to click again (without CMD). Tetsujin I think this worked in 10.6 also, maybe earlier.
