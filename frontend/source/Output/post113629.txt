ouc process running at 98% CPU <body> When I open a few different applications, the temperature quickly surpasses 200 F, however, when I'm working lightly, it is around 170 F.  It just seems like ever since I upgraded to Mavericks, it's heating up very often and fans go crazy, which is by design I guess.  I just don't know what this ouc process is and why it's using so much CPU.  I force quit it, but it comes back in a few minutes again.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DcLU8.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/q0HTI.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer113674> Given codeouc/code is not a process that ships with Mac OS X it appears a third party product is causing the problem.  Searching the web suggests codeouc/code is embedded within an application called "Mobile Partner.app".  If you have this application, please report the problem to the developers.  h2Manual Removal/h2  It is always better to use the removal process provided by the developer; however, if Mobile Partner does not provide a removal tool, you might like to disable the codeouc/code process manually.  You mention force quitting results in an immediate relaunching. This suggests the codeouc/code process is managed by a launchd job ticket. launchd is a watchdog process that will monitor processes and relaunch any that run into trouble - such as crashing or being force quit.  Take a look in the following folders for a launchd job ticket associated with codeouc/code:  ul li~/Library/LaunchAgents/li li~/Library/LaunchDaemons/li li/Library/LaunchAgents/li li/Library/LaunchDaemons/li /ul  The files in these folders are text files and can be read using TextEdit or a dedicated text editing tool, such as TextWrangler.  If you find a file mentioning codeouc/code, move it out of the parent folder and restart.  As @oma mentions, if you can not find a launchd job ticket, look inside code/Library/StartupItems/code for a folder or file containing codeouc/code. Delete the codeouc/code folder and restart.  <comment133393> Cool thanks.  It was indeed an app that I installed recently when I used wireless internet overseas.  It was used in conjunction with the USB internet stick made by Huawei and service provided by mtel ISP. <comment178698> i had the runouc issue where 97% CPU was used for this process, on the activity monitor i just selected the process and hit quit, my battery life became normal and the service sign on the battery went off <comment178699> I also have a Huawei USB modem and this same overheating issue with runouc running on the activity monitor. I forced it to quit and everything went back to normal. <comment178700> I am also having the same problem and am also using a Huawei USB modem. I have forced the item to quit, but it still starts up again from time to time. I have now manually removed the file as directed above. Seems to be much better. Thanks for the tips <comment201549> this didn't cut it for me. after long time (weeks) of this reoccuring, I found it here: `/Library/StartupItems`. Delete subfolder `StartOuc`. There are HW folders there too that I deleted. I'm staying away from Huawei from now on.
