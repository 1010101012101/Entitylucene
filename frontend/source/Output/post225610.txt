Can I get a 'modern' browser for Mac OS X (10.7.5) without upgrading to OS X El Capitan? <body> I am using Safari (6.1.6) for all my web use but certain sites I use often are telling me my browser is out of date. I gather Safari cannot be upgraded to a more modern status.    Having read the often less than complimentary reviews of 'El Capitan' which I assume would be the next logical step, I wonder if I can keep my OS X version but use another more up to date browser.  <answer225611> You can currently use Chrome, the world's most popular browser, but not for long. Google are dropping support for OS X versions before 10.9 from April of this year. A Chrome version you download now will keep working, of course, but it won't get updates.  However, it's unsafe to use the Internet from OS X 10.7.5, regardless of which browser you use. It's not received any security updates for years, so it's full of unpatched known vulnerabilities.  <answer237335> The Opera web browser is still up-to-date. It's what I'm using as my MacBook can't run anything newer than OS 10.7.5.  <answer237338> You have to accept that 10.7 is an extremely outdated operating system, and very few browsers will support it. El Capitan had some bugs when it launched, but those have mostly been ironed out.  Having said that, according to the Firefox page they still support 10.7.5 (and 10.6 even).  <answer237357> I find the website Cross Browser Testing really useful.  It give a matrix of operating systems and browsers and you can see which ones are supported.    For example you can click on 10.7 under the Mac OS X heading and then choose Safari in the browsers section and see that Safari 6 is the only version supported.  However, if you select just 10.7 you can see that there is a lot more versions available for Google Chrome, Firefox and Opera.    As the other answers suggest, I would be very careful running outdated software as they do have known security vulnerabilities. Have a look at the CVE Database for current known vulnerabilities for your software.  <comment273827> given security information which I was not aware of what do you think the best move to update my system and then use Google Chrome? <comment273830> Try FireFox, i think the latest version still works on 10.7.5. <comment273834> You should really upgrade to 10.11, although 10.10 would do. Then you can either use Chrome or Safari, since you'll have an up-to-date version of Safari. Macs are not suitable computers for people who want to keep the same OS version for years, since each OS X release only stays in support for about three years after it is released. <comment273840> Why not just update to El Capitan? It runs great on my 2009 MacBook Pro and includes many security updates. <comment290627> What "less than complimentary reviews" have you read that you feel are applicable to your particular situation? <comment326800> Latest version of 10.7 was released on September 19, 2012. Your "current software" scale is extremely short. <comment364333> No longer true. The Opera installer requires 10.9 or later. <comment364335> @RedEagle2000 Older Apple hardware will not run anything newer than 10.7.5. Updating the OS is not an option. <comment364336> @TomGewecke No longer true. Last version of Firefox on 10.7.5 is FF 48.0.2. <comment364357> @Rich I am aware of that. However, OP never stated what model of Mac he's using. <comment366672> @RedEagle2000 - Cool, but people finding this answer in a Google search are increasingly likely to have older hardware (sample size of one, me). Btw, I don't have the reputation to post an answer, but I recently found **Waterfox** which is still fully supported on 10.7.5. (https://www.waterfoxproject.org/) <comment373749> @MikeScott Cannot update to newer version, should I put my working mac in the bin? <comment373764> @SoufianeGhzal You should consider it, yes. You certainly shouldn't use it for online banking or anything else where security is critical. <comment373781> :( Ok, next machine will be a cheap still performant random linux one
