Rename terminal tab to host alias in ssh config <body> I am new to using Mac (Mac Pro, OS X 10.8.4) and I connect to many remote hosts using ssh. I have created aliases in .ssh/config file and would like to have the host alias as the name of the tab in terminal.  Can someone please advise on how it can be done?  Thanks much.  <answer101065> strongEDIT/strong: On Yosemite (OS X 10.10) use this instead:  precodefunction ssh ()  {       servername=$(echo $@ | sed -E 's|([- a-zA-Z0-9:/]+)( *[^@ ]*@)([^@ ]*)|\3|')      echo -ne "\033]0;${servername}\007";      /usr/bin/ssh $@ } /code/pre  Note that the function expects username and server name to be specified as codeuser@server/code (you can use the server IP address too: codeuser@a.b.c.d/code, the tab name will be set to codea.b.c.d/code). Other combinations like code-l user server/code won't work properly.  You can unset the function with:  precodeunset -f ssh /code/pre  hr  You can create a function named codessh/code that sets the terminal tab name and then invokes code/usr/sbin/ssh/code:  precodefunction ssh ()  {      servername=$(echo $@ | sed 's|\([- a-zA-Z0-9:/]\+\) *\([^-]\+@\)*\([-a-zA-Z0-9.]\+\)|\3|' | awk '{print $1}');     echo -ne "\033]0;${servername}\007";     /usr/bin/ssh $@ } /code/pre  ul licodeservername=$(echo $@ .../code  The first line extracts the server name from the arguments passed to codessh/code. I tested it against several possible codessh/code invocations with and without arguments but can't promise it's bullet proof./li licodeecho -ne "\033]0;${servername}\007";/code  The second line is where the magic happens. code\033]0;&lt;name&gt;\007/code is a ESCAPE sequence that sets the terminal tab name. See this Wikipedia article for more information - this particular escape code is listed in the non-CSI codes section./li licode/usr/bin/ssh $@/code  Start code/usr/bin/ssh/code with arguments provided./li /ul  Add the function to your code~/.bashrc/code file (if you don't use codebash/code modify it to match your shell syntax and add it to your shell's startup file) so that it's always accessible.  Note that it will also set the terminal tab name when executing a remote command:  precodessh user@server command /code/pre  for example:  precodessh jaume@myserver ls -l / /code/pre  <answer101067> You can use the LocalCommand argument in  your ~/.ssh/config file to run a bash or Applescript file that sets the tab name.  Bash Script: ~/.ssh/settabname.sh  precode#!/bin/bash  osascript -e 'delay 2' -e "tell application \"Terminal\" to tell window 1 to set custom title to \"$1\"" /code/pre  Your ~/.ssh/config file:  precodeHost * PermitLocalCommand yes  Host yourhostname LocalCommand ~/.ssh/settabname.sh yourhostname &amp; ... /code/pre  <comment210194> `ssh -p 3422 user@host` prints `-p` in tab title <comment210216> @efr Please check my edited answer. <comment210217> thank you `ssh -p 3422 user@host` now prints `host`
