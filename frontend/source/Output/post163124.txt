Recover font antialias on Yosemite <body> I've changed some options related to font rendering by codedefaults write/code command in past (I can't recall was it codelcdfilter/code, or something else). Now when I turn off antialiasing in system preferences font are still looks antialiased, but have less weight (see screenshots). img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/W5YrR.png" alt="1. With antialiasing" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1EZeP.png" alt="2. Without antialiasing" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sd3Ug.png" alt="2. With antialiasing" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/24Wfh.png" alt="2. Without antialiasing"  Note, I have Retina display, so, this could be normal behaviour, but I'm not certain, that's why I decided to ask about it. If this is not default behaviour (it seems to me, that fonts too heavy when antialiasing turned on), how can I rollback changed values to defaults?  <answer163125> You can change the amount of font smoothing with the following command:  precodedefaults write -g AppleFontSmoothing -int [value] /code/pre  code[value]/code is a value between 0 and 3 inclusive. Requires log out and log in.  Here's a gif by Lauri showing the difference:              img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RerO3.gif" alt=""   <comment190921> Oh, I suppose this is exactly the same command I've used, but what is actual default value? <comment190922> @Geradlus_RU `2` should be default. <comment190923> OK, I'll try it out now. __UPD__ I have 3 set for now. <comment190928> Well, I've changed value to `2`, logged out and in, but actually there is no difference. At least I know default value now, thanks!
