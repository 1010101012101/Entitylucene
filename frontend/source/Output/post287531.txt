Alternative way to backup WhatsApp <body> I recently changed my iCloud account and deleted every app except WhatsApp (which is attached to my old iCloud account). I'd like to keep everything (chat history, media, etc) as it is, but since I don't have enough space to backup to iCloud (it asks for at least 7.57GB and my 16GB iPhone has only 3.44GB free), I just can't do it. Is there any way to do it?
