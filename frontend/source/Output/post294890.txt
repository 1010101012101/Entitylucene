Safari stopped working in macOS High Sierra Beta 4 (17A330h) <body> Anyone have this happen? Safari stopped loading any pages I throw at it. Google, Reddit, Yahoo, CNN, you name it. The progress bar in the address bar sits at about 10% and doesn't move.  I have done the following:  ol liPreferences  Clear History  All/li liDeleted all com.apple.Safari related preferences./li liDeleted ~/Library/Safari folder./li liDisabled and deleted extensions./li liRestarted./li /ol  Is there anything I'm missing? Anything else I could try? Chrome and Firefox work just fine. I don't have any weird Little Snitch-esque software installed. No firewall. And Safari worked fine in previous betas.  I'll submit a bug report to Apple, but wanting to know if there's something obvious I'm missing.  <comment372677> I would submit to you that characterizing Little Snitch as weird may be a part of your problem!
