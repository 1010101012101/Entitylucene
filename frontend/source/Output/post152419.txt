How to select 2G as data network on iOS 8? <body> It is stated on the iOS 8.1 release notes that users can now select 2G, 3G or 4G LTE as their data network.   I've since updated to iOS 8.1 but I could not find where the option is to select 2G data network.   Where can I find this setting option?  <answer152420> It can be found in codeSettings &gt; Cellular &gt; Voice &amp; Data/code where in the option is available to select between 2G,3G and LTE.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fdW5S.png" alt="enter image description here"  If the voice option is not available for your iPhone. Please call and check with your respective service/carrier provider.  It's been noted that some of the carrier update for the iOS 8 has removed the "Voice &amp; Data" option because Apple let the carriers to update the cellular settings. It's only a matter of reverting back the update from the service/carrier providers.  <comment181674> I have Verizon Wireless (USA) CDMA-EvDO 3G service. I have a iPhone 6 running iOS 8.1, and I do not have the option to switch to the "2G" service, only LTE and 3G. As most people, I like to preserve my iPhone's battery life, so I would like to switch it to 2G, but for now it looks impossible to do.
