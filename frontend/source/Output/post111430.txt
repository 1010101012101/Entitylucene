Xcode and iOS SDK in iPad Air <body> I am a web developer looking to get started with apps for iPhone and iPad.  I have only an iPad Air 16GB. Can I install Xcode 5 and iOS SDK in the iPad for testing, while I code using a Windows PC?  <answer111433> You cannot install Xcode on iPad Air. You need to have a Mac to develop for iOS devices using Xcode and iOS SDK.  <answer129478> You can, but you'll need an OS X machine running and connected to the Internet in order to compile the builds for your iPad.  This is exactly how the Dringend app works (http://dringend.cc/).  It runs on your iPad as a slimmed-down 3rd-party Xcode replacement em(it even understands code.xcodeproj/code files!)/em, and uses Xcode via a remote OS X host to do the dirty-work.  I thought I read something somewhere about another start-up working towards a product with the same premise, but provides the OS X build-machines as a paid service— I'll update this if I find their name.  Until then, there's always OS X hosting.  <comment131124> To run Xcode (with the iOS SDK or OS X SDK), you need a Mac. You can't run Xcode on Windows or on the iPad. Apple does not provide any programming applications that run on an iPhone or iPad. See https://developer.apple.com/xcode/
