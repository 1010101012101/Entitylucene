/etc/fstab file no longer working when writing on a NTFS disk <body> My Macbook Pro runs 10.6.8 and I have a NTFS 500G disk. In order to write into the disk, I had tried to edit the code/etc/fstab/code file. It did work for years, but recently, I found it do not work and I don't know why.  Can anyone tell me why it has stop working and how to fix it?  I know installing some softwares can solve this problem, but I prefer to know why the code/etc/fstab/code file invalid now.  <answer95806> The NTFS driver (ntfs.kext) Apple supplies with OS X provides read-only access. You need to get a r/w driver, and your best bet is to get on by installing OSX FUSE (File Systems in User mode), from http://osxfuse.github.io/ and then the Tuxera NTFS driver (www.tuxera.com/products/tuxera-ntfs-for-mac/â€Ž), or the freeware NTFS-3G. Get the freeware version, and it works just fine. That should solve your problem.   <comment112427> This question appears to be off-topic because it is not about development.
