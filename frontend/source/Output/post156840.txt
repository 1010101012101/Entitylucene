Numbers: How do I write between in an IF statement? <body> I can't get the following formula to work in Apple's Numbers.app. I need the second codeIF/code to be codeBETWEEN 33.3% AND 66.6%/code.  This is what I have tried but it does not work:  precodeIF(D≥66.6%,"High","")&amp;IF(D&gt;33.3%&lt;66.6%,"Medium","")&amp;IF(D≤33.3%,"Low","") /code/pre  Thank you for any help!  <answer156841> Try this way:  precodeIF(D≥66.6%,"High",IF(D&lt;=33.3%,"Low","Medium")) /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nTNhz.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kR5d6.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment184413> I tried something similar to this, but unfortunately it still includes the second If when the first is met. I.e. all High percentages show as HighMedium.  I just tried this... `IF(D≥66.6%,"High","")&IF((D33.3%)+(D66.6%),"Medium","")&IF(D≤33.3%,"Low","")` It works but it shows a blue triangle with "The formula uses a Boolean in place of a number." <comment184414> This way works. Check the images. The only way to put two (or more) `IF` statements in the same cell is when they are nested. <comment184415> Ah thanks jherran! I still had the & operator between Ifs, I've just realised :) It works perfectly, thank you!
