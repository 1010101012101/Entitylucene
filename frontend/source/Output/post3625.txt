MacBook keyboard mod? <body> Is it possible to mod the MacBook keyboard to be backlit? Is there any website or business that can help or would do it for me?  <answer3632> you can always try to find yourself from this FlickR Photos and set it up :)  Flickr SET  Flickr SET SlideShow      How I used the backlighting from a macbook air, to give my white macbook a backlit keyboard.      You couldn't just change the whole keyboard, they're not compatible, but the lighting sheet fits.      Then you have to get nearly 16 volts from a step-up-converter to power the 5 white LEDs and add some electronics for switching it on/off and regulate the keyboard-brightness by the screen-brightness.      If you wanna have a backlit keyboard and think about doing it on your own: forget it and buy a new macbook with integrated backlight.   You would almost destroy your macbook in the process...   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/79yGf.jpg" alt="alt text"  <comment3362> In other news… the new Airs do not have backlit anymore. :S <comment3366> @Martín nope, saves battery and cables ... and on my opinion, ruins one of the best features of an Apple Laptop. <comment3380> wow that really sucks... I love the backlights. <comment3410> Okay, I'll wait until I can afford a Pro then...
