IOS 6.0.1 UnTethered Jailbreak <body> Is there an UnTethered Jailbreak for IPad 3 with IOS 6.0.1? I've been searching for a while but couldn't find one.  strongUPD/strong  There are some news on the topic  <answer76892> Currently there is no jailbreak for devices with A5, A5X A6, or A6X chips; Tethered or Untethered. This means we need to be patient for the Chronic Dev Team to complete the jailbreak for the IPhone 4S, 5, IPad 2, 3, 4 and Mini. Do not be fooled by any site that emaims/em to have it available. Most of them charge and may actually be viruses.  Check http://www.redmondpie.com for any updates. They will have realtime updates as to the status of the progress / release.   <answer81095> Great news! Jailbreak is now available
