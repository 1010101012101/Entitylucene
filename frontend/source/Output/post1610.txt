How can I assign more than 2 phone numbers to a contact on my iPhone? <body> A large proportion of contacts I have gained over the years have more than two current numbers.  Examples include: home, work, mobile; home, NZ work no., US work  no., Spanish work no; etc  I have only worked out how to add two numbers to particular contact; after that, when you click add there is no other options.  This is emcrazy/em, this is 2010, I must be doing something wrong, strongcan you help me out?/strong  <answer1612> I can add as many phone numbers as I want on the iPhone. When you're in edit mode in the contact, there's always a blank line under current phone numbers where you can start typing a new one.  If you click on the label of the number, you can select a label (work, home) and even a custom label if you scroll to the bottom of the label selection list.  <answer1632> When you enter a phone number for the contact, immediately below that number should appear a new place to enter another phone number. You can change the type of phone like work, home, iPhone, blackberry, etc.   <comment1903> So I haven't actually owned an iphone in about 6months but a friend recently got one and had this problem, and I remember being confused about it when I owned one. Has it always been like this, or are we just unimaginably thick? <comment1962> @SCdF - I think it has always been like this but I'm not sure either. My first iPhone was 3GS with iPhone OS 3. <comment70908> @JacobGorban My iPhone 4S has the entry "Add Custom Label" at the bottom of the label-picker screen, below all of my existing custom labels.
