Does CapsLock to Escape remapping in System Preference work? <body> I remapped my CapsLock to Escape in System Preferences, but it doesn't work. I had to install Karabiner and remap it using that. Is there a way to just remap CapsLock using just the settings without installing a third party software?  <answer266295> This isn't reproducible, it seems to work just fine.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5fupf.png" alt="caps -&gt; escape remapping"  <comment325272> "I remapped my CapsLock to Escape in System Preferences" How? Where? There's no pref to do that. <comment325273> @Tetsujin yes there is in macOS Sierra, but it isn't working for me. <comment325274> ah, ok, sorry - I haven't braved Sierra yet
