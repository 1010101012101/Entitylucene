How to entirely burn all 700MB of a CD while data is smaller? <body> I want the whole surface of the CD to be burned, is there a way to do this with a image disk for example or do I have to add junk ?  <answer35940> ol liCreate the disk image first..  As a sparseimage or a dmg, etc…  Just make sure it is the final size of your desired media…  (presets are available in the "New" panel.  /li liMount it.. Put what you want on it…/li liBurn it.  If it's a 700MB image… It'll get burned on all 700 MB./li /ol  Peace.  <comment40979> I'm curious, why do you need to do this? <comment40984> Microsoft [incuded Microsoft Bob](http://www.mydigitallife.info/microsoft-bob-free-download-on-every-windows-xp-cd-and-video-demo/) on every Windows XP disk; encrypted with the key thrown out for the same purpose. <comment41001> Are you sure ? I tried before and Toast showed the empty space. In Disk Utility I choose CD-ROM 80min but it corresponds to 660MB :-\ and if I choose 700MB I get a 717MB file in the end <comment41005> a 700 MB CDR is really only 660 MB in "reality".. sort of like a 32GB iPhone is really only 28.6 GB, or whatever. "there is a nearly 5% difference between the powers of 1000 definition and the powers of 1024 definition. Furthermore, the difference is compounded by 2.4% with each incrementally larger prefix (gigabyte, terabyte, etc.) The discrepancy between the two conventions for measuring capacity was the subject of several class action suits against HDD manufacturers"  You can [read about it on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive) <comment41119> @vcsjones, I was gonna flag your comment as spam because it was such a ridiculous statement. Then I clicked the link. Unbelievable. Now I've voted you up :-)
