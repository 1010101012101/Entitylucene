iTunes seems to be compressing my album art <body> | don't know which version it was before the new version started to compress image quality. I prefer my songs to have a high resolution album cover, like Rihanna's "LOUD" album cover, the cover is just plain awesome. However, when iTunes started to compress it, the image became very blurry, no more 'sharp' pixels. Is this permanent, or changeable by modifying a few files?  <comment146269> Could you show screenshots of both? The good and bad quality version? <comment146317> @Robuust I couldn't because I replaced the bad quality with the good ones. I could provide you this much details though - I usually choose image resolution on a scale of 1500 x 1500, which is around 200+ KB in size, but after some time iTunes compresses it to be 150 x 150.
