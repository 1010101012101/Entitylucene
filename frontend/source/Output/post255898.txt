How to remove the Dashboard animation? <body> I read this post regarding how-to-turn-off-all-animations-on-os-x.br But didn't find anything related to Dashboard animation.    In:  precodeSystem Preferences | Mission Control - [Keyboard and Mouse Shortcuts] /code/pre  I have codeShow Dashboard/code assigned to codeF12/code. When I hit that key, I can see an animation that brings the Dashboard widgets. I want to remove that concrete animation.  I am running Mac OS X Yosemite 10.10.3.
