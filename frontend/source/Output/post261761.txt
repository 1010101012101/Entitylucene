How to restore a time machine backup of a USB drive to a new USB drive? <body> One of my external USB disks died. I want to restore the time machine backup to a new (bigger) external USB disk.   I could just copy the latest backup to the new disk, but I want to keep the backup history, so that time machine uses the new disk as a replacement for the old disk (with all the backup history).  <answer262005> I found a solution that does use the existing backup. The trick is to use codesudo tmutil associatedisk/code (see codeman tmutil/code).  My old disk was mounted under code/Volumes/USB-old/code and the new disk is mounted as code/Volumes/USB-new/code. My backup is under code/Volumes/backups/code. (If your old and new disk have both the same name, you have to follow all of the steps, because the name of the disk is not sufficient to associate an old backup with a new disk)  ol liStop time machine to do backups (in the preferences)/li liRestore the old data to the new disk:  precodesudo tmutil restore /Volumes/backups/Backups.backupdb/MacBookPro/Latest/USB-old/* /Volumes/USB-new /code/pre  (note this does not restore files starting with code./code at the top level)/li liTell time machine to associate the new disk to the old backups:  precodesudo tmutil associatedisk /Volumes/USB-new /Volumes/backups/Backups.backupdb/MacBookPro/Latest/USB-old /code/pre/li liStart time machine to do backups/li /ol  Now time machine does not try to backup the entire new disk. Instead, it creates incremental backups based on the old snapshot.  However, it seems not possible to go back in history using Time Machine. I have tried to associate all old backups with the new disk without much success:  precodefor dir in `find /Volumes/backups/Backups.backupdb/MacBookPro -maxdepth 2 -name USB-old`; do      echo sudo tmutil associatedisk /Volumes/USB-new $dir done /code/pre  <comment328171> see also http://superuser.com/questions/65146/how-to-restore-a-failed-external-hard-drive-from-time-machine/1148703
