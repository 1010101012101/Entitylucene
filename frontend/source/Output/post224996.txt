XCode 5.1.1 crashes 10.9.5 Mavericks on Run (Mac project) <body> The project is a mere C++ command line application - writes a file, nothing fancy.  But if I set just one breakpoint this crash happens, and sometimes even without one.  Until recently I was using Xcode 4, and that was crashing every time I ran in the project. Then I saw that Xcode 4 is not supported on 10.9, so I upgraded to Xcode 5, Downloaded directly from Apple. But here's this strange result! Do you suppose Xcode 4 left some sort of debris behind?  Possibly relevant: after downloading  on first run, XCode couldn't be run because it couldn't identify the developer! After downloading Apple's app from Apple's own website! Anyone seen this behavior before? (I had to make a security exception even to run it.)  precodeProcess:         Xcode [2608] Path:            /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/MacOS/Xcode Identifier:      com.apple.dt.Xcode Version:         5.1.1 (5085) Build Info:      IDEFrameworks-5085000000000000~10 Code Type:       X86-64 (Native) Parent Process:  launchd [157] Responsible:     Xcode [2608] User ID:         501  Date/Time:       2016-01-25 20:20:16.627 -0800 OS Version:      Mac OS X 10.9.5 (13F1112) Report Version:  11 Anonymous UUID:  17B08F86-34D8-F57A-3C71-A57BE61051DF  Sleep/Wake UUID: F161D35E-5A98-4CA5-B904-F41FBFD54AAF  Crashed Thread:  0  Dispatch queue: com.apple.main-thread  Exception Type:  EXC_CRASH (SIGABRT) Exception Codes: 0x0000000000000000, 0x0000000000000000  Application Specific Information: ProductBuildVersion: 5B1008 UNCAUGHT EXCEPTION (NSInternalInconsistencyException): Error getting value for key 'workerClass' of extension 'Xcode.DebuggerFoundation.Debugger.LLDB' in plug-in 'com.apple.dt.dbg.DebuggerLLDB' UserInfo: {     NSUnderlyingError = "Error Domain=DVTPlugInErrorDomain Code=2 \"Loading a plug-in failed.\" UserInfo=0x7fab78453f40 {DVTPlugInIdentifierErrorKey=com.apple.dt.dbg.DebuggerLLDB, DVTPlugInExecutablePathErrorKey=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/PlugIns/DebuggerLLDB.ideplugin/Contents/MacOS/DebuggerLLDB, NSLocalizedRecoverySuggestion=The plug-in or one of its prerequisite plug-ins may be missing or damaged and may need to be reinstalled., NSLocalizedDescription=Loading a plug-in failed., NSFilePath=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/PlugIns/DebuggerLLDB.ideplugin, NSLocalizedFailureReason=The plug-in \U201ccom.apple.dt.dbg.DebuggerLLDB\U201d at path \U201c/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/PlugIns/DebuggerLLDB.ideplugin\U201d could not be loaded.
