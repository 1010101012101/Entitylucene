Why do Application Shortcuts in System Preferences disappear? <body> I have a longstanding issue with Application Shortcuts (ie. in System Preferences - Keyboard - Application Shortcuts). I can set up a new shortcut to a menu item of a specific application, eg. VoodooPad, and it shows up as expected, like so:img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rHK6G.png" alt="enter image description here"  This works correctly in the application.  But every such shortcut I have ever set up later disappears -- I'm not sure exactly when, but at some point the prefs pane reverts to the defaults (ie. just one entry for 'Show Help Menu', and the newly-added shortcut no longer works.  Anyone have any idea why?  <answer52169> precodeit sounds like someone has deleted your shortcuts or hit a restore defaults button. /code/pre  I recommend that you   ul lisetup time machine to save your preferences each hour. then you can use it to restore your preferences. that should help you identify the problem./li lisetup a shortcut that you will use daily (maybe ‚å•, to pull up system preferences)/li /ul  hope that helps regards   <comment59849> No-one else uses the machine, and it happens every time I set up an application shortcut, so I don't think it's a consequence of any kind of manual intervention. Something is clearly going wrong in how OS X is managing my application shortcuts, but I've as yet no idea what it might be.
