Import Voice Memos back to iOS <body> For some time ago, I've exported my voice memos from my iPhone to my Mac for back-up purposes using iExplorer and deleted the originals.  Now, again using iExplorer, I tried to copy them back to my iPhone, to their original place although nothing copied showed up under Voice Memos. Probably iOS has a database file concerning the recordings. I've the previous database as well but copying it will for sure mess up the current new recordings under iOS.  The web is crowded with how to export your voice memos to your Mac but no one is talking about how to import them back to your iPhone and since my try failed, is anyone aware of a possible solution?  <answer187973> You need to sync the voice memos via iTunes:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VOrSa.png" alt="enter image description here"
