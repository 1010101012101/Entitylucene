My fonts are sometimes displaying as Chinese/Japanese? <body> I am getting a problem with fonts on my machine sometimes showing as Chinese/Japanese characters (I'm not sure which).  This happens in many apps, although the ones where it is easily reproducable include Pages '09 (Mac App Store version):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/K9VHd.png" alt="enter image description here"  And in the "Type your password to confirm" dialogue box when installing applications:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZnAJa.png" alt="enter image description here"  I am running OS X 10.7.2 on a 27-inch, Mid 2011 iMac. I do not use any "Font management" apps although I've installed a few fonts from Font Squirrel in the past.  (I could not embed the images because I have no reputation on this site).  <answer38713> Sometimes this kind of problem can be solved by going to system preferences/language &amp; text/language and using the Edit button to uncheck the box for Japanese,  and then restarting.    <comment43802> Are you sure you have the proper localization settings? <comment43836> Yes, that worked! Thank you.
