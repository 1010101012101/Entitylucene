Where did "Find Album Artwork" go? <body> I just upgraded iTunes to version 12.4.1.6, and now when I right click on a song the option of "Find Album Artwork" is gone. I use that option when I add new songs that aren't imported with it. (I don't like the "find all" option because it messes up some custom artworks I've added) Thanks in advance.  <answer244322> It should still be there, just with a slightly different name: strongGet Album Artwork/strong.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iwW9w.jpg" alt="enter image description here"
