Monitor a folder for changes, and run a command when a change is detected <body> Is there a simple way to automatically run a (Terminal) command every time a file is changed in a specific folder?   This should be possible via the command line, or a system built-in application, no third-party applications.  Any ideas?  <answer40716> You might want to try something like this:  precodetouch /tmp/dirb.tmp while true do    ls /thedirtocheck &gt; /tmp/dira.tmp    diff /tmp/dira.tmp /tmp/dirb.tmp || echo "something changed"    cp /tmp/dira.tmp /tmp/dirb.tmp    sleep 100  done /code/pre  <answer40717> Automator has a type of workflow called a "Folder Action" which automatically runs when something is added to a folder. Create one, then use the action "Run Shell Script."  <answer40719> You could use Folder Actions, which lets you execute (Automator) scripts whenever contents in a folder change. As far as I know, Automator has a template that lets you easily create a new folder action and attach it to the desired folder. And by adding a "Run Shell Script" action, you should just get the desired effect.  <answer40727> Save a property list like this as code~/Library/LaunchAgents/test.plist/code:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC -//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;test&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;array&gt;         &lt;string&gt;say&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;string&gt;yy&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;/array&gt;     &lt;key&gt;WatchPaths&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;array&gt;         &lt;string&gt;~/Desktop/&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;/array&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  The agent can be loaded with codelaunchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/test.plist/code or by logging out and back in. Applying changes requires unloading and loading the plist.  Tilde expansion (code~//code) works in WatchPaths by default. EnableGlobbing adds wildcard and tilde expansion for ProgramArguments, but it doesn't affect Program or WatchPaths.  If a watched file is modified within ten seconds from the last invocation, a message like this is added to system.log:  precodecom.apple.launchd.peruser.501[146]: (test) Throttling respawn: Will start in 7 seconds /code/pre  One way to get rid of the messages is to add something like codesleep 10/code to the end of scripts. Setting ThrottleInterval to 10 doesn't help.  Changes in subfolders of watched folders aren't detected.  See codeman launchd/code and codeman launchd.plist/code for more information.  <answer95567> entr(1) is a utility for running commands when files change. It reads a list of file on STDIN and uses kqueue(2) to avoid polling.  Example:  precodels my_project/*.html | entr echo "file changed" /code/pre  <answer234330> Folder actions are fine for triggering when a file is added or modified.  However, if your definition of changed includes deleting a file, OSX Folder actions does not detect if a file has been removed.   strongTo answer the question:/strong  ol liDownload the FileWatcher dependencies from here: https://github.com/eonist/swift-utils/li liFamiliarize your self with running swift in the comandline: http://krakendev.io/blog/scripting-in-swift/li liUse this code to watch a folder./li /ol  strongCode:/strong   precodevar fileWatcher = FileWatcher(["~/Desktop/test/".tildePath])/*&lt;---the fileWatcher instance must be scoped to your class*/  fileWatcher!.event = { event in     Swift.print(self?.someVariable)//Outputs: a variable in your current class     Swift.print(event.description)//Outputs: a description of the file change } /code/pre  <comment46062> You need at least `ls -l` to catch file changes as well. <comment46072> Thanks, but it appears that "Folder Actions" are only triggered when a file is added to the folder, not when an existing file is checked. <comment46073> Thanks, but it appears that "Folder Actions" are only triggered when a file is added to the folder, not when an existing file is checked. <comment46074> possible duplicate of [How can I run/stop/relaunch an application automatically, at boot/login/some other time?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3030/how-can-i-run-stop-relaunch-an-application-automatically-at-boot-login-some-oth) <comment46075> Another dupe? http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/6658/checking-for-folder-file-changes-using-automator <comment46104> right.... missed that <comment46162> Oh, okay.
