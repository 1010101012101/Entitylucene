Open resource from inside the bundle using c++ / qt <body> I have a Qt app set as a bundle, and it requires a resources database. If I place it inside the bundle, how do I open it ?  The app was created in Windows, and in Windows and Linux, I can use the path for the database:   precodefopen(path, r); /code/pre  I can do the same thing in Os X with a path like "code/Users/Me/Company/Product/resources.db/code" or "code/Library/Application Support/Compay/Product/resources.db/code"  1) What path would I use for the resources.db if I want to place the database in codeContents/Resources/code ?  2) Would I be able to do anything to access the location using an Open File Dialog ?  <answer153951> Being that the app structure in OSX is flat it should not matter where you put anything, other than for your own organization purposes.  <comment182159> Took me a while to figure out that you are technically correct, after I was able to get an absolute path to the Contents/Resources folder.
