Is there a way to display an on-screen alert like the volume control feedback? <body> I am building some home theater integration, using my Mac Mini as a central hub. I have figured out how to use the HTTP or raw TCP/TP commands on my home theater equipment to turn them on, off, volume up/down, etc.  What I would like to do is have a way of displaying a message (mainly the volume of the receiver, "Volume: 58%") when I invoke the controls to increase the volume.  But I can't even figure out what those dialog/notification styles are called, nor how I might be able to display one. (Yes, I could use the notification service, but I'm not happy with it.) (Growl is another option, but that relies on having Growl installed.)  I would most prefer a simple terminal or AppleScript command to display the message.  Any tips?
