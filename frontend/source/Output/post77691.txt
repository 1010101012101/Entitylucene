Does anyone know a decent app to monitor bandwidth usage, ideally from the terminal? <body> I'd like to monitor my bandwidth usage on my Macbook pro, and keep logs of it. Ideally, I'd like to view/monitor them via the Terminal. Can anyone recommend me some applications?  EDIT: To clarify, I want to keep a time-series graph of the bandwidth I/O  <answer78941> I can recommend Netlimiter. While it is both a GUI and paid software I liked it a lot during my Windows days and found it to be pretty good on OS X too. The only reason I didn't buy a license was that for my usage it's a want and not a need. :)  <answer79108> I decided to go with ntop following installation guidelines from here.  <comment90013> See also: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/41364/how-can-i-use-terminal-to-monitor-a-network-interfaces-total-traffic-in-mb?rq=1 <comment90050> I already did look at that question. But it wasn't really helpful. I just wanted to keep graphs of bandwidth I/O in a time-series graph.
