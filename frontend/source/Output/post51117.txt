Lion iCal calendar event shows up as grey rather than colour of calendar it belongs to <body> I have an item in iCal that shows in grey rather than the (blue) colour of the calendar it belongs to.  It also has an interrupted border rather than a flawless border.  What does that mean?  Update: It shows up in the correct colour (blue) on the Web interface.  <answer51130> If someone has sent you an invite and you have responded "Maybe", the Event will show up as described.   <comment58474> I created the event and sent an invite and the response was positive. <comment58475> Hmm, that's the only circumstance I've seen what you describe. <comment87491> This may sound funny... but have you maybe somehow invited yourself? Because @afragen is right: Grey means - it's an invitation to you, which hasn't been accepted yet.
