Directory Services with OpenLDAP <body> I have an OpenLDAP instance running on Amazon AWS.  I've got a few users and groups set up, I'm able to use ldapsearch from my macbook to bind and search the server.  I would like was trying to add my OpenLDAP server as a node in my Directory Services, and I provided all the necessary information, but it will not connect giving the oh so informative  precodeConnection failed to node  '/LDAPv3/XX.XXX.XXX.X'  &lt;--IP address hidden for security purposes (2100) /code/pre  I've tried to debug this with dcsl (granted I just learned what it was today) and I can see the new node  precode$ dscl Entering interactive mode... (type "help" for commands)  &gt; ls /LDAPv3/ XX.XXX.XXX.X /code/pre  but if try to do anything with the node (cd, list, read, etc.), I get this:  precodeInvalid Path &lt;dscl_cmd&gt; DS Error: -14009 (eDSUnknownNodeName) /code/pre  why is the nodename unknown? what am i doing wrong
