Remember Kerberos tickets after reboot <body> I need to use Kerberos to connect to my network at work. The built-in codekinit/code and codessh/code in Lion work fine for me. However, I need to get a new ticket and re-enter my password every time I restart the computer. Is there a way to make it remember the ticket after reboots (until it actually expires)?  <answer61478> By default, the kerberos ticket cache is placed under /tmp, which is cleared out on reboot.  You can specify your own location for the ticket cache, in a location safer for long term storage, by passing the "-c" flag to kinit, and setting KRB5CCNAME to point to the same location, so ssh will use it.  precode$ kinit -c ~username/mykrbcache $ export KRB5CCNAME=~username/mykrbcache $ ssh kerberoshost ... $ reboot ... $ export KRB5CCNAME=~username/mykrbcache $ ssh kerberoshost ... /code/pre
