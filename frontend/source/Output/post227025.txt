How to remap a single key in Language Input <body> I am pretty new to Macs and these days I've been experiencing the whole frustration that comes when switching from Windows to Mac.. All my favourite shortcuts are so different or non-existent an so on..  I can live with that, there is a learning curve and I will get used to it (even though I used Karabiner to remap some shortcuts, there are plenty to learn :) )  Here comes the real question here. I am also using the Bulgarian keyboard, one of those cyrillic keyboards that have more letters than the normal keyboards can fit. On Windows though I had one letter (ч) which is under the kbd`/kbd. It is in the same key on the Mac, with the sole difference it is located..next to kbdLeft Shift/kbd so it is super hard to reach.  Can I somehow remap the ч key to kbd§/kbd ?  I tried with Karabiner, but didn't manage to do it (maybe I missed something).  <answer227033> If you are using the Bulgarian phonetic keyboard layout you can simply enable a Karabiner preset. Search for "Bulgarian" and enable "map ч to ±":  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9HnkK.png" alt="karabiner"  <comment275723> Questions regarding keyboards settings are often hard to comprehend. Especially non-latin alphabets. Do you use a special (physical) keyboard with more keys or only a normal Mac keyboard with a physical Bulgarian Mac layout and the logical Bulgarian input source? <comment275724> I am using the MBP's keyboard, which has only Latin alphabet written on it. I believe it is the EU version(@ sign is on the 2, it has the vertical "Return" key) <comment275725> Hmm there are at least 12 different physical latin Mac keyboard layouts. What do you mean with "one letter which is under the "\`"". Is it a "`" (which is no "letter" but a dead key and has to be used with another key e.g. a -  à) or does it look different? <comment275726> When writing in English it produces the corresponding sign - ( ` ), but when typing in Bulgarian it produces ( ч ). There are few Bulgarian letters which are produced from the "symbol" keys due to insufficient "letter" keys. Here are the buttons I am talking about - on the Mac keyboard it is the one in red circle. [Mac keyboard link](https://i.imgsafe.org/9ab09f6.jpg) and on the Windows one it is the one just above the "Tab" button - [Windows keyboard](https://mpackatina.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/799px-bulgarian_phonetic_layout-svg.png) <comment275727> OK I got it - testing on my German keyboard. It seems to be a "dead" key but in fact it's some kind of a modifier key which creates a 3rd level of letter keys (similar to the shift key: non-caps - capitalized letters). <comment275728> So maybe I am looking for a solution which could(possibly?) interchange the wanted key with the one actually found above the "Tab" key on the MBP's keyboard ? <comment275729> Karabiner already contains a preset to map ч to §/±.
