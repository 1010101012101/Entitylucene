Force Mail.app to show manual configuration options <body> Now that Outlook.com supports IMAP email I'd like to set up Mail.app (on OS X 10.7.5) to use it rather than POP for that account. I have it set up on my Windows and Android machines, so I know it works.   The issue is that Mail's auto configuration only detects the POP servers when I try to add a new account, and there are no manual configuration options to set up the IMAP details. Is there any way to add an account and show the necessary configuration options?   <answer102706> strongtl;dr - Enter an emincorrect/em password when setting up the account for the first time/strong  hr  ol liOpen strongMail/strong → strongAccounts…/strong./li liClick the strong+/strong to add an account.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kNq5j.png" height="40"/li liSelect strongAdd Other Mail Account…/strong and click Continue.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/g8FU1.png" height="40"/li liWhen the password is emrequired/em, enter an strongincorrect/strong password.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/znLRE.png" height="40"/li liIt will request that the account be configured manually.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LVbkY.png" height="70"/li liFollow the instructions to add your mail configuration.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uWOBm.png" height="150"/li /ol  <answer112743> Note: Possibly only relevant in Lion, Mail.app v.5.3br / Turns out it's bypassable if you hold alt down. The "Create" button then changes to "Continue".  Not entirely on-topic protip: alt often changes the behavior of buttons to allow "power-users" to actually get things done which lusers probably shouldn't be bothered with. Try it on some menubar-items, e.g. the volume.  <comment120873> Do you set it up as an "other" type mail account? That should give you the option. <comment120875> Nevermind I just realized you're not talking about iOS. Duhh sorry. <comment120876> Try leaving password blank when you first enter info. Worked on 10.7.8 at least. <comment120882> Hmm, Mail appears to remember the password despite the account having been removed and the computer restarted. If I leave the password blank it connects anyway which seems... wrong. <comment120883> looks like you have a solution below for that now! <comment120884> This isn't what I'm getting. When I leave the password blank it connects to the POP server anyway. That seems wrong... The account was previously set up as a POP account in mail, before I deleted it to reconfigure. Would that make a difference? <comment120886> @velvetkevorkian Instead of leaving it blank, try entering a random *incorrect* password. <comment120887> Ah, that seems to do the trick. How intuitive. Thanks!
