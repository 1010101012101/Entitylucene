How can I recover lost secure notes in Keychain? <body> I have been having problems is Messages.  One post suggested chucking your codelogin.keychain/code.  This caused my secure notes to vanish.  Restoring this file from time machine (code~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain/code) did not help.  In answer to comment below:  Quit Keychain Access Renamed login.keychain Restored from the 7:31 backup this morning. Restored code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple/keychainaccess.plist/code   Restarted Keychain Access  No secure notes.  Mac OS 10.10 Yosemite  <answer269808> Stupid, silly me.  The left column has a pane for Keychains and a pane for categories.  The keychain pane has   ul lilogin/li lilocal items/li liSystem/li liSystem Roots./li /ul  The Category pane has  ul liAll Items/li liPasswords/li liSecure Notes/li liMy Certificates/li liKeys/li liCertificates./li /ul  These two are in essence multipied together.  That is, ANY of the keychains can have any of the categories.  In my wanderings I was somehow clicked into local items instead of login.  I had not created a local items secure note, so of course secure notes was blank.  Embarrassing as it is, I'm leaving this up for future klutzes.  <comment338990> What exactly did you do and what do you mean by "*did not help*"?
