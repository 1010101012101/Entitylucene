Repeatedly asked to install firmware update 1.8 <body> In the last few days I have seen the same update keep appearing in my App Store updates list. The details are:  Software Update: MacBook Air SMC Firmware Update 1.8  "This update address a rare issue on some Apple notebooks where a battery..."  I'm on a Mid-2011 Macbook Air running OS X 10.9.  I have installed the update and the machine reboots as expected, but then a day later the App Store prompts me to install the same update again.  Is there a way to reset or somehow suppress this so I don't keep getting asked?  <answer111054> Right click on update - Hide update.  <comment131397> I just had to install it twice and it went away.
