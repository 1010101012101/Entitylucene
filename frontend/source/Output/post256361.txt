Mac Pro 1.1 not grounded correctly <body> (I'm not sure if I should ask this question here or on Electrical Engineering, but decided to ask here, because it is very Apple specific)  So I had a rough evening: My Mac Pro 1.1 (A1186) sort of exploded..  I'm not sure what exactly happened but here's what I know: I bought the Mac used off of eBay (so any "go to an Apple Store and let them fix it is off the table) and upgraded the GPU to a new GTX 760 (bought a aftermarket cable  adapter "Apple PCIe Power" to "Standard PCIe Power") and installed El Capitan. Everything worked flawless. A couple of days ago the Mac gave me a small electric shock but I thought it came from me, not the Mac. Today I wanted to recharge my remote Trackpad using a standard 5V USB charger and put the trackpad on the Mac while it charged.  A couple of minutes later the trackpad (still connected) sent my mouse flying all across the screen, so I wanted to turn it off. When I lifted it up, it gave me shock and I let it fell back onto the Mac. A flashing light and loud sound later the lights in the flat went out and it smelled like burned hair.. Fuses in my flat went out, so I disconnected the Mac from power, put them back in and then disconnected everything from the Mac and put the power cable back in. I turned it on and it started like nothing ever happened.   But what I found out: If something connected to a power outlet is plugged in (even something like an external hard drive with extra power), if I slide another e.g. USB cable alongside the chassis, I can clearly see sparks. The Mac itself isn't connected to power.  TL;DR: My Mac had a shortcut and it seems like the chassis isn't grounded correctly. I know there had been issues with something like that on "older" MacBook Pros, so maybe someone has an idea on why this is happening. What could be the reason? Is this a more or less common problem? Is there a way I can resolve it (I'm not an electrician obviously)?
