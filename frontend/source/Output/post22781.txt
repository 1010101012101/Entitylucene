PC to Mac - Remote Desktop <body> I want to connect to my mac remotely from my Windows PC. What good products are there available that you recommend checking out?  <answer22783> h3VNC/h3  Recent versions of Mac OS X include a VNC server built-in, analogous to Microsoft's Remote Desktop Server (included in Windows). This can be accessed via the emSystem Preferences  Sharing  Apple Remote Desktop/em option.  There are various free VNC clients available for Windows, most notably emRealVNC/em.  While there are other options, VNC benefits from being a very mature graphical remote-access protocol with official support from Apple and good-quality client programs.  <answer22815> I've tried them all and RealVNC is the best by far. Anything else either lacks important functionality or lags miserably. I recommend you try them all though and decide for yourself; it really comes down to what level of remote control you're looking to have.  <answer22816> For quick helpdesk applications I use Teamviewer (https://www.teamviewer.com/)  <answer22873> This is a full list I found on Wikipedia comparing remote desktop software.  <answer23320> I emhighly/em recommend LogMeIn.  It is the fastest remote access program to Mac I've tested.  <answer64216> I'm currently using TightVNC to do the same thing.  Lately it has started randomly dropping my connections though.  I can get them back easily enough, but it's very annoying.  Started with the OS X 10.8.1 update so I'm not sure if it's TightVNC or OS X that's got the problem.  <comment25438> I'm enjoying this [ScreenShareMenulet](http://klieme.com/ScreenSharingMenulet.html) program as a quick way to call up machines in my network running VNC or Bonjour desktop sharing. <comment75703> I did more testing and can't recommend TightVNC on current OS X installs due to repeated session drops.  RealVNC works fine, no drops at all. <comment80605> Big downside to VNC is not being able to match up screen sizes very well.  Mac desktop won't autosize to your remote screen.  You'll have to try to find a resolution close enough to not be crazy annoying (or live with scaling). <comment80606> Not a big fan of that solution.  Introducing a 3rd party increases the security risks.  If you're in a corporate environment that'll be a huge no-no. <comment80612> @BrianKnoblauch: That's indeed annoying. Still, good solution in many cases. <comment98439> In a corporate environment support are likely to have a tool to do this (often LogMeIn or Teamviewer) <comment142986> VNC is slow!!!!
