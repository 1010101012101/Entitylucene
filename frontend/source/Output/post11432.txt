How can I change the preferred application for opening "fmp7://" URLs from FileMaker Pro Advanced to FileMaker Pro? <body> I have both FileMaker Pro and FileMaker Pro Advanced installed. Because the available licenses for the Advanced product are limited, I shouldn't use it unless necessary. But when neither application is running, my Mac will currently open any "fmp7://" URLs in FileMaker Pro Advanced. How do I change this so that FileMaker Pro is opened instead?  (There's no obvious configuration option for this in either application's Preferences window.)  <answer11438> Download and install the excellent RCDefaultApp Preference Pane, which — amongst other things —  lets you declare the default handler for fmp7:// URLs.  <comment95573> That pref pane looks pretty old. Any info / experience on whether it works under OS X 10.6, 10.7, 10.8? <comment95651> @gosmond seems to work fine for me under OS X 10.8.2!
