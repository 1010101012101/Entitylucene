What might be causing Safari 6.0.2 to crash several times a day? <body> Safari 6.0.2 randomly crashes on me several times a day. Today I checked the console logs after it crashed, and only found this:     objc[2339]: Object 0x7f9b7b41cab0 of class NSUserDefaults autoreleased with no pool in place - just leaking - break on objc_autoreleaseNoPool() to debug   I'm running OS X Mountain Lion 10.8.2. Any ideas as to what may cause this, or can anyone point me to logs where I can find more information? This never happened before in OS X Lion.  strongUpdate/strong This issue occurred again a few days ago, and I few a more informative error message:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wqyCX.png" alt="enter image description here"  It appears to have been due to me having an older version of the 1Password Safari extension which had a bug with Mountain Lion. I thought I had the latest version because I had the latest version of 1Password installed, however to update the browser extension, you need to run the browser install again. I think this may relate to the issue I experienced. I'll see how this runs for a few more days before declaring this as the true solution.  <answer71338> It appears to have been due to me having an older version of the 1Password Safari extension which had a bug with Mountain Lion.

Even if you don't know it's right, it helps others see a potential answer instead of a question that is confusing (one with both Q and A in it)
