Automatically shrink existing Time Machine Backup to a fixed size <body> I googled for hours to find a solution for this issue, but I couldn't find an answer that fitted for my problem.  My setup:  ul liI have an iMac with a ~1TB Hard Drive/li liI'm backing it up via Time Machine to a Synology NAS DS214+ with ~2.7TB Space/li /ul  My problem:  ul liI forgot to set a size limit for the backup user. No my Time Machine Backup uses about 2.3TB space. That's not cool./li liI can't set a quota to the Synology user, because it beginns to count starting zero./li /ul  What I want to do:  ul liIf anyhow possible I want to tell my Time Machine Backup to shrink automatically to a limit of ~1.5TB by deleting the oldest backups./li liThen I want the sparse bundle to not get bigger anymore./li /ul  Does anyone of you see a solution? Or do I have to delete emall my old backups/em to reach my goal?  <answer184553> Shrink the backup volume to the desired size. Time Machine is designed to keep adding backups until the volume is full, then prune older copies. It is NOT designed to share storage space with other things, nor to leave X gigabytes free on the destination.  <answer184629> I agree with the answer given earlier, though what you could try is to manually delete Time Machine backups (at your own risk).  If you mount the volume, there is a folder called "Backups.backupdb" (it may be looking slightly different on remote backups).  Inside it will have your computer name and then either the dates or the volumes, or vice versa (sorry, I am currently away from my own Mac and cannot check the exact order).  If you remove some earlier date folders, you will free up some space in order to resize the volume.  strongNOTE:/strong Keep in mind that Time Machine is an incremental backup using hardlinks for unchanged files.  So, removing one date folder, may not remove the amount of space it states to be sized at.  <comment218812> Just FYI: I'm using OS X Yosemite 10.10.3 and the current firmware on my Synology NAS. <comment218832> Well, I can't shrink the volume, because it already takes more space than wanted. That's my problem. <comment281196> [This site](https://dzone.com/articles/shrink-your-time-machine) says to delete your backups using `sudo tmutil delete`. <comment369404> how would you shrink the volume?
