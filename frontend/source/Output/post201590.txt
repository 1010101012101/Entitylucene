uconv on Mac OS X anywhere? <body> Is the strongemuconv/em/strong utility (a tool from ICU that provides Unicode normalization) available for Mac OS X?   I did not find it in strongemhomebrew/em/strong and searching the web for solutions did not turn out anything useful for me.  <answer201591> Not sure if it will suit your needs, but check out codeiconv/code which is coming with osx. Try codeiconv --list/code to list the supported encodings.  <answer213163> My solution for you:  codebrew install icu4c/code  Read the message after install (nothing is at this moment direct available ...):     == Caveats,    This formula is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local.   codebrew list icu4c | grep uconv/code     /usr/local/Cellar/icu4c/55.1/bin/uconv      /usr/local/Cellar/icu4c/55.1/share/man/man1/uconv.1   And after all, here my example for using this tool for normalization (NFC) utf8 text:  code/usr/local/Cellar/icu4c/55.1/bin/uconv -f utf-8 -t utf-8 -x NFC ~/Desktop/ue.txt |  od -t x1/code  <comment243022> It looks like iconv only converts between character sets. Uconv converts text (unicode only) from one form to another equivalent form. <comment243024> What are you trying to do? `man iconv` states "The iconv program converts text from one encoding to another encoding." `man uconv` says "uconv converts [...] from one encoding to another" <comment243025> I am trying to convert to unicode's NFD (see above ref for Unicode normalization). <comment243027> You may do so using `iconv -f from_encoding -t UTF-8-MAC input`. Note that the `utf-8-mac` character set stands for unicode's NFD <comment243029> Thanks!! This prompts two more questions: Can iconv also converts to Unicode NFC? And where is it documented that UTF-8-MAC stands for NFD? <comment243035> Yes, it can. Use `UTF-8` for unicode's NFC. I found out using google, leading me to [this](http://serverfault.com/a/427200). Not sure where it's documented. <comment309057> `utf-8-mac` is not NFD but a [variant of NFD used by HFS+](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/qa/qa1235/_index.html) where certain ranges of characters are not decomposed. `printf \\uf900|/usr/local/opt/icu4c/bin/uconv -f utf-8 -t utf-8 -x NFD|xxd -p` prints `e8b188` (which is decomposed) but `printf \\uf900|iconv -f utf-8 -t utf-8-mac|xxd -p` prints `efa480` (which is not decomposed).
