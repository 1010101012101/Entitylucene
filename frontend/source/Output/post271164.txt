Split Input Channels Using SoundFlower and AULab <body> I want to split my stereo input channels so I can Eq one of them. They both would then go to the built-in output. I've installed SoundFloser and AU Lab on Mac OS 10.12 Sierra. I've read through the help pages for AU lab. I couldn't find anything specific to my need. With all the options, it looks like it should be possible. I've tried selecting two mono inputs. I get two left channels as input. I didn't see any way to change the source of the mono input, but I could have missed it.  <answer271194> I could be done using Rogue Amoeba's Audio Hijack which is ostensibly an audio recorder but has really comprehensive routing capabilities too.  You build your path just by drag &amp; drop, it makes the connections for you.  Route a source to two different Channels plugins, kill left in one &amp; kill right in the other - that way each will pass only a single side of the stereo pair.br In front of that you put two EQ plugins, then route both to a single output, headphones/speakers etc.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jCcTt.png" alt="enter image description here"  It's fairly expensive for a one-trick pony, but it's extremely useful if you need the trick it can do.  I posted more examples on https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/203009/85275  BTW, remember to switch it on once you've built it ;-) Button bottom left goes white &amp; the numbers go orange &amp; start to count time.br As a side-effect, launching any specific Hijack preset will launch any apps assigned to it.  <comment340856> It must be done in SoundDkower and AU Lab? Anything else an option (GarageBand, premiere, audition, Logic)? <comment340870> I'm not picky about the method. AU Lab was the first I found. I just want to adjust one channel's output to my headphone to help with a hearing loss. The only input I really care about is from iTunes. <comment341414> I'm not going this route, but it is an answer to the question. <comment341646> After spending hours trying to find a way to get AU Lab to work, I gave Audio Hijack a try. It was real easy to set up and did what I wanted. I did have to pay $50 for the application. If you have normal hearing Soundflower and AU Lab should be fine. <comment341649> Glad you got your solution - as I said, one-trick-pony, but it's a very well-crafted one trick.
