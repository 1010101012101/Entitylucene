How to find offending Finder Extension? <body> I'm constantly (about every half second) getting this error on my MacBook Pro's console flooding my system log...  I've tried to kill all processes in hopes to find the offender, but no luck so far.  strongWould anyone know how I can definitely find the exact Extension name? Is there a reference or command that will reveal such information?/strong     Error details:      2016/01/08 13:55:50.398 FinderSyncExtension[1420]: assertion failed: 15C50:  libxpc.dylib + 35399 [61AB4610-9304-354C-9E9B-D57198AE9866]: 0x13      2016/01/08 13:55:50.398 FinderSyncExtension[1420]: failed to create remote port   <answer222648> After shutdown (emnot reboot/em) and cleanly booting up, I saw the system log show the name of the extension: odrive (www.Odrive.com).  I found an update for the extension and upgraded. This resolved my flooded system log issue.  <answer228262>    FinderSyncExtension[1420]   I had a similar problem. I found that the number in the sqqare brackets is the process ID number of the offending process.  In your example, strongps ax 1420/strong should identify the process.  In my case, it turned out to be the Box Sync app.  <answer228601> I found the offenders in my case (plural, for several apps were using this plugin), using a codeps -axe | grep FinderSyncExt/code .  Before removing the apps using it from my code/Applications/code folder, I decided to kill each of the processes using a codekillall -9 FinderSyncExt/code.  <comment278419> I simply ran "console" from the home screen to see the system logs. Alternately, you could run this from terminal:  `tail /var/log/system.log`
