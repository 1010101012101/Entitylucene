Can an app that runs on iPad be forced to be displayed in iPhone's resolution or aspect ratio? <body> The example is Pokemon Go: when it is running on the iPad Pro, almost everything is fine, except you cannot see part of the upper screen and part of the lower screen.  As a result, in a gym battle, when your move is super good or super bad, the message at the top of the screen cannot be seen. And when you try to catch a Raid boss, the number of Premier balls remaining at the bottom of the screen cannot be seen either. (unlike iPhone).  So can you force the app to run on the iPad Pro like it is an iPhone app (or use the iPhone's screen aspect ratio)?
