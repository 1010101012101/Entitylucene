TimeZone Issue during DayLight Saving <body> I just been bugged by the Day light saving hours   I seem that code3rd November 2013 01:00:00/code start EST time   Now ever Time I set my time to 3rd November 2013 00:58:xx(some seconds)   and run codedate/code   it give me valid Time zone i.e codeEDT/code   but   even after the time pass 01:00:00 and I still query the date library   I still see the Time zone as codeEDT/code and not codeEST/code  have a look at this screenshot img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Q5j2H.png" alt="enter image description here"  You can clearly see the Time zone saying as EDT even when it is EST   any one has a clue for this   h2Update/h2  There is one other finding I found if I restart my machine I see this  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WysWD.png" alt="enter image description here"  h2More Update/h2  Before Restart     img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5VYUo.png" alt="enter image description here"  After Restart     img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SgaUi.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer108157> What was the current time and timezone when you set the clock ?  In any case, use codedate -u/code to figure out what exactly the system clock is set to.  EST time doesn't start at 01:00 but at 02:00 which turns to 01:00 EST.   <comment126807> Just a note: copy/pasting text from the console would have been enough. Why the screenshots? <comment126808> To prove the downvoter that whatever I saying is correct <comment126809> see the Update now even I miffed with the fact that if the EST is suppose to start at 2:00 why is it showing EST for time that follow in 01:xx window <comment126810> Both 1:00 EST and 1:00 EDT do exist. <comment126811> Sorry didn't get what you meant in last comment <comment126812> I mean there are different two period of time from 1am to 2am, one of each being EST so you can't write EST starts at 2:00 without specifying which 2:00. <comment126856> `s/different two/two different/`
