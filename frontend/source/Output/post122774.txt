Upgraded 10.9.1 to 10.9.2 now SD cards not recognized <body> On early 2011 MacBook Pro 15inch -- I use the SD card slot a lot. Suddenly after the upgrade to 10.9.2 (for security reasons), now inserting an SD card gets no reaction, instead of showing an icon on the desktop for the new mounted volume.  <answer122944> try another brand of sd card, I had this problem with sandisk cards but al others would work perfectly. You can also try wiggling it around a bit after a while it would read my cards if I did that. Just don't break the card ;)  <answer130497> same problem' was working, now not. 2 brands of card tried. wiggled without success. am I going to have to resort to the abandoned PC in the corner? this is deffo a 10.9.2 problem.  <comment143301> Have you already checked the Finder's Preference settings (Cmd-comma)? <comment143460> Yes, Finder Preferences is set to show everything. <comment143735> I have currently handy only Transcend and SanDisk cards. I've tried both and the result is the same: not recognized. And this started only when I upgraded to 10.9.2 recently. <comment143801> and when you wiggle it around a bit? <comment144037> Eureka. That did it. Must have gotten dirt on the contacts -- now they're clean and the problem is gone. Weird of course that this happened simultaneously with the MacOS upgrade, but clearly that was a coincidence. Thanks, Dennis!! <comment144165> woohoo:P you're welcome.
