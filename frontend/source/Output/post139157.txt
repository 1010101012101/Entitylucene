Restore Macintosh HD to its original partition configuration <body> I seem to have badly botched a Boot Camp installation of Windows 8.1.  I used Boot Camp Assistant to create a 200 GB BOOTCAMP partition on my 1 TB Fusion Drive.  I then rebooted and failed to install Windows because I did not know at the time that having my external backup drive plugged in would cause the Windows installer to not work.  From the Windows setup partition tool, I tried formatting the BOOTCAMP partition.  That did not help, so I tried deleting it and creating a new partition in its place.  That did not work either, which leads me to where I am now.  I have a ~800 GB Macintosh HD partition and a 200 GB Free Space partition I need to get rid of to be able to give Boot Camp another go.  These are depicted below.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EAV6E.png" alt="Macintosh HD partition I would like to extend" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/v1qZT.png" alt="Free Space partition I need to eliminate"  Notice in the above screenshots, there seems to be no way to change the sizes of those partitions.  When I try to use Boot Camp Assistant now, I get the following error message:  strongThe startup disk cannot be partitioned or restored to a single partition./strong The startup disk must be formatted as a single Mac OS Extended (Journaled) volume or already partitioned by Boot Camp Assistant for installing Windows.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GdLzH.png" alt="Boot Camp Assistant failing because I don&#39;t have a single partition"  Note:  I have attempted (twice) to reboot and use the Disk Utility from the recovery menu, but I get the same results.  <answer139321> I contacted Apple Support and got this solution directly from them.  It's a simple fix, actually.  strongWARNING: ONLY FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS IF YOU HAVE EITHER:/strong  ol liBacked up the precious contents of your drive, or.../li liAfter a strongthoughtful and deliberate/strong count to 10, decided you couldn't care less about the worthless contents of your drive./li /ol  Reboot into Recovery Mode (hold Cmd-R as the machine is restarting).

Now, enter codediskutil cs delete &lt;UUID&gt;/code, pasting (Cmd-V) the number you just copied in place of code&lt;UUID&gt;/code.  Some output will indicate that the volume was deleted.  Close the terminal or switch windows to get back to the Mac OS X Utilities window.  Open Disk Utility and click one of the drives printed in red text.  You should immediately see a message appear, telling you that an error has occurred with your disk (in my case, it also mentions that the disk will not function as a Fusion Drive in its current state).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/761hf.png" alt="Disk Error"  Click the fix button.  All the proper partitioning will be done automagically, and your drive will be restored to its former glory.  All that's left to do is Restore From Time Machine Backup or Reinstall Mac OS X.  The choice is yours.  <answer145282> I know it's a bit late now, but if you can format the blank space as MS-DOS, then Bootcamp Assistant will assume it's a Windows installation, and help you remove it.  <answer151344> I had a similar problem. I created a 30 GB partition and after deleting it there was unused space. I couldn't manually get the original full partition back because of disk errors. So I booted into Recovery (Command + R), repaired the disk with Disk Utility and then the resize to original was no problem. Rebooted and now back to normal. Had no need to reinstall the OS or go into terminal.   <answer161738> There is no need to delete the CoreStorage Logical Volume Group.

The problem, then, is that I don't know the original partition configuration of the fusion drive I need to restore.  I don't want to repartition the wrong way and somehow screw up the fusion drive's performance. <comment297772> There are a lot of potential solutions out there for this problem. This one worked for me after all others had failed! <comment298692> great, thank you this worked for me
