How to package Quicklook plugins for AppStore <body> I developed a bunch of specialized Quicklook plugins and would like to share them through the App store. Is there a way of packaging them and distributing them through the App Store?  <answer228994> Put them inside codeMyApp.app/Contents/Library/QuickLook//code  More info on Apple developer site.     When Quick Look searches for a generator to use, it first looks for it in the bundle of the associated application and then in the standard file-system locations (...)   If You do not have any app and only the plugins, I think you can make a single view application describing the plugins or something like this. However I can't find the reference for this.  <comment279314> That's exactly what I have. It's only the plugins I would like to distribute and I cant find anything about best practices what so ever for that problem.
