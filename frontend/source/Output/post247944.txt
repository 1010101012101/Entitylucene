Associate "chrome-extension://" to Chrome browser? <body> I have installed the Chrome SSH client in my Chrome browser.  How can I make the application association for "chrome-extension://" to the Chrome browser?  I would like to execute this command in Terminal to run application.  precodeopen chrome-extension://pnhechapfaindjhompbnflcldabbghjo/html/nassh.html /code/pre  Here is my current workaround:  precodeSSH_APP=chrome-extension://pnhechapfaindjhompbnflcldabbghjo/html/nassh.html /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome $SSH_APP /code/pre  <answer248134> It's not possible, as the problem is not within Terminal, but rather in Chrome.app's URL scheme. Chrome does not outwardly expose the codechrome:///code and codechrome-extension:///code URL schemes, handling them internally (when you access codechrome://history/code, codechrome://settings/code, etc.).   For example, codeopen chrome:///code does not work in Terminal:     The file /Users/user/chrome: does not exist.   Yet, typing codeopen twitter:///code in Terminal causes the Mac Twitter app to open on my machine.  hr  strongHowever/strong, you can use a bash alias to achieve a similar effect, with an even easier shortcut:  precodealias chrome_ssh="chrome-extension://pnhechapfaindjhompbnflcldabbghjo/html/nassh.html /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome" /code/pre  Add the above to your code~/.bash_profile/code.  <comment306286> Well, you can always hold **command** and double click a link in Terminal, and it should open. When attempting your link (with the double click method), I got a "There is no application set to open the URL chrome-extension://pnhechapfaindjhompbnflcldabbghjo/html/nassh.html" error, which leads me to believe that apps outside of Chrome don't recognize the `chrome-extension` URL scheme. <comment307828> I added a solution similar to yours, (but with a lot less typing) to my original answer below.
