Tab through buttons <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   How can I select buttons with just the keyboard?       How do I tab through buttons?  If I use the tab key it will change the selection (blue background glow) however if I press enter, it will always choose the default option.  See the screenshots for what I mean:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sYRS8.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ehBHR.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer31402> You need to press the kbdspace/kbd bar whilst on the highlighted button (the one with the halo around it). If you press kbdenter/kbd, it will always select the "default" option.  <comment35974> Enter activates default button, space activates selected button.
