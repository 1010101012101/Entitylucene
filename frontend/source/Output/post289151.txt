The Dock was moved to the right side of the screen but still auto displays when cursor on bottom? <body> Using this tip from basic Google Search I was able to move the Dock to the right side:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IGh2u.png" alt="enter image description here"  The Dock emdoes/em show only on the right side now.  However it emalso/em displays (strongauto-unhides/strong) when the mouse/cursor travels to the strongembottom/em/strong of the screen.     It is distracting when interacting with full length windows. Can that behavior be disabled?  I am on Sierra.  <answer289158> If you get unexpected behaviour after manually moving or adjusting the Dock, you can try restarting the Dock.  Open your strongTerminal/strong (emApplications  Other  Terminal/em or search for strongTerminal/strong in strongSpotlight/strong)  Type codekillall Dock/code after the prompt and kbdenter/kbd.  Your Dock should restart with the expected behaviour.  You can verify your settings in the strongSystem Preferences  Dock/strong  strongEdit:/strong It May be necessary to reset the Dock to factory settings then customize as needed. Some have experienced various dock bugs in Sierra.   ol liOpen the Terminal/li liType (or copy and paste) codedefaults delete com.apple.dock; killall Dock/code/li liHit kbdreturn/kbd/li /ol  <comment365261> `killall dock` did not find any processes.  Instead `killall Dock` *did* .. including `Application Switcher`.  I have no idea how to restart those without rebooting. <comment365262> It should restart on it's own after a few seconds.  You'll notice in my answer that it is Dock with a Capital 'D'.  Cheers <comment365263> Also, just for the record, please update your question with the version of macOS you are using. <comment365266> OK I missed that were in caps. The Dock did not restart .. after ten minutes now. <comment365267> That seems to indicate that you have a more serious issue than normal. If a reboot does not fix the issue someone with a bit more process know-how may have further answers. <comment365274> reboot did work. I will award because yours is probably the correct general solution. <comment365281> Iâ€™ll research and update the answer too. I hope you find a solution. Cheers!
