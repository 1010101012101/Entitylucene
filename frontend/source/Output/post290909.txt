Tmux + R + X11 in fullscreen <body> Sorry if this is not the proper community, but didn't manage to find another one for this question.  I have a very strange problem... I'm using an R prompt inside tmux with a fish shell. When i make a plot using an X11/XQuartz device, i can't maximize the window with the plot to fullscreen.  If i do exactly the same from an R prompt anywhere else, it works perfect, so i guess it's a tmux problem.  Any idea of what could it be?
