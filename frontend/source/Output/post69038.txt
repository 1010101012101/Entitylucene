Open in Low Resolution checkbox on Retina MacBook Pro checked and disabled <body> On a Retina MacBook Pro some Java applications (such as IDEA 11.1.3 that is supposed to support it) won't run in HiDPI mode. When I got to "Get Info" on the app, I can see that the "Open in Low Resolution" checkbox is checked and disabled. Is there a way to change this? I have Java 1.6.0_37 installed.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lXZ0P.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer69052> It doesn't sound like the application actually supports HiDPI mode.  Here's a tutorial for modifying Microsoft Word's application package so it will support HiDPI Mode: http://imgur.com/a/0P5KY.  Perhaps it would work for this application as well.  h2Summary of the link:/h2  ul liMake a backup copy of the application/li liOpen the application folder, then right click the app and choose "Show Package Contents"/li liEdit Contents/info.plist/li liToward the bottom of the file, just before code&lt;/dict&gt;/code, add the following lines:  precode&lt;key&gt;NSHighResolutionCapable&lt;/key&gt; &lt;string&gt;True&lt;/string&gt; /code/pre/li liMove the app package out of the applications folder.
