My spinny wheel no longer spins <body> When the mac spinny wheel aka (pinwheel or beachball) appears on my macbook it's not an animation.  It's just static (not spinning).  Any idea what causes this?   I do have some accessibility features enabled like high contrast mode on but i tried disabling them and the issue remained.

What apps are you running when this happens? I assume the skinny wheel eventually stops of its own accord and you can proceed using your Mac.
