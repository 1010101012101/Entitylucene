OSX App Store updates with multiple users <body> My mac has several users. If I want to "update" an app, it says only the original user can do the update. But I don't have access to his account!  How can I either:  ul liUpdate apps from another user/li liDownload my OWN apps instead/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/D4wMc.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kDEd1.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer95849> Applications downloaded from the App Store are available to all local users, there is no way (and also no real reason) to buy and download the same application twice. For updates you must be logged into the Store with the Apple ID used for the initial purchase.  In the situation described in the question the asker can  ul lilog into the Store with the "other" Apple ID to get the download/li liask whoever purchased the application to log into his/her account and get the update/li /ul  <answer153430> Uninstalling the application completely, then going to the App Store and purchasing it again will give you the most up to date version of the application (and will be tied to your Apple ID so future updates will work).  <comment112474> Can you please add a screenshot of the error message you get (see [How do I upload a picture here](http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1744/how-do-i-upload-a-picture-on-here) for details)? <comment112483> done - 2 different ways to make it happen <comment112485> In the first message, is this an Apple ID or a local account you've blacked out? <comment112487> @patrix of an Apple ID which is used by another local account. <comment112489> Both solutions mean involving the "other" user. Not really good design from Apple then... The Mac is shared with a co-worker who is not here. <comment112491> In shared environments it's probably the better approach to have an admin account to install software from, including an admin Apple ID. Or at least have a backup plan at hand in case mission critical software needs to be updated. <comment150641> This is horrible in the case of school owned/issued laptops for faculty. We install the machines and software during imaging process, but faculty (with admin accounts) cannot run software upgrades because it requires our tech account apple id. And there doesn't appear to be any way of changing this without wiping and reimaging the machine? <comment200563> Is this a family-type situation (e.g. dad, friend, roommate bought the app) or professional environment (e.g. school, company)? I'd wager there are different possible solutionsâ€¦ <comment227508> It's unacceptable how Apple handle this situation. App Store is a piece of shit on the Mac since, multiple users completely brokes the system.
