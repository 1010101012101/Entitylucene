Using iFile to change lock screen passcode <body> I would like to know where to go in iFile to be able to see your ipod passcode and be able to change the 4 digit code through iFile. I am running iOS 5.0.1.  <answer123461> It should be, is for sure in iOS6 and will ever strongbe encrypted/strong in future iOS versions. I doubt you can bypass the code.  However there is a securityleak in iOS 5 (since you have 5.0.1) I think you should check out this post online  The post contains this video, on how to bypass the lock. I hope that will help you out rather than changing the code via iFile.  <comment144321> This answer should help: http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/84087/18387 <comment144345> It's in the `/var/Keychains/keychain-2.db` database somewhere. <comment144746> I looked in /var/keychains/keychain -2.db and found nothing. <comment144844> It's not in plaintext. I'm not an expert on the iOS keychain, yet, though. I haven't analyzed it enough, but I've done things like removed saved passwords for websites in Safari and things like that. I don't know how to edit them (they could be hashed). If I have some time, I'll do a little more forensics on it.
