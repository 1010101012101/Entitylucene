Can I script my mac to reboot and login at a specified time? <body> Can I use shell scripts, AppleScript, or some other form of scripting to get my mac to reboot and login at a specified time? If so, how?  <answer156914> You can  ul liuse System Preferences/Energy Settings to define shutdown/restart times/li lirun codesudo shutdown -r 23:45/code to automatically reboot every night/li licombine the second option with a cron/launchd job to reschedule the reboot daily (or just call codeshutdown -r now/code from cron/launchd)/li /ul  You also can set one user to auto-login after reboot in System Preferences/Users &amp; Groups. But at least use a password-protected screen saver in this case, otherwise anybody can walk up to your computer after a reboot and start using it.  <comment184526> Excellent, Patrix! Thanks!
