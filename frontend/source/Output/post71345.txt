Automatically Save Attachments in Mail.app in 10.8 Mountain Lion <body> I am trying to automatically save emall/em email sent to one address (let's call it codetest@example.com/code) to this folder code/Users/luomat/Dropbox/Incoming/e2w//code (where code/Users/luomat = $HOME/code).  Here is the rule that I am using in Mail.app:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/s92xl.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  I have setup a special email address for this purpose, and am fetching it via POP3 from Gmail. The message is being colored Red and marked as read, but the AppleScript does not seem to be working.  I have tried two "Save Mail" AppleScript attachments that I found online, but neither of them work.   (You can find them at  http://share.luo.ma/temp/mail-app-applescript/ if you want to see them.)  I am wondering if perhaps Sandboxing rules in Mail.app 10.8 are preventing this from working, or if I am just doing it wrong. I'm not sure how to troubleshoot AppleScript from Mail.app rules, and I don't really know AppleScript, I've just edited those two scripts I found online to fit what I want to do.  h3Here's what I am trying to accomplish (Ideally):/h3  ol liIf the email is plain text, just save the message to /Users/luomat/Dropbox/Incoming/e2w/ using something like "Subject Line from email address.txt"/li liIf the email has attachments, create a folder in "/Users/luomat/Dropbox/Incoming/e2w/" using the Subject of the email as the folder name, and then save the body of the email as text in that folder as "body.txt" and save the attachments as whatever they were originally called./li /ol  Note: after this AppleScript the /Users/luomat/Dropbox/Incoming/e2w/ will be automatically processed and files will be moved out of that folder using Hazel, so I don't really need to worry about filename collisions.   <answer71384> Try this.  precode   using terms from application "Mail"     on perform mail action with messages theMessages for rule theRule         -- The folder to save the attachments in (must already exist)           -- Save in a sub-folder based on the name of the rule in Mail          set subFolder to name of theRule         tell application "Finder"             set attachmentsFolder to ((path to home folder as text) &amp; "Dropbox:Attachments") as text             if not (exists folder subFolder of folder attachmentsFolder) then                 make new folder at attachmentsFolder with properties {name:subFolder}             end if         end tell         tell application "Mail"              repeat with eachMessage in theMessages                  set {year:y, month:m, day:d, hours:h, minutes:min} to eachMessage's date sent                 set timeStamp to ("" &amp; y &amp; "-" &amp; my pad(m as integer) &amp; "-" &amp; my pad(d) &amp; "-" &amp; my pad(h) &amp; "-" &amp; my pad(min))                  try                     -- Save the attachment                     repeat with theAttachment in eachMessage's mail attachments                          set originalName to name of theAttachment                         set savePath to attachmentsFolder &amp; ":" &amp; subFolder &amp; ":" &amp; timeStamp &amp; " " &amp; originalName                         try                             save theAttachment in file (savePath)                         end try                     end repeat                      display dialog subFolder                 end try             end repeat          end tell     end perform mail action with messages end using terms from  -- Adds leading zeros to date components on pad(n)     return text -2 thru -1 of ("00" &amp; n) end pad /code/pre  I have posted a more general Automatically Save Attachments in Mail.app on my blog   <comment82990> This works to save the attachments. It doesn't save the body of the email, but that's less important to me. Many thanks! <comment88739> Excellent. I seem to get a confirmation dialog every time this filter runs - do you know how it can be disabled? <comment88740> remove or comment out   "display dialog subFolder".
