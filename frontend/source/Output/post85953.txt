I need to restore my data from a non time machine manual backup <body> My machine crashed and I made a manual backup to an external drive...how can i restore all my user data including mailbox data...am I screwed. I did not use time machine backup to back up my data just did a straight copy of the disk drive to a folder on my external drive  <answer85956> You can get your data back.  It might be fairly easy with migration assistant.  There is probably some way of coping the data back &amp; getting your mac to boot.  What OS X are you running?   What you did was drag the Macintosh harddrive Icon on the desktop to the external folder?  You may want to post your question here: https://discussions.apple.com/community/mac_os/mac_os_x_technologies  Or the discussion for your OS X version.  hr  Whatever the case, you will be able to recover your data.  You may have to copy over it folder by folder.  I believe that you can use migration assistant to move everything back. Macintosh-HD - Applications - Utilities - Migration Assistant  In that case, re-install the OS. Then run Migration Assistant  hr  What is the state of your machine?  Is it working?  How did it crash?
