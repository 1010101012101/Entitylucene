Ping respects hosts overrides - but browsers don't, in spite of DNS cache flushes <body> I have a baffling problem. Browsers on my system (10.10.3 Yosemite) don't respect overrides included in my hosts file. This includes Chrome, Safari, and Firefox. I have tried rebooting, clearing history, clearing Chrome's DNS cache with   precodechrome://net-internals/#dns /code/pre  and OSX/Safari's with   precodesudo discoveryutil mdnsflushcache /code/pre  Chrome sometimes respect it for about 5 minutes at a time after clearing its DNS cache, but then miraculously stops again! And this is not reliable.  Ping through the terminal always respects the changes as it should.  I am completely out of ideas. Anyone?  <answer189046> There are similar problems (i.e. https://superuser.com/questions/648133/why-is-chrome-ignoring-etc-hosts-on-os-x) here on the network.  One answer is to follow this bug which must be solved eventually.  People also mention the plugin HostAdmin to workaround this issue.  <comment223974> Thanks for the response... this is definitely an OS-level issue, not just Chrome. HostAdmin seemed very buggy and did not work for me, but another extension called Virtual Hosts is getting the job done OK. https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/virtual-hosts/aiehidpclglccialeifedhajckcpedom <comment223975> If you are familiar with network packet inspectors like Wireshark or `tcpdump` you can use these to see what is going on with DNS queries. <comment223996> @Overbyrd - sure enough, Wireshark shows no DNS lookup activity when I ping a site that's overridden to 127.0.0.1 in the hosts file, but as soon as I load it up in a browser, there is a lookup. Not sure how to proceed from here. <comment224000> Update: While searching Google I found a 2013 post that says to put overrides at the top of the hosts file instead of the bottom. I did this, and suddenly Chrome started obeying. Safari and Firefox did not. But then after about 30 minutes, Chrome just randomly stopped again. Makes NO SENSE. <comment224289> So from a theoretical point of view no application is obliged to respect /etc/hosts. It was the system used before DNS came around, and now on *nix platforms is considered as an override or fallback to DNS.  So I think the modern applications on a modern *nix like Mac OSX might just completely ignore /etc/hosts.  Have you looked into setting up a local DNS resolver that you can point to? If that would be in your control, you would have a win.  Another hint would be thoroughly checking your DNS configuration on _each_ network interface you are using.
