Does upgrading to Mountain Lion means I have to reinstall Android SDK and Eclipse? <body> I'm on Lion and am learning Android development. I have Eclipse Indigo Service Release 1 version and the lastest SDK installed.  If I upgrade to Mountain Lion does it mean I have reinstall the SDK?  I have folders in the root Macintosh HD such as android-sdk-macosx, are these deleted?  <answer57655> No, nothing is deleted when updating. A common sense would be to back-up everything as things emcan/em go wrong, but if everything go right, nothing is deleted! Even opened apps are reopened after update.  It must be noted though that the first time you launch Eclipse, OS X will tell you that it will install Java first, as Java is not installed by default anymore.  <comment66279> I use Time Machine so all my files are backed up right? If something does go wrong I can just restore it? <comment66282> yes, you're pretty much all set. Just go ahead. I updated 2 machine and had absolutely no problem. I'm using both XCode and Eclipse for iOS and Android dev and nothing disappeared when updated!
