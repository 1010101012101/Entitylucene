force quit download from App Store <body> How can I force quit download from App Store? I wanted to download OS X El Capitan for virtual machine usage (I don't have Install El Capitan.app in Applications for some reason), but my download is stuck:  Looks like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wRbxf.png" alt="enter image description here"  I can't reinitiate download, because I am already "downloading". How can I force quit download so that I can start fresh? Maybe the question should be, which activity should I cancel in Activity Monitor?  <answer238294> Go to the strongApp Store/strong and resume any unfinished downloads.  To do that, open the strongApp Store/strong and in the menu go to codeStore --&gt; Check for unfinished downloads/code.  Enter your login credentials.  You can see any downloads that didn't complete.  From there you can restart or delete it.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bBw0f.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment292168> When this happens on my iPhone I just restart and it goes away.  Have you tried restarting your Mac? <comment292169> yes, I already did. <comment292170> Try going to the App Store and check for unfinished downloads.  Do this under `Store -- Check for unfinished downloads`.  You might be able to delete or restart it from there. <comment292173> I restarted it again, but this time I didn't click Resume in Purchased tab of App store, but went on and Download it again from App Store search results. The download started. Not sure why. <comment292181> I'll add that as an answer, and you can accept, for others who might have a similar problem.
