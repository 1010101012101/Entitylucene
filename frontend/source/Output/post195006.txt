Mac OS X Yosemite public beta not receiving updates <body> I have a 2010 iMac and I installed Mac OS 10.10 strongpublic beta/strong last summer, but I haven't received any updates since. My exact version right now is strongOS X 10.10 (14A379b)/strong.  Does anyone know what should i do to get the latest system updates?  <answer195010> in my guess, your beta may be expired, so the solution would be a final yosemite install from app store.  <comment232726> I'd just downed the current OS X Yosemite, now at 10.10.4 (14D2125), from the App Store and install it.
