Removing FileVault2 key from memory on lid close <body> I would like to know, how to remove FileVault2 keys from memory, when I close the lid on my Macbook pro 15" running Yosemite.  It works, when I leave the computer as it slowly goes into standby by itself (first lock-screen then the screensaver and then standby). I had manage to do this, with this classic command:  precodesudo pmset -a destroyfvkeyonstandby 1 /code/pre  But the problem is, that when I close the lid when the screen is just locked, or it isn't locked it, wouldn't destroy the keys. It just locks the screen.  Short version: I want to destroy FileVault2 keys when I close the laptop lid.  <answer170321> In addition to the strongdestroyfvkeyonstandby/strong option, you also need to specify that pmset is setting stronghibernatemode 25/strong for the power management options.   precodesudo pmset -a destroyfvkeyonstandby 1 hibernatemode 25 /code/pre  Setting both options ensures that the Mac in question will hibernate (where the contents of the RAM are written to disk) and also have the FileVault 2 key automatically removed from the saved RAM.   When the laptop is awakened from hibernation, you should see your account icon and a password blank at the FileVault 2 login screen, which would indicate that it had been asleep.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9Fa1I.png" alt="enter image description here"  When this setting is set, you may run into some Power Nap-related issues. I have a post on that available from here:  Power Nap, power management settings and FileVault 2  <comment301200> This is the correct answer 99% of the time. But sometimes I've found it to not work.
