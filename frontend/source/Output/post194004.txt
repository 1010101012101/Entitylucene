Synology NAS - automatic mount in finder and permanent connection <body> I've recently buy Synology DS215j and for almost everything it works fine. But I have two problems with this and Mac OS X.   First I must always first mount this NAS server in finder before using. Sometimes I see it in Shared group in Finder but everytime I tried to click on it and see content it doesn't work and I must first use codeGo -&gt; Connect to a server ... -&gt; and fill smb://192.../code (or use saved address; maybe I have little different names, because I am translating it from my language). Now for sometime it works ok but when I am not using it and try it after hour I must reconnect.  Second problem could be relative to first one. I moved my music folder to NAS and I used application for creating iTunes Server on NAS and when I created I connect it from my MacBook iTunes and it works. But after a while of listening music it stops and it disconnects and I can't find any iTunes Server available.  Is it normal? I just want to always have my music to available and same with files in Finder that are located on NAS. I guess I have set right settings on both side but I am not sure. Thanks for help  <answer194879> Regarding lost iTunes Media Library:  Start iTunes with kbdSHIFT/kbd Key down and select NAS Library as new iTunes Library.  Make sure you still have the files codeiTunes Libary.itl/code and codeiTunes Libary.xml/code after eventualy deleting 'old' Media Folder.  <comment232548> you will find an answer to a similar question [here](http://superuser.com/a/303011/443279)
