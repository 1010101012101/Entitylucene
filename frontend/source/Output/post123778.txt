Different account with different display resolution <body> I am having two accounts on my Macbook Pro with Retina display. My wife doesn't like my current resolution, so she changes to a larger one. However when I switch back to my account, the OS doesn't switch the display resolution, if I change to my preference, it also affects her account.   Is there any way to make it work?  <comment144622> are both accounts admins? <comment144722> No, my wife's account doesn't have admin permission. <comment144723> So she uses a Guest account! <comment144724> I would set her up as admin and see if display preferences get saved then. The Guest account does not do that.
