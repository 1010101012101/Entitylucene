How to get Fake.app to return 2 types of OSX notification? <body> I am trying to automate a 'title' search on Amazon (kindle category) using Fake.app.  The search is conducted every week for about 100 titles. I followed the below 2 posts from Fake.App developer and I am stuck.  strongQuestion 1/strong I have created the workflow and it loops through successfully grabbing the title from my text file.   strongHow do I return a progress message via OSX notification?/strong  I want to return "searching for ${Title}", where Titles is held in a variable  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/myiTt.png" alt="current workflow step, notification shows growl not OSX notifications"  strongQuestion 2/strong  How do I check the search page results to see if it contains ${Title} (e.g. found the book), and return Book found ${Title}?  I am not sure if this is even possible using Fake.App.  I have found a Firefox Browser and Cloud App (Distill.io) that does this (monitors a web page based on text criteria). Distrill.io does have an api ( but I do not know if Fake.App can do this or I have to work out how to call this api to do this step. The result I would like to return via OSX notification if possible.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jPsiI.jpg" alt="current workflow" strongPost 1/strong How to force Fake.app to connect an HTML element by XPath (instead of “id” attribute) How to force Fake.app to connect an HTML element by XPath (instead of &quot;id&quot; attribute)  strongPost 2/strong Fake.app: How to loop thru the rows in a CSV file and use the data in my Workflow?

Add the action to your workflow at the bottom, and chose the "Title Equals" option; then you can but the variable ${Title} into that action.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vlP0e.jpg" alt="Wait for Condition"
