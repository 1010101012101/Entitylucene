Keychain From Different Computer <body> I have Macbook Air and Macbook Pro.  I have some notes in Macbook Pro as saved in keychains.  How can I view them in Macbook Air without affecting Macbook Air keychains?  <answer278974> If you are using iCloud Keychain, you can store the Secure Notes in iCloud, instead of locally on a machine, and the Notes can be visible on any macOS machine logged into the same iCloud account with iCloud Keychain enabled.  <comment351118> Don't know what you mean by 'without affecting Macbook Air keychains'. <comment351179> I think I can import the keychains from other MBP. But it messes Macbook Air keychains too.
