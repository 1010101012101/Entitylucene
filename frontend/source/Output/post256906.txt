Hostname incorrectly shown in Terminal and scutil HostName is not set <body> Today I started the Terminal and the prompt showed:  precodeflos-ipad: mareek$ /code/pre  Now I'm confused because this is not the Hostname of my MacBook Pro. Furthermore my name isn't "Flo" and I don't own an iPad. The Username "mareek" is correct for the user I'm logged in to.  I tried  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"code$ scutil --get HostName HostName: not set $ scutil --get LocalHostName Macbook-Pro-2 $ scutil --get ComputerName Macbook-Pro /code/pre  I wonder why the Hostname isn't set, and where the "flos-ipad" comes from? Any ideas?  Thank you  EDIT: I actually found the solution. Link - Stackexchange /close  <comment320565> Check in your System Preferences - sharing how the computer name is named. Usually the LocalHostName and ComputerName should be the same. ComputerName = Using in your local network, LocalHostName = using by Bonjour Network Services and HostName is irrelevant because need only for static IP Addresses and DNS-Server.
