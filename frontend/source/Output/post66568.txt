nohup or persistent process on Mac OS X ssh <body> I know this has been asked before but none of the answers seems to work in OS X Mountain Lion. I would like to launch a process via SSH and close the terminal without killing the process.  precodenohup ccl64 -e '(ql:quickload :"file")' &amp;  /code/pre  Doesn't work. When the terminal is closed, the process dies.  precodenohup ccl64 -e '(ql:quickload :"file")' /code/pre  Same here.  I think there must be a way. This is very annoying as it works as a standard in any Linux system, yet Mac OS X refuses to work with any of these combinations.  <answer66569> Try codescreen/code instead, it should still be part of the default install. Some people even use screen as their default shell so they don't need to worry about nohup at all.   <answer66570> One thing that always works is codescreen/code. http://ss64.com/osx/screen.html it seems to be available on Mac OS X per default.  Edit: http://macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2004/07/06/unix_gems.html another tutorial abut screen.  Additionally, here is some quick tips on how to use codescreen/code  Open a new 'screen' instance  precode$ screen /code/pre  Once, in the screen, you can 'detach' (or close out of it) the screen like this:  precodectrl+A and then press D /code/pre  To resume a screen, you typically do this:  precode$ screen -x /code/pre  If you have emmore than one/em screen instance, it will tell you their IDs, in which case you can choose which one to strongresume/strong like this:  precode$ screen -r &lt;screen id&gt; /code/pre  <comment78349> could you describe how to run a nohup command with screen? <comment78350> You use screen instead of nohup, and then detach the screen. Your program will continue to work even if the ssh session ends. <comment78351> See `man screen` for details. <comment78352> so over ssh I do screen and then pass the nohup command? with or without the & at the end ? <comment78353> No need for `nohup`. Just do screen ccl64... & . Later, if you need to you can reconnect with screen -R to monitor progress. Alternatively, just run screen and type the command in there , you can detach with Ctrl+A D. <comment78354> thanks it is possible to save the screen output in a file after the launch ? <comment78356> Of course, screen can do everything. You want screen -X `hardcopy`. See https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=47521 for more.
