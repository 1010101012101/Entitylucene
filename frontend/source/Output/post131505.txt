Safari does not load any site but there is Internet connection <body> A friend of mine asked me to help with his MacBook as Safari didn't load any site.  I connected to his computer using TeamViewer (so internet is basically working), and then did a ping on codeGoogle.com/code, which worked. His Mac runs on OSX 10.6.x (strongSnow Leopard/strong) with Safari 5.x.  I've tried a few things including:  ul liPRAM reset/li liDelete cookies and browser cache/li liDNS flush/li liDelete codecookies/cache/plist/code in Library/li liDelete and reinstall emSafari.app/em/li /ul  Non working. I tried downloading Firefox using codecurl/code but that seems also not to work.  Any idea what could be wrong?  edit: No proxys active  <answer131596> What about putting Firefox or Chrome on a USB stick and just copying it via Finder? If they also do not work, I would suspect something more generally wrong, not Safari itself. Might have to use portable version of those apps.  UPDATE: What about any recently installed firewall software?  Anything that might have installed a webfilter or a webfilter appliance that might sit between your Mac and the gateway?  Is NAC enabled on the network, preventing you from getting out until you hit a specific site for authorization?  <answer170894> Is there any app such as Little Snitch that is installed?  If so, it could be blocking browsers but not Team Viewer and not Mail.  <answer191861> Check the DNS server in network preferences for the network adapter you are trying to connect. Usually DNS server ip should be the same as the router ip address.  <answer208700> Open a Finder window. From the Finder menu bar click Go  Go to Folder  Type or copy paste the following  ~/Library/Caches/com.apple.Safari/Cache.db  Click Go then move the Cache.db file to the Trash.  Quit and relaunch Safari to test.  <answer209866> I tried various options including the proxies  The only thing that solved it was System Preferences  Network  Assist me  Connect to the internet And it solved it on its own  <answer277473> I encountered this issue (internet on Safari and App Store app not working), and rebooting my computer ended up resolving the problem for me.   <comment154521> Check his proxy? <comment154548> What exactly do you mean by not loading - what does Safari and Firefox do? <comment154566> @Mark firefox is currently not installed. safari does not load any page, it tries loading but after a few minutes it says unable to connect (does not matter if www.google.com or ip of google.com) <comment154567> @Mathias711 ill check that when i am at home <comment154568> @Zaiborg so the bit re Firefox is just saying curl does not work? <comment154569> curl does not work, and sorftware update (deleted safari, installed from system dvd) says there are no updates available <comment154600> Have you tried using Guest Account? Let's see if it's network misconfiguration, or Safari’s fault. <comment154625> @sayzlim does that apply when you can ping a website but not open it in the browser? <comment154629> @Zaiborg you mentioned that `curl` doesn’t work, but `ping` works. We’ll need to use a clean state Guest Account to see if we should troubleshooting at network level, or application level. <comment154637> @sayzlim guest account does not do the thing. ping on google works, safari still not loading for example google.com <comment154647> installing firefox resulted in the same behaviour ... <comment154706> @Zaiborg don't put the answer as an edit add it as an answer yourself <comment173583> don't safari and firefox both count on a framework of webkit?  could that have gone kablooey somehow?  when it fails how does it fail?  can you see page source from inside the browser, but it just doesn't render? <comment173589> I have had a similar thing with a 10.6 machine. It turned out it  was the mDNSResponder being flaky. But took me a while to figure out because Chrome did work. (seems it uses it's own settings or something) doing a  `sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder` to restart it fixed my issue. Interestingly Apple has a doc that gives a different command for 10.6   `sudo dscacheutil -flushcache` http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5343?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US <comment228007> Check the DNS server in network preferences for the network adapter you are trying to connect.
