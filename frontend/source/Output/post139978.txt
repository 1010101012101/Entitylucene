Getting verify certificate errors after adding Google Account & iCloud keychain problem? <body> I keep getting a verify certificate error whenever I add my Google Account.  The domina is an old company I used to work at and I have removed all account in reference to that account.  However I get the prompt to accept the certificate, I think, after adding my Google account.  Again there is no reference to this account anywhere.  I decided to check the logs and this is what I see. I've masked the actualy values with MY_OLD_COMPANY ETC. Any ideas how I could stop this from happening and remove any reference to this account? Again I don't have it setup ANYWHERE.  precodeJul 25 19:15:18 myComputer icbaccountsd[2520]: -[ICBAccountOperation createAccount]: Got bad password for an inactive account Jul 25 19:15:18 myComputer icbaccountsd[2520]: -[ICBAccountOperation createAccount]: ***IAAccountCreator FAILED for: {         IAAccountTypeKey = kIAServiceIMAP;         IAMailOutgoingAuthenticationType = IAAuthSchemeClearText;         IAMailOutgoingPortKey = 465;         IAMailOutgoingUserNameKey = MY_OLD_COMPANY_USERNAME;         accountDescription = MY_OLD_COMPANY_DESCRIPTION;         authenticationType = IAAuthSchemeClearText;         emailAddress = MY_OLD_COMPANY_EMAIL_ADDRESS;         fullName = MY_NAME;         inactive = 1;         incomingUseSSL = 1;         outgoingMailServer = MY_OLD_COMPANY_MAIL_SERVER;         outgoingUseSSL = 1;         port = 993;         userName = MY_OLD_USERNAME;     } /code/pre  <comment164963> Check your keychain and delete account and certificate. <comment164991> @Buscarì›ƒ That is the peculiar thing about this. I have deleted everything from my keychain and iCloud Keychain and I never see an entry for this.  But yet I don't know where and why this keeps happening.
