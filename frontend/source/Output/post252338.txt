Can I sync changes made on MacOS Photos app with Photos in iOS? <body> I am not using the iCloud Sync feature right now. I manually imported all the pictures on the Photos app on MacOS and made some changes (deleted some, updated some etc.). Is there a way that I can sync the same changes to the Photos app on my iPhone?  Please let me know if you need more information.  <comment313954> Sync automatically or sync manually? Also is there a specific reason why you don't use iCloud? <comment314043> I have 25 GB of photos and around 20GB of other documents already stored on Dropbox and I'm already paying for it. I recently bought iPhone, so I am new to this. I am fine with the option to sync manually, if there's not automatic sync option available.
