OS X Terminal: 'ls' shows program but then says command not found? <body> I am trying to start MongoDB from the terminal. When I navigate to the folder and hit 'ls', all the applications show up but when I type in the name of the application( 'mongod'), it says it is not found!  precodeAbes-MacBook-Air:bin abe$ ls  bsondump    mongodump   mongoimport mongorestore    mongostat mongo       mongoexport mongooplog  mongos      mongotop mongod      mongofiles  mongoperf   mongosniff  Abes-MacBook-Air:bin abe$ mongod  -bash: mongod: command not found /code/pre  What is going on?  <answer221049> The executable is in your current working directory. Therefore you need to add code.//code to your command. So try code./mongod/code.  See this UNIX StackExchange question for details and background: Why do we use “./” to execute a file?
