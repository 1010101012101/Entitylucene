How can I restore my iPod touch using a different computer? <body> I've had my 5supth/sup-gen iPod for a while now, and my computer broke a while back, lost iTunes and everything. Also I can't remember my Apple ID. There was never any need to connect it after I first did to put my music on.  However, I am locked out since typed my password in too many times incorrectly. I have access to my friends computer to restore it, but how do I do this?  <answer112159> To restore your deviceâ€¦  ol liPut your device into Recovery mode  ol liTurn the device off/li liHolding the home button, connect it to your computer./li /ol/li liiTunes should prompt to restore the device./li liFollow the instructions./li /ol  If you have Find my iPhone enabled, you will need to log in to iCloud and remove the device from your account before you can restore it.
