How to set timeout to 'ping' command? <body> In windows argument code-w/code and number in milliseconds set how long wait echo reply from pinging host.  I'm running now macOS Sierra and code-t/code argument from ping help set count of echo requests. So codeping google.com -c 5/code and codeping google.com -t 5/code give the same result - five echo requests with default timeout.   Is there a flag that does what I need?  <answer284360> Looking at the man page for ping (codeman ping/code); under the code-i wait/code option, we see that the default time between sending pings is 1 second:     -i wait      wait seconds between sending each packet.  The default is to wait for one second between each packet.   So, using the default of sending 1 packet every 1 second, the options code-t/code and code-c/code will produce the same output.  When we add in a emfractional/em wait time of say, a half second, we should now get 12 packets sent within the 6 seconds:  precode$ sudo ping -i .5  -t 6 apple.stackexchange.com  PING apple.stackexchange.com (151.101.193.69): 56 data bytes 64 bytes from 151.101.193.69: icmp_seq=0 ttl=58 time=12.509 ms 64 bytes from 151.101.193.69: icmp_seq=1 ttl=58 time=11.990 ms 64 bytes from 151.101.193.69: icmp_seq=2 ttl=58 time=17.027 ms 64 bytes from 151.101.193.69: icmp_seq=3 ttl=58 time=13.173 ms 64 bytes from 151.101.193.69: icmp_seq=4 ttl=58 time=15.752 ms 64 bytes from 151.101.193.69: icmp_seq=5 ttl=58 time=10.337 ms 64 bytes from 151.101.193.69: icmp_seq=6 ttl=58 time=15.484 ms 64 bytes from 151.101.193.69: icmp_seq=7 ttl=58 time=9.653 ms 64 bytes from 151.101.193.69: icmp_seq=8 ttl=58 time=9.734 ms 64 bytes from 151.101.193.69: icmp_seq=9 ttl=58 time=9.486 ms 64 bytes from 151.101.193.69: icmp_seq=10 ttl=58 time=11.321 ms 64 bytes from 151.101.193.69: icmp_seq=11 ttl=58 time=9.549 ms /code/pre  Twelve responses as expected.  Note, that you must run this as coderoot/code;    per the man page for the code-i wait/code option:     The wait time may be fractional, but only the super-user may specify   values less than 1 second.   Now, the code-W/code option (capital "W", not lowercase) will be the equivalent to the Windows code-w/code which specifies a wait time between receipt of the packets:     -W waittime Time in milliseconds to wait for a emreply/em for each packet sent. If a reply arrives later, the packet is not printed as replied,   but considered as replied when calculating statistics.
