I want to create and automator that opens a specific file <body> I want to open a specific file - if I press F5 or another key - its a file I use all the time, so want it to be open at a touch of a key  <answer86027> Create a service like this and give it a shortcut in System Preferences  Keyboard  Keyboard Shortcuts  Services:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cMNVf.jpg" alt=""  There's a bug in 10.7 and 10.8 where the shortcuts for services don't always work until you hover over the services menu from the menu bar. There is also a short delay before services are run, and the shortcuts don't work when the frontmost application doesn't have a services menu.

Otherwise move the file in to the dock, so it is always there and opens with a click. <comment99199> Hi Lauri. Does the free version have that functionality or only the powerpack? <comment99217> @adayzdone It's only in the Powerpack, but some free alternatives are [Quicksilver](http://qsapp.com) and [Launch it!](http://www.launchitapp.com). <comment99224> I have been looking to try that out ... thanks.
