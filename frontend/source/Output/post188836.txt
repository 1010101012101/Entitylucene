Macbook Pro Freezes when waking from sleep/hibernation <body> When I open my MacBook Pro after it has been closed (usually for more than 1 hr) I get a slow response.  One of the following happens:  ol liI hear a mechanical startup sound, and grey screen appears.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/49PaT.jpg" alt=""  Then once that loads I get my login screen, but it's frozen. Mouse won't move and can't type. If I don't touch anything then the screen will turn off after 1 minute. Then if I do anything, touch the trackpad, or the keyboard, it will open like it should. Instantly to the login screen and I can type my password no problem.  This takes about 2–3 minutes to get up and running./li liThe screen is opened and the computer goes straight to the frozen login screen./li liScreen does not respond. Stays black. I have to hold down the power button to do a hard restart./li liThis happened for the first time yesterday. The grey screen shifted to a darker grey and took me to a welcome page where I could choose the language and then it had options for a forgotten password etc./li /ol  MacBook Pro 13″, Mid 2012  <answer188841> What you describe indicates a failing disk. Here are 3 methods to fix that.  If you can start in Safe Mode then use Disk Utility to try to repair it.  Alternatively use the kbdcmd/kbd+kbdr/kbd to boot in to the recovery mode and use the Disk Utility  If that did not work start in Single user mode and run codefsck -fs/code to try to repair it.  See this Apple KB article here: https://support.apple.com/kb/HT203176  <comment223603> Those are indication of a failing disk.
