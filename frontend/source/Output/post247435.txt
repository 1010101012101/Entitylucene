How to check the progress of files moved from one place to another in terminal? <body> I am new to terminal. I started moving 30 gigs of data, from my desktop to my portable harddisk with the command codemv location1 location2/code.  The problem is, I cannot see, how much data has been transferred.   How to see the progress in a bar format or in percentage format?  <answer247438> The standard codemv/code command doesn't offer an option to show progress. What you can do instead is  ul liopen a new Terminal tab with kbdCmd-T/kbd/li licheck the size of the target file by running codels -l location2/code/li /ul  <answer247442> I found this https://github.com/atdt/advcpmv it adds the -g option to cp and mv which will display a progress bar.  Here's how I got it to work on El Captain:  Requirements:  ul liXcode/li liwget (you can install wget with brew or MacPorts)  /li /ul  Then:  precodewget http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.21.tar.xz tar xvJf coreutils-8.21.tar.xz cd coreutils-8.21/ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/atdt/advcpmv/master/advcpmv-0.5-8.21.patch patch -p1 -i advcpmv-0.5-8.21.patch ./configure make /code/pre  At this point you will have emcp/em and emmv/em binaries in src/ give them a try and if you don't have problem with them you can move them to code/usr/local/bin/code.  You may also rename the two binaries to emcpgres/em and emmvgres/em (or other unique names) so that you can use the standard cp/mv commands also.  <answer247450> strongrsync/strong can do that for you, with a nice progress meter that (as the man page says) "gives a bored user something to watch".  precodersync --progress --remove-source-files {source file} {destination} /code/pre  There's a lot else that rsync can do, such as mirroring directories, recursing large trees, throttling bandwidth usage, and much more. strongman rsync/strong is your friend.  Oh, and since you're moving a directory tree, be sure to include the strong--recursive/strong option.  <comment305372> @klanomath You are wrong, I just tried and it works fine. Thanks for downvoting without trying. So I will the answer with the steps. <comment305376> it does not give a progress meter for the whole set of files.it shows for each specific file. which is just occupying terminal space, no actual knowledge is achieved from it. <comment305386> I downvoted the answer because it was almost a link-only answer. But I also upvote answer after they got improved ;-)!
