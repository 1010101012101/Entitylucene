Issue in ipv6 set up in mac <body> I had ipv4 enable LAN connected to my MAC OSX 10.11.5 via ethernet. I tries to enable NAT64 and ipv6 in my mac from the steps mention in the link :  https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/NetworkingInternetWeb/Conceptual/NetworkingOverview/UnderstandingandPreparingfortheIPv6Transition/UnderstandingandPreparingfortheIPv6Transition.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010220-CH213-SW1  Steps are : 1)System preference 2)Click Sharing 3)Move to internet Sharing 4)Click option button, It will enable or unhide the "Create NAT64" check box 5)Enable or select the check box "Create NAT 64" 6)Click Wifi option. Create the Wifi 7)Select or switch on the internet sharing.  But when i try to connect it with my device(iphone 6 ,iphone 6s and with iOS9.3.2 version) Device is able to detect the name of wifi and able to connect it. But when i try to open some url in safari or in any other application i am not getting any connection.  Please help and advice me how to resolve it  <comment317167> Can you make an IPv6-only connection from your Mac itself, or are you relying on the Mac for 6to4? Do you have a dedicated DNS64 server? <comment317168> @Tetsujin My Mac is having IPV4 only connection. And i enable NAT64 in mac "Internet sharing" panel. I dont have any dedicated DNS64. But i guess 10.11. onwards if we enable this "Create NAT64 network". We dont need to have dedicated DNS and NAT. Please advice and give some details. If you are aware of that <comment317169> @Tetsujin Thank you for the reply <comment317172> I don't understand it fully, but from that page it looks like you must have DNS64 somewhere, or there is going to be no address resolution <comment317174> @Tetsujin Mac is connected to IPV4 ethernet.. There is no DNS server. I just perform the steps over here : https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/NetworkingInternetWeb/Conceptual/NetworkingOverview/UnderstandingandPreparingfortheIPv6Transition/UnderstandingandPreparingfortheIPv6Transition.html  and then try to connect my device with the hotspot wifi.
