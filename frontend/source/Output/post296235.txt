How do I turn off cellular data on certain apps with an iPhone 6 <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eQ7Fvl.png" alt="enter image description here"  Many of my apps I barely use but still need use up some of my cellular data. I would like to turn the data of for certain apps, but as you can see in the picture it looks ,in a way, tinted. It won't let me turn off the data on the apps or turn it on for apps.   I don't know if I'm supposed to click a certain thing somewhere else in the settings.   Please Help!!  <answer296236> Check if restrictions is turned on in settings - general - restrictions. Turn it off and try again.  <comment374194> & make sure to switch on Find iPhone - that's the one you really need to work at any time, should you ever lose the phone.
