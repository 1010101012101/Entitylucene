How would one go about getting Apple to adjust the standard kerning table for a small obscure part of unicode <body> Playing around on facebook recently, I typed some old norse runes, and noticed that the kerning is positively atrocious. Not too surprising, since this is very much an edge case. Nonetheless, I would really want to have this fixed, and was wondering what it might take to actually succeed. I'm sure I could get the actual kerning table crowdsourced, but how would I go about getting Apple to incorporate it into the standard fonts?  Here's an example of my name: codeᛉᛅᚱᚴᚢᛋ/code, as you can see, there is emway/em too much space between the codeᛉ/code (m) and the codeᛅ/code (a).  <answer196019> You could try the Apple Bug Reporter - it's really the only way to get their attention.  <comment234073> Of course non-mac users viewing your text will be using different fonts.  Nothing Apple does will affect them. <comment234444> Obviously, but *I* will see see the difference :-)
