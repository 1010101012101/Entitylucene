What are all the OS X special user folders? <body> I know OS X has a code~/Sites/code folder with its own icon for keeping your websites, and it isn't there by default, you have to create it.  Are there more folders similar to this one that receive special icons after creation?  <answer115193> h1subsubsubimg src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AF1BI.jpg" width="40"/sub/sub/sub ~/Applications/h1  For storing apps that you want to be private to your account, and does have a 'special icon' (the icon of /Applications) upon creation.  h1subsubsubimg src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wYlrj.jpg" width="40"/sub/sub/sub ~/Sites/h1  For storing your websites. Accessible on the network as /~username.  h1subsubsubimg src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ppbWt.jpg" width="40"/sub/sub/sub ~/Library/h1  If you're not already aware, there's a ~/Library which is hidden, but does have a 'special icon' if you unhide it using codechflags nohidden ~/Library/code or enable Show Library Folder in View Options.  <comment134858> The `~/Sites` folder was removed in Mountain Lion, but nothing saying you can't add it back yourself.
