Automount encrypted external drives <body> I have two external encrypted disks, one for data, one for backup.  They are in keychain, when I plug them in they automount, but for the most of the time, they do not.  I use:  precodediskutil corestorage unlockVolume XXXXX -stdinpassphrase /code/pre  in terminal to unlock and mount them.  It just bothers me to start every morning with disk unlocking. Is there any way to "fix" this?
