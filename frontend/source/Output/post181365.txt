Ability to share .pdf using email not working in Preview <body> Preview has the ability to "share" documents by mailing them. When I select this feature, nothing happens. I don't get an error  message.   Is there a fix for this?  I've already tried removing com.apple.Preview from containers and group containers, but this did not work.   I'm running OS-X 10.10.2 on a late 2013 MBPr.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YedyG.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer181367> Your icon on Mail would seem to appear that Google Chrome is set to be your mail client.  It works fine if Apple Mail is set as default mailer.   I can't even persuade Chrome to be accepted as a mailer from RCDefaultApp. I'd certainly be tempted to try switching the default to something else.
