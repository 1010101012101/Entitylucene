Why does it say I'm using more data than I am on my IPad? <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7ZX5S.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  It says that I have used 12.1 GB of data, but when added all up, it's no where near 12.1 GB. Maybe 10 GB at most, and I recently deleted a BUNCH of videos to clear up space, but it did nothing!  <answer246044> I think it may be that it may be that your looking at the strongiCloud storage/strong not the iPad storage (you probably haven't uploaded very much).
