How to set permissions on network interfaces? <body> At each reboot, the permissions on the network devices code/dev/bpf*/code are changed.  As a developer, I want write acccess on these files.  This can easily be fixed with a codechmod/code.  What is the most elegant solution to fix this issue permanently?  <answer21345> Wireshark ships a codeStartupItem/code that does just that; however, the StartupItems API is deprecated:  precode The SystemStarter utility is deprecated.  System services should instead  be described by a launchd.plist(5).  See launchd(8) for more details.  The launchd utility is available on Mac OS X 10.4 and later.   In earlier versions of Mac OS X, the SystemStarter utility is used to  start, stop, and restart the system services which are described in the  /Library/StartupItems/ and /System/Library/StartupItems/ paths. /code/pre  So, since you're asking for "the most elegant solution", that would be a launch daemon.  I haven't tried the following code, but it should be roughly correct.  Create a file code/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.stackexchange.apple.bpf-helper.plist/code:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;com.stackexchange.apple.bpf-helper&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;array&gt;         &lt;string&gt;/Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/com.stackexchange.apple.bpf-helper.sh&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;/array&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  And a file code/Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/com.stackexchange.apple.bpf-helper.sh/code:  precode#!/bin/sh chgrp admin /dev/bpf* chmod g+rw /dev/bpf* /code/pre  Both should be owned by coderoot:wheel/code. The first should be 644; the second 755 (600 and 700, respectively, will probably do as well).  You can use codelaunchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.stackexchange.apple.bpf-helper.plist/code to try it without a reboot.  <comment23536> [\[launchd-dev\] About the ServiceIPC key](http://lists.macosforge.org/pipermail/launchd-dev/2009-June/000570.html): `On Leopard and later, you can treat the ServiceIPC key as   being inferred through the presence of a Sockets or MachServices   dictionary. There's no need to explicitly specify it.` <comment23554> Hadn't actually meant to leave that in there, since it should be irrelevant, but thanks. :)
