Why don't I always see "Internal Speakers" as an option in the "Play sound effects through" list? <body> In the "Sound" section of System Preferences (specifically the "Sound Effects" tab), there's an option to choose what output the sound effects are played through.  When nothing is plugged into the headphone jack, "Internal Speakers" is an option.  However, if the headphone jack is being used, that option changes to "Headphones."  When I'm using the headphone jack to, for example, play music through speakers, I don't want sound effects playing through those speakers and interrupting my music.  Why is that the case?  Why can't I always choose "Internal Speakers"?  And is there any way to make "Internal Speakers" always appear as an option?
