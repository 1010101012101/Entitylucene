Can I format new MacBook hard drive from OSX DVD? <body> I have to install a fresh new drive into my MacBook pro 2009.  I haven't formatted yet, nor do I have a USB dock to do so from my current osx installation.  If I install the new drive and boot from the osx DVD that came with my Mac, will be able to do what's necessary to get every running ok?  <answer51522> Yes, you have full access to the Disk Utility program from within the installer process, so you can partition and format to your hearts content.  <comment58903> +1 Sweeeeeeeeeeeeet, just waiting 13 mins to mark as answer
