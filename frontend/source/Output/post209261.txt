Steps to send a file with FTP? <body> I can connect to my server in my terminal with codeftp/codecommand. Then, I connect to my site with codeopen xxx/code but I don't know how to send file from my computer (local) to this server, with codeput/code.  Can someone explain it to me ?   <answer209264> If you type codeput/code and add a space after that command, you can then drag a file into the terminal window, it will paste the full path to the filename and add the extension from the filesystem.  Press enter and the transfer from the Mac to the server should start...  <answer209270> FTP is one of the oldest file transfer commands, quite as old as the codetelnet/code command. Here is a short usage, although I encourage you to use scp or sftp instead of, because basic ftp transmits username and password in cleartext through the wire, except using the ftp-s protocol, which opens a SSL based connection (that requires a client capable of doing this).  To open a ftp connection to a destination server from the terminal:  code$ ftp &lt;server&gt;/code  After logging in with username and password, list directory with codels/code and codecd/codeinto the required directory.  Depending on the server configuration, you can get or put files:  codeget &lt;filename&gt;/code  codeput &lt;filename&gt;/code  If it is a binary file like an archive, switch on binary transfer mode first by issueing the codebin/code command first.  Close the connection by sending codequit/code.  There is always the codehelp/code command to see all allowed and available commands:  codeftp&gt; help/code  Hope that helps.   <comment252463> Thanks for the advice with SFTP, will check that :) Else, @bmike answer resolved the problem. <comment252464> Thanks a lot for this answer, works perfectly !
