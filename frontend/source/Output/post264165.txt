How to force MacOS to regenerate /etc/resolv.conf file? <body> Apple states clearly that the code/etc/resolv.conf/code file is managed by Mac OS so it will be regenerated. The problem is that it seems that when I join the OpenVPN this does not happen and as a result tools like codenslookup/code fail to see the vpn.  precode# # Mac OS X Notice # # This file is not used by the host name and address resolution # or the DNS query routing mechanisms used by most processes on # this Mac OS X system. # # This file is automatically generated. # domain local nameserver 192.168.1.1 /code/pre  I need to know which command can I run in order to force MacOS (Sierra) to regenerate the file.  As you can see my file does not contain the correct list of DNS servers. For example the codescutil --dns/code returns a long list of DNS servers, one that includes the OpenVPN dns servers.  <answer277801> I found a solution today. Actually the file is not code/etc/resolv.conf/code in mac OS. It is code/var/run/resolv.conf/code  So do this:  precodesudo rm /etc/resolv.conf sudo ln -s /var/run/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf /code/pre
