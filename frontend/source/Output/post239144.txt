Zoom with scroll in Chrome browser <body> I am new user of OS X, I am missing one important feature is zooming page with trackpad or mouse scroll.    I need to get the same result as shortcuts kbdCommand/kbd + kbd-/kbd and  kbdCommand/kbd + kbd+/kbd do.  I mean that the page should change it size, I need this for responsive web design.   Is there any way to make this work for example using kbdCommand/kbd + kbdScroll/kbd?  <comment293400> Is there a reason why you can't use Command +/- ? <comment293464> Yes, I use to use scroll, I need to move my fingers from one part of keyboard to another, I feel really uncomfortable ... I need to change the size of the screen very often, this really a little bit annoying.
