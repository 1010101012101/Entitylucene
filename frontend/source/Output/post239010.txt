"RNDIS/Ethernet Gadget" Share Internet <body> I've connected my Pi Zero over USB to my OS X laptop and under codePreferences -&gt; Network/code it shows up as codeRNDIS/Ethernet Gadget/code, with a codeself assigned IP/code.  It says that codeRNDIS/Ethernet Gadget has a self-assigned IP address and will not be able to connect to the Internet./code  I'd like it to be able to connect to the internet.  How does one enable this?  <comment293210> I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because the device which needs configuring is not an Apple device nor is it running Apple software. Additionally, there is no evidence given by the OP of what troubleshooting steps have been taken. <comment293214> @IconDaemon, I've enabled internet sharing for the network device if that helps <comment293221> You need to be able to set the IP address on the Pi Zero to be in the IP address range of the laptop. <comment293223> @IconDaemon how could one set the IP of the Pi? `netstat -nr` only returns the local one (169.xxx.xxx.xxx). Also, should this be moved to the R-Pi SE site? <comment293232> I don't have any experience with the R-Pi. I suggest you move this discussion to the R-Pi site. You may get a more concise answer!
