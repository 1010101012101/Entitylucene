How do I prevent App Store showing badge on its icon on OS X 10.9 Mavericks? <body> On both Dock and Launchpad.  I opened App Store by mistake, and now I cannot remove the badge which is designed for reminding me updates, except I install all the updates or delete all the apps which have updates.  <answer157773> You cannot. Notifications (which include icon badges) are not configurable for the Mac App Store app.  <comment185668> However, this feature should rely on some APIs, meaning that would be possible if I destroy the API dependency tree or modify some configuration profile (plist or Core Data or what else)... Would you make some research on that, please? I'll appreciate...
