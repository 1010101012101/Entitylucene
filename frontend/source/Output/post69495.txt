What window is playing audio? <body> I've got a number of windows open, including several browser windows.  One of them is playing an annoying advertising video.  How can I easily locate which window is playing audio?  <answer70393> You could use chrome developer tools to inspect the page you are viewing. Click on the resources tab to inspect what resources are used.  <answer75922> 1.) Close one window after the other and locate the sound. Then reload using the history tab. 2.) Install AdBlock and you don't need to care about it anymore!  <answer88263> Ability to see per-application sound output: Check out https://superuser.com/questions/150304/per-application-volume-settings-possible-on-mac-os-x-snow-leopard  Within Chrome, you can use the Mutetab extension to see what tabs/windows are playing audio.  <comment88099> I think 1.) is not what the OP meant by easily ;) <comment103288> Everybody can edit answers anyway, there is no need to turn it into a community wiki for that. <comment103299> Good to know, thanks :)
