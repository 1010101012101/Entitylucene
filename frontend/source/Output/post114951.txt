Transferring Clash of Clans <body> I originally started playing Clash of Clans on a first-generation iPad and connected it to my GameCenter. I then got a third generation iPad, linked it to the first iPad's GameCenter account, and continued playing Clash of Clans on the new iPad 3. My friend is giving me his GameCenter account, which is linked to HIS Clash of Clans village- is there any way I can transfer his village to my Game Center ?  <answer115174> If I understand your question correctly you can:  ul lisign into your our Game Center on your iPad 3/li lidelete the app from the original iPad (making a backup first)/li lisign into your friend's Game Center on your iPad /li lireload the game and verify the correct village loaded/li /ul  Once that is done, you should have both villages intact.  <answer115257> You will only lose that village from the device, on your iPad 3 everything will be fine.  Jush log out in the game and from gamecenter and then let him log in.  <answer126507> I'd suggest makeing a complete back up of your first-gen iPad via iTunes and then restoring it to your iPad 3. This should conserve the game saves and iOS app data.
