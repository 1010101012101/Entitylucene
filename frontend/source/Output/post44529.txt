Shift+End Combo on OS X Lion <body> How can I change the settings for OS X Lion so that the combination of Shift+End results in the selection of text from the current cursor position to the end of the current line?  Specifically, I would like to be able to do this in Firefox, but if there is a general method that works for most/all applications, that would be ideal.  <answer44550> There is a default key binding to perform this function: kbdshift/kbd + kbd ⌃ (control)/kbd + kbd→/kbd.

I'm still transitioning from Windows.  That said, I am interested in the keybindings info as well, so thanks for that. <comment50646> I think you made the right call. Remapping the bindings gets into areas that make me uncomfortable—and drive you crazy when you're used to a custom set up but have to use someone's *stock* computer. <comment50661> You may be interested in Nathan Greenstein's screencast that goes through how to be an OS X ninja with keyboard shortcuts and text: http://apple.blogoverflow.com/2012/03/keyboard-ninja-working-with-text-screencast/
