After installing OSX 10.12.4 cannot log into iCloud, "An unknown error has occurred" <body> I ran the update last night and during the startup process after the update it asks you to log back into iCloud. However, when I do so, I get a message in red letters in the iCloud login box:  precodeAn unknown error has occurred. /code/pre  Just for fun, I deliberately put in the wrong password and that returns a different message about the password being wrong. I've signed out and in on both my iPhone and the web site with no problems. Any ideas?
