Server dropped connection unexpectedly with certain WiFi <body>    OS: Yosemite      Type: Macbook Air 11   I have 2 WiFi's (A and B). Whenever I connect to A, my Mac drops the connection to a certain websites and often loses connection to the WiFi. But when I connect to B, everything's fine. No disconnection and no "server dropped connection unexpectedly".   This situation does not happen when I connect to the same websites with Windows.  Why is this happening and what can I do to solve the problems when connecting to A?  I tried restarting WiFi but it does not solve the problem.  <comment196331> Probably need to state what routers or APs are providing the signal for each.  I suspect one either connects at 5ghz and the other only 2.4, or it could be some other difference in the signal provided.  Wifi is not just wifi...there are MANY variants. <comment196493> I'm getting some information. <comment196740> How do I get those? I tried finding it but, well, I can't see what info I should get. (Noob at these stuffs)
