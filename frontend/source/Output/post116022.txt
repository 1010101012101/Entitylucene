Cannot edit /etc/fstab to let NTFS drives write <body> I have Mac Os X 10.9 Mavericks. I want to write to NTFS drives. I followed the instructions here.  The following command was not allowed to run:  precode$ sudo echo "UUID=7575C85E-F6F7-4ABD-B7FB-6180B795DD81 none ntfs rw,auto,nobrowse" &gt;&gt; /etc/fstab -bash: /etc/fstab: Permission denied /code/pre  What should I do to edit /etc/fstab?  <answer116023> You need sudo to perform the write to code/etc/fstab/code and not the echo. Try:  precodeecho "xyz" | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab &gt; /dev/null /code/pre  I added the code&gt; /dev/null/code to suppress the echoing of the long UUID (which I abbreviated "xyz" for clarity's sake). You can skip the code&gt; /dev/null/code part and it will function the same as the command you listed.  precodeecho "UUID=7575C85E-F6F7-4ABD-B7FB-6180B795DD81 none ntfs rw,auto,nobrowse" | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab /code/pre  <answer116024> You could use an editor under sudo  e.g. for nano  precodesudo nano /etc/fstab /code/pre  Then copy the line from somewhere to the clipboard and then use paste to paste into the edit session. Then save.  <answer116036> Ummm, last time I heard writing to NTFS volumes is not fully supported by Apple as evidenced by it not being enabled out of the box. So proceed with caution.  A quick google search will yield several third party drivers (free and paid) that enable writing to NTFS drives.  http://www.paragon-software.com/home/ntfs-mac/  That's the number one hit in google, there are a lot more. But if you want to live dangerously then go for it! ;-)  <answer187897> In OSX 10.9 the file code/etc/fstab/code does not exist, so I just create that file and works perfectly.  Just don't be confused (like me) with a file called code/etc/fstab.hd/code.  <comment135779> I might reject your emacs and substitute `vi` but perhaps we can all agree to mock Apple that typically nano for editing system files? http://manuals.info.apple.com/MANUALS/1000/MA1173/en_US/IntroCommandLine_v10.6.pdf <comment135782> I suppose the attempted joke at "editor choice religious wars" would be better placed somewhere else... Fos someone not comfortable with command line - nano is the perfect choice IMO.
