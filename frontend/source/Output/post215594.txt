"is not registered with iMessage" iPad mini to iPhone 4 <body> So I recently asked a girl to text me, and I put my email on her phone, but she never texted me because it said "not registered with iMessage" even though I am. Then, I asked her for her phone number and when I tried to text it, it said "is not registered with iMessage". We both have iMessage and we both made sure we gave each other the proper address. I have an iPad mini 1 and I think she has an iPhone 4 or something. Can anyone help me with this???  <answer215635> Make sure you have that email address selected in the list in Settings  Messages  iMessage  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uzAsY.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment260430> Are you updated to the latest iOS? <comment260433> I have iOS 9, but not iOS 9.1 yet... Do you think that will help? <comment260444> maybe. If not, try turning iMessage of and then on in Settings. <comment260452> Ok I'll try that and tell you what happened... Thanks :) <comment260455> Nope... As much as I hate to say it, it still says she's not registered with imessage <comment260623> Tetsujin thanks for answering me! I have the iPad and she has the iPhone and the email I gave her is in that so, if you have any other suggestions it is much appreciated :) Thanks <comment260695> You both checked this on your phone/pad, that the address you each are using is registered in your own phone/pad?
