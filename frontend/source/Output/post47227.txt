Image with safari will mount automatically when download is complete otherwise you should click on it to get it mounted./li libackup existing Safari (the one that you want to replace)/li liremove existing Safari using Terminal:  codesudo rm -rf /Applications/Safari.app//code/li lijust install it as usual application/li /ul  <answer47878> I tried that but it wouldn't install.  I had this problem in Mac OS X 10.6.8 Snow Leopard. I downloaded the latest version from Apple, but the installer said that I had a newer version already installed.  I had to use the application called Pacifist.  It installs applications when the installer won't.  It worked great.  <comment54985> That's exactly what I just did with the only intention to help guy in this question:  http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/47217/14692?stw=1
