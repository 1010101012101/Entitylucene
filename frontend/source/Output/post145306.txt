Save As in MS Office for Mac to a different location <body> I have Office for Mac 2011 which seems to work OK. However if I open a file from one location and wish to do Save As.. to another location, all I get is the basic list of where I can save, but seemingly no opportunity to drill down into sub-folders etc. For instance in the screen shot the location Kingston is an external usb drive with multiple folders and sub folders, but if I click on that, it puts that into the Where box and the document is saved in the root of that. Any ideas please, Gurus?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aixQt.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer145310> If you click on the little triangle to the right of the Save As box it will open more detailed window to choose where to save it. OS X has both a simple and expanded Save dialog and applications can choose to show one or the other as the default Save dialog. Looks like MS Office defaults to the simplified view.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4GO30.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer145341> Click on the down arrow button next to the file name you specify. You should get a window to select the location where you want to save the file.
