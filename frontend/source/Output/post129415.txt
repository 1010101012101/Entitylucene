How to add the current slide number plus the total slides in Keynote? <body> I am wondering how I could achieve something like that in the current version of Keynote for OSX:    For example the current slide is 3 and the total slides are 10.br And I want to show it like strong(3 / 10)/strong and so on.  I could do it manually, but is there some automation for it?  <answer179279> Keynote has no such feature (counting the total number of slides).  Semi-manual solution: Add the total number of slides as a text-box " /10"in your Master configuration. Place it next to the automatic slide number that Keynote generates.  <answer248118> X of Y may not work. But solely X page could. I've just configure this feature on keynote follow the answer below, it did worked.
