If I buy an SSL Certificate, is this trusted in Apple without installing cert file in iOS? <body> I created an app for iOS for a company and I want to distribute this app ad hoc over the air.  In iOS 7 and greater, I need an https site to install this app.  I created my own certificate locally and I must install my cert file via email or a direct link on iPhone to Trust this certificate and then I can install my app.  I want to know: if I buy an SSL certificate from legal seller like codegodaddy/code or codegeocerts/code and set it to my own website, do I need install a cert file on the iPhone or not?  My company's site is offline and not connected to internet.  <answer167190> Purchasing an SSL certificate will not require any further configuration on the device, regardless of whether this is from a 'standard' Certificate Authority.  If the certificate is purchased from a standard Certificate Authority, this provides the additional benefit of verifying the company being represented by the domain, but this is tangental to the actual HTTPS requirement by Ad-Hoc distribution.
