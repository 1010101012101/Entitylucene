How to take out HDD (hard drive) from a G5 <body> G5 is totally defunct, I trying to take out the HDD for archive purpose.br But realize ... there is no way for me to take out the casing.br Any idea?  <answer89548> Here is the G5 manual (late 2005): https://web.archive.org/web/20130514170019/http://manuals.info.apple.com/en/Power_Mac_G5_Late_2005.pdf  On page 45 it is explained how to open the casing and onward to how to change storage devices.  Hope that helps!  <answer89573> The PowerMac G5's hard drives are fairly straight forward to remove.  ol liMake sure to unplug the machine from power and disconnect all cables from the back of it./li liLift up the silver latch on the back side of the machine, this unlocks the door on the side of the machine./li liRemove the door from the side of the machine/li liThe hard drives are located in the upper right corner of the machine and are held in place by plastic tabs that rotate up and down/li liFlip/rotate the plastic tab holding the hard drive in place/li liDisconnect the two SATA cables from the hard drive.  This is kind of a tight fit but rocking the hard drive &amp; cables will help to release them/li liOnce the SATA cables are disconnected the hard drive should slide out.  The bottom one slides straight out, the upper one (if installed) drops a little bit then slides out./li /ol  iFixit guide for removing PowerMac G5 hard drives - Good reference with pictures  <comment105159> You should specify if this is referring to an iMac G5 or a PowerMac G5.  If it is an iMac then you should include whether or not it has an iSight camera, as the two different models are assembled quite differently. <comment105165> I'm so sorry, I not sure G5 has two models. After googling, is confirmed a PowerMac G5 <comment105200> haha .. looks like not that hard, will try that once I have back to office. <comment105241> with the photos, I manage to unplug hdd from 3 G5 in less than 10 minutes, thanks :) <comment105295> Thats great to hear!  Glad you got it worked out.
