Iphone storage is not updating after removing videos from phone <body> I have 32GB iphone 7, had 10gb of photos and it said i have 10GB free. Deleted 5GB of photos and it still says 10GB instead 15GB. How can I see correct amount?  If it is the case that icloud drive is still synching with phone, what is the point of icloudt drive ? I will just move all to google drive and remove stuff from icloud.  <comment371621> Did you delete the photos from the "Recently Deleted" album?
