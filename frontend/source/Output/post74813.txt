How to get Java 6 in OS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion)? <body> OS X 10.8 removed Java 6 and the Java Utilities switcher and made Java 7 the default jre making it hard for engineers like me who work exclusively on Java 6. How do I get back my Java 6? Note: I tried Google but many of the supposed solutions are outdated.  <answer74814> The simplest solution I found is to  ol liDownload the jdk6 (download button is on top right)/li liUnpack it to somewhere. Preferably to code/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/1.6/code. This is what it looks for me:  precode&gt; ls /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/1.6                                                                                                     Classes       Commands      Home          Info.plist    Libraries     MacOS    Resources   version.plist /code/pre/li liSet your code$JAVA_HOME/code to your new location by doing codeexport JAVA_HOME=/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/1.6/Home//code before your code$PATH/code in your code~/.bashrc/code (or code~/.zschrc/code) file/li liPrepend code$JAVA_HOME/code to your code$PATH/code by doing this codeexport PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/us........../code/li liRestart your shell or do codesource ~/.bashrc/code/li /ol  <comment103200> I think they have changed the link to the JDK6 that you posted.  it now is a DMG with a .pkg installer.  Now way to extract it to a directory. <comment275806> @Amala The installer will use the mentioned directory automatically.
