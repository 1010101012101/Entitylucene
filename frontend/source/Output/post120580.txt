Color issues when waking up MBA connected to Apple Thunderbolt Display <body> I haven't got the faintest idea what is causing this issue, but hopefully somebody here has experienced it before.  When I haven't used my computer for a while I decide to wake it up from sleep by pressing a random button on my external keyboard. I have it set up so that the MBA itself is closed, i.e. the Thunderbolt Display is the only screen I am using.  The computer always wakes up immediately and most of the times it works just as expected, strongbut/strong sometimes the color of the display is shifted to a quite prominent purplish tone. When this happens I open and close the lid of the laptop, which immediately solves the problem, but I'm curious as to why the problem exists in the first place.  It started happening a few weeks ago and I have been using the MBA with the TB display since summer 2012.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/D53DI.jpg" alt="An image taken by my phone showing the discoloration."  Thank you in advance.  strongEDIT:/strong Just took a screenshot which after opening and closing the lid doesn't show any discoloration, which leads me to believe this is a hardware issue. Added a picture showing how it looks.  <answer126216> Contrary to my belief this is most probably a software issue since I cannot reproduce the problem after updating to the most recent version (10.9.2) of OSX.  <comment147802> Most recent is 10.9.2 in your case? <comment149040> That is correct.
