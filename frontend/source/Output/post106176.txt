Mavericks lock screen doesn't show screen saver <body> Prior to upgrading to Mavericks, when I chose to lock my MacBook Pro's screen, it would do so with my screen saver options (rotate through images in a folder, and show a clock). However, when I go to lock my screen now, it's simply a black screen.  Is there a way to make Mavericks use my screen saver settings when I choose to lock my screen as with older versions of OS X?  <answer106588> Check system preference - Security &amp; Privacy - General- Require password XXX after sleep or screen saver begins  <answer125548> Set one of the hot corners to start the screen safer.  The lock sends the display to sleep in mavericks - there's no option to change it afaik  <comment124881> How to do usually lock your screen ? <comment125167> That was the first thing I checked, and the box is checked. I have it set for immediately on the drop down. <comment125863> @AntoineLecaille I have the lock icon in my menu bar up top. <comment132006> @AntoineLecaille: If you go to Keychain Access-Preferences, and check "Show keychain status in menu bar", then a lock menu will appear allowing you to lock the screen. <comment146931> But if it doesn't lock the screen, then anyone can walk up to my machine and use it, so this isn't a solution. <comment146932> Go to security in system preferences. There you can set the amount of minutes (or immediately) until a password is requested after activating screen saver.
