Blue color lines on display <body> I recently updated to Mavericks OS of my MacBook Pro 13" inch which was bought on October 2012. I am having blue colored lines and strange shapes all over the display. I dont know whether its hardware or software issue. The following images will reveal my issue.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oiAFQ.png" alt="Login Screen"  <answer121322> Could be graphics card issue, check my question Macbook pro checkered display, safeboot works   I ended up replacing the logic board.   P.S: Talk to customer relations instead of call center and ask for free service in case of hardware failure.  <comment141384> Do you see these anomalies all the time or when using specific applications? Did this start after upgrading to OS X 10.9? <comment141402> Do they appear if you ⇧-boot (Safe Mode)? Do they appear if you ⌘S-boot (Single User Mode)? <comment141458> @GrahamMiln It comes and goes often. But when I am using Xcode(Its used to build iOS and Mac Apps), i'll get more and more lines all over display. <comment141459> @grgarside i never tried those method.. Will try today and let u know.
