iPod Click Wheel Games disappeared from iTunes <body> Is it still possible to buy iPod Click Wheel Games for the iPod Classic? I can't find them on iTunes. Is there a way to side-load them and get them from elsewhere?  <answer87155> They've been gone for a while. I don't remember exactly when, but it was more than a year ago. There's no way to buy them anywhere else.
