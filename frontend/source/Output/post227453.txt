To convert .iso file to .img file while trying to dual boot with linux <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6DB1T.png" alt="enter image description here"  It says no such file or directory.where did I go wrong?   <answer227455> Your path, by the looks of it, ought to bebr code~/Downloads//code or code~/Desktop//code rather thanbr code~/Users/Yourname/…/code  code~//code is already the shortcut to code/Users/Yourname//code  You can also use the codefile/code command to check that the file you are converting already exists. Copy the path and paste it after codefile/code at the shell. You can also shorten the directories, by changing to the folder  precodecd ~/Downloads mv file ~/Desktop cd ~/Desktop ls ubuntu*iso hdiutil convert -o ubuntu.img -format UDRW ubuntu*iso /code/pre  The ls command makes sure there is only one file starting with ubuntu and ending in iso on your desktop - you can put the whole file path instead of using the * that I used for brevity if you have more ISO files that match on the desktop.  <comment276252> I have to disagree with "`~/` is already the shortcut to `/Volumes/Macintosh HD/Users/Yourname/`" since in this reference `~` is actually the value of `$HOME` which under OS X is typically e.g. `/Users/username` not `/Volumes/Macintosh HD/Users/username`. <comment276256> semantics… it still arrives at that point, `bootdrive/users/me/` <comment277729> In the past; I'm pretty sure all that I needed to do was change the filename extension, via `mv`, for instance.
