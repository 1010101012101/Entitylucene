Kextual Healing: How can I remove Kexts that appear on startup? <body> On my Mac I have a load of Kexts appearing that read like this (there are 14 or so):     The system extension "/System/Library/Extensions/BJUSBLoad.kext" was installed improperly and cannot be used...   Now they didn't start appearing after I consciously did anything, and I've read various threads about it elsewhere. I wonder if there is a programming solution here (using Terminal, perhaps) - something that will suppress the kexts? They mostly seem to relate to hp printer drivers, that sort of thing. Stuff I never use.  None of them seem to relate to things in my Login Items in System Preferences.  After discussing this on StackOverflow, I received some advice to run kextutil -n on them:  precodekextutil -n /System/Library/Extensions/BJUSBLoad.kext /code/pre  So I did that, and got this:      /System/Library/Extensions/BJUSBLoad.kext - dependency 'com.apple.kernel.libkern' not found. Diagnostics for /System/Library/Extensions/BJUSBLoad.kext: Warnings: Personality CFBundleIdentifier differs from containing kext's (not necessarily a mistake, but rarely done): IJ170b...etc.    The message goes on, and ends like this:      Kext has no executable or compatible version, so it should not declare any OSBundleLibraries.br   Code Signing Failure: not code signed   Any idea why or what I need to do?  <answer253345> See this Apple Support Communities thread - it addresses your exact problem (specifically, this response).   If you still have issues, prevent the kext from loading by using codesudo/code + codekextunload/code instead of codekextutil/code. For example:   precodesudo kextunload /System/Library/Extensions/BJUSBLoad.kext  /code/pre  codekextutil/code would be appropriate for debugging purposes (corrupted, missing dependencies, deprecated, etc) in the hopes of repairing it. codekextunload/code is the tool you are looking for - see the man page for more info on it.   <comment315990> Thanks so much! That thread & that response solved my problem, so I didn't need to do kextunload. Thanks <comment316282> @tardypigeon welcome! glad I could help. Cheers buddy :)
