What is meant by Lemon Experience? <body> I am not sure that is this the place to ask this question, but I heard of Lemon Experience on Mac. What does it mean? is it some hardware failure or software issue?  <answer13783> I believe the phrase you've heard is probably in reference to a faulty/dud piece of equipment, as per the definition:  precode"(informal) a person or thing, esp. an automobile, regarded as unsatisfactory, disappointing, or feeble" /code/pre  I don't think it's something Apple or Mac specific, and in fact is probably more often used with non Apple products.  <answer13805> In the US there is a body of law known as "lemon laws" that arose from car sales. Basically, if a car is sold to a consumer and the manufacturer is unable to remedy a specific covered fault after the consumer has presented the vehicle for numerous repair attempts, these laws provide additional protection to consumers.   Perhaps this question might be migrated to a consumer law answer board unless someone can uncover a mac connection.   <comment14643> I've been a regular Mac user for seven years and have never once heard the term "Lemon Experience" used in regard to Apple or Mac products. <comment14647> If you don't get an answer here, you can maybe try the [English SE site](http://english.stackexchange.com/). <comment14656> Can you provide a source to the use of this terminology? I know what it means to "buy a lemon" or "own a lemon", but "a Lemon Experience" is a new one to me. <comment14659> Another long time Mac user who has never heard of that phrase in conjunction with Apple. <comment14668> Add me to the list of ignorants. I've never heard of it. Maybe it's related to Apples and Oranges? :) <comment14695> Perhaps your looking for a [Lemon Parser](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemon_Parser_Generator) (part of SQLite) or the LEMON C++ library: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LEMON_(C%2B%2B_library) ? <comment14697> +1. Searching `"lemon Experience" Apple Mac OS` brings up the slang for a lot of things, not just Mac. <comment14716> This and bmike's answers are probably the correct answer, it's the general understanding of what it means to own/buy a lemon, I'm still very curious about the specific source(s) that caused the OP to ask the question. <comment14805> The answers below are correct. I _have_ heard it used to describe a mac. (Once, and only once). It is used to describe an unlucky experience where a switcher's first purchase is one of the rare cases that there are a lot of problems in a short time. The result is often that the user gets frustrated and switches back to Windows.
