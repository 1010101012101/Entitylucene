double superscript in keynote <body> Is there a way to do a double superscript/subscript in keynote?   I mean superscript of a superscript, e.g., (in latex notation) $a^{2^n}$.  <comment192222> Have you tried raising the baseline after making it superscript? http://support.apple.com/kb/PH6034 <comment192224> I think for such an expression it's best to use an equation editor, like MathType or a Latex generator, and then insert the resulting image/object into your keynote doc.  Keynote has an Insert  Mathtype menu item.
