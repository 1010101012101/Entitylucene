Apple ID not accepted even though it's the correct information <body> My email address is correct for my Apple ID and was working well until I installed an update to iTunes. After the machine restarted it refused to accept my email address as my Apple ID. I have had this email address for many years, so there is no other one.  <comment341144> What happens if you try signing in at [https://appleid.apple.com](https://appleid.apple.com)? There is probably nothing we can do for you here, were not Apple Support, and if need be contact Apple directly. <comment341145> Possible duplicate of [How can I bypass Activation Lock?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/114985/how-can-i-bypass-activation-lock)
