is there a way to force iCloud sync? <body> On my mac, i deleted a bunch of songs and checked "delete from iCloud" checkbox. On my iPhone (10 minutes later), songs are still there.  Is there a way to force the sync between devices on demand? (and ultimately delete them from iPhone)  <comment250891> So much has changed with iCloud, I'm closing this. If this can have a specific OS certiorari and explanation on if this is about iTunes music or files in iCloud documents, we can certainly reopen it as less broad/more clear. <comment250892> I've tried updating my icloud.com e-mail account in Mail app on my iPhone and it helped. <comment250893> How exactly did you "update" your account? Log out and in again? <comment250894> No. Just checked for new mail. <comment250895> On my mac it helped to press 'alt'&'cmd' - hoover the finder symbol and choose "restart finder"... then it started a new synch process...
