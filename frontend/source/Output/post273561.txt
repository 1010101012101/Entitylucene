Can I safely delete a “.keychain” file from Keychains when there is a corresponding “.keychain-db” file? <body> In the folder “Keychains” in my Library folder (code~/Library/Keychains/code), I have a file “login.keychain” and a file “login.keychain-db”. Is the file “login.keychain” still being used in macOS Sierra, or is it safe to delete it?  I have a few other keychains with pairs of these files “emname/em.keychain” and “emname/em.keychain-db”. But when I create a new keychain in Keychain Access, there’s only a file “emname/em.keychain-db”. Based on this and the modification times of the files, I’m guessing Sierra only uses the new files (“emname/em.keychain-db”), but that the upgrade left the old files (“emname/em.keychain”) in place as a backup? So it should be safe to remove the old files?  <comment343963> Have you tried renaming the files or moving them to a different folder and checking if you can still access them in Keychain?
