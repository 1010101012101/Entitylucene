Safari saves PDF as .pdf.jpeg because of faulty mimeType <body> When I try to open a PDF link by clicking on it, Safari saves it as filename.pdf.jpeg, then tries to open it in Preview, and claims that the file is broken.  I checked the requests to see what's wrong, and apparently the system serving the images sends a faulty mimeType and size:  precode"content": {     "size": 0,     "mimeType": "image/jpeg" } /code/pre  Chrome just ignores this and figures out what kind of file it is, but Safari seems to trust the server, and saves a 0 size JPEG.  I can't use the right click - codeDownload linked file/code, that just does the same thing. And using codeDownload linked file as/code only tries to save the .ashx file the server gets the request through.  I've sent an email to the company responsible for the system, but I'm hoping there's a way around this anyway. Any ideas?  <comment99815> No that is how the web is designed use the mime type. The only way is the right click download and then rename the file <comment99816> Unless you insist in using Preview, install Adobe reader. <comment99929> @Mark & Borderline Yes, but since the file is served through a .ashx handler, I can't even get the file from the server. Safari insists on saving a 0kb jpeg. It cannot be opened by anything because it didn't get saved right. And considering Chrome and other browsers do it, it seems quite possible to just check the incoming datastream to figure out what the file actually is.
