Filter RSS feeds on iPad <body> I'm looking for an app to read my rss feeds from my favourite websites but with a filtering feature by keywords. For example every article from a website that contains the word "pluto". On my mac I use RSS Bot to do so, but now that I have an iPad I don't know how can I do that again. Any help?  <answer209528> I highly recommend the newly updated Net News Wire for iOS (and Mac if you choose the extra bonus ability to have one unified feed synced across both OS).  ul lihttp://netnewswireapp.com/li lihttp://netnewswireapp.com/ios//li /ul  The original author is a long time renowned developer and the current owners are equally respected in the community for doing top notch work.  <comment252750> yep, thanks, but there is no filtering feature in this app" <comment252769> @hiru I use the search function to make excellent filters. I don't know if they will add smart folders or a more explicit filter, but I bet it's on the planning board if not something they have started coding for. <comment252780> well, in this case, thanks, I'll surely keep an eye on it!
