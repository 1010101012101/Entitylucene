iOS Beta Sign Up Not Working <body> I sign in, and go to the sign up page. That's where I have to accept the terms. Everytime I click the accept button, it reverts back to the sign up page.   It's not taking me to the download profile page.   I'm on mobile safari iOS 9.3.3 and wondering if I can enroll from that device or if e signup process is broken?  <answer247773> You could use this link to install the iOS 10 beta(Developer): https://goo.gl/6Ki6Q0 This link will automatically download the profile, no apple id needed.  I found the link on this youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDNl4Xc1SnI  The iOS 10 Dev beta is better than the public beta because apple releases updates for it quicker than the public beta.  <comment305724> Welcome to Ask Different. what browser version and OS are you using to sign in? Are you looking for help with your computer or perhaps looking for Apple's support department to check that your Apple ID password is correct? <comment305730> I'm using 9.3.3, on my iPhone. I know my password is correct. I have a bug that everytime I click accept on the beta page. It reverts back to the signup page. <comment305764> The iOS 10 Developer Beta requires a paid Developer account to access. The link you have provided ultimately violates the terms and conditions of not disseminating the version(s) of iOS not yet released to the public.
