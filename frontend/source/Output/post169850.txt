Shortcut to switch to full screen apps <body> There is a shortcut to switch to desktop 1...N in OS X. But usually I have only one desktop and other apps (Chrome, iTerm, etc) in full screen mode.   Is there a way to make shortcuts to switch to these apps?  For example, I would like this configuration:  ul listrongF1/strong - switch to desktop, it holds Skype, Finder, etc (already done)/li listrongF2/strong - switch to Chrome (full screen)/li listrongF3/strong - switch to iTerm (full screen)/li liand so on/li /ul
