How do I connect my PC to a Thunderbolt Display? <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   Are there adapters to use Thunderbolt Display with non-Thunderbolt computers?       So, I have a MacBook Air and a 27" Thunderbolt display. I was under the impression that I could connect my PC (Asus Laptop) to the Thunderbolt display by using a HDMI to Mini Displayport converter. However, it doesn't seem to be working. Is there some technical limitation as to why this isn't working?  <answer34174> Sorry, but currently it's not possible. Thunderbolt ports on Macs can output a Mini Displayport signal, but the Thunderbolt emDisplay/em can only receive a Thunderbolt signal, nothing else. It's possible that an adapter to do this could be released in the future, but IMO that's unlikely or if it happens will be quite expensive.  <comment38994> What video out and other ports does your Asus include?
