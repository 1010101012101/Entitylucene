MacBook keys built in keyboard and trackpad unresponsive on 10.10.4 <body> For about three weeks now, my MacBook Pro, late 2012, 13 inch's keyboard and trackpad have been unresponsive. Specifically, the keys, going from ~ to = and down to z (so every letter, number and symbol key, excluding caps lock) do not work alone. The function keys also do not respond. All types of commands work, as long as the command, option, or control keys are used (for example: I do a NVRAM and SMC restarts with the keys) and I can shutdown the MacBook with the power button. External peripherals, like keyboard and mouse, work and all USB ports are responsive. The cursor stays in the upper left corner when I restart the computer and cannot be moved with the built in trackpad. br I have tried restoring a backup from 10.10.3 but that still did not fix the problem. Would this be a software issue? br I visited many different forums and posts concerning unresponsive keyboards and trackpads, but none of the solutions I have tried have fixed this. Thank you in advance.  <comment230665> Take a look at System Preferences | Accessibility.  You may have activated sticky keys or Enable Slow Keys. <comment243759> I have had the same problem since updating to 10.10.4 my trackpad is acting up intermittently, even after wiping the drive and installing older system versions. It seems software related as the behavior goes away as soon as you switch apps etc.
