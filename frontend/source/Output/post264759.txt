How to disable unnecessary tasks on macOS Sierra? <body> My 2013 MacBook Pro Retina stopped working today and I have to use a 2010 white Macbook instead for a while (this is terrible, I have to admit. But this macbook look really better than today's macbooks). Anyway here is my question :  Since I don't want to have a 2010's experience with browsing, I updated my mac to macOS Sierra. At first it was really slow but then I disabled animations, transparency, disabled weather, calendars, iCloud (it was impressively faster after I disabled it), notifications etc.  Is there a tutorial or someone out there to explain how disable all unnecessaries tasks such as the ones on I mentioned ?   Thank you !   Sorry I didn't explain how I did it :   strongTo turn off transparency/strong : go to system preferences  accessibility  display  reduce transparency   strongTo turn off notifications/strong : system preferences  notifications  then click on 'Not in Notifications'  strongTo disable iCloud/strong : System preferences, iCloud and disable  strongTo disable Mission Control/strong : I followed these steps    <comment331905> Could you start by letting us know how you did it? I have no idea how to do that at all!
