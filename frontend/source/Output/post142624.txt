How do I extend the end of a clip in iMovie? <body> Need help with an iMovie I am putting together for a memorial this weekend.  I've finished the movie, but was hoping to extend the first clip.  Since I am using a 'ken burns' crop for the clip, the view pans from the bottom of the photo to the top in the clip.  Once the view reaches the top of the photo, I'd like it to hold for about four seconds.  I can't seem to make that happen, even if I'm using the inspector.  Any step by step tips folks can offer up would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!
