Is there a convenient service for printing lenticular (animated) prints from an iPhone "Live Photo" <body> Lenticular printing of Live Photoes feels like a service that ought to exist but I've found only places that do (a) odd sizes, (b) expensive, custom quotes for bulk orders, or (c) both.  <answer264850> Gifpop offers lenticular printing for GIFs. I haven't used them, but it looks like they are consumer-friendly in terms of pricing and small/one-off orders. They offer square and a couple of roughly 3x5 sizes.  You could use an app to convert some or all frames of your Live Photo to a GIF (Gifpop supports up to 10 frames per print), and then use Gifpop to produce your print.
