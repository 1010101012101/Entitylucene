Getting Swedish Apple keyboard to map the same way in Bootcamp (Windows 7) <body> Whenever I use Windows 7 through Bootcamp, my keyboard mappings are totally different. Many special keys get mapped to what they would be on a PC keyboard, which is a real pain since I program on both platforms (and I am mostly used to the mac layout). The problem characters are these: []{}|\  On my SE Mac keyboard, I use these combinations:  ul li[] - any alt + 8/9 /li li{} - any alt + shift + 8/9/li li| - any alt + 7/li li\ - any alt + shift + 7/li /ul  When in Bootcamp, it behaves like a Swedish PC keyboard:  ul li[] - right alt + 8/9/li li{} - right alt + 7/0/li li| - right alt + /li li\ - right alt + ?/li /ul  I have tried numerous keyboard settings without any difference. I was able to switch control and command using a register key but I have found no way to switch the combinations above.  Is there any way to fix this?  As I understand it, US keyboards  do not have this problem since the above keys maps the same way on Mac and PC keyboards. I really envy that...  <answer171758> You can probably get what you want by creating a Windows layout with the Apple mapping. The tool for making such things is at http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/goglobal/bb964665.aspx   <comment201987> Normally to get what you want you need to create a Windows layout with the Apple mapping (unless you see one in the Windows settings called Swedish Apple).

I've seen that tool before but was unable to map left alt and left alt+shift as shift states (I use left alt for all the special chars on mac). However, I tried it again now and instead mapped with alt-gr (right alt). Then I used SharpKeys to switch left alt and right alt. Not so pretty but it actually works. Only downside is that shortcuts such as alt-tab now use the right alt key. But I guess I can live with that. At least I can write code like a normal person now! Btw, there is a Swedish Apple layout, but it maps just like a PC keyboard.
