How to open a specific pane in system preferences from dock? <body> When I add the system preferences to the dock and click it, it opens in the common view.  How can I open a specific pane at once from the dock? img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4bWyh.png" alt="system settings specific pane"  <answer49710> If System Preferences is running, the Dock menu has a list of all available preference panes. If it's not running, they aren't in the menu because apps on OS X can't keep stuff in the Dock when they're not running.   For easy access to a specific preference pane, use Spotlight or a third-party launcher.  <answer49711> If it's a particular pane you want then you can use AppleScript to do this. For example, start the AppleScript Editor and type the following:  precodetell application "System Preferences"     activate     set current pane to pane "com.apple.preference.startupdisk" end tell /code/pre  This will open the Startup Disk preference pane codecom.apple.preference.startupdisk/code, but the other panes follow the same naming convention, e.g. codecom.apple.preference.dock/code etc.   You can now save this an application:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VbRMm.png" alt="enter image description here"  Then drag the .app file you created to the Dock. When you double-click it, it will open the required preference pane.   <answer49712> ul liIn Finder, open code/System/Library/PreferencePanes/code on Lion for the system preference panes or code/Library/PreferencePanes/code or code~/Library/PreferencePanes//code for user-added ones./li liDrag the icon of your choice from the folder to the Dock. It will probably only go on the right side (the documents/folders/minimized windows/Trash side) of the divider./li /ul  Clicking the new icon will open System Preferences directly to that preference pane.  <answer111305> I see this is an old post, but at OS X.7 (Lion) and X.8 (Mountain Lion), at least, show the full list by just clicking and HOLDING on the System Preferences icon in the Dock.  <comment56895> You can also use Automator or AppleScript Editor to create an application that will open a particular prefpane; see the scripting dictionary for System Preferences in AppleScript Editor. <comment56897> +1 Despite my own answer, I really like this one :-) You also get the "correct" icon of the prefpane you want, as opposed to the default AppleScript one. Works as you describe on Lion too, but the path is `/System/Library/PreferencePanes` for system panes and `/Library/PreferencePanes` or `~/Library/PreferencePanes` for user ones. <comment56906> It's the same in Lion - you can only drag it to the right of the striped divider. <comment56951> The path has been `PreferencePanes` for a lot longer than Lion. <comment196094> What about preference panes that have spaces and ampersands in them like, "Security & Privacy"? I need to show the privacy pane.
