What is build number of the OS X Lion version released on the app store July 20th 2011? <body> Can someone tell me what is build number of the Lion version released on the app store July 20th 2011?  <answer17871> The Lion build is "Mac OS X Lion 10.7 (11A511)".  <comment19529> I have verified this. <comment19532> Sorry, someone modified my post, I want to know what's the build number of lion itself <comment19546> thanks, 11A511 is what I'm looking for <comment19550> Where do you see that? My "About This Mac" just says "Version 10.7" <comment19553> It's behind the "More Info" button on "About This Mac". <comment21303> Keep in mind: the new Macs ship with different build numbers (11A2051, or something like that). <comment72785> I believe that the build number of the app store released in OSX Lion is 1.1.1. The build number in Snow Leopard was 1.0.2 I believe. EDIT The build of Mac OSX Lion itself is 11A511. It turns out that the build number of the GM and the now are the same.
