"The application “%@” can’t be opened." However doing "open with" and selecting default app works <body> Using macOS Sierra, when I double click a file that is supposed to open with Atom I get this message:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0RZQr.png" alt="enter image description here"  However if I right click and choose the default option it works fine:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kp4Wd.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer272416> Fixed by uninstalling atom (using appCleaner) and then reinstalling most recent version.  <comment341174> Try resetting the association. Get info on the file, set 'Open With' to Atom [even if it shows already, select it again from the drop menu] & then 'Change All...' <comment341176> I tried that yesterday. Just tried changing the default app then swapping it back to atom. Problem is persisting <comment341177> Then it might be time to rebuild the Launch Services database. [Onyx](http://www.titanium.free.fr/onyx.html) [freeware] can do that, from Maintenance tab/Rebuilding <comment342383> You should post your update as an actual answer, not an edit to the question! <comment342384> @grgarside I suppose, although it does not answer why this is happening <comment342426> Yeah, Atom can be, well… annoying at times. It sometimes stores the ghost of a version and only leaves shortcuts to non existent files. The only way I have found to fix this is to delete and reinstall atom every once in a while. Hope they fix this soon!
