Why do I need to use sudo purge to free up memory and not doing it automatically? <body> I bought a macbook recently with 16GB of ram and with no reason sometimes it is using more than normal memory and I run su purge to free up memory. Is there any way we can make it do it by it's own?  <answer231969> Do not use purge Just leave it reuse the memory is free :o)  <comment283362> Stop purging the memory, you're just slowing the machine down unnecessarily - The modern paradigm is that empty memory is wasted memory, so the machine will fill the memory as it needs, to enable a faster response if any of that used memory is needed again. It is far faster to re-use memory than it is to empty it & refill it with the same data over & over, so it hangs onto used memory it thinks it is likely to need again. <comment283364> ok thank you so much <comment283365> Source? Reason? Why?
