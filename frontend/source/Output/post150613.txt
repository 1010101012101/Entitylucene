Tmux hampers osascripts display notification <body> I like to show notifications from scripts using codeosascript -e 'display notification "Some text"'/code.  This works fine from the plain shell but it stop working when in codetmux/code.  It just doesn't show the notification in codetmux/code. No errors or anything else is shown.  Has anyone else had this problem and how do I fix it?
