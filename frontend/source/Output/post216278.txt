iCloud 400 error can't sync or share on Yosemite 10.10.4 <body> MacBook Pro with Yosemite 10.10.4 can't share the events with my iPhone. I get error:      The server responded with “400” to operation   CalDAVUpdateShareesQueuableOperation.   I have tried all steps mentioned at this Apple discussion and Why does iCal often say &quot;The server responded: 403 to operation CalDAVSetPropertyQueueableOperation.&quot;  In the second link from StackExchange, it is suggested to move:  precode~/Library/Calendars/ ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.CalendarAgent ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iCal.plist /code/pre  However, I do not have a com.apple.CalendarAgent in that location. Also, after moving the other two from that suggestion, there are no more accounts under Calendar  Preferences and when trying to add an account, it will never add the account. It asks for login details, then returns to the blank account list with options to add. I assume putting the items from above back in their original location will fix this second issue but I will be back at the start with the 400 error issue.  What other methods are available to fix this issue?
