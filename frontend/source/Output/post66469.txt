FileVault unlock startup screen <body> I don't want anybody turning on my Mac seeing my name and user account picture (all user account configured on the computer, actually!) just because it defaults to choosing a user to unlock the drive.  ul liHow can I get two simple username/password text fields instead of the "personal" login screen? This is possible for a "normal" login screen.../li /ul  <answer66868> This is easy to do.    ol liOpen System Preferences/li liClick on "Users &amp; Groups"/li liAt the bottom of the left window pane click on "Login Options"/li liChange the value of "Display login window as" from "List of users" to "Name and password"/li /ol  Now the login screen will show two simple username/password text fields.  <answer67054> There is no way currently to get login / password blanks at the FileVault 2 preboot login screen.  <comment78753> Nope... not with FileVault... have you tested this? <comment78905> @Hair of the Dog: The login screen is NOT the Filevault unlock screen. <comment79027> If anyone on the planet knew a workaround for this, my money would be on [Rich Trouton](http://derflounder.wordpress.com/2012/09/22/fdesetup-authrestart-filevault-2s-one-time-encryption-bypass-feature/). I'm looking forward to hearing you speak in Minneapolis at the [JAMF conference](http://www.jamfsoftware.com/events/user-conferences/jamf-nation-user-conference-2012) :-)
