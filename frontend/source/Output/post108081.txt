Why is Intel 520 SSD slow in my Mac Pro? <body> I have a 2010 Mac Pro running OS 10.9 on an Intel 520 SSD.  I've noticed read/write times are much slower than Intel claims. Is there anything I can do about this?  Intel's claim: Sustained sequential read: 550MBps Sustained sequential write: 520MBps  Since the Mac Pro has SATA II, that should bottleneck speed to 375MBps.  With Blackmagic Disk Speed Test, I get 150MBps write, 260MBps read.  Using command-line tools, I see 231MBps read and 522MBps write, but that's obviously false — maybe it's using a RAM cache.  precode$ time mkfile 4000000000 test  real    0m17.293s user    0m0.836s sys 0m16.215s $ time cp test /Volumes/RAID  real    0m7.667s user    0m0.005s sys 0m3.545s /code/pre
