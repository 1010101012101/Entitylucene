No Shark on OS X Lion? <body> I can't find Shark on OS X Lion. The most recent Xcode is correctly installed, but I can only see Instruments. Has Shark been made obsolete by Instruments ?  <answer30838> Correct.  Shark was replaced with Instruments. There is a set of tools from Apple called CHUD that does still include Shark.  It's available here. It does require you to have a Developer Account to download. However there has been limited success in getting it to work on Lion.  It's safe to assume that Shark has bitten the dust.  <comment35418> Well, it's fine. Instruments is clearly a good replacement, it works well and it's less confusing. I used Shark just because I got used to it, but I won't miss it. <comment44294> Hey - have you considered volunteering here to be a moderator? http://apple.stackexchange.com/election
