How do you disable the zoom effect / window animations in the new OS X Lion? <body> I'd like to disable the Zoom effect that the windows produce when they are being opened. Does anyone know a way to disable them?  <answer18585> Open Terminal.app In your /Applications/Utilies folder and run the following command:  precodedefaults write NSGlobalDomain NSAutomaticWindowAnimationsEnabled -bool NO /code/pre  and press kbdEnter/kbd  Note: Changes might only take place after restarting your mac  <comment20381> The command is `defaults write NSGlobalDomain NSAutomaticWindowAnimationsEnabled -bool NO` and the change is instant. The next app you launch will just appear rather than zooming into existence. No need to restart. <comment20446> That's great :P I didn't want to try it myself because I rather like the new animations, but I can understand how a slower machine might have problems with it.
