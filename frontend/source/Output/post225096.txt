Import passwords from Safari to Chrome <body> I am just switching from Safari to Chrome in my MacBookPro and first thing I did was to import bookmarks from Safari. Now I would also like to import passwords from websites, logins etc.  In emChrome  Settings  Sign In  Advanced Sync Settings/em, I have already checked every available sync option, however just google account passwords have been imported, not Safari's.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HrG1l.png" alt="enter image description here"  I also tried emChromeImport Bookmarks and SettingsFrom SafariImport/em, but still no results.  Does anyone know how to import Safari/Keychain passwords to Chrome?  <answer283382> I Think these depend on you Gmail account or which account you used for Sync your passwords... so in chrome you just add you same Gmail or other account and you get your Sync password automatically.
