Son's iphone photos showing up on my phone and vice-versa <body> My child's iphone is linked to my apple ID, which is what I want. When he takes photos with his iphone,however, they show up on mine and vice-versa. How do I stop this?  <comment326184> By not using the same ID. Investigate [Family Sharing](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201060)  instead. One adult in charge, others with differing responsibilities, including parental control.
