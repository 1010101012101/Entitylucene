screensaver that takes a screenshot <body> I'd like to make my screensaver look just like an unlocked desktop.  The idea would be to take a screenshot just before activating the screensaver, and use that screenshot in the screensaver.  Has anyone done this before?  <answer146662> You can use strongScriptSaver/strong.  ol liSet the AppleScript to a script containing the following:  precodedo shell script "/usr/sbin/screencapture /path/to/folder/screensaver.png" /code/pre  sup/path/to/folder must exist and be empty, or at least contain no other images/sup/li liSet the screen saver to display after the AppleScript to Classic./li liIn System Preferences, set the folder for the Classic screensaver to the /path/to/folder./li /ol  <answer146684> If you do find a screensaver that can play different images on each display. ( I have my doubts)  Then you can use the strongscreencapture/strong shell command to capture both screens in their own image file.  precodedo shell script "/usr/sbin/screencapture -R\"0,0,2560,1440\" /path/to/folder/screensaver1.png;/usr/sbin/screencapture -R\"2558,0,4480,12000\" /path/to/folder/screensaver2.png" /code/pre  The -R option  "x,y,width,height" will capture screen rect.  To get both displays in one image.  precodedo shell script "/usr/sbin/screencapture -R\"0,0,4480,1200\" /path/to/folder/screensaver3.png" /code/pre  <answer186181> This seems to do exactly what you want. I use it to secure a machine that shows a dashboard. It works great.  http://www.monkeybreadsoftware.de/Software/Transparent.shtml  <comment172784> A complication is that I have two displays. The Classic screensaver doesn't seem to have support for dual screen display. It always displays the same image on both screens, which doesn't really satisfy my requirement. Do you know a workaround? <comment172803> @bukzor I don't have multiple displays, but if you can find a screen saver that will display any image (or folder of images) like the standard screen savers then this method should work fine with that.
