Create a default folder structure & insert current Date in Terminal by single command? <body> I often find myself creating the same structure by hand in finder for new projects, how can I quicken this process with a single Terminal Command?  Example of structure &amp; command:  Terminal $ cf Project_Name      //cf for CreateFolder  Creates a folder in the current Path with current Date - YYMMDD Project_Name  In that folder a custom structure:  _CI  _layout  _layout/_screens  _material  <answer77629> Something like  precodemkdir -p "`date "+%Y%m%d"` Project_Name"/_layout/_screens /code/pre  should do the trick.  It is plain vanilla unix.  <comment90023> Great thanks, I added this now to my .functions cf () {  mkdir -p "`date "+%y%m%d"` $1"/_layout/_screens  mkdir -p "`date "+%y%m%d"` $1"/_material/  cd "`date "+%y%m%d"` $1"  open . }
