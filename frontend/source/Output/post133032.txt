Performances : Intel HD3000 vs AMD Radeon HD 6490M <body> I'm working on a MBP 15" 2011 with a new motherboard (Apple changed the previous one in december) and I've now this config :  ul lii7 Quad 2.0Ghz;/li li12 GB DDR3;/li li250GB SSD samsung 840;/li liIntel HD 3000;/li liAMD Radeon HD 6490M./li /ul  So my system should not be to slow... But when I run Unigine benchmarks here's the results :  With the 6490M :   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mn4VL.png" alt="enter image description here"  And with the HD 3000 :  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TPp5d.png" alt="enter image description here"  So I conclude that my chispet is faster than my real graphic card and I'm strongvery/strong disappointed.  Am I the only one ? Should I go and see Apple (once again !) about that ?  <comment157569> you are right, but that is 5% difference ? <comment157571> @Buscar웃 Yes, the HD 3000 is 9% faster than the AMD. And that's a shame. <comment157572> If you are using the FPS as benchmark then yes, however if you change (lower) the resolution the FPS will go up significantly. <comment157573> @Buscar웃 I'm not complaining about having 2FPS (which I can get higher with lower resolution), I'm complaining about having the same result with both cards as Apple says the AMD is for heavy treatment and the Intel is for battery saving. If they have the same performance that is useless, isn't it ? <comment157574> you can say that, but consider that the AMD has its build in cpu and memory, so it does runs faster when your HD3000 can only share that.
