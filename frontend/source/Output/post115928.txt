Terminal problem with Ctrl + Arrow and Shift + Arrow keys <body> I am running Mavericks on a new Macbook Pro. When I use the kbdCtrl/kbd and kbdShift/kbd keys together with the arrow keys, I get some sort of key codes as output in the terminal. I am pretty sure that this problem is new and that it didn't happen a few days ago. But I am not 100% sure. Anyway, this is what happens:  If I press kbdCtrl/kbd+kbd←/kbd (Left arrow), code;5D/code is output in the terminal. Similarly:    ul likbdCtrl/kbd+kbd→/kbd (Right arrow) outputs code;5C/code/li likbdShift/kbd+kbd←/kbd (Left arrow) outputs code;2D/code/li likbdShift/kbd+kbd→/kbd (Right arrow) outputs code;2C/code/li /ul  As I mentioned, I am pretty sure that before today I could use those shortcuts to move between words and select text. Has anyone seen this before? I have already looked through some of the existing questions about arrow key shortcuts, but I have found no references to this exact problem.   Also, note that I have turned off the keyboard shortcut that moves between desktops using the kbdCtrl/kbd + arrow keys.   <answer116000> The same thing happens on my 10.9 and 10.8 VMs. Control-arrows and shift-arrows don't do anything by default in bash. Where were you even using shift-arrows to select text? emacs or vim?  If you want to use control-left and control-right to move between words in bash, add these lines to code~/.inputrc/code:  precode"\e[1;5C": forward-word "\e[1;5D": backward-word /code/pre  To use shift-arrows in Emacs, map shift-up to code\e[1;2A/code, shift-down to code\e[1;2B/code, shift-right to code\e[1;2C/code, and shift-left to code\e[1;2D/code. If pressing shift-up results in a message like code&lt;select&gt; is undefined/code, try setting codeTERM/code to codexterm-vt220/code.  <answer224807> An alternative:   In Terminal preferences go to Advanced and unselect 'Paste newlines as carriage returns'.  Then use Sublime to write out complicated com  <comment135696> Your arrow keys are remapped somewhere to use `\],-` (the ascii equivalent of hex 5C 5D 2C 2D). <comment136000> Would you care to elaborate? I am very new to OSX. Where would I look for these remappings? <comment136003> I guess I may have been wrong about using the shift-arrows to select text. I am a developer with 13 years of experience but this is my first go at OSX. Very confused so far. <comment136005> Figured out the .inputrc thing. Looked everywhere for the file until I realised I have to create it myself. :) I can now move between words again. So thanks for that, I am marking this as the answer. Just a couple more questions so I am 100% clear: 1: I have now switched to using iTerm2. Is there any way, using .inputrc or otherwise, to get Shift+Left and Shift+Right to select text in iTerm2? 2: You mentioned emacs and vim. Aren't these just text editors? How would I use them as a terminal? <comment136162> I don't know any way to make shift-left and shift-right modify the selection in iTerm 2. I thought you might have used them just in Emacs. <comment136172> Alright. I'll have to live without it for now. Thanks! <comment336866> It doesn't work on macos Sierra, Shift + Right Arrow or Shift + Left Arrow doesn't do anything.
