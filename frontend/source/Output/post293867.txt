I need auto suggest back! <body> My auto-suggest disappeared when I updated to iOS 10.3.3. How do I get it back? It was so helpful to me.  <answer293874> There are two places to enable it:  ol liOpen strongSettings/strong → strongKeyboard/strong and emenable/em codePredictive/code. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OoeMH.jpg" width="375"/li liWith the keyboard on the screen, long-press the kbd/kbd key (or kbd/kbd if you’ve only got 1 keyboard installed) and emenable/em codePredictive/code. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EDa2x.jpg" width="375"/li /ol  <comment370856> Personally I find predictive text very poor as it has a small vocabulary and can't always predict the words I want to use, so it remains OFF. Good answer though. <comment370858> I kept it off on 4” iPhones because it just takes so much space. I also find it too slow to update to be helpful in most situations. With larger screens however I can afford the once-in-a-blue-moon instances where it comes in handy, especially for auto-completing long/difficult words
