TimeMachine's strange behavior <body> I have MacBook Air i7 with Mavericks. For some time I observe strange behavior of the TimeMachine: When I want to access backups, it shows all the time-points with archives on the right size, as it should, and then all disappear. This does not occur every time, but in more than 1/2 of my attempts. When I repeatedly (couple of times) eject my external hdd, finally, TimeMachine allows me to inspect my backups. I really do not understand why this happens.  Please, can anyone help me?  Many thanks, PM  <comment162112> Elaborate on the Disappear. <comment162153> Well, that is really awkward: when I launch TimeMachine, just very briefly I see that it recognizes some past backups -- on the right side of the screen there are this calendar-like stripes with dates of the backups, they show briefly and then they disappear and I cannot select anything, so I need to hustle with ejecting the external hdd & selecting backup disk (and, possibly, to repeat this for a few times)... Very annoying... <comment162300> Did you check to make sure that those backups actually exist on the Time Machine backup disk? <comment162479> Is this a real question?! :-) I mean, of course that I checked which external hdd I plugged in... As I said: I *can see* past backups for a brief moment...
