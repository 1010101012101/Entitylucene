Why do the speakers on my Macbook Pro crackle sometimes? <body> I've noticed that from time to time the speakers on my Macbook Pro (OS X 10.8) make a strong and harsh crackling sound instead of, or over the top of, a sound effect they are supposed to be playing. In particular, I've noticed this happens with Lotus Sametime notifications (i.e. the ping when I get a new message), but I've also noticed it happening with other applications. It only seems to happen with short sounds, not continuous ones - for example, playing videos always has perfectly smooth and error-free sound. It seems to happen most shortly after I've booted up/resumed, and goes away after a while.  What might be causing this, and how might I fix it?  <comment87241> Where do you live? I have had problems leaving out my old MBP in the snow. :P <comment87242> In the UK. The weather is mild, and I never use it out of doors. Of course, it is possible this is just a hardware fault, but I wanted to check if there were any potential software issues first. <comment87249> No, it is unlikely to be a software issue. I sometimes use USB speakers with Windows as well as Mac, and they too have the problem you describe (even the same sound!). In fact, I have this problem with all my LQ speakers if itâ€™s cold out here.
