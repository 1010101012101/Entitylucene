How to stop 'iCloud Download' column from reappearing <body> I don't want the iCloud Download column in iTunes; it really does nothing for me. Whenever I turn it off, it is there next time I open iTunes. This is so frustrating - is there any way to turn it off for good?  <answer201554> Seems not.  Best I can find it to just grab the column header &amp; drag it as far to the right as it will go.br At least it will stay there.  <answer206318> Check the "Only Music Available Offline" option in the [View] menu. Do this not only for Music, but also for Movies and TV Shows (switch to these views from the [view] menu also. THEN remove the iCloud Download column. It should remain gone now. :-)
