How can I upgrade my jailbroken and unlocked iPhone 3GS to 4.2? <body> I have an iPhone 3GS running on 4.0.1 and I want to upgrade it to 4.2 with my Mac. How can I go about doing this?  ul liCurrent Version: 4.0.1 (8A306)/li liModel: MB7... /li liModem Firmware: 05.13.04/li /ul  <answer6486> There is nothing special to upgrading when jailbroken or not. You must use the official upgrade path which means losing unlock and jailbreak, and then re-jailbreak and re-unlock if you want and if it is possible with the new firmware. So...  ol liPlug it in/li liFollow the prompts in iTunes/li /ol  <comment6844> Is it possible with the new firmware? I thought there was something special that you had to do. <comment6939> @michael it is possible and there is something special, only about 3GS. for more info: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/5264/is-there-a-jailbreak-for-ios-4-2/5276#5276
