Can't get Alt (Option) key to work while remote controlling a Mac from Windows with VNC <body> strongThe setup:/strong I'm using Windows 10, 8, 8.1 and 7 with a international keyboard, US keyboard, Windows keyboard, PC keyboard with VNC client TighVNC, RealVNC, UltraVNC to remote control a iMac, Mac mini, MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, running OS X, with Screen Sharing activated as the VNC server.  strongThe problem 1:/strong My keyboard mapping is all wrong, can't input codeAlt/code key(Option ⌥ ). It is identified as codeCommand/code key ⌘ .  strongThe problem 2:/strong My keyboard is international and a lot of the keys are wrongly mapped.  <answer246160> strongProblem 1)/strong Use RealVNC client. In my experience, codealt/code (Option) is in the Windows Key and Command is in the alt. Check out the documentation here https://www.realvnc.com/docs/mac-keyboard-mapping.html  There is no fix for the codealt/code (Option) key on TightVNC.  I tried to use software on the Mac to remap / change the keys functionality such as Karabiner (previously called KeyboardRemap4Macbook), Seil and even the native system Preferences  Keyboard  Modifier Keys to change codectrl/code for codealt/code or codecapslock/code for codealt/code , but it seems that when on VNC, those configurations are ignored. It's like a different keyboard is being used and it doesn't show up in the Select keyboard menu, only the local one.img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FTd4q.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongProblem 2)/strong VNC for some reason treats your keyboard as it were an US keyboard. You'll have to change in windows, the layout of your keyboard to US international, and by doing this, almost all your keys are going to be mapped correctly in the Mac. You can set different keyboard layout for different applications.img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GcGCr.png" alt="enter image description here"  I registered a issue on TightVNC sourceforge account about this, but the project seems to be dead, so no hope. Same problem happens on RealVNC.  For those keys that are still missing / dead a workaround is to use the Character map (while editing a text press codeCtrl/code + codealt/code + codespace-bar/code or at the menu select Edit  Emoji &amp; Symbols )img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KCG3U.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongAlternative/strong is to use a different remote desktop solution. If it's for personal use, go for TeamViewer. I tried and it's a lot better, with full support for the keyboard, better connection, imagem, etc, But if it's for business / comercial use, Teamviewer's price is just ridiculous IMO. The cheapest license called 'Business' cost U$ 749.
