RDP connection manager for Mac <body> Does anyone know if there are any RDP connection managers similar to Terminals or Microsoft Remote Desktop Connection Manager for the Mac? I'm aware of Royal TSX but $35 seems a bit steep for an RDP client.  CoRD is my current go-to but it does not allow for organization of connections within folders and is just a big long list. It also ends up always being fuzzy if I don't do full screen with it.  <answer101386> iTeleport manages both VNC and RDP connections, and is available on iOS and Mac, as well as Windows even.  Link to Mac App Store is here.  If cost is a consideration, try CoRD. (EDIT: Missed the fact that this was in the OP. My apologies.)  Other alternatives I've tried include iTap and Jump Desktop.  <comment119426> Yea if I was going to pay $30 I'd rather pay the extra $5 for Royal TSX. As I mentioned in my post, I'm using CoRD currently but the limitations for organizing my connections is lacking at best (I have over 200 servers spread out amongst various clients that I need to be able to somehow categorize or place in folders). <comment119429> Missed the second part of your post. Sorry about that! <comment119430> In lieu of a program to manage your various clients, you could save each as a shortcut to your Mac, and organize them in folders.
