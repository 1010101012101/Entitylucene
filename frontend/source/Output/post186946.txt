Git GUI for OSX that can show the pulled diff? <body> In windows TortoiseGit has the wonderful option to show the pulled diff after doing a pull.br Is there a Git GUI application for OSX that can do that?  I've tried SmartGit, SourceTree and the GitHub GUI but none of them seem to have this option.  <comment220846> The got ones will show what changed between commits so if you commit and then pull you will see the diffs <comment220856> Eh? What do you mean? I'm doing a pull and I want to see what changes my local repository just received from the remote. TortoiseGit shows all the files that were changed and allows double clicking on each file to see that diff that was merged to the local repository. <comment220898> Not really sure to understand what you meant, but if I figure it well, I think [Tower](http://www.git-tower.com) can do it. They have a trial version, but, it's not free. <comment220969> Using SourceTree you can view the diff from the last pull, simply by select the last commit and read the add and remove for each file.
