Microsoft Excel 15.25 - Dvorak keyboard <body> Still on Mac El Capitan...  So I'm a DVORAK keyboard user, big deal. 100 WPM ftw.  I notice, when I do simple commands like  Cmd + C (copy) Cmd + Z (undo)  Excel sorta acts up and "forgets" to convert that DVORAK to QWERTY input 5-10% of the time.   For example, when I do Cmd + Z, instead of Undo, it inputs current time (which is equivalent of Ctrl + ; on the Windows, cause Z is ; in Dvorak). This happens 5-10% of the time consistently.   Certainly very annoying. Imagine not being able to Undo, such a simple thing.   Only strongtemporary/strong solution now is switching to QWERTY while I'm using Excel (but I can't enjoy using DVORAK in Excel on Mac) img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uarCQ.png" alt="enter image description here"  I'm definitely the minority here, but anyone else facing this same issue?  Please reply if you're reading this 5 years later.
