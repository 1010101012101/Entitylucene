Window manager with "macro" support <body> So I'm using Moom and I really like it but lately I'm missing a window manager that can with one click setup my work/home environment. Especially I'm missing option to create multiple spaces and run apps with split view.  For example for my work env I would like to click one thing and run iTerm/Sublime Text in split view in one space.  In the other space I would love to get run 4 apps - chrome, hipchat, spotify and reeder each taking 1/4 of screen (I have 4k display at work).  Have you seen app that can do this or maybe I should start digging through JavaScript/AppleScript APIs to make it happen?  <comment334357> Take a look at [Hammerspoon](http://www.hammerspoon.org/go/). It is a Lua based desktop automation tool.
