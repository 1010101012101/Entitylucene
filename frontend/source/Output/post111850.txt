Insert a Web Page into a Presentation <body> On Windows, there is a PowerPoint plugin that allows live webpages to be inserted into a presentation.  I will be doing a presentation and it involves a web demo. I was wondering if a similar solution exists on the mac. It can be any presentation software, it just needs to have the ability to embed a live webpage and interact with that page.  supI am using OS X Mavericks on a mid-2012 Macbook Air./sup  <answer111895> Keynote '08 has the ability to do this by selecting codeInsert -&gt; Web View/code. Unfortunately, for some inexplicable reason, Keynote '09 omitted this feature. You can, however, create a presentation in the former, and use this object in the latter (or so I recall, as I no longer have Keynote '08 on which to test.)
