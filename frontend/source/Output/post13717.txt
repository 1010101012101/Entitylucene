How to copy iPhone 4 contacts to Exchange contacts? <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   Syncing iPhone Contacts with an Exchange Server       I have an iPhone 4 which until today, has had all my contacts stored on the iPhone.  I have just set up a new exchange account and have my iPhone configured to use this exchange account, at present, mail &amp; calendar but the final thing I want to do is get all of the contacts currently stored on the iPhone, into this new Exchange accounts contact list (at present, that exchange contact list is empty).  I've done a few Google searches and found plenty of discussions about copying from Exchange to the iPhone but not the other way around.  What's the best way of doing this (without manually going through each iPhone contact one-by-one and painfully copying each detail into the exchange contact list)?
