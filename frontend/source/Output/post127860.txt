free Apple apps for iPhone 4S? <body> Apple said that they make iPhoto, iMovie, Pages, Numbers, and Keynote free with iOS 7. I looked in the app store with my device (iPhone 4S) but the apps are not free. So it seems that is only valid for the new devices?  <answer127861> Yes, those apps you mentioned are free for new devices. ie, activated on or after September 1, 2013.     All five apps will be free if you meet the following criteria:      ol   liYou have to activate an iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch on or after September 1, and/li   liThe device has to be compatible with iOS 7, and you can check our complete list of devices that can run iOS 7, and/li   liYou have to install iOS 7, which will be available September 18. Before then, the apps will still have a price tag on them./li   /ol      Source.
