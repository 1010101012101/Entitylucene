El Capitan: will System Integrity Protection defence stop sandbox program from accessing System.log? <body> OS X El Capitan apparently has this new security feature known as codeSystem Integrity Protection/code, which limits root access to an array of files including: code/system/code, code/bin/code, code/sbin/code, code/usr/code, code/etc/code, code/tmp/code and code/var/code.  I have a program I developed which accesses the file codesystem.log/code located in the /var/log/ directory.  My Question is:   ul listrongWill my program (running in the sandbox) be able to access the file /var/log/system.log with the 'System Integrity Protection' system running?/strong/li /ul  Thanks in Advance.  <answer216229>    Will my program (running in the sandbox) be able to access the file code/var/log/system.log/code with the 'System Integrity Protection' system running?   Yes, a sandboxed application will be able to access code/var/log/system.log/code on OS X with System Integrity Protection (SIP) enabled.  h2code/var/code is Not Protected/h2  The code/var/code folder is not protected by SIP. As of OS X 10.11, only the following locations are protected:     Paths and applications protected by System Integrity Protection include:      ul   licode/System/code/li   licode/usr/code/li   licode/bin/code/li   licode/sbin/code/li   liApps that are pre-installed with OS X/li   /ul      Paths and applications that third-party apps and installers can write to include:      ul   licode/Applications/code/li   licode/Library/code/li   licode/usr/local/code/li   /ul   See Apple's developer documentation on System Integrity Protection for more details.
