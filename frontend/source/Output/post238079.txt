Connecting my Roll Up Piano via USB to record MIDI <body> I have a roll up piano (see the image) that has an USB output.     img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Qipxv.jpg" alt=""   An USB cable comes with it: it is able to connect the roll up piano with the computer.     img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6g5A9.jpg" alt=""   I have connected it to my macbook.  What are the steps to record MIDI on OSX using the roll up piano and the USB cable?

However, it is detected by the software:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fHYrh.png" alt=""  Is there any low-level way to test if the the machine gets data from the piano (e.g. a terminal command etc)? How to fix this problem? Should I install any drivers?  <answer238152> strikeIn the Ubuntu terminal, you can use codeamidi/code or codeaseqdump/code to monitor MIDI messages./strike  OS X has no command-line tool to monitor MIDI messages. You have to use some graphical tool like MIDI Monitor or MIDI-OX. You can also test it in the Audio/MIDI Setup windows with the "Test Setup" button; when you are playing something, the port icon (the triangle) should turn red.  To record MIDI data, use any MIDI sequencer. There is no reason why GarageBand should not work, but you could try Ardour instead.  <comment291846> What software is detecting the keyboard, GarageBand? Have you tried to set up the device using /Applications/Utilities/Audio MIDI Setup? <comment291854> Why are you mentioning Ubuntu? Are you running it on your MacBook? <comment291901> @IconDaemon Yes. Yes, I tried Audio MIDI Setup, and my device is listed there. I'm not sure how I can check if it's receiving data from the piano. <comment291902> @CL. Whoups, that was a mistake. I'm running Ubuntu on another machine. <comment355096> I guess my Roll Up Piano itself is kinda broken since it doesn't work on Ubuntu as well. My digital piano works fine. Thanks!
