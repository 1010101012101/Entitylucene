Bluetooth keyboard stopped working after upgrading to Yosemite <body> I've upgraded to OS X Yosemite and now my wireless bluetooth keyboard is not connecting anymore.  I have a bluetooth Belkin 10 keyboard.   <answer151397> I had the same issue. So I changed the batteries on the keyboard, turned the keyboard strongON/strong and then restarted the computer. It connected then.  I found that if the computer is dotted up and not the keyboard it won't connect. Hope this works.  <answer151505> I seem  to have fixed this now.    ol liI went into Bluetooth prefs and removed the mouse and Keyboard./li liI removed to batteries from both./li liRebooted./li liWent to System Preferences → Mouse/li liPut batteries back into mouse, re-paired strongmouse only/strong/li liRebooted./li liWent to System Preferences → Keyboard → Connect Bluetooth Keyboard./li liRe-paired keyboard./li /ol  <answer186669> Dave Meehan's technique worked for me:  ol liSwitch off the keyboard by holding down the power button for at least 3 seconds/li liClick the Bluetooth icon in the menu bar/li liClick on “Set Up Bluetooth Device” or “Open Bluetooth Preferences”/li liurn on the keyboard by holding down the power button, embut do not let go of the power button/em. It must be kept held down through the entire process./li liThe Setup Assistant will find the keyboard, so click the name of the keyboard, and then click on “Continue”. Make sure you are still holding the power button down./li liYou will be prompted for the Pairing Code. You can now release the power button, type the pairing code on the keyboard and then press return. There will be a slight delay whilst the pairing completes (a few seconds)/li liThe keyboard will now be Paired./li /ol  So just to clarify, the trick is to continually emhold down the power button/em.  <comment177989> Have you tried the standard - reboot bluetooth & computer, change batteries etc? <comment177992> I did, changed batteries, removed it from the Bluetooth listing and have been trying to re add to the bluetooth devices and it keeps telling me connection failed. <comment178542> Ive tried both replies to no avail, the 10Key belkin connects without issue and i have 2 apple keyboards, tried both and neither is connecting, it finds them, it just wont allow them to connect <comment178546> this did the trick:  http://davemeehan.com/technology/how-to-reset-an-apple-wireless-bluetooth-keyboard-mouse-or-trackpad
