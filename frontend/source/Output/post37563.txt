Tweetbot marks some tweets with a blue corner <body> Some tweets in my twitterfeed is marked with a blue upper right corner, and some kind of bookmark icon on it.  What does it mean?  <answer37565> It's a Tweet Marker feature.  it indicates your last read tweet.  When using another app that uses Tweet Marker, it will automatically scroll to that tweet so you know where you were.  <comment43415> Wow, a 'would love to have'-feature that I didn't realize that I already had. Thanks :-)
