Can I transfer backups when replacing a Time Capsule? <body> If I get a new Time Capsule, how can I transfer the backups from the old Time Capsule to the new one. I see an option to Archive the Time Capsule from the Airport Utility, but I don't see any way to restore. Do I have to go through the initial back up process again with all of my Macs?  <answer387> Some time ago I read an article about this procedure but it's a bit of a hack.  I won't copy it here because it's a 12-point tutorial.  Anyway, I was too lazy to test it, so I cannot guaranty it will work.  Maybe someone will post a better solution.  <answer530> If you can find a way to hook up the TImeCapsule's drive to your mac directly you might get away with this simple Disk Utility trick:  http://rolfje.com/2008/09/07/a-bigger-timemachine-without-changing-history/  <answer21680> From Apple Support Knowledge Base...  strongTime Capsule, Mac OS X v10.6.3 or later: How to transfer your back up from an existing Time Capsule to a new one/strong  For this process, you should leave your computer in the same room as the Time Capsules, or use one Ethernet cable to connect your Mac to the Ethernet port on the existing Time Capsule, then use another Ethernet cable to connect from the existing Time Capsule to the new Time Capsule.  ol liConfigure your Time Capsule for your network.

(they don't open easily or transparently) <comment23846> This can take a very, very long time - so gigabit ethernet cable is the way to go. This is the most secure / official manner since it's by-the-book <comment23892> Finally got my new Time Capsule and made the move last night. It was easy to copy the images over and took about 8 hours to complete (~1TB) on Fast Ethernet (100base-T). <comment24836> Like I said, "if you can find a way to hook up the TimeCapsule". Maybe there's also a way to do it just by mounting the sparse bundle, but I can't figure that out for you because I don't have a Time Capsule myself. Opening the Time Capsule would probably require a putty knife, like opening the mac mini. It's quite easy to open a mac mini actually.
