Unknown terminal 'xterm-256color' <body> Keep getting a message in Terminal saying   precodetput: unknown terminal "xterm-256color" /code/pre  This message typically appears when running codehomebrew/code, and while I can swear it's popped up on other places, I can't precisely remember. codeecho $TERM/code outputs codexterm-256color/code. I'm not the best at diagnosing Terminal problems, so any help is greatly appreciated.   (I know this may be an issue when SSHing to remote servers that don't support xterm-256color, but in this case I'm just concerned about my actual system.)  <answer26664> Nevermind, answered my own question. Stackoverflow had a post that I missed that described how the /usr/share/terminfo folder can get corrupted. Downloaded a replacement from that post, and the error message went away.  <comment30436> It would help if you could provide any information that might narrow down how this situation arose. Did you upgrade to Lion from Snow Leopard, for example? Did you install Xcode? <comment30579> I had upgraded Lion from Snow Leopard and installed Xcode, but did so well before this problem started. I did uninstall MacPorts and install Homebrew instead - that's the one "unix-y" think I can imagine that may have triggered the issue.
