Changeable desktop pictures <body> In changeable desktop pictures I use the pictures in iPhoto. Occasionally there shows a picture that I'd like to see in iPhoto. Is there a way to get the picture info while it shows as the desktop?  <answer47239> I'm afraid you can't. Your desktop just uses your iPhoto library to generate the background randomly.br So, the shown background is just a one-way link to the picture in your iPhoto library.
