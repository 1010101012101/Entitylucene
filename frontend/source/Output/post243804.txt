iPad 3rd gen won't turn on just black screen <body> I unplugged my iPad at 25% charge and used it. Suddenly my iPad froze at 19%.  I rebooted it by pressing both home and wake/sleep button. It was stuck on the booting-up screen so I decided to charge it. After plugging in my iPad for 30 minutes, I came back to check it but then it was turned off.  After that, I turned on my iPad but after the apple logo appears, the screen goes black.  I tried turning it on again but it just repeats the cycle. I already connected my iPad to iTunes to the PC to recover and restore it but still it won't turn on; it just keeps showing the Apple logo then black screen again.   What should I do? Does this need a reformat?  <answer243815> There are a couple of things you can try:  ul liTry doing a hard reset of your iPad.  Hold the sleep/wake and power buttons for 10 seconds until you get the Apple logo/li liAttempt "Recovery Mode".  With the iPad powered off, hold the home button and connect a USB cable from your Mac with iTunes.  Keep holding the home button until the Apple Logo appears/li /ul  Keep in mind, you will wipe your iPad and will have to do a restore.  <comment300340> Can you boot into DFU or Recovery mode?
