Sharing a provisioning profile among team members under a non-company subscription <body> Let's say there are two iOS developers using 4 computers in total, working on the same project. Because code signing information in the Xcode project file gets checked in to the source repo, and because they can't share the same provisioning profile, it becomes a headache for obvious reasons.  I know it's possible to use your own certs and prov. profiles on multiple computers, but is there a way to share at least the prov. profile (for development) between individuals without a company subscription?  Thanks.  <answer119695> Provisioning Profiles strongcan/strong be shared without problems between developers. For them to be valid and usable, though, having both strongPublic/strong and strongPrivate/strong keys is needed.  The strongPublic/strong key is stored emin/em the strongCertificate/strong whilst the strongPrivate/strong has to be exported from the certificate's creator strongKeychain App/strong.  <comment139594> For just development you don't need a profile at all. Only if you'd like to test on a real device or send out a beta version or launch the "real" version. <comment139622> OK but a cert is always a personal thing, so if I give away my cert to someone else, they can e.g. use to to sign god knows what on my name? Not that I'm expecting my partners to do it, but to understand the procedure. <comment139626> @mojuba Yes. Certificates are used as a security measure to ensure the App's integrity.
