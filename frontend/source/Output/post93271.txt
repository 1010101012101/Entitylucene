un-merge apple ID and icloud ID <body> So I had an xxxx@me.com ID for my iPod Touch and a xxxx@icloud.com ID for my iPhone. I was using both of them differently and separately. I was using the game center also separately for these 2 IDs. But recent somehow the 2 IDs are linked. I used a separate nickname for both IDs also but now somehow i cannot use the nickname for my xxxx@icloud.com and it shows that the said nickname is used by some other ID. Plus even though I log-in on my iPhone from the icloud ID, it somehow gets connected through the me.com ID. Let me know if someone can help me. Thanks in advance.  <comment109417> Unfortunately, I question whether this will be possible. Hop over to http://appleid.apple.com and log in with either your xx@iCloud.com or xx@me.com email addresses. Check out the email settings to see if it is possible to delete the other email address out. <comment109425> I think they were always the same, well on the email side there is only one address, that is all emails addressed to those two end up in the same place (also for me xxx@me.com is the same one) <comment109455> If the prefix (eg Steve@me.com and Steve@icloud.com) is the same, then they are bound to the same Apple ID. There is no such thing as an iCloud account and a Me account. iCloud is the new suffix and you cannot acquire a "me.com" anymore. Moreover, icloud.com has been issued to all existing accounts so you can use either.
