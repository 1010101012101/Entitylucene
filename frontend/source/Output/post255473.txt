iOS 10 Music App: "Add to up Next"? <body> The strongiOS 10 Music/strong app is revised and I had to get used to the new layout, thus investing emsome/em time in finding things.  However, I am pretty clueless on where to find the codeAdd to Up Next/code feature. There is the codePlay Next/code feature, but this doesn't allow me to add the selected song to the bottom of the queue. Using this on selected songs will essentially strongreverse/strong the order of selected songs.  Where can I find the codeAdd to Up Next/code feature on strongiOS 10 Music/strong app?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AuzIQ.png" alt="screenshot"  <answer255482> There appears to be a bug in the way the iOS 10 Music app handles this. However, there is a workaround that will get you by until Apple fixes it.  Take these steps:  ol liGo into the Up Next screen/li liTurn off the emShuffle/em function/li liCompletely close down the Music App (don't just exit)/li liLaunch the Music App again/li liUse 3D Touch (press firmly) on a song and select the emPlay Next/em option/li liNow use 3D Touch again, but on another song, and you'll see the emPlay Later/em option. /li liSelect emPlay Later/em to add that song to the bottom of your Up Next queue./li liNow the emPlay Later/em option will be there for all following songs./li /ol  However, the reason this is a workaround is that:  ul liyou no longer have the emShuffle/em function available to you./li liI'm not sure what the workaround is if you have a device without 3D Touch/li /ul  To have this whole issue fixed, send feedback to Apple.  <answer260838> I have an iPhone 6 and all I had to do was quit the app, add a song using Play Next, then I could add any songs I wanted using Play Later. I think the Play Later feature doesn't show if you just press on a song to play instantly, because I pressed on a song in my playlist and it adds all the other songs after it in that playlist into the Up Next list.   <comment318177> That option does not appear to be present in iOS 10. <comment318182> I don't use shuffle. But after using `Play Next` once, the option `Play Later` doesn't appear. <comment318187> Hmmm, pretty sure I didn't miss a step. Just confirming - at Step 3 did you completely exit the Music app by double-pressing the Home button and swiping up on the app? <comment318188> Interesting. I just turned shuffle on and **then** off. After step 3 and skipping step 5, it works. Must be a bug so we should expect it to get fixed. Until then, this is a great workaround! +1 <comment318189> Good to know, Hopefully this helps others out! Oh, and make sure you send Apple some feedback about this. <comment319516> 3D Touch? What is that? (iPhone SE user). <comment319523> 3D Touch is the process of _pressing firmly_ on the screen. This is not the typical _long press_ you're familiar with for Copy, Paste, etc. To familiarise yourself, do this test: On the Home screen, _long press_ on the Clock icon and you'll notice that it wiggles. Press the Home button to stop the wiggling. Now, _press firmly_ on the Clock icon. This triggers the 3D Touch and you'll actually feel the response and see some options. It's a bit like right-clicking with a mouse. 3D Touch can be used on many apps, both on the Home Screen (Settings etc) and within the apps (Mail etc) themselves.
