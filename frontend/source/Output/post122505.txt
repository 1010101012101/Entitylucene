iCloud Keychain search on iOS <body> Am I just not seeing a way to search my iCloud keychain when I go to (iOS) SettingsSafariPasswords &amp; AutoFillSaved Passwords ?  The list is very long and they don't even give me a way to navigate quickly down the alphabet. I'm hoping that if search emisn't/em currently available, they are going to add it soon.   <answer122506> In fact you are right, you can't search in that list on iOS.   Though you can give Apple some feedback and suggest them this particular feature.   <comment143174> Thanks, and done (again... though perhaps they don't remove duplicates if they are worded differently) <comment143324> This can be done if you're willing to jailbreak and learn SQL. <comment143408> @andrew-larsson No thanks.
