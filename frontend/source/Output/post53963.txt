how to force sync of calendars on iPhone? <body> I have various calendars from iCloud and Google and it's very often that an event will be deleted from Google calendar but the iPhone will still show it.  The same calendar is on iCal on my Mac and it shows it correctly there. If it doesn't, I can kbd⌘/kbd + kbdR/kbd or kbd⇧/kbd + kbd⌘/kbd + kbdR/kbd to update it.  Maybe I'm missing the place or configuration to do the same on the iPhone calendar application.  <answer53965> strongEDIT:/strong This has been fixed in recent versions of iOS. Please see @LukeWilliams answer which describes simply pulling to refresh the calendars in the calendars list.   hr  For deprecated versions of iOS: strongAs of iOS em5/em/strong there is no super easy/obvious way to do this. What I have found that works, is opening strongSettings/strong  strongMail, Contacts, and Calenders/strong  Tapping the email account you'd like to refresh  turn the calendar off  wait while it deletes it  turn the calendar back on.  hr  sometimes by forcing a New Event, it triggers syncing.  <answer61217> On iOS 6 or earlier, my experience is that the easiest way to sync the calendars is, from within the Calendar App on the iPhone, tap the Calendar Button in the upper left corner. You now have a display with a grey Edit button in the upper left, A blue Done button in the upper right, and down at the bottom on the left is a white clockwise circular arrow. Tap it and it will sync the calendars.  <answer125743> In iOS 7:  ol liOpen Calendar app/li liClick Calendars/li liDrag down to refresh/li /ol  <answer148428> I had this problem in iOS 8. For some reason, all the events from my work Gmail calendar disappeared. What I did was go into the settings then into mail contacts and calendars and then selected my work Gmail account. I turned off the calendar, then turned it back on. Then I went back to the calendar, and it started to sync. Hope that helps  <answer175276> I was able to refresh my google calendars on iOS 8 by clicking on "Calendars" on the bottom of the screen, then just swiping down, just like you would when refreshing your mail inbox.   <answer191222> If you open the iCal app on your phone, go to "Calendars" and swipe/pull down it will refresh it (you'll see the spinning circle thing). Refreshed and updated it right away.   <answer253851> I had this problem today and the solutions above did NOT work.    In my case the problem was I did not have calendars enabled for cellular data.  Since I wasn't on Wi-Fi, my calendar was not updating.    The solution was:  ol liGo to Settings  Cellular/li liMake sure Cellular Data toggle is turned on (shows green)./li liScroll down to Calendars &amp; Reminders.  Make sure toggle switch is turned on (shows green)./li /ol  That solved it for me!  <answer262372> What solved this for me was:  ol liTurn calendar sync off and back on again./li liRe-enter your Apple ID password in settings./li /ol  <comment82086> I don't know if this refresh button is supposed to refresh the calendars themselves, or just the list of calendars (what's on the same screen as that refresh button).  My iPhone stopped syncing my Google calendar completely -- updates stopped syncing in both directions -- and this refresh button didn't help. <comment82087> This worked for me; unfortunately it means losing any local modifications (on the phone that haven't been synced). So if the reason you need to force a sync is because you've made changes on the phone that haven't synced to the cloud, this trick won't help. <comment118680> Worked for me.  Had stale data (ie missing events from my corporate calendar), performed the above steps by Haiyaka, and the events showed up. <comment160782> Works exactly as described, and is entirely non-obvious. Thank you! <comment167713> Perfect, Thanks! <comment169594> Luke rocks, thanks! <comment182228> Worked on iOS 8.1 also, great! <comment186750> Didn't work for me on iOS 8.1.1 Used to work on iOS 7 though. <comment212370> when you turn it off would it delete all your calendar entries? <comment315966> Didn't work for me in iOS 10.0.1
