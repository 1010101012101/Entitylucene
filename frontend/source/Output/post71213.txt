Mac OSX: Finder stops displaying shared section <body> The finder in Mac OSX (Mountain Lion) suddenly stops showing the shared section. It might show up again in a couple of days or in might not. All completely spontaneous with no apparent cause. Any clues?  <comment82680> Is there anything to share available in your local network? <comment82683> 2 other macs and 2 windows systems all with file sharing enabled <comment82851> This could be related to the firewall. You need to set the `NetworkBrowserAgent` to allow all incoming connections. Have you done this?
