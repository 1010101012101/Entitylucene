How do I reinstall macOS to my Mac after formatting the main drive accidentally? <body> I recently installed Windows to my Mac and I have just formatted my hard drive on windows mistakenly while I was making a new hard drive partition on Windows. Now I cannot boot to macOS anymore.   How do I reinstall macOS to my Mac?  <answer287738> It isn't clear if you have one or two hard drives in your machine. Nevertheless, the only thing that comes to mind, if you can't access another Mac to make a bootable USB drive, is boot from Internet Recovery, and reinstall OSX.  To enter this mode Internet Boot Recovery, do the following:   ol liIn the Apple menu, choose Restart or power on your Mac. /li liAs the computer restarts, hold down the kbdcmd/⌘/kbd+kbdopt/⌥/kbd+kbdR/kbd combination immediately upon hearing the startup chime. Hold the keys until the animated globe appears on the screen./li /ol  From there follow the instructions and reinstall the original OS your Mac was delivered with. Then update to the latest macOS.  <answer287739> Are you able to get to recovery by holding command+R upon boot? you would be able to re-install there. Assuming probably not if the entire drive was formatted since it most likely would have blown out the recovery partition as well, but worth a quick check...  If not, you could create a bootable USB of your desired OS, boot to it, and install.
