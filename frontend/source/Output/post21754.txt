Installing Homebrew on Lion <body> I am trying to install Homebrew on Lion but keep getting an error.  precode$ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/gist/323731)" /code/pre  I run the above code, which results in:  precode==&gt; This script will install: /usr/local/bin/brew /usr/local/Library/Formula/... /usr/local/Library/Homebrew/...  Press enter to continue ==&gt; /usr/bin/sudo /bin/chmod o+w /usr/local ==&gt; Downloading and Installing Homebrew... bin/brew: Can't create 'bin/brew' tar: Error exit delayed from previous errors. Failed during: /bin/bash -o pipefail -c '/usr/bin/curl -sSfL https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/tarball/master | /usr/bin/tar xz -m --strip 1' ==&gt; /usr/bin/sudo /bin/chmod o-w /usr/local /code/pre  I have seen a couple of 'answers' to this problem which basically suggest running the initial command as root. This fails with the following error:  precode$ sudo /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/gist/323731)" Don't run this as root! /code/pre  Any suggestions would be appreciated!  <answer21774> Wow - there's not much that can go wrong with this - is your user an admin user on the mac? (the id command should show 80(admin) for your user when in the terminal)  That's about the only thing I can see that would prevent the script from calling sudo.  You should see it asking you for a prompt here:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UaI8r.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer21775> As per this question I ran the following command:  precodesudo chown -R `whoami` /usr/local /code/pre  And then re-ran the homebrew command:  precode$ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/gist/323731)" ==&gt; This script will install: /usr/local/bin/brew /usr/local/Library/Formula/... /usr/local/Library/Homebrew/...  Press enter to continue ==&gt; /usr/bin/sudo /bin/chmod o+w /usr/local ==&gt; Downloading and Installing Homebrew... ==&gt; /usr/bin/sudo /bin/chmod o-w /usr/local ==&gt; Installation successful! Now type: brew help /code/pre  I hope this helps someone in future!  <comment23924> Does it only output one sudo line after you press enter? It should chmod all the relevant directories there. <comment23925> "Homebrew": The missing package manager for OS X. "...the easiest... way to install the UNIX tools Apple didn't include. http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/ <comment23929> The outputs quoted in my question are verbatim. Nothing has been edited/missed out. @Wheat Williams - Thanks for the link but it doesn't help. <comment23931> Danny, I put the link in because I had no idea what "Homebrew" is and I had to look it up. I thought that other people who read this question would have the same problem, and since your initial question did not define what "Homebrew" is, it needed clarificaton. <comment23938> Ahh I see, good idea! I'll make a mental note to do that for future questions. <comment23952> Yep, it prompts for the password and then I enter it and it accepts the password and moves on. I'm not sure if I'm doing it right but the results of the 'id' command are here: https://gist.github.com/1144169 <comment23959> Ouch - your gist / id look fine. If you are comfortable with sudo - you might try again after `sudo -s` then `mv /usr/local /usr/bad_local; mkdir /usr/local; chown root:wheel /usr/local; chmod 0755 /usr/local` and trying again as your normal user. Somehow you don't have permissions to write into /usr/local (or somehow your path is really messed up and some basic commands are failing you)
