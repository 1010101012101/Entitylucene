How do I get to medications in Health.app? <body> In this MacWorld article it shows a screenshot of Health.app with a section for medications but I can't find it in my Health.app. Was this functionality moved or removed at some point?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/X5t12.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer240189> When you open the codeHealth/code app, look at the bottom row of tab choices.  On the far right you'll see one labeled emMedical ID/em:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MewIu.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Tap on that and you should see a screen similar to this image:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YnisM.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Tap emEdit/em on the top right (not shown in the picture above, I'm already in emEdit/em mode).  Go down to the emMedications/em section and enter whatever medicine you want in there.  <answer240623> You cannot track medications in the Health app in the way you're describing. HealthKit does not have any medication data types. It's possible those screenshots were from an early/preview version of the Health app, but that feature definitely didn't make it into any shipping versions of Health.  <comment295161> I guess you missed in the linked article in your OP where is says, "You will be able to create an emergency card, called the **Medical ID**, to the Health card. Your Medical ID is accessible from the Lock screen so it can be accessed in an emergency. Your medical ID Medical ID: Medical Conditions, Medical Note, Allergies and Reactions **and Medications**. ..." (bold text added by me) and it also shows a picture of it too which has the Edit link. I thought things were designed to be obvious... guess not. <comment295184> @user3439894 I'm looking to track medications over time like the rest of the options in the screen shot (besides the Me option). <comment295185> I'm looking to track medications over time like the rest of the options in the screen shot (besides the Me option). Was that an option before? I want to know what happened when "Medications" is tapped in my screenshot. <comment295232> No, you can't do that in the current iteration of the Health app. Try a third party app like this one: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/medisafe-medication-reminder/id573916946?mt=8
