Bind each keyboard layout to keys combination <body> There is a nice possibility to bind each keyboard layout to separate keys combination and switch between them.   So you can assign, for instance, shortcut Alt-Shift-0 to "Select English", Alt-Shift-1 to "Select German", Alt-Shift-2 to "Select Arabic".   How to make this on MacOS 10.7.4?  <answer61252> ol liGo to System Preferences  Language and Text  Input Sources./li liSelect whatever layouts you want in the sidebar./li liYou can switch between the layouts using the shortcut using command + [ or command + ]./li liIf you want to change the shortcut, go to the Keyboard preference pane  Keyboard Shortcuts  Keyboard and Text Input. /li liHere you can change the shortcuts for “Select the next input source” and “Select the previous input source”./li /ol  <answer61258> Hurray!

You mean Dvorak, qwerty, arabic and stuff? <comment70681> mm.. I mean U.S. English, Dvokar English, German, Arabic, etc. <comment70682> And I mean to switch between layouts <comment70685> This is not the answer to my question. My question not about shortcuts "Select next" and "Select previous". I'm asking how to create shortcuts "Select English", "Select German", "Select Arabic". <comment70687> Not possible. Nope. <comment70695> You are wrong :) <comment168869> @kim what do you mean by "add to sidebar" and can you explain the part with the 1st menu item etc....
