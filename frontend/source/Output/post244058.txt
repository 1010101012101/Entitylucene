homebrew - trouble upgrading openssl? <body> I'm on osx 10.11.  (Background: I'm having trouble getting the system installed Python to use TLS 1.1.)  From what I've read I need to use brew to manage Python.  But I want to upgrade openssl first so Python picks up the right version?  I did brew update, brew upgrade, brew doctor (no problems)  Then I tried:  precode$ brew install openssl Warning: openssl-1.0.2h_1 already installed $ brew link openssl --force Linking /usr/local/Cellar/openssl/1.0.2h_1...  Error: Could not symlink ../../../opt/openssl/include/openssl/aes.h /opt/openssl/include/openssl is not writable. $ brew link --force openssl Linking /usr/local/Cellar/openssl/1.0.2h_1... 1601 symlinks created /code/pre  I'm not sure if those worked on not, but here's where I am now:  precode$ openssl version OpenSSL 0.9.8zg 14 July 2015 $ which openssl /usr/local/bin/openssl $ ls -l /usr/local/bin/openssl lrwxr-xr-x  1 greg  admin  46 Jun 27 15:23 /usr/local/bin/openssl -&gt; /usr/local/Cellar/openssl/1.0.2h_1/bin/openssl $ /usr/local/Cellar/openssl/1.0.2h_1/bin/openssl version OpenSSL 1.0.2h  3 May 2016 /code/pre  So it seems like I might have installed the upgraded openssl version but am I ready to do brew install python and it will get the right openssl version and let me use TLS 1.1? (Is this even the right approach to get TLS 1.1 support for Python?)  <answer265024> solution to install from source and get around the homebrew error  precodebrew install openssl /code/pre  - Warning: openssl-1.0.2j already installed, it's just not linked.  precodebrew link openssl /code/pre  -Warning: Refusing to link: openssl Linking keg-only openssl means you may end up linking against the insecure, deprecated system OpenSSL while using the headers from Homebrew's openssl. Instead, pass the full include/library paths to your compiler e.g.:   -I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include -L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib  precodecd ~/scratch git clone git@github.com:openssl/openssl.git cd openssl sudo mkdir /usr/local/ssl sudo chmod 777 /usr/local/ssl ./config -I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include -L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib make make test make install /code/pre  now, you will think you failed. but per OpenSSL not getting linked with homebrew on El Capitan 10.11.6 you have to close your terminal then reopen it now   precodeopenssl version -a /code/pre  will show that you are using the new version.  <comment300731> Something is clearly wrong, you should get `OpenSSL 1.0.2h  3 May 2016` for `openssl version`.   What's the output of `command -V openssl`? <comment300792> Hmm, after a restart it all seems to be working properly.  Maybe there was something pointing to the old one somehow.  I'm thinking to install Python manually instead of using brew. <comment332253> Running `hash -r` (or just opening a new tab) may work better than restarting Terminal.app
