Shift + E doesn't work on my Mac <body> On the keyboard, shift + E will expand my window to the largest size.  I can't type capital E, unless I toggle caps lock.  I have BetterTouchTool, though the developer said it was unrelated.  <comment207441> Can you try disabling BTT? And creating a new user and see if it happens there as well? <comment207443> Long shot, but also check in System Prefs  Keyboard  Shortcuts  App Shortcuts that there is no command assigned to Shift/E <comment207481> Another long shot.  Do you have any Accessibility things set? <comment207736> 1) I'll try.2/3) No, but thanks for the suggestions
