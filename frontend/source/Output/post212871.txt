iMessage issue contacts <body> Why does my iMessage display, "other + (the number)  Example: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/g3fLr.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer212874> It is likely that either you do not have this phone number in your contacts so the default for an unknown number is strongother/strong or if you look at the phone number in your contacts for this person, you have the phone number set to other.   There are several descriptions, home, work, iPhone, etc. You are able to set these in contacts.
