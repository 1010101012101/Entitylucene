Where are the actions stored that the Contacts.app can apply on telephone numbers? <body> When I click on a telephone number in Contacts.app (or more precise: on the word left of it) I get to see the following menu:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/beRAY.png" alt="enter image description here"  Where does Contact.app store these actions? I couldn't find anything in the code/Library/Scripts/code or code~/Library/Scripts/code folder. I want to know this as I think the codeSend SMS with Bluetooth/code is not natively present and I want to copy this action over to a new install I'm going to do.  <answer136878> I found the install directory. Apparently it was the action posted here. The action is installed in code~/Library/Address Book Plug-Ins/code  <comment143664> Did you create the Send SMS via Bluetooth yourself? <comment143666> I sort of forgot... It's quite an old system. I guess so. It might be some plugin, but I can't find a plugin that bears that name. <comment143667> I think it's installed in the same folder as the Skype actions, so if I find those, I'll probably find the Bluetooth SMS as well. So where does Skype install these actions? <comment143671> No, don't think so. It involves clicking a bluetooth in the toolbar, but I have none (I don't even have a toolbar as Contacts on ML doesn't have one). I have a Nokia 6300 phone if that matters.
