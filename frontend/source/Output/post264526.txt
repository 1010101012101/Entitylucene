Profile Manager not sending email invitations <body> After installing a new copy of OSX Server I started the Profile Manager and wanted to add some users and enroll them for the VPP Managed Distribution (I am already registered for VPP).  In the VPP Managed Distribution section I hit "Resend invitation..." and a success message is displayed, but no invitation is received.  The possible causes:  ul liMissing SSL certificate/li liMisconfigured e-mail in OSX server/li liMisconfigured DNS/li /ul  I tried different email addresses and checked spam, but none of it helped.  Why are my invitations not sent?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tKxrJ.png" alt="Confirmation of invitation being sent"  <answer271430> ol liWhen you acquire VPP app licenses for free applications, are they appearing in your Apps tab in the Profile Manager [device manager interface] sidebar?/li liHave your devices successfully enrolled to Profile Manager, and can you deploy configuration payloads/profiles to them?/li /ol  We ran into this when getting OS X Server and PM up and running, and then realized you can distribute apps and books without requiring the user to approve these VPP invitations.   Unless you're attempting to deploy internal/enterprise apps, you can deploy App Store/VPP apps to devices or device groups as long as they are enrolled to Profile Manager (supervised or not, they should deliver as long as your config profiles are).  EDIT: You should also make sure that you have an APNs account and that APNs is enabled in your OS X Server, with an updated token.
