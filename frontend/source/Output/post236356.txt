Can I get iPhone's autocorrect to capitalize a multi-word name? <body> I live in a town called Port Orchard, and commonly type it out without thinking (that is, if I set a shortcut like "po", I forget to use it).  Since both port and orchard are common nouns, autocorrect leaves them alone, but I can't think of a sentence in which "orchard" would follow "port", except when naming the city.  Is it possible to make autocorrect change "port orchard" to "Port Orchard"?  <comment289252> If you don't want to add a shortcut, your options are limited.  One way that I've read about are to add Port Orchard as a name in your contacts.  Autocorrect will capitalize names in the Contacts app so you trick it into thinking the town is a proper name.  The other way I've read is to do a bunch of searches, in Safari, for Port Orchard.  Autocorrect accesses the Safari search history for words you've looked for.
