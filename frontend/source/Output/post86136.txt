OS X Mountain Lion does not updating <body> Now i am using codeOSX 10.8.2/code version and in app store it shows an update for OSX from code10.8.2/code to code10.8.3/code.. I tried to update OSX, but it showing an error like codeAn error occurred while downloading the updates.(102)/code.  Any help regarding this will be appreciated...  <answer86137> This happened to me last night. Close the App Store and Re-Open. Hit Update again next to the 10.8.3 description and it should start up again. This happens when your download connection drops out. The App Store application is actually just a web browsing frame which caches cookies with a delay for queries so it sometimes takes a minute to "refresh" itself to try again.  <answer86144> You can update manually using the 10.8.3 delta update from Apple.  <comment99369> yesterday itself i am trying like what you have mentioned... but the same error... even i tried after restarting the machine also the same result... <comment99370> try hitting update a few times... I think i pressed it 5-10 times before it fixed itself. You can also try logging out and back in to the app store <comment99752> If for some reason the delta update fails, try the combo update or post an update to the question with the error message from the installer log.
