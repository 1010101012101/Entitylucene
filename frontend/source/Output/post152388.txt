Cloudd quit unexpectedly <body> Ever since I upgraded to Yosemite, I have been experiencing codecloudd quit unexpectedly/code bug reports popping up at front very very often.  The issue is :   precodeCrashed Thread:        0  Dispatch queue: com.apple.main-thread  Exception Type:        EXC_CRASH (SIGABRT) Exception Codes:       0x0000000000000000, 0x0000000000000000  Application Specific Information: *** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSGenericException', reason: 'Error opening db at /Users/peter/Library/Caches/CloudKit/CloudKitMetadata: &lt;CKError 0x7f8bc1419590: "Internal Error" (1)&gt; (14/0x000e/unable to open database file)' terminating with uncaught exception of type NSException abort() called   Application Specific Backtrace 1: 0   CoreFoundation                      0x00007fff88a6464c __exceptionPreprocess + 172 1   libobjc.A.dylib                     0x00007fff89b036de objc_exception_throw + 43 2   CoreFoundation                      0x00007fff88a644fd +[NSException raise:format:] + 205 3   CloudKit                            0x00007fff83448a47 -[CKSQLite raise:] + 516 4   CloudKit                            0x00007fff834483b6 -[CKSQLite open] + 122 5   CloudKitDaemon                      0x000000010b523481 -[CKDMetadataCache init] + 199 6   CloudKitDaemon                      0x000000010b5233a0 __31+[CKDMetadataCache sharedCache]_block_invoke + 41 7   libdispatch.dylib                   0x00007fff88e1fc13 _dispatch_client_callout + 8 8   libdispatch.dylib                   0x00007fff88e1fb26 dispatch_once_f + 117 9   CloudKitDaemon                      0x000000010b523375 +[CKDMetadataCache sharedCache] + 46 10  cloudd                              0x000000010b37e541 cloudd + 5441 11  cloudd                              0x000000010b37e0e0 cloudd + 4320 12  cloudd                              0x000000010b37eace cloudd + 6862 13  libdyld.dylib                       0x00007fff85ebf5c9 start + 1 /code/pre  I do not know if this is relevant, but during 10.9 to 10.10 (yosemite) upgrade, I was asked to log in with my apple ID. I was connected to a WIFI provider (but not logged in) so I wasn't able to log in. The update did continue. On the first session I opened, iCloud kept crashing. I had a really hard time disabling iCloud drive.  <answer153645> The exception message says:  codeError opening db at /Users/peter/Library/Caches/CloudKit/CloudKitMetadata/code  Make sure that codecloudd/code has permissions to write in that directory. If the directories permissions are fine, maybe the db was corrupted during the update. Try to move the file somewhere else, it's possible codecloudd/code will recreate it if it doesn't see it.  <answer162094> Had the same issue with Yosemite. iMac14,2 / 3.5GHz Intel Quad Core i7/ 8G RAM / OSX10.10 / 3TB Fusion HD  cloudd.app continued to quit and I would get notifications of its quit.  Boot into SafeMode. Rebooted back into my adm. account. I get no more cloudd.app quits.  <comment179343> is your WiFi connection stable? <comment185127> It is not a permission issue, but rather a sandbox issue. <comment185128> It might not be a permission issue but nowhere in the stack trace I see any mention of sandboxd. Why do you say it's a sandbox issue ? <comment185132> You wouldn't see it in the stack. But I see the sandbox denying the access in the log. Plus, I tried giving unix + ACL permissions to everyone. Doesn't work. I tried copying a working database there (that I created using an other user on the MAC) : this time, I get a write error (the DB appears to be readonly). The sandbox is refusing write access to cloudd. <comment185200> I guess you're right @PeterG. I've a few problems too since Yosemite, please post a solution if you find one. <comment185613> I have a solution, but you won't like it. 1: Sign out of icloud. 2. Kill the user account on the computer. 3. Re-create it as admin. 4. Sign in icloud.  5. switch the account to regular user if you wish and fix perms. 6. Be certain not to have any sym links / alias in the path to your libary folder. <comment189406> Forget the safeboot mode. the issue still remains. <comment221785> If this doesn't solve the problem, please delete it. It will continue to attract down votes for being an entirely wrong answer to the question asked.
