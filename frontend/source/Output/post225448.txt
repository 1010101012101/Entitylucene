When I send email through Outlook on the Macbook, my font size is different when received in Outlook on PCs <body> When I send email through Outlook on the Macbook, my font size is different when received in Outlook on PCs.  For example, I send a message in font size 14, but when someone opens the message on a PC they see the message in font size 8.  The message appears to be fine in my sent folder.  Does anyone know why this is happening or whom I should try escalating this possible bug to?  The same happens with my other coworkers who use Mac in a PC-dominated office.  Thanks,  <comment273539> Is any other formatting lost as well?
