Is it possible to change the order of the tabs shown in the Dictionary? <body> In my Mac Mini running OS X 10.8, the tabs shown from Dictionary are the following:  ul liAll/li liAmerican English/li liAmerican English Thesaurus/li liApple/li liBritish English Thesaurus/li liWikipedia/li liBritish English/li /ul  I would like to change their order, as follows:  ul liAll/li liAmerican English/li liAmerican English Thesaurus/li liBritish English/li liBritish English Thesaurus/li liApple/li liWikipedia/li /ul  I tried dragging them, but nothing happens; I also tried selecting them pressing the control keys, but all I got was a contextual menu that allows me to edit the labels, which  is not what I want to do.  Is there any way to change the order that labels are shown?  <answer62556> Yes, just go to the Preferences for the Dictionary app.  There's a list there of all the possible dictionaries, which you can then drag to be in any order you like.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BcRWp.png" alt="enter image description here"
