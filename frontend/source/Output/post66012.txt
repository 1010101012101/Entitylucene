Can epoxy glue damage any of the iPhone surfaces? <body> I managed to drop my iPhone 4 an the black plastic rim has chipped off a tiny bit in places. I don't feel like paying for a full repair for a blemish, so I was thinking of just coating the dings with a thin layer of epoxy glue to cover the rough scratchy surface.  Could the epoxy damage the glass or the rim, or would this be okay to do?  <comment77672> You could end up with an iPhone smeared with epoxy glue. There just isn't a proper way to answer this question. If you feel comfortable with it, go for it. <comment77691> @Gerry Let's assume for the moment that I have the manual dexterity required to spread the amount of epoxy glue that I want on the specific spots I want. (Toothpicks work wonders.) What I'm asking is: will *the chemical properties of epoxy glue* cause either the plastic or glass or (unlikely) steel of the antenna to melt or corrode?
