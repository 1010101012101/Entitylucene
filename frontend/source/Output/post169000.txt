How in the world do you remove an action in iAd producer? <body> I am using iAd producer this afternoon to make iAds for some of my apps. I have googled around but I still cannot figure out how to remove an action that I have added to an action list. I have tried dragging the action out of the list, kbdcontrol/kbd clicking, kbdalt/kbd clicking, kbdcommand/kbd clicking, but I can't figure it out.  How do I delete the action?   <answer186040> Go up to the strongEdit Menu - Delete./strong
