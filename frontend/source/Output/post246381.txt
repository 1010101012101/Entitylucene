Why I cannot restore Apple TV from tvOS 10 preview? <body> It just shows error "The Apple TV software update center could not be contacted. The requested resource was not found." Is there anything I can do to fix it?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rXTuV.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer246382> It's a known bug. Download the IPSW manually from developer.apple.com/tvos/download, alt-click the Restore button and select your IPSW.
