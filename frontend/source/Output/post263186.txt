What com.apple.diskspaced service does? <body> What is the purpose of codecom.apple.diskspaced/code? What this service does exactly?  precode$ launchctl list com.apple.diskspaced {     "EnableTransactions" = true;     "LimitLoadToSessionType" = "Aqua";     "MachServices" = {         "com.apple.diskspaced" = mach-port-object;     };     "Label" = "com.apple.diskspaced";     "TimeOut" = 30;     "OnDemand" = true;     "LastExitStatus" = 9;     "PID" = 96227;     "Program" = "/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/StorageManagement.framework/Resources/diskspaced"; }; /code/pre  <answer264590> I think this service check your available  disk space.  If you have less than N% (~5%) of your HDD it will show a notification.  Until macOS Sierra this notification could be silenced by selecting (Don't show this again) but on macOS Sierra you no longer have this option.  I have 2% left on my HDD and I had to manually remove (Activity Monitor - Quit) this daemon so I don't get this annoying notification.  I have searched for a decent way to stop this notification but I think there is only this solution.  Hope this help.  <comment331616> I've already tried to do `launchctl stop com.apple.diskspaced`, but the notification didn't stop, so this service could be not responsible for the HDD notifications.
