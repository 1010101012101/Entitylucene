How to fix "xvinfo: Unable to open display /private/tmp/.../org.macosforge.xquartz:0" error? <body> I run codexvinfo/code and get  precodexvinfo:  Unable to open display /private/tmp/com.apple.launchd.D2FFj2I3es/org.macosforge.xquartz:0 /code/pre  I do not understand.

It has nothing to do with `xvid`. `xvid` is just a library for compressing and decompressing video and audio files. What is it you are trying to accomplish? From everything you've posted here it looks like xvid is installing successfully. <comment218260> Problem now solved! Fixing brew doctor's advices solved the problem. Still, however, I did not manage to solve the PATH issue. I have files .bashrc, .bash_profile and .profile where sourcing contents of .bashrc to .bash_profile if such a file exists (and it does). File .profile is nearly empty. <comment218266> @Masi Nope, not problem solved. `xvid` and `xvinfo` aren't related. :) Also, the polite thing to do if someone gives you a solution in a comment is to ask them to post their solution as a proper answer so they can get recognition for it. <comment218269> @IanC. Can do it if he wants. I did not want to bother him becaues he initially send it only as a comment. I deleted the answer. <comment218282> I would also remove /opt/local/sbin from your path as that is Macports and that and Homebre don't work easily together
