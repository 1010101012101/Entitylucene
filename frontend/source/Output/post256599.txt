Is there a way to check the completeness of a MacOS X installer download? <body> so the Sierra download I made last week was corrupted. it was obvious at first since I was able to create a USB installer and the USB stick boots fine. except that I was having issues proceeding in MacOS installation that after an hour of playing around, I got a message that says my USB installer was corrupt. I downloaded it again and now it's working fine.  When downloading Linux ISOs, most (perhaps all) distributions provided an MD5/SHA1 code so I can check my downloaded copy with those.  So is there way to check for the completeness of Mac AppStore downloads? I'm not so concern with small downloads but very concern with 1+GB ones.  Thank you.  <answer256604> From Apple KB: Mac OS X: How to verify a SHA-1 digestbr em[emphasis mine]/em     strongLearn how to verify a SHA-1 digest (also known as a checksum)./strong        Important: Verifying the SHA-1 of a software update is optional; it is   provided on Apple software updates for those individuals who want to   verify the authenticity of an update.      strongNote: For updates delivered by Automatic Software Update, SHA-1 digest verification is performed automatically for you./strong      To verify a manually-downloaded software update from Apple Downloads,   which contains a SHA-1 digest, perform the following steps:      ul   liOpen Terminal (located in /Applications/Utilities)./li   liType the following at the Terminal prompt:   codeopenssl sha1 [full path to file]/code/li   /ul   Which would appear to conclude that Apple doesn't maintain a public list of checksums for App Store versions.br However, there is an independent list maintained at https://github.com/drduh/macOS-Security-and-Privacy-Guide/blob/master/InstallESD_Hashes.csv for just the InstallESD components themselves.
