Tried to install gromacs 5.1.1 via homebrew, all commands are not found <body> I've tried to install gromacs on my system (10.11.5) via homebrew.  The command I used was codebrew install gromacs/code and it appears to have worked fine; gromacs is in my codeusr/bin/Cellar/code, and shows up when I run codebrew list/code.  But, when I try to actually run any gromacs command, I just get a command not found error.  When I try to run codeman gromacs/code it tells me there is no manual entry for gromacs; I get man entries as normal for other brew packages I'm using.  codebrew doctor/code output is pasted below, but nothing in there means anything to me.  I'd appreciate your perspectives on how to make this work, or on what other information I might need to include.    I wonder if I need to modify my PATH, but if so I don't know how to do that or what to modify it to.

The answer was that gromacs has changed since the version I used most recently, and the commands I was used to no longer exist.  For example, the codeg_energy/code command now runs as codegmx energy/code.  If you are also having this problem, codegmx help commands/code should give you a list of what the commands are now.  Thanks for reading this!
