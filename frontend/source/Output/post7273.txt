What port does Skype for iPhone use? <body> I want to set up Skype to have priority on my router whem I'm skyping from my iPhone, but I can't figure out which port the app uses.  Any ideas?  <answer7278> It seems that it's port 80 and port 443.  See this article on blocking of Skype 3G traffic  www.bluecoat.com/doc/486  <answer7285> Skype and firewalls     Ideally, outgoing TCP connections to   all ports (1.65535) should be opened.   This option results in Skype working   most reliably. This is only necessary   for your Skype connection to be able   to connect to the Skype network and   will not make your network any less   secure.   <comment7959> I always thought skype used any open port because it just works anywhere everytime, behind proxies and firewalls unless it's blocked for specific traffic or per application on its own machine.
