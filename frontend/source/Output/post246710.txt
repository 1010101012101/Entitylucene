Is there a way to combine two fullscreen windows into a split view window with Automator/AppleScript? <body> I'm currently making a workflow in which I need to combine two windows into a split view window (the feature from OS X El Capitan). I'd there any way to do that with AppleScript?  <comment370404> If you use the record feature and press and hold the green button to get split view, I can tell you from experience that all you'll do is get ordinary full screen. I haven't tried recording opening two windows in full screen, then going to mission control and dragging them onto each other - see if that does the trick. In AppleScript, the former would be telling System Events to either select full screen from the menu bar or to hit its keyboard shortcut, but I haven't played around with it long enough to see what it can do with Mission Control.
