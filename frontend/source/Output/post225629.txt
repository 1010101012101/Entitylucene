Different dock positions for multiple displays? <body> Usually, I have my dock on the left of my macbook screen. When I plug in to my big display I would like my left hand monitor to have a dock on the left of the screen and my right hand monitor to have a dock on the right. Otherwise I often have to move my mouse all the way to the opposite side of the opposite monitor just to open up my dock.  Is this possible?  I am running El Capitan if that is relevant.
