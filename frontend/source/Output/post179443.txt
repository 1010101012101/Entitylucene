Can I make my website respond to Apple voice dictation for navigation? <body> I'm learning about how to add accessibility into my website and want to include Apple voice dictation as a way to navigate the site.  Actually writing this question using voice dictation and hope that there is some way to navigate webpages without using my hands.  <answer179450> I'm not sure how accurate or the usability of this would be, but it might be possible. On your website you would need a few things.  ol liA textbox of some sort that one would be able to dictate the commands into/li liWhen the page loads, call the .focus() on the textbox, which will allow the user to call up dictation (Double press Fn) and tell you what they want to do./li liBind a jQuery .change() on this textbox, which would then parse what the user would have dictated in the textbox/li lijQuery action based on the command, whether it is a redirect, or scroll, etc./li liClear out the textbox and get ready for the next command/li /ol  There are some shortcomings, such as  ol liThe user will still have to initialize dictation in some way (Double press Fn) whenever a new page is loaded, unless you are loading everything through AJAX in div./li liWhere should the textbox be, and should it be visible to every user at all times?/li liTeaching your users the proper commands to use/li liWould this work on a Windows or Linux PC?/li /ol  It is definitely an interesting idea, but I don't think it has a very practical use, as there are many other accessibility programs on Mac such as VoiceOver that work very well. This is just a general overview, and there is a lot more complexity to it than shown above, especially when it comes to what commands do what and if you want to try and support natural language processing. I hope this helps!
