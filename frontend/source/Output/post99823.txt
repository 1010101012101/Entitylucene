Show all applications using keyboard shortcut <body> strongProblem:/strong  Show all installed applications in the /Applications folder using keyboard shortcut.  strongDesired solution:/strong  Potential utility/tool that runs in the background to show all applications upon keyboard shotcut. I know there has been a software that does this but do not remember the name.  Any suggestions?  <answer100196> As I understand the question, the shortcut is built-in to OSX:  ul liSwitch to Finder (clicking on the desktop is quick)/li likbdcmd/kbd+kbdshift/kbd+kbdA/kbd/li /ul  This brings up the Applications folder in the Finder. (Or were you asking for something else?)  <comment117475> See [Get a complete list of all applications installed](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/98826/how-to-get-a-complete-list-of-all-applications-installed) to understand why this is not as simple as it sounds (well, the keyboard shortcut is, but only if the base question is answered). <comment117477> OS X has an app that does this called [Launchpad](https://support.apple.com/kb/HT5548). Do you want something more? <comment117536> Finally found the application after hours of searching. It's called [Bevy](http://www.bergdesign.com/bevy/) and is available at the Mac App Store.
