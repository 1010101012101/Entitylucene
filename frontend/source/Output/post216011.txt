Finder "Always open with" ignored <body> On my Macbook Air (El Capitan) -   Why is it that when I select codeOpen With&gt;Other.../code   Enable codeall applications/code  check the checkbox codeAlways open with/code  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4PQ6R.png" alt="enter image description here"  It still makes me do it all over again,... every time!!!  I am trying to open xml files with Chrome.  But every time I select one from Finder and do open with...    If I just choose codeOpen/code then XCode opens it.    What does the codeAlways open with/code checkbox actually do? Is it for decoration only, and has no function?  It doesn't do what I think it should.  Please advise.  <answer216031> If you want to open all xml files in Chrome, you need to click the codeChange All.../code button in the codeFile | Get info/code (cmd+i) window.  <answer216094> What you're doing is making Finder always open this emspecific/em emfile/em with Chrome.   What you want is to open emall/em XML files with Chrome. To do this:  ol liRight click the XML file. /li liChoose Get Info/li liUnder "Open with", select Chrome and then click "Change All..."/li /ol  <comment261010> This happens when you SELECT "Chrome" from the all applications and THEN tick the 'Always open with" checkbox? <comment261011> @bjbk Yes and the order of events does not seem to matter either - whether I choose the app first and then check the box or the other way around. <comment261095> What does `Always open with` in the file open dialog mean then?  What's its usage? <comment261198> That only applies to that single file, not all files based on the file extension. Personally I never found this feature useful, since if I want to open a png file with GIMP for example, than I want to open all png files with gimp. Otherwise it is hard to expect what application will open when I double click on a file. <comment372704> Thank you! This is far from obvious in the "user friendly" Finder.
