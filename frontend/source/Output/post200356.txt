How to move files to pendrive (NTFS/FAT)? <body> I'm using Macbook (Yosemite) as my main computer right now, I'm downloading a lot of movies and whatnot from the internet on my Mac and I want to move them to my pendrive so I will be able to watch them on my Windows PC / TV.  The problem is I don't know how to move files from OS X so they will be recognized by other systems. I've been testing exFAT but it's not supported by most (all?) TVs. I've been looking for stuff like FREENTFS, but this doesn't work (even breaks) Yosemite.  <answer200429> FAT32 is generally a good choice as just about everything supports it. You emmay/em run into a problem with FAT32 though. It's maximum file size is 4GB, which might be an issue with some movie files, emand/em the maximum volume size is 32GB.  If those limitations are acceptable that would be my recommendation.  <comment241425> What is wrong with FAT32? <comment241774> I used to use FAT32 and ran into maximum file size problem, though I will use it again happily - everything is better than exFAT (I mean, I love the format, but almost nothing seems to support it as for today :().
