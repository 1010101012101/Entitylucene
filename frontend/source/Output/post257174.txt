Dictation inconsistency on macOS Sierra <body> I set up that thing where you can say "Hey Siri" using macOS Sierra and Siri will turn on yesterday. In short, this uses Dictation and uses "Hey" as the keyword phrase and "Siri" as an action to do the shortcut I have for Siri (‚å•Space, no hold). This works sometimes, but most of the time Dictation doesn't even recognize my "Hey". strongHow can I increase the consistency of Dictation?/strong  I should note that if it works, usually it keeps working until I reboot.  <comment321044> Where did you set up the hey siri? Also - what specifically do you want to solve. Please consider editing the question to have an explicit question at the end to increase the chances of getting an actionable answer.
