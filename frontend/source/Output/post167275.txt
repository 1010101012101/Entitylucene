Read GnuPG encrypted emails transperently on iOS <body> Are there any tools that integrate OpenPGP/GnuPG with the mail reader on iOS    I've heard that iPGMail and oPenGP, probably SecuMail too, all require that you copy &amp; paste an encrypted email into the application, which sounds obnoxious.  Any of these tools managed to actually integrate with iOS's mail reader the way GPGTools does on OS X yet?  Yes, I'm aware Apple's Mail readers support S/MIME, but that's less secure in practice.   <answer168259> Do you need to use Copy &amp; Paste with PGP/GPG mail?  No, that is not required.  For iPGMail:  ul liClick the encrypted attachment to open it - you see the encryptedbr text. /li liClick on the transfer button (at top right). /li liOpen in iPGMail./li liEnter your pgp password and see the unencrypted message./li /ul  Do any of the tools integrate like GPGTools on OS X?  This is impossible given Apple's sandboxing requirements.  As an aside this may well be a good thing as it avoids the annual scramble by GPG developers when Apple updates OS X and its Mail app.  <comment257924> Why do you say S/MIME is less secure in practice?
