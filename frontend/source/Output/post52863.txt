iPhone external speak with Bluetooth and AirPlay? <body> Most of the external speakers I've seen have either AirPlay [B&amp;W Zeppelin] or Bluetooth [Bose Soundlink, Jawbone Big Jambox] but not both.  Anyone know of an external speaker system that has both?  <answer52911> Samsung has announced some products that support both.  Have a look at the high-end Samsung Audio Dock DA-E750, and the (only) a bit cheaper DA-E670.  I have never listened to the Samsung speakers, but I do find them a bit expensive compared to the already 'premium' price of the B&amp;W Zeppelin Air for example, which still has a better reputation regarding audio quality, although preliminary reviews speak well about the quality of the Samsung speakers.  Also AirPlay is technically the superior technology, as it has a much larger bandwidth than Bluetooth, and transmits the audio uncompressed to the speaker. Unless you have specific reasons for needing Bluetooth, perhaps traveling with your speakers or streaming from non-Apple devices, I'd prefer an AirPlay speaker.
