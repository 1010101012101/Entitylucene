Can I group received emails in Sierra? <body> In Apple Mail v.10.3 (3273), is there a way to see received emails grouped together by sender name and subject as in Mail v.7 (running under Mavericks v.10.9.5) where I was able to click on the "#" (the number of emails in the group and 2 right-facing arrows) to expand or collapse the list? Thank you.
