How do I use <Ctrl+1> instead of <Ctrl+6> in VIM? <body> I have been searching for a while, but i still can't get it work.  I add code:map &lt;C-6&gt; &lt;C-1&gt;/code or code:map &lt;C-1&gt; &lt;C-6&gt;/code to '.vimrc', but it doesn't work.  <answer125246> If you use vim in iTerm 2, try to map control-1 to code0x1e/code (codeC-^/code).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6fgCp.png" alt=""  <comment147466> I add ':map c-1 0x1e' to '.vimrc', and it doesn't work.
