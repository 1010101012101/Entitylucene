How to delete one history entry in Safari on iOS? <body> On iOS, I have the history of Safari.   I want to delete some entries one by one. Is this possible ? I have tried going left â€” to no avail.  I have an iPad mini on iOS 7.  <answer178694> On iOS 8, I can delete an entry from the history by sliding left on it and clicking Delete.   This is a very nice addition. :-)   <comment199477> On iOS8 is possible if you swipe left. Can't test on iOS 7 device right now.
