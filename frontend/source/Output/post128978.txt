What email address do iCloud.com emails come from when you lose your password? <body> I have an iCloud account that I'm pretty sure will send to our mail server, and I have a way of seeing all the mail that passes to it, but I'm not certain what email account the username and password are being sent to.    So for this reason I'm asking what email address (probably appleid@id.apple.com) usernames and passwords are sent from when you reset your icloud.com account.  It would also be helpful if you could tell me the subject of the email.  Thanks!  <comment151131> What is the problem you are trying to solve here? Do you want to whitelist the address Apple sends these mails from in your mail server's spam filter? <comment151169> Well one of these was because my boss cleaned out the email accounts and the old email account no longer receive email; so when I ask icloud for the password it doesn't any anything on the icloud page about not being able to find the email address.
