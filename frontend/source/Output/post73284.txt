Sync multiple iPads via iCloud? <body> The company I work for has recently purchased a couple of iPads for the sales team and will be purchasing more over time.  We're tasked with the job of keeping all of our catalogues and video content up to date on the iPads and I wondered if it would be possible for all of the iPads to be synced on the same cloud account and push out the PDFs/Videos from one computer to keep it all up to date that way rather than having to manually connect each iPad when the sales team are in the office.  Unfortunately the ideal solution looks like it would have been the Apple configuration utility but we are running Windows based systems rather than Mac OS.
