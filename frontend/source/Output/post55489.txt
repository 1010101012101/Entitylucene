Exporting pictures from iOS device without using a computer <body> How can export pictures on an iOS device to an SD card or a USB memory stick without using a computer?  <answer55494> Since the iPhone and iPod Touch don't have an SD card port or the inherent ability to mount a USB memory stick, you'll need to purchase 3rd party hardware (and potentially software) to transfer data to either of these media types emwithout a computer/em.    A Google search on the subject could help. I can't make a product recommendation, but one place to start is with some reviews like this one at Wired's Gadget Lab  <comment63726> It's worth noting that the Camera Connection Kit is meant to import data *from* an SD card *onto* an iPad, not the other way around. As far as I know, it can't be used to offload pictures from the iPad. Or can it? <comment63728> @DanJ, no, it can't.  I've correct that error in the answer with an edit. <comment64255> @DanJ I haven't tried it myself, but I remember seeing a JailBreak package that enabled writing to the Camera Connection Kit *and* enabled reading (and writing) on more devices. I'm not sure what it's called, but I believe it's out there somewhere.
