How to mount VeraCrypt full disk encrypted volume in read write mode under macOS? <body> I am able to mount VeraCrypt full disk encrypted volume under macOS Sierra, but I am not able to write to it. The VeraCrypt disk shows read-only as false, but I don't have permission to write. The volume is formatted as NTFS. I tried with Paragon NTFS driver, the free version, but it does not work.  How to mount an NTFS volume as read-write?  <comment350328> Paragon's free version is only for Seagate drives. Is that what you have? <comment350329> Mine is buffalo. <comment350330> Then the free version won't work. <comment350331> Which format should I choose in veracrypt so that it works with macOS and Windows without additional software? <comment350332> I don't know the app at all, but ExFAT is the only large file-aware format that both can natively read & write <comment350333> Okay, thanks. Will try exFAT.
