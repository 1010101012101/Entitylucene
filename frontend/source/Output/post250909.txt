Disable password authentication for making inbound ssh connection only <body> I have set Remote Login to "on" for my Mac OS X so that I can ssh into it from somewhere else. For security reason, I want to disable password authentication and only allow public key authentication.  I have the following line in /etc/ssh/ssh_config:     PasswordAuthentication no   However, it also prevents me from login to other servers from my Mac using password authentication:  precode$ sftp username@some_host Permission denied (publickey,password). Connection closed /code/pre  I don't have permission to change settings on the codesome_host/code and have to use password authentication. How can I configure my ssh correctly so that it requires public key authentication for stronginbound connection only/strong, but not the other way around?  <answer250923> I think you want to edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config (not ssh_config).
