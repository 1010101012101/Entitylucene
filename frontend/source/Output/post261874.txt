iPod with SSD loads song files far slower than regular ipod <body> Two iPods= a 160GB 7th generation wi and a 5th generation customised with a 480GB SSD card. The 160GB loads songs via itunes many, really many times faster than the other. Is this normal ? Can the speed be limited by the dock of the 5th generation device (2005-made) ?
