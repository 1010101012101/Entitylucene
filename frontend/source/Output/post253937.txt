If I upgrade my phone then get a new phone number will my blocked list still stay on the phone? <body> I got a new phone and then changed the phone number but still have the same blocked list. Is this stored to iCloud?  <comment316099> @patrix Why was this closed? It's a pretty clear question with a simple answer? <comment316101> You already seem to have noticed that the block list remained the same after changing phone and contract, so it obviously seems to be stored somewhere. So do you want to know whether the block list is part of the backup (assuming you've restored the backup of your old phone onto the new), whether the block list is kept in iCloud "attached" to your AppleID (similar to the Keychain), or something else altogether?
