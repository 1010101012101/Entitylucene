Switching Organizations in Apple Developer Center <body> I have my own iOS Developer account and recently I got invited to join a team. I accepted, but now I can't switch back to my personal account to develop apps for myself. Every time I log in it has the Organization set to that team.  How can I switch back to my own developer center area??  <answer93936> You will need two Apple ID to have distinct roles within Xcode and within the developer portal.  I would get in contact with Developer Support before making a new account to be sure you have all the steps correct as well as have them verify what you think has happened to your current account. It's better to get confirmation before making changes in my experience.  ul lihttps://developer.apple.com/support/technical//li /ul  <answer93971> I have an Apple ID for my multiple work accounts.  When I sign in, I see:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nICsO.png" alt="Team Select Screen"  I'm not sure why you aren't seeing it, if you have two teams on the same Apple ID.  <answer214220> As the solution suggested by Alan does no longer work for me, I investigated a bit and found out the team switching option is now located under emCertificates, Identifiers &amp; Profiles/em, but still has no clickable link to it.  The URL is now:br https://developer.apple.com/account/selectTeam.action  strongUpdate/strongbr It appears, the following URL is also working: https://developer.apple.com/membercenter/selectTeam.action  <answer218826> The link  that max shared is valid but I was wondering how to get the team switching option without knowing the url.  I found that for now on, Apple needs you to logout from the Member Center and then when you log back in, you see a switching option before the dashboard.  <comment127102> I don't see how to get to this page other than manually typing the URL, but it does work! (assuming you're in multiple teams) https://developer.apple.com/devcenter/selectTeam.action
