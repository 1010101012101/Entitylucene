VMware Fusion 8 with Ubuntu Guest - Numbers appearing as weird ASCII characters <body> I have VMware fusion 8.5.6 with an Ubuntu guest. Numbers are appearing as diamonds and other ASCII characters, where they were working fine before. I've checked the keyboard profile and it is set to Mac.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zQtjJ.png" alt="enter image description here"  This is not an issue on my Windows VMs.  <comment354736> When I hold down the right alt key, it works.
