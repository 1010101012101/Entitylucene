Numbers never responds <body> When I try to run Numbers, it bounces for a while, and then just stops. No windows, no menu bar, nothing. When I Ctrl-click the icon, it says not responding, so I force-quit.   I have never actually succeeded in running Numbers. Do I need to delete and re-install?  <comment168513> Trying monitoring Console.app for error messages while attempting to start Numbers -- paste your Console.app output here. It will help debug the issue. <comment168515> Welcome to AskDifferent! I suggest you add more information to your question to make diagnosis easier. Please edit your question to include the type of Mac, the version of Mac OS X running on it, and the version number of Numbers that is causing the problem. Does the same thing happen to Pages and Keynote, the other iWork apps in the suite?
