MacOS Server DHCP lease duration change <body> Running MacOS Server 5.2 on El Capitan. I'd like to change the DHCP server's lease duration.  I'd like to use 8 hours but the GUI only gives me a choice of 1 hour, or 1 Day, or higher.  Can anyone help me with a terminal command to achieve this please?  I've found codesudo serveradmin settings dhcp | grep lease/code which lets me see DHCP settings, but I just cannot work out how to change the lease period.  <answer269756> First enter - to get an overview and the appropriate array_idUUID:  precodesudo serveradmin settings dhcp /code/pre  Then (with the proper array_idUUID)  precodesudo serveradmin settings dhcp:subnets:_array_id:array_idUUID:lease_max = 28800 /code/pre  Example:  precodesudo serveradmin settings dhcp:subnets:_array_id:A387646D-BBC1-88CD-993E-2D36E15C5089:lease_max = 28800 /code/pre  Then restart the DHCP service:  precodesudo serveradmin stop dhcp sudo serveradmin start dhcp /code/pre  Check the new settings with codesudo serveradmin settings dhcp/code  <comment338897> Thanks klanomath, that's exactly what I needed.  Afterwards - the check reflected the change within terminal.app and the GUI also reflected it.  Many thanks!
