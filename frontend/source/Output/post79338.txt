Remote app doesn't work <body> After I key in the code for pairing the remote app on iTunes, the app just shows "Looking for ..." for a long while, then says "could not find".   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uai4E.jpg" alt="remote app fail"  After that, the library seems to appear on the library screen of the remote app, but it doesn't have a name! There's an icon with no label below...  Pretty odd. Googling shows that many others are having similar issues, but no one seems to have a solution.  I've also tried to use "home sharing" to use the app, also doesn't work.  Any suggestions on how to solve this?  <answer169122> I got the same issue with iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite still.  I fixed this by simply changing the computer name of my mac running iTunes!  Go on your Mac to System Preferences - Sharing and change the computer name.  Now the iTunes Library appears properly with Home Sharing and also by the 4 digit code.  Very strange, though.
