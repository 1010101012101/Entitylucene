How to display the MiniPlayer in iTunes with AppleScript? <body> I use an Automator workflow to open iTunes at startup, etc.  I'd like it to open the MiniPlayer window. I don't see a function to do that in Automator.  How could I do this with an AppleScript script?  <answer113947> AFAIK you can only do this using UI scripting, here are some ways to switch to the miniplayer :   Simulating a click on the button in the interface :   precodetell application "System Events" to tell process "iTunes"     click button 4 of window 1 end tell /code/pre  Using the keyboard shortcut :   precodetell application "System Events"     tell application "iTunes" to activate     keystroke "m" using {option down, command down} end tell /code/pre  hr  If you want to display the miniplay AND the fullsize player (your request isn't clear) use :   precodetell application "System Events"     tell application "iTunes" to activate     keystroke "3" using {option down, command down} end tell /code/pre  <answer113950> You can also do it by scripting the click of the menu item:  precodetell application "System Events"     tell process "iTunes"         tell menu bar 1             tell menu bar item "Window"                 tell menu "Window"                     click menu item "Switch to MiniPlayer"                 end tell             end tell         end tell     end tell end tell /code/pre  â€¦but it's still not a 'proper' method though :(  <comment133597> It also has the downside that I won't work on a non-english OSX. That's why I didn't suggest it.
