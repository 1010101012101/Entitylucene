How to prevent warnings like No xauth data when doing ssh from OS X to other machines? <body> I get codeWarning: No xauth data; using fake authentication data for X11 forwarding./code when I do ssh to other machines from my OS X machine which has X-server installed.  codeecho $DISPLAY/code returns something like code/tmp/launch-4eEyr6/org.macosforge.xquartz:0/code  Inside code~/.ssh/config/code I specified codeXAuthLocation xauth/code but I still get the errors.  If I replace the line with full path to xauth (code/opt/X11/bin/xauth/code), I stop getting the errors but the problem is that I do share the ssh config file between several machines, so I cannot put a path that is specific to Mac on it.  I would prefer a solution that would not require me to create a symlink on Mac from code/opt/X11/bin/xauth/code to code/usr/bin/xauth/code.  <answer63227> I see it's an old question but for the sake of Google, here is my answer.  On the Mac, you can create an alias in ~/.bashrc like so:  precodealias ssh='ssh -o "XAuthLocation=/opt/X11/bin/xauth"' /code/pre  If you also share the .bashrc across both OS X and other unixy machines, you could add a little stanza to the .bashrc as follows:  precodeif [ `uname` == 'Darwin' ]; then     alias ssh='ssh -o "XAuthLocation=/opt/X11/bin/xauth"' fi /code/pre  <comment324384> I'd like to add that you can edit the /etc/ssh/ssh_config file on the individual machines to add the XAuthLocation information that applies to that particular machine.
