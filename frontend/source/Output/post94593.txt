What is the correct way to take screenshot for the Mac App Store Submission? <body> I wanna submit my app to the mac app store. Mac App Store is asking for the screenshot of the dimensions 1280x800, 1440x900, 2880x1800 or 2560x1600. My samsung display does not support this dimensions. If I take the screenshot using Grab and scale it to the 1280x800 dimension it is not looking great. What is the correct way to take the screen for the MAS submission?  PS: My Samsung Supported dimensions: 640x480,720x576,800x600,1024x576,1024x768,1280x960,1344x756,1344x1008,1600x900  <answer175923> See the docs — in the last row of the table it says:     One screenshot is required for Mac apps.   Up to four additional screenshots can be uploaded. Screenshots appear on the store in the order they were uploaded in iTunes Connect.   Screenshot requirements are:      ul   li72 dpi, RGB, flattened, no transparency/li   liHigh-quality JPEG or PNG image file format in the RGB color space/li   li16:10 aspect ratio/li   liOne of the following sizes:   ul   li1280 x 800 pixels/li   li1440 x 900 pixels/li   li2880 x 1800 pixels/li   /ul/li   /ul   <comment110887> Save the screen shot file as PDF. <comment110888> Use the 1280×960 resolution and just size the window appropriately for a 1280×800 shot? Similar for larger ones? <comment358167> The question is how to make screenshot if the display does not support any of the required sizes, not what the required sizes are.
