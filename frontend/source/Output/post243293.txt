OS X how to disable Command P Shortcut <body> I would like to disable Command P shortcuts or change it to something i would not accidentally hit  But i do not see options in Settings  Keyboard  Shortcuts  Regards  <answer243294> Keyboard shortcuts such as the "Print Document" shortcut are baked into the each application, so unfortunately it isn't something that is system-wide and can be disabled in one place.
