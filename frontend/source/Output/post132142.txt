How can I get a OSX mountain lion installer for deployment testing? <body> I have a macmini which came with Mountain Lion preinstalled as from factory. I need to create a virtual machine on this macmini (OSX host/OSX guest) with the same version for end-user deployment testing. I went to the apple store to get the installer, but I can only get mavericks, and I want to test deployment on 10.8. How can I get a ML installer so I can use vmware or virtualbox to install osx in the virtual image?  <answer132145> You can purchase Mountain Lion from the Apple Store.  ul lihttp://store.apple.com/us/product/D6377Z/A/os-x-mountain-lion/li /ul  This gives you a code which lets you redeem Moutain Lion from the Mac App Store and download the installer.  <answer132146> Developers registered with Apple's Mac Developer Program can download older editions of Mac OS X for development and testing purposes.  The screenshot below shows OS X Mountain Lion is still available to developers.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/s5bP5.png" alt="Mac downloads from Apple"  <comment208387> This won't work in Yosemite - I get the following error: http://i.stack.imgur.com/e3aab.png <comment208442> @nathan-osman please can you open a new question.
