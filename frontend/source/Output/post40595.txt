MacBook Pro issues at login screen when sleeping / logging in <body> Despite having auto login disabled and FileVault turned on, when sometimes logging into my mac (after sleeping) I get this happening (I've blocked out some personal info):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZgfVh.png" alt="enter image description here"  This then causes my mac to beach ball and lock up, at which point I have to hard reboot.  Anyone have any ideas?
