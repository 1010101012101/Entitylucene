Turn off accented characters <body> When I type code'/code then codeA/code , it types codeÁ/code, instead of simply code'A/code . How to disable this feature. It's a pain while programming, as we need to type things like code'example string'/code a lot.   <answer228380> If you use the proper keyboard layout this won't happen. Proper keyboard layouts are US-english, US-english extended (or ABC Extended in El Capitan) or UK-english.  code'/code is a single quote while ` or ´ are accents. The single quote will only yield an codeÁ/code if you have the US International PC keyboard layout active.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cIuYf.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment278439> What language keyboard & OS? Doesn't do that on UK English. <comment278440> El Capitan and US Keyboard <comment278442> I figured out the problem. Actually I had set the keyboard to US international instead of US. Now it's working fine.
