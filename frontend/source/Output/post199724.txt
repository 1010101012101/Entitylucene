How to recover a deleted folder from Time Machine back-up disk? <body> I wanted to clean my external disk that I use to back up my mac, but I didn't do it right... I deleted the folder 'Mac's Name' with my back ups, but the weird thing is that there is no extra free space on my external disk. So I learned that you have to delete your back-up within the Time Machine Interface. But I can't recover this folder from the trash can because of this message: "The operation can’t be completed because backup items can’t be modified."  <answer199797> If you haven't emptied the trashcan, then you can manually move the files back from the code/Volumes/&lt;diskname&gt;/.Trashes/code directory inside a terminal window  strongNote/strong: You need to be root, so first codesudo su -/code and then cd into the .Trashes directory, and use codemv * ../code should move and make them available again  <comment240766> I solved it myself with this forum post: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5198466 Apparently Apple suggest not to use terminal to remove or reset time machine backups...
