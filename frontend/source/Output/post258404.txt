How to rid of this icon on my lock screen? <body> I have the Pokémon Go app displayed on my lock screen and on this other screen. Is there any way of removing the icon from the lock screen?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Q0wwU.png" width="320" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nU3US.jpg" width="320"  <answer258408> Go to strongSettings/strong → strongGeneral/strong → strongHandoff &amp; Suggested Apps/strong and disable strongInstalled Apps/strong under Suggested Apps. This removes suggested apps from both the Lock screen and app switcher — it's not possible to disable one without the other.  <comment323027> Where is the suggested app? I see the hands off but not the suggested apps <comment323048> @Megz Both suggested apps and handoff appear in the same location—the bottom-left of the lock screen or at the bottom of the task switcher. In this case, Pokémon Go is appearing as a suggested app (as it mentions in the task switcher view, it's suggested due to the user's current location).
