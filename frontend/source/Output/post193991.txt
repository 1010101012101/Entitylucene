iCloud storage full: "Not Enough Storage". Backups exceed 5GB <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Aoq8Km.png" alt="Not enough storage"  Just like everyone else, I get the notification that my iCloud is full and no backup can be made. iOS gives me the suggestion to upgrade my storage on my iCloud account. Because I only want to store my settings, phone numbers and other 'light' stuff, I see no reason to upgrade. I think a few gigabytes should be more than plenty to backup my device(s).  What is taking all the space on my iCloud?  h3First I checked on my Mac - OS X Mavericks/h3  On OS X I have checked the following in 'System Preferences' - 'iCloud':  ul liBackup 4.44 GB/li liDocuments 550.7 MB/li liMail 5 MB/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rnPd0.png" alt="System Settings iCloud"  Okay, my major storage exists of the type 'Backup'. I Guess these are the backups from my iPad and iPhone, but System prefs gives me no further clue. Lets look at my iPhone  h3I got out my iPhone - iOS 8.4/h3  I go to 'Settings' - 'iCloud':  ul liiCloud Drive emON/em/li liPhotos emON/em  ul liiCloud Photo Library emOFF/em/li liMy Photo Stream emOFF/em/li liiCloud Photo Sharing emON/em/li /ul/li liMail emOFF/em/li liContacts, Calendars, Reminders, Safari, Notes, Passbook emON/em/li liBackup, Keychain, Find My iPhone emON/em/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/z1Fepm.png" alt="iCloud settings"  Then I go to 'Settings' - 'iCloud' - 'Storage':  ul liTotal storage 5.0 GB/li liAvailable 15.9 MB/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vrfGhm.png" alt="iCloud Storage"  I go to 'Settings' - 'iCloud' - 'Storage' - 'Manage Storage':     LAST BACKUP FAILED      An additional 5 GB of storage is required. To   continue backing up this iPhone do one of the following:      ul   liChange your backup options/li   liDelete some data/li   liBuy more storage/li   /ul   Also, it gives me the following use of my data:  Backups:  ul liiPhone backup of 4.3 GB/li liiPad backup of 137.4 MB/li /ul  Documents &amp; Data:  ul liSome documents with a total of 534.6 MB/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hKG6Lm.png" alt="full"  Okay, so all my storage goes to 'Backups'. Lets select the iPhone backup (and here is where I get lost...)  'Settings' - 'iCloud' - 'Storage' - 'Manage Storage' - 'iPhone Backup':     BACKUP OPTIONS      Choose the data you want to back up.   An additional 5.0GB is required to back up   this iPhone   Next Backup Size 5.0 GB ⚠️  ul liPhoto Library 2.3 GB emOFF/em/li liWhatsApp 550 MB emOFF/em/li liKeynote 238 MB emOFF/em/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xGSVdm.png" alt="What is taking space?"  There is no space requiring stuff to backup and still is it taking 5.0GB... What does my phone want to backup that takes 5.0 GB of space? Is there a way to visualise this? I only want to backup some settings and contacts, no major stuff...  How can I backup my stuff with the default 5 GB?  <answer194583> strongMy answer is based on My personal experience, so this may or may not be valid for you./strong  Based on the information provided by you, it reminded me of a similar situation I had face sometime back. iCloud not back's up the recent backup data but also saves the backup files backed up before, As in, If I created a backup today, and then I created a backup next week, it's going to keep both the data as I might want to go to the lower backed up version in case you want to restore from not the most recent version of the backup. It looks something like the image below.   That's what is clogging the space in your backup.  P.S: This Link will explain how to restore to the not so recent backup proving my point as well.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/D82rP.jpg" alt="enter image description here"   <answer194585> What to do when you do not have enough storage because your backup size is too large:  ul liDelete the current backup on your iCloud for emthat specific/em iOS device./li liYour iCloud backup is now automatically turned off, so turn it back on./li liA new backup is made and has a reasonable size./li /ul  emTheoretically your phone could crash in the short while you do not have a backup, so you could run an iTunes backup first./em  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ePVudm.png" alt="storage"  <answer202714> I was suffering from the same messages/issues as you? My iCloud back up contained all the apps that I have ever installed. I turned off the ones that had no importance to save and checked my storage, it showed that I had 4.5kb!  <comment231311> Why not back it up to iTunes? It wouldn't need any extra space in the cloud. <comment231313> @bret7600 Thats what I do know, but that is not the question. <comment231327> Have you deleted your messages? <comment231375> 1st pic shows Photos backing up, but last pic doesn't - did something change, or is the issue in there somewhere? Sometimes rebooting or logging out of iCloud & back in will shake down old storage requirements. <comment231386> @pjtnt11, I've just deleted all my messages, but the backup size is still 5GB <comment231388> @Tetsujin, the Photos switch is ON (on OS X and iOS) for following Photostreams only, Photos are not backed-up via iCloud. <comment232138> This is exactly what I did yesterday. Deleted my previous backup and started from zero. My Backup size is now 378.8 MB, around the size what I expected it to be. As it is the correct answer, you made and easy 200+ ;)
