Mac Pro ATI 5770 with 3 monitors - what active adapters needed? <body> I just bought a Mac Pro 2010 with an ATI5770 that has 2 x Mini Display Port (DP) and 1 x DVI.  The current configuration is as follows:  ul liMini DP A  passive HDMI adapter  1920 LCD/li liMini DP B  passive HDMI adapter  1920 LCD/li liDVI  passive DVI to HDMI adapter  1920 LCD/li /ul  In this configuration, strongonly two out of the three monitors will work at any given time/strong.  From reading up on the topic, I understand that I'll need at least one strongactive adapter/strong in order to get all three monitors going together.  strongWhat is the minimal number of active adapters I need?/strong i.e. do I need one or two, and on which port(s)? If that matters.  A recommendation for suitable non-Apple adapters would also be appreciated.  <answer192705> Confirmed: for this to work you need two (not just one) emactive/em adapters on the Mini DisplayPorts.  When shopping around, the adapters may also be referred to as codeEyefinity/code compatible.  You don't emhave/em to buy genuine adapters - I am using two of the cheaper ones.  <comment228168> Does this answer your question – [How to get 3 1900x1200 monitors working on a 2010 Mac Pro](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/56276/how-to-get-3-1900x1200-monitors-working-on-a-2010-mac-pro?rq=1) ? <comment228172> I read that before, but I had to read it again to really follow.  So I need 2 x Active Mini DP to HDMI adapters? <comment228175> I only have [two displays connected to my Mac Pro](http://theworklife.com/graham-miln/2013/07/09/fixing-mac-kernel-panic-ati-5770-and-nvidia-gt120-graphics-cards/). Hopefully someone with three displays will be along soon to provide an definite answer; otherwise a trip to an Apple Store Genius might be wise. <comment228184> well I just ordered 2 x active Mini DP adapters - so I can let you know on Friday ;) <comment228185> Please do formally answer and close this question when you know. I hope they work!
