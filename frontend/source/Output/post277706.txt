How can I append to a file using dd? <body> On Linux systems, I can append to a system file like this:  precodeecho "# New data" | sudo dd of=/etc/config_file conv=notrunc oflag=append /code/pre  But the dd command under OS X doesn't have the codeoflag/code option. Is this possible under OS X?  Notes:  ol liI need root access./li liI'm not asking for alternative solutions, I'm asking if dd has the capability./li /ol  <answer277724> Is there any reason you are using codedd/code rather than output redirection?  The following will work:  precodeecho "# New data" &gt;&gt; /etc/config_file /code/pre  The code&gt;&gt;/code means add to the end of file if it exists, otherwise create a new file.  <answer277725> I also tried what you mention above , sadly it is not appending the output file as expected. But you can do below method,  strongFirst Create temporary file and later use dd command/strong  strongCreate/strong a strongtemp_file/strong and strongredirect/strong all data/output you want to write to that file and later you can do  precodesudo dd if=/temp_file_path of=/etc/config_file conv=notrunc /code/pre  <answer277993> You can codeseek/code to the end of the target file:  precodesudo echo "# New data" |     dd of=/etc/config_file conv=notrunc bs=1 seek=$(stat -f "%z" /etc/config_file) /code/pre  <comment349801> Note `sudo` for root access. <comment349831> Just add `sudo` in front of the whole line shown. <comment349834> Nope, that won't work, either. In any case, I can come up with alternatives. The question is specifically about dd. <comment349836> Install brew and brew/coreutils which provide (GNU) dd - linked as gdd to /usr/local/bin.
