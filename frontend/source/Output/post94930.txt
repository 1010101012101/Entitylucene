Difference between enabling Time Machine's "Encrypt Backups" option, and encrypting from Disk Utility? <body> I'm setting up Time Machine backups on a new external hard disk.  I chose to first encrypt the disk via Disk Utility:br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WzqQ3.png" width="622"  But I also see these options: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vPUPf.png" width="488"  strongIs there any difference/strong between an "Encrypted" format via Disk Utility and selecting "Encrypt backups" in the Time Machine preferences? What happens if I do both? Or if I encrypt with Disk Utility, but then emdon't/em select "Encrypt backups"?  <answer95115> Aha! The answer comes when you try to strongdeselect/strong the "Encrypt backups" option:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/thVPN.png" width="432"  So it appears they are one and the same.  <answer255953> The command:  precodediskutil list my_time_machine_disk_short_name /code/pre  will confirm you:  precode#   my_mac:/Users/bob  % diskutil list disk5 /dev/disk5    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                 Apple_HFSX Time_M___disk          *499.4 GB   disk5                                  Logical Volume on disk2s2                                  22222222-FFFF-4444-CCCC-AAAABBBBCCCCDDDD                                  Unlocked Encrypted #   my_mac:/Users/bob  %  /code/pre  that codeTime Machine/code is using the same technic of logical volume as codeDisk Utility/code.  <comment318995> Could you clarify that you got this question on a disk encrypted with `Disk Utility` and not from `Time Machine`?
