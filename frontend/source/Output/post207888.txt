What does a non-booting macbook displaying a lightning bolt mean? <body> I returned to my MacBook after a few days of not using it, and there was a message that the system had run out of application memory (weird...). So, I followed the recommendation and Force Quit a bunch of applications. In order to just "start fresh", I decided to kill all applications and simply restart the whole machine.  Now that I've killed the applications and restarted the computer, it won't boot. It simply displays a gray circle with a white lightning bolt on it, moving around the screen, screensaver-style. If I unplug the AC power cord, a battery indicator is displayed at the bottom of the screen.  I attempted an SMC reset, but that doesn't help. What's going on, and what should I do?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hROWe.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer207892> NVRAM holds the info on where/how to boot (Target Disk Mode). You need to reset the NVRAM  <answer207894> That looks like the Thunderbolt logo. Your Mac probably thinks that is in Target Disk Mode.  <answer248894> Watch on the right of your mac, on top it has the same symbol as the logo you are showing. It is probably a cable that needs to be plugged in. If you think this means trouble go to your local apple store.  <answer261579> Thanks everyone! I got this after a patching reboot and it's definitely b/c my t key has recently been acting up. Cmd allowed it to boot up correctly.  <comment250814> That was it!  My keyboard is broken (it usually continually types the letter "T", so I have to disable it and use an external keyboard).  So, when I rebooted, the system interpreted the keyboard's input as "use Target Disk Mode".  I simply held down the "Cmd" key so that it became "Cmd-T", which prevented TDM.  I've successfully booted! <comment250817> If you add an answer in this regard, I'll accept it.  Good to have this knowledge stick around in the rare case someone else has the problem! :) <comment250818> Good to hear that your Mac works! I'll add my comment as an answer, then. <comment250819> It *was* TDM!  See my comment on the original question for what I did to "fix" the problem. <comment356792> Me ttttoo.  Thanks!ttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
