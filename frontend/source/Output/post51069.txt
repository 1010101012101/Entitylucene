Installing TextWrangler command line tools into /usr/bin <body> I just installed the text wrangler command line tools and they are placed into code/usr/local/bin/code by default.  On Lion this directory appears to be a root only directory, and I don't want to have to run the edit command as root.  However if I copy the edit command into code/usr/local/code it won't launch textwrangler. I can see the "edit" process running but text wranger isn't launched.  Is there a trick to getting edit working in code/usr/bin/code? The other command line tools from textwrangler work fine from there.  <answer51087> Sorry, but code/usr/bin/code is still a root/wheel directory, so it is actually going to be worse to install the textwrangler stuff there.  In any case, in your terminal type  codeecho $PATH/code and see if code/usr/local/bin/code is in the path.  If code/usr/local/bin/code is in your path all the stuff you install there will NOT need root permissions to be run.  If it is not, you can add it as such:  go to code/etc/paths.d//code  create a text file that you can call localstuff (or whatever)  edit localstuff putting code/usr/local/bin/code in it.  Example:  precode$ ls /etc/paths.d/ 50-X11   MacGPG2  TeX      TeXbin   git      julia  $ cat /etc/paths.d/julia  /usr/local/julia  $ echo $PATH /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11/bin:/usr/local/git/bin:/usr/local/julia:/usr/local/MacGPG2/bin:/usr/texbin:/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin /code/pre  make sure that your shell is a login shell in whatever terminal you are using, the OSX predicated way of adding stuff to code$PATH/code seems to break if you do not use a login shell.  As I said though, chances are that code/usr/local/bin/code is in your user's code$PATH/code anyway, so no need to worry.  I'd also move all the textwrangler files you put in code/usr/bin/code in code/usr/local/bin/code to avoid future problems.    <comment58451> You're right it doesn't need admin permissions to run, I guess at some point I might have changed the permissions on /usr/local/bin changing them back fixed the problem.
