Music Keeps deleting itself on iPhone 5s <body> My music keeps deleting off my iPhone 5s by itself. I go on iTunes and download the songs again but the next day half my music is gone again.  <comment213312> what are you synchronizing with ? <comment213315> Is your device managed by a corporate policy? This is common if your device happens to be used for work and they provide a stipend, and/or was a phone issued by your job. Sometimes, their mobile device management policies set restrictions on the types of music that are allowed and the music will self-delete if its found on the phone. <comment213329> iTunes Match I bet !
