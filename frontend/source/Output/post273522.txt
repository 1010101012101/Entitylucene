Remote file sharing between Macs with different Apple IDs/iCloud accounts <body> I have a 2011 iMac, 2013 MBA &amp; 2015 MBP all with different Apple IDs, for the family, wife's work &amp; my work respectively.  We share a lot of common files as we're both anaesthetists, but need different setups on our laptops, hence the different accounts.  Is there a way to remotely share the files stored on the family iMac whist maintaining the independence of the laptops?  Cheers, Luke
