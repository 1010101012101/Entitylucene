Why mouse zoom in,out not working on icloud.com find my iphon? <body> I am using Linux Ubuntu. When trying to use www.icloud.com/#find any mouse movements like zoom or scroll not working.  Any solutions?  <answer176530> I suggest you use the +/- buttons on the upper left. At the time of posting, there is no mouse-input way to zoom the map in or out.  I tested it on Safari on a Mac with Yosemite (10.10).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nrMqQ.png" alt="iCloud Find my iPhone"  <comment208494> More detail might help - what mouse movements? Clicking the +/- signs? dragging the map? <comment208500> Clicking to -/+ works. I wonder why can not we zoom in or zoom out with mouse? <comment208501> I am asking why there is no mouse input? <comment208503> I don't think it's designed to. Google Maps does, Apple's doesn't [at least not on that page] <comment208504> @akikara, As with all websites, that is an option that is left entirely to the developer(s) thereof. They would have to write the script to handle that. <comment208962> Fare enough but not satisfied. I will ask this to Apple. Thanks for your answer. Still I think there should be.
