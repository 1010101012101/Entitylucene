Mac prompts with `Enter passphrase for key on every login <body> I regularly use my Mac to codessh/code into other systems on my local network.  I have a public/private key (which was created years ago) so I can connect without using a password.  Recently (probably since upgrading to 10.12.4) the Mac prompts with codeEnter passphrase for key '/Users/user/.ssh/id_rsa':/code  Why has this suddenly started happening? The whole point of creating the key was to simplify logon; how can I get codessh/code to connect without asking for passphrase?
