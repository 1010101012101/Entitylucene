How can I remove this icon from the menu bar? <body> I am seeing attached icon in the top right menu bar. I tried deleting MenuExtras by going to code/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu Extras/codebut it didn't help, please help to hide or remove it.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/f65l5.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer86986> That's the VMware Fusion icon.  ol liClick it./li liSelect "strongApplication Menu Settings.../strong"./li liModify the dropdown next to "strongShow Applications menu in menu bar/strong" to be "strongNever/strong"./li /ol  <answer86987> That item is the VMWare fusion menu bar icon.  The vendor has this article and steps to allow you to disable and configure it.   http://kb.vmware.com/kb/1015330  To modify the behavior of this feature:  ol liGo to Virtual Machine  Settings./li liClick Application Menu (Applications in Fusion 3)./li liClick the Applications Menu tab if using Fusion 3./li liFrom the Show applications menu in menu bar drop-down, choose Always, strongNever/strong, or emOnly when Fusion is running/em./li /ol  <answer153893> spotlight - activity monitor - search for fusion - kill the process  <answer210703> I had the same problem in El Capitan  I selected "Never" but the icon kept reappearing after every restart.  However, after I created my first virtual machine, the "Never" option held and the icon has remained hidden.   Sounds crazy, but true.  <answer217930> It looks like the option is no longer configurable in vmware fusion 8, or maybe I didn't look in the right place. I had to kill it and rename it to prevent it from running. Haven't had obvious adverse effect yet. So, open a terminal  precodeps -fx | grep -i vmware kill xxx # the pid number, such as 51889 sudo mv "/Applications/VMware Fusion.app/Contents/Library/VMware Fusion Start Menu.app/Contents/MacOS/VMware Fusion Start Menu" "/Applications/VMware Fusion.app/Contents/Library/VMware Fusion Start Menu.app/Contents/MacOS/VMware Fusion Start Menu.bak" /code/pre  For someone who doesn't like command line, just rename the file, logout and login.   <answer239586> I had this icon appear after log in today. I do not have any virtual machines.  Another user has VMWare Fusion installed.  Here's how I solved it without messing with the installation.  ol liI used part of YH Wu's answer to kill it.

I didn't realize you could control it from the icon as well. My guess is the OP has a partial install and the icon could be malfunctioning. We'll see if they need uninstall help or just pointing to the right software is all they need to solve this. <comment186166> unfortunately, this doesn't work if the VM was deleted. <comment254061> In later versions of VMware Fusion this setting has been moved to the general preferences of VMware Fusion, and not related to the specific virtual machine. So from the "VMware Fusion" menu, select Preferences and the setting is now under the General tab. I have Fusion 8, I don't know when they moved this setting. <comment263422> Forgive my negativity but while this procedure most probably will remove the icon it's rather doubtable this is the solution the OP - if not anybody - is looking for.  Pulling the power plug will also remove the icon. <comment265440> In Fusion 8, it's configured globally under general settings <comment281915> Also, go to System Preferences  Users & Groups  ***username***  Login Items, and remove the VMWare launch application. <comment305144> This is a very bad idea, as removing that file inside the application invalidates the code signature. MacOS uses that signature to decide whether an application gets access to the keychain, iCloud and other services. Some services will just show a confirmation dialog again, others might just fail silently. Don't modify applications. <comment371718> When the trial period is over there is no way to access its preferences.  That is one messed up call vmware.
