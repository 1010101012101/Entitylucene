Use an old driver (for OSX 10.3) in a new mac (OSX 10.8/9) <body> I have a printer (Sansung ML-1250) that has driver for OSX 10.3 but now I have a new mac with OSX 10.9 and I'm not sure how to handle it.  Is there any solutions?  <answer117708> You are in luck. Your printer is supported by the Gutenprint open source printer drivers.   http://gimp-print.sourceforge.net/MacOSX.php  Install these and you should be OK. You may find not all functions of the printer are supported but usually with Gutenprint they come close.  <answer117709> The OS X Printer driver framework was heavily overhauled around the time of 10.6 so, to be frank, there's not a hope in hell that it'll work. You'll need to replace your printer with something newer.  <answer117711> Unless you have a Macbook which you can set back to 10.3 there's no way you can use it anymore.  Old printers are a pain for new software, as they will always remain slower than the applications (in the future) will ever be.  Sorry but no, you have either have a 2nd machine which you can set back to 10.3 or you have to get a newer printer.
