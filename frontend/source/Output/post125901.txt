While trying to make input file, I'm getting the error which looks like   codeError: Couldn't open input file (-43)/code   Here is what I've done so far   code/usr/bin/afconvert -f caff -d LEI16@44100 inputSoundFile.aiff outputSoundFile.caf/code  How can I fix this error?  <comment147359> Thanks @Rob for edit my question and make it meaningful :)
