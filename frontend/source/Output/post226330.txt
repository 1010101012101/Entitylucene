Safari Bookmarks not syncing via iCloud issue <body> I am frustrated by this issue that just appeared recently.  No matter what I do, any modification (rearranging, deletion) to the bookmarks are soon reverted.  the bookmarks are now totally out of sync with my iOS devices.  OS X version 10.11.3 (15D21) Safari Version 9.0.3 (11601.4.4)  Pls see my youtube vid for demo of the issue: https://youtu.be/ktxo1VVEwBI  <answer227985> You need to reset your Safari Bookmark. See this:  How can I reset the Safari bookmarks in iCloud?  Simplified steps:  ol li Turn off iCloud Safari sync on all devices/li li Backup current bookmarks on Mac/li li Delete bookmarks on all devices/li li Turn on Safari syncing on Mac/li li Restore bookmark backup file to ~/Library/Safari folder/li li Turn on bookmark syncing on all iOS devices/li /ol  The original author of these suggestions noted the following: "Once I turned syncing back on each device remained blank for quite some time. I’m not sure why but I was able to prod the system along by adding a fake bookmark on another device. This seemed to kick everything into gear and I was able to delete that fake bookmark on different device – which eventually deleted it across all devices."
