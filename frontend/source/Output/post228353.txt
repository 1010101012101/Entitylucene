El Capitan changes language input after reboot <body> every time I restart my Mac (OS X El Capitan 10.11.3), the language input is set to "ABC Extended" instead of English or German. This causes me trouble when I want to type my password. Is there a way to set this back to English or German?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8Qaun.png" alt="These are the keyboards I have installed."  <answer228354> One workaround is to open System Preferences - Users &amp; Groups - Login Items and enable "Show input menu in login screen".  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/e4IlA.png" alt="enter image description here"  After enabling the checkbox you can choose between several input sources in the upper right corner.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/j6ymS.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment278531> I do have that enabled. I was just wondering if there's a way that it's German right from the get-go.  Thanks anyway. <comment310430> Thank you so much! I have been going crazy over this for such a long time and over several versions of OSX, as well as the latest El Capitan. I went in the settings above and saw my box for "show input menu in login window" was unchecked, so i checked it. And voila... now my native language still is the selected one after a reboot.
