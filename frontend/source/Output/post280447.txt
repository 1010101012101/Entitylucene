Preview.app keyboard shortcuts messed up by default in Mac OS Sierra <body> I have macOS sierra installed in french, and when I try to use Preview I get the silliest, most useless shortcuts of all time:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3n3Gn.png" alt="the menu showing the shortcuts"  I modified the Real size (taille r√©elle) one to the default english one, but I was wondering if there was a fix for this that didn't involve manually reasigning every single one (also, I couldn't find the default ones in my most recent google search). For the record, I used macOS in spanish before, and I didn't get this kind of issue.  Appreciate any help! (please refrain from advising me to roll back to english, I'm trying to preserve my french here). Thanks!
