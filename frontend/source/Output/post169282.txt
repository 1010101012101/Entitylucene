iPod Touch will charge from computer USb, but not from AC outlet <body> I have an iPod Touch.  If I plug it into the AC outlet, with a AC/USB power adapter, the iPod will charge to about 20%, and then stop charging.  However, if I plug it into a computer USB outlet (using the SAME USB cable), it will charge fully to 100%.  Electricity is electricity, no matter where it comes from, so why wouldn't it charge from an AC outlet?  <answer169290> It sounds to me like your AC to USB charger is having a problem with heat.  It charges for a while (while heating up) then it stops.  If you let it cool down for a while I assume it continues charging.  In any case, I would suggest replacing it.  <comment198814> your AC-USB is broken! <comment198849> Actually, no, it's perfectly fine.  And, I have to add that I also use this same AC adapter to charge other items (including an Android tablet and my Samsung Galaxy S4), and NEVER have a problem with it.  The problem occurs ONLY with the iPod Touch.  I've also tried a different AC adapter, and the exact same thing happens.  So, the only common denominator is the iPod. <comment198850> Actually, no, it's perfectly fine.

Just because the charger works with other devices doesn't guarantee that _everything_ will work with it. Simple test: try another AC charger. <comment198949> As you can see from my comment above, I have ALREADY tried another AC charger.  Same result.
