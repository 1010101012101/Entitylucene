files not appear on Desktop and Drag & Drop is not working on Desktop <body> I am using 10.11.4 OS X. I don’t know when exactly these are not working - files don't appear on desktop. Drag &amp; Drop and popping up context menu with right click are not working on Desktop. - I’ve googled this problem and found no solution. Does anyone have any suggestions to fixing this?  <answer238629> Just in case it's your preferences that have got corrupted somehow, you could try the following two commands in the Terminal:  precode$ defaults write com.apple.finder CreateDesktop true $ killall Finder /code/pre  <comment292681> I don't know now, sometimes it does work you say? You can try relaunching finder cmd-optn-esc and then choose finder), you can try checking the disk in Disk Utility, try resetting p-ram (reboot holding command-option-p-r till it reboots a second time). Also 10.11.5 is out, it might have a fix. <comment292682> Other than that I would wonder do you have enough ram, do you have plenty of room on your hard drive, does activity monitor show that your CPU isn't too busy doing other things. Maybe there's a rogue process taking up all the ram or cpu so the computer can't deal with the desktop? <comment292830> What a good workaround!
