Songs stuck in "Automatically add to iTunes" folder and not going to iTunes Library <body> I had some MP3s that I wanted to put onto my iPod so I copy and pasted them to my iTunes Media folder and then dragged and dropped them in the "Automatically Add to iTunes" folder but they haven't been added to my iTunes Library and, when, I open the folder they're just there. That's never happened before and I've dragged and dropped MP3s in the same way many a time. So why won't it work this time?  <comment73333> Does it create a 'Not Added' folder inside 'Automatically Add To iTunes'?
