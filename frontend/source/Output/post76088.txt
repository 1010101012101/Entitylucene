How do I give a user sudo permissions? <body> On my computer I have two accounts: geoff and admin. I want to do codegacutil.../code. Doing it in account geoff (where I need it to be done) I get the message:   precodegac directories could not be created, possibly permission issues. /code/pre  When I login as admin this seems to work fine.   So I go back to the geoff account and try codesudo gacutil.../code and putting the password for geoff but it tells me that geoff is not in the sudoers file.  So it seems that I either have to get geoff in as a sudoer (how?) or else get my admin account to do the gacutil on geoff's behalf (is this possible?).  <answer76094> To add a user to sudoers, as admin do codesudo visudo/code  Then scroll down to    precode# User privilege specification root    ALL=(ALL) ALL %admin  ALL=(ALL) ALL /code/pre  place the cursor at the next (empty) line, and press codea/code (for append). Then type    precodeshortname   ALL=(ALL) ALL /code/pre  where codeshortname/code is the short name for the user that you are adding to sudoers (there should be codeTAB/code between the short name and ALL). After that press codeESC/code (to exit append mode). Then type code:wq/code and then codeEnter/code to quit visudo, saving the changes.  <answer76096> Rather than give codegeoff/code sudo privileges, consider adding the account to the codeadmin/code group so that it inherits the admin group sudoer privileges. This would be the more correct way to do things.  To add codegeoff/code to the codeadmin/code group you'll need to run the following as the codeadmin/code account:  precodesudo dseditgroup -o edit -a geoff -t user admin /code/pre  You may also want to consider putting codegeoff/code in the codewheel/code group too:  precodesudo dseditgroup -o edit -a geoff -t user wheel /code/pre  The codewheel/code group is a BSD-ism, where OS X has its roots. In traditional BSD systems the codewheel/code group was used to keep a collection of users who were allowed to become superusers using the codesu/code command. It's not strictly necessary to be in both codeadmin/code and codewheel/code but anyone setup as as "Administrator" on the machine through the UI for adding a user is in both so it can't hurt to replicate that setup.  <comment198877> Consider also this answer: http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/126400 <comment258465> This is an interesting suggestion but be aware that this may allow the user to access more then just `sudo`. For instance, adding a user to the `admin` group would allow write access to the `/Applications/` directory, which could lead to security issues or the accidental modifications. <comment269110> To reverse this change, change the -a (add) flag to -d (delete):  `sudo dseditgroup -o edit -d geoff -t user admin` <comment361764> what if your shortname has a '.' in it.
