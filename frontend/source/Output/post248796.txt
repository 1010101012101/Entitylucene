Why can't I get to disk utilities to format the new SSD installed in my mid 2009 Macbook Pro? <body> I install a new SSD to my mid 2009 Macbook Pro. Attach a bootable USB drive to the MBP. When I power up the machine, I hold down the "Option + R" Keys until apple logo shows up. The boot up process goes straight to OS X installation. I never see disk utility screen during this process. I wonder how I can format the new SSD if I can not get access to disk utilities. I also tried "option + cmd + R" keys. It did not work either.  <comment308401> Can you close, cancel or quit the Install OS X screen? It should show the OS X Utilities, where you can choose Disk Utility https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201314
