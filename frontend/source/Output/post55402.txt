Where can I find the phone number of the SIM card that I have in an iPad? <body> Is there a way, directly on the iPad, to find out which phone number is associated to the MicroSIM which it is using?  I can't find it in the menus, currently.  Is there an easy way to find it directly, like on an iPhone?  <answer55403> h3Settings &#x2192; General &#x2192; About &#x2192; Celluar Data Number/h3  <answer211489> dial #100# and the number will be shown. If it doesn't work the first time try again. It works on cell phones.  <answer247125> From the device, you can get this through Settings  Tap General  Tap About  Scroll to view the IMEI/ICCID/my Number.  <comment63607> Hm, this is probably the way to go, but it gives me "Unknown", for some reason. <comment63608> @Gnoupi, I've had the same problem on my iPhone. I don't believe you can retrieve the phonenumber from your iPad then. To resolve it I had to put the SIM card in an old Sony-Ericsson phone and edit it myself. <comment63609> @Gnoupi Then you should try to retrieve it via iTunes using this [Apple info](https://support.apple.com/kb/HT4061). <comment63610> @Gerry According to the video you can retrieve "phonenumbers" from your SIM using the iPad. But if this is a specific SIM for an iPad, the operator may have decided to not use a cellular data number because they don't need it for billing purposes. <comment63611> @gentmatt - It's not showing up in iTunes either, so I guess it's coherent with the rest. Since this is based on a pre-paid card, it might be the reason why the provider doesn't show the number. Your solution is the one for most other cases, though. <comment255290> Ok, where do you want me to dial that? :)
