Inbox by Google doesn't update unless opened <body> Despite being setup to allow background refresh, Inbox does not notify of new emails unless I manually open the app. How can I fix this?  <answer265094> Go to Settings  Inbox and check that it is allowed to access Background App Refresh and  Cellular Data  <comment332159> It does not notify of new email but it is already downloaded or it is downloaded when you open the app? Also, is "Low power mode" on? <comment332239> No low power. I open it and I have to refresh the view.
