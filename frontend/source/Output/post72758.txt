Mountain Lion 10.8 cmd+shif+arrow key bindings not working <body> I have switched Cmd and Ctrl in System preferences.br I have the following key bindings defined:  precode"@\UF702"  = "moveWordBackward:";                            /* Cmd  + LeftArrow */ "@\UF703"  = "moveWordForward:";                             /* Cmd  + RightArrow */ "$@\UF702" = "moveWordBackwardAndModifySelection:";   /* Shift + Cmd  + Leftarrow */ "$@\UF703" = "moveWordForwardAndModifySelection:";   /* Shift + Cmd  + Rightarrow */ /code/pre  But they are not being used, instead of selecting the next word it selects until the next end of line.  PS I used the instructions here http://benogle.com/2010/01/18/windowslinux-developers-remap-your-mac.html  <answer72760> Found the answer here http://heisencoder.net/2008/04/fixing-up-mac-key-bindings-for-windows.html  precodeit seems Cocoa doesn't like the $ to be infront of the @ /code/pre
