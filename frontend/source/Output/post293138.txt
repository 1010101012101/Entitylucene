Unable to switch keyboard layout <body> I just rebooted and for some reason am unable to switch keyboard layouts.  This feature had been working previously since just after getting the computer (and setting up the alternate keyboard layout).  The secondary input source is shown here:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6OAH3.png" alt="enter image description here"  My attempt to select the alternate input source is shown here:  note I clicked on codeusd2/code.  However strongthe input source did not change as a result/strong.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HZAYy.png" alt="enter image description here"  I did not do anything related to keyboard settings for quite some time so it is puzzling this problem just showed up.  I am on Sierra with MBPro 2015.  <answer293175> I re-added the emsame/em keyboard input:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ef9uU.png" alt="enter image description here"  .. and the emsecond/em one is working.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lEpTN.png" alt="enter image description here"  I have no idea why this emsuddenly/em started failing.  <comment369865> Do you have Siri turned on?  If so, turn it off and change its keyboard shortcut to "none" and restart and see if that helps. <comment369866> You are using a custom keyboard layout.  Do you have the same problem when using one provided with MacOS, like Spanish or French or ABC Extended? <comment369874> Instead of clicking on the input menu in the menu bar, can you change the keyboard via the standard keyboard shortcut Control plus Space (or sometimes Command plus Space)? <comment369885> @TomGewecke Siri has always been off. <comment369904> Do you have two of them also showing in system preferences/keyboard/input sources? <comment369908> @TomGewecke updated the answer
