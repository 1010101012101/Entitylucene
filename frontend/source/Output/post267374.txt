Pinta Question - MAC <body> I need help, I had windows that had Paint.net, and it had everything that I needed, I switched to mac, and tried to find every possible resource related to paint.net, and I found paint.net. I noticed that pinta doesn't have a transparent tool, how do I make things transparent on pinta? Please help.
