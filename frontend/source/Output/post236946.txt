Reminder triggered when certain person calls? <body> iPhone reminders have a nice feature where you can remind yourself to do something when arriving or leaving a certain location.  Is it possible to do something similar, but replacing the location trigger with a "person X calls trigger".  For example: "Reminder me to tell John that story when John calls."  In general, is there a way to attach additional triggers to reminders?  <answer236947> I don't know of a way but when I need to do this, I change the contact name temporarily. Instead of "John" it would be "Tell John story".  <comment290078> Ha, pretty good hack <comment290080> Easier if you change the nickname :) <comment290487> Nope, you can't. Android and Windows Phone only, sadly. <comment290578> Is it impossible to do this with 3rd party apps as well? <comment290646> Yes because iOS does not allow apps to see when someone is calling you. Your carrier could have a way to remind you about something when someone calls you, but that's a long shot.
