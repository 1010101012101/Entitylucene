How can I pair an Apple Watch with a jailbroken iPhone 5c running iOS 8.4? <body> When I attempt to do so, a prompt appears telling me to update my phone's iOS. I am wondering whether there is a workaround; I do not want to lose my jailbreak. Thank you in advance.   <answer253917> WatchOS 2 is supported only on devices running iOS 9 and higher.  The only way to run an Apple Watch using an iPhone running iOS 8.4 is to have an Apple Watch with watchOS 1.x.  <comment316039> What version of watchOS?  There's minimum requirements for the watch and iOS versions. <comment316042> @fbara I am not sure; I don't even know how to check a watch's OS...
