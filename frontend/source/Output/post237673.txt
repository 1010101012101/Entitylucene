Could we turn on word wrap Safari Web Inspector? <body> I think it's a bug for sure.  Older Safari versions, it has word wrap in that area but when updated, it seems there is no word wrap in web inspector console.   Could we reenable it again ? Is that possible ?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wFEV8.png" alt="http://prntscr.com/b1yx57"  <answer238875> Word wrap works a little differently, but actually more accurate, in the latest versions of Safari, depending on the mode you're displaying.  For instance, in the "strongElements/strong" tab, it will wrap as desired:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/z21bq.png" alt="enter image description here"  But, like in your screenshot, the "strongResources/strong" tab for instance, it will display as the rendering engine intended, unwrapped:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rM3Ex.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment294020> It means we cant do it, in Resources tab ?
