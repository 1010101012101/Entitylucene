Is there a terminal command to open applications in a specific Desktop? <body> For example when I run codeopen -a Kodi/code I'd like to be able to specify which Desktop I'd want the application to launch in.   Trying to avoid dragging/dropping to the desired workspace.   <answer238542> You can permanently assign an app to a Space by right-clicking the app in the dock  Options  Assign to... This Desktop.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZIQUJ.png" alt="enter image description here"  A faster way to move it to any given Space is to grab the window's title bar, then use your regular shortcut to switch to the desired Space. By default that would be kbd Ctrl âŒƒ /kbd kbd em[number]/em /kbdbr See System Prefs  Keyboard  Shortcuts  Mission Control if you've never set that up. [Note that it differentiates between the numbers above  qwerty &amp; numbers on a 10-key pad &amp; considers them different keys]  <comment292574> Options  Assign to... is no longer available. <comment292578> @jherran - Since when? It's still available as of 10.11.4 Picture added. <comment292579> Never mind. Will be out in 10.11 betas and thought that will be out now. I was wrong. As you say is still there. <comment292580> I really hope they're not going to break Spaces any more than they already did when they added Mission Control :( <comment292587> Hmmm... 10.11.5 has arrived in my updates... will report back... :/ <comment292590> @jherran - still there in 10.11.5 :)
