Purchased/Rented movie is not played <body> I have purchased/rented a movie (SD) and it is not playing... I have downloaded 1GB and the alert "ready to play" does not appear. Besides this, a doubleclick opens the Quicktime window and the player icons, but the movie does not start. The correct time is displayed and when I scroll the timeline I can see the pictures, but the play-button does not start playing the movie... I have the same problem with another movie :-(  strongEDIT/strong: I used the native Apple iTunes Store (is there any other store?!)  <answer74371> Try setting your computers clock a day in advance.  I have seen a time-zone issue where the the movie won't play until the computers clock is set to the following day.  Give that a try.  <answer113216> re-start your device, and take a try.  <comment86375> What service did you download the movie from or through? <comment86379> @TomUnderhill I have edited my question <comment86382> Amazon also offers movie rentals. Didn't want to make false assumptions!
