Can I stream media from one Plex server to another Plex server? <body> I have Plex on a laptop and I can use Plex for the iDevices to stream media to them.  Can I do the same with Plex on another computer around the house like ZumoCast?  <answer22752> Yes.  For more complete information:  http://wiki.plexapp.com/index.php/Plex_Nine_Configurations_test  <answer28613> Any device with the plex front end, ie, iDevice, apple TV, LG medialink, &amp; apple computers, can see any Plex server that is running on your local network.  <answer175014> I believe so, just login Plex on another computer, and access it, you can stream media date from Plex to your iDevices.  <comment24790> Are you saying that Plex media server A has access to your media, and Plex media server B doesn't?  And you want to stream media from A while connected to B (B streams from A, and you stream from B)?
