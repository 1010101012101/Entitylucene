Copy mail message to folder in favorites <body> I've found the handy shortcut mentioned elsewhere to emmove/em mail messages to certain folders - basically you add some folders to the "favorites bar" and then you can jump to those folders with "cmd-number" where "number" is the order of the favorites bar items from left to right.  One can also move a message with "ctrl-cmd-number".  This is great.  I'm training a spam filter and I have both my "ham" and "spam" folders in the favorites bar.  The problem I have is that much of the "ham" needs to be copied, not moved.  Nowhere am I finding a full keyboard shortcut reference for mail.app (including mail.app help and the apple support site). Is copying to favorites possible?  edit: OS-X 10.12 and stock Mail.app  <comment358508> Welcome to Ask Different.
