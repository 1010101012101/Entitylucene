Automator workflow runs forever <body> I have run into a problem with automator: I have a workflow that does image processing (it converts color images to gray). I am able to invoke the workflow from the terminal and it works fine. The command is:    automator -i infile.jpg imageconversion.workflow  However, I am facing a problem when I try to integrate this workflow in a webapp, build in Django and deployed with mod_wsgi on Apache. The workflow gets invoked (I can see this from the webapp logs), but it runs forever, and eventually apache will kill the child process after several minutes.   I am running OS X 10.9  Has anybody encountered a similar issue?  Thanks, Gerald  <answer123471> h1Limitations of Automator/h1  Your Automator workflow may require access to the WindowServer to work. Automator is designed to be run within an active user session, and not from a shell session.  The Apache user launching your Automator workflow is running without access to the WindowServer and this will likely limit which actions you can use.  h2ImageMagik/h2  Consider using an image processing tool designed for command line use, such as ImageMagik. Take a look at the -greyscale option for your conversion:  precodeconvert in.png -grayscale Rec709Luminance out.png /code/pre
