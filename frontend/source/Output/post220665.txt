Virtual Machine support for DirectX 11 (Windows 10) hosted on OS X <body> does anyone know if there is currently any virtualisation software that supports creating a Windows 10 virtual machine with support to DirectX 11?   From what I have found online, bootcamp supports this, but this wouldn't be a solution for me (it will need you to exit OS X and restart to use windows).  The most popular tools VMWare Fusion (v8) and Parallels (v11) only support up to DirectX 10  Is there any other alternative around that does support DirectX 11 now?  hr  Update: As of November 2016, Parallels v12 still doesn't support DirectX 11 (only 10.1).  Update: Parallels has released v13 in August 2017, and surprise, surprise! DirectX 11 is not supported yet... as expected  <answer235790> Support Team says: It's planned to support directx11 in Parallels v12  <answer265473> There are other (less sophisticated) Windows emulators (CrossOver, Virtual Box, Q, et cetera) but none that support DirectX 11 or higher. Hopefully something will be developed in 2017, but for now I am positive there is none as I've researched this extensively for years and additionally I predict that if there were it would be talked about everywhere.  <comment288423> Please could you edit your answer and add a link to the page where the support team mentions this.
