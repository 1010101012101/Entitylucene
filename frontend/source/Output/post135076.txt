Why does Chrome starts fullscreen? <body> With Mac OS Mavericks and Chrome 35 : everytime I start my computer, the first time I launch Chrome, it starts in fullscreen mode. If I exit fullscreen, quit Chrome and then restart it, it's normal. If I reboot (I don't check "open my apps on startup") and re-launch, it starts again in fullscreen.  Why does it do this ?  Thanks  h1Edit/h1  Actually after further testing, it doesn't always start in fullscreen after a reboot, it seems pretty random.  <answer135078> You could perform the following steps:  ol liNavigate to strongchrome://settings/strong/li liPress the radio buttons next to strongContinue where I left off/strong and under the strongOn Startup/strong header. /li liReboot as you've tried and it should remain non-fullscreen next time./li /ol  <answer164846> The way I solved this problem is by going to chrome settings and signing in with my google credentials... After that it stopped going into full screen mode automatically.  <comment160075> Are you actually using the full screen mode in Chrome with some web sites? <comment160108> No, I never do, or almost. I never quit chrome while in full screen. Maybe just *after* closing a full-screen video, but not during. <comment160109> It's already like that :/ <comment160110> Then select the other option, the first one. To start with the home page. <comment160253> Well, first, I *want* to continue where I left off. And second, it doesn't always do that, so I don't see how that would help.
