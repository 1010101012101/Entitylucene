iOS Safari lag when trying to type into a <input>-field <body> I'm currently working on a website for my school to reserve seats in a room. On the same website, you have the ability to search for a specific name, if you want to check, where someone else sits.   But the problem is, when I want to write something into the input-field, it takes about 3 seconds for the letter to appear in the box.  This problem only appears on my own website, all the other sites are still fine.  precode&lt;td style="width:50%;"&gt;&lt;input type="text" id="search" placeholder="Enter name"&gt;&lt;/td&gt; /code/pre  This is one of the input fields I'm using, it's just a normal field with no special events or anything else.  = At first I thought it was just for me, but even the other students arent able to write into the field without any lags.  Do you have any ideas how to fix this problem?
