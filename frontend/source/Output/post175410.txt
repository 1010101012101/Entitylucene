Applescript to click green (zoom) button with Option down <body> Based on Applescript - the activate command makes application &quot;half-active&quot;, I wrote the following Applescript which would allow me to click the green (zoom) button at the top-left corner of an window. I want to apply the script to MacVim and others which have the green button as "AXFullScreenButton". But, running the script makes the window to FULL SCREEN rather than a "maximized" window. Can anyone tell what is wrong?  precodetell application "System Events"     key down option     click (first button whose subrole is "AXFullScreenButton") of (first window whose subrole is "AXStandardWindow") of (first process whose frontmost is true)     key up option     set frontApp to (name of first application process whose frontmost is true) as string end tell tell application frontApp to activate /code/pre  <answer220151> You can use one of the actions of the "strongAXFullScreenButton/strong":   ul li"strongAXZoomWindow/strong" action to maximize./li li"strongAXPress/strong" action to full screen./li /ul  Use the codeperform action/code command, like this.  precodetell application "System Events"     perform action "AXZoomWindow" of (first button whose subrole is "AXFullScreenButton") of (first window whose subrole is "AXStandardWindow") of (first process whose frontmost is true) end tell /code/pre  <comment206829> The green button has never meant maximize, at least in the sense of maximizing a window in Windows, and has always been kind of hit-or-miss as to what it actually does. Recently, though, it's changed function to operate as "switch to full screen". That is the function of the button, so your script is operating correctly for what you are telling it to do. <comment206838> By "maximize", I meant "maximize" in the Mac sense, i.e. enlarging a window. I know that the function of the green button has changed in Yosemite. However, the behavior of the green button depends on whether or not Option is pressed (eg. Safari). With Option pressed, the button behaves in the "classic" way (enlarging a window rather than a full screen). For example, see this [link]( http://osxdaily.com/2014/10/28/maximize-zoom-windows-os-x-mac/). <comment266422> Hi, thanx a lot.   I*d never heard of a "perform action" command before. Where did you get your "inspiration"?!? <comment266545> @clensam lang,  In the AppleScript dictionary of "System Events" : look at **Processes Suite** -- the `perform` command, and the `UI element`-- contains **actions, attributes, browsers, and many more**. <comment266725> When I told Script-Editor to display all actions of Green button, it said: . . . {action "AXPress" of button 2 of window "No title" of application process "Script Editor" of application "System Events",  action "AXZoomWindow" of button 2 of window "No title" of application process "Script Editor" of application "System Events"} . . .  But Accessibility Inspector always listed "accessibilityPerformPress" under "Actions", no matter whether "option" was pressed:   WHERE can one learn the "functions" a button contains? <comment267181> Use the old "**UIElementinspector**" application, download this archive -- `https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#samplecode/UIElementInspector/UIElementInspector.zip` This archive contains the source code and the application. <comment268170> I couldn't get your link to work (for me). _Accessibility Inspector_ did just what I described 2 posts above. What _DID_ get a result was: `tell application "System Events" to actions of (first button whose subrole is "AXFullScreenButton") of (first window whose subrole is "AXStandardWindow") of (first process whose frontmost is true)`. THAT one returned `action "AXPress" of button 2 of […], action "AXZoomWindow" of button 2 […]`... though.
