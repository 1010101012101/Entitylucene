Quick way to toggle between "Larger Text", "Default", and "More Space" on Macbook Retina <body> On Macbook's with retina display you are able to select between 4 different scale modes as showed in the picture below  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8lz89.png" alt="The different display scale modes"  It takes some clicks to get into the Display settings and choosing a new scale. I guess I am not the only one changing the scale frequently so I am confident that an easier solution to this exists.   strongQuestion:/strong Are there any keyboard shortcuts that toggles the different scale modes without the need of third party software?   <answer228533> You can use Automator to script things like that since OS X does't include a built in command key for that option. Once it's scripted, you can then assign a key shortcut to that script/action.  Open automator and search for the "watch me do" action for scripting of the UI.  Relevant tutorials are at https://macosxautomation.com/automator/foo.html  <answer228552> I highly recommend using SwitchResX. You can easily switch resolutions from the menu bar instead of going through the codeSettings.app/code and you can set hotkeys for predefined resolutions/configurations as shown in the screenshot below:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3Kl4t.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment278677> So no :( I was hoping to avoid any other software. Instead it should be as if you were changing the volume on the function buttons.
