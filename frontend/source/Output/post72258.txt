How can I boot to Windows on my Mac? <body> I have a MacBook Pro that I installed Windows 8 on via Boot Camp. I've managed to boot to it, before, but since then I've made two new partitions on the disk, and I'm afraid it's messed things up since I can't boot to Windows anymore.  Now when I select which partition to boot to, I can only see my Mac OSX, A backup partition, and the Recovery partition. The Windows partition does appear in Disk Utility though.  What have I done wrong?  <answer72262> Try going to System Preferences...  There in the System row go to Statup Disk  And select the Windows partition.  Restart...  hr  During Startup try holding the kbdoption/kbd key. You should be able to select the partition you will boot from.
