Have iPad with iOS 7 ask for network password <body> I'd like to have my iPad prompt me for my WiFi password when it's turned on.  Is there a way to set that up?  The Google results are for people who see this as a problem, but for me, it would be a feature!  <answer132187> This is currently not possible without manually forgetting the network each time from Settings â†’ Wi-Fi. The password is stored on the device and isn't lost automatically.
