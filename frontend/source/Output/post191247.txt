Is there a way to remove a server account network entry from terminal? <body> I have a Mac mini running Mac OS X 10.10.3. It has an open directory server configured in the server account network configuration in 'Users and groups'.  Is there a way to remove that server account network entry from terminal?  To be more specific, I want to log in with the local user and remove the connection with the directory service for that particular server using the terminal.  <answer191261> After searching for a few hours I've finally found the command!  precodedsconfigldap -r *servername* /code/pre  <comment227121> Please be more specific. What have you tried? What type of server? Of course it could be possible but what server? <comment227131> Simply, I have a mac mini running Mac OS X 10.10.3. It has an open directory server configured in the server account network configuration in Users and groups. Now, my question is: is there a way to remove that server account network entry from terminal? <comment227132> Is [this](http://www.kombitz.com/2013/11/07/how-to-delete-a-local-user-using-command-line-on-mac-os-x/) helpful? It deletes a local user <comment227135> Unfortunately not, what I want is to log in with the local user and remove the connection with the directory service for that particular server using the terminal <comment227136> I guess you could kill the connection. [This](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/134714/kill-tcp-connections-on-a-mac-in-terminal) might help. The first answer <comment227144> I'm sorry but unfortunately it's not helpful. Do you know if the server account network's value is stored in a plist file? Maybe it's possibile to edit it with the command "defaults". <comment227145> Probably not. defaults is for user settings. But I might be wrong. A this point, I can't help...
