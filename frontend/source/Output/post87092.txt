How can I configure my Ethernet connection when booting from Recovery HD? <body> I'm trying to recover from a Time Machine drive sitting on the network at work. Our network doesn't use DHCP–it requires the Ethernet connection to be manually configured. I've looked at the Network Utility while booted to the Recovery HD and I have a 169.254.x.x IP address. Is there any way to manually configure the Ethernet connection?  <answer87098> The expected graphical settings are not provided from the recovery image, but you can find terminal in the Utilities folder and use codeipconfig/code to set a manual IP address and net mask for any active interface.     ipconfig set en1 manual 192.168.3.1 255.255.255.0   As long as your Wi-Fi isn't connected, you should have a valid route, but you could also set a default coderoute/code if needed using that command as well.  <answer258630> I found an answer in this blog post by maninara, referencing this apple support document. One can use the Terminal to perform this configuration:  ol liStart Terminal from Utilities menu/li licodenetworksetup -listallnetworkservices/code to see name of service/li licodenetworksetup -setmanual "‹service›" ‹address› ‹netmask› ‹router›/code/li licodenetworksetup -setdnsservers "‹service›" ‹dns1› [‹dns2›…]/code/li licodenetworksetup -getinfo "‹service›"/code and codenetworksetup -getdnsservers "‹service›"/code to verify configuration if you want to/li liTerminate Terminal application and launch a recovery option/li /ol  Example (adapted from a Yosemite recovery session):  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"code-bash-3.2# networksetup -listallnetworkservices Ethernet Wi-Fi Thunderbold Bridge -bash-3.2# networksetup -setmanual "Ethernet" 192.168.1.200 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.1 -bash-3.2# networksetup -setdnsservers "Ethernet" 192.168.1.1 192.168.1.25 8.8.8.8 -bash-3.2# networksetup -getinfo "Ethernet" Manual Configuration IP address: 192.168.1.200 Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0 Router: 192.168.1.1 IPv6: Automatic IPv6 IP address: none IPv6 Router: none Ethernet Address: ab:cd:ef:12:34:56 -bash-3.2# networksetup -getdnsservers "Ethernet" 192.168.1.1 192.168.1.25 8.8.8.8 /code/pre
