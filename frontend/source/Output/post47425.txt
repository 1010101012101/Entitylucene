How do I prevent the mirror-effect in video recordings in Photo Booth? <body> I am trying to record a lecture using Photo Booth on my Macbook but I want to be able to record what the professor has on the board. Unfortunately, photobooth seems to have a mirror image, so that all the writing is reversed. How do I get the camera to be a normal non-mirror camera?  <answer47427> In the menu bar click Edit, then "Auto Flip New Items". After you do that, the photos and videos you take will capture what the camera sees, and not reverse it.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yM5Mq.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer76154> Record using QuickTime.   I was having same problem and rather than change PhotoBooth to flip all images, I use one app to record people making fun faces and another for lectures.  <answer81668> I had exactly this problem for a presentation, so wrote a app called QCamera which supports both mirrored and normal capture.  You can download it for free from the Mac App Store.    https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id598853070?mt=12  <comment250065> Does this affect the on-screen live preview? It didn't for me... it's still reversed. <comment250087> @LarsH Weirdly, auto-flipping videos doesn't seem to work for me in Yosemite. It still works for photos - the preview is mirrored, but the resulting image is flipped back. <comment250124> Thank you for this. I had a presentation to give tonight in which I was showing a live (not recorded) webcam feed on a big external monitor. I couldn't do it in PhotoBooth without it being reversed. I downloaded QCamera and it worked like a charm. <comment321369> Unfortunately, this works only for photos.
