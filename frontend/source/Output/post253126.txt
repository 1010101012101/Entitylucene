AppleScript handler for network connection changes <body> Is there a way using AppleScript to detect when the computer connects to a network (just the connection, not a specific network)? I would like to have a script running that detects when a network (primarily interested in Wifi) connects, and then execute various blocks depending on what network it is. Right now, I've got code running in an on idle block checking for ssid name, but I'd rather execute it exactly when a new ssid is chosen.   <comment315010> Please add some details (like the content of the "various blocks"/"idle block") to your question. Related [AppleScript - determine the network service to which the current IP address is bound](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24481275/applescript-determine-the-network-service-to-which-the-current-ip-address-is-b). <comment315031> I've gotten the rest of it working. I just need to know if there is a good way to detect when ssid changes occur. <comment315090> Your comment isn't helpful at all. There are some solutions like *ControlPlane* or maybe *Alfred* or even a launch daemon/agent (+ shell script) which are less costly in terms of cpu cycles than an AppleScript solution. <comment315136> No need to be rude--if you don't want to answer questions, don't. I'm not asking for other solutions, I'm only asking if AppleScript is capable.
