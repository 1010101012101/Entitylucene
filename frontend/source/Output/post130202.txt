rEFIt defaulting to 32bit kernel <body> rEFIt is defaulting to the 32bit kernel of OS X which will not boot and will show this error message:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/es4hY.jpg" alt="Boot error"  at boot I have to press F2 then manually select the 64bit kernel.  How do I change the default kernel to load?  <answer130210> At the OS X command line, try: codesudo nvram boot-args="arch=x86_64"/code.  hr  strongEDIT:/strong  Try resetting your NVRAM to get you back into OS X.  Since we added a value to the codeboot-args/code variable in NVRAM, resetting it will clear it out.  If/Once you get back into OS X, try the following per Apple:  precodesudo systemsetup -setkernelbootarchitecture x86_64 /code/pre  Rather than write into the NVRAM (which was likely modified by rEFIt), this writes a value to com.apple.Boot.plist and persists on the volume.  <comment152533> This didn't work.  It still fails to load the kernel at boot. - edit: now it won't boot either the 64 or 32 <comment152534> What do you see now?  Apple logo?  Error message? <comment152535> I updated the question to include a picture.
