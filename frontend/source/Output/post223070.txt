MacBook bought as new could potentially be a refurbished older model <body> In mid-2014, Wife bought a new MacBook directly from apple.com . Said laptop has been acting in some weird ways, like freezing and rebooting itself for no reason, or taking in the order of a full minute or two to start reacting when she opened it in the morning. She attributed it the OS the laptop came with (Maverick) being an inferior version. Now the laptop stopped working altogether ---as in, it won't boot, and it won't allow a fresh reinstall of the OS (either Maverick or other). We are putting our money on a hard drive failure. When she called Apple Support to have it taken care of, the conversation went like this:  precodeApple: can we have your laptop's serial number?

As to the second and third questions...emshrug/em  <comment270384> Welcome to Ask Different.. We strongly prefer one question per question. Would you mind splitting the side ones off on a new thread or holding them until the first one is more clear? It's hard to see what we could offer other than getting the sales invoice and calling back Apple to work out whether their records are wrong (which does happen from time to time) or if there was a snafu in shipping or labeling.
