How do I share my Internet connection with another MacBook via WLAN? <body> My MacBook is connected to Internet.  I want to share this connection with another MacBook via WLAN.  How do I achieve that?  <answer9309> If you are using your WiFi to connect to the internet, you cannot use it to also create a local network for other computers. If you are networked via something not-Wifi (Ethernet, FireWire, USB, etc.) then you can share your connection via WiFi.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7pkds.png" alt="enter image description here"  ol liGo to System Prefs  Sharing./li liSelect your existing connection under codeShare your connection from:/code/li liSelect codeAirport/code under codeTo computers using:/code/li liTurn on Internet Sharing with the checkbox on the left./li liThe network name will be the name of your computer./li /ol  <comment9843> Is your MacBook connected with WiFi or Ethernet? <comment40008> Isn't this kind of dangerous, this way you set up an totally unsecured acesspoint. Can it be secured? <comment43512> When you turn this on you are prompted to enter a password. <comment43563> @richarddas the password doesn't secure the network, it just makes sure you are an admin when you turn it on.
