bootcamp bootable usb cannot be created <body> os = Mavericks 10.9.2 BCA = Version 5.1.2  I have downloaded an ISO for 64 bit windows 8.1 after that i tried to make bootable usb from boot camp assistant but every time when its come to copying file it shows a message.img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/idf0E.png" alt="enter image description here"  Where does the Boot Camp Assistant (BCA) store install logs and messages so I can determine what specific error is preventing my install from proceeding?  <comment149868> Let's start over as I cleaned up the other thread. I'll also see if I can steer this into how to figure out where bootcamp logs errors... A quick search of http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5639 didn't yield me any quick clues for you. You might edit in the exact version of Windows 8.1 you are installing as it might need to be 64 bit version per the FAQ. <comment149873> yes its 64 bit. <comment149875> I have used multiple PD and also unmounted the .ISO image from disk utility but its again there mount automatically and when i again unmount it a dialog box appears and show that this cannot be unmounted and after 15 min the message appers that your notable drive cannot be created. <comment149935> problem solved. <comment149943> It's encouraged to answer your own question using the buttons below if you don't mind taking the time to assist others... <comment201867> Yeah could you post your answer so may this help others, please?
