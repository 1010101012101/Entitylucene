Mount a samba drive, with password from keychain <body> I have a problem with Jettison, that tries to remount a samba drive, that is protected by a password.  It uses the following command line:  precode/sbin/mount_smbfs //[user]@[server]/work /Volumes/work  /code/pre  Of course it fails since the password is not present (nor the -N switch)  I am aware that it should contain a password, but I do not want the app to know it. So my question is:  Is there a way to request the password like this (I am aware this is not correct):   precode/sbin/mount_smbfs //[user]: %keychain-&gt;[identified keychain]%@&lt;server&gt;/work /Volumes/work  /code/pre  <answer69496> There is a script able interface to the keychain and it is the codesecurity/code command.   If you are handy with shell scripting or another language and the password doesn't have spaces and odd characters you need to handle, you could follow this tutorial and teach yourself enough to get the password out of the keychain.   ul lihttp://blog.macromates.com/2006/keychain-access-from-shell//li /ul  So once you've figured out how to pass the password in as a command line argument codeuser:pass/code you could execute the security command inline or set a temporary variable to hold the value.   <comment80726> Which 3rd party tool are you using? <comment80784> i was aware of the "security" command, but i do not know how to set up a temp variable and add it to the command line. I guess that is more linux related that i can handle. <comment80785> I am investigating on behalf of Jettison (google it). Me and them try to figure a way to remount a samba drive, that fails because of being pass protected. <comment133486> You could check out mount_smbfs, assuming that your network shares are smbfs/cifs.  mount_smbfs [-N] [-o options] [-d mode] [-f mode] [-h] //[domain;][user[:password]@]server[/share] path I'm not intimately familiar with the OSX startup process, but it's possible you can create your shell-script as a program/folder in /Library/StartupItems or /System/Library/StartupItems  source: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1142286/using-a-bash-script-on-a-mac-to-connect-to-network-shares
