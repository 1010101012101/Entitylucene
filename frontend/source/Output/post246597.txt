How can I download ipa file from ipad on El Capitan? <body> Unfortunately Stash got removed from the iOS App Store, but I need to transfer it from my iPad onto my new iPhone. How can I do that? If I'm right first I need to download it and install it with iFunBox. Where does the iTunes store the ipa files when I do a manually backup?  PS: I tried to restore phone from iCloud backup, it tries to download it but it stuck on "Waiting.." status. The most important thing for me is the data in the app. I tried to contact the developer but I got an automatic reply.  <answer246615> Sync your iPad with iTunes, which will download all not already downloaded Apps to iTunes - and then sync your iPhone with iTunes - that's it.   iTunes store the ipa-files in code~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Mobile Applications/code  <comment304165> If the developer is still active and only pulled the app, u can still download it. Can you give us the app name
