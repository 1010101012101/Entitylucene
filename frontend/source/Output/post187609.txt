Stop iPhone from sending iMessages to OS X <body> I recently got an iMac and I set up that my photos and music from my iMac get downloaded to my iPhone.   But now my messages on my iPhone are getting sent to my iMac. I went on my iPhone and clicked Settings  Messages  Send and Recieve but it doesn't show an email that is set up to my Mac. I also can't find preferences for messages on my Mac. How do I stop iMessages from my Phone going to my Mac?  <answer187613> Go to Messages on your Mac, open Preferences (in the menu bar, it's Messages  Preferences), click on Accounts, click on your Apple ID in the list of messaging accounts, and uncheck "Enable this account."
