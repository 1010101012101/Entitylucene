How do I recover lost mail in mail.app on Lion <body> I have lost mail between certain dates for no apparent reason on my imac with Lion using mail.app. Can I find the lost mail and restore it to the respective folders both sent and received?  <comment53542> Did the mail server not deliver the messages or are they stored in a local folder on the mac? <comment53544> What is the email provider? <comment53547> All imap.mbox files are stored in the Library as is usual with the mail.app. Media Temple is the host but they have told me that the mail is not stored with them but locally on the individual computers.
