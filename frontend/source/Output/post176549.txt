Mac partially isolated from the network <body> Since I installed a new access point, I have troubles with only one Mac to access the printer and NAS on my network. Every other computer (Mac or PC) or device (Android or iOS) is working perfectly.   I make a quick sketch on Visio to illustrate how it looks : img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pZLNd.jpg" alt="network"  To resume the situation, we have :  ul liOne router which has a wifi network and DHCP./li liOne printer which is wired to the router./li liOne NAS which is also wired to the router./li liOne Access Point (new one) which is wired to the router. It has no DHCP, and the same SSID + Password as the router's wifi. /li liThree Macbook Air that are using the wifi (A, B and C). /li /ul  The Macbook Air strongB/strong and strongC/strong are connected to the Access Point and are working perfectly. But the Macbook Air strongA/strong, when it's connected to the AP (Conn 1), it cannot see the printer nor the NAS, but it can access internet and access to the router administration page. Other computers can be randomly seen (I believe that the devices on the AP are seen by strongA/strong).   But when the Macbook Air strongA/strong is connected to the router's wifi (Conn 2), everything works perfectly.   I tried to troubleshoot the problem on the Mac's side but also on the AP side. Here's what I checked and tried :   ul liUpgrade or downgrade the AP's firmware - Didn't change anything./li liTry different configurations on the AP - Didn't change anything./li liPut a static IP - Didn't change anything./li liClear the ARP table - Didn't change anything./li liPing the printer or NAS IP - No response./li liScan the entire network - No printer nor NAS seen./li liIs the Mac network configuration correct ? - Yes, 100% sure./li liIs the firewall enabled or misconfigured ? - Nope, disabled./li liIs the Mac up-to-date ? - Yes, every updates have been done. /li /ul  I believe that the problem is coming from the Mac and not the network as the other Macbook Airs are working correctly. But I'm not a Mac expert and I don't really know where else to look. Any advice, idea or solution would be greatly appreciated!  <comment208515> Welcome to Ask Different! Nicely structured question. *I don't know the answer, but wish you luck* <comment208524> Did you try the direct connect (manually), also for test remove the Conn 2 from profile. <comment209359> @Buscarì›ƒ Yes, I tried direct connect but it cannot see other computers. I also removed all connections (Conn 2) and added them again, same result.
