Can anyone confirm whether MacRuby framework shipped with Lion? <body> Somewhere I read that Apple wants to include macruby framework in OS X Lion.   Did they include it?   <answer18072> Here are instructions on how to install MacRuby  http://www.macruby.org/trac/wiki/InstallingMacRuby  <answer18073> Macruby is there as a private framework, and you can call it as such using code. For more elaboration, you should ask your question again on Stackoverflow.   http://redwoodapp.posterous.com/macruby-for-the-desktop-six-reasons  <comment19728> Would you mind if I edited this to remove the opinion / subjective parts? We can't really know if you should or shouldn't do anything - feel free to proclaim to the world that you want to run MacRuby on Lion and would appreciate any tips until the MacRuby website publishes their lion support article. <comment19732> Ok. I want to know need I am to install macruby, or Apple, as promised, (did they promised?) already installed it with Lion. <comment19745> I took a stab at editing it down - I hope you approve and can't wait to see what people do with the framework!
