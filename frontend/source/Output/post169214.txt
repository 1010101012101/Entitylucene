Yosemite Time Machine not backing up (existing and new backups) <body> I am having an issue with Time Machine. Since upgrading to Yosemite Time Machine has not been working. I have seen this seems to be a common issue but have not seen reference to my specific case.  I noticed my backup drive (formatted on Yosemite for backups) was not backing up content (although it said it was). I tried formatting the drive and setting it up as a backup drive again but to no avail.  When I run the backup I get the following message for about 5 seconds, Backing up Zero KB of 1.85 TB, and then it disappears saying finishing backup. Obviously the data is not being backed up for some reason.  I have:  ul liVerified the disk (OK)  /li liRepaired the disk (OK)  /li liFormatted the disk (OK)/li liRe setup time machine (OK)/li /ul  I am running:  ul liYosemite/li liServer 4.0/li liSmbUp/li liExternal Drive with work content (to be backed up)/li liBackups are set for only the external (other drives are excluded)/li /ul
