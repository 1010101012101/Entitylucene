Mount .sparseimage from .bash_profile <body> I need to mount a .sparseimage from .bash_profile but I don't get how to do it. I tried:  precodealias of22='hdiutil attach "Documents/OF.sparseimage" -mountpoint "$HOME/OpenFOAM" &gt; /dev/null ; . $HOME/OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-2.2.0/etc/bashrc' /code/pre  but this gives me:  precodehdiutil: attach failed - no mountable filesystem /code/pre  if I double-click on it or I put it in Startup Items it works (but i need also to source the bashrc after the mount)  What's the problem?   <answer107115> The codeopen(1)/code command can do it:  precode/usr/bin/open /full/path/to/OF.sparseimage /code/pre  <answer136689> In fact, the command you use will mount the disk image, but there are two problems I see.  Before I get into those I want to clarify to all readers (as I had this problem), the following command will mount a disk image:  precodehdiutil attach image_name.sparseimage -mountpoint mount_point /code/pre  where you specify codeimage_name.sparseimage/code and codemount_point/code to your liking.  Here are the problems with your specific case that I see:  1) You are not mounting it in the bash_profile.  You are creating an alias.  You must run the alias first to mount the disk image (with codeof22/code in your case).  2) Seems like you've done #1 because you get the error message "no mountable filesystem".  This is probably because the disk image is using a relative path, which means you must run codeof22/code from the parent directory (which seems to be your home directory in this case).  Try changing the command to   precodehdiutil attach "$HOME/Documents/OF.sparseimage" -mountpoint "$HOME/OpenFOAM" /code/pre  Notice the addition of "$HOME".  <comment125539> Why  /dev/null - perhpas that output might give some info, also what is the error when you type just the hdiutil util in the e terminal and which directory are you in. ie break the command down into iys smaller pieces <comment125542> What output do you see when using: `hdiutil imageinfo Documents/OF.sparseimage`? <comment125552> @EddieKelley  `Resource temporarily unavailable` <comment125553> Is the disk image already attached? Try to unmount it, and then get image info... <comment125639> Why downvote a correct answer? Did I miss something? <comment125677> @EddieKelley I'm sure it's not already mounted ;) <comment125678> As soon as I come back home I Try and I check. <comment125792> Perfect. This works!! :D <comment162226> This doesn't allow the user to specify the mount point.
