How to make the right side of the trackpad of a MacBook Air behave as a right click? <body> I have a MacBook Air running OS X El Capitan. No matter where I click on the built-in trackpad, it behaves as if I am left-clicking. To right-click, I must hold control, then click the trackpad. Is there any way to have the behavior changed, so that if I click in the right half of the trackpad, it behaves as a right click?  <answer269934> I don't know how things are for the track pad preferences on MacBook air but on the MacBook Pro, go to trackpad settings on system preferences and you should see this..  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yoruF.gif" alt="enter image description here"
