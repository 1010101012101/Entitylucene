iPhone restore on iTunes stuck on "Preparing iPhone for Restore" <body> I'm currently using an iPhone 5s.  I downloaded the iOS 11 Public Beta, and after tinkering around for a bit, wanted to downgrade back to iOS 10.3.2, but after trying to restore to iTunes (my first attempt failed), it's now stuck on "Preparing iPhone for restore". It's been like that for about 30 minutes, and I'm starting to get worried. Here's what I did:  ol liDownloaded an IPSW for iOS 10.3.2 specific for my device. (From ipsw.me)/li liUpdated iTunes./li liTurned off Find My iPhone on my device./li liPlugged my device to my computer (I'm on Windows 10)./li liPut my phone on recovery mode./li liChose restore using the downloaded IPSW for iOS 10.3.2./li /ol  Is it safe to unplug my device and restart the process with a different IPSW? I have no problem having to go back to the iOS 11 Beta, I have its IPSW downloading at the moment. I also have the IPSW for iOS 10.3.3 Beta direct from the Apple Beta Program website, will that work?  Thank you!  EDIT1: I also actually have an old iTunes backup that was made around iOS 9.something, would that be a more viable option since its an iTunes backup?  EDIT2: Something weird happened, after leaving the "Preparing iPhone for restore" for a couple of hours, iTunes alerted me of an error. My phone actually got off recovery mode &amp; restarted, but it was still on iOS 11 Beta. Just wanted to update since I haven't seen this happening to other people with similar situations.  <comment364075> Possible duplicate of [iPhone 7 Plus stuck in recovery mode and can't restore/update even in DFU after downgrading from iOS 11](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/287747/iphone-7-plus-stuck-in-recovery-mode-and-cant-restore-update-even-in-dfu-after) Also see https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/286346/downgrade-from-ios-11-beta-to-ios-10-3-2-and-restore-ios-11-backup <comment364076> Sorry for the dumb question... so would I just simply unplug then plug the device to my computer? Since I can't seem to find a "Cancel" button to stop the "restoration".
