Where can you buy Apple earphones? <body> On the Apple store there are EarPods.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ggFZ5.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  And there are In-Ear Headphones.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uwR2v.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  But what if I want to buy the good ol' Earphones?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VRDHH.png" alt="enter image description here"  I find these to be the most comfortable of them all. Apple appears to still produce them, as they are mentioned on the Compare iPod Models page where they are bundled with the iPod Shuffle.  I thought maybe Amazon would work, but apparently OEM does not mean what it used to.  Where can I buy Apple Earphones?  <answer97673> Found lots of places online...   http://m.world-of-accessories.co.uk/genuine-apple-earphones-with-remote-mb770ga-p-1488.html?gclid=COmY79bR2rgCFfLHtAodaR0AvQ  <answer97685> Honestly, I would just buy some off eBay. I prefer the old ones too and have bought some from there before which were genuine.   If you're worried about fakes, look up the seller or look at their feedback.   <comment114622> I'd say you could buy mine, but they've been in my ears.  You don't really want them now. <comment114629> Do you have any reason to believe that those earphones would be more genuine that the ones in the several Amazon OEM listings I linked to? <comment114630> I haven't ordered from them myself but personally yes I think they look legit. And there not 4usd.
