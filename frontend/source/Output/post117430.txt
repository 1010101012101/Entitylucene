Mac OS announcing notifications <body> There is an option in Mac OS to announce alerts, when they are displayed or to have it announce the time in regular intervals.  My question is: Is there an option to announce notifications, or even better a way to select which app's notifications should be announced?  <answer117460> Unfortunately, no.  The Notification system doesn't support Text-To-Speech and it's not supported by Accessibility.  <answer117471> With regard to speaking notifications, this does not appear to be possible in OS X 10.9, Mavericks. Please take the opportunity ask for this feature via Apple's feedback page.  You can however have the time announced at regular intervals. The setting is in the strongDate &amp; Time/strong panel of strongSystem Preferences/strong:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Iz0vO.png" alt="Date and Time"
