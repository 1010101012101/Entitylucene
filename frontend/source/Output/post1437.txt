How can one invoke a keyboard shortcut from within an AppleScript? <body> I need to invoke a keyboard shortcut from within an AppleScript code, later to be used as a startup item (i.e. the alternative to having to press something at every log in).  <answer1439> I get the impression that what you're trying to do is a copy command (i.e., kbd⌘C/kbd)—am I right?  Here's an example from one of my scripts:  precodetell application "System Events"     tell application "Microsoft Entourage" to activate     tell menu "Edit" of menu bar item "Edit" of menu bar 1 of process "Microsoft Entourage"         click menu item "Select All"         click menu item "Copy"     end tell     key code 123 end tell /code/pre  That is, I script the menu command instead of scripting shortcuts.  You might also take a look and see if you have code/Library/Scripts/UI Element Scripts/Key Down-Up.applescript/code, which should give you alternate ideas of how to emulate keyboard actions.  And of course, there are a lot of examples in code/Library/Scripts//code and code~/Library/Scripts//code, many of which are worth a look in general.  <answer83825> For example, you can do :  precodetell application "System Events"     keystroke "c" using command down     keystroke "v" using {option down, command down} end tell /code/pre  To press : kbdcmd/kbd+kbdC/kbd and then kbdcmd/kbd+kbdalt/kbd+kbdV/kbd
