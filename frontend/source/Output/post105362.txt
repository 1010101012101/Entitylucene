iPad Car Charging <body> I am wanting to charge my iPad in the DC port in my car. I have already got a USB car charger for my iPhone and that works fine. When I put my iPad into it it says "Not Charging." Can anyone tell me why it won't charge?  <answer105386> You will be better off purchasing a car charger that is rated for use with the iPad. Try checking with the Apple Store.  <answer105387> The not charging indicates that when the iPad is running, the remaining current from your adapter won't be adding much meaningful charge to the battery.  See -  iPad displays &quot;Not Charging&quot; when plugged into USB ports.  What can I do?  When you turn off the screen and idle the CPU, the charge rate will go up when the iPad is on, but you'll want a higher current charger or to power off the iPad if you want to maximize the current that goes to the charging circuitry as opposed to running the iPad.  <comment123873> http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/43651/how-much-ma-does-an-ipad-need-to-be-charged <comment123901> http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/274/ipad-displays-not-charging-when-plugged-into-usb-ports-what-can-i-do
