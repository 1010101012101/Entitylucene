Can't install Sierra on triple boot MacBook Pro with rEFInd <body> I have downloaded Sierra from App Store and tried to install but I am not able to select a disk. I have installed rEFInd on my MacBook Pro and have triple boot (Mac OS X, Windows 10 and Ubuntu). How can I install it?  My Mac info: MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015) - El Capitan  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5USGY.png" alt="macOS Installer - Select Disk"  After several reboots I was not able to see coderEFInd/code menu. So I have tried to reinstall. Here is the reinstall output:  precodeShimSource is none Installing rEFInd on OS X....

I have used codeParagon Disk Manager for Mac/code and deleted my linux partitions, main and swap.  strongUPDATE 2:/strong  I have also deleted my bootcamp partition.

I have disabled it and managed to install codeSierra/code.  <answer257354> It's because ReIfind doesn't work with Sierra  <comment318434> I have both tried with USB thumb and installer from App Store and same result with one difference: When I first tried with USB I have managed to select the drive Macintosh HD but installer asked password for unlocking the drive. I have entered my account password but encountered same screen that I shared. <comment318435> Perhaps I shuld do something with rEFInd. <comment318439> @klanomath I have eadded. <comment321308> Welcome to Ask Different.

If disabling FileVault turned out to be the solution, you should add it as an "Answer" to your question. But, was this after you nuked all of your partitions? Do you know if there's a chance to preserve all of the other OSes?
