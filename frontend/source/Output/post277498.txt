MacTex Upgrade from 2015 to 2016 <body> I wish to migrate from using MacTex 2015 to MacTex 2016 on my Mac. I have Sierra installed on my Laptop. I wish to know if:   ol liInstalling MacTex will overwrite my old MacTex or retain it (I actually want it overwritten!)?/li liIf it does not overwrite, then what measures should be taken to completely remove the older version and switch to the 2016 version?/li /ol  I am asking these questions since the explanation provided on www.tug.org/mactex is not sufficiently clear, and it add more to the confusion.   <answer277504> Installing MacTeX 2016 will create a new code2016/code directory in code/usr/local/texlive//code with all of TeX and friends in it. It will also update all symlinks etc. to point to the new versions. So you can run codesudo rm -rf /usr/local/texlive/2015/code afterwards to remove the old version. This will lead to some broken links in code/Library/TeX/code but I never bothered with cleaning them up and they won't be used anyway.  <comment349264> You are running Sierra, I assume? <comment349272> The above answer is correct.  I have both 2014 and 2015 MacTex installed on my computer.  Eventually, I will delete the 2014 version.
