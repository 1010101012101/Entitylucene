iTerm2, unicode and sympy <body> In my both Mac (OS X Mavericks) and Ubuntu machine, I have installed sympy that is a python library for symbolic mathematics. Part of codesympy/code is the pretty print functionality that uses unicode characters to prettify symbolic expressions in the command-line environments with unicode support. For example, in my Ubuntu machine and in its codegnome-terminal/code running the following code  precodefrom sympy import * x = Symbol("x") pprint(Integral(sqrt(1/x), x))  /code/pre  renders to   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8MgVq.png" alt="enter image description here"  However, the same command in OS X with iTerm2 (that should support unicode) results in   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FXnMA.png" alt="enter image description here"  I'm using codesympy 0.7.5/code that I have made from source with the latest build of codeiTerm2/code (Build 1.0.0.20140518). Is there anything that I miss here? The lead developer of sympy is one of the StackExchange network. It would be great to know his opinion on this one.   <answer135541> Make sure your terminal in the iTerm preferences - Profiles - Terminal supports Unicode (the character encoding should be "Unicode (UTF-8)". SymPy will choose ASCII if the terminal does not report that it supports Unicode.   <answer135593> I finally found out what the problem is. The problem was emnot/em with the terminal emulators themselves as both codeOSX Terminal/code and codeiTerm2/code were using codeUTF-8/code by default. It turned out one has to inform python explicitly that the terminal is capable of handling unicode by way of   precodeexport PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8 /code/pre  Credits to this stackoverflow answer.  <comment160632> At this moment running your example through [live.sympy.org](http://live.sympy.org) throws a lot of unicode errors - maybe there is a general issue with the most recent build? <comment160643> @Asmus what do you mean Unicode errors? If it doesn't render correctly, that is an issue with your browser or the font that it is using. <comment160648> Thank you for reply. I'm afraid that is not the problem. In both iTerm2 and Terminal I have `UTF-8` as character encoding and yet it's not working. <comment160663> @asmeurer I tried copy&pasting the above three python lines directly into the browser session (Safari) and had the following output: `Exception in SymPy Live of type  type 'exceptions.UnicodeEncodeError'` [. . . ] `UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\u2320' in position 0: ordinal not in range(128)`. I can send you the whole error output if you like. <comment160667> @Asmus if you could open an [issue](https://github.com/sympy/sympy-live/issues/new) for it that would be great. I can't reproduce it myself. <comment160668> @asmeurer The issue can now be [found here](https://github.com/sympy/sympy-live/issues/87) <comment160827> Interesting, I've never heard of this environment variable. I wonder if this is a situation that is handled better by Python 3. <comment266819> This didn't work for me. Even tried Python 3 in the hopes that it might just work, but it didn't.
