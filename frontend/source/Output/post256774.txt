"Low Power Sleep" when battery still has a good amount of charge <body> I have a MacBook Pro (Retina, Mid 2012) running Sierra (16A323). Recently the laptop goes to sleep when I still have 30-35% of battery remaining. The logs show:  precode2016-10-11 07:14:01 +0100 Wake  Wake from Standby [CDNVA] due to EC.LidOpen/Lid Open: Using BATT (Charge:35%) 32 secs 2016-10-11 07:14:33 +0100 Sleep Entering Sleep state due to 'Low Power Sleep': Using Batt (Charge:35%) 891 secs 2016-10-11 07:29:24 +0100 Wake  Wake from Hibernate [CDNVA] due to /User: Using AC (Charge:34%) /code/pre  You can see in the middle line that the reported battery level is 35%.  The battery condition is reported as "Normal".  Is there a way to reset macOS thinks is a low battery level?  I've always been slightly disappointed in the battery life on this machineâ€¦ are there known issues with the battery on this model?
