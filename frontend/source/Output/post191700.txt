Finder no longer keep tabs after restart in Yosemite <body> My preference is working with one Finder window with multiple tabs. So previously the Finder could memorize the tabs and reopen them both after I close/reopen the window and after I restart the Yosemite, no matter if I check the "reopen the apps" box or not in the restart dialog box. But now it couldn't do this any more. What it does now when I close/reopen the window or restart the OS X is only memorize and reopen one last tab in the widow before the reopen or restart. I have tried with several options, including delete the Finder saved state file in the Library and execute the "defaults write com.apple.finder NSQuitAlwaysKeepsWindows -bool true" command. None of them worked.  Any idea how I can go back to the previous state?
