How can I restore deleted contacts from iPhone 4s? <body> My wife and I both have 4s models and we both downloaded iOS 7 and now we have all contacts (hers and mine) on both phones. I started to delete some of hers on my phone and it deleted the same contacts on her phone automatically. How can I restore her contacts?  <answer115026> The deleted and lost iPhone contacts can be recovered in 2 ways: recover from iPhone directly or restore from iTunes backup copy.  <answer130577> I was just looking to fix the same problem. All of a sudden my contacts were gone/empty. Been lazy and never set up iCloud. So all these other suggestions weren't going to work.  What I ended up doing  ul liDouble tap home button/li liHold down on an icon that appears on bottom of screen and close all running apps/li liTap home button again/li liPower off your phone/li liTurn phone back on/li liOpen contacts and they should be restored./li /ul  Hope this works for you and any one else with the same problem. I'm off to go back up my phone to a computer and the cloud.  <comment153081> This seems to be a solution to another problem than the one described in the question.
