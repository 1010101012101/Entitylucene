Convert XPS to PDF <body> I have been given an XPS file which seems to be readily opened only on Windows based machines. I was under the impression that I could use Acrobat Pro to convert the file to PDF, but it doesn't seem to be the case. Is there:  ol liA way to use Acrobat Pro to do this conversion?/li liA recommended FOSS mechanism?/li liA good recommendation for an XPS viewer?/li /ol  Thanks!  <answer213341> If you have a gmail account it will open and display XPS documents. Also there is an XPS-Reader application on the Mac app store.  <answer213758> GraphicConverter will open XPS files  Xee will open the preview image embedded in them but not the image itself, at least the ones I just tested.  <comment257945> Thanks! The GMail trick is actually really good.
