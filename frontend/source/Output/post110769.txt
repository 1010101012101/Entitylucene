What does Control key do, other than its usage in terminal and right click? <body> So far I have been using control key to:  ul liSend control commands to terminal/li liOccasionally do right click/li /ul  Does the key have any other function?  <answer110770> kbdCtrl/kbd it is a level 3 modifier key. You could have a look at what it does if you show the virtual keyboard. It also gives you some more combinations of shortcuts.  <answer110800> The kbdControl/kbd key is used as a modifier for various purposes in different applications. In OS X, it is also used for Emacs bindings supported in many applications.  The Apple HIG (Human Interface Guidelines) that is recommended for application developers discourages the use of the kbdControl/kbd key (the closest equivalent to the kbdControl/kbd modifier key in Windows is the kbdCommand/kbd key on OS X):     strongAs much as possible, avoid using the Control key./strong Because the Control key is already used by some of the universal access features—as well as in Cocoa text fields where Emacs-style key bindings are often used—it should be used as a modifier key only when necessary.

But here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_key you see some combos listed. Under Mac OS X, the Control key allows the use of Emacs-style key combinations in most text entry fields. For example, Ctrl-A moves the caret to the start of the paragraph, Ctrl-L vertically centers the current line in the editing field, Ctrl-K cuts text to the end of the line to a kill ring separate from the normal clipboard, etc. <comment130449> awesome, thanks! <comment348154> Thank you for this.  I find it funny that there is a page down shortcut of Control+v but not one for page up.  Is this correct?  I find most of these shorcuts not to be useful surprisingly.
