cfgutil no longer works via ssh after upgrading to Sierra <body> I use the codecfgutil/code from Apple Configurator with iOS devices on an OSX host via SSH. After upgrading to Sierra, I get a NSCocoaErrorDomain message and it fails. It works fine at the terminal, however.  Here's my output of trying it successfully at a local terminal, then sshing and the failure:  precode~ cfgutil list Type: [...] ECID: [...] UDID: [...] Location: [...] Name: [...] ~  ssh localhost /usr/local/bin/cfgutil list Password: cfgutil: error: Error Domain=NSCocoaErrorDomain Code=4097 "connection to service named com.apple.configurator.xpc.InternetService" UserInfo={NSDebugDescription=connection to service named com.apple.configurator.xpc.InternetService} /code/pre  I assume this comes from some increased security measures from Sierra, but for me it's a pain. Any ideas how to disable this or work around it?  <answer278564> I've found a very awkward workaround, though input is hidden:  ul liCreate a file, e.g. code/tmp/cfgutil.sh/code on the server/li liPopulate that file with the command you wish to run, e.g. codecfgutil list/code/li liWhen you ssh in, run codeopen -a Terminal /tmp/cfgutil.sh/code/li /ul  Here's a minimal example: codeecho "/usr/local/bin/cfgutil list" &gt; /tmp/cfgutil.sh &amp;&amp; ssh localhost open -a Terminal "/tmp/cfgutil.sh"/code  I suspect it only works if the user is logged in via the UI as well.  <answer278960> I've found a slightly better workaround now:  precodesudo /bin/launchctl asuser 0 cfgutil list /code/pre  Don't ask me how it works, but I get expected output.  <comment324111> I see the same thing, too...
