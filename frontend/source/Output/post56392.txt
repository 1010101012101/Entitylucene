Print with blank first page? <body> I frequently have to print a 3-page document.  Wanting to save paper, I print it 2-to-a-page, double-sided.  So I end up with the front having "1 | 2", and the back having "3 |  ".  It'd be more convenient if the front had " | 1", and the back had "2 | 3".  Is there a way to have Mac OS X printing insert a blank page at the start when printing?  <answer56394> Hmmm probably not the way you want it. You don't mention what are you trying to print (Word? Pages? TextEdit?), If you use Pages, for example,  you could create a template that inserts a page break in the 1st page (at the beginning), so your real 1st page would be the 2nd page. Then use that template as your "blank document".   I know, simple solution but works ;)  strongUPDATE/strong Since you need to usually add a blank page to a PDF, you can use preview for that. Position yourself in the first page and do an:   Edit - Insert Blank Page  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dKRYH.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment64722> It's never a document I made, so a template with a blank first page is a good idea but not really an option here.  Usually it's a PDF (from Preview), or a .doc (from LibreOffice).  In the latter case, I can insert a page-break before printing, but I don't think Preview can do that. <comment64723> Yes, preview can do that, open the PDF in question and go to Edit - Insert Blank Page <comment64762> Wow, I totally missed that.  (Maybe because it's oddly dimmed in some cases, like when a .doc is open.)  Thanks!
