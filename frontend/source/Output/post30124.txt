How can I put a Lion installer on a Flash Drive? <body> Could someone please list the steps to make a backup Lion install on a flash drive? Is it as simple as copying the Lion installer?  <answer30126> Your best bet is to follow the instructions on this page.  Things you'll need:  ul liFlash drive bigger than 4 GB (8 GB+ would be best)/li liInstallESD.dmg (extracted from the OS X Lion App, if you've saved it prior to the upgrade)/li /ul  There's an alternate method mentioned here.  strongNote/strong: If you don't have the  Lion Install App, follow the instructions on this page to download it again.  <comment34588> Thanks, great pointers. The problem with the first method - for me - is that I don't have the SL base system. I could rebuild one, but I'm lazy. The problem with the second solution is that it's obviously dicey. Maybe I will just buy the Apple dongle... <comment35476> DON'T buy the Apple dongleâ€¦ it's a terrible deal. It's expensive, it doesn't create a recovery partition, and it won't let you re-download from the Mac App Store if you need to later. Also, if you buy a new Mac in a year, it probably won't work with that either. <comment35477> If, as you suggest below, your question is really "How to make a Lion installer if I don't have a Mac with (at least) Snow Leopard on it?" then that is a very different question.
