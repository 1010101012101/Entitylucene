Connect Macbook Pro Late 2016 with monitor DELL UP2516D <body> I just received as Christmas present a Macbook Pro 15" Late 2016 with also a DELL UP2516D monitor that my friends said I should connect with the former.  The point is that I am not a computer expert as this is my first laptop and I really don't know how can I connect these two devices.  The DELL monitor comes with the following ports (product description):   precodeDP, mDP, 2 x HDMI (MHL), 4 x USB3 with one charging port, 2 x USB3 upstream /code/pre  and the MacBook Pro has got only the codeUSB-c/code ports.  How do I connect my MacBook with USB-C ports to the Dell Monitor?  <answer267722> You'll need a dongle to go from USB-C to either: HDMI, DP/mDP. At this time they're on discount from Apple since they're new, so you'll want to buy the dongle now.  Here's a full list of Apple's UCB-C dongle choices, it's a good page to review: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204360  And here is a multi-port display adapter from Apple, which provides HDMI+USB-A+USB-C, so it may be a best bet for some folks: http://www.apple.com/shop/product/MJ1K2AM/A/usb-c-digital-av-multiport-adapter  <comment335884> https://www.apple.com/thunderbolt/ <comment335897> Please visit the site in my previous comment, scroll way down and click on the plus below "See how to connect your devices" <comment335898> so in your opinion should I buy this one http://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/MMEL2ZM/A/thunderbolt-3-usb-c-to-thunderbolt-2-adapter?fnode=8b ? <comment335899> Given that your monitor doesn't seem to have a Thunderbolt port this might not be the best option. HDMI should work much better. <comment335900> You just need to go from USB-C to DisplayPort or mini DisplayPort   - this is a [good option](https://goo.gl/DcfMwu) <comment335902> great! thanks guys...just bought this https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B01EXKDRAC/ref=od_aui_detailpages00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 <comment335976> No problem.
