Why are (Pages for Mac) templates, in the Library folder different than what's available in Pages? <body> Mac's Page's templates seem to be stored in:   LibraryApplication SupportiWorkPagesTemplatesMy Templates  However, when I use Pages and wish to choose a template, what's available is different than what's in the Library folder.   Can anyone explain this discrepancy?   Thank you.   <answer242652> The pre-installed templates are stored within the application bundle. You find them by right-clicking the Pages application in the Applications folder and choosing 'Show Package Contents…', then navigating into the subfolder Contents—Resources—Templates.  The 'MyTemplates' folder is meant as a standard folder for templates you create yourself.   (based on Pages 4.3)  <comment298585> What version of Mac OS X are you running on your Mac? What version of Pages are you having problems with? In which Library folder are you looking: Macintosh HD/Users/your_username/Library/Application Support... or Macintosh HD/Library/Application Support....?
