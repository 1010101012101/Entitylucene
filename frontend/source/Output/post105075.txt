TextMate recover after kernel panic <body> I was working on an unsaved file when the kernel suddenly got a panic attack. I have the 'Save files when focus is lost" checkbox checked, and I frequently switched between textmate and the browser, so plenty of oppurtunities to autosave there. I don't see any autosaved documents in my 'recently opened documents'. Is there any chance I can get my work back?  <answer105131> The file was located in: strong~/Library/Application Support/TextMate/Session//strong  This is for the OpenSource version of TextMate 2.0-alpha-9487, on osx Mountain Lion 1.8.5  <comment123580> Did you look in the terminal if there is a hidden files  that may be a autosave of you document. `ls -a` lists all files including the hidden ones. <comment123589> I have hidden files visible in the finder. In which directory should I be looking? <comment123614> Are you using the OpenSource version of TextMate, if not which version are you using? <comment123624> Which Textmate version and which OSX? I know the OP didn't specify his, but it would be useful anyway to specify yours. <comment123629> @Lohoris that is why I asked about his version of TextMate.
