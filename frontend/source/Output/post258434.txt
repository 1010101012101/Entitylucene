iPad keeps asking for Apple id login <body> My iPad 2 keeps asking for my Apple id and cloud id, cleared safari hx, reset my iPad. I was contacted by Apple that my id was reset by a ie on a windows pc. Changed my Apple id from my iPhone. iPad keeps asking for Apple id and icloud id. I believe I have a virus on my iPad. Suggestions?  <answer258507> First reset your iPad: Settings  general  reset  Erase all content and settings.  Then go to icloud.com and click on reset password and reset your password to something complicated and not at all similar to the old password.  Now set up your iPad as a new device emnot from a backup/em (which may have the presumed virus) and sign into iCloud with your new password.  Keep an eye on it and watch for unusual activity on your icloud account.  Then take your time setting up your accounts and re-downloading your apps on the iPad.  Yeah I would do it that way rather than restoring from backup, it's a PITA but you'll have a clean iPad.  <comment323055> How did apple contact you?  I'm highly suspicious of THAT.. Unless it was an email telling you to visit appleid.apple.com or iforgot.apple.com then I doubt the "contact" was really from apple.
