Wireless headphones on a MacBook running 10.4 — Does Bluetooth work? <body> Can MacBooks (10.4) stream music to Bluetooth headphones? If not, is my only other option to purchase bulky/expensive wireless headphones, or is there another way?  <answer29100> Yep, Bluetooth works. Take a look a this :) A bit expensive, but I'm sure there are a lot of alternatives around.  <answer29103> The Bluetooth profile necessary for stereo audio, A2DP, is supported by OS X since version 10.5 (aka “Leopard”). As you use 10.4 (aka “Tiger”), the answer to the first part of your question is:  strongBluetooth audio only works in 64 kbit/s mono quality via the headset profile in 10.4./strong  Probably not what you want for music listening, even if the headphones support it. As to the second part of your question:  strongYou are stuck with wireless solutions working via the audio jack, USB or FireWire./strong  In the case of USB / FW solutions (if such wireless solutions exist), check these for 10.4 compatibility before you invest.  <comment33432> OP is on 10.4. A2DP was added in 10.5. See my answer – essentially, for OP, Bluetooth music does **not** work. <comment33438> Ok, my honnest mistake. You were right!
