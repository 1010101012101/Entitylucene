Can I turn off the alternate keyboards in Messages <body> When I rotate my iPhone while in Messages, a totally different input area appears. I never use this, can I turn it off?  <answer276636> Assuming you're talking about the Handwriting Input panel in iOS 10:  Rotate the phone to show the input area, then tap the keyboard icon, showing the keyboard, and it will keep the setting.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iIwRD.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Image / info via: https://www.gottabemobile.com/how-to-turn-off-the-5-most-annoying-ios-10-features/  <comment348224> Thank you! I didn't know what this was called so my Google-fu failed. <comment352994> Related: https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/253798/how-do-i-turn-off-drawing-mode-in-ios-10s-messages/263655
