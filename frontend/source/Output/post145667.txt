To change default map application in iPhone <body> Apple Maps are very inaccurate. They costs my time and money when I use them by accident.  I want to change the default app to Google Maps.   strongHow can you change the default Map application in the newest iOS to Google Maps?/strong  I really would like to delete the Apple Maps from my phone.  <answer145669> strongYou can't change the default app./strong Some apps give you the option to choose which app to open maps/directions in, but this varies per app and app developer. There is no system toggle and Safari/Siri/etc will continue to open maps in Maps.  <answer168258> Map links from Google Applications in iOS should open in Google Maps: Chrome, Gmail, etc.  <answer168437> In Chrome, if you visit a Google Maps link, it will open in the Google Maps app. This does not, however, change default app registration.   <answer169143> That is correct, you cannot change the default app across other apps. This Google app affinity is only available amongst their apps.  <answer290873> As of iOS 10 you can delete the iPhone maps application. If you click on a Google Calendar destination, you will then get a message saying the Maps app is missing. Ignore that message. Hold down a finger on the address, select copy, open Google Maps and paste the address you just copied. This saves a few key strokes and it works.   <comment171702> If this is true, I will change my phone model to some other which has good design. <comment171704> If it is not changing, my next phone will not be iPhone. <comment197493> please explain, with details <comment197825> This is not exactly what I was asking for. The default application is what binds to Contacts, for instance. The problem in iPhone is that you cannot change this thing. <comment345226> Horrible Apple policy.
