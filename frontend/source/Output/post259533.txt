Re-enable GMail access on iPhone and mac from 3rd party apps? <body> I have several gmail accounts and they worked just fine. I am using 3rd party email client. It worked fine on both iPhone and MacBook Pro.  Yesterday I wanted to test some more email apps. I tried few. Then stupid Google decided to disable access to strongany/strong 3rd party app to GMail!!!  I tried:  ul liseveral 3rd party apps/li lire-add accounts/li lireset captcha on device/li li2 factor auth is off/li lirebooting device/li lireinstalling 3rd party app/li lirevoking app in google account settings/li lipermissions for 3rd party app are set ok/li /ul  Funny thing, using GMail IOS app works! And any 3rd point app is NOT working.  I am very very very very frustrated with google.  Do you have any idea how I can re-enable my access to GMail from 3rd party apps? Did I tried to login too much times? How to fix that?
