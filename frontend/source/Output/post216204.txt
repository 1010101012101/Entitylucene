/usr/bin Permission change <body> I am trying to set up Java on Xcode and it needs to access /usr/bin/java at some point. But I cannot get hold of this folder and I get this message: The folder “java” can’t be opened because you don’t have permission to see its contents.   Even when I try to reach the permission through Get Info the system does not open the folder because of the same restriction.  I think it is possible to change the permission through Terminal but I am afraid to blow up something on my Mac. How can I change the permission safely?  <answer216243> em/usr/bin/java/em is no valid folder in any installation or version of Java (I know of).  Instead the file em/usr/bin/java/em is a symlink to em/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/A/Commands/java/em installed by the default Apple Java installer (v1.6.x).  The Oracle Java installer (either JDK/SDK or JRE) is installed to /Library/Java.  <comment261250> It is OSX 10.9 and Java is already installed. I can run Java code on my mac through Terminal. Using the Terminal the /usr/bin/Java is totally valid directory
