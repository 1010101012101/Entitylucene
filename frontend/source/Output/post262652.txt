iBooks preview is not dynamically scaling for devices, what am I doing wrong? <body> Making my first iBook and my preview is not scaling when I export to my phone. It appears in iPad size, text doesn't scale, etc. Same thing happens when I export for mac view, if I shrink the window, instead of the text size scaling, the whole page will scale. Have I forgotten a checkbox in iBooks somewhere? What have I done wrong?
