FileVault doesn't correctly install itself <body> I am trying to enable FileVault on OSX Mavericks, on a mid-2010 MBP.  Some backstory/history: Laptop had the original machine hard drive (old spinning disk). This had FileVault enabled without problems.  I replaced the old spinning disk with a new 250GB SSD, and re-installed from scratch. I set this drive up in a newer MBP (mid-2011), so I could work on the old one while setting up the new one, then swapped the drive into the old laptop.  After swapping the SSD from the mid-2011 MBP into the mid-2010 MBP, I had a bunch of random errors (lots of 'signal 4' errors when starting Apache and other system components). These were sporadic and appeared random, so I eventually used the OSX Mavericks recovery partition to do a repair re-installation of Mavericks.  After this re-install, I setup the missing settings, and have been working fine since then,  However, I've tried to setup FileVault twice now, and both times the following has happened:  ul liI enable FileVault, choose not to store the key with Apple (business policy), and write down the recovery key./li liI confirm that I am happy for FileVault to restart the laptop once it's done. The 'Cancel' and 'Restart' buttons go blank, (so I now can't close System Preferences unless I force-quit it), but the machine never restarts./li /ul  I find the attached in the Console app from around the same time, not sure if any of it is related:  pre7/04/14 19:22:12.103 com.apple.preference.security.remoteservice[4153]: ==== EFILoginCopyUserGraphics name:Matt Peel userPictureData:yes 7/04/14 19:22:14.000 kernel[0]: hfs: mounted Recovery HD on device disk0s3 7/04/14 19:22:14.644 mds[87]: (Normal) Volume: volume:0x7fa1528c8000 ********** Bootstrapped Creating a default store:0 SpotLoc:(null) SpotVerLoc:(null) occlude:0 /Volumes/Recovery HD 7/04/14 19:22:14.749 fseventsd[44]: Logging disabled completely for device:1: /Volumes/Recovery HD 7/04/14 19:22:15.000 kernel[0]: hfs: unmount initiated on Recovery HD on device disk0s3 7/04/14 19:22:16.153 ReportCrash[6802]: DebugSymbols was unable to start a spotlight query: spotlight is not responding or disabled. 7/04/14 19:22:16.687 com.apple.launchd[1]: (com.apple.diskmanagementd[4154]) Job appears to have crashed: Segmentation fault: 11 7/04/14 19:22:16.966 ReportCrash[6802]: Saved crash report for diskmanagementd[4154] version 744.1 to /Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/diskmanagementd_2014-04-07-192216_m.crash 7/04/14 19:22:28.845 login[4911]: DEAD_PROCESS: 4911 ttys002 7/04/14 19:22:30.766 login[1682]: DEAD_PROCESS: 1682 ttys000 7/04/14 19:22:42.923 J8RPQ294UB.com.skitch.SkitchHelper[191]: XPC_ERROR_CONNECTION_INVALID 7/04/14 19:22:45.300 login[6866]: USER_PROCESS: 6866 ttys000 7/04/14 19:22:45.771 login[6866]: DEAD_PROCESS: 6866 ttys000 7/04/14 19:22:48.931 org.macosforge.xquartz.startx[1032]: /opt/X11/bin/xinit: connection to X server lost 7/04/14 19:22:48.931 org.macosforge.xquartz.startx[1032]:  7/04/14 19:22:49.141 playonmac.real[577]: CoreText performance note: Client called CTFontCreateWithName() using name "Lucida Grande" and got font with PostScript name "LucidaGrande".

If I manually close System Preferences and restart the laptop, I get the FileVault screen where I can enter my password to unlock the drive. I then can login to my laptop as usual. If I come back into the FileVault preferences, however, it says that FileVault is still turned off.  <comment148445> You might want to try updating your question by not writing sentences containing more than 1 comma. It's hard to read. -- The last sentence contains 4 of them. Split it up please. <comment148478> How much data is on the drive that is to be encrypted? Is the mac running any sort of server functions? Have you done this after a fresh reboot and not running any 3PP apps? <comment180466> @AndrewU. Around 180GB. The Mac runs software like Apache, Nginx, MySQL. Have tried it after a fresh reboot, and also after shutting down those sorts of apps. <comment247264> Since you point to this date.timestamp: `7/04/14 19:22:42.923 J8RPQ294UB.com.skitch.SkitchHelper` I would suggest that you test by disabling the Skitch helper process by running Skitch  Preferences  General and un-tick the `Keep Skitch Helper running in the background...` setting.
