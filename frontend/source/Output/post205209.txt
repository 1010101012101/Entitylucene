Wrong name on Mail app <body> I'm using Yosemite and I've added my codeGoogle account/code to my codeInternet Accounts/code and when I receive emails to that account the name is displayed as codeHolidays in New Zealand/code. This is somehow funny and wrong.   Just when I disable the codeCalendar/code item under my codeInternet Accounts &gt; Google/code my email is displayed right on Mail.  All my details under codeMail/code (Full Name, etc) are right.  How can I still have my Calendar linked and my name displayed under my Mail  app?  <answer206407> i had the same issue with the exact same name, its amusing by feels somewhat intrusive   I think i have fixed it by clicking the drop down menu by "Holidays in New Zealand" and clicking 'remove from previous recipients list'   hope this helps
