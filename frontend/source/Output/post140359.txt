How do I merge folders using finder? <body> I have a folder (let's name it main-folder and it's mounted via smb) that contains lots of files and subfolders. I want to copy half of the contents of main-folder to a local subfolder (let's call it my-folder). My problem is that one folder is common between main-folder and my-folder. And even though I have pressed the option key, I do not get the merge option.  I know I can use rsync and other similar commands which I've done lots of time. EXCEPT I can't use it this time as I am only copying half of the files/folders. Too tedious to write an exception list.  strongI was hoping for a similar behaviour when dragging files/folders in Windows Explorer./strong  Any ideas on how to make it work? Thanks a lot  <answer140386> Just hold the Option button when you drag the folder, then will be available the "Keep Both"/"Combine" option so you can merge the folders. Just like the Windows default behavior.  Where did folder &quot;merge&quot; or &quot;keep both&quot; go in OS X 10.9 Mavericks?
