Finding videos in iCloud <body> Do the videos you take on iPhone go to the iCloud? If so where do I find them on my computer? It didn't go where my pictures are.  <answer60287> No they don't get moved to the iCloud. At least not automatically. There is a feature called Photo Stream which does exactly that with photos. But there isn't a Video Stream (yet).  subNote that iCloud embackups/em do backup your videos (and hence go to iCloud), however, they are not user accessible (except in restoring an iDevice)./sub  <comment69540> How do I get a 2minute video to my computer? <comment69541> I want to be able to email it but my phone won't let me without shortening it.
