Is the performance of Lion + SSD + Filevault2 good enough for a system primarily used for application developemnt? <body> I'm looking to buy a MacBook Pro w/ SSD.  I was wondering if anyone out there has noticed any significant performance drop with FileVault2 enabled for the following tasks:  ol liSmall (under 2 GB) PostgreSQL and MySQL databases/li liRuby development/li liLots of grepping and text parsing/li /ol  <answer37691> As you will buy one of the latest Macs, you should be fine.  The used Intel processors support strongIntelÂ® Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)/strong which is also used in Filevault 2.  Ars Technica, published an extended review on Filvault 2 in Lion. They say:     Apple also leverages the special-purpose AES instructions and hardware on Intel's newest CPUs, further reducing the CPU overhead. The end result is that regular users will be stronghard-pressed to notice any reduction in performance/strong with encryption enabled.   strongEdit:/strong  These are real world numbers from my MBP with an Intel 2635QM processor which supports AES encryption. My hard drive is a Crucial M4 128GB.  ul liFilevault 2 disabled: strongmax. read 510MB/s/strong, write: I forgot to write this down :(/li liFilevault 2 enabled: strongmax. read 490MB/s/strong, write: 190MB/s/li /ul  I mention only the max. numbers as these figures depend on different factors for file operations. The difference for maximum read here is 20MB/s abosolutely which is strong4%/strong relatively.  <answer72351> I'm pretty sure your usage pattern is going to determine your perception of whether performance is a big hit.  I'm doing Rails development on a 2012 rMBP-13" with 512SSD, 8GB RAM and FileVault 2 enabled. My co-worker has a 2012 rMBP-13" with 768SSD, 8GB RAM and FileVault 2 disabled.  Running the same suite of unit tests (which are db heavy), mine complete in 70s, while hers complete in 55s, about a 22% difference.  In regular use (opening browser, files, email, etc.) the machines seem to perform about the same.  <comment42769> When the disk is encrypted, the CPU becomes the bottleneck. Using Intel AES standards should compensate most of the deficits. Still, I admit that it would be nice to have real world numbers to point to. <comment44432> I have real word numbers! I have real world numbers! See the edited answer :)
