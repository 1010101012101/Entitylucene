How to create a password protected ad-hoc network on Yosemite <body> I just tried to create an ad-hoc network on OS X Yosemite and noticed there are no password options. Are they hidden? If so, is there any way to enable them? Is Terminal an option?   Is it possible to create a password protected ad-hoc network on yosemite? If so, how?  <answer182779> You can create a password-protected ad-hoc network by sharing your internet connection. To do so:  ol liGo to Apple Menu - System Preferences/li liGo to Sharing preference pane/li liSelect "Internet Sharing"/li liChoose the source port/li liSet your connection to be broadcast over WiFi/li liClick on WiFi options and set a network name and security/li /ol  While this is a little more involved than just creating the ad-hoc, it will serve the same purpose as well as having the benefit of sharing your connection. At this time, there is no way to add security to an ad-hoc only network on Yosemite.  Source  <comment217747> Thank you(+1), that's handy to know. Unfortunately I can't share a WiFi connection to WiFi :( <comment217749> @GeorgeProfenza True :( <comment231274> "WiFi options" is grayed out on Yosemite (2012 MBP Retina), FWIW. Might work on newer macs?
