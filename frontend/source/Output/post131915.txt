Find lost photos that show in screen saver <body> Wonderful older photos that aren't in my library show up on my screen saver. I would love to be able to get to them! I currently use 10.9.3, but this has been happening for a long time.  <answer131922> Photos in the screen saver come from the source that is selected in strongSystem Preferences/strong â†’ strongDesktop &amp; Screen Saver/strong. This means that your missing photos will be in whatever source has been selected there.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DQdXx.png" width="283"
