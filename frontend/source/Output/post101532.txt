What's the difference between the battery of iPhone 5s vs iPhone 5? <body> Do they have the same capacity and/or run time for certain identical tasks?  I know strongiPhone 5/strong's battery has a charge capacity of 1440mAh. Has this been improved in the new strongiPhone 5s/strong and/or strongiPhone 5c/strong?  <answer101541> During the keynote, Phil Schiller stated that the battery on the iPhone 5C was slightly larger than the battery on the current iPhone 5, and the Apple iPhone compare page states the same battery life for the 5C and the 5S, so I suspect they may have the same battery.  <answer101633> There are slight improvements to the battery capacities of the 5S and 5C over the 5.  ul liiPhone 5 - 1440mAh &lt;- 5.45Whr at 3.8V/li liiPhone 5c - 1508mAh &lt;- 5.73Whr at 3.8V/li liiPhone 5s - 1558mAh &lt;- 5.92Whr at 3.8V/li /ul  Source  hr  In terms of battery life comparison for 5 vs. 5c vs. 5s, they ran some benchmarks in their review.  In some tasks the 5c/5s are better than the 5, in others the 5 is better.  With the exception of their Wifi browsing test, the new phones are comparable to the 5, with there being less than an hour difference in battery life.  In the Wifi browsing test though, the new phones ran out of juice .57 hours sooner (5c) and 1.3 hours sooner (5s).  <comment119636> 5S and 5C with the same battery? What about 5C/S comparing to 5? Would like to know what slightly larger means... Can't find that info anywhere. <comment119676> Ah. You simply asked whether or not it had been improved. <comment119704> If the "charge capacity of 1440mAh" has improved. This is what I want to know. Concrete numbers (but maybe they haven't been released yet).
