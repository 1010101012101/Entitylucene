macOS Sierra doesn't recognise external Seagate drive <body> An external Seagate hard disk suddenly is not readable and when I click on "Initialize", I'm taken to Disk Utility which among other things also says "S.M.A.R.T status" isn't supported. The Seagate dashboard also tells me that my external drive is full, but it seems I can't to find a way to access my files on it.  <comment326497> SMART isn't supported over USB; though the rest maybe cause for concern.
