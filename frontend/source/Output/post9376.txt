Is there any way to auto-close Safari's download window upon download completion? <body> This is the only thing that bothers me with Safari, but it's a big deal. I've looked everywhere but can't seem to find any good suggestions. Is there any way to enable the Safari downloads window to automatically close when a download completes?  <answer9379> I use the Glims plugin for this, which has a host of other useful features, too.  <answer9384> I use SafariStand from Hetima.com (which also has many other useful features).  <answer9400> I use kbd⌥/kbdkbd⌘/kbdkbdL/kbd which doesn't have any other feature and doesn't do it automatically (but doesn't use any extra RAM) ;-)  <answer51704> killDownloadsWindow:      killDownloadsWindow is a lightweight utility that runs in the background and closes Safari's annoying download window when a download finishes. Simple, but effective
