Alfred takes longer to show results, database disk image is malformed <body> I don't know why, but about a week ago I started seeing a lot of errors like this in system.log:  precode9/15/12 5:55:21.769 AM Alfred[263]: DB Query: select item, count(item) as used from knowledge where ts &gt; ? and item in (?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?) group by item 9/15/12 5:55:21.769 AM Alfred[263]: DB Error: 11 "database disk image is malformed" /code/pre  It would occasionally take about a second for files to show up in the result list.  Deleting the Spotlight index didn't help, but then I noticed that the usage tab didn't display any statistics either:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AR0X5.png" alt=""  I think I solved it by just pressing the reset knowledge button. But I didn't find search results for this issue, so I'm answering this question myself.  <answer64284> So, pressing the reset knowledge button in the preferences seems to have fixed it.  If you get similar errors, you could also try removing code~/Library/Application Support/Alfred/knowledge.alfdb/code or other database files. If you're using a sandboxed version bought from the App Store, they are in code~/Library/Containers/com.alfredapp.Alfred/Data//code.
