How can I program in OpenGL on a Mac without Xcode? <body> For reasons I won't go in to, I can not and will not download Xcode. I have Mac 10.6.8. Getting OpenGl is a WILD GOOSE CHASE.  So, is there any way I can get OpenGl, without Xcode?  <answer81559> You first need to look at why you cannot download XCode, granted, I just use XCode for the gcc/clang compiler.   Have you got the original disks that came with your Machine? If so, then you can get XCode (by inserting 'Disk 2' I believe). Sadly, there are no packages out there that supports gcc without physically installing XCode, but, do check this binary release: http://hpc.sourceforge.net/   It does not seem possible to use OpenGL without the use of XCode - So, please try to find the install disks.   <comment94030> Are you looking for a way to install an older XCode on 10.6.8 or to develop in OpenGL without it? The first question is answered already (use search), the second is off topic <comment94069> If you sign up for a free developer account you can download just the command line tools, without Xcode. (At least you used to be able to... Now they only have Command Line tools for Lion.) <comment94071> I think I actually have the original install disk for the version of Xcode that you want. If you wait until I go back to uni, I could probably upload a copy. (That won't be for a month though. Comment on this post in a month to remind me...) <comment94113> Read the question. I was looking for an alternative for dowmloading Xcode. To develop in OpenGL without it. I was only asking one question. <comment94114> I don't have the disk. This is a used mac. I have no access to the disk. <comment101880> @JohnathanSherbert I've tried to make this about your desire to get OpenGl and avoid Xcode. Is that a good summary of your needs? That should be squarely on topic and re-openable, but I didn't want to re-open this until you confirm my edit as what you really want to do.
