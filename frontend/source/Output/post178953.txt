Quick look doesn't work in spotlight <body> When I use spotlight (on Yosemite 10.10.2), Quick Look doesn't display a preview in the right panel anymore. Only when I click on a folder in the left panel it displays the contents of the map in the right panel. But when I click on either a .pdf or a .pages file in the left panel, the right panel is empty, whereas a few weeks ago it still emdid/em display a preview in the right panel in those cases.  <answer179014> Do you have "Show Preview" or "Hide Preview" in the View menu when Finder is in the foreground? You can turn the Preview off and on with SHIFT + CMD + P.  However, the preview pane only works in column mode.  <comment212076> Do you have "Show Preview" or "Hide Preview" in the View menu when Finder is in the foreground?

Yet when I am in the Spotlight window, I cannot. The view menu displays "Show Preview" in grey letters in that case, suggesting that it cannot be turned off or on.  I am correct that the Spotlight function should also be able to show previews right? <comment212116> Preview only works in column mode. <comment212118> Has it always been like that? If I recall correctly, spotlight used to show previews as well. In any case, thanks for your help. <comment212127> Are you thinking of Spotlight searches launched from the menubar perhaps? Rather than Spotlight searches launched from the Finder. <comment212138> I am thinking of the Spotlight searches launched from CMD + SPACE (and thus not from ALT + CMD + SPACE). <comment218528> Had this happen to me...
