Why is there an infinite loop in the File System on a Mac? /Volumes/Macintosh HD/Volumes/Macintosh HD <body> While playing around with codefind/code in Terminal I came across this odd behavior: There seems to be an infinite loop in the Mac File System like so:   precode/Volumes/Macintosh HD/Volumes/Macintosh HD/ /code/pre  ...and so on.  Apparently it is possible to access codeVolumes/code and codeMacintosh HD/code over and over again.  How is this possible? Should this not confuse any process digging recursively through the File System?  <answer274888> /Volumes/&lt;startup is simply a symlink, and there's no rules against where you can link.  precode$ ls -la /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel     1B 22 Feb 15:40 /Volumes/Macintosh HD -&gt; / /code/pre  It's not an actual infinite loop, only a loop of links; once followed, you're put back up the path.  <comment327339> You said, "_While playing around with find..._", please add the exact `find` _command_, to your post, you were using to cause this loop. <comment327344> This has nothing to do with the specific command. I'm simply startled by the fact that `pwd` can produce the following output:  `/Volumes/Macintosh HD/Volumes/Macintosh HD/Volumes/Macintosh HD/Volumes/Macintosh HD/Volumes/Macintosh HD/Volumes/` <comment327345> `find` just pointed me to this because I tried to search only on my `Macintosh HD` and then realized that I got output from other volumes as well. <comment347618> Thanks! I guess what confused me was the output of `pwd`. It would make sense if that shortened the path.
