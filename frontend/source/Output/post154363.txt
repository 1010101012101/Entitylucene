Little Snitch in Safari-only guest account? <body> I have FileVault 2 enabled on Yosemite. I use Little Snitch and would generally like to limit information sent to Apple while I'm using the laptop, but I would also like to use Find my Mac.  In the past, before I enabled FileVault, I configured Little Snitch so that it allowed all of the proper communications (using Undercover) in the Guest account. Now that I am using FileVault, I have found that I have the special Safari-only Guest account. This means I can no longer use Undercover, so I am switching to Find my Mac. I was wondering, will Little Snitch be automatically disabled in the Safari-only guest account? Perhaps if you have knowledge more generally of whether startup services are enabled, then I would have my answer.  If this is the case, I should be able to lock everything down when I'm logged in to my account and no additional configuration should be needed to allow Find my Mac to call home from the Guest account. However, the reason I'm asking the question is that I tested it and Find my Mac doesn't seem to be getting out from the Guest account.  (I don't believe this is already answered, as the other questions don't seem to involve the Safari-only Guest account.
