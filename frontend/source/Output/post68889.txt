iChat Download For OS X 10.6.8 <body> I foolishly deleted iChat Application from my Mac with version of 10.6.8 for free disk space. Now am trying to download the .dmg file for the iChat app. Can anyone help me in this by sending any link to download the file?  <answer68890> The solution is reported on this discussion on the Apple Support Communities.   They report several ways to do that. The easiest way seems to be:     Insert your Tiger/Leopard/Snow Leopard DVD into your drive. Once the   DVD loads, open the "Optional Installs" folder and then the .mpkg of   the same name. This will launch an Installer. Click through until you   get the option of choosing what you'd like to install. (this is after   the Licence Agreement part)      Open the "Applications" by using the tick box and triangle for the   drop down menu in the panel of software to install, simply choose   iChat (only) and let the installer do the work.   <comment80024> Yup. i tried but when i am trying to download,am not getting installation process. unknowingly it is closing. can u tell me why it is...? and thanks for the reply. <comment80025> "iChat Update (PowerPC) canâ€™t be installed on this computer." this is am getting. <comment80027> version 10.6.8 Processor 2.4 Ghz Intel Core 2 Duo Memory 2 Gb 800 Mhz.
