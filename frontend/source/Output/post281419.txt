Using POSIX path to attach a file to email in AppleScript <body> I am attempting to send an email via the standard Apple Mail application using a POSIX file reference on macOS Sierra (10.12.3). Everything builds fine, but when it sends, the attachment is not being received.  Here's the code:  precodeset fileReference to (choose file with prompt "Select  file for attachment...")  tell application "Mail" make new attachment with properties {file name:fileReference} /code/pre  The recipient is set earlier in the code, and there are no issues with sending the email itself: just the attachment.  Any help or insight would be greatly appreciated.  <answer281428> ol liOpen Script Editor, create a new document, and add the AppleScript Code, shown below, to it./li liIn the codemake new to recipient .../code line of emcode/em, change the emvalues/em of code{name:"John Doe", address:"johndoe@domain.com"}/code to your name and email address for testing purposes./li liNow run the script.  ul liNote that after selecting the attachment, the script will compose the email, attach the file, strongand send it/strong./li liThen check your Inbox for the message, to see that the file was attached./li liIt worked for me!/li /ul/li /ol  AppleScript Code:  precodeset theAttachment to (choose file with prompt "Select file for attachment...") tell application "Mail"     set theMessage to make new outgoing message with properties {visible:true, subject:"File Attachment Test", content:"Was a file attached when you received this email?" &amp; linefeed &amp; linefeed}     tell theMessage         make new to recipient at end of to recipients with properties {name:"John Doe", address:"johndoe@domain.com"}     end tell     tell content of theMessage         make new attachment with properties {file name:theAttachment} at after last paragraph     end tell     send theMessage end tell /code/pre
