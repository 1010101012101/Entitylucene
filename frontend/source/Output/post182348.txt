Why is my iTunes making me download my songs again? <body> I recently updated my phone, and yesterday I realized that I wasn't able to play many of my songs. When I checked, it wants me to redownload all of my songs. I tried to do that, but it won't complete a full download on any songs! I have no idea what is wrong with it.  <comment217004> What system did you have before? iOS 6 or 7 eventually? Or a prior version of 8? Do you use iTunes Match? <comment217047> Did you choose auto sync in itunes so everyone you connect iPhone with computer, and open iTunes, the file transfer would be started all over again.
