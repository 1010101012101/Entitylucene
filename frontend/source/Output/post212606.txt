How to create a shortcut/alias for the "NTFS for Mac" preference? <body> I have a bootcamp Windows installed on my RMBP, and I used to use the "Startup Disk" preference to boot into windows. By click and drag the "StartupDisk.prefPane" from /System/Library/PreferencePanes/ to Desktop while holding Cmd+Option, an alias can be created on Desktop.  After installing "NTFS for Mac", the bootcamp Windows partition disappeared from the Startup Disk preference. And I have to use the "NTFS for Mac" preference to select.  I want to create a shortcut for "NTFS for Mac", but there is no "NTFS for Mac" in /System/Library/PreferencePanes/.  Where is the "NTFS for Mac.prefPane" located if there is one?  Or another way to create a shortcut for NTFS for Mac?  <answer212608> Mac OSX has two more locations where preference panes can reside:  ul licode/Library/PreferencePanes//code - This is where system wide 3rd party panes are installed. (The folder you looked in (code/System/Library/PreferencePanes//code) is reserved for core OS preference panes.)/li licode~/Library/PreferencePanes//code - This is where user-specific panes are installed./li /ul  Search these two locations and if you find the emNTFS for Mac/em preference pane there create a short cut as a link to the file.  <comment256718> /Library/PreferencePanes/NTFSforMacOSX.prefPane is what I'm looking for.
