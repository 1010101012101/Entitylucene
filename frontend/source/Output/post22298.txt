Full Screen 'Ads' on iPhone <body> I have been receiving messages on my iphone recently which takes up the whole screen, only with a dismiss button.  Apple Detecting Jailbreak on a NOT jailbroken iPhone  I have asked a question previously and realised it could be some sort of advertising by the telcos. Do anyone have the same experience too? Or there's known telco providers that send such stuff to users?  Another issue that I am quite in doubt is that the messages stated with the 'advertisments' are not advertising any products, just being irritating. Could it be some kind of 'ad-ware' instead?  <comment24705> Could be duplicate of http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/22120/apple-detecting-jailbreak-on-a-not-jailbroken-iphone. If you want to add details to a question, just edit the existing one, no need to make a new question. <comment24706> Hi again, please try to take a screenshot, as I am keen to see this.  Next time it happens, hold down home and press power, a picture will be in your camera roll. <comment24708> @Odinulf okay, i'll take note of that. But anyway, the duplicated you stated was the same question that I referred to above. <comment24710> @stuffe hello. hope not to get that again though. kinda irritating. but how it looks is just a simple message, with some spelling errors and missing punctuations which I noticed taking up 80% of the screen and a 20% screen for a dismiss button. Similar to the iphone in calling mode, the end call button is replaced with the dismiss button but in green, while the rest of the space is taken up by the message. It doesn't allow you to do anything other than dismissing it, before you can slide to unlock, like the usual. <comment24744> @footprint Yes, that's how I knew that it was a duplicate. If you are going to make a duplicate, you might as well be sneaky about it! :) <comment24751> @Odinulf well, I am kinda new to this stack exchange. I don't really know how these things work about. The reason for seperating the question was because I ever had someone telling me that if the question is a different question, like in such cases, it should be written separately, otherwise, it would render the previous question useless, because the answers would be a mismatch for the questions.
