How can I view the root directory along with all its subdirectories in Finder? <body> I want to view the all (sub-)directories on my Mac partition in Finder. Both hidden and unhidden directories.  How can I do this?  <answer57608> ol liNavigate to code//code (e.g. use kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbd&#x21E7;/kbd+kbdG/kbd.)/li liThen, in stronglist view/strong hold kbd&#x2325;/kbd while clicking the triangle. This will show all subdirectories of a certain folder./li /ol  By default, you'll don't see hidden files/directories. To show hidden files type the following commands in the codeTerminal.app/code:  precodedefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE killall Finder /code/pre  You can use the value codeFALSE/code in the codedefaults write/code command to unto this action.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VftUE.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer68359> Finder - Preferences. Check the box to show your Mac there, and you will be able to easily navigate wherever you want.  <comment66195> How do I get to /? When I open new Finder Window I can only see Favourites which are the following directories: Dropbox, All My Files, AirDrop, Applications, Desktop, Documents, Downloads, Movies, Music, Pictures <comment66196> @Anonymous The root directory is partition where you installed OS X. By default is has the name `Macintosh HD`. I've added a picture. <comment66198> I don't see Macintosh HD in Finder. <comment66199> @Anonymous You can manually navigate to the `/` directory this way: 1) Open a finder window 2) hit CMD+Shift+G 3) enter `/` <comment66200> OK, that good to know I'll use this keyboard shortcut. However, do you know why I can't seem to find Macintosh HD on Finder? Oh, and another thing, when I'm in a directory, let's say /Library, I want to search for a directory, but when I try to search it doesn't search from /Library but from "This Mac" instead. Is there a way to change its default mode? <comment66201> @Anonymous **[Search current folder in Finder](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/40016/13414)** <comment66202> @Anonymous I'm not sure why you don't see the hard drive in Finder. Please check the *finder preferences* under *general* and *sidebar*. That should do it. <comment66203> That was great, now I have my full hard-drive and the search is working properly. However, I still have two more questions: 1) how can I go back from the current directory to its parent directory if I'm using keyboard shortcut Command Shift G? 2)on / I only see Applications, Library, System, User Information and Users - why don't I see the real /? <comment66204> I found how to go to the parent directory - enabling path bar, right click on the directory wanted enables that. <comment66207> @Anonymous You don't see the "real" `/` because Finder only provides a graphical interface (GUI). Most users would get confused if your hard drive were simply named `/`. The `Terminal.app` on the other hand shows `/` when you're in the root directory. <comment66209> neat I've managed to see the hidden files too now :) Thanks a lot! <comment66212> Do you know how I can use spotlight, for instance to write / and then it will open finder within / ? Instead of opening new Finder Window, then Command + Shift + G ) <comment79371> Welcome to AskDifferent.
