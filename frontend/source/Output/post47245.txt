Apache virtualhost - Mac OSX 10.7.3 <body> After upgrading to Lion, all my virtualhosts stopped working. They redirect to "It works" main apache page on my device for some weird reason.  Example:  /etc/hosts: code127.0.0.1  myhost.com/code  precode&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;     DocumentRoot "/Library/WebServer/Documents/testproj/"     ServerName myhost.com      &lt;Directory "/Library/WebServer/Documents/testproj/"&gt;         Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews         AllowOverride All         Order allow,deny         Allow from all     &lt;/Directory&gt;      ErrorLog "/private/var/log/apache2/testproj-error_log"     CustomLog "/private/var/log/apache2/testproj-access_log" common &lt;/VirtualHost&gt; /code/pre  Did anyone else face the same issue? How can I fix this?  <answer47249> There could be multiple causes to this issue.  First, have you tried restarting Apache?br You can do so by typing codesudo apachectl graceful/code in the Terminal.  If that doesn't work out, try to create a folder in the predestined folder (Sites), and see if it works. Alsoo, make sure you've enabled the proper settings:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/J8W5R.png" alt="enter image description here"  And just for the record, my codehttpd-vhosts.conf/code file (on a Windows though) looks like this:  precodeNameVirtualHost *:80  &lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;     ServerName dev.test.be     ErrorLog "logs/test.log"     CustomLog "logs/test.log" common     DocumentRoot "C:\Users\me\workspace\test\drupal" &lt;/VirtualHost&gt; /code/pre  <answer59592> Where is that snippet of VirtualHost config? Are you sure it's being read in?  I notice that by default, the code/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf/code file is not read in by the main codehttpd.conf/code so you'd have to uncomment the line to read it in.  You can check what Apache thinks of the current vhost config with  precodesudo httpd -S /code/pre  and verify that your myhost.com is there.  Please update your question with the results of this if it's not the problem so we can start narrowing it down.  <comment54182> Tried all... nothing happened. The virtualhost configs are unchanged since the upgrade and they used to be working quite fine
