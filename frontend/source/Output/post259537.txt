Unable to create a NetBoot image on Sierra <body> I've been trying for a couple of ways in every way imaginable to create a Netboot image for sierra.br Up until now I've tried doing the following:br - Mounting the disk from a vm and using that as sourcebr - Using the Install Sierra.app as sourcebr - Using a tool like autoNBIbr - Doing the whole workflow through the automator    But when using the disk image utility it always gives error 2 after the "Creating cache" step.br Any clues?  Creating a netrestore image is no problem by the way..  I tried running the commandline tool imagetool instead. It gave me a very similar error. Here is the complete output:    precodeimagetool --netboot --index 2000 --source /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD\ 2 --destination '/Users/Styleshoots/Desktop/netboot\ images/' --name 'sierra netboot'  2016-11-01 14:20:46.182 imagetool[788:13710] Imaging failed.

As a semi-solution (workaround?), you could follow the steps on this web page that shows how to create a NetBoot image (.nbi) using the Install Sierra.app as source. I was able to create a "plain" NetBoot image with these steps. I assume you could also customize stuff using additional Installer packages and post-install scripts.  I'm still looking for a (free-style, good-old) way to create a NetBoot image from a custom bootable macOS Sierra partition though.  <comment324704> Have you followed [Apple's Guidelines](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202061) and [here](https://help.apple.com/advancedserveradmin/mac/4.0/#/apdAD721031-E0DC-4B86-8AA5-51A147F1BF45)? <comment324705> Indeed I have, point for point <comment327051> Make sure you're updated to 10.12.1, I ran into a lot of issues creating images with 10.12.0 which are better in the latest update. <comment356535> Have you gotten anything to work? <comment356811> I did, I don't have the solution with me any more, but I remember that inside of the imagetool, there are a couple of shellscripts and there was a variable somewhere that defined the maximum cache size. I figure it would run out of space. I hope this helps
