Does HTML5 offline webapp still work in Safari / iPad / iPhone? <body> When I search Google about HTML5 offline features I can only find some answers dated 2010 / 2011. Nothing recent appears.  Besides the web app behaves erratic on iOS: sometimes it will work, even when navigating several times to cached pages, and then, all of a sudden, it "decides" it needs Internet connection and then, impossible to reload the home page from either the home screen icon, of from an URL in Safari. "Not connected!".  I'm using a manifest file called "example.appcache" and the related mime type is duly declared on my IIS 7 server.  Does someone have recent answers?   <answer271205> It is still supported. You better check your code again  <comment340907> Welcome to Ask Different.
