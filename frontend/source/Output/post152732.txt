How do I get the picture for a contact to appear in Calendar? <body> When one of my contacts accepts an invitation in Calendar, I don't see their contact picture (even though the relevant e-mail address only appears once in Contacts, associated with a picture and even though I can examine the invitation and confirm that it is linked to the appropriate contact).  How do I get the picture for a contact to appear in Calendar?  <comment179823> Only if the contact has made a pic in their profile! is that the case ? <comment179825> @Buscarì›ƒ: In my Contact for them, or somewhere else? <comment179829> sorry, I misread your question, you want it to show in Calender, I do not know how to do that.
