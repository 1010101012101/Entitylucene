Trying to stop importing a Photo Library from a flash drive <body> I want to stop importing my photos from my flash drive to my Photos library. However, because the flash drive holds over 80 gigabytes of data, the import has been extremely slow. I want to stop the import process. How would I do that strongwithout/strong damaging my flash drive data or my Photos Library data? Will force quitting the Photos app damage the flash drive or my Library?
