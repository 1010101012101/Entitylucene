Can not access certain websites from my MacBook or iPhone [WiFi] <body> I can't access certain websites from either my MacBook nor from my iPhone when connected to my WiFi network, but the same websites can be reached from a Windows computer connected on the same network. Three days ago everything worked, but then it stopped working.  This is what happens when I try to ping it:  precodePING ilpost.it (151.1.175.113): 56 data bytes Request timeout for icmp_seq 0 Request timeout for icmp_seq 1 Request timeout for icmp_seq 2 ... /code/pre  And when I try to traceroute it:  precodehost-001:~ j$ traceroute www.ilpost.it traceroute to ilpost.it (151.1.175.113), 64 hops max, 52 byte packets  1  vodafonedslrouter (192.168.1.1)  2.965 ms  0.743 ms  0.745 ms  2  * 2.96.54.77.rev.vodafone.pt (77.54.96.2)  12.076 ms  10.871 ms  3  77.41.30.213.rev.vodafone.pt (213.30.41.77)  14.145 ms  10.693 ms  11.960 ms  4  85.205.11.49 (85.205.11.49)  9.658 ms  8.946 ms  9.085 ms  5  85.205.13.105 (85.205.13.105)  57.497 ms  57.621 ms  48.080 ms  6  188.111.129.17 (188.111.129.17)  49.483 ms  51.338 ms  48.852 ms  7  85.205.25.174 (85.205.25.174)  47.891 ms  49.219 ms  47.821 ms  8  * * *  9  * * * 10  * * * 11  * * * /code/pre  I've flushed my DNS cache but nothing changed.  This is quite dramatic as it seems to depend on 85.205.25.174 hop and I don't know how to avoid it.  <answer65608> Ping (ICMP) packets can be blocked though you are still able to access the website.  Telnet to port 80 is actually a better test to verify whether you are able to connect or not.  Over here connecting to http://ilpost.it results in no problem:  precode$ telnet ilpost.it 80                                                                   (28-09-12 13:58) Trying 151.1.175.113... Connected to ilpost.it. /code/pre  Although ilpost.it redirects to http://www.ilpost.it/  <comment77136> From where do you try to access theses domains? <comment77137> From my homeplace in Portugal. Thanks <comment77170> Maybe check to see that the Mac has the same DNS servers as the Windows box. <comment77808> I'd check the DNS too, but what websites in particular can't you reach? Is your hosts file to blame?
