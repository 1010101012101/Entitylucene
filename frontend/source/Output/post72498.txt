kernel_task consumes 500% CPU on AC power, sometimes <body> Typically, my kernel_task process uses 1-4% CPU and 100-700MB of memory. However, sometimes when I have the power adapter plugged in, the CPU usage jumps to around 500% (8 cores) and stays there until I unplug the power adapter. I can plug it back in and everything is fine for a few seconds or a few days, then it eventually happens again. How can I stop this from happening?  <answer72505> In my experience this has always been due to a hardware fault. However before doing anything else reset the SMC as detailed here: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3964 as its power related.   This appears to happen when the Mac is struggling to communicate with hardware. Which Mac is it? How old is the battery? Is your battery life still good? Has the Mac had any damage - dropped? Liquid? Have you tried a different power adapter?   <answer72604> http://www.rdoxenham.com/?p=259 covers disabling the kernel extension responsible for triggering this misbehavior. However, doing so also disables some other thermal management functionality.  <answer98202> my kernel_task issue (cpu at - 500% for ever) was blutooth related:  http://droolfactory.blogspot.com.es/2012/08/mac-os-x-lion-kerneltask-with-high-cpu.html  <answer98211> Please have a look at this typical problem: kernel_task at 300% and the suggested method of analysis: diagnosis of a CPU hog.  The codeActivity Manager/code isn't acurate enough to help you see that there are other processes indirectly loading the Kernel. codetop/code will unveil these hogs.  To display processes sorted starting with the biggest CPU consummer:  precodetop -o cpu /code/pre  ...sorted starting with the biggest virtual memory consummer:  precodetop -o vsize /code/pre  ...sorted starting with the process making the more context switches (being started and stopped with a huge frequency, sometimes the result of 2 processes talking together, not letting the other processes the freedom to get the cpu):  precodetop -o csw /code/pre  <answer131011> I got this issue once on my 15-inch Mid 2012 MBP running 10.8.4 because the audio input had switched to the internal microphone and it was picking up the constant noise of my fan.  Switched the audio input to Line In and cpu usage dropped from 524% to 3%  <comment84304> MBP 2011, as old as the laptop, yes, no, no, yes. <comment84306> This is interesting, but you have to ask what is causing the problem in the first place. Something isn't right. As I said, everytime I've seen this, there has been a hardware fault. <comment115316> For me this analysis doesn't explain correctly the origin of the problem. Moreover, I'm deeply convinced through other cases that the overheating and the `kernel_task` eating all the CPU are just correlated consequences of the same causing problem. Stupid loops within a kernel can only lead to overheating. <comment115376> You should provide at least a short summary of the article you are referencing. The goal is to make Ask Different a self-sufficient resource. <comment125763> How do you use `top` to unveil these hogs? <comment216026> Disabling ambient noise cancelling seems to make it go away for me, in addition to removing power adapter (for now), will see if it continues to stay fixed. <comment314437> What this during FaceTime or Skype or did this happen all th etime? <comment314441> Does/did this only happen when an external monitor is being used? I find I get overheating when I extend out to a second monitor.
