iPhone 4S keeps old numbers in Messages <body> The numbers that are no longer in my contacts still keep popping up when I try to compose a new message.   Why is this happening? Is there a way to purge the contact list so no emalready-deleted-contact/em remains?  <answer94231> Power the phone off and then on again. That should clear out the bug.  <answer127526> Assuming you have iOS 7 (now) I can provide you the steps on how to remove strongRecent/strong contacts in the strongMessages.app/strong.  ol liOpen Messages.app/li liStart composing new message/li liOnce the list starts showing up, press the strongblue 'i' icon/strong next to the number./li liPress the redline strongDelete from recent/strong/li liYou're done, repeat these steps for the contacts you don't want to show up anymore./li /ol  EDIT: Community bumped this thread up making me answer it because I never check the dates. I hope I can still help anyone  out with this answer.  <comment108781> Just a guess, but do you perhaps have texts from these people still saved in Messages? Perhaps iOS is polling both your contacts and your message history for suggestions. <comment110500> This does not provide an answer to the question.
