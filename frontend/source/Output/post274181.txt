How do I remove the iCloud symbol when trying to download an app? <body> I've searched and found the Find My iPhone app in the App Store. However, I can't download it as there is an iCloud Symbol and I can't get rid of it. How do I get the desired app on my iPhone 6?  <answer274182> Tap the cloud to download. The iCloud symbol just means you can download the app from your purchase history.
