Producing a standard tilde while using OS X (U.S. International - PC) keyboard layout <body> The tilde, kbd~/kbd, generated by the emU.S. International - PC/em layout and the tilde, kbd~/kbd, produced by the emU.S./em layout are allegedly different characters.  How can I produce the emU.S./em tilde while using the International keyboard?  <answer86568> To produce the standard tilde (U+007E) with US International PC you just type tilde and then space.  It will be exactly the same as what you get by typing tilde with the US layout.  <answer86778> Take a look at KeyRemap4Macbook if you want to permanently remap, it's got a tonne of options.  Another way to do this, if you're using Lion or above is adding to the codePressAndHold/code IOS-esque feature.  Ukelele can allegedly do this, or take a look over here: Mountain Lion - Umlauts with english keyboard layout  <comment100359> Did you actually try PressAndHold?  As far as I can see it does NOT help you produce a tilde with the US International PC layout.  Also it seems kind of crazy to remap the keyboard for this, when you can just type a space <comment100423> I was referring to adding to `PressAndHold` as per the linked answers, tilde isn't in the defaults. I have clarified the wording above. You're right it does seem like overkill to remap the Keyboard or parts of if it but in my experience and workflow it's a one-time maintenance free effective solution. I'm answering with the ways I know how to do this and it's up to the reader how they want to solve it using the options available. <comment100427> Both symbols in your question are U+007E TILDE; they’re identical. <comment100512> @MathiasBynens While the question currently displays the same tilde character, I think it is clear what the poster intends:  When you don't type a space after it, the US International PC tilde key generates ˜, U+02DC.
