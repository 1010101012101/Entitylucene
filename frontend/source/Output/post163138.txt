Is there an option to delete old photos off my iPod? <body> I have no option to delete old photos off my iPod. They are old photos, by that I mean they were on my iPod then I got them off, and about a year later (I had synced it a couple of times in between) I synced my iPod to my laptop and they all came back with no option to delete them off.  <answer163208> You can choose what should synchronise, from iTunes  [iDevice]  Photos  You can switch off sync entirely, or choose from Albums, Events, Faces; whether to include videos &amp; whether to automatically add recent Events.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TlNk2.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment190975> Did they come back to your laptop or iPod? If it's both, then you can turn off Photo Syncrizonation in iTunes,
