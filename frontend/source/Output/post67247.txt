Why can’t I share my Internet connection with another Mac? <body> I tried to share my Internet connection with another Mac but it failed. I could before I upgraded to Mountain Lion.  I have a 3G USB modem that I use for Internet. I went to emSystem Preferences/em → emSharing/em → emInternet Sharing/em → Select my 3G device from emShare your connection from/em → Tick emWI-FI/em → Setup emWI-FI Options.../em and then enable Internet sharing.  However, the other Mac can see my network but cannot join.  How do I fix this?
