Macbook Pro stuck booting after Sierra 10.12.1 update <body> I have an MBP mid-2010, which had Sierra 10.12 running. I updated to 10.12.1 and now the MBP gets stuck booting at the screen with the Apple logo with the progress bar at 100%.   I have already tried recovery mode with first aid disk repair, but the MBP gets stuck booting afterwards as well.   What can I do to fix this?  <answer282881> The problem was a kernel extension that prevented the boot. In my case it was hpioenabler. After removing it I was able to boot.   <comment356509> Same here. Did you solve it finally? <comment356518> Yes, see my answer.
