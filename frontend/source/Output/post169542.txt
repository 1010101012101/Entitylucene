Photo viewer for Mac that can rotate (and save) pics while browsing folders <body> I am coming from Win and I am so disappointed by Mac's usability so far. My current problem is with maintaining photos. I usually take lot of pictures with my DSLR and I want a very simple solution to:  ul librowse through pictures where they are - without the need to copy them to some library like in iPhoto/li liability to easily rotate one or more of them at a time - unlike in preview where you can rotate only one picture in only one direction/li lithey should stay rotated(!!!) after I close the program - unlike x mac apps that I tried that do not save the rotation, which is totally useless/li lilarge/full screen preview, with easy way to jump to prev/next photo without any headache inducing animation/li liI want to know the number of pictures in a folder without going to a special menu like in Finder/li liI don't want to spend more than $1-$2 on this simple app. /li /ul  I am sorry if this sounds like a rant but I have tried so many options so far including spending money on useless app in the app store.   <answer169556> So if you only want to spend $2 for such an app, you definitely will be disappointed in every direction you will take a look at.  Regarding my most famous and favourite graphics manipulation and imaging software "Graphicconverter", which can do everything you want and described, you would pay 35â‚¬. But if you want to, you can try it out.   http://www.lemkesoft.de/en/products/  <comment199324> Have you tried Image Capture? <comment199360> nope, let me google it
