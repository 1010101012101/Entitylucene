How to recover lost space on a Fusion drive <body> I have attempted to add an ordinary partition with Disk Utility on my fairly recent iMac Mac16,2 under Sierra 10.12.10 and the process did not complete. I have now a shrunk disk capacity that I would like to restore to full size and of course hopefully partition again.  The result of the commands codediskutil list/code is below :  precode/dev/disk0 (internal):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                         24.0 GB    disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     314.6 MB   disk0s1    2:          Apple_CoreStorage Macintosh HD            23.6 GB    disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Boot OS X               134.2 MB   disk0s3  /dev/disk1 (internal, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk1    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk1s1    2:          Apple_CoreStorage Macintosh HD            999.3 GB   disk1s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk1s3  /dev/disk2 (internal, virtual):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD           +511.3 GB   disk2                                  Logical Volume on disk0s2, disk1s2                                  2AB30341-3348-4A92-80FD-1271A95C1F00                                  Unencrypted Fusion Drive /code/pre  The results of the command codediskutil cs list/code is below :  precodeImac-Yves:~ yves$ diskutil cs  list CoreStorage logical volume groups (1 found) | +-- Logical Volume Group 965EB469-4062-42AF-95E7-14DA92C4DB7C     =========================================================     Name:         Macintosh HD     Status:       Online     Size:         1022898851840 B (1.0 TB)     Free Space:   510672154624 B (510.7 GB)     |     +-&lt; Physical Volume E99B6285-8C00-4392-9BB4-AA5ADB10EAAA     |   ----------------------------------------------------     |   Index:    0     |   Disk:     disk0s2     |   Status:   Online     |   Size:     23553724416 B (23.6 GB)     |     +-&lt; Physical Volume D429EA10-114F-40D0-9C1A-28D3525D99B3     |   ----------------------------------------------------     |   Index:    1     |   Disk:     disk1s2     |   Status:   Online     |   Size:     999345127424 B (999.3 GB)     |     +-&gt; Logical Volume Family 99C26113-76DE-4128-9925-04FA9D496C9F         ----------------------------------------------------------         Encryption Type:         None         |         +-&gt; Logical Volume 2AB30341-3348-4A92-80FD-1271A95C1F00             ---------------------------------------------------             Disk:                  disk2             Status:                Online             Size (Total):          511321964544 B (511.3 GB)             Revertible:            No             LV Name:               Macintosh HD             Volume Name:           Macintosh HD             Content Hint:          Apple_HFS             LVG Type:              Fusion, Sparse /code/pre  I have attempted various approches found in the various related posts, such as booting from both internet and from an external disk and using:  precodediskutil verifyDisk disk0 /code/pre  The results finish by:     The volume 965EB469-4062-42AF-95E7-14DA92C4DB7C appears to be OK   Storage system check exit code is 0 Incorrect size for volume   "Macintosh HD"   Then I tried the following commands:  precodediskutil repairDisk disk0 diskutil coreStorage resizeStack 2AB30341-3348-4A92-80FD-1271A95C1F00  0b /code/pre  However none of the two commands were successful I got an error code-69674/code reported, and:     the provided core storage logical volume has an incorrect size you should run whole disk repair   I have no clear idea on what to do next. I have backups, but I would like to go the shortest route and possibly learn something. I had a look at the codegpt/code commands posted in a parallel topic, but this seems a bit complicated.   I have switched from a PowerMac G5 under OSX 10.4 and I am not comfortable with the recent changes.  <comment372094> same situation: cs resizeVolume 2AB30341-3348-4A92-80FD-1271A95C1F00 1021994004480b Started CoreStorage operation Error: -69674: The provided Core Storage logical volume has an incorrect size; you should run whole-disk repair Imac-Yves:~ yves$ diskutil cs resizeVolume 2AB30341-3348-4A92-80FD-1271A95C1F00 1021980m The Core Storage Logical Volume UUID is 2AB30341-3348-4A92-80FD-1271A95C1F00 Started CoreStorage operation Error: -69674: The provided Core Storage logical volume has an incorrect size; you should run whole-disk repair.

Can I do this from disk utility ? <comment372108> The post you referred had two sections, one on the use of gpt, that I tried to follow, The second advice was to delete the Logical Volume and re-add a new one. My question is how ? Using disk utility ? <comment372111> None of the provided links (answers) requires `gpt`. The first answer is a cursory answer and the second is a full how-to answer. <comment372277> Erasing the volume "Macintosh HD" with disk utility enabled the recovery of the original size.
