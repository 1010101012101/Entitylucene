Possible to monitor URLs an application is connecting to? <body> I'm relatively new to the wondrous world of Apple and Mac OS X so please bear with me..  I have an application which I would like to see which URLs it is "connecting" or "communicating" with.  Is that at all possible and if so, I would be very glad to be pointed in the right direction.

Web debugging proxy application that listens to all http &amp; https traffic from your machine to the internet (including all running apps on your computer).  <comment140038> What did you use on Windows? Or are you totally new to such thing to monitor URL's? Is WireShark an option?
