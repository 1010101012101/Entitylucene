Easiest way to get path of currently-opened file in Adobe Acrobat? <body> When viewing a file in Adobe Acrobat Pro XI on OSX Yosemite, I sometimes want to send the file to another application. To create an action in KeyboardMaestro, I need to get the path of the currently-open file from Acrobat. How can I get the path?   A way to send the value to the clipboard would be enough; getting a value I can manipulate in AppleScript would be even better.  <answer236925> In Acrobat, like in many applications, you can strongdrag-and-drop the document icon from the window's title bar to other applications/strong, which hands over the file's path (hold down the mouse button slightly longer before dragging). For example, if you drop the icon on the Desktop, the Finder creates an alias icon. If you drop it in a TextEdit document, the PDF is embedded in the text document, etc.    I'm not familiar with KeyboardMaestro, but I think it should be able to utilize this standard OS X feature somehow.  Otherwise you can still use OS X's Automator application and create a small application to drop the document icon onto (e.g. in the Dock) and send the file path to the clipboard. It's quite easy. The steps are:   ol liOpen the Automator application./li liChoose to create a codenew Application/code./li liIn the right-hand Actions pane, expand the codeLibrary/code and click codeUtilities/code./li liIn the list of Actions, drag the action codeCopy to Clipboard/code into the left-hand assembly pane./li liPress CMD-S to save the new application, e.g., in the Applications folder./li liDrag the application icon into the Dock. /li /ol  Done.  <answer236966> So here's an AppleScript that I pasted together with the help of some other answers and the AppleScript reference. This puts the URL of the frontmost Acrobat document to the clipboard, e.g: codefile://localhost/Users/Your%20Username/Documents/Some%20Folder/Filename.pdf/code  precode tell application "System Events"         tell process "Acrobat"             set thefile to value of attribute "AXDocument" of window 1         end tell     end tell  set the clipboard to thefile /code/pre  <answer237020> strong(The manual way)/strong Cmd-click (or right-click) the Acrobat window title and choose the parent folder. Ã…pen Terminal and drag the PDF-file into the terminal window. Copy the file path from the Terminal window.  <comment290075> Thanks, but this is **not at all** what I'm seeking. I'm trying to get the path programmatically. The fact that I'm using KeyboardMaestro should have made that clear, but I also tagged the question with "applescript" and "script" ...
