Copy text from quick look in El Capitan or Sierra? <body> I used to be able to just quicklook files and copy the text directly from there, removing the need to launch applications to open it which is just awesome, however, it doesn't seem to work since El Capitan. I have tried running the terminal command (codedefaults write com.apple.finder QLEnableTextSelection -bool TRUE/code) that enables it but it didn't work.  What options exist to customize quick look or replace the default plug in with one that allows text selection?  <answer211625> Just to tie together the comments &amp; partial answers…  Current state of play [as of OS X 10.11.2] would actually appear to be "this can no longer be done".  Regarding the following on codeQLEnableTextSelection/code… that one alternative will fix it whilst the other doesn't appears to be some kind of hopeful, yet unfounded, meme going round the interweb - people posting it on as received wisdom, without actually testing it.  Here is the method anyway… though it doesn't work for El Capitan...  Test whether the pref already exists, &amp; if it does what its current value is, usingbr codedefaults read com.apple.finder QLEnableTextSelection/code  Then try one of these to set your new prefbr codedefaults write com.apple.finder QLEnableTextSelection -bool TRUE/code orbr codedefaults write com.apple.finder QLEnableTextSelection -bool YES/code    Test again to check the value was at least written, should return code1/code if present &amp; enabled.  Restart the Finder if your result did change from code0/code to code1/code.  Empirically, codeYES/code &amp; codeTRUE/code give the same result, as do codeNO/code &amp; codeFALSE/code    <answer212923> ol li   It's not that the defaults write command fails. I verified the file,   and it wrote the variable to it. The problem is somewhere in the   design. Maybe they have moved it? I have been looking in the   containers and other files but no luck yet. I hope they didn't   completely kill it. Maybe there is a way to copy the old Yosemite   version of QL back? If I figure it out, I will update here.   https://origin-discussions-us.apple.com/thread/7250702 /li liTRUE - YES or 1 have the same effect, so, there is no problem on this side./li liThe option is no longer available on Onyx or TinkerTools too :/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/W16Bm.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongConclusion :/strong  Actually there is no solution to get back the text edit feature on Quick Look.  Following this Apple Thread is the last way to keep hope  <comment255458> The result of the `read` command for me is 1, but I still can't select text... <comment255459> As I kind of suspected; you can add the default, but it's not being acted on. I'm not on el cap yet [was for one afternoon but rolled back] so I couldn't test. I just thought it better to drag the disparate info into a single answer, though. <comment256849> In the past, I've seen a preference type change from an int "1" (or, maybe a string "YES") to bool "TRUE" when the OS version was updated.  Hard to imagine that the reverse would happen, but not completely unthinkable.  No ElCap installation for me to check yet. <comment257129> This sucks. It was one of the best features of Mac OS X. Why would they remove it? <comment257140> I think the problem is somewhere in the design (click and move the window is in conflict with the text selection)... Perhaps the feature will be back in the next EC update ^^ <comment257182> I understand that design problem, but it's not on on default, most users won't bother with Terminal commands like that so it shouldn't be a problem. I hope it comes back too, if it doesn't I hope someone makes a plugin.
