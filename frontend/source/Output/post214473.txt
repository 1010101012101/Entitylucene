Create bootable USB disk with Bootcamp 6 <body> I have OS X El Capitan with Bootcamp 6 in an Early 2015 Retina Macbook Pro. I want to create a bootable USB disk with Windows 10 to install it and then completely remove OS X. I have read different answers:  ul liCan i remove OS X completely and install Windows?/li liCreating A Bootable USB Of Windows 8.1 On OS X?/li liBootable Windows 7 USB won't boot/li liHow to Create a Windows 10 Installer USB Drive from Mac OS X/li /ul  But I can't get my USB to show when booting and pressing the "Option" key, only my external disk with the Time Machine backup and the internal SSD is showed. I tried using Bootcamp to create a USB disk as shown here:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VWhfJ.png" alt="enter image description here"  But with Bootcamp 6 it just asks me for an ISO and then proceeds to repartition my disk, I can't create a bootable Windows disk. I also tried using RUFUS to create a bootable Windows USB disk but it is not detected neither. Any solution or alternative?  <answer214618> Solved it! I created the bootable USB with Rufus, just select the Windows ISO and format the disk as FAT32. The partition scheme must be codeMBR Partition Scheme for UEFI/code if you select compatibility for both codeBIOS/code and codeUEFI-CSM/code it won't be detected on startup.
