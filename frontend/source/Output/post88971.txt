What kind of adaptor do I need to connect RJ45 / ethernet cable to my Macbook Pro Retina display? <body> There is no RJ45 / ethernet port on my macbook.  Do I need a thunderbolt or USB or HDMI adaptor?  Or should I just buy a mini wireless router?  <answer88973> Your best bet is Apple's Thunderbolt to Gigabit Ethernet adapter.  There are also assorted USB ethernet adapters available from various sources (including Apple), including a few Gigabit ones that use USB 3.0, but the Thunderbolt one will likely have the best performance, so unless you're using both Thunderbolt ports already, that's the better choice.  <comment104323> Thanks - what is the benefit of this over a small wireless router?  I am often hot-desking you see.. So need something portable.  Is the thunderbolt a lot faster, and / or quantifiably more reliable? <comment104328> Yes more reliable and yes, way faster. <comment122170> Don't forget the mini router would almost certainly require another power supply to cart around.
