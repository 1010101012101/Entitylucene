How do I delete a file that doesn't appear in finder <body> I messed up and made the file name ... full name ....fbx. I don't really know why around the terminal. And after seeing How to move files to trash from command line? saying that rm "not permanently deleting files." How would I move it to trash or permanently delete it.  <answer245833> If a filename starts with a dot (.), it is hidden and will not show by default in Finder. You can show hidden files in Finder by running the following command in Terminal:  precodedefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES; killall Finder /code/pre  Then go back to the containing folder and delete the file normally.  If you don't want to keep the change regarding displaying hidden files in Finder, run  precodedefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles NO; killall Finder /code/pre  afterwards.
