Deleting password from Keychain in terminal <body> I'm having trouble deleting the github credentials from Keychain Access. Keychain Access just freezes everytime I try. Is there a command to force deletion of an item in the Keychain from the terminal?  <answer235418> You may first try to find the credentials (or better the blob):  precodesecurity find-internet-password -l "github.com"  /Users/user_name/Library/Keychains/login.keychain /code/pre  Then delete them with:  precodesecurity delete-internet-password -l "github.com"  /Users/user_name/Library/Keychains/login.keychain /code/pre  If you have several github.com items you have to repeat this. Create a backup of your login.keychain (or better the whole Keychain folder) before proceeding.  <comment289609> Perhaps you question should be how to fix Keychain? <comment289643> Why would I ask a more general question for a specific case? <comment289644> Because you're not solving the problem just working around it. Others could have a similar problem so it would help them too. <comment289648> Problem was definitely solved. It was just a crude solution. Consider, what if someone would like to know how to delete a password from terminal for a _different_ reason? This questions will still help that general case.
