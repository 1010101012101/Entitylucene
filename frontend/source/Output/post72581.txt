Can any iOS app remotely wake a sleeping MacBook Air when the lid is closed? <body> I want to be able to access my Macbook Air (Late-2011, Mountain Lion), when the lid is closed (in sleep mode), remotely from my iPhone 4GS.    I have tried using LogMeIn Ignition App but it does not allow you to wake the laptop from sleep.  Is there any other way/solution people are using currently?  <answer72591> I have an Air that I leave in clamshell mode when it is at home.  I also have an AirPort router that connects it to the internet and have it set to have the Mac wake for Wi-Fi access in the Energy Saver system preference pane.  ul liOn iOS, I use the paid app Screens VNC app and configure it to use SSH./li liOn the Mac, I use the free Screens Connect app in conjunction with the also free Edovia remote location brokering service in case my router gets a new IP address. I don't really need that since I have a fixed IP address, but it simplifies setup and allows me to reach my Mac when it's not at home as well./li /ul  This setup works to wake my sleeping Air when I need to access my computer from any of my iOS devices through the internet.  <answer206501> Change the settings on your Mac computer so that the computer keeps running when you close the lid  <comment84283> You might be able to keep the LogMeIn app if you set up BackToMy Mac and use the [prompt app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/prompt/id421507115?mt=8) (or another ssh app) to wake your mac remotely from sleep first by the incoming ssh traffic. Your router will need to be an Airport or support the [Bonjour sleep proxy protocol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonjour_Sleep_Proxy) to translate the incoming ssh traffic into a WOL packet.
