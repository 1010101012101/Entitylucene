Repair network on Lion <body> I used to have Snow Leopard installed on a MacBook Pro and everything was fine. After upgrading to Lion network problems started to happen. Most of the time the network service can’t start (so I do not have wired nor wireless network access):  •There is no network icon on the top bar  •Moving the mouse pointer to the top bar shows the wait cursor (the rainbow cursor)  •If I try to enter to network settings then the network window freezes, not even showing the network adapters.  Usually I had to reset the computer 3 or 4 times until I get network again, but recently not even that works: the network always fail to start.  I’m pretty sure this is a software problem, as started to happen right after upgrading to Lion. Do you have an idea on how to solve this?  Thanks!
