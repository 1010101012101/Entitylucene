Exporting all file locations that could not be found on iTunes <body> I'm running Windows 7 64 bit and am using iTunes. I previously had an issue where when iTunes organized my media library (after transferring all my music over), the file names were auto-truncated to 40 characters. This effectively broke a large portion of my library.  To see all the songs that were broken I created a smart playlist of "dead" songs and exported that playlist information. Unfortunately, the dead locations did not get exported when I chose codeFile -&gt; Export Playlist/code, only the other metadata was exported. This is strange because when I actually select codeGet Info/code on the song, I can see the file path it is looking for.  Is there some way to get this information exported? I'm trying to write a script to auto-rename the files it finds to the correct (longer) file names.  Edit:  Here is an example:  Let's say I have a song that is broken in iTunes (the file path is incorrect). In iTunes this appears with the correct metadata. I can check the metadata by right clicking on the song in question and selecting codeGet Info/code.  My song structure looks like this:  precodeArtist: DJ Rashad Song: Last Winter Album: Double Cup Genre: Footwork Location: C:\My Music\iTunes\DJ Rashad\Double Cup\DJ Rashad - Last Winter.mp3 /code/pre  In this case the codeLocation/code attribute is incorrect, which is fine. But I still need this data when I export the information about the track. So I drag this track into its own playlist and export the information via codeFile -&gt; Export Playlist/code. I expect to see the structure above but instead what appears in the corresponding file is the following:  precodeArtist: DJ Rashad Song: Last Winter Album: Double Cup Genre: Footwork Location: /code/pre  Since iTunes does not find the location, it exports an empty location. Since I am writing a script to correct some broken paths, I do not want an empty location. I want the last known location of the file (the one that is displayed when viewing codeGet Info/code). How can I export the complete information under the codeLocation/code attribute?  <answer281104> suggest you go a different path.  first remove all the broken links in itunes Can I easily view all songs that iTunes can&#39;t locate in Finder?  then drag&amp;drop your complete lib back in itunes (there wont be duplicates, if you drag files that are already linked/imported.)  done  <comment352883> I'm sorry, I'm having trouble understanding what exactly you want to export.  Could you provide a couple examples?  Thanks <comment352892> @Cullub I've edited my original question to include an example :) <comment353223> Where did it truncate? Your example file has less than 40 chars in the name <comment353574> @Tetsujin I apologize, I created an example with less than 40 characters. Regardless, I just want to find out how to export where iTunes last saw the file (if the file itself was broken). <comment353576> I don't have an actual working method as yet but was having a look through the library.xml & wondered if the truncation was with or without the extension - for example `C:\My Music\iTunes\DJ Rashad\Double Cup\DJ Rashad - Last Wi` or `C:\My Music\iTunes\DJ Rashad\Double Cup\DJ Rashad - Las.mp3` or even the awful old Windows `NAME~1.mp3`style. <comment353625> @Tetsujin The file currently gets truncated and then the `.mp3` extension is added. So it might look like `DJ Rashad - Las.mp3` <comment353723> One problem with this method is that all my metadata (ratings most importantly) is lost.
