Dual Boot USB installation with OSX and Windows <body> I have a 16gb USB pendrive that I want to partition to be able to use it as a Window 7 and Mac OSX install drive (probably using a bootloader?!?)   I want to be able to use it on our Macs and PCs as a single all-singing all-dancing install drive.  Can anyone point me in the right direction to a guide to do this? is it even possible? I have both Windows and Mac machines at my disposal.  <answer167358> I just bought three 8 GB thumb drives to use as OS X, Linux, and Windows 7 installers.  I suppose you could split the thumb drive into two 8 GB partitions and create two installers.  Whether or not both are visible on Macs and PCs is unknown.  I suppose it will depend on the hardware.  To create the OS X installer, you need only run the following from Terminal.app.  Note the partition name, I used "Untitled" for the script below.     /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\   Yosemite.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia  --volume   /Volumes/Untitled --applicationpath /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\   Yosemite.app --nointeraction   To create the Windows installer, you take the Windows installation ISO file on a Mac, go here and scroll down to "Creating a Windows flash drive installer on an OS X computer".  <comment196309> Thanks for your answer. I already have the images required for the installers for both OSX and Windows, the difficulty I have is getting them both on one pendrive and being bootable on both a mac and a PC. I think I need to use some sort of bootloader but I'm not sure what to use.
