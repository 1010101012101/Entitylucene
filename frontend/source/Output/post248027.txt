Can I use Google Emoji on mac? <body> I want to use Google/Android emoji (noto font) instead of the standard apple emoji set. Can I do that on mac?   codesudo cp Downloads/NotoColorEmoji-unhinted/NotoColorEmoji.ttf /library/fonts/Apple\ Color\ Emoji.ttf/code doesn't change anything and SIP prevents changes to code/System/Library/Fonts/Apple Color Emoji.ttf/code  I'm running 10.11.6 on a 5k iMac if it makes a difference  <answer248101> Yes and no. You can change the default emoji font used by Mac OS X, but I don't think you can change it to Google's Noto fonts, although that may depend on your version of OS X.  Basically if you have a font file in .ttf format that contains emoji, you can replace Apple's emoji font with that font using the following steps:  ol liIgnore the default location for Apple's emoji located in system/library/fonts. In other words, leave this alone./li liObtain another emoji font file. HINT: The emojione font is similar to Google's./li liRename your other emoji ttf font file to Apple Color Emoji.ttf/li liMove the newly renamed font file to the /library/fonts folder. /li /ol  I know the above process works for El Capitan, but your situation may be different.  <answer248146> No, you can't.  Apple uses different type of ColorEmoji font, SBIX if I'm not mistaken, Google uses another different CBDT/CBLC format, so they are incompatible for each other.  If you want to use Google's NotoColorEmoji, you need to decompile ttf file, and recompile it as Apple compatible version.  <comment306076> Be aware that whatever font you use locally will not affect what recipients of your emails or messages will see -- that is determined by the font which they have installed locally. <comment306078> That's fine I just don't want to look at Apple's font anymore <comment306085> Try installing the Google font and deactivating Apple Color Emoji and see if it works. <comment306187> running `sudo cp Downloads/NotoColorEmoji-unhinted/NotoColorEmoji.ttf /library/fonts/Apple\ Color\ Emoji.ttf` doesn't change anything for some reason. <comment306195> Can you clarify what version of Mac OS X you're running? <comment307697> Did you give my answer a go? Did it work for you or not? <comment307736> I tried this out with emojione, which is cool. That works, but there's an [issue](https://github.com/Ranks/emojione/issues/176) with character rendering on macs using emojione's font. go figure! <comment307745> Thanks, I just wanted to confirm whether my answer worked for you, so others with the same question know how to do this also. I'm glad it did work. As for the issue people have with the emojione font, that's an interesting read. Thanks for sharing. Hopefully that's not an for other emoji fonts users may decide to use on their Macs. <comment354201> You could also build it directly from the [source](https://github.com/googlei18n/noto-emoji/), without the need for decompiling, which you can do with [Emoji Tools](https://github.com/MitchTalmadge/Emoji-Tools). <comment354203> Apple still only supports its custom `sbix` table for color/emoji fonts. It's PNG-based like Google's `CBDT`+`CBLC` Opentype variant. [Transtype](https://www.fontlab.com/font-converter/transtype/) claims to be able to convert such fonts in a user-friendly way.
