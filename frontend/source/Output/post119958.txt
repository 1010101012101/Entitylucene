How I can copy to the clipboard the path (or the full url) of a file or a folder? <body> It's very annoying to always have to open the codeInformation about.../code window to get the path of a folder or a file.  Is there something like a contextual menu to get the codeurl/code or the path of any file or folder?  <answer119963> This is sort of easy.  Select the file and then kbdCommand-C/kbd will put the path to the file in the clipboard. If you then paste into the Terminal you will get the entire path, unfortunately most other apps you will just get the filename.  hr  If you want the full path then you can create an Automator Service to do it easily :-  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aYrcc.png" alt="enter image description here"  Create a new Automator service and change the 'strongService receives Selected/strong' to : emFiles or folders/em  And the strongin/strong  to the emFinder/em application.  Add a strongCopy to Clipboard/strong Action and Save the Service.  You can now select a file, right click to get a contextual menu and select your service in the Service submenu.  The path will be in the clipboard ready for you to paste. You can even set a keyboard shortcut for it if you like.  Originally I used a Run Applescript Action to get the Posix path to the file and pass it on to the strongCopy to Clipboard/strong Action.  But I discovered all you needed is to have the selection passed directly to the strongCopy to Clipboard/strong Action.   This improved on the Applescript because the Applescript could only deal with one item being selected as written.  But now you can select multiple files and get multiple paths in the clipboard without writing any code.  <answer120232> You can assign a shortcut to a script like this:  precodetell application "Finder" to set s to selection as alias list if s is {} then return set out to "" repeat with f in s     set out to out &amp; POSIX path of f &amp; linefeed end repeat set the clipboard to out /code/pre  There was a bug in 10.7 and 10.8 that made it difficult to get the codeselection/code property reliably, but it was fixed in 10.9. (Finder ignored windows that were created after the last time focus was moved to another application and back.) If you use 10.7 or 10.8, add these lines to the start of the script:  precodeactivate application "SystemUIServer" activate application "Finder" /code/pre  <answer211983> On OS X "El Capitan",   kbdOption/kbd+kbdCommand/kbd+kbdC/kbd the selected file/folder  OR  ol likbdoption/kbd strongright/strong click the file/folder (in Finder)/li liSelect 'strongCopy "file/folder" as Pathname/strong'./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7NBXH.png" alt="Copy &quot;file/folder&quot; as Pathname"     Copy file path in Finder      You now have the option to copy the path to a   file without copying the file itself, perfect for working with files   stored on a server. To copy the file path, right-click the file in the   Finder, and then hold the Option key down and choose Copy as Pathname.

I would like to vote your answer up but first, can I suggest you edit your answer to Just reflect that. The applescript you use will break if more than one item is selected. And your discovery covers both single and multiple options. <comment140001> @markhunte Unfortunately I'm at work without a Mac for the next eight hours to put in a new screen shot. Might manage it at lunch :) otherwise it's when I get home tonight. <comment140009> @TonyWilliams, Sorted. <comment140016> @markhunte Thanks. I was just about to go and "fix" a computer in the Student Office so I could get 15 minutes on a Mac. <comment140111> It's not working with `Sublime` :( <comment140118> cmd+I? Or having finder show the file path bar? Or right clicking the file icon in the Finder window? <comment140124> I meant cmd+i. Thanks <comment140146> @Colas - is it working to paste the results in any editor? Try TextEdit first. <comment140171> I am not talking of the script but of the tip! <comment258023> select the file and then click while holding the alt(option) key: see "copy name" as pathname. <comment267409> I had a service for this, but it was buggy. +1 for mentioning El Capitan added this; did not know
