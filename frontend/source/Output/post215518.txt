Siri is called repeatedly out of control <body> I face a problem with Iphone 6. In the middle of work (particularly listening to podcasts), Siri wrongly thinks she is being called, pauses the main work, and starts asking for order.  Edit: "Hey Siri" is not allowed in my settings.  ol liIs it a hardware or software problem? /li liIs this a common problem?/li liA suggestion for a good way to solve it?/li /ol  <comment260312> Switch off "Hey Siri" in Settings  General  Siri <comment260321> "Hey Siri" is already off and this happens. <comment260322> Then I'd suspect possible dirt/contamination issues with the Home button.
