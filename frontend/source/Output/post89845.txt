How can I record music from a MIDI keyboard with a MacBook Pro? <body> I would like to use our MacBook Pro to record music my daughter plays on her MIDI keyboard as well as her voice. What kind of hardware/software do I need for this?  <answer89849> There are many brands of MIDI to USB adapters available on the market. They cost about US$40 or less. Here is one example, the M-Audio Uno.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bDqgy.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  She can record her performances on GarageBand, which is a piece of Apple software that comes free with the MacBook Pro.  <comment105550> Thanks!  Will see about getting one and investigating how GarageBand works.  I may be back!
