brew doctor warning about Python config scripts <body> Can someone please explain what I should do about the following warning from Homebrew:  precodeWarning: "config" scripts exist outside your system or Homebrew directories. `./configure` scripts often look for *-config scripts to determine if software packages are installed, and what additional flags to use when compiling and linking.  Having additional scripts in your path can confuse software installed via Homebrew if the config script overrides a system or Homebrew provided script of the same name. We found the following "config" scripts:  /opt/local/bin/python-config /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/python-config /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/python2-config /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/python2.7-config /code/pre  Aren't these the original Python config files installed by OS X? If so, surely I shouldn't delete them? Are codepython-config/code and codePython2-config/code required if I only use Python 2.7? Should I change my $PATH which is:  precodeOliviers-iMac:~$ echo $PATH /opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin:/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/opt/X11/bin:/usr/local/MacGPG2/bin /code/pre  strongUPDATE/strong:  I successfully uninstalled Macports and removed code/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin/codefrom my $PATH, but I'm still getting the following warning:  precodeWarning: "config" scripts exist outside your system or Homebrew directories. `./configure` scripts often look for *-config scripts to determine if software packages are installed, and what additional flags to use when compiling and linking.  Having additional scripts in your path can confuse software installed via Homebrew if the config script overrides a system or Homebrew provided script of the same name.

Thank you in advance.  <comment147273> If you have /opt/local/bin on path and in config you have installed Macports and different package managers don't work together in general <comment147278> Yes, I do have Macports installed. Are you suggesting I remove /opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin from my $PATH? What's the solution you recommend here? <comment147279> The general answer is use Macports or Homebrew - so delete one of them
