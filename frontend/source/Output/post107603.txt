What prevents export of a private key from Mavericks keychain? <body> In Mac OS X Mavericks, I'm not able to export a private key from keychain. I'm getting the following error message:br  strong/* In dark wake, no UI possible *//strong  Searching it in Apple documentation fetched the following details:  strongvalue: -25320/strong  strongDescription: The user interface could not be displayed because the system is in a dark wake state. Available in OS X v10.7 and later./strong  Can someone please suggest a solution or the cause of problem?  <answer114574> It appears that your system was mistaken about being asleep (because an internal flag it used to keep track of sleep state got out of sync with the true state). As you confirmed later, a reboot fixes this problem.  <comment126169> How are you doing the export? The error code would suggest that youâ€™re doing it through, e.g. an ssh login or some other non-interactive method. <comment126172> doing from keychain, by right clicking on the key and selecting export. <comment126177> Hmm, it appears your system was mistaken about being asleep, then. Does a reboot fix the issue? <comment126312> yes. reboot fixed the issue. I am now able to export the key. Dont know why it happened in the first place. <comment134154> @microtherion Please answer this question so that it can be marked as answered.
