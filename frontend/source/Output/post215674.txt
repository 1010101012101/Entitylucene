Contact picture not connect with Faces on Photo <body> Each time I'm going to select a face picture for my contact in the MacBook Pro (Mid. 2010 OS X 10.11) and I select the option codeFaces/code the window display the following message:  precodeFind and organise photos of &lt;name_of_the_contact&gt; in the photo app using Faces.  /code/pre  The problem here is that I would like to choose a photo among the available pics in the Photo app for my contacts. Obviously I set one pics in the app Photo but these are not present in the list when I edit the photo in the contacts app. The two app appear to be not related each other.   Someone have had the same problem and maybe solve it?      <answer215694> I think you may have hit the difference between the old handling of Faces &amp; the new.   If your Face is tagged as 'john', &amp; 'john' is not in your Contacts list, it cannot find him.br If he's tagged as John Smith - john.smith@me.com then he can be found.   The only way to associate the two is to click the name under the face in Photos, start typing the name, then pick john.smith@me.com instead of just 'john'.  Then when you go back to Contacts, it can associate the Faces selection with the appropriate Contact.  Here's an example using some Davids - the top ones are my 'Faces' as I already have them; underneath are the same people as 'Contacts' which is imho a lot less 'chummy' but how you must tag people before they will correctly link as Contacts.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/w2imZ.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment260567> I tried but this doesn't solve my problem. <comment260571> thenâ€¦ you did it wrong, In the above pictorial example, completing that 'Face' by selecting 'David K' will not work in Contacts. Selecting 'david[blur] @ .co.uk will then allow Contacts to associate the photos. It's immediate, you don't even need to relaunch either app.
