Pair a bluetooth mouse with the keyboard <body> I have an iMac running OS 10.4.2. It used to have a wired mouse, but it doesn't work any more. I have a Magic Mouse (the kind that takes AA batteries) that was paired with another Mac before. I'd like to pair it with this one.   I can use CMD+space to open system preferences and see that the mouse is discovered. However I can't figure out how to access the pair button with the keyboard.   I've tried CTRL+F7 to change the way tabs move focus. That still doesn't let me focus the pair button.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cPS5k.png" alt="screenshot identifying the pair button"  <answer287211> Found a solution.  ol liCMD+SPACE to open spotlight search./li liEnter "mouse" and select the "Mouse" system preferences panel (probably the first item that comes up)./li liCTRL+F7 (or CTRL+Fn+F7) to change the way the tabs move focus./li liTab until "Set up Bluetooth device" is in focus. /li liSpace to press the button./li liTurn the mouse off and back on to put it pairing mode./li liThe mouse should come up in the list of devices. Tab to focus it, then space to pair. /li /ol  Normally, by the time you get to step 2, OS X will automatically attempt to locate your mouse. In this case, the computer was already paired with some other mouse (which I can't find) so it didn't do that.   <answer287214> Another option which should work, if you want to access this straight from the Bluetooth menu, is to run this AppleScript. It'll iterate through each device in the Bluetooth window, until it comes across one named "Patrick's mouse (home)", which is the one you want to pair, in this case. It'll then click the "Pair" button:  precodetell application "System Events" to tell application process "System Preferences" to tell table 1 of scroll area 1 of window 1     repeat with currentRow in rows         tell UI element 1 of currentRow             if exists (static text "Patrick's mouse (home)") then                 click button "Pair"             end if         end tell     end repeat end tell /code/pre  <comment362534> Can you send a screenshot of what the window looks like exactly? I could help you from there. <comment362535> Take a screenshot, open a brower, navigate to this question, edit the question, and find and upload the screenshot -- without a mouse? Gimme a few minutes. :) <comment362536> Is this just the normal bluetooth pair that you're trying to access? <comment362537> @William Added a screenshot. Had to use a different computer because I can't log in to Stack Exchange via Google with the keyboard. :) <comment362538> ah, gotcha. One sec. <comment362539> Does the "Mouse" section of system preferences do anything? <comment362541> Thanks. It turns out this computer is already paired with some other mouse (which I can't find) so it didn't automatically search. But trying that panel again did lead me to a solution (see answer).
