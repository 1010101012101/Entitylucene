How to securely delete versions in mac os lion <body> I know, that there is a possibility to delete selected versions in Mac OS Lion. Is there a way to emsecurely/em delete versions?  Although I already deleted the versions by now, that I wanted to delete, but what way can I make sure, that any remains of those version is removed? (Technically: not just the inode is removed, but also it's content.)  <answer53930> I can't think of a targeted way to do this, but this should do the trick. Delete the versions that you want to delete using the method outlined in the question you linked to. Then use Disk Utility's "Erase Free Space" option (or codediskutil secureErase freespace [level] [device]/code) to write over the data.
