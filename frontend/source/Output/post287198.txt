How can I view a YouTube playlist's full name? <body> In the YouTube iOS app, a playlist's name will be truncated if it's too log to fit on a single line. Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be an obvious way to view the playlist's full title if it's been shortened.  strongIs it possible to view a playlist's full name if it's been auto-shortened?/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YGXOq.jpg" alt="truncated YouTube playlist name"  <answer287208> ol liHit the Share button that looks like a right-pointing arrow /li liChoose "Twitter" from the list/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MlYpV.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer287209> If you have a twitter account you can tap codeShare -&gt; Twitter/code to see full name of playlist.  <comment362524> Is it a latest version of YouTube app? <comment362526> @AndreyKuznetsov Yes.
