Mail shows 2 unread but there are no emails <body> Recently my Mail app is giving me the 2 unread badge, but there are no mail messages in the inbox:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dmsSq.jpg" alt="2 unread" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IzTTM.jpg" alt="pulled down to censor folders."  I do not remember when this started. I am on 9.3 beta but it started on 9.2 before I upgraded (using OTA).   Also, the hotmail I use does not sync trashing so my hotmail inbox includes all emails that I have deleted from my inbox.   <answer224832> Go to your Inbox, drag messages down slightly, Search field will appear. Start typing 'Unread' and filter will appear. Use it. Probably it will help you locate those two unread messages.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5HeB7.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer242566> Go to “Settings” Select “Mail, Contact, Calendars” Select the mail account that shows the unread message. Turn “Mail” to “Off” Turn the iPhone / iPad off by holding down the power button for 5 seconds and slide to power off. Wait for 30 seconds, turn the iPhone / iPad back on. Go to “Settings” Select “Mail, Contact, Calendars” Select the respective Mail account Turn “Mail” back to “On”
