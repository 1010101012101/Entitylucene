In OS X Yosemite, FileVault, "Enable Users" is not available <body> This is an inconsistency I've found compared to Apple docs on this, and to all the answers in forums online, and to another laptop in my care, similarly configured.  My user account is an Admin account.  Even after unlocking the preference pane for FileVault, "Enable Users" is not an option. Every help page or web search I've found has shown the "Enable Users" button in a screenshot of the prefs pane.  However, other users can still log in from the login screen!  Can anyone explain this behavior? I need to know what's up so I can administer my office's population of 20 or so Mac users.

You may test this yourself: open Terminal and enter:  precodesudo fdesetup list /code/pre  to list all FileVault enabled users  Remove one user:  precodesudo fdesetup remove -user user_name /code/pre  wait a few seconds and open emSystem Preferences/em  emSecurity &amp; Privacy/em  emFileVault/em.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/THeBP.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WK5Y7.png" alt="enter image description here"  Quit emSystem Preferences/em  emSecurity &amp; Privacy/em  emFileVault/em.  Add the user again:  precodesudo fdesetup add -usertoadd user_name /code/pre  and enter some passwords/recovery keys.  Open emSystem Preferences/em  emSecurity &amp; Privacy/em  emFileVault/em et voilà: the button is gone.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4qx4C.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment298698> Thanks. Thing that I don't understand is that I did add a couple of users, but I never added them to FileVault. Are new users added to FV automatically in some circumstances? <comment298701> @JDS New users added after enabling FV or all users configured before enabling FV are added automatically
