iTunes music sync is not updating play count <body> I love to use different music and always update my playlists with different music and songs. In order to better organize and maintain I use play count feature in iTunes. After a month if I listened songs very less, I used to delete to create space for new music.  However recently installed updates in my both mac and my iPhone. The latest versions are iOS 8.4, iTunes 12.2.0.145 and OS in my mac is 10.10.4  After this, I have noticed the play count is not updating. Is there any reason? Am I missing anything?
