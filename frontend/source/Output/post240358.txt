Problems Connecting Canon Powershot to 2015 Macbook Air <body> I have a Canon Powershot G12, and I am attempting to get some files over onto my Macbook Air. This is the first time I attempted to do this, I normally upload them onto my Macbook Pro. But when I do connect it, it shows up as "Remote Disk", and there are no files in the "Remote Disk". Do I have to install a driver?  <answer240359> Yes, you need driver &amp; software for your Canon PowerShot G12.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4Boj5m.jpg" alt="PowerShot G12 driver support"
