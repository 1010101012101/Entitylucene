Viewing and Managing iTunes Downloads <body> I am on iTunes 12.5.1.21 on OS X El Capitan 10.11.3. I would like to know where (by default) downloads are written (I am downloading many iTunes U lectures in sequence).  Window  Activity shows me active downloads which I can pause and cancel, but that isn't exactly what I need.  I can also click the tiny arrow at the top right of the iTunes navbar that shows up when you are downloading something, but it just gives me the same tools as Window  Activity.  <answer256384> I believe the answer, in a default configuration, is found within iTunes Preferences:  ul liWith iTunes open, enter Preferences (kbdCommand/kbd kbd, /kbd)  /li liAdvanced Tab. /li liNote the "iTunes Media Folder Location".  It defaults to code/Users/myusername/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/code  /li liWithin that folder is a codeDownloads/code folder, which holds an codeiTunes U/code folder, which is where my files were stored (.m4v formatted)  /li /ul  TL;DR: Your default download location is code/Users/yourusername/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Downloads/code  <answer256490> Two other easy options to find where an iTunes file is downloaded:  (1.) Locate the file in your libary, right-click it, select "Get Info" and go to the "File" tab to see the full path.  (2.) Locate the file in your libary, right-click it, select "Show in Finder" if, for example, you want to play the media in a different application.  <comment319868> Media should be sorted into folders by type in the iTunes Media directory, not Downloads. Downloads is a temporary directory used while files are in the process of actually being downloaded. Also note that the default iTunes Media Folder Location is _the directory above_ the iTunes Media folder. By default, that is ~/Music/iTunes. <comment319967> These are also good options, but only work when the download is complete, no? <comment319969> Not sure. If it's a tiny 1GB lecture, and the download is taking a while, I'd suggest upgrading your internet. (Assuming you don't live in Australia.)
