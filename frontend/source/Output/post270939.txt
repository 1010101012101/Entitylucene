'Go to Folder' disabled from new Finder window <body> When I open a new Finder window, i.e. kbd⌘ N/kbd  I am unable to access the 'Go To Folder' option. (Either via the 'Go' menu, or kbd⌘ Shift G/kbd)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dYmUl.png" width="300"  However, I've noticed the option is available within the Open dialog of another application (e.g. TextEdit).  Is there anyway to make this option available in a new Finder window?  OSX 10.12.1  <answer270949> It's possible the feature has been disabled. You can delete the override using the following:  precodedefaults delete com.apple.finder ProhibitGoToFolder &amp;&amp; killall -HUP Finder /code/pre  <comment340695> Unfortunately this fails with: `Domain (com.apple.finder) not found. Defaults have not been changed.`
