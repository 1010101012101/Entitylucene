Contact names are gone, but still shown in Messages <body> My iPhone 6's contact names are gone, but the numbers are still there.  emHowever/em when I go to messaging and add a new message and type for a contact by name, all the contacts show up with strongboth/strong the name and the message. Therefore I know that the iPhone still has the names stored somewhere, because it shows up when searching in the messaging search.  What can I do to get all my contact names back, because I know that they strongare/strong stored somewhere.  I don't have any backups, but I shouldn't need any, because my device seems to have the contact names emsomewhere/em, as I see them when I add a message and search.  <answer231892> Try these possible fixes :  ol liSettings  Mail, Contacts, Calendars  iCloud  toggle Contacts on and off/li /ol  The Second fix only applies if you have multiple email accounts synced with your iPhone (iCloud,Gmail etc) :  ol start="2" liSettings  Mail, Contacts, Calendars  Gmail or whichever you use  toggle Contacts on and off /li /ol  Also check the Default Account in Settings to see which email account is selected.  <answer251543> This happened to me. I had deleted my gmail account because it was taking up too much space. I remembered the changes I made before the contact names deleted. I restored the account and my contact names were restored. Then I imported the contacts to sim from gmail and cloud so they would save.   <comment283271> No backups, in this day & age? What happens if the phone gets lost, stolen or broken?
