"Show Password" in Keychain Access doesn't work <body> I am having a problem, as a program is requesting my RSA password but my Mac won't let me see it. As I check the "show password" (mostrar contraseña) chechbox, it immediately unmarks itself.   I already tried "Repair" and turning the computer off and on again (as if it ever worked) and of course, it didn't fix it.  Any suggestions?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hwvLV.png" alt="show password on keychain"  <answer216158> Locking and unlocking the Keychain helped in my case. It's the lock icon in the upper left corner of the application's window.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DNGWK.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer224340> I had probably the same problem, I changed my Keychain password to my login password ie. they are equal now.

You can right click on that item of which you need the password and click on "copy the password to clipboard", then you will ask to enter the login password , after that you can paste the password where you want. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dSPcj.png" alt="enter image description here"  PFA:  <comment217979> Is your keychain locked or unlocked (look at top left corner (the lock icon) <comment218146> I can't see my p/w on that file either - not that I have any clue really what it's for or whether I ever gave it a p/w in the first place. I can see the p/w on `ids: identity-rsa-key-pair-signature-v1` but not on public or private key. <comment219109> @Buscar웃 It is unlocked. <comment303710> Yikes! It took a couple of clicks before it would lock, but now it won't unlock (clicking on the lock does nothing), and the password I was looking for disappeared!
