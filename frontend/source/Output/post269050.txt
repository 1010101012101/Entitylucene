I want all visited links to have the same color <body> It seems like there should be a simple way for all links that I have clicked on to be highlighted in some way or have a color that stands out. I have not been able to find a universal way to do this on a Macbook Air.  I am currently using Mac OS 10.11.6 El Capitan, and the Safari and Chrome browsers.  Thanks for any help.  <answer269060> In Safari you can create a custom style sheet and import it in Safari:  E.g. in Terminal enter:  precodeecho 'a:visited { color: red !important; }' &gt;&gt; ~/Library/Safari/link.css /code/pre  Then open Safari  Preferences  Advanced  Style Sheet  Other... and choose the links.css.  In older Chrome versions you can modify the file ~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome/Default/User\ StyleSheets/Custom.css (usually a 0 Bytes file) and add the same line:  precodeecho 'a:visited { color: red !important; }' &gt;&gt; ~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome/Default/User\ StyleSheets/Custom.css /code/pre  hr  The support for custom stylesheets has been removed in newer Chrome versions. Here I recommend an extension: Stylist.  <comment338014> To be safe, use "" instead of "". If the file already exists, the single will erase it and replace it with the new entry whereas the double will append the new entry to the end of a the existing file or create a file if it doesn't exist yet. <comment338015> @Kent Done! Thanx for the hint ;-)
