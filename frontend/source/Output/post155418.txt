Finder Menu Services No Longer Working <body> In Pre-Yosemite, I had some finder menu services (i.e. Right-Click, see 'Services' in menu, hover over, and you'd see Services created in Automator) that I made. As a developer, these were very handy as I'd often have to rename a emlarge/em amount of files to some criteria (i.e. removing/replacing/adding text). I can make services fine now, and even get them to work emwithin/em Automator (dragging and dropping the file(s) into Automator). However, if I right-click the file(s), hover over 'Service' and select my service, it strongemnever/em/strong runs. In fact, if I check codeActivity Monitor/code, I see 'Automator Runner' just hanging there (one for each time I try). I have tried restarting and logging out and in. This doesn't fix it.  Note: I am running OS X Yosemite.  <answer215159> Open and re-save your services in Automator.  This will update them to work with Yosemite, and also warn you of any incompatibilities with the actions you're using in the services.  As a side note, this definitely should be something you're notified about when trying to run an old service, but at least you don't need to re-create new duplicate services.  <comment182821> May be a good idea to show what you have in the Automator actions!! <comment182822> @markhunte For testing purposes, I made a service that simply does 'Copy Finder Items' to 'Desktop'. Doesn't work. <comment237827> Did you ever fix this? I have the same problem. <comment237828> Actually, I just fixed it. I had a dozen Automator Runner tasks not responding in Activity Monitor and I had to kill one to get the services to work again. This probably was a different issue than yours, since even restarting didn't fix it. <comment259844> I've noticed the ScriptMonitor is hanging when I try to run my Automator based services. If I quit it when its process hangs, the Automator script runs.
