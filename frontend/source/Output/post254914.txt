How to mount certain SD cards to a specific mountpoint in El Capitan? <body> Desired behavior:  When SD card1 (codeLABEL=NIKON D60/code) or SD card2 (codeLABEL=NIKON D70/code) is put into cardreader, it automatically gets mounted to code/media/digicam/code. I run a script, which copies the files to my SSD, renames them with timestamps and rotates them if necessary.  What I tried:  Both cards are formatted in fat32. I tried to create a code/etc/fstab/code with codesudo nano /etc/fstab/code containing the following line:  codeLABEL=NIKON\ D60 /media/digicam vfat rw,auto/code  After rebooting the card still gets mounted in code/Volumes/NIKON D60/code automatically.  How to stop the automount to code/Volumes/.../code for those cards and get them to mount to my desired folder?  <answer254955> The following two conditions must be met:  ol liThe mount point must already exist./li liSpaces in the Label Name need to be escaped with an octal space character, e.g.: code\040/code/li /ol  As a test, I did the following:  ul liRelabeled one of my FAT32 formatted SD Cards to codeNIKON D60/code then ejected and removed it./li liCreated the code/media/digicam/code directory using: codesudo mkdir -p /media/digicam/code/li liAdded codeLABEL=NIKON\040D60 /media/digicam msdos rw,auto 0 0/code to: code/etc/fstab/code/li /ul  I then inserted the SD Card and it mounted as expected, it appeared in Finder as NIKON D60 and its Mount Point showed in Disk Utility as: code/media/digicam/code
