Why is softwareupdated taking up all my memory? <body> The process softwareupdated seems to be taking up way too much memory. It can take up to 400 MB RAM sometimes. I can't nail down what is causing this to happen, so I've been watching my console closely. I've narrowed one incident to a 15 minute period, but I still can't see what might be causing this. I am attaching the console output below. Usually softwareupdated only takes up 18 MB. When it gets up to 400 MB, it won't ever go back down unless I restart my computer. Its like it can't release the memory or something. Its very frustrating since it slows my computer down considerably. I have also had my computer freeze a few times requiring a manual shutdown. It seems the problems started with update 10.10.2, but this may be a coincidence.  edit: Here are some updated screenshots when the process is acting up. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zRGet.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IkweE.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kdmIf.png" alt="enter image description here" Has anyone else experienced this? What can I do to fix this?   precode3/5/15 4:23:17.000 PM kernel[0]: MacAuthEvent en1   Auth result for: b8:8d:12:61:0a:e5  MAC AUTH succeeded 3/5/15 4:23:17.000 PM kernel[0]: wlEvent: en1 en1 Link UP virtIf = 0 3/5/15 4:23:17.000 PM kernel[0]: AirPort: RSN handshake complete on en1 3/5/15 4:23:17.000 PM kernel[0]: wl0: Roamed or switched channel, reason #1, bssid b8:8d:12:61:0a:e5 3/5/15 4:23:17.000 PM kernel[0]: en1: BSSID changed to b8:8d:12:61:0a:e5 3/5/15 4:23:17.000 PM kernel[0]: en1: channel changed to 11 3/5/15 4:23:17.000 PM kernel[0]: en1::IO80211Interface::postMessage bssid changed 3/5/15 4:23:21.000 PM kernel[0]: MacAuthEvent en1   Auth result for: b8:8d:12:61:0a:e5  MAC AUTH succeeded 3/5/15 4:23:21.000 PM kernel[0]: wlEvent: en1 en1 Link UP virtIf = 0 3/5/15 4:23:21.000 PM kernel[0]: wl0: Roamed or switched channel, reason #8, bssid b8:8d:12:61:0a:e5 3/5/15 4:23:21.000 PM kernel[0]: en1: BSSID changed to b8:8d:12:61:0a:e5 3/5/15 4:23:21.000 PM kernel[0]: en1: channel changed to 11 3/5/15 4:23:21.000 PM kernel[0]: en1::IO80211Interface::postMessage bssid changed 3/5/15 4:23:22.000 PM kernel[0]: AirPort: RSN handshake complete on en1 3/5/15 4:24:36.256 PM storeaccountd[259]: AccountServiceDelegate: Accepting new connection &lt;NSXPCConnection: 0x7fe1e0d067c0&gt; connection from pid 1955 with interface &lt;AccountServiceInterface: 0x7fe1e0d07cb0&gt; (PID 1955) 3/5/15 4:24:36.591 PM com.apple.xpc.launchd[1]: (com.apple.imfoundation.IMRemoteURLConnectionAgent) The _DirtyJetsamMemoryLimit key is not available on this platform. 3/5/15 4:24:38.838 PM com.apple.xpc.launchd[1]: (com.apple.imfoundation.IMRemoteURLConnectionAgent) The _DirtyJetsamMemoryLimit key is not available on this platform. 3/5/15 4:24:39.043 PM com.apple.iCloudHelper[1962]: objc[1962]: Class FALogging is implemented in both /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/FamilyCircle.framework/Versions/A/FamilyCircle and /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/FamilyNotification.framework/Versions/A/FamilyNotification.

If you open up your Activity Monitor, you will likely see that the memory pressure (the important number) is green.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2f9f2.png" alt="enter image description here"  As long as you aren't in yellow, the system will use RAM as it sees fit, so strongthere's really no problem with the numbers you report/strong. All your RAM isn't committed, there's no point in the system reducing allocations with no pressure.  Also, consider control clicking on the memory column (when viewing memory) and select all the memory items. You can then update the post with real/private/shared memory footprint as well as the nominal memory size.  You could also double click on the line item for strongsoftwareupdated/strong to inspect it:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rd7zm.png" alt="enter image description here"  The real thing to track will be to write down the exact time of each freeze and dig into the logs when that happens. Ram usage by the update daemon is almost certainly not the cause of that instability.  <answer193932> Just kill the process in Activity monitor  <comment207010> Thanks for the help. I will continue to monitor my system. 400 MB is not of great concern to me, its just the computer starts behaving badly at the same time that softwareupdated acts up. i hope you are right, but I have never noticed this behavior before. I still am usually working in the green, but it is becoming a bigger challenge on my 2011 Macbook Pro with 4 GB of RAM. <comment208715> My `softwareupdated` is 437MB, although the "compressed mem" column is 404MB which could mean that it's only actually occupying 30MB? Regardless, it does seem excessive, especially since there doesn't seem to be any reason for `softwareupdated` to run in the background at all. It's the second biggest process after `kernel_task` for me. <comment208724> Here are two reasons to load it in the background. It launches at boot and then all the memory and code are set so that when you choose to run an update (or a urgent security update is issued), you don't get a failure due to other processes taking the ram. Most people enable periodic checks and this is the worker that does the checks throughout the day and month. <comment229583> I’m getting this too. <comment281889> I have 32gb in my 10.10.5 Yosemite iMac with Memory pressure in the Yellow and softwareupdated is still taking up 550MB. My uptime is 21 days. Time for a reboot.
