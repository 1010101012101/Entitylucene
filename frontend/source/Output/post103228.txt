Homebrew: Easy way to add 'gnubin' to path for multiple packages? <body> I would like to use Homebrew to install GNU versions of several utilities, and use the GNU versions by default with their usual names.  From the output of codebrew install gnu-tar/code and by reading How to replace Mac OS X utilities with GNU core utilities? I learned that I can add code/usr/local/opt/gnu-tar/libexec/gnubin/code to my code$PATH/code variable. However, for other packages, the codegnubin/code directory is under a different path, like code/usr/local/opt/coreutils/libexec/gnubin/code for the codecoreutils/code package.  Do I have to add each of these to my path by hand, or does Homebrew provide an easy way to collect all of the entries in various codegnubin/code directories into one place?  I suppose I could put some kind of auto-finding script in my code.bash_profile/code like:  precodeGNUBINS=$(find -L /usr/local/opt -type d -name gnubin | tr ' ' ':') export PATH=$GNUBINS:$PATH /code/pre  However this feels a little clunky and insecure, and I was hoping for a Homebrew-specific solution.  <answer114165> You don't have codehomebrew/bin/code directory?  I am using Boxen (including Homebrew) at work, Homebrew is installed to code/opt/boxen/homebrew/code.  I have code/opt/boxen/homebrew/bin/code directory with links to all the Homebrew utilities.  codecoreutils/code is a bunch of commands, not a single formula, so I think you still need to add it to your codePATH/code but you should not have to do this for other GNU software like codegnu-sed/code, codegawk/code or codefindutils/code if you install them with code--default-names/code option.  Here is a simple list of my code/opt/boxen/homebrew/bin/code  precode[admin@nzx-mb-125:/opt/boxen/homebrew/bin] : ls -l | grep -i awk lrwxr-xr-x  1 admin  staff   28 16 Dec 16:51 awk -&gt; ../Cellar/gawk/4.1.0/bin/awk lrwxr-xr-x  1 admin  staff   29 16 Dec 16:51 gawk -&gt; ../Cellar/gawk/4.1.0/bin/gawk lrwxr-xr-x  1 admin  staff   35 16 Dec 16:51 gawk-4.1.0 -&gt; ../Cellar/gawk/4.1.0/bin/gawk-4.1.0 lrwxr-xr-x  1 admin  staff   30 16 Dec 16:51 igawk -&gt; ../Cellar/gawk/4.1.0/bin/igawk [admin@nzx-mb-125:/opt/boxen/homebrew/bin] : ls -l | grep -i sed lrwxr-xr-x  1 admin  staff   31 16 Dec 16:52 sed -&gt; ../Cellar/gnu-sed/4.2.2/bin/sed /code/pre  <comment133874> thanks for the formatting tips, I will keep that in mind in future. <comment134005> I do not appear to have `homebrew/bin`. I guess that would be specific to Boxen. If I find that I need to link a lot of GNU binaries, I'll consider giving Boxen a try.
