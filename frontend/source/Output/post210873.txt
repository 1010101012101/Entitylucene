Recording bar shows up in chat bar; can't remove <body> Ever since I upgraded to 9.0, a recording bar sporadically shows up in my text input window: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1i09T.png" alt="enter image description here"  It overlays on text that I try to type.  I know I'm doing it, but I don't know how I'm doing it; nor do I know how remove it.    I cannot select it, changing keyboard layout via "123" or ":)" doesn't changing anything.    The only way I know how to remove is by turning the phone off and back on.    How do I remove this bar?  <comment254543> I had this bug on a iOS9 beta... I didn't find how to fix it :/ You are in 9.0 or 9.0.2 ? <comment254628> @MrMojoRisin 9.0.2
