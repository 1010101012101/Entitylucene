How to turn off iPhone 5 Edge/GPRS? <body> My friend has just got an iPhone 5 for the first time and she is having problem with turning off the EDGE/GPRS connection.  She would turn off 3G connection in the codesetting/code but there seems to be nowhere to turn off EDGE or GPRS.  <answer76903> go to :  ul liSettings/li liGeneral /li liCellular/li /ul  Set cellular data to OFF  <comment89165> Why do you want to turn off EDGE ? <comment89175> You can turn off Cellular Data in Settings  General Cellular  Cellular Data. How did she turn off *just* the 3G connection? <comment89190> @MatthieuRiegler The reason is to control when to go online, e.g. prefer to logged in facebook with wifi only <comment89191> When wifi is available. iPhone will only use the Wifi, not the cellular network. <comment89193> @MatthieuRiegler I mean she doesn't want to be still logged in facebook when she goes outside where there's no wifi <comment89194> Then do what bassplayer7 suggested :  turn off Cellular Data in Settings  General Cellular  Cellular Data
