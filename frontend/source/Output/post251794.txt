iOS update with no Internet connection <body> I have a question about the iOS update. When the device was connected to the Internet it has successfully downloaded the update, verified and scheduled its installation at night. The problem is, when it was installed and the device was rebooted, now it keeps asking to connect to the internet to finish the installation, but there is no internet connection in that place. Is it possible to finish the update without the internet connection, or cancel the update and return to the previous version? At the moment, it is not possible to get to the home screen and to the settings, as the update was not finished.  Also, there is no computer with iTunes on it to connect the device to it. So, there is just an iPad with no Internet connection and unfinished iOS update.
