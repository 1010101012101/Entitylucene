Can't save files in my own directory due to insane permission error <body> I was working on my mac and saved a file. Continued to work on the file. One hour later, when I tried to save that file, I saw the message "The document could not be saved. You don't have permission". What??? Now I see I cannot save any of my files. I can open them, but I cannot save. Any file. But this is selective. TextEdit can save the files, Mail.app can open emails and save attachments. Xcode can create and save new projects, but I cannot modify them, or I will see the error if I try to save.  This is what I have tried to do:  ul licodechown/code, codechmod -R 755/code, etc. on the directory containing my projects doesn't help./li liDisk Utility  Repair Permissions doesn't help./li liReinstalling the app, clearing their .plists, etc. doesn't help./li liI can create a new project or document with these apps (Xcode and Photoshop for example, just to name a few) and it saves the file on my documents directory, but if I change the document and try to save, I see the error./li liI have rebooted the computer and also turned it off and on./li liI did a safe mode boot and scanned the disk using /sbin/fsck -fy and no issues were found./li liI have deleted all caches and application support files./li liI did a chmod -R -N ~ on my documents directory, suspecting that some ACLs could be the guilty. No change./li liI did a recursive chown to take ownership of my own files. The ownership was correct before, but I just did it again to clean anything that could be wrong./li liI reinstalled both apps and nothing./li /ul  What more I can? Cry?  Thoughts? Thanks  <answer40470> If I understand your question correctly, you're attempting to reset the permissions on a user's home directory. This is easily accomplished by resetting ACLs on the desired home directly by using the strongReset Password utility/strong in the Recovery Partition:  ul liRestart your computer from the recovery partition (if running Lion) or the gray disk (if not running Lion). /li liOpen Disk Utility and run a permissions repair on your startup volume. /li liAfter this is complete, close Disk Utility and open strongTerminal/strong from the Utilities menu. /li liType in coderesetpassword/code and select your user account (NOT System Administrator/root) from the drop down menu. /li liClick the strongReset/strong button at the bottom of the window in the Reset home folder permissions and ACLs section. /li liQuit the Password Utility and go back to the main recovery screen. On your keyboard, hit kbd&#8984;/kbd strong+/strong kbdQ/kbd and restart your computer./li /ul  It's very important that you don't hold down the power button to exit the recovery session, or the ACL reset won't occur.  Let us know how it goes.  <answer40868> I had the same problem.  I tried what Matt Love has suggested and still had the problems.  I then downloaded Cocktail and ran permission repair, rebooted and all worked again.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oLTyK.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer204730> It may be file ownership issue. Try changing the file's ownership to yourself.   ol liRun Terminal/li liGo to your file's folder/li lirun codesudo chown &lt;your-user-name-here&gt; &lt;file-name-here&gt;/code ORbr codesudo chown -R &lt;your-user-name-here&gt; &lt;folder-name-here&gt;/code/li /ol  strongWhy does it happen?/strong  One Reason: Sometimes applications or we use "SUDO" (which is to perform actions as a super user)  command to do different things. If any file is created as a super user (which is usually root) then "root" owns that file or folder.  <comment44329> When you say chown and chmod on your directory doesn't work, I presume you sudo'd right? That would force it to accept your permissions if you haven't already. <comment44336> yes, I did it with sudo and did it again now, just in case. <comment44338> I have created another user on my system and everything is fine from there. Something happened to this account, while I was working that made it unusable. What more can I check? thanks. <comment44431> Look at the ACL on directories etc. `ls -le` <comment84115> I'm not keen on recommending third-party software, but in this case it's the only thing that worked. I did first try repairing permissions with Disk Utility, restarting and all that, but to no avail. I run 10.7.5. I did look into upgrading to Mountain Lion but my trusty MacBook is deemed too old. <comment340174> [this answer](https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/270609/55450) might be worth trying.
