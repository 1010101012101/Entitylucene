Reformat iPhone as USB <body> Is it possible to erase and reformat an iPhone to be act as a USB? I've seen many apps that can store data and then you can access it, but is it possible to actually reformat the entire iPhone to behave as a USB?  <answer230964> Not that I know of, no.  However, there is an app called Documents Pro ($5 US, and definitely worth it) that would do something similar to what you want.  The difference is that it connects via WiFi as a network drive as opposed to connecting via USB.  <comment281964> To what end, really? 32GB iPhone, 500 quid/bucks/shekels. 32GB USB stick, a fiver. <comment281993> Tetsujin it's an old iPhone that I just had lying around, so I was curious if I could use it for this purpose. <comment281995> A lot of people turn them into iPods. Drop it in the car glovebox, wire into player, never have to remember again ;-) I did that for years before I got a CarPlay system in the car <comment282018> @Tetsujin that's a great idea actually. Thanks!
