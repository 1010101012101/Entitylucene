Obtaining a list of albums on iTunes that was available during a certain week <body> I sadly failed to preview all the albums released from July 19, 2016 to July 26, 2016 on iTunes (US list). Would you please let me know how I can find a complete list of these albums released during that specified period?  Unfortunately the iTunes "Just Added" link has disappeared from the right-hand list for a month:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UWbnF.jpg" alt="&quot;Just added link"
