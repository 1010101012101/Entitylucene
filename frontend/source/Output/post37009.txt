Disabling Schubert's PDF Browser plugin on Safari <body> I use Safari and Firefox. To be able to view PDFs on Firefox on the fly, I use the Schubert's PDF viewer. But, I would like to block it from loading my PDFs on Safari. I like Safari's way of handling PDFs a bit more. How can I disable a particular plugin on Safari?  Thank you.  <answer37011> For that plugin (which is not a Safari Extension which is handled differently), you have to uninstall the plugin manaully by deleting the file, whcih means you don't get the plugin in Firefox  the support site says.     strongHow do I uninstall PDF Browser Plugin?/strong   In Finder go to /Library/Internet Plug-Ins/ or /Library/Internet Plug-Ins/ and move PDF Browser Plugin to the trash. Then restart your web browser.    Edit: Looking at how the plugin is done, it is installed in Internet plug-ins which means it is Global.  I have looked to see if Firefox will load it from another location but have been unable to get FF to do that.  I've looked at extensions for both Firefox and Safari (such as ClickToPlugin) however you cannot disable a plugin in Safari as you can FF.  So my answer is that it cannot be done with Safari and global plugins.  <answer40611> I found a workaround. Move Schubert's plugin file which is located in:  precode/Library/Internet Plug-Ins/PDF Browser Plugin.plugin /code/pre  or  precode/Users/YOUR_NAME/Library/Internet Plug-Ins/PDF Browser Plugin.plugin /code/pre  to  precode/Users/YOUR_NAME/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/YOUR_PROFILE_DIRECTORY/plugins/ /code/pre  If you don't have codeplugins/code directory - create it. That's all :)  For Opera users - they should move plugin file to:  precodeLibrary/Internet Plug-Ins/Disabled Plug-Ins/ /code/pre  Firefox and Safari don't use plugins from this location, but Opera does :)  <comment42072> That's the thing. I would like to keep it on for Firefox, but not have it interfere with Safari. <comment42094> I think the solution is to place the plugin in a location that only Firefox looks for and not Safari, i'll look into it further
