exporting numbers 09 to excel with photos in spreadsheet <body> When I export my numbers spreadsheet with photos in the column the photos do not transfer when I import it into excel. How can I do this?  <answer91898> There are two ways that an image can exist in Numbers.app, to my knowledge:  ol liWithin a cell (in a table) - here, the cell has an "Image Fill";/li li"On top of" the table./li /ol  Excel doesn't support option 1.  If you drag an image file into a Numbers spreadsheet, you'll get option 1: the image will be inserted within a cell.  Instead, in Numbers, stronguse the Insert  Chooseâ€¦ menu/strong and select the image file.  You'll then get option 2, which is correctly exported to code.xls/code format in my limited testing.  <comment25831> What are you trying to do with pictures in a spreadsheet? <comment36189> I have the same problem. I am making a photo directory. I am trying to export it to excel with the photos so that others can edit it too.
