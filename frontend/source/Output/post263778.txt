Touch ID best practices <body> Is there are any "best practices" for setting up touch id fingers on iPhone?  I know how to setup this, but I believe I may miss some of the unlock scenarios during setup and end up unable to unlock my phone without taking it in hand or one of the "ways" I held it during setup.  <answer263779> Apple does not provide any guidance as to which fingers you should set up. It is purely a matter of personal preference as to which fingers you use based on the ways you hold your device when unlocking.  I suggest adding fingers you consistently use when trying to unlock your device to TouchÂ ID, and removing any fingers you don't use often. In case you didn't label your Touch ID fingerprints, you can see which fingerprint corresponds to which row in Settings by holding your finger on Touch ID when in the Settings page.  <answer263817> I added my two thumbs and my two index fingers. This allows me to unlock the phone with both hands. I find it easier to unlock it when it's resting on my desk with my index fingers.   Plus, I can lose one hand and still unlock my iPhone!  On the second stage ("Adjust your grip") I change my finger position and how I hold the phone to allow for different holding / unlocking scenarios.  <comment330494> Not really, the process of setting-up your fingers will tell you what to do.  That process will cover almost every scenario.  As long as you follow each step in the setup, you should be ok.
