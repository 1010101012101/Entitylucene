Zooming on Xcode on Mac <body> I have seen in many tutorial videos people zoom in and out on Xcode to show the code a little better. I tried with 'control' + 'two finger swipe on trackpad' but this does not work on Xcode. What is the shortcut for zooming on Xcode?  <answer55200> Screen Zoom is a system-wide feature. In Lion, this is part of Universal Access.     The short version is:  Visit System Preferences-Universal Access-Seeing   And set "Zoom" to on.   You'll then be able to scroll using the control key and the scroll gesture of your input device.   Follow the instructions here for more detailed instructions.   <comment63324> Care to point to one of those videos? Zoom in OS X means probably a different thing. <comment63325> MAC is a make up company, I'm assuming you're talking about a mac and/or Mac? <comment63328> Yes. I am using MacBook Pro. <comment63329> It's probably a feature of their screen capture software. <comment63347> It's probably a feature of the capture software, but screen zoom is still a Mac OS feature.  You can enable if you want to.
