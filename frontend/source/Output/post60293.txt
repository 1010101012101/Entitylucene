The following screenshots show you what to do:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kk9FL.png" alt="Create a service"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/c9p8f.png" alt="Set service parameters"  Pay attention "Service receives" part.  Than save a service and activate it as in the post above. This will go into "Services" (not to "Share") though.  <comment69560> Thanks. I tried it and it only works if you highlight the file as text selection, not as file selection. So it grabs the text of the file into Apple Mail instead as a whole file attachment. That's lame or it could be a bug. Well, Mountain Lion is still in its first release, I hope Apple fixes that one on the next 10.8.1 release.
