Unresponsive save dialogs in Preview <body> With the introduction of Mountain Lion, Preview acts up whenever I need to save a file.  It does this regardless of whether I use File  Save or kbdCommand/kbd+kbdS/kbd.  The logs tell the same story:   precode10/20/12 10:54:48.700 PM Preview[56917]: RVS:__54-[NSRemoteSavePanel _runOrderingOperationWithContext:]_block_invoke_0319 : Timeout occured while waiting for the window /code/pre  Right after Preview stops responding, this log shows up and I can use Preview normally again.  This also occurs when I try to codeMove to.../code  from the window menu.    I have all of Mountain Lion's latest updates. Is this a bug just like this and is Apple aware of it?  Is anyone else experiencing these issues and are there known workarounds (besides quitting and re-opening Preview [although it emdoes/em save your work and annotations right before, because of Auto Save...?] or using Skitch).  <answer71796> It seems that a recent restore and fixing permissions and the disk in Disk Utility have cleared up the issue. If it does happen again, however, I will return to this post with a bounty. Also, a recent OS X update seems to have eliminated the issue.  <answer105345> I disabled strongDocuments &amp; Data/strong in strongSystem Preferences  iCloud/strong to make this problem go away.
