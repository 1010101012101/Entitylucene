Can I mirror my iPad's display using the VGA adapter for use in a presentation? <body> I would love to be able to mirror the display of my iPad on a projector for use in a presentation. Is there any software available to do this - on the AppStore or if necessary for use with a jailbroken iPad?  <answer404> There's no official way to achieve this.  You have to jailbreak your iPad and use a software like DisplayOut (works on all iDevices) to do this.  <answer434> As Studer mentioned, there is no official way to do so. you can use the DisplayOut software for Jailbroken iPads.  If you're more developer oriented, there is also  this option  <answer20482> Just for clarification:   With the iPad2, every app is mirrored on the VGA adapter by default, without any additional measures.  <comment374> Wow - that was faster than I expected. :-) <comment375> At your service, Sir.
