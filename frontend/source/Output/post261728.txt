Birthday alerts happening again <body> Birthday alerts - I assume from Facebook - are once again showing on my Mac (not my iPhone which has connected calendars).  I have tried many solutions - such as: https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-turn-off-birthday-notifications-on-my-Mac  (right clicking birthdays on the left doesn't work as it's not in the calendar list. Birthdays is already deselected in Calendar/Preferences/General/Show Birthdays Calendar).  The above fixed it before. Now it's started again with MacOS Sierra (or possibly a Sierra update).  The birthdays are not listed IN the calendar - but the alerts come up.  How can I stop this? It seems to be a new bug?!
