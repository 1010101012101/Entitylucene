How do you homebrew cleanup except to skip specified formula? <body> In Homebrew, to clean up outdated packages, we do codebrew cleanup/code, and currently I have about 9.5GB worth of old packages, pending for removal.   However, I really do not like to remove old python versions. Are there ways to clean up old homebrew packages except codepython/code? It would be a dream to have command like codebrew cleanup -k python python3/code (code-k/code for formula to keep).  Thanks  Here is a list of packages from codebrew cleanup -n/code  precodeWould remove: /usr/local/Cellar/aria2/1.18.9 (21 files, 4M) Would remove: /usr/local/Cellar/aria2/1.19.0 (21 files, 4M) Would

/code/pre  <answer284122> Homebrew codecleanup/code does not have a code-k/code flag, nor is there any way to get Homebrew use the codecleanup/code command to skip specific formulas.   There was a feature request in the Github Homebrew project, but it was rejected.   h1Create Your Own Tap/h1  The advice then was to create your own tap. Since you are simply creating another version, use codebrew edit [formula]/code to modify the existing formula.   See for example the codehomebrew/php/php54/code codehomebrew/php/php55/code and codehomebrew/php/php56/code formulas.   h1Create @ version formula/h1  Homebrew itself supports multiple versions of some formulas, especially for widely used programming languages.
