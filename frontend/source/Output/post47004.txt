Best way of sharing files over network with linux <body> I have an iMac running Mac OS 10.7.3 which is connected to wifi network, there is also a linux laptop connected to the same network. I want to share a folder with this laptop, I cannot use ftp since it was removed from system preferences. I don't want to share everything, so remote login is not option, unless there are settings to restrict it, so what is the best way of sharing this folder?  <answer47006> Simply use the codeFile Sharing/code option in the System Preferences.  It will give you the option to share using codeAFP/code or codeSMB/code, both of which are supported in Linux.  You didn't specify which Linux distribution you are using specifically, but most graphical distributions such as Ubuntu have codeSMB/code support out of the box (just go to Places-Network and find your share). codeAFP/code support can be obtained by installing codeafpfs-ng/code.  <answer47009> In addition to AFP, and SMB, both of which are reasonably non-unixy, you can also use NFS.  AFP also has issues in Lion with other OSs using netatalk libraries.  NFS is very well supported on Linux.  See this for a comparison: NFS, AFP, SMB... Advantages and drawbacks on a Mac OS system
