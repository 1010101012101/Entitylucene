My dad receives my sms/mms text messages instead of me <body> Around the middle of the summer, all of a sudden, any of my sms/mms text messages are received my my dad on his phone instead of my phone. I have checked, and we are not signed in to the same apple id and in my settings, the only phone number shown to receive my messages is my number. I want to stop this, any ideas?  <comment315438> Just to confirm: Settings  Messages  Send & Receive has an AppleId displayed at the top of the screen, is THAT AppleId different on both phones?  If it is not, tap the Apple ID on that screen and change.   (Fyi -there are like 7 places in settings where you can log in different appleIds) <comment315459> Also make sure that none of your email address(es) are associated with his Apple ID, even if they're not the primary Apple ID email address for his account. Same place to check as @Tyson mentioned, there will be your phone number and a list of email address(es) at which you can or are receiving messages.
