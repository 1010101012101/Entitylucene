What can change the calendar in iPhone/iOS to start weeks on Mondays and not Sundays? <body> My iPhone's calendar, configured by me to start week Sundays, suddenly started starting week Mondays. I cannot find the setting to configure this any more. I found when I switch the phone's region settings from Irish (I am in Ireland) to US, the weeks start Sunday again, but then PM times are shown as 4:06 (rather than 16:06).  What can I do to have my weeks shown properly and the time in 24 hours and remain in my local region?  <answer12019> 24-hour vs 12-hour time is set in strongSettings=General=Date &amp; Time/strong:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1VTCI.png" alt="24-hour time setting"  The Sunday vs. Monday thing may be entirely dependent upon the International setting; there's no explicit place to change it, anyway.  <comment12564> Thanks. Setting the phone to US region and making the change you describe fixed the issue. I wonder why my week was changed to start on Monday and why the configuration option for that is is the region change...
