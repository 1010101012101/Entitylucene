Mac OS X Yosemite Facebook photo posts to OSX Album only <body> The native integration of facebook and Mac OSX Yosemite. I am trying to post a photo with the native integration and the dialog already has "Timeline" Selected but yet it posts to "OS X Photos" album on FB.   How do i configure Mac OS X - to post to my FB timeline? I do not want to post it in an album.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Hftnv.png" alt="The dialog I see as below. You can see &quot;Timeline&quot; is selected but it still posts into the &quot;OS X Album&quot;"  <answer161349> Photos on Facebook are classified as a album. Every album contains a bunch of pictures. You cannot post images separately to your timeline without having it part of a album.  When you try to post on codefacebook.com/code as a timeline photo, the images are put into a album called "Timeline Images".  When you post pictures from OS X from the share tab it puts the images in the OS X Photos album. You can manually select another album to post to from the toggle beside the text codeTimeline/code.  <comment188511> Yes I know that part, I just want it to post to timeline album. Because I don't want to group the photos. Timeline Photos album pictures doesn't get grouped up (unless you post it in one post)
