How can I invert spelling proposals on iOS? <body> Is there a way to invert the behavior of the spelling proposal ?   By "invert" I mean :   ul liDon't change what I have typed if I don't do anything special /li /ul  strongAND/strong  ul liSelect the proposal if I tap on it/li /ul  <answer32804> You can disable "Auto-Correction" under codeSettings &gt; General &gt; Keyboard/code.  The check spelling will still be on and taping on the word detected as wrong will prompt you the corrections.
