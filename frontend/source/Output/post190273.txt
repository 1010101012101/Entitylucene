Outlook 2011: Re-mapping keyboard shortcuts? <body> At work I'm using Outlook 2011 and OSX 10.10. I just sent yet another incomplete email accidentally with the shortcut CMD + right enter. Is there any way to disable this shortcut? Googling around shows adding keyboard shortcuts into OSX itself but not Outlook. Thanks!  <answer190276> You can't disable it, but you can re-map the shortcut so you're far less likely to hit it.   Open System Preferences, go to Keyboard  Shortcuts (tab) App Shortcuts (Left field). Click the "+", select "Microsoft Outlook" from the "Application:" list, change "Menu Title:" to "Send," and change the shortcut to something you aren't likely to hit accidentally, such as Shift + CMD + Option + G," or similar.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ppuYA.png" alt="enter image description here"  Close and re-open Outlook. Enjoy not accidentally sending unfinished eMail!   <comment280890> I tried the solution above and it didn't disable cmd+enter it just added an additional short cut. this is awful! any help?? <comment282458> It does work, you just have to close and re-open Outlook. I'm using 14.5.8 on El Capitan (10.11.3). Thanks Rampant for the fix!
