How to find and unmount unresponsive NFS mounts? <body> I turned off a machine exporting one folder which was mounted on my Mac using NFS.  How can I find and unmount the mount point ?  codedf/code does not return; it is probably stuck on this mount point, and I can't find a way to enumerate NFS mount points.   <answer110081> This command gave me useful informations:  precode$ sudo lsof | grep -i warning  lsof: WARNING: can't stat() nfs file system /Volumes/antData Output information may be incomplete. assuming "dev=1a000005" from mount table /code/pre  This gave me the mount point on the local machine, which I used as an argument to codeumount -f/code  <answer226639> The codemount/code command on the command line should give a list of all mounts, along with the mount point and the used file system, so nfs mounts can be identified as such.  <comment275241> When  asked the question, neither df nor mount would return, but it looks like mount is less likely to hang in such case today, because I failed to reproduce the problem with a similar setup
