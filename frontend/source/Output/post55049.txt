Toggling page views in Skim <body> When right-clicking on a document in codeskim/code there are two very useful options:  ul liSingle Page (good for presentations)/li liSingle Page Continuous (suitable for reading)/li /ul  Is there a way to define a shortcut which will toggle between the two? I guess codeAppleScript/code and probably this can be helpful. Problem is I don't know how to work with AppleScript.  <answer55115> I've just assigned custom shortcuts for the menu bar items.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WPFf9.png" alt=""  You could also assign a shortcut to an AppleScript like this.  precodetry     tell application "Skim" to tell document 1         if item -2 of (view settings as list) is single page then             set view settings to {display mode:single page continuous}         else             set view settings to {display mode:single page}         end if     end tell end try /code/pre  <comment276124> Wow.  What an easy, great solution--the custom menu bar shortcut.  I didn't know about that.  I've wanted to map right-arrow and left-arrow to next page and previous page in Skim for years, and knew no way to do that.  The Skim developer was not sympathetic.   Your answer to this question, user49570, led me to the solution.  (I don't display all of the page, but don't need to move it left and right within the window.)
