iOS calendar is behaving strangly <body> I want to create a recurring event on iOS calendar but the event is not getting created properly. The event dates go beyond the specified dates.   strongThere is event start and end date./strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4Hwh6.png" width="200"   strongThis is when event should repeat it./strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aY2BY.png" width="200"   strongAnd this is what I see when I search for the result I just added/strong  As per my understanding event should have been ended on 25-July-2016, but the even is repeating itself to 2017.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UxekI.png" width="200"   <answer237840> You have thecodeEnd Date = Never/code.  The codeStarts/code and codeEnds/code are the appointment times, not the dates.  If you want it to be from 7pm to 8pm then code10-May-2016 8:00pm/code would be the codeEnds/code.  When you want to stop the repeating event, put that date in the codeEnd Date/code row.  So you would have codeEnd Date/code as code25-July-2016 8:00pm/code.
