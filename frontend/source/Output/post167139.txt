hdf5: where are you? (brew) <body> On yosemite.  I want to install octave: but hdf5 can not be found.  precode00:48:51/shared $brew tap homebrew/science Warning: Already tapped! /code/pre  So I went to try to insstall hdf5 directly:  precodewget https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-science/blob/master/hdf5.rb $ mv hdf5.rb /usr/local/Library/Formula $ 00:47:59/shared $ll /usr/local/Library/Formula/hdf5.rb -rw-r--r--     1 steve  staff   70014 Jan 13 00:46 hdf5.rb $ brew install hdf5.rb Error: No available formula for hdf5 Searching formulae... hdf5 Searching taps.. /code/pre  <answer170217> It's been moved to homebrew/science but it seems there is a a conflict with the main homebrew listing for it.  The workaround if you're just trying to install octave is to edit the octave recipe and explicitly point it at homebrew/science/hdf5 for the dependency.  In the command line type  precodebrew edit octave /code/pre  Find the line:  precode"depends_on "hdf5" =&gt; :recommended" /code/pre  and change it to:  precode"depends_on "homebrew/science/hdf5" =&gt; :recommended" /code/pre  Save your changes and brew install octave again  <comment200080> thx trying that now: in any case  i was not aware of 'brew edit' - that is already helpful so upvoting. <comment200090> it is building now - so yes your fix is working. btw "make bootstrap" takes an amazingly long time <comment200109> Yeah if I remember correctly octave requires gcc and that takes quite a long time. Hopefully any other errors will be easy to fix using the instructions brew gives you. I just fully re-installed octave from scratch with this fix and it worked ok. <comment200112> Turns out there were more steps required: I had a few outdated brew packages.
