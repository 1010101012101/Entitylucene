Is there a recipe for creating a locked-down ftp user role account? <body> I would like to set up an account on several Macs that can be used to send files to them via FTP. Specifically, I have a multifunction network printer whose scan function can FTP a scanned document to your computer, eliminating the need to directly connect to it using a USB cable.  It's pretty handy, but unfortunately the Web interface used to configure the FTP profiles (that can then be selected from the touch-screen on the printer) is woefully insecure. If you have access to it at all, you can easily dig out the userids and passwords of any FTP profiles on the device.  My thought is that creating an account on each Mac that is locked-down to the point that it can only drop files into a single directory using FTP is one possible solution. If the credentials of that account are stolen, they don't really do much for the bad guy.  So, is there a recipe for creating a locked-down ftp user role account?
