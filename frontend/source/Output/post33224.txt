How to disconnect from specific WiFi network (while remembering the connection) <body> I would like to disconnect from my WiFi network on OS X Lion without having the computer to forget the network. So basically I'm looking for a way to just disconnect and connect to a specific WiFi network at will.  How do I do this?   <answer33402> Would setting up different locations under Network preferences, each having different way out settings be an option? You'd 'sort of' be disconnecting.  <answer38006> You can disconnect from the current wireless network without turning wireless off by running the following command on the command line:  precodesudo /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport -z /code/pre  <answer144409> Your router may also offer a user interface which offers a way to disconnect from the wifi network.  I just tested it out with mine and it worked fine.  I also tested the command line prompt described above, and that worked, too.  <answer157578> I know that it's old question but maybe someone is looking for better solution.  I've just found that you can detach from a WiFi network by kbdOpt/Alt/kbd-clicking on the Wifi icon and then selecting the appropriate option in the dropdown.  <comment166228> Thanks very much --- but is there _seriously_ no way to do this from the GUI? <comment265800> That Alt key hides all kinds of suprises in OSX
