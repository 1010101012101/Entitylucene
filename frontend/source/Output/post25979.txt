Is there a built-in text-to-graphic utility for OS X Lion? <body> I believe I've seen one or more utilities, possibly command-line or Applescript, which will take a string and create, for example, an image containing that text with the specified font size, etc.  I can't find it again. Does anyone have a hint?  <answer25988> ImageMagick doesn't come with OS X, but it should though.  codeconvert -background skyblue -border 10 -bordercolor skyblue -fill 'hsb(10%,50%,50%)' -font /Library/Fonts/Arial\ Narrow.ttf -pointsize 24 label:"some text" output.png/code  If you have to specify some more complex styles, using webkit2png might be easier.  precodeecho "&lt;style&gt;em {padding:5px}&lt;/style&gt;&lt;em&gt;Test&lt;/em&gt;" &gt; test.html webkit2png test.html --clipwidth=55 --clipheight=35 --scale 1 -C /code/pre  <answer26226> Image Magick will do what you want, I believe. It's not built-in.  <comment29633> You should save temporary files to `/tmp` rather than the desktop, just in case rm fails for some reason and the user sees a new file on their desktop. <comment29715> Thanks.  This product seems to create a screen shot of a webpage, if I understand correctly, a bit of a long way around.  I really think there's a simple utility that does  text-to-jpg (say) directly. <comment29863> Right, agreed, but in this case I'm looking for just the bare bones, being able to specify the font name and size, period.
