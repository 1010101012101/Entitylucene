How to sniff/capture/trace USB data in recent macOS? <body> The old 'USB Prober.app' does not work after Mavericks. Is there way to capture USB data in Sierra?  To be specific, I got a LG UltraFine 4K monitor, whose brightness can only be controlled from macOS via USB protocol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ePS5y.png" alt="USB brightness control LG UF 4K"  I would like to figure out the traffic data and write a utility for controlling brightness in other OSes.  The connection is a special DP over USB-C so I cannot use a hardward USB tracer.  <comment333828> Still have not got how do sniff USB in macOS.For my objective, I sniff the traffic when adjusting brightness using latest Boot Camp Support Software in Windows. Here is a standalone utility for adjusting brightness for this display without Boot Camp: https://github.com/unknownzerx/lguf-brightness/releases .
