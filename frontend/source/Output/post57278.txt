Changing the name attached to my MacBook Pro <body> I bought a MacBook Pro Retina, and it's my first OS X computer. During setup, I had a brain lapse and entered my mom's email address instead of my own. I don't remember what it was I was setting up, but I believe it had something to do with Apple ID. My mom has a MacBook herself.  I'm not talking about the computer name. The computer is named correctly. Also, iTunes and the App Store are linked to my own Apple ID.  Later, when I opened up Xcode, I found that new Objective-C files have my mom's name in the comments section at the top.  I just installed Parallels and also found that during registration my mom's name and email address appear pre-filled for me.  I have no idea what to do to change this. Any idea how I can retake "ownership"?  <answer57284> You need to change your personal contact card in Address Book, soon to be Contacts in Mountain Lion.  In order to do this, launch Address Book and create a card with your information in it.  Then, while your card is selected, go to the Card menu and select "Make This My Card".  strongNote:/strong  I'm not sure if Xcode has a stores this info elsewhere or not, but anything new that you install will definitely get this updated info.  <comment65773> So the computer name shows up correctly in the Sharing pane of System Preferences? <comment65776> @daviesgeek, yes, it does! <comment65778> Great, thank you. I think that was it. When I opened Address Book I saw my mom's email in there with a silhouette icon next to it, denoting that it's default. I'm pretty sure this should fix it. <comment65780> Well, it seems like you fixed the issue! I didn't even know that...
