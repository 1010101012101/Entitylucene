How to show hidden files on mac without Terminal <body> I need an easy way to switch files visibility on Mac. I know about Terminal commands how to show hidden files and hide files. However, I need a tool to make this task faster and easier.  I was trying to find a special app in the App Store, but found nothing. Is there any way to show/hide hidden files without launching Terminal? Any tips or apps?    <answer258737> You can easily create your own app for this using  Platypus. Just replace emevince/em with the commands for hiding/showing hidden files. The appropriate commands can be found here.  <answer258738> You can try the stronglong way/strong to show hidden Mac OS X files is as follows:  ol liOpen Terminal found in Finder  Applications  Utilities/li liIn Terminal, paste the following: emdefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES/em/li liPress return/li liHold the ‘Option/alt’ key, then right click on the Finder icon in the dock and click Relaunch./li /ol  This will show all hidden files. To hide them again, follow the same steps but replace the Terminal command with:  emdefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles NO/em  It’s not the longest set of instructions or the biggest command to commit to memory but if you’re doing this a lot, it’s worth spending a few minutes now to save yourself a lot more time in the future.  <answer258741> emI just realised I've already posted this before - with instructions on how to persuade the use of kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd H /kbd, which otherwise is used for 'Hide frontmost app'/em https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/177138/85275br emThis version has a fuller explanation of precisely how to create the service, so I'll leave it in, with the link./em  You could write an Applescript, place it in an Automator Service, then trigger it by Key Command...  The following will toggle the hidden state with each trigger of the hot key  ul liLaunch Automator [Applications/Utilities]/li liSelect New Service/li liIn the Actions list on the left, Select Automator, then Run Applescript from the 2nd column./li liCopy/Paste the script [full text at the end of this answer]br emMake sure you don't get the on run/end run section twice when pasting./em/li liSave [It will automatically save to the correct place for Services./li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ariXR.png" alt="enter image description here"  ul liOpen System Preferences  Keyboard  Shortcuts  Services.

Prior OSes, you could refresh the views.  <answer258743> I like Tetsujin's approach. In fact, it's a shame most Mac users never familiarise themselves with AppleScript and Automator.  However, if you're after an off-the-shelf solution you can opt for Onyx. Onyx is a powerful tool that can perform a lot of functions. It is free to use and no registration is necessary.  In particular reference to your question, to hide/unhide hidden files and folders, go to the Parameters page, select the Finder tab and check/uncheck the relevant option. See screenshot below:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/adQZj.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongNOTE:/strong  I have no affiliation with the Onyx product.  <answer258914> "stronginvisible"/strong is a free app in appstore that I am using to see the hidden files on my mac. It works actually great for me. Why not give it a try?  <answer264473> On strongMacOS Sierra/strong you can use codeshift ⇧/code + codecmd ⌘/code + code./code shortcut on keyboard to toggle between strong2/strong states. No need for any plugin/app. It works out of the box.

". Have you read the question? <comment323525> OP explicitly said "without launching Terminal"
