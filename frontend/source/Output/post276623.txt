Why is [dos] sometimes in the output of a save in "vim". such as: "foo.txt [dos] 38L, 193C"? <body> In certain text files, after doing a save in codevim/code with code:w/code, the output mentions code[dos]/code as such:br code"foo.txt" [dos] 38L, 193C/code  Why is code[dos]/code displayed?  As a simple test, I've created a new file with codevim/code on a codeFAT32/code disk attached to my Mac. Those files don't display code[dos]/code after a save in codevim/code. I copied that file to code/tmp/code (native MacOS format). Opening it there does not display code[dos]/code upon a save in codevim/code either.    So, codefoo.txt/code has Japanese characters. A portion looks like:       臣br   区br   ...br   草br   早br   古br   谷br   "foo.txt" [dos] 38L, 193C   some testing:       /tmp$ file -I foo.txtbr   foo.txt: text/plain; charset=strongutf-8/strong   codefoo.txt/code life cycle:    ol liOn emXP/em I created lots of text files using emTextEdit/em that had Japanese characters and saved to emFAT32/em file system (usb drive)./li liThey were archived into a codeZIP/code format./li liThat usb drive was attached and copied to my MacBook (emMacOS Extended / Journaled/em)./li licode/usr/bin/unzip/code unarchived them, and here I am./li /ol  Text files are such a basic cross-platform file format. Obviously, "something" is different with those code[dos]/code marked files... What flags a file as being a code[dos]/code file?  <answer276625>    What flags a file as being a [dos] file?   Line endings. Windows uses CR (carrage return) and NL (newline) characters. Old Mac plain text files use CR and macOS command line editors use NL.  <comment348191> facepalm. ah yes, the good old "CR" / "NL" scourge. ":set ff=unix" and ":set ff=dos" lets for toggling. thanks!
