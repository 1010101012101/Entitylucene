Find stolen iPhone 4 <body> I called Apple to see if they could ping my stolen iPhone 4. They said that they cant because the "find my iphone" isnt on. The phone isnt activated but the person who stole it has been using â€¦ it to get into my emails, Facebook and other apps linked to my Apple ID, because as most know as long as there is wifi iPhones can used to do everytjing except make calls and text. Is there a way to find the location of the phone using the IMEI and the last time it was on wifi?   <comment320101> Not if fnd my iPhone is turned off.   You turn it off, but still expect it to work? <comment320104> 1) Change all of your passwords. This will lock the other person out of your accounts. 2) Contact your cellular provider to see if they can trace it. <comment320106> Possible duplicate: http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/142983/88313 <comment320110> Tyson - my husband took this phone and has been trying to use it against me by sending emails to himself and trying to use them in court during our final PFA hearing. Your smart a** comment is not appreciated. I didn't even know about find your iphone when i purchased the phone 3 years ago, so it was never on from the beginning. If you cant answer my question then don't reply because you didn't answer my question. <comment320111> Sorry you think that's a smart ass comment but it's not, it directly answers the question you asked.  What you really should be asking tho is how to lock your ex-husband out of your various accounts that are being accessed thru a stolen iPhone. <comment320199> @krisseyg I'd talk to you lawyer ASAP. Theoretically 1) he stole your phone, which is illegal. 2) anything he takes from that phone would be inadmissible in court being as he illegally obtained that information from your private device. If I were you, I'd change all my passwords to lock him out, then see if you can use the law to your advantage to 1) make everything he obtains inadmissible and 2) if you want, press or threaten to press any legal charges (even something as small as theft) you can.
