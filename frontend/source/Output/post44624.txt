How can I add a second sender address with different SMTP server in iOS? <body> I forward my university email address to my GMail account, so I don’t have my university IMAP set up as an account on my iPad (and I don’t want to, because then I’d receive those mails twice). Still, I want to send email using that address, via my university’s SMTP server.  ul liIs there any way to add another sender address to an account and assign it a different SMTP server than the account’s default SMTP in the iPad’s email client?/li liIf not, can you recommend another email client for the iPad that has this capability?/li /ul  <answer44626> h1Configuring additional outgoing mail servers/h1  from the strongApple support/strong websites has detail instructions:  ol liGo to strongSettings &#x2192; Mail, Contacts, Calendars./strong/li liTap the strongMail account/strong for which you would like to change the settings.

It sounds more like “if the default SMTP is down/unreachable, it will try to use the other one instead”. What I want is to always use it for mails I send from one specific address (and always use the default server for the primary address). <comment50750> Whenever you compose a new mail, you may choose from which server/address to send it from by tapping on "From:". <comment50753> That popup menu only shows addresses for me, not servers. <comment50754> @Lukas Each email address is bound to a server in the Mail app. <comment50765> And how does that binding work? I can add new email addresses (by entering them comma-separated into the account’s Email field) and new SMTP servers (via the method you described) independently from each other. Also, if I send an email from my university address with the university’s SMTP server set up via that method, it still uses GMail’s SMTP server (according to the mail headers). <comment50767> @Lukas If you send mail from a different SMTP server, the receiver of your mail can only see the email address related to this email service. If you just change the name of the address (comma solution), the mail is not sent via a different server. Several mail clients (e.g. Outlook) will be able to see both your email addresses: The one related to the SMTP server and the alias. Apple's mail client only shows the alias - i think. In general it's better to send emails using different servers, not just alias. <comment50787> Yes, and I want to send email using a different server – I just don’t see any way to do that without setting up a completely separate email account (the method you linked to above only adds a new SMTP as a backup for the default one and doesn’t allow to specify an email address for use with that server). GMail’s web interface and Sparrow, for example, allow this (using their Send Email As/Alias features and then setting a custom SMTP for an address), but I guess Apple’s client doesn’t.  Anyway, thanks for trying to help, appreciate it. :)
