Unfortunate deleting binary command file <body> I deleted "codechmod/code" by mistake using "codesudo rm chmod/code". What is the way to recover the codechmod/code command? Is it 'a no way to do it' operation? I'm using Mac OS X Yosemite.  <answer196230> This question probably has all the answers for you. In short there is no easy way. Your options are:   ol liRecover the files from a (Time machin) Backup, if existent./li liReinstall OSX, e.g. from the Recovery mode pressing  kbdCommand/kbd+kbdR/kbd at the startup screen/li liCopy the missing files from the Recovery partition (check if the partition is up to date first). E.g. by doing codecp -a /bin /Volumes/&lt;your disk name&gt;/code/li /ol  <comment234380> There's a recovery partition; you may be able to use that.  However, I think the question is more appropriate for [Ask Different](http://apple.stackoverflow.com/) â€” or possibly [Super User](http://superuser.com/).  Also, if you have Time Machine backups running, you should be able to use that to recover a copy of the file, and then carefully use `sudo` to copy it back to `/bin/chmod`.  And, in future, make sure you are paying attention when you're working as root.  Removing a single binary is fairly innocuous compared with the damage you could have done. <comment234381> Thanks to reply. However I didn't have any backups, so i need another way.
