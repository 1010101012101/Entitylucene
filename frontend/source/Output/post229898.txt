Firefox won't respond to force-quit <body> On http://repl.it, I accidentally created an infinite loop in Python 3. I tried to close the tab, but Firefox already stopped responding. It wouldn't respond even after a while, so I force quitted FF. Then, I tried to reopen it, and it bounced for a while. It wouldn't reopen, so I force quitted and reopened again. Now, it is just sitting on my Dock with the little black "open" dot below it. Clicking on the icon does nothing.    How can I fix this? (I hate Safari) I don't mind using Bash/Terminal, if it makes a difference. Also, it would be nice if it didn't reboot all my other apps as well, but if worst comes to worst, this is okay. Thanks!  <answer229901> A few things you can try (ordered by "assertiveness"):  ul liStart with kbdCommand/kbd-kbdOption/kbd-kbdEscape/kbd to bring up the Force Quit dialog and see if it's there. If it is, force quit it (sounds like you've already tried this)./li liOpen Terminal, and run codeps -eaf | grep Firefox/code. If Firefox appears in the list (note that there will always be an entry for codegrep Firefox/code, this is not what you want, the actual Firefox will be listed as something like code/Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox/code), note the PID (the second column, a number), and run codekill -9 &lt;PID&gt;/code./li /ul  If neither of these work, try restarting the Dock (maybe Firefox actually isn't running but the Dock is confused):  ul liUse the same codeps -eaf | grep Dock/code./li liThere should be a process called code/System/Library/CoreServices/Dock.app/Contents/MacOS/Dock/code, note the PID and run codekill &lt;PID&gt;/code./li liThe Dock should disappear momentarily and then restart./li /ul  If all this fails, easiest thing to do is probably just reboot your machine. If the usual shutdown dialog fails, press and hold the power button until the computer powers down.  <answer253848> Ok so I had this, if you hit command option and escape, you can cut all power to it!!! This is the best way for me atleast, thanks thiugh  <comment280515> With the second test, I got:                                                                          501 56821 56296   0  2:42PM ttys000    0:00.00 grep Firefox Are any of these right? <comment280516> If that's all you got, that means that Firefox isn't running. Try restarting the Dock. <comment280517> `ps -eaf | grep Dock`:                                                                                         501   248     1   0 31Jan16 ??         2:26.03 /System/Library/CoreServices/Dock.app/Contents/MacOS/Dock   501   300     1   0 31Jan16 ??         0:07.82 /System/Library/CoreServices/Dock.app/Contents/XPCServices/com.apple.dock.extra.xpc/Contents/MacOS/com.apple.dock.extra   501   456   248   0 31Jan16 ??         1:23.62 /System/Library/CoreServices/Dock.app/Contents/Resources/DashboardClient.app/Contents/MacOS/DashboardClient   501 56944 56296   0  2:58PM ttys000    0:00.00 grep Dock <comment280518> What is the process id? <comment280519> It's the first line (note the path), so the PID is 248. <comment280520> It's still not working, I'm going to reboot. <comment280521> It won't reboot, saying FF won't quit. BTW, the force-quit dialogue recognized FF as open, but clicking Force Quit wouldn't do anything. <comment280522> Press and hold the power button to power the computer off. <comment280535> http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/22180/how-can-i-kill-a-non-responding-app
