Verizon iPhone 5/5s: using as hotspot (specifically using ssh) during incoming call <body> What will a CDMA (specifically, a Verizon) iPhone 5s do when being used by a MBP to connect to the Internet, and more specifically, to another server through SSH, when an incoming call comes in? Will the connection be dropped? I'm an iPhone 4s user, looking to switch from AT&amp;T to a more reliable network. As a web developer, I do work via SSH-ing into different servers to edit files, restart web servers/processes, etc. I don't need to answer any incoming call while connected... but was worried that each and every call would bump me from my connections, regardless of whether I answered. Anyone have any knowledge/experience here?
