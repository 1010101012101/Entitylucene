How to block internet access of all apps (except browser) when using 3g usb modem? <body> Is there any app that helps me to block all apps for accessing the internet when using 3g modem?   <answer130301> Yes, (assuming you are using Mac OS X), but you're not going to like the answer: pfctl. (Prior to OS X 10.7 Lion, the firewall was ipfw.)  Also, alternatively, you can use the GUI to configure pfctl (or ipfw).  hr  Also, OS X includes an application firewall :     h2Allowing specific applications/h2      h3To allow a specific app to receive incoming connections, add it using Firewall Options:/h3      ul   liOpen System Preferences./li   liClick the Security or Security &amp; Privacy icon./li   liSelect the Firewall tab./li   liClick the lock icon in the preference pane, then enter an administrator name and password./li   liClick the Firewall Options button/li   liClick the Add Application (+) button./li   liSelect the app you want to allow incoming connection privileges for./li   liClick Add./li   liClick OK./li   liYou can also remove any apps listed here that you no longer want to allow by clicking the Remove App (-) button.Â /li   /ul   hr  There is also a third party application that is very popular called Little Snitch that will do what you ask.  hr  Although I wouldn't recommend it for your purposes unless you were using it to learn about it for its own sake, OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard and above includes a sandbox facility (be sure to read the man pages listed under "SEE ALSO.")  <answer130308> Little Snitch is like a Ferrari if you can afford it.  There is a now discontinued little app that does the same for 10.6 and before Yosemite.  TCPBlock:  Allows you to select who is to be blocked and who not.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IvOGr.png" alt="TCPblock"  <comment152710> Do you mind clicking a few buttons yourself to switch profiles/etc or do you want it to block internet access *automatically* when you connect your modem?
