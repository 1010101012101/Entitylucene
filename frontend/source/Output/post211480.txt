Can I add guide lines or background elements to my Pages document to assist with layout? <body> I'm currently using Pages '09 on OS X 10.10.5. I have a document in portrait orientation that I occasionally print (8.5" x 11"), and fold into four equal vertical sections, like a spreadsheet with one column and four rows. Here's an image matching what I do with the printout.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CYECW.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  The document consists of several text boxes. The text box layout is fitted to the content and this does not correspond to the page folding. Is there some way to add guide lines to my document to see where the folds will be? This would be for layout purposes only, the lines shouldn't appear in the printout. I looked through the menu options and the document inspector, but didn't see a way to accomplish what I want.  I believe any of these options would work, but I'm not sure how to accomplish them:  ul liAdd guide lines manually/li liDisplay a vertical ruler for the page (menu item references rulers but this document only displays a horizontal ruler)/li liCreate a background image with the guide lines (easy with Pixelmator) and add it to the document/li /ul  I am willing to use a newer version of Pages.  <answer212142> Here is how I solved this:  ul liUsed a spreadsheet to choose values for all of the margins and four equal-height text boxes to best use the full 11" height of the printed page/li liCreated four text boxes, full page width, and equal height/li liUsed margins at the top of page, bottom of page, and between each text box, with all of these margins being of equal value/li liUsed the spreadsheet to determine the exact starting Y location of each text box and enforce the desired margins/li liPasted existing text into the four text boxes, using paragraph separation in some cases to combine the text from previously-separate textboxes into one textbox/li /ul  <comment255289> Could you add a pic of what it actually looks like when it's finished? Use lorem ipsum or blur it if necessary. I had [this idea](http://i.stack.imgur.com/SEi9F.png) using columns, but I'm not sure it fits your brief. <comment255415> @Tetsujin I could, but I don't believe that would add any detail to the problem I'm trying to solve. Your example is interesting; perhaps the text in those columns could be rotated 90 degrees. But I'm working with seven text boxes of varying heights, and just want to lay them out manually within the four resulting rows according to the fold lines. <comment255416> @Tetsujin I could attempt a nested-textbox approach where I start with the four columns as you show, and move my existing text boxes into the four columns. (Assuming I can rotate the text to preserve the portrait layout.) But it's possible that no combination will fit. <comment255419> A problem with the columns approach is that when a textbox is focused, the columns guide in the horizontal ruler is not shown. <comment255443> That's why a picture of the layout would have been handy - no-one could possibly guess from your existing pic that you wanted it portrait. <comment256142> You're right; the image I supplied did not match the orientation of the document I'm editing. Fixed.
