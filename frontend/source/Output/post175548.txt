Does Time Machine improve startup time? <body> This may initially sound like a question, and I'm by no means a amateur user of the OSX Operating system(s).   However, upon recently upgrading to Yosemite, my system has become SUPER slow to boot, and I'm wondering if Time Machine will at all aid the start up time by distributing the burden to two disks?   Thanks in advance.

The presence of a timecapsule is found by osx, only after the bonjour service detects the Timecapsule. Bonjour service kicks in only after a user logs in.   The slowness may be caused by the sheer amount of data that needs to be transfered to memory (Which more or less increases with every update). I suggest you to add a SSD and install the os in that. You can still use your existing 1TB ADD as a secondary storage to keep your files.  <comment207051> If anything, Time Machine would contribute to slow start up. Not Time Machine itself, but the external disk (which is mounted during the boot process). This is highly unlikely culprit however. Slow startups can be caused by many things - from 3rd party kernel extensions to a failing internal drive.
