Are "Extensions" something that disappeared many Mac OS versions ago? <body> On a sheet of Mac keyboard shortcuts for booting, one of them says, "hold down shift while booting and the computer will not load login items or extensions".  Am I wrong, or are Mac OS "extensions" something that were phased out a long time ago?  (In other words, with OS X Lion, the shift key simply cancels loading the login items, period?)  Note that, of course, I know that "extensions" has meaning in other apps -- Firefox, Safari, Thunderbird, etc.  But please confirm my Mac OS X suspicion as I describe it above.    (Yep, I know this is related to my other question.  Getting this answer clear will allow me to resolve both questions clearly and designate their correct answers.)  <answer53292> Your expectation that extensions are only a thing of the past is incorrect.  Modern Mac OS X uses kernel extensions, which are not identical to the "old school" extensions used in Mac OS 9 and earlier, but yes, there are still such a thing as extensions. You can find them in code/System/Library/Extensions/code.  Apple expands on this in this support document about Safe Mode.  <answer53321> To go along with @Daniel's answer: holding down the shift key on startup of OS X should prevent "startup items" from opening.  <comment60932> To expand on the difference between Classic and OS X extensions: most, if not all, of the hardware drivers required by Classic Macs were included in the system software itself, *not* as separate extensions. In OS X most hardware drivers *are* provided as extensions. <comment60968> You've said the same thing Daniel did. How is yours an "opposite answer"? <comment60980> Woah!  I thought "kernel extensions" and "startup items" were different things! <comment60982> I should say: your answers are *complimentary*, not identical. He explained extensions then vs. now, while you specified what the keyboard shortcut does. I've edited your answer to make that more apparent. <comment61538> I read the document Daniel posted and it answered all the remaining questions I have! Sorry.  the above apple documnet at the bottom of daniel's answer is great. THANKS -- all done. <comment61539> @estephan500 That's a great question, and it deserves to be asked as its own question, rather than trying to get an answer here in the comments thread. <comment61540> thanks daniel -- in fact I deleted the question you are referring to in the thread -- got my answer in the document. thx!
