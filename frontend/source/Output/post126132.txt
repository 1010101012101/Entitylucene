Samba installed on Mac OS X Mav, how can I test it using smbclient? <body> I can't tell if Samba (open Source) installed on Mac OS X mav is running &amp; working  I try to access the smb share from a windows machine using \10.0.0.10\var\www (the share name in smb.conf), but I get a can't connect error (no prompt for auth pwd.  I tried from the mac, in terminal using smbclient -L localhost it prompts me for root pwd, but then says NT_STATUS_UNSUCCESSFUL (google searches show this is generic something is wrong). i did create a root user with pwd using smbpasswd -a  Samba is not writing a log file to /usr/local/Cellar/samba/3.6.23/var/ so that's not very helpful  ps aux | grep smbd shows   root  1260   1.2  0.0  2433808    640 s000  S+   12:34AM   0:00.00 grep smbd   therefore i think samba is running :(  we had the built in smb working, but when a windows user on the lan created files in the share, it wasn't setting the proper permissions, and several blogs said apple's built in smb is borked. so we installed samba using home brew.  hope this is helpful enough for you to suggest some ideas... i'm out of them tonight.
