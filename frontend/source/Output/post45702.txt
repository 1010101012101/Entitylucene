How to change network connection order? <body> I have multiple network access in the same area.

Alternatively, you could click the WiFi icon in the menu bar, then choose Open Network Preferences.  In the preference pane, you can make your Mac prefer Ethernet connections over WiFi, for example, or the other way around.  img src="https://i.imgur.com/HoNSV.png" alt=""  If you click the “settings” symbol next to the code+/code and code-/code buttons, you’ll be able to select “Set Service Order”:  img src="https://i.imgur.com/2NoXM.png" alt=""  If you continue to WiFi → Advanced you can set the order of WiFi networks specifically by dragging them around:  img src="https://i.imgur.com/t2FVx.png" alt=""  <answer45706> Go to System PreferencesNetworkAdvancedWi-Fi:    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/51119.png" alt="Network"br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/r3xjO.png" alt="Advanced"br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6WdfA.png" alt="drag wifi into the order you prefer"    As you can see, you can drag the networks into the order you prefer.  <answer45708> Open System Preferences, and select the codeNetwork/code preference pane.
