How do I get my Mac to do nothing when I insert a cd? <body> I recently got an older MacBook Pro that has an optical drive. Every time I insert a CD, iTunes will always respond in some way.   I have already tried changing the setting in strongiTunes  Preferences  General/strong, but I don't see the option I want.   How do I get this Mac to absolutely do nothing when I insert a CD?   <answer288170> You can do this in your Mac's system preferences:  ol liGo to strongApple  System Preferences  CDs &amp; DVDs/strong/li liYou'll see a menu for emWhen you insert a music CD/em/li liChange that menu from "Open iTunes" to "Ignore"./li /ol  strongNotes:/strong   ul liYou may also want to check the options for Blank CD and Blank DVD as they also include built-in options to open iTunes. /li liThe other menus also provide the ability to run a script, so if you got the MacBook from someone and you're using their old account, these may be worth checking as well in case they're launching iTunes or another application./li /ul  <comment363850> @Monomeeth Thanks!
