Typing >console in username box—nothing shows up until cancelled <body> When I type code&gt;console/code into the username box on the login screen, the computer seems to freeze for a very long time. Then I press code^C^C^C^C^D^C^D^D^D^C^D/code and eventually the computer unfreezes—but first, it flashes the session contents (showing the login console prompt, in what appears to be the same font as single user mode).  This is a fresh (or close enough) Mavericks install with  ul lino third-party kernel extensions/li lino extra apps but the Yosemite installer (It is the same on Yosemite but I'm not allowed to ask about that :P)/li /ul  on a Macbook Air, 2012, 10.9.3.  It appears that I'm having a problem very similar to the one in this question … but the console actually shows up for me, as soon as I exit.  Also, I am using the user list then selecting a name and pressing kbdoption ⌥/kbd+kbdreturn ↩/kbd but that doesn't seem to matter.  hr  I was able to take a photo of what is going on:  precodeDarwin/BSD (Hostname.local) (console)  login: █username&gt; Password:**** [IOBluetoothHostControllerUSBTransport][SuspendDevice] -- Suspend -- suspendDeviceCallResult = 0x0000 (kIOReturnSuccess) -- 0xf400 ****  Password: Password: Login incorrect login: █D ––that is a control-d /code/pre  The block characters are cursors.  A session that I could actually log in to (but still not see my typing):  precodeDarwin/BSD (Hostname.local) (console)  login: &lt;username&gt; Password: Last login: Tue Jun 24 08:06:36 on console $ echo hello hello $ $ $ **** [IOBluetoothHostControllerUSBTransport][SuspendDevice] -- Suspend -- suspendDeviceCallResult = 0x0000 (kIOReturnSuccess) -- 0xf400 ****  $ $ logout █ /code/pre  <comment161220> Alright, I tried it again and this time it showed up with the login prompt but nothing echoed until logout. <comment161634> Is this a question? It looks more like a report of strange behaviour <comment162612> Are you using an external display? <comment162615> @Matt: Yes. I should have mentioned that (but I haven't tested it with only one yet). <comment162616> @0942v8653: If you can, test it without the ED. I've noticed that sometimes console mode and SU mode don't play nicely with ED's.
