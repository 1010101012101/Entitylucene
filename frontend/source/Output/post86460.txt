Which version of OS X should install on a 2006 MacBook? <body> I have an old MacBook that I bought in 2006. I formatted and restored the original system. Everything was bad: I downloaded Skype, Chrome, and others, and every program said:      This software does not work anymore with this version of the operating system   (or similar)  So I installed a version of Mac OS X 10.6 (the one I got with my old iMac) and now it seems to work fine. Sometimes a few programs crash, and so I thought installing 10.6 wasn't the right way to go either.  What is the best way to handle an old MacBook with current versions of programs like Skype, Chrome, et cetera?  <answer86461> Depending on what MacBook version you have, you may be able to install different OSes.  However, what I do recommend is the best, and most stable OS that Apple has yet to ship: Snow Leopard, which is 10.6.X as you say.   emstrongYou should do a fresh install – not from a iMac CD, but from an retail Snow Leopard disc!/em/strong  All apps but few still support Snow Leopard.
