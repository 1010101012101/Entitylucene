MacBook weird behaviour - virus? <body> I'd be glad if somebody could help me with these problems. For a couple of days I am experiencing weird behaviour with my MacBook Pro. OS is El Capitan 10.11.6. Could I maybe have a virus?  Problems:  ul liScrolling down does sometimes not work. It shows an animation but goes back to the top of the screen. This happens with browsers as well as with others apps (e.g. OpenOffice; including this text box, I can't read anymore what I wrote below this line....)/li liSometimes my external trackball suddenly does not work with one USB slot anymore but still with the other; later that USB slot doesn't work anymore and I have to change again, it works again/li liA few times left and right click did not do anything; it did not work no matter whether I used the track pad or my external track ball/li liWhen pressing Cmd + Tab it doesn't stop running through the list of open apps./li liSometimes all of a sudden the problems disappear. And then suddenly my MacBook crashes when I click on a link/li liThe menu at the bottom has also disappeared and rarely re-appears/li linow every time I log in I see a loading bar on the log in screen, which I did not see earlier or only after software updates/li /ul  Had to continue writing on my other laptop. :(  <comment367932> Iâ€™d try two things: first, download and run a free antivirus software (Avira and Avast are borne good choices). If the virus scan comes back with a virus, remove it/them. If it comes back clean, run Apple Hardware Test. Post the results as edits to your question. <comment367953> Have you tried re-setting the NVRAM (used to be called PRAM) ? When starting the machine, hold down 4 keys at the same time : cmd-alt-p-r BEFORE you hear the chime. While holding down the 4 keys wait to hear 3 sets of the chimes then release and allow the mac to boot normally. It can be worth doing this twice but once is usually sufficient. It is worth doing this once a month anyway - some reckon once a week! <comment367999> I tried re-setted NVRAM several times and it seems to have helped with the scrolling problems including scrolling through apps with Cmd+Tab. My MacBook still crashes (e.g. when I tried to install Avira). I did the 4 keys again and this time it offered me not to open the apps I had opened before it crashed. Avira is running now. <comment368040> @SolarMike - please don't recommend resetting the NVRAM "for fun". If ever it needs doing, it needs to be done immediately **after** the chimes, once [ie, wait for the second chime before releasing]... & then only if an actual NVRAM issue is suspected. It is not & has never been a cure-all or any kind of preventive medicine. It probably won't hurt anything, but it really won't fix much at all. If you ever do truly suspect NVRAM, then SMC reset would also be wise [though again, not just for fun]
