How do I set the static library path in OS X Lion? <body> Instead of typing :  precodeg++ functions.cpp  /opt/local/lib/libhdf5.a /opt/local/lib/libsiloh5.a  /opt/local/lib/libz.a /code/pre  I would prefer to type:  precodeg++ functions.cpp  -lhdf5 -lsiloh5 -lz /code/pre  I think that I need to add /opt/local/lib (Macports lib install location) to my library path. I have tried:  precodeexport LIBRARY_PATH="/opt/local/lib" export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/opt/local/lib" export LD_LIBRARY_PATHS="/opt/local/lib" /code/pre  None work  <answer98373> On OS X the environment variable:  precode$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH /code/pre  Is the one that you want.  precodeexport DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH="/opt/local/lib" /code/pre  does the trick, allowing you to conveniently link to macports static libraries.  Remember to restart your shell.  <answer192445> The normal command line is to use the -L option to add the path to the library search  precodeg++ functions.cpp -L/opt/local/lib -lhdf5 -lsiloh5 -lz /code/pre  <answer287786> I think this will do  precodeexport LDFLAGS='-L/opt/local/lib' /code/pre  <comment228883> DYLD is for dynamic libraries when the app runs ie .dylib (or .so) and not static linking which is at link time <comment353760> +1. Here's some additional information. There are built-in directories that g++ will search for libraries. Run `g++ --print-search-dirs` to see these. Unless you got g++ from macports (highly unlikely), it won't search /opt/local/lib by default.
