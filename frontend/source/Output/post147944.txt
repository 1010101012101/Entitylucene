iOS8 calendar events in Notifications <body> I use Calendar on my iPhone, for school timetable. So the lessons are displayed in the Notifications. But I have discovered, that after updating my phone to iOS8, there is a weird bug. On tuesdays, I see the monday lessons, (after reseting the phone, it gets back to normal - shows the correct day). Every other day this works without a problem...  Does anyone else have the same problem and any ideas how to fix this?  <comment174408> what is your setting for "work" days/hours in calender? <comment174537> Where do I find this settings?
