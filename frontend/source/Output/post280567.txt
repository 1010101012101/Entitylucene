Previews and Masters in Photos Library <body> After recently recovering my Photos library on MacOS I found another backup that contained the same master files but different preview files. Everything in the other backups's codeMasters/code folder were duplicates of my recovered files, but the previews were different, including in some cases emlarger/em versions of the masters.  My question is this. Is codePreviews/code generated from codeMasters/code in some manner that would allow me to ignore it if I believe I have all of the master files?  More broadly, what directories contain files that are absolutely necessary to make sure I don't lose any original photos? I don't care if I lose album data, face info or modifications to files.  OS: 10.12.4, Photos: 2.0
