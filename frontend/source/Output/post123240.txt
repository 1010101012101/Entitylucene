Fix iOS 7(.1) Chrome SSL error <body> h1 strongQuick Word/strong/h1  I know I'm  not supposed to talk about the iOS betas here, however, my question is not related to the beta itself, it's just what I use currently, and could (possibly) happen to anyone on &lt; iOS 7.0.4.  h1 strongThe Problem/strong/h1  I use chrome as my main browser on iOS &amp; on my Mac, however a few days ago, I saw this error in chrome for iOS when I entered youtube.com and google.com:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/g8hR2.png" alt="Chrome can&#39;t open youtube.com"  And I got this on the homescreen:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Np6wO.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongWhat I've tried/strong  I do use the iOS 7.1 beta 5 on my iPhone 5, since I'm an app developer, and I've heard about the SSL bug that affected iOS 7.0.4, and after doing some research, apple hasn't patched the beta. So, is there any way I can fix this without restoring my phone? I've tried:  ul liReseting network settings/li liConnecting to a VPN using Hotspot VPN and Spotflux/li liSwitching between WiFi and 3G (my stupid carrier has still no 4G..)/li /ul  I would appreciate any help I get!  <comment143902> I'm running on the same version and I can't replicate the error. Chrome and Safari work perfectly. If you have anything you wish to ask or have me try, let me know. <comment143903> @Bootle I don't know how to replicate the error, since it came unexpectedly, without me changing any settings first!
