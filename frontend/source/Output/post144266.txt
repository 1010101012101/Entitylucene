Macbook Pro file mods <body> When I run codels -l/code there are files listed with code@/code file mod for some folders:  precodedrwxr-xr-x   5 root  admin      170 Sep  4 13:51 Users drwxrwxrwt@  3 root  admin      102 Sep  5 09:02 Volumes /code/pre  I realized that the folders with code@/code sign can not be displayed in Finder. Can somebody tell me what is the code@/code sign for and how i can remove it?  <answer144302> The code@/code sign means that the files have extended attributes. What you noticed was the extended attribute codecom.apple.FinderInfo/code, which can be modified to have Finder hide the file.  Using codels -@/code, you can see the extended attributes of the file.  This is what shows up when I run codels -dl@ Library/code when my Library folder is hidden:  precodedrwx------@ 54 me  staff  1836 Aug 31 11:16 Library      com.apple.FinderInfo   32 /code/pre  and when it is showing (a setting in Show View Options in Finder on your home directory):  precodedrwx------+ 54 me  staff  1836 Aug 31 11:16 Library /code/pre  The codecom.apple.FinderInfo   32/code  means that the file is hidden. (32 is just the bit  they chose to represent it, code1&lt;&lt;5/code. This is called a bitmask.)  You can hide and show files with codechflags hidden/code and codechflags nohidden/code, enabling and disabling that bit of codecom.apple.FinderInfo/code.
