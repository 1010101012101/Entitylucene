using -exec command on mac os x <body> Does any know why the code-exec/code does not work on mac os x lion terminal?  It works on linux and other variants but not on mac os x  precodefind / -iname "*.mp3" -exec mv {} /mnt/mp3 \; /code/pre  <comment59717> It works fine for me, although /mnt/mp3 isn't a location you're likely to find on OS X; if "mp3" is a mounted volume, generally it'll be mounted at /Volumes/mp3. <comment59722> Thanks Gordon. I created the /mnt directory manually .. <comment59723> Wouldn't it make more sense to move the mp3's to a place which exists on OSX already? <comment59724> Patrix, I know that but my point is that the command some odd reason doesn't work on my mac os x lion. The issue is not where the destination is. I'll see if I can post the error message.. <comment59725> I concur with @GordonDavisson â€“ that command works just fine as is. Are you certain that you have write rights to `/mnt/mp3`? <comment168744> Perhaps you omitted the space ahead of `\;` That yields the error: `find: -exec: no terminating ";" or "+"`.
