Windows XP doesn't recognize devices on Mac <body> I installed a Windows XP on an iMac beside Mac OS X. When i start Windows XP it appears that it doesn't recognize devices like network card, sound card and video card as well as other devices. It cannot connect to the internet, so i am trying to download the device drivers from the Mac OS.   Is there any way to do that, any links where can I download the drivers necessary for Windows XP to recognize all devices?  <answer192179> Plug in a USB drive that is formatted with FAT while on Mac OS and run Bootcamp Utility, then select the download Windows drivers option. Reboot back into Windows and run Bootcamp.exe/Setup.exe either from AutoPlay or manually.  <comment228511> Windows XP has not been supported under Boot Camp for several years now on recent hardware so depending on what Apple Hardware and version of (Mac) OS X you're running Windows XP may not be supported and therefore the directions from SÃ©bastien Fulmer may/may not be applicable.  If not the Windows XP Boot Camp Drivers might have to be downloaded directly from Apple's website under Downloads. That said next time you ask a question include your Apple Hardware information and what version of OS X you're running as it can make a difference in the answer to some questions.  Especially like this. <comment228530> You have to patch stock XP in order to read exFAT <comment228589> @JaimeSantaCruz Thanks, I'll remove it. <comment228591> With "beside OS X" you mean Bootcamp? Which OS X version are you running? <comment229942> Thanks @user3439894 My Apple hardware is an iMac (27-inch, Mid 2011),  and the version of (Mac) is OS X Lion 10.7.  Actually it is not Bootcamp, sorry i didn't mentioned that later, I am running each OS on a different partition, I tried Bootcamp but it doesn't work, I think I might try Windows 7 anyway. <comment229943> @Wassim Ayoub, According to [System requirements to install Windows on your Mac using Boot Camp](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204048) the **iMac (27-inch, Mid 2011)** _does not support Windows XP_.  Also since Windows XP is no longer supported with Security Updates for Consumer Users I'd strongly advise against even using it!  Windows 7 is a better choice however it will probably be difficult to find a legitimate retail version and at a reasonable price. <comment230026> Thanks @user3439894 i really appreciate!! your comments are very helpful
