how to disable Firefox's app tab glow? <body> I recently switched from Linux to Mac OS X, and one little tweak that didn't survive is disabling the blue highlight "glow" that Firefox adds to App Tabs when they have updates. Any idea how to do that?  I followed these instructions to disable it on Linux, but they don't work on Mac OS X. I have this in my code~/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/personal/chrome/userChrome.css/code file:  precode.tabbrowser-tab[pinned][titlechanged]:not([selected="true"]) {     background-image: none !important;     background: none !important; } /code/pre  ...but no luck. Putting other CSS rules in that file does work though.  I'm on Firefox 19.0 on Mountain Lion (10.8.2).  <answer85761> Put one of these snippets in your userChrome.css file, depending on your Firefox version:  h3Firefox 29 (Australis)/h3  precode.tabbrowser-tab[pinned][titlechanged]:not([selected="true"]) &gt; .tab-stack &gt; .tab-content {   background-image: none !important; } /code/pre  h3Pre-29/h3  precode#tabbrowser-tabs &gt; .tabbrowser-tab &gt; .tab-stack &gt; .tab-background * {     background: none !important; } /code/pre  Discovered by looking for code[titlechanged]/code selectors in browser.css (chrome://browser/skin/browser.css).  <comment98833> It seems, I found correct place, but can't reproduce glow effect at all. Can you help me? <comment99040> awesome, thanks! i'm testing this now. <comment99070> i was able to use those to write a `userChrome.css` setting that works. i've added it to your answer; please accept that edit when you get a chance. thanks again!!! <comment110044> updated again to handle all parts of the glow. (some had still been showing for the last few firefox releases.) <comment281225> `.tabbrowser-tab  .tab-stack  .tab-content[pinned][titlechanged]:not([visuallyselected="true"]) {` as of FireFox 44 (at least)
