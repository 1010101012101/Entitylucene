How to remove "XXX is an application downloaded from the internet. are you sure you want to open it" at start up? <body> Everytime I restart my mac, a pop up shows up telling me that "TunesGoWatch is an application downloaded from the internet. are you sure you want to open it?".   I don't know where this message comes from and I'm not sure how to get rid of it forever (I downloaded this app very long ago but uninstalled it) It pop ups automatically at start up.  <answer284429> The app is almost certainly in your Login items.  To check and remove it, do this:  ol liGo to Apple  System Preferences  Users &amp; Groups/li liMake sure your User Account is selected at top left/li liClick on the Login Items tab/li liLook for an item called emTunesGoWatch/em (or something else that could be triggering this) in the list of login items/li liNow remove this item by clicking on its name (so it's highlighted) and then clicking on the minus kbd-/kbd button/li liOnce it's removed, exit System Preferences/li liRestart your Mac to test to see if the problem still persists/li /ol  <answer284431> Best way I can think of to get rid of Wondershare is to do a thorough search &amp; trash everything you can find with that name &amp; also, while you're at it, iSkySoft who appear to be closely associated &amp; equally insidious.  First get hold of EasyFind from the App Store - freeware.  Set it to search the entire boot drive for wondershare, case insensitive, files &amp; folders &amp; also invisible items [Spotlight won't find these]  Any results you get for Wondershare just throw in the Trash.  Repeat for iskysoft, just in case.  Also repeat for 'tunesgowatch' just in case.  Empty Trash, reboot, wave bye bye, don't go near them again.  <comment358671> Ugh... Wondershare :/ There will be leftovers <comment358672> That did the trick, thanks <comment358674> Welcome - make sure you do it even if Monomeeth's answer worked. They are both really insidious companies & leave all kinds of "what the heck does that do?" stuff running in the background on your machine.
