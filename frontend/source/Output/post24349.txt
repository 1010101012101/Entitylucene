Why am I receiving this error code, when trying to rename a flash drive? <body> emBroken image removed/em   I receive this error upon attempting to rename a flash drive. The renaming process works, but I would like to know what this error is, and why it's appearing.  <answer24977> Have you tried reformatting the unit to FAT using disk utility and then trying to rename? FAT is the default filesystem for most USB sticks. I had this problem, reformatted it with disk util and it started working.   <comment27291> How is the drive formatted? What name are you attempting to assign to it? <comment27293> Well, as far as formatting goes, I have no idea. I just took it out of the package and used it. However, the name can be any valid name (no punctuation, correct length, etc.) and the error will still occur. <comment27299> I had some ideas, but I haven't been able to replicate your problem yet. What OS version are you running? Does this happen with all flash drives, or just this one? <comment27304> This is the only flash drive that I've experienced this error with. Mac OS X 10.7.1. <comment27305> Curiouser and curiouser. No luck so far in replicating your problem, but I'll keep at it. <comment27335> Have you tried reformatting the unit to FAT using disk utility and then trying to rename?

Thanks.
