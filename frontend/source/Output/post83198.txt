Recovering a locked iPod Touch <body> My kid has an iPod touch that has locked from too many attempts to enter the passcode for 22 million seconds. He did this before and I connected to iTunes and it successfully unlocked it. However, I have subsequently upgraded the computer that iTunes was on, and, although the original hard disk is readable, I can't boot it, and can't seem to repair it. Can I install iTunes on the new computer and copy over some key files or something like that from the original iTunes install to get this device unlocked?  <answer83343> Maybe you could try restoring the iPod touch? If you enter DFU mode (described below) and click Restore, you'll get the iPod back up and running.  strongTo enter DFU mode.../strong  ul liPress and hold the Home and Power buttons until the device turns off./li liWhen it does, hold Power for three seconds./li liThe device should turn on. Now hold the Home and Power buttons (DON'T LET GO OF Power) for ten seconds. The device should turn off - that's fine./li liLet go of Power -- keep holding Home until you hear your PC recognise the device./li /ul  The iPod touch should subsequently be available in iTunes as if it were in recovery mode; you should now be able to restore the device.  <comment95881> Have you thought about dropping by one of the Apple stores?  They do a lot of this kind of stuff free at their Genius bars. <comment136905> Is this the 1st generation? I've seen some of these that say the equivalent of 40 years in minutes. It might be a bug.
