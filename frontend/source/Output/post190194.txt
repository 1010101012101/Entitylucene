How can I remove all modifications I've made using 'defaults' <body> I've run a number of customization scripts and manually made a lot of changes in my environment using the codedefaults/code utility.  Is there a way I can delete all of my modifications? Essentially go back to all factory defaults?  <comment225718> `defaults` changes values in a config file/plist, there is no easy way to go back (unless you happen to know the full list of values changed *and* the previous/standard value).
