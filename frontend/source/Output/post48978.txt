Need a Presenter for the iPad  <body> I'm using my iPad to show several presentations. I use the Apple Keynote App. But it's not handy to run back to the iPad and flip to the next slide.     Is there any Hardware-Presenter (Bluetooth) for the iPad which works fine with the Keynote App?   There are quite a few for the Macintosh, but do they also work with the iPad?   There's an App for the iPhone, i know, but i haven't one at the moment.  <answer48984> Unfortunately it seems Keynote for iOS does not support generic bluetooth remotes.  See this question and the answers: Which iOS presentation/slideshow app can be controlled by a Trust Wireless bluetooth remote
