Mobile internet doesn't work <body> I have an iPhone 4s that is locked, but I'm using a Gevey SIM. Just recently I transfered from one operator to another and I can't get my internet to work, while everything is fine once I'm on Wi-Fi. When I put another SIM card in my phone, 3G internet works perfectly. The same happens when I put my SIM card in another phone, 3G works. It's just when I'm using my SIM card in my iPhone 4s, 3G doesn't work. Even my mobile phone operator doesn't know the answer. I was told I should change something in my APN settings, but I dont have that option to enter Cellular Data Network on my phone. Could someone help me?  <comment123750> My first thought is to reset the network setting in the phone. `Settings`- `General`- `Reset` - `Reset Network Settings`. Another option could be to restore the phone in iTunes. <comment123821> I did that, 2-3 times I reseted network settings, but nothing happened. If I restore the phone in iTunes, will it reset my update? Because my gevey sim only works for my current update..,
