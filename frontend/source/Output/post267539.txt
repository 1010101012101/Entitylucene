Time machine sparsebundle mounting error <body> When I try to mount my old (2015) sparsebundle in my time capsule it won't mount. If I try through disk utility won't appear, if I try through finder, for a second it will appear for a second in the Disk Utility bar, then disappear and getting the error "no activable filesystem " (I have the Mac in Italian, the error is "nessun filesystem attivabile"). I tried the hdiutil attach -nomount -readwrite flattop.sparsebundle but what I get is only  /dev/disk2    any clue how to mount the backup? thanks in advance to anyone
