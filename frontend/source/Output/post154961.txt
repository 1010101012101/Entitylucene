Standard Windows Keyboard - wrong keys recognised <body> I have a classic British Windows keyboard plugged into my Mac Mini. I'm sure I had it working but now it's not... I can choose between these two layouts but neither is correct:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6RE8Z.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lpXi4.png" alt="enter image description here"  My keyboard, like every other UK PC keyboard, has backslash to the left of Z, and nothing to the right of [ &amp; ].  How can I reset this - reinitialise the keyboard?  <answer154965> Delete the keyboard prefs file at code/Library/Preferences/com.apple.keyboardtype.plist/code &amp; reboot.br That should allow you to try again with the setup.  The layout you're looking for [I think] is this one for British PC, which looks correct for my standard UK PC extended keyboard.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DmuIW.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment182304> I should say I did originally get the "we don't recognise this keyboard, press the key next to the left shift key" (backslash) and I thought it was working. But that now seems to have been lost, can I force OSX to show the dialog again? <comment182331> Your machine thinks your "keyboard type" is ANSI, when it should be recognizing it as ISO.  Hopefully Tetsujin's answer will let you do that.  See also http://m10lmac.blogspot.com/2009/12/fixing-keyboard-type-problems.html <comment182373> I don't appear to _have_ that file. I do remember when the dialog came up I was asked to choose if it was ANSI or ISO as Tom mentions. But if it won't let me 'uninstall' the keyboard what can I do? <comment182381> Seems I don't have that file either, but I have an Apple keyboard which I understand may not need to generate one. I've pretty much exhausted my not inconsiderable Google-Fu on this & the best I can come up with is to connect a different keyboard, then if the assistant doesn't pop up,try manually running /System/Library/CoreServices/KeyboardSetupAssistant.app That may at least generate the file, giving you 2 options; swap back, or trash the file & swap back... I know.. the solution peters out badly at the end :) <comment182388> Ah, it was in /Library not ~/Library. It _seems_ to be working now. <comment182389> \o/ Glad you found it. I'll fix my Answer; apologies for the error. <comment182491> For some reason the picture of my keyboard layout is still wrong, not like yours, but it is working right. You don't have extra profiles installed or bootcamp do you? <comment182492> I have a Bootcamp Win 7 & Parallels Win XP, 7, 8 & 10 - but idk if any of those may have installed additional keyboard layouts, sorry.
