How to prevent MacVim from inheriting .profile as if it was Bash itself? <body> I have this guard in my code.profile/code:  precodeif [ -n "$BASH_VERSION" ]; then     if [ -f "$HOME/.bashrc" ]; then         . "$HOME/.bashrc"     fi      if [ -f "$HOME/.bash_aliases" ]; then         . "$HOME/.bash_aliases"     fi fi /code/pre  Still, I have verified the check is passing for MacVim started from Finder, not only from bash terminal, and code.bashrc/code contains terminal related script that seems to make MacVim not work as expected when started by double click, so I must have this check failing for non-terminal executions. I'm not sure whether this affects MacVim only or just any application. I was expecting code$BASH_VERSION/code empty for anything started from Finder.  Any tips?  <answer137354> There is a preference in MacVim to do this.  precodedefaults write org.vim.MacVim MMLoginShell 0 /code/pre  <comment160310> you might be better of asking that question on http://superuser.com/ <comment160401> [by debugging](http://superuser.com/questions/770137/how-to-prevent-macvim-from-inherenting-profile-as-if-it-was-bash-itself#comment999422_770137) I choosed to start using `$TERM_PROGRAM` instead of `$BASH_VERSION` in OS X now, this one works. <comment163206> I'm selecting this as an answer since it address the problem for MacVim although I'll keep employing my solution which fits better for my intentions. <comment163220> keep in mind that if you use MacVIm (GUI Mode) that i uses ~/.gvimrc if there or else it uses the gvimrc integrated inside of MacVIm.
