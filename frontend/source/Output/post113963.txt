sync the bookmarks in Favorites folder with a computer <body> I can only sync the bookmarks in the Bookmark folder on my iPad. Is there a way to sync the bookmarks in the Favorite folder too ?  I am syncing between iPad and Google chrome(Desktop)  EDIT: Here is a picture that explains it all.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sfJdn.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer114022> Ok, I found the bookmarks. They were already synced but apple has decided to put them in the main bookmarks bar inside Chrome. Not in the "Safari Menu bookmark"  <comment133610> Do you use Safari or Chrome on your iPad ? <comment133677> @MatthieuRiegler I Safari. Because the Favourite section is only in Safari
