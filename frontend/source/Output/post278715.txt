How to stop Mail from automatic "mark as read" behavior? (in Sierra) <body> I'm curious if there's a way to deactivate the feature/behavior in Mac Mail (Sierra) where mail is automatically marked as read when clicked (I want it to remain unread until I click otherwise). I know that I can use the "Classic View" to remove the preview feature, but that doesn't accomplish what I'm aiming for (I want the preview to remain active). And I know there used to be a plugin called TruePreview which offered this feature, but it's no longer available. Any ideas?  <comment350781> Related: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/132452/deactivate-automatic-mark-as-read-in-apple-mail-7-3?rq=1  Demand for such an option seems big enough that apparently you can make good money off it (see Mail Act-On plugin).
