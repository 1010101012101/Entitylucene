Iphone 6 plus facebook and instagram <body> My wife has an iphone 6 plus with iOs 9. She has her own facebook account (with friends). She also looks after my daughter's facebook and instagram accounts. What we want to do is link my daughter's instagram account with her facebook but when we try to do it instead of my daughter's friends linking , it is my wife's friends and contacts from her iphone. i have deleted the apps etc but no luck.  So I need Facebook A linked to iphone. Facebook B and instagram B linked together but on iphone not linked to it and not linked to facebook A.  How can we do this?
