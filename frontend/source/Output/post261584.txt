How can I wake up a MacBook with lid closed? <body> How can I wake up my MacBook pro with an iPhone, when the lid closed (no external display)? MacBook is not connected to power and there's a local wifi that it can connect to.  <answer261639> macOS Sierra, has an option in Energy Saver  Power Adapter to "Wake for Wi-Fi network access." In earlier versions that option was in Network preferences.  Apple Remote Access will wake a Mac this way but I am unaware of any iOS app that does this.  Generally speaking Wake On LAN (WOL) requires the sending device to send a so called "Magic Packet" and the receiving computer to be able to receive it and act upon it. I embelieve/em that Apple supports this method of WOL but I have not tested it in quite a while.  So your job will be to find an iOS app that provides WOL capability as it strongshould/strong do what you are looking for.  <comment327584> Why do you want to do this? <comment327604> If I wake it up, I can connect to it via TeamViewer and access files or control it. <comment327618> Yes, but for WOL to work Mac should be connected to wifi all the time. It does when connected to power, but when its on battery, I can't find it with a network scanning app (Fing), and can't send a "waking" signal. <comment327622> Then I guess you'll have to leave it connected to power for this to have any hope of working <comment327633> Maybe there's some trick or Bluetooth can help or.....something <comment327639> You can't if the MacBook is also asleep, as it won't keep a WiFi connection while it's not on. <comment327656> @JohnKeates well, maybe there's some trick to keep wifi connected and keep it only WOL mode or something. Maybe something could be done with Bluetooth or periphery <comment327659> The wireless hardware is switched off when the computer is not on/awake, so that's the actual problem. Also, WiFi doesn't work without the OS running. <comment327660> @JohnKeates but somehow when it's hooked to power and asleep (lid closed), I can wake it up remotely <comment327661> To expand on that: Wake on WiFi can only be made to work if the connection is up while the computer is not in standby or off, and only on recent systems (about 4 years). Often doesn't work if there is a Bonjour sleep proxy on a different physical link (but still on the same logical network). <comment327662> On power it doesn't go into standby. https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202124
