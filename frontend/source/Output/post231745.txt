How to Anti-alias Text and Screen in Preview? <body> I am studying carmel's answer found in the thread emHow to export non-blurry eps images?/em      [I]n Preview in Mac OS X, you can make the thin white diagonal lines   across each of the squares disappear by unchecking "Anti-alias text   and screen art". Of course, the downside is that then any text (e.g.   figure axes, etc) is not anti-aliased. Unfortunately, unchecking that   has no effect on blurriness if you're using imagesc.   The OP is not active in the userbase so I have to open this thread.  I would like to know more about those white diagonal lines across each of the squares.  I would like to get a basic example what he means by his claim.   hr  How can you reproduce the anti-alias method in Preview of Any OS X?
