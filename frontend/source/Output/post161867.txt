File browser with treeview <body> I am looking for a file browser for Mac OS X 10.10 (Yosemite) with as many following features as possible (approximately ordered by descending importance):  ul lihas a treeview along with the main pane/li liautomatically synchronize treeview with main pane/li lieditable address bar /li lipressing kbdENTER/kbd or mouse single left click on a folder/file opens it/li lidisplay file extension/li litabs/li lican display a folder's content as a detailed list /li libookmark / favorite/li lican display hidden files/li lia decent search feature/li liautomatically expand tree node on selection/li listill maintained/li /ul  hr  Macintosh Explorer (free) is the best I have found so far: it fits all requirements except that it is no longer maintained, does not automatically expand tree node on selection, pressing kbdENTER/kbd or mouse single left click on a folder/file does not open it.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sAdy5.png" alt="enter image description here"  MagicanFile (free) is another great option: it fits all requirements except that but it doesn't have tabs, It doesn't have bookmarks, pressing kbdENTER/kbd or mouse single left click on a folder/file does not open it, and the last update was Jun 29, 2011.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HveSH.png" alt="enter image description here"  Is there any other great option? I am basically looking for an equivalent of  Explorer++ (Windows).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hKnvM.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer161899> There is a app called Omni Disk Sweep.  It is meant to delete files, but it has a nice file view.  OmniDiskSweeper     OmniDiskSweeper is really great at what it does: showing you the files   on your drive, in descending order by size, and letting you decide   what to do with them. Delete away, but exercise caution. (Requires OS   X v10.8+)   And it looks like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QGEC1.jpg" alt="omni"  precodeYES has a treeview along with the main pane YES automatically synchronize treeview with main pane NO editable address bar YES pressing ENTER or mouse single left click on a folder/file opens it YES display file extension ? tabs YES can display a folder's content as a detailed list NO bookmark / favorite YES can display hidden files NO a decent search feature YES automatically expand tree node on selection YES still maintained YES shows all files (including system files)  /code/pre  One app to see fall files in organized manner in tree format (horizontal)  <answer161918> QuollEyeTree has many of these features http://binnie.id.au/QuollEyeTree.html  It was designed as a XTree/ZTreeWin implementation for OSX.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3HunF.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer182561> just stumbled onto your question. I use "Easy Explore", it's on the Mac Store. It fits all your requirements -except the tab feature:  https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/easy-explore/id789939414?mt=12  you could give it a go (even has picture preview functionality)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SY3dS.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer282407> XnViewMP (of all platforms) may be what you want. Although I find it for a image viewer, it works fine as a file manager, resembling the classic Windows File Manager. Configure the layout as you wish. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Lp7lK.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment189169> Thanks. It doesn't have a treeview (like in the screenshots in put in the question) though: I don't want to have one column per tree level :( It also has almost no feature. <comment189172> Thanks. I don't think it has any feature Macintosh Explorer does not, but at least it is still maintained! <comment189173> By "pain" he means "pane". <comment189174> @GEdgar Thanks, Mac Dictation can be paneful to use! <comment189175> It is just the column view from finder but shows the size all directories and you cannot do anything but delete from it - so nothing like what the question asks for <comment189182> @FranckDernoncourt I am biassed (being the author), but it does lots. It is principally designed to be used with the keyboard e.g. 'O' will Open a file (not "Enter" which has other functionality). <comment189183> Thanks, I didn't realize there were so [many keyboard shortcuts](http://binnie.id.au/Downloads/QuollEyeTree.pdf). That's very good to know as I use voice recognition for most tasks and could bind voice commands to some shortcuts.  By the way any idea regarding [Moving the treeview to the left side in QuollEyeTree](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/161925/20338)? <comment189184> @FranckDernoncourt I explored lots of options early on, but was heavily influenced by ZTreeWin. "Enter" in file window will toggle this to use the full height (showing the max no of files), but I will look at the possibility. <comment189328> @Mark thank you for your opinion! Your assessment is wrong. See the table showing it accomplishes over 80% of all requirements without a need to install another 3d party app. <comment189329> @FranckDernoncourt I proposed it in the effort of trying to eliminate installing another 3d party app, since one newer knows what problems they might bring. I also updated my answer highlighting the features it has. <comment189330> Given that description doesn't Finder in column mode do more? <comment189336> @Mark, granted it is similar yet different view. My motivation is to avoid installing another 3d party apps, and the QuallEyeTree for example is to intrusive in to OS X operations for my taste. <comment297106> I might have missed this, and the OP might not have asked for it, but I didn't find a "Duplicate folder" function, which would be really handy. A great program none-theless. Ditto Easy Explore, written up below. <comment297107> I might have missed this, and the OP might not have asked for it, but I didn't find a "Duplicate folder" function, which would be really handy.
