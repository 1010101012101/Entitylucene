How to reinstall macOS Sierra after formatting by Ubuntu <body> I recently experienced a problem with my macOS Sierra that forced me to reinstall it. However the internet connection was bad, so I ended up installing Ubuntu 17 from USB instead.  Iâ€™ve now reformatted my hard disk and torrented a macOS Sierra installer. How can I burn it onto a USB stick?  <answer294694> great idea to download it from a torrent from piratebay.... strongNOT/strong !!!  and I don't know, how to burn something on a USB stick...  but.... perhaps this may help you:  http://lpmv.epfl.ch/macosx  https://askubuntu.com/questions/620284/how-to-make-a-bootable-mac-usb-in-ubuntu  https://superuser.com/a/505832/401026  ul liwhen done: start Mac, press and hold "Alt" to get boot menu/li lichoose USB stick/li lifollow the instructions/li /ul  <answer294696> I have had a similar situation with a friend of mine who installed a bad copy of Windows 7 onto their mac.   You can retry booting into strongInternet Recovery Mode/strong. If a local recovery partition isn't found, which in your case it won't be due to the hard drive formatting, the Mac will try to recover the operating system over the internet. To force a Mac into internet recovery mode, hold strongOption-Cmd-R/strong at startup. This process will take some time, and you will need to select a suitable Wi-Fi or other Internet connection once the computer has started up.   More information on macOS recovery can be found on Apple's support site  Best of luck to you, and note it is probably strongemnot/em/strong the best idea to install a pirated copy of macOS Sierra.   EDIT:  As for "burning" things onto a USB stick, this tool may help you.   <answer294698> If you can get your hands onto another Mac, you can try the following (described also in this Apple KB article:  ol liDownload the macOS installer from the Mac App Store. Quit the installer if it opens automatically after downloading. The installer will be in your Applications folder./li liMount your USB flash drive or other volume. You could also use a secondary internal partition that has at least 12GB of available disk space for the installation files./li liOpen the Terminal app, which is in the Utilities folder of your Applications folder./li liUse the createinstallmedia command in Terminal to create the bootable installer. For detailed usage instructions, make sure that the appropriate macOS installer is in your Applications folder, then enter the following path in Terminal:  /Applications/Install\ macOS\ Sierra.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia/li /ol  <comment371961> Do you have the ability to get your hands on to another mac? <comment371967> No unfortunately, not a lot of Mac users in my city <comment371975> You only "burn" to optical media, e.g. _burn to DVD_. You "write" to a USB Flash Drive! Setting aside the illegalities of downloading a torrent of macOS, it's just not a good idea since you have no way of knowing if its been modified in a malicious manner. Go to an Apple store or acquire a copy of the macOS installer in a legitimate manner and write it to a USB Flash Drive, per Apple's instructions available at their website, boot your Mac with it, format the drive and install. Otherwise find a location you can reliably use Internet Recovery from.
