Running an applescript on application launch <body> Specifically, I would like to automatically close any VPN connections in the Pulse Secure app (presumably using an AppleScript) whenever I open a specific application, say, iTunes. Preferably, such a script would not exit Pulse Secure in doing so.  I have tried to create an automator script to achieve this, but with no success.  <comment359230> Welcome to Ask Different! :) You really need to clarify what you've already done. Can you detail what you did with Automator? Also, please include what code you've already tried using.
