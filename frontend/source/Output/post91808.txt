iTunes deciding not to update podcasts <body> iTunes, trying to be helpful, automatically stops updating my podcasts when it thinks I've not listened to them recently enough. It's quite maddening!  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HjaIP.png" alt="iTunes has stopped updating this podcast"  How can I turn off this "helpful" feature?  <comment107871> I've googled this and not found any good workaround, I'd love to see a permanent hack that kills this 'feature'.
