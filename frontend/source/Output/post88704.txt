How to set up ZEVO / ZFS on an internal disk while maintaining full disk encryption? <body> It seems that it's currently impossible to have the entire boot drive converted to ZFS.  How would one go about converting a single disk HFS+ Filevault 2 setup into a setup which has full encryption and most of the advantages of ZFS?  I imagine that there will have to remain a boot partition which is HFS+ and all user data would have to somehow live on an encrypted ZFS partition that will get auto-mounted and perhaps symlinked to /Users ...   I'm on 10.8.3 and with CE Zevo (1.1)  <answer106867> Short answer … two Core Storage logical volumes, both encrypted:   ul lione LV, HFS Plus/li lithe other LV, give to ZEVO. /li /ul  You'll need ZEVO Community Edition 1.1.1 (1.1 is outdated).   In the answer to the linked question there's a note about Mountain Lion; OS X 10.8.5 makes things a little more difficult.   <comment103952> Paging [Graham Perrin](http://apple.stackexchange.com/users/8546/graham-perrin). . . . GJ - You'll want to explicitly list a version of OS X and ZEVO/ZFS if you have any constraints you wish to have in force. You clearly can do this on Lion following the link above. <comment103955> Are you referring to something like this? http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/52919/how-can-zfs-be-used-with-encryption-on-os-x Look at the answer by Graham Perrin. <comment103974> Thanks. I'm on 10.8.3 and CE Zevo, so would appreciate and up to date answer as well as a bit more newbie-friendly instructions than those found in Graham's previous answer. <comment125416> Sorry, I missed the alert! <comment125628> Thanks, but I am mostly wondering about how to elegantly set up the Users to live on a different volume and auto-mount etc. Perhaps this isn't a zevo/zfs-specific question but is nevertheless essential in this context due to zevo's inability to work for boot partitions.
