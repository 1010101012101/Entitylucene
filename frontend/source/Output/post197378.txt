How to allow my Mac OS X 10.10.4 to download from sourceforge.net? <body> I'm trying to install QUCS(Quite Universal Circuit Simulator) to my Macbook.  Following link, http://qucs.sourceforge.net/build.html , I used Homebrew and follow the instructions in the section, Build instructions for MacOS,   I got an error msg saying:  curl: (22) The requested URL returned error: 404 Not Found Error: Failed to download resource "adms" Download failed: http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/mot-adms/adms-source/2.3/adms-2.3.4.tar.gz?r=&amp;ts=1437800272  After some investigation, I found out my Mac doesn't allow me to download any types of files from source.net.  Although I changed my preferences in "Security &amp; Privacy" to "Allow apps downloaded from: Anywhere," but it doesn't help.   I also turned off my firewall, but nothing changed.   Does anyone have an idea what's going on?    <answer197382> SourceForge is having issues right now. Others are having trouble downloading also. You may end up having to request the author upload the binaries to another source.  I am pretty sure if it was an issue with your configuration, you'd still be able to download just not run, or not have access to the internet at all.  <comment235966> "404 Not Found Error" has nothing to do with your security settings, that's the server (downloads.sourceforge.net) giving an error that it doesn't have anything by that name.
