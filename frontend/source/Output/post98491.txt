Recycle Bin isn't working: all the files are deleted immediately and completely <body> Well, I don't know what happening on my MTL 10.8.4, but yesterday file deleting became very strange. When I press codecmd/code+codebackspace/code dialog window with two variants is shown: Delete and Cancel. So the Delete button removes a file completely, and bin is empty then. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vH7kk.png" alt="enter image description here"  So how I can fix that?  <answer98492> In the terminal, enter the following:  ls ~/.Trash  If you get a response "No such file or directory", then just simply restart your Mac. If not, then type this to the terminal if you're an admin:  sudo rm -ri ~/.Trash  Follow the prompts, then restart your Mac.

I found another solution. <comment115694> You should have been able to do this as `mkdir ~/.Trash` if that failed you have other permissions issues with ~
