Grow Main OS X Partition (Messy) <body> When I first got my MacBook (late 2013), I repartitioned to dual boot Ubuntu and OS X (Ubuntu Live using GParted), to split my disk in two equal partitions, plus (Linux) swap, plus a Linux/grub boot partition in front.  I never used the Ubuntu, and I'm running low on space, so...  ol liI want back all but say 50 GB (just in case I try to dual boot later, though not required, as it's unlikely).  I already partitioned off the 50 GB, and moved the two recovery partitions to the end of the drive.  The problem is growing the OS X partition.  Some answers do this by reverting / deleting the CoreStorage, which I wasn't sure was a good idea./li liI also seem to have two Recovery Partitions, for whatever reason.  Do I need them both?/li /ol  I already have a bootable thumb drive, with Ubuntu 16.04, where I have used GParted to try to clean up a little.  It is happy to shrink the OS X partition further, but not expand it.  I've seen a couple of interesting pages on this site, but I wasn't sure if they are deleting and recovering?  I'm trying to avoid any sort of fresh install / recover from backup if I can avoid it (time and risk of missing / losing something).  Plus, some things have changed since Sierra, such as the diskutil, etc.  Here's where I am at now:  precoderoot# gpt -r -vv show /dev/disk0 gpt show: /dev/disk0: mediasize=500277790720; sectorsize=512; blocks=977105060 gpt show: /dev/disk0: Suspicious MBR at sector 0 gpt show: /dev/disk0: Pri GPT at sector 1 gpt show: /dev/disk0: Sec GPT at sector 977105059       start       size  index  contents           0          1         MBR           1          1         Pri GPT header           2         32         Pri GPT table          34          6          40     409600      1  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B      409640  486443384      2  GPT part - 53746F72-6167-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC   486853024  380760064   867613088    1269344      3  GPT part - 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC   868882432    1269760      4  GPT part - 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC   870152192  106952835   977105027         32         Sec GPT table   977105059          1         Sec GPT header /code/pre  Here it is with labels:  precoderoot# gpt -r -vv show -l /dev/disk0 gpt show: /dev/disk0: mediasize=500277790720; sectorsize=512; blocks=977105060 gpt show: /dev/disk0: Suspicious MBR at sector 0 gpt show: /dev/disk0: Pri GPT at sector 1 gpt show: /dev/disk0: Sec GPT at sector 977105059       start       size  index  contents           0          1         MBR           1          1         Pri GPT header           2         32         Pri GPT table          34          6          40     409600      1  GPT part - "EFI System Partition"      409640  486443384      2  GPT part - "Macintosh HD"   486853024  380760064   867613088    1269344      3  GPT part - "Recovery HD"   868882432    1269760      4  GPT part - "Recovery HD"   870152192  106952835   977105027         32         Sec GPT table   977105059          1         Sec GPT header /code/pre  diskutil list results  precoderoot# diskutil list /dev/disk0 (internal, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.3 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:          Apple_CoreStorage Macintosh HD            249.1 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             649.9 MB   disk0s3    4:                  Apple_HFS Recovery HD             650.1 MB   disk0s4  /dev/disk1 (internal, virtual):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                            Macintosh HD           +248.7 GB   disk1                                  Logical Volume on disk0s2                                  5A90DCA7-01B1-410E-843D-B91EA88B7055                                  Unencrypted /code/pre  Corestorage Results:  precoderoot# diskutil cs list CoreStorage logical volume groups (1 found) | +-- Logical Volume Group 90567D12-797A-4CA2-A9E7-FCE7A58188BE     =========================================================     Name:         Macintosh HD     Status:       Online     Size:         249059012608 B (249.1 GB)     Free Space:   18935808 B (18.9 MB)     |     +-&lt; Physical Volume E55B556C-D297-4596-A42A-86FBB85755CB     |   ----------------------------------------------------     |   Index:    0     |   Disk:     disk0s2     |   Status:   Online     |   Size:     249059012608 B (249.1 GB)     |     +-&gt; Logical Volume Family A239F8C5-E522-48F4-ACB9-C18BF5523CCD         ----------------------------------------------------------         Encryption Type:         None         |         +-&gt; Logical Volume 5A90DCA7-01B1-410E-843D-B91EA88B7055             ---------------------------------------------------             Disk:                  disk1             Status:                Online             Size (Total):          248687755264 B (248.7 GB)             Revertible:            Yes (no decryption required)             LV Name:               Macintosh HD             Volume Name:           Macintosh HD             Content Hint:          Apple_HFS /code/pre  Thanks in advance for any help. Sincerely, Allan.  <comment323188> This is a horrible question! â€¢ it contains at least 5 questions! All questions have an answer here. Any possible answer only repeats something already written here - maybe summarized, maybe served as tidbits. *It's so special that it is almost personal troubleshooting...* <comment323366> I reduced the scope of the question, as soon as I read Klanomath's comment.  He was of course correct, I originally had too many questions.  The rest is information I thought would be needed, based in fact on some other posts I read here.  This is my first question, something I have been wrestling with for a few days now, and I would greatly appreciate any help.  Including editing of my question to make it somehow a better fit.  Really I just need to grow that partition, non-destructively. <comment323367> [Don't use GParted to shrink OS X CoreStorage partitions](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/257056/corrupted-macos-partition-after-gparted/257138). Have you done this already? The CS partition is disk0s2 (or disk0 index 2). <comment323370> My answer to the linked page/question may be a blue print for an answer. Depends on what you have already modified and the tools you have used.
