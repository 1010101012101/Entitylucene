Question about how networked users work <body> As I'm waiting for my new gleaming iMac to arrive, I'm considering buying OS X Server since it's only $20 now and offers Open Directory.    We have two MacBook Pros, so I'd like to have all of us able to log into any of the 3 Macs with our ID.  ol liCan I simply switch from a local user to a network user without losing my home directory contents?/li liIs it just my home directory that is mirrored on the server? Or is it all the applications I've installed etc. For example, if I install an application on Laptop A will it show up on Laptop B?/li liI assume that when I have the laptop somewhere that the server is not available, that I can still get to all my home directory contents.  They will then magically sync back up when I get back to my regular network?/li /ol  <answer78883> I did get some feedback over at StackExchange: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14221782/detail-on-how-os-x-networked-users-works  Closing this thread.
