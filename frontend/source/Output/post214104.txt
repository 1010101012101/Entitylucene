Available SSD disk space shrinking within seconds <body> My SSD's available disk space of my MacMini Late 2012 is shrinking within seconds. CleanMyMac says 'Others''s size is increasing. I have no idea what is happening and am wondering why there is so few free space on my Mac. I am not downloading anything (as far as I know).br  Here is my activity monitor's 'Disk' tab: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GDnaG.png" alt="activity monitor"  ...and the 'Memory' tab: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TYsWn.png" alt="activity monitor #2"  Any idea why this is happening and what I can do?  Thanks in advance!  PS: In this video you can see the process. (It's not sped up, real time!)  <comment258440> Please add a screenshot of Activity Monitor - disk or/and memory <comment258441> Did so, sorry for German language. <comment258444> I'm german so it's no problem ;-).
