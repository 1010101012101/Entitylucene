How can I replace the 'Linen' that is prevalent in many Lion apps? <body> There are many places where the "linen" texture is used in Lion, from the Login Window to various app backgrounds like Safari and so on.  Is it possible to replace this image with something else?  Let's say I have a nice hessian weave pattern from a lovely house I lived in that hasn't been decorated since 1979, or some sand, or a patchwork quilt depicting the transperambulation of pseudo cosmic anti matter?  Whatever I wish to change it to, a) can I change it, and b) will it change it for emall instances/em where the linen appears, or does each application have it's own resources which would need ammending one by one with differing methods, and c) is there a particular size/fileformat/other feature that any replacement image must have, for example must it be a 200x200 PNG that tesselates etc.  <answer44946> The linen backdrop file is code/System/Library/Frameworks/AppKit.framework/Versions/C/Resources/NSTexturedFullScreenBackgroundColor.png/code  You can edit that file, or replace it with a file of the same name, but be certain that the replacement file has a resolution of 72 pixels per inch or you probably won't like the result.  ᔥ John Martellaro: OS X Lion: Change Login Screen’s Dirty Linen  Certain applications and situations draw their background from different sources. for example, the background file for Mission Control can be found at code/System/Library/CoreServices/Dock.app/Contents/Resources/defaultdesktop.png/code  If you replace that file, you'll need to do a codekillall Dock/code command in the terminal before the change will take effect.  ᔥ OS X Daily: Change the Mission Control Background Wallpaper Image in Mac OS X Lion  <answer44950> You can change the linen of the login background, but I've not seen this change affect other places (e.g. reading list in safari).

I found this webpage useful in identifying why it was that it wouldn't change when the others would:     Safari on Lion has a different linen pattern than Mission Control or   the system’s login screen. It’s lighter and more subtle, and it can be   appreciated when navigating between webpages with the new gestures.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jvWKR.png" alt="enter image description here"  So it seems that for Safari and Reading List the image is probably a part of the Safari Application Bundle, which I will now start to investigate more thoroughly.  <answer47121> subThis is an answer which is for the bounty only./sub  hr  h2Linen Background Safari's reading list/h2  The background of the reading list in Safari is located at...  precode/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Safari.framework/Versions/A/Resources/ReadingList-BGLinen.png /code/pre  The replacement file needs to be of the same name, size and DPI.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AqaXW.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer47125> h2Removing linen in Safari/h2  Safari uses two different sources of linen, one for scrolling past the edge of the page or resizing the page in full-screen mode, and one for use behind the Reading List. To replace the Reading List linen, gentmatt has identified the file you need to replace. Replacing the linen you see when you scroll past the edge of the page, however, is slightly trickier.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gCOau.png" alt="enter image description here"  h3Here's how to change it:/h3  ol liYou will need administrator access to make these changes.

For simplicity, I just adjusted the color on mine, but it does demonstrate that it works:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OAY93.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment51138> Also http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/33514/5472 has some color on this issue. <comment53840> I found `/System/Library/CoreServices/Dock.app/Contents/Resources/ecsb_background_tile.png` and `ecsb_background_gradient.png` (in the same folder) but these aren’t what Safari uses either. I checked the Safari Application bundle and it’s not in there as a PNG file. <comment53855> Do you use Reading List? I have a way to change the linen when you scroll past the page, but I can't yet find a way to change the linen behind the reading list. <comment53946> Yes I do, not heavily, but occasionally. <comment53960> Bounty Hunter Badge awarded. ;) <comment53961> @jaberg Haha! Yeah, we need that badge. <comment53964> What about the linen when you scroll off the end of the page? <comment53965> @KyleCronin I don't know. It's definitely a different one because it's darker. <comment53966> @stuffe OK, looks like gentmatt covered that so I'll post what I found. Since we both have half the answer, how will you award the bounty? <comment53968> @gentmatt OK, just wanted to see if you had figured that out too. I posted my solution to it. <comment54017> Bounty goes to Kyle because the answer took a lot of research by the look of it.  Will reward GentMatt by bunting one of his outstanding answers elsewhere <comment224799> FYI, the link to "Lion Designer" no longer works. Appears to be going to a domain-squatter landing page now.
