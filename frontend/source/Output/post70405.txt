How do I remove the previous App Store user from my computer? <body> Someone else at the office was attempting to help me setup the laptop before I started, so now my MBP has their credentials for some apps. I can uninstall and reinstall the app, if that's all it takes, but how do I remove this user from the system so it quites prompting me?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/L3fEk.png" alt="Image showing me updating App Store apps and it prompting me to use another account"  <answer70407> Try to change account into System Settings - iCloud.  (duplicate of Being asked to log into a different account on Mac App Store?)  <answer70408> The App Store app uses spotlight to find all the apps on your Mac that were downloaded from the store. You simply need to delete all those apps from the Mac (your personal data and settings do not get deleted) and re-download the app. Of course, you'll want to sign out from that account if you haven't done that yet. When the app is running choose the strongStore - Sign Out/strong menu item.   The details on how the App Store app actually knows if an app was downloaded is buried inside the application bundle as descrtibed on this quesiton about avoiding updates to apps entirely.  ul liHow can I opt out of updates for one app when using the App Store? /li /ul  <comment81707> I'm the only one logged into iCloud as far as I can tell? I mean, nobody was there, then I logged in like two weeks ago. I would've noticed if someone were logged in there. <comment81713> How can I tell if that user is still "signed in"? <comment81716> The iCloud settings have nothing to do with clearing an App Store account. I suppose it might be where the initial setup happened, but you'll have to go elsewhere to fix this issue. See my answer for details. <comment243782> Be sure to empty the trash after deleting them, or the App Store won't consider them in need of re-download.
