Mavericks menu bar Wi-Fi icon does not refresh <body> In Mac OS X 10.9, once I am connected to a Wi-Fi station the menu bar Wi-Fi icon no longer refresh (the spinning wheel does not appear). This complicates station switching as I have to turn off and on the Wi-Fi.   Do you know how to revert this behavior to how it worked in Mac OS X 10.8, or an alternative tool to make Wi-Fi connections?  Update: As I mention  below, I realized that rebooting the machine the Wifi icon refreshes until I Fast Switch to another account. In this precise moment it stop working.  <answer148588> Here are few steps to try-  A- To check your functionality  run the   precodeairport -s /code/pre  in Terminal.   That should show you the scan results.  B- If there are no results check your hardware profile in About this Mac (this is mine)  Card Type: AirPort Extreme  (0x14E4, 0xE9)   Firmware Version: Broadcom BCM43xx 1.0 (5.106.98.100.22)   MAC Address:  14:10:9f:f0:29:8c  Check the com.apple.airport.airportutility.plist for been up to date (recent) or just delete it.  C- If above worked then your WiFi Icon in the menu bar is broken.  Press and hold the kbdcmd/kbd key and drag the WiFi Icon to desktop (and it will vanish).  Restart.  Go to   precode/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu Extras /code/pre  And click on      AirPort.menu   That will bring your WiFi Icon back (hopefully working this time).  <comment172566> Do you have the "looking for Networks" wheel turning when you click on the WiFi icon? Also, try holding the alt key and click. <comment172696> I have added to the post that "the spinning wheel does not appear" <comment172745> Thanks for clarification. Next question: If you use the Join Other networks does it scan?, Also if you hold the alt and click on the wifi at the bottom there will be Open Wireless diagnostics- in there select the Window tab- Utility and scan. <comment172805> Alt-clicking the Wi-Fi icon shows extended information about the current connection but does not rescan. Does your Mac OS X 10.9 rescan when you click the Wi-Fi icon? My Mac OS X 10.8 and early did it, but Mac OS X 10.9 no longer rescan. <comment172806> I have the 10.9.5 on a MacBook Air, and yes it does rescan when I click on the WiFi Icon (there is a very small delay before it starts scanning. <comment175052> This partially solve the problem. If I cmd-drag the WiFi icon and reboot, the WiFi icon works. I realized that it works until I Fast Switch to another account. In this precise moment it stop working. BTW, I cannot find the file com.apple.airport.airportutility.plist in ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.airport.airportutility.plist or any other place. <comment175112> Great, it solves the problem! The new problem with fast user switching should be new question. I would recommend you post it with Console report so to see what is going on at that time stamp. It is not in System (~) Library, just copy my line from the answer. <comment175374> Repair both Users accounts ACL's.
