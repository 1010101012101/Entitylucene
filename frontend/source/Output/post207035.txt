Missing the Health.app on my iPhone? <body> I lost icon for the Health.app (the one with the Heart icon) on my iPhone. How do I get it back?  <answer225767> Go to Setings  General  Restrictions and enable it.  Do nothing and re-enable it, the app should be back  <answer260085> The answer to choose settings was correct for iOS 9 and earlier.  On iOS 10 you could have deleted the app and need to re-download it from the App Store.  Also - if you have a provisioning profile that disables that app by policy, you would have to remove that restriction or get the administrator that supervised your iOS device to remove that restriction.  <comment249643> Health is a built-in app, it's complete disappearance is highly unlikely. Try searching for it in Spotlight.
