Ipod touch activation lock 3 years after <body> So, 3 years ago I found an Ipod touch.  I did everything in my power (calling schools, taking a photo of my contact info with the Ipod in case photos were streamed, craig's list ad, checking to see if the serial number was registered, etc.,etc.) to find the owner.  After months, a co-worker "wiped" the ipod and it became mine.  Suddenly, last night, the activation lock appears.    Could the original owner have just done this 3 years after it was lost emand/em after it was "wiped" and reset?  I am having zero success at remembering my apple id (although I definitely know my password).  Any suggestions for me?  Thanks.
