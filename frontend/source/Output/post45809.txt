Set ForkLift as default file viewer <body> Is there a way to set ForkLift as the default file viewer, to a degree? PathFinder somehow does this, see http://cocoatech.com/faqs#3, but how does it do this and could that option be set to redirect to ForkLift instead of PathFinder?  <answer45831> Path Finder looks like it's modifying the "NSFileViewer" preference. You can set this manually from Terminal to point to ForkLift (I tried this, and it seems to work):  precodedefaults write -g NSFileViewer -string com.binarynights.ForkLift2 /code/pre  (The code-g/code sets this preference globally for all applications.)  However, be warned that the Path Finder website lists some applications that don't respect this setting, such as the Dock and Firefox.  <answer173556> You can change default file manager like this, but ForkLift or Transmit not work as expected, only Path Finder are  precode#!/usr/bin/python2.6  from LaunchServices import LSSetDefaultRoleHandlerForContentType, kLSRolesViewer, LSSetDefaultHandlerForURLScheme from CoreFoundation import CFPreferencesCopyApplicationList, kCFPreferencesCurrentUser, kCFPreferencesAnyHost, CFPreferencesSetAppValue, CFPreferencesAppSynchronize  applicationBundleIdentifier = "com.cocoatech.PathFinder" #"com.panic.Transmit" #"com.binarynights.forklift2"  LSSetDefaultRoleHandlerForContentType("public.folder", kLSRolesViewer, applicationBundleIdentifier) LSSetDefaultHandlerForURLScheme("file:///", applicationBundleIdentifier)  applicationIDs = CFPreferencesCopyApplicationList(kCFPreferencesCurrentUser, kCFPreferencesAnyHost) for app_id in applicationIDs:     CFPreferencesSetAppValue("NSFileViewer", applicationBundleIdentifier, app_id);     CFPreferencesAppSynchronize(app_id); /code/pre  <comment52247> The `-g` flag is equivalent to `NSGlobalDomain`. It simply writes the preference to the global domain, rather than to a specific domain. <comment52462> Very interesting, thanks! Seems to work well for the applications that do support it! <comment61549> how do I revert to using Finder? <comment61648> Try `defaults delete -g NSFileViewer`. <comment270748> @jtbandes Any ideas to make it work with Alfred and Chrome? It just opens the file(s) instead of displaying it's location. <comment270749> @whitesiroi Sorry, not sure what you mean. As far as I can remember this question/answer doesn't have anything to do with Alfred or Chrome. <comment270750> @jtbandes Thank you for such a fast response ^^ Here is the same question  https://www.reddit.com/r/applehelp/comments/u3oqe/help_with_show_in_finder/ Thank you. <comment270751> It sounds like a separate question from this one. You can [ask a new question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/ask) <comment344980> For ForkLift 3, the command is `defaults write -g NSFileViewer -string com.binarynights.ForkLift-3`
