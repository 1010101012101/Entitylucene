Remapping keys to match Windows <body> I'm completely new to the Mac and I have a whole lot of problems with the shortcuts etc.  Is it possible to remap the keys to match my windows expirience? For example I'd like to have CTRL+C, CTRL+V as Copy &amp; Paste.  <answer10473> go to system preferences -- Keyboard -- Keyboard Shortcut from left windows choose Application Shortcut and in the below of right window press + button and in Application choose All application and in menu title choose codeCopy/code and in keyboard shortcut press codectrl+c/code and do the same thing for paste shortcut.  <answer10492> What I recommend for you is remapping the keys so that pressing the Control button on your keyboard tells you computer that you're pressing command. That way, you can use the button you're used to automatically without having to set up each shortcut you want. Here's how:  Go to System Preferences (in your Applications folder) and click codeKeyboard/code. Go to the codeKeyboard/code tab and click the codeModifier Keys.../code button.  Select your keyboard from the codeSelect keyboard.../code menu. brTo give yourself a Windows-like experience, do the following: brIn the first menu, Leave codeCaps Lock/code alone. brSet the second menu to codeCommand/code so that the line reads like this: codeControl (^) Key: âŒ˜ Command/code brChange the third menu to codeOption/code. brChange the fourth menu to codeControl/code.  With this setup, pressing the codeContro/codel button will make the computer think you've pressed codeCommand/code. So, any shortcut that says codecommand-v/code will work when you press codecontrol-v/code. The option key behaves like the alt key. The command button works as the control key usually does on a Mac. You can use it for things such as right-clicking.  Hope this works for you!  <answer83096> The best solution I found was the free KeyRemap4MacBook utility -- it lets you change the keyboard in many ways. My personal modifications (for the MacBook Air 2012 model):  ul li"fn + cursor left/right" for Home/End and "fn + up/down" for PgUp/PgDown, via emFor PC Users/em: emUse PC Style Home/End/em, emUse PC Style PageUp/PageDown/em/li liswitching the function keys to work like on "PC" notebooks, i.e. F1-F12 without modifier and "fn + Fx" for the screen brightness etc changes, via emFunctional Keys to F1..F12/em plus emFn+F1..F12 to Functional Keys/em./li /ul  <comment10995> You really should learn the Mac way of doing shortcuts (the Command key). After a few weeks of using both platforms, your brain will learn to use Command on the Mac and Control on Windows without you having to think about it. <comment11005> This will certainly work, but it's less than ideal to have to reconfigure every shortcut, especially since not all apps obey SysPrefs-configured shortcuts. <comment11182> Didn't work for me :( <comment11183> That's not an option. I need it remapped. <comment11200> Why is is not an option?
