Folder created in Photoshop not showing up in finder <body> This is really crazy issue i'm experiencing here:  I downloaded the newest Photoshop CC 2015 and started working with it to crop some images for a client. After that, i've saved all the images for the web in a folder i created with the save-tool from photoshop.  Now when i navigate in the finder to that path the folder does not show up, but when i make ls in iTerm it shows me that the folder is there.  Strange, huh?   Whats wrong? Is the Photoshop version buggy? Even normal saving the .psd makes it disappear.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LvUZW.png" alt="finder"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8Da8Q.png" alt="iTerm"  <answer194143> codechflags nohidden path/to/the/file/code will unhide your file in Finder.   <comment231492> not working.. also in the "all my files"-section the new saved files aren't showing <comment231632> okay after reboot the folder is visible again.. strange things happen
