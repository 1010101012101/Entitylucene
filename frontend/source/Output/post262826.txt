Is this a search bug in Safari or on purpose? <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GnNqz.png" alt="search &quot;application&quot;"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8Ki94.png" alt="search &quot;lication&quot;"  It seems Safari only recognize whole words ("application"), or start of the words ("a"). However if search "lication" it will give you nothing.  Is this a bug? Or a "feature"?  <comment329273> @NetherLinks Thanks :)
