Trouble with iCloud signing request <body> How can I keep my iPad from asking me to log in to iCloud?br I don't want anything to do with iCloud and I don't want to be constantly hounded by Apple to log in.  <answer162149> Try under codeSettings/code  codeiCloud/code  codeSign Out/code at the bottom of the page. You shouldn't be prompted for a password again until you sign in under the same menu.  hr  h2Edit 1/h2  Not sure whether that's exactly what you meant, but I cannot seem to recall Apple asking for a log in when no data is entered under the iCloud tab.  <comment189511> Having an iDevice & not wanting any connection to iCloud is a bit like having a car but not wanting it to need petrol
