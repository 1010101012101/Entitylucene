Set default mail client without adding mail account <body> I'm on OSX el capitan (10.11.6).  I use outlook to access my email and would like outlook to be the default mail application. All the instructions I find online suggest that I should open mail and choose "Mail - Preferences" to set the default mail app. Unfortunately Preferences is greyed out until an account is added. I don't have another account that I want to add to my mac.  How can I set the default mail client to Outlook without adding an account to the mail client?  <answer261884> Sometimes the easiest solutions stare us in the face and it's easy to overlook them. I get asked this regularly and the emeasiest way to do this/em is to just set up Apple Mail with your email account and emthen/em change the default email application to Outlook.   You don't have to use Apple Mail again after that. So, while you're technically still adding an account to Mail, you don't have to use it, or you can remove it after you've set the default to Outlook.  strongEDIT/strong  I just wanted to add that in some cases, certain Apple software (e.g. Photos) have their own settings for which email client to use when sharing content. So you will need to select Outlook as the default within these Apps as well if you want to share content via email.  <answer261939> The simplest way to do this - which doesn't involve messing with Mail itself - is the old faithful RCDefaultAppbr Yes it's ancient; yes it still works; yes it's free.  It installs as a control panel from where you can set defaults for just about anything on the machine... including Mail.  Simply select from a drop menu  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rur78.png" alt="enter image description here"  If you want to have a poke at the other sections, note it can take some time to build the apps/services list; don't think it's hung, it's just thinking ;-)  <answer285364> Sometimes, even after setting Outlook as default mail client in Apple Mail - with an account you remove afterwards - (how could Apple ever think this is a good place to stick this setting) it does not stick.  Just to be sure, after setting the pref in Mail, run this through Terminal:  precode/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/\   LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -kill -r -all local,system,user /code/pre  <comment327970> While not a good solution, I did find this: http://osxdaily.com/2014/05/06/change-default-mail-app-mac/#comment-745047. You just make up a fake account and try until it finally gives up. Even after this I found that the mail app would sometimes revert back to Mail... <comment327987> This doesn't answer the question since it requires adding an account. What I would like to know is where the internal setting is in OSX to get control over this without the requirement of adding an account. BTW, my comment explains how to do the same thing without needing a "real" account. <comment327990> Ah, I didn't pick up on your comment while adding my answer. For future reference it's better to edit your question to provide additional context, rather than adding a comment. I do realise you asked how to change the default _without adding an account to the mail client_, hence my answer stating you didn't have to use Mail afterwards (or even keep the account in it) after changing the default. Now that I've read your comment, is the reason you're asking this because you're having trouble making sure the change 'sticks' by using this option? If so there is a potential fix for this.
