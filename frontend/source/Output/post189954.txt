Mac OSX installer is disabled or not accessable <body> I have a persistent problem where my installer is not associated with pkg files. My installer is showing that is not available (See screenshots)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JzXqt.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZAzi9.png" alt="enter image description here"  In the past I have had to re-associate my pkg files with the installer but now I can't because it is hidden  <answer190095> I re-installed Yosemite and now it is fine. The date of the installer went back to Sept. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vxlsD.png" alt="enter image description here"
