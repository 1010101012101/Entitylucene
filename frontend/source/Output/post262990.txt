Ping `hostname` stuck about 5 seconds on macOS Sierra <body> I will describe this problem details in shell interaction records:  precode$ host `hostname` Host myhost.local not found: 3(NXDOMAIN)  $ cat /etc/hosts | grep 127.0.0.1 127.0.0.1 localhost myhost.local  $ ping `hostname` # stuck about 5 seconds (maybe a DNS query timeout) PING localhost (127.0.0.1): 56 data bytes 64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.108 ms 64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.028 ms /code/pre  <comment329469> This problem did have some side effects: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37971955/slow-logback-start-up-times <comment329470> do you get the same behaviour when you do `ping localhost` <comment329472> @Deesbek ping localhost has no delay on my machine <comment329474> interesting. Any reason why you are running `hostname`. I get the exact same output to all the same commands as you or at least could do had I set my hostname to myhost.local.  I would try setting your domain to a resolvable domain.  In any case I cannot replicate your delay.
