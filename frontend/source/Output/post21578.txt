Temporarily disable autocorrect (in Lion) <body> Occasionally, when chatting, it is fun to deliberately misspell words, dyaknowadImean?  OS X Lion is autocorrecting my misspellings into completely random words! Does anyone know how I can temporarily, (e.g. by holding down a key as i type the deliberately misspelled word?) disable autocorrect?  <answer21583> Go to codeSystem Preferences/code, Keyboard, Shortcuts. Add a shortcut for All Applications. Give it the keystroke you like. The name should be: "Correct Spelling Automatically".  <comment23728> I like the way you are thinking - I'll try this... <comment23729> It wrks!!!! :-) <comment23730> PS There is no need to restart - the keyboard shortcut is activated without a restart. <comment23756> Nice. For people who prefer the mouse, an AppleScript might work. Just a thought.
