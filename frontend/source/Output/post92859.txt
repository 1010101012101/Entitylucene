Ethernet indicator in OSX menu bar <body> I am using OSX 10.7  When I move between different ethernet networks (e.g., at work using ethernet on an external display, at home using thunderbolt ethernet), the ethernet does not always connect. However, I don't get immediate feedback. Instead, I connect to wi-fi. However, wi-fi is both slower and less reliable than ethernet. Thus, I'd like to know whether I am connected to ethernet or not. Of course I can go into preferences and network settings to see whether I'm connected to ethernet, but it would be better if there was some form of indicator in the status bar, just as there is for wi-fi. Thus, my question:  strongIs there a way of getting an indicator of ethernet connectivity in the OSX menu-bar?/strong  Perhaps there is a free application that can do this.  <answer92860> I just installed menumeters. If you go into the preferences for MenuMeters it is possible to add a network icon to the OSX menu bar. Clicking on the icon, indicates the current network (i.e., wifi or Ethernet).  This is a reasonable solution, but it still requires you to click on the icon to see whether ethernet is connected.  <answer126849> There is an app on Mac App Store that does exactly that: Ethernet Status  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Kpv1X.jpg" alt="MAS Screenshot"  It also shows status of Thunderbolt network adaptors. Sadly it is not free.  <answer272620> Late to answer but still for those landing here looking for a Ethernet connectivity status icon in menu bar, check this macOS app Ethernet Status - The Missing LAN Status Bar Icon. It shows ethernet interface, IP Address and if interface is active via changing menu bar icon.

The problem is it seems you have both wifi and ethernet enabled. So any app you use may not be able to distinguish which one is actually being used if both are connected. And will/should show both connected <comment108932> @markhunte in the `system preferences - network` there is the thing called "service order"; I think the service order tells OSX which network to use when connected for example to both wi-fi and ethernet. I would have thought that an app could use that information. <comment108933> Thanks I know about the order of service but I have my doubts about the order being honoured in all cases. <comment181026> Please mark this answer. It fixes the problem for me and I hope it does for you too. :P <comment284017> But does it differentiate between Ethernet and Wi-Fi, as was requested? I feel like it doesn't. <comment331904> Unfortunately menumeters no more works on OSX El Capitan as per the notice on their website.
