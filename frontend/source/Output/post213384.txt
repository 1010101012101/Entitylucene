How do you force spaces preview to always use a picture in El Capitan? <body> Since upgrading to El Capitan my spaces previews sometimes are text only, and sometimes are full image previews. It seems to be related to whether or not I initiate Mission Control on a space that is fullscreened or not.   Is there a way to force spaces to always use a preview picture?

Hope this helps!  <comment257622> The area auto expands when you mouse over it.  There may be a terminal command to set it permanently. <comment257636> That works by mousing over the text versions, but changes mouse position and requires an extra application. Thanks for the well documented suggestion, but more intrusive for me than the text-only spaces.
