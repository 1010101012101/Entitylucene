What is a "stuck" process? <body> Using the strongtop/strong command in Terminal, and ordering the list by state, I see a number of processes on Yosemite 10.10.1 whose state is strongstuck/strong. I've looked through strongman ps/strong and strongman top/strong for an explanation, and done some googling, without enlightenment.  Nothing's apparently wrong with the system - in fact, coreaudiod (one of the stuck processes) is racking up CPU and merrily driving the sound system - but I'm curious what is "stuck" about them and whether this is cause for concern.      precodeProcesses: 198 total, 2 running, 5 stuck, 191 sleeping, 747 threads                                                                          21:42:18 Load Avg: 1.23, 1.21, 1.17  CPU usage: 0.72% user, 1.44% sys, 97.83% idle  SharedLibs: 15M resident, 15M data, 0B linkedit.
