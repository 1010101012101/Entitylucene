Reset Security Questions <body> I have forgotten my Apple ID's security questions. How do I reset them? I have tried searching the web, and could not find a way to reset it.  <answer179374> In order to reset your security questions, you need to be able to log into your Apple ID first.  ol liGo to My Apple ID, as Apple calls it./li liHit "Manage your Apple ID" and sign in./li liGo to Password and Security./li liClick “Send reset security info email to [rescue email address].”/li /ol  If you don't have a rescue address, or you can't sign in, contact Apple. From a quick Google search, they will ask you to generate a temporary support code if you can log in. If you have a credit card added to the account, they will ask you for verification.  em(strongNote/strong: I haven't tried this myself. What Apple Support will ask you to do depends.)/em  <comment212582> How would Apple be able to tell the difference between you looking for this information and someone trying to steal your id? <comment212700> Could you explain the situation when one would be asked the security question? is it only in the cases when you do not know the AppleID ? <comment212702> @Buscar웃 You may get the security questions when you haven't logged into your Apple ID for a while, or you are logging into your Apple ID from a new computer. Otherwise, it seems it asks you them at random times.
