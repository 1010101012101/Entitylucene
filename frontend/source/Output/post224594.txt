how to delay the login items to start <body> I use a program to deal with the contents in sd card on startup. But the problem is that the program always starts before I can see the sd card in the finder.  As a result, the program can't find the contents and can't run correctly. I think whether I can delay the startup time of a specified program in codelogin items preference/code.  <answer224597> Make a simple bash script, that starts on startup instead:  precode#!/bin/bash #Wait for however long you want: sleep &lt;num of seconds&gt; #Use the following if the program is a .app: open -a /path/to/app/myApp.app #Use the following if the program is an executable (not a .app): /path/to/exec/theExec /code/pre  Now, save the file to your documents folder as startupScript.bash.   Note: If you use textedit to create the file, hold down kbd shift /kbd + kbd command /kbd + kbd T /kbd before saving it.  Open up "Terminal". Type:  codechmod +x ~/Documents/startupScript.bash/code  Then open up System Preferences, and add the script to the login items tab.
