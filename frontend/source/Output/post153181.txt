iPhone 5 all outgoing calls fail <body> I have an iPhone 5 which I purchased (from India) in Nov 2012 and now it is out of warranty. I found an old SIM Card, which I purchased from Singapore when I was visiting that country, and put it inside my phone just to check if it still works or not.  I asked my friends to call me on that number, they could hear the phone ringing tone but my phone was not ringing so after that I switched back to my local SIM which was working before. Now I am unable to make any calls from my number, all outgoing calls fail immediately with a "Call Failed" message and I can hear 2 beeps. I can receive Incoming calls, send and receive texts and can browse the internet using 3G data connection on the same SIM.  I tried the my local SIM in other phone and it works perfectly fine which confirms that there's no issue with the service provider. I Tried some other local SIM in my iPhone 5, that doesn't work either.  This is definitely some issue with my iPhone 5. What could the issue be? I am really worried because it is out of warranty now.  <answer153369> I tried  codeSettings -&gt; General -&gt; Date &amp; Time -&gt; Set Automatically Turn it OFF/code  I set the Time Zone manually to the local time zone and set the time back to when I bout the phone in November 2012. After that I just changed the time to the current time.  After that I found out the Location Privacy Setting for updating the time zone was disabled in the codeSettings -&gt; Privacy -&gt; Location Services -&gt; System Services -&gt; Setting Time Zone/code. This must have happened when I switched my SIM Card. I turned it on and now IT'S WORKING  :D  <answer167515> Another solution I found to this problem:  Open codeSettings -&gt; Phone -&gt; Show Caller ID/code  It'll take some seconds to load the and show a loading indicator, after that is done the phone will be able to make and receive calls  <answer214432> I found that the problem for call failed on my iPhone 6 was the bad date &amp; time settings. My location-based timezone was not enabled, and the phone time was incorrect. I disabled the auto time &amp; date, reinserted the sim card and BOOM!  I got the dots. It works.

The caller ID and *#31# are temporary fixes, the phone restarts and it again does the same behaviour
