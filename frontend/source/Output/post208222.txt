Unexpected Finder message "This item will be deleted immediately" <body> I made a second user account (codetest/code, admin privs) and set the permissions of my second hard drive so that this account could read &amp; write. The only thing I changed was the first line and then applying the setting to all enclosed folders.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aGOYd.png" alt="enter image description here"  Strange things happen.  ol liMy own user account is not allowed to write to the disk anymore. As I only added permissions, this seems nonsensical to me./li liWhen attempting to move an item from that disk to the trash from my own account (not the codetest/code account), Finder gives me the message /li /ol     This item will be deleted immediately.   Which I had never seen before.  Can somebody explain this?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Hfub1.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment251157> Which groups contain your user? The only users so far which can write to disk are test, system and all members of wheel? <comment251598> @klanomath How can I find out which groups I belong to? <comment251601> `groups user_name` or `id user_name` should work <comment251609> This prints `staff com.apple.sharepoint.group.1 everyone localaccounts _appserverusr admin _appserveradm _lpadmin _appstore _lpoperator _developer com.apple.access_ftp com.apple.access_screensharing com.apple.access_ssh`. I find it strange that even when I set `read-write` for `everyone` or for my user explicitly, I still have the problem.
