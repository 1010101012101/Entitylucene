How can I map the "Eject" key on a Microsoft keyboard or create a new shortcut for locking my screen? <body> I like using codeControl + Shift + Eject/code to lock my screen quickly. The codeEject/code key does not exist on my Microsoft keyboard, and there does not seem to be easy way to do map another key to that key through System Preferences.  ul liHow can I map a key on my Microsoft keyboard to the codeEject/code key?/li liOtherwise, how do I create a new shortcut for locking my screen?/li /ul  <answer190149> The eject key unfortunately does not have a key code, so either they keyboard supports it or it doesn't, and you have to make a workaround. You can create a new shortcut by following these steps:  ol liOpen Automater and create a Service with a single "Run AppleScript" action, containing the following code:  precodetell application "Finder" to sleep /code/pre  Make sure the Service is set to receive "no input", and work in "any application". Save it with a name of your choosing./li liGo into Keyboard preferences, click on the Shortcuts tab, and click on Services. The newly created service should be near the bottom. Click on the service, then click on "add shortcut", and specify a shortcut to your liking./li liYou may have to give Automator access by adding it to the list of applications in Accessibility under the Privacy tab in Security and Privacy./li /ol  That's it! Now you can use that shortcut from anywhere to sleep your Mac.  <answer190151> I don't know how to map a key to the Eject key, but you can easily create a new shortcut with Automator and Services:  ol liOpen Automator in the Applications folder./li liChoose Service:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mmEWN.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liSelect Utilities and drag Run AppleScript to the right pane:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qIlVF.png" alt="enter image description here"  Configure, on the top right corner, that the service should receive no input in any application. Then paste this AppleScript script:  precodeon run {input, parameters}     do shell script "open /System/Library/Frameworks/ScreenSaver.framework/Versions/A/Resources/ScreenSaverEngine.app" end run /code/pre/li liSave the service. Use a descriptive name, as it is the name that will appear in the Services menu. You can see in the screenshot above that I named the service emLock Screen/em./li liOpen System Preferences, select Keyboard and then the Shortcuts tab. Under General locate emLock Screen/em and assign a key shortcut to it. As you can see, I chose kbdControl/kbdkbdCommand/kbdkbdL/kbd:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yYPjV.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liThe emLock Screen/em service is now accessible from any application as an entry in the Services menu:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xnyQw.png" alt="enter image description here"/li /ol  Choose the service shortcut carefully to avoid conflicts with other applications' shortcuts.  <comment225704> +1 Didn't know I could put my screen to sleep with Control + Shift + Eject. <comment359656> I don't see the Lock Screen in services menu although i have checked it in keyboard shortcut.
