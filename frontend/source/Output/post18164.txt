"Macintosh HD" no longer shows up in Finder on Lion <body> How do I get to the Macintosh HD, or the root folder, from Finder in Lion? It no longer appears in the favorites section.  I know I can open it from Terminal, but I want to do it in Finder easily like I could in 10.6.  <answer18166> Disks have been removed from the Finder sidebar by default, however you can easily reenable these.  In Finder go to File  Preferences and then to the Sidebar tab.  There you can choose what gets displayed in your sidebar.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rtncU.png" alt="Finder Preferences"  <answer18169> kbdShift/kbd-kbdCmd/kbd-kbdC/kbd is how I do it.  You can also use the "Go" menu in Finder and choose the "Computer" option.  <comment19823> Yes, but Macintosh HD isn't in that list. <comment19824> It's included under Hard disks in the devices section. You can then Command + Drag the Macintosh HD from Devices to Favorites in the Finder window if you would like after turning Hard disks on. <comment19825> Ahhh, thanks a lot!
