Can't erase SSD on main bay <body> I have a MacBook Pro mid 2011. I've installed a SSD on the main bay, removed the optical drive and installed a caddy with the a regular HDD on it. The OS was installed on the SSD. This setup works fine!  Last week I had to force a shut down by pressing and holding the power button. After that, my system didn't boot. (a question mark apperars)  I install El Capitan again on my HDD and right now I'm trying to format/erase/restart my SSD.  If I change hard drives places (putting SSD in the caddy and HD on main bay) it works… I can erase the SSD, reformat, etc, using Disk Utility.  But with the HDD on caddy and the SSD on the main bay, my mac dont recognize my SDD and I can't erase, or format it.  My goal here is to reinstall El Capitan on SSD using it on the main bay because its faster and have a better performance.  Does anybody have an idea about it?  <answer218632> First, make sure it's not just a regular connectivity problem. I used to have an older MBP that displayed the same symptoms every now and then (with the stock HDD). Whenever it threw question-marks or missing file-system symbols at boot-time; I'd just pop it out, blow it like an old Nintendo cartridge, and pop it back in.
