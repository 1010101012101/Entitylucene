Change the permission of multiple files using the GUI <body> I am looking for a way to change the permission of multiple files using the GUI. I tried to select all the files and hit show info in the right click context menu, but this opens multiple dialogs where I have to enter my admin password and then change the permission.   Is there an easier way to accomplish this task?  <answer12803> Checkout BatChmod a free utility for changing file permissions. You can select a folder that contains the files youâ€™re interested in, make the changes and apply those changes to all of the files in the folder.  <answer12804> The Finder isnt able to natively change permissions of multiple selected files.  There is a 3rd party file manager application called Folklift2 which does have the ability to do this (amongst other things).  It's $29.95, but probably worth every cent if you need to do this often.  If you want instructions on how to do this via the command line for free, let me know in the comments :)  strong[Edit: I was wrong, it is possible - see answer from @Nilloc]/strong  <answer12839> You emcan/em use Finder to change multiple files permissions. kbdCommand/kbd+kbdOption/kbd+kbdi/kbd will open the emMultiple Item Info/em panel that should set the permissions for all files that have been selected (it also gives you total file size, and lets set label colors too).  Otherwise you can select the folder the files you want to change are in, and use the regular get info window to set permissions on all containing files.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iy3lJ.png" alt="Appling permissions to enclosed items..."  <comment13448> Yes please let me know the command line way.. also can we make shell script like of file on mac (like we do on linux) so I can run it easily. Thanks :) <comment13482> On my tests the permissions box was greyed out so I assumed it was not accessible, but even with the permission items greyed out they are still active and able to be changed.  Nice answer :) <comment13484> Thanks Man!! you are super!!! BTW: you look like a movie hero!
