How do you enter binary numbers in OS X Calculator? <body> I'm using Calculator on Mac OS X 10.7.5.  I switched it to the "Programmer" view, and the upper right only has "8", "10", and "16" buttons, which means it only allows you to enter octal, decimal, and hexadecimal numbers.  How can I enter binary numbers?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CAGul.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer163595> Click "show binary" button, this shows in your screenshot, and then you can click the "bit" you want to set.  <comment191587> Thanks, that is a really bizarre way of doing it (what the heck was Apple thinking?).  You also can't paste a binary number into Calculator that way, so I wonder if there's an easier way to enter binary numbers. <comment191589> If your dead pressed on using apples native calculator its not that easy. There are better web alternatives or even use terminal if you feel like it. But theres only so much you can do with that calculator.
