Faulty plug burnt Apple lightning cable <body> I have been charging my phone for a few days now from a plug,  which I wasn't aware of being faulty. When connecting devices to the electrical network it made static noises and after I unplugged my USB cable from the charger I saw it had marks as if it had been burnt. It must have been releasing a lot of heat  while charging. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Q202E.jpg" alt="image1"  Is it safe to use that charger and plug in the future?  <comment308994> I very much doubt it. <comment308996> Thank you for the quick response, I guess I'll have to throw them away. <comment309011> If you have a bad wall plug, i.e. duplex receptacle, then it should be properly replaced before continued use. As to any damage done to the charger and or cable I can't possibly accurately comment without proper testing with, e.g. multi-meter, however the charger and lighting to USB cable are ~$20 USD each. Without testing I'd opt for a new charger but use the existing cable after cleaning it off. Although if you want to be totally safe, replace all three.  BTW The replacement of the  duplex receptacle is not necessarily a do-it-yourself project, unless you truly know what you're doing! <comment309012> What values should I test with a multi- meter in order to know whether it's usable? <comment309108> @John With a multimeter, you should use the continuity option and try from pins on one end of the cable to another. Make sure you don't get false readings by touching the case. <comment309173> @Bradman175, While testing continuity should be done nonetheless just having continuity doesn't mean it's safe to use. <comment309176> @John, As an example, on my USB Power Adapter it's rated output is 5V 1A and if it is not outputting higher then its rated output then I'd probably continue to use it. That's assuming it isn't also physically damaged, i.e. loose contacts, loose plug blades or melted case, etc. This link shows where the power ratings labels are on the various USB Power Adapters that Apple  manufactures: [About Apple USB Power Adapters](http://www.apple.com/power-adapters/)
