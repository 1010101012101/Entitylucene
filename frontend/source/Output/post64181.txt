publishing similar apps on apple store <body> I am an indiviual developer (I also have a company too).  Some of our clients want to publish apps that can support their business. We have created a template app for one of the customers, and for others I have had the idea to change the look, appearance and a few bit features for each and publish them on the App Store.  The problem is, will Apple allow to publish similar apps? If not how can I do that?  <comment75306> Ask Different is not the place to ask developer questions. Perhaps you would like to post your question at Stack Overflow. <comment75307> @duci9y I disagree. SO is for programming issues, and there is none in my opinion here. The OP wants to know more about the Apple ecosystem, which fits perfectly here I believe. <comment75308> But the question is about the Developer Program, and information about that is under NDA. But yeah, it doesnâ€™t belong on SO, it belongs on the Developer Forums at Apple. <comment244766> Hi there, what happened to this? Did you manage to pass the apple's strict review process for your similar looking apps ?
