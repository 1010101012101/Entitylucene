Can I have different virtual desktops with different resolutions/scaling? <body> I'm really frustrated by the way some applications are not HiDPI aware and resort to pixel doubling - video games, GIMP, etc.  Is it possible to have one of my virtual desktops (I think apple uses a different term? "Workspaces"?) be at the native resolution (ie "scaled" to "more space") while the other remain at "best for this display"?  I've done a tonne of searching and I can't find anything, but maybe it's just hurt by the fact I don't know the apple jargon.  I'd be happy with something like windows has that allows me to turn off DPI scaling for specific applications.   I have a 2014 Macbook Pro 15" retina with a 2880x1800 resolution.  Thank you for any help :)   <answer193270> No, each Desktop (Space) will have the same resolution, whatever the Display's resolution is set at.  You could use an App like Display Menu to more easily/quickly change the resolution as needed/wanted as you change between Desktops.  <comment230497> Thank you for your answer. I'm not keen to hot-swap resolutions since I don't like all the apps shifting around; I'd rather stick with the current crappy pixel doubling.  Edit: I'll mark your answer as The Answer after a few more days of vain hope that someone has another suggestion.
