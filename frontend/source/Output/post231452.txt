The volume customer keys of my Mac don't work anymore <body> I used to press F10 to mute, F11 to decrease volume and F12 to increase volume, but all of them suddenly stopped working. If I press any of those keys now, they send me to another screen that has nothing to do with the sound volume.    How can I fix them?  <answer267208> Try this so the keys can work as before again, without needing a volume slider https://youtu.be/rqYmBCxGLD4   <comment282657> try Fn+F10, Fn+F11 etc... <comment282658> I fixed, I want to sharing the information for anyone who is having same problem with its mac volume.To change your computer’s volume, click the Volume control Volume slider in the menu bar, then drag the slider to adjust the volume.  If the Volume control isn’t in the menu bar, choose Apple menu  System Preferences, then click Sound. Click Output, then select the “Show volume in menu bar” checkbox. <comment338196> Answers on Ask Different need to be more than just a link. It's okay to include a link, but please summarize or excerpt it in the answer. The idea is to make the answer stand alone.
