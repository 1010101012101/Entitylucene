How can I add a .pkpass file to Wallet? <body> I have a .pkpass file which contains the boarding card for my next flight. Can I add it to iOS Wallet or is it not possible to add a .pkpass file? In case it is possible, how can I do it?  I am using iOS 9.2.1 in an iPhone 4S  <answer285064> If you have Wallet on your iPhone open up the boarding pass provided from airline. At the top right hand corner of phone shows Add - tap this and it should automatically add to your Wallet. Have just done this with Boarding Passes received from Thomson. Hope this works for you.  <comment370511> You could probably use iExplorer to find the place where your pkpasses are stored, then drop the file in that folder...
