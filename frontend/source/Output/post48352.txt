Is there an easy to use Bible program for both OS X and iOS? <body> Is there an easy to use Bible program, preferably with dictionary, concordance as well as text for maybe more than 1 translation.  My PC has PC Study Bible and it's great but I've grown to hate Parallels.  Tried Macsword and bombed out, too complicated for me.  <answer48353> h2Logos Bible Software/h2  For both Mac and iOS, as well as Windows, Android, and web based. It has several different versions, some are paid, and some free. It allows you to search within a Bible. Other features include Bible words studies, passage guides, highlighting, and reading plans  iOS App Store Link (iPad, iPhone, and iPod touch compatible) img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/N7p2u.jpg" alt="Logos bible on iOS"br Logos for Macbr img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BGH5p.png" alt="Logos for Mca"  <answer48355> h2Top Choices for Mac Bible Software/h2  There are many Bible programs for the Mac.  hr  ul liLogos Bible software  Fairly easy to use but also somewhat expensive. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Lx0CE.png" alt="Logos Bible Software"/li /ul  hr  ul liAccordance  I have heard that this is the best and most powerful of them, and there is a free version. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/THdzG.jpg" alt="Accordance Bible Software"/li /ul  hr  ul liOliveTree This is what I use (mostly on my iPad) and I love it. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4tC7y.jpg" alt="Olive Tree for Mac"/li /ul  You can find other links to software here.  <answer48359> If you're looking for synchronization between devices as a key feature, then you could consider using a Kindle bible. Then you've got a web interface, iPad, and iPhone interface that synchronizes your personal notes and highlights. It unfortunately won't have a lot of the other features you're looking for.  <answer48363> This is the ridiculously simple answer, but I don't use a special bible reader program; I use built-in operating system features and a high quality text editor.  I constructed a text file called codeBible.txt/code that I open in TextWrangler. The editor's search features function well as a concordance, and for multiple translations, I open additional text files in additional windows. Thanks to the wonders of Unicode, it even works for Hebrew and Greek versions.  I have chapter breaks set up with hard code\n/code characters, and verses separated simply by verse numbers, so each line is a chapter.  It doesn't have a embible/em dictionary, but three-finger tap on my trackpad brings up the Mac OS X Dictionary, which includes Wikipedia pages that are quite helpful about names of people, places, events, etc.  On the iOS side, I use iBooks. Not as full-featured as the Mac side, but I mostly read there, and don't do a whole lot of active sermon writing on my iPod Touch.  <answer83182> I like Blue Letter Bible (Mac/OSX).  Different versions for side x side comparison.  Great iPhone and and iPad Apps.  Has great commentaries (written and Audio).  The Apps is where I believe it does the best job. It's free, donations are accepted.
