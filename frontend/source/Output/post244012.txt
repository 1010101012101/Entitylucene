Shared directory with Guest Ubuntu has become empty: a problem of virtualbox guest addition? <body> I installed Ubuntu under Virtualbox in MacBook Pro with OS X El Capitan.  To share my OS X home directory code/Users/tli/code folder with the guest Ubuntu, I downloaded the Virtualbox Guest Addition iso file to code/Users/tli/Downloads/virtualbox/VBoxGuestAdditions_5.0.16.iso/code, specified it under the virtual machine's Settings - Storage - Optical Drive (see the screenshot below), and installed it under the guest Ubuntu.  Then the shared directory worked: my OS X home directory code/Users/tli/code folder is mounted as code/media/sf_tli/code, and I could access the content in my OS X home directory from guest Ubuntu.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/egVfO.png" alt="enter image description here"  But after restarting the guest Ubuntu and virtualbox maybe abnormally or maybe not (I forgot), the content of the shared directory became empty in the guest Ubuntu. To solve the problem, I tried to reinstall the Guest Addition, by clicking Devices - Insert Guest Addition CD Image, but got the following error:     Unable to insert the virtual optical disk   /Applications/VirtualBox.app/Contents/MacOS/VBoxGuestAdditions.iso   into the machine Ubuntu14.04.       Would you like to try to force insertion of this disk?      Details:      Could not mount the media/drive   '/Applications/VirtualBox.app/Contents/MacOS/VBoxGuestAdditions.iso'   (VERR_PDM_MEDIA_LOCKED).      Result Code:  NS_ERROR_FAILURE (0x80004005) Component:  ConsoleWrap   Interface:  IConsole {872da645-4a9b-1727-bee2-5585105b9eed} Callee:    IMachine {f30138d4-e5ea-4b3a-8858-a059de4c93fd}   Also see the following screenshot:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QnWCo.png" alt="enter image description here"  I feel it strange to look for the Guest Addition under code/Applications/VirtualBox.app/Contents/MacOS/VBoxGuestAdditions.iso/code of my OS X, rather than code/Users/tli/Downloads/virtualbox/VBoxGuestAdditions_5.0.16.iso/code which I specified earlier.   By the way, my user account under the guest Ubuntu is a member of group codevboxsf/code.  What shall I do to make the shared directory work under the Guest Ubuntu?  Thanks.  <answer244015> Just solved the shared directory problem (showing the content of the shared directory), by installing the guest addition under gnome terminal of the guest Ubuntu:  precodecd /media/t/VBOXADDITIONS_5.0.16_105871/  sudo ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run  /code/pre  See "Installing Guest Additions from a Terminal"  in https://askubuntu.com/a/22745/1471.  Questions:  ol liWhy did the above command line solution succeed in showing the content of the shared directory./li liWhat is the cause of my problem in my post here? I still get the same error when clicking Devices - Insert Guest Addition CD Image as in my post here./li /ol
