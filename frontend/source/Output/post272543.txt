How to switch between two Macs and one Thunderbolt Display? <body> I have 2 MacBook Pros and one Thunderbolt Display (27 inch). Both MBPs support Thunderbolt connectivity and work fine with external display. I need a way to switch between 2 MBP, without changing the connection everytime.   Is there any hardware / KVM switch which supports this functionality?   MBP Models are as below:  ul liMacBook Pro (13-inch Mid 2012)/li liMacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013)/li /ul  <answer272545> I do know of a Thunderbolt 2 Dock and KVM (Keyboard Video Mouse) device that will allow you to do just this - IOGEAR Thunderbolt 2 KVM, Docking Station, GTD732  There are two key bullet points that address your specific situation:     ul   liShare your peripherals and Thunderbolt 2 devices between 2 computers/li   liSupports 4K (UHD) resolution. Supports Dual displays with HDMI and Thunderbolt 2 monitors/li   /ul   Unfortunately, I don't know of any Thunderbolt 1 Dock/KVM's. (The MBP 2012 and TB Display are both TB1)  Thunderbolt 2 is backward compatible with Thunderbolt 1 (the main difference being bandwidth)  so in theory, it should work just fine especially since you are connecting just one TB display.  The other major downside is that it's extremely expensive.  For the $320 USD for this device, I personally would go through the pain of switching cables or (what I would most likely do) get a display with multiple inputs.  <comment342537> Your link doesn't seem to be working. <comment342538> @Chillie...
