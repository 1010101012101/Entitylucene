How To Sandbox Individual Applications On OS X Mavericks <body> I am trying to Sandbox Firefox on OS X.  I know on Linux, you have AppArmor.  On Windows, you Sandboxie.  Is there something built into OS X that will allow me to Sandbox individual applications?  <answer132328> Yes, Apple included a sandbox facility with the release of Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard in 2006. This facility includes sandbox, sandboxd, sandbox_init, and sandbox-exec.  <comment146248> Could you define what you mean by "sandbox"?
