Difference between unlocked iPhone 6 from T-Mobile vs. regular unlocked iPhone 6? <body> I'm trying to understand what is the difference between buying an unlocked iPhone 6 with T-Mobile SIM versus just a regular unlocked iPhone 6? They seem to be the same price: http://store.apple.com/us/buy-iphone/iphone6/4.7-inch-display-64gb-silver  Apple's info page states this:     Purchasing an unlocked iPhone means you will not qualify for the lower   iPhone price associated with a contract or a carrier installment plan.   The unlocked iPhone 6 model is A1586. The unlocked iPhone 6 Plus model   is A1524. The T-Mobile iPhone 6 model is A1549. The T-Mobile iPhone 6   Plus model is A1522. For details on LTE network support, please see   www.apple.com/iphone/LTE.   Can someone translate it?  <answer193177> There are a few different standards for cellular communication in America, so there's an iPhone to account for each one of those.  iPhone 6 (GSM/North America)  A1549  iPhone 6 (CDMA/Verizon)  A1549  iPhone 6 (Global/Sprint)  A1586  iPhone 6 (China Mobile)  A1589  Source and more details: everymac.com  <answer202813> If you look closely at http://www.apple.com/iphone/LTE/, the SIM-Free unlocked models (A1586, A1524) supports ALL of the LTE bands of the T-Mobile unlocked phones (A1549,A1522), PLUS some additional networks.  Here is the exact verbiage on the page (easy to overlook): "Models A1586 and A1524 strongalso support/strong LTE networks listed for models A1549 and A1522." which basically means "same as the T-Mobile phone ... and then some..."  I picked up a 6 and 6plus sim-free earlier this year to be used on our mobile share value AT&amp;T plan in the US; the Apple Store employee essentially pushed me out the door with the SIM-free model. Said it had additional bands, potentially better resale value, etc...  Hope this helps clear it up.
