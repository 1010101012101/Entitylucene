How to keep messages after deactivating imessage? <body> I disabled imesseage (and removed the addresses) on my iphone 4. Afterwards, some old messages to some friends disappeared from my phone. I don't understand why.  I restored imessage and the addresses, and now the old messages are back. How can I disable imessage without losing the messages?  <answer151223> In the morning, reactivating imessage, adding back the numbers, then disabling it strongremoving the numbers/strong, fixed it. I still have all my old messages.
