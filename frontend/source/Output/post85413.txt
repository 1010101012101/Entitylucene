Import Google Reader subscriptions into Flipboard <body> Is there a simple way to import my rss subscriptions from Google Reader(GR) into Flipboard(F). I know i can read the subscriptions in F, but want to really import them into F so i can access it in F after GR will shutdown.  <answer85418> Yes there is and it is described in an article on the Flipboard web page: "Weâ€™ve Got Your RSS Covered! Save Your Google Reader Feeds Now".   Basically you just have to choose emGoogle Reader/em in the emAccounts/em tab. Once imported, Flipboard will fetch the feeds on its own. So it will also stay when Google has shut down Reader.  Just one more hint: If you want to save your feeds in a stand-alone file (e.g. for backing up) you could use Google Takeout.  <comment98748> What if I don't want to give them access to my account?
