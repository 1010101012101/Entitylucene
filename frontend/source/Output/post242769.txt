Macbook Air 13" 2013 won't power up reliably <body> I have a Macbook Air 13" 2013 that won't power up reliably. I spilled coffee on it a couple of weeks ago and that knocked it out of commission. I was able to get it to boot up a couple of times and everything else worked fine on it. I decided that the power button was probably the issue so I ordered an upper case to put in. I have that case on it now and I still can't get it to power up reliably. Every so often if I shake it correctly it will boot up and everything will work but hardly through the power button. Does the logic board need replaced? or maybe something else?  <comment298796> sounds like the coffee did some damage, have you opened up the mac to clean it? With distilled water or a cleaning solution? <comment299060> Yeah I removed all of the coffee and replaced the upper case which was affected by the coffee. <comment299154> And did you clean it with distilled water?
