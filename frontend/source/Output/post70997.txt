How do I delete attachments from mails I sent <body> In Mountain Lion’s Mail app, I can delete attachments from mails others have sent me, but not from the mails I sent to others.  In the mailbox, the messages I have sent are not marked with the small paperclip, even when then have a attachments (however, their size is correct and includes the big attachments). When I select an individual message (or many), the "Delete attachements" menu item is grayed out.  How can I deleted attachments from mails I sent?  <answer78871> Based on the page  http://lifehacker.com/5841097/how-to-delete-or-archive-attachments-in-apple-mail-and-free-up-disk-space I used the steps bellow.  ** Method recommended only for those who feel comfortable using the Terminal **  ul liopen the terminal app (Applications  Utilities  Terminal) /li lichange to the directory/folder with the emails typing in the terminal window  precode$ cd ~/Library/Mail/V2 /code/pre/li lilist the folders you have   precode$ ls /code/pre  or  precode$ ls -1 /code/pre/li liyou will obtain something like:  precode$ ls -1 IMAP-info@furia.com.br@pop.furia.com.br IMAP-infofuria@imap.gmail.com MailData Mailboxes /code/pre/li ligo to the folder of the account you want to clean, list the files and the result shows one or more mbox  precode$ cd IMAP-info@furia.com.br@pop.furia.com.br $ ls -1 INBOX.mbox /code/pre  or  precode$ ls -1 INBOX.mbox INBOX0.mbox INBOX1014.mbox /code/pre/li liif you have only one mbox, go to this folder, list it and you will see  precode$ cd INBOX.mbox $ ls CE7AE9-C83C-410A-9406-4DEFB7034 Archive.mbox Deleted Messages.mbox Drafts.mbox Info.plist Junk.mbox Sent Messages.mbox Trash.mbox /code/pre/li lichange to the folder of the messages sent (note the backslash before the space) and list to see the files  precode$ cd Sent\ Messages.mbox $ ls  CE7AE9-C83C-410A-9406-4DEFB7034 Info.plist /code/pre/li lithe first file is a folder and contains all the messages and attachments in a series of subfolders. Now you will use the powerful unix codefind/code command to find all the files to be deleted and delete them./li lithe codefind/code command can recursively descends the directory tree to search files by name and by size (among other options), so if you know that the attachmentes to be deleted are PDF files with more than 200k you can use the first command to find and list the files. Then if it's ok, delete them with the second command. The second example will find and delete zip files with more than 1 MB.  precode$ find . -iname "*.pdf" -size +200k ./77CE7AE9-C83C-410A-94/Data/Attachments/303/2/abc.pdf ./77CE7AE9-C83C-410A-94/Data/Attachments/305/2/xyz.pdf $ find . -iname "*.pdf" -size +200k -delete $ find . -iname "*.zip" -size +1M -delete /code/pre/li liand if you want to delete all attachments bellow the present folder, you can use one simple command. To confirm that you are at the correct folder verify first printing the working directory. Then, remove every Attachments folders bellow it.  precode$ pwd /Users/user/Library/Mail/v2/IMAP-info@furia.com.br@pop.furia.com.br/INBOX.mbox/Sent Messages.mbox $ find . -iname Attachments -exec rm -R {} + /code/pre/li lirepeat these operations on all mbox of the account/li /ul  <answer115844> This problem continues for some users (including me) in OS X 10.9.1 Mavericks with Mail.app v7.1 (1827).  Here's one work-around I found that worked for me, originally posted in an Apple Discussions thread. It may or may not work for everyone but it's safe and trivially easy to try. (A message with a "correctly recognized" attachment it generally one received from any outside source, as opposed to those in the Sent folder.)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kjaBI.jpg" alt="Apple Discussions Thread Screenshot"  Here's another work-around that I have not yet tried, but that may work for you:  Apple Discussions thread:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8ZC0D.jpg" alt="Apple Discussions Thread #2"  <comment82459> What do you mean? If the mail was sent, the attachment has already been delivered. So there's no point in deleting it... But maybe I just didn't understand the question <comment82461> @Abramodj when an email is stored in your inbox, you can suppress its attachments (it's in the Message menu) from your local copy… this helps keeping the size of mail archives down to something reasonable
