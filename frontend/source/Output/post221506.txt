Com.apple.finder.plist is missing and isn't being made automatically <body> My com.apple.finder.plist file is missing. I've looked in Library/Preferences and it isn't there, I already have hidden files and folders made visible, etc.  Whenever I restart my computer (by going up to AppleRestart, or by Restarting by an application installation, which is how I came across this problem) every application closes and files on the desktop disappear, however, the finder stops responding and I HAVE to end up force quitting my computer which screws up the installation of the program I've been trying to install (SideSync by Samsung, if that's relevant.)   I can only see the desktop background picture and the bar on the bottom. I can't open finder, I can't Relaunch it by going to the Force Quit Application window.  Running a mid 2012 MacBook Pro with recently installed Mavericks.  Any ideas?  <answer221552> The finder.plist isn't in code/Library/code, it's inbr code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist/codebr That would be why you couldn't find it.  Quick way to get there…br From Finderbr kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd N /kbd for New Windowbr kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd Shift ⇧ /kbd kbd G /kbd for Go To…br Copy/paste code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist/code including the tilde ~br Hit kbd Enter ⌅ /kbd   I'd also consider clearing the Saved Sate atbr code~/Library/Saved Application State/com.apple.finder.savedState/codebr It's safe to delete the entire folder contents - data, window etc.  <comment268198> I'd check for crash reports. You should find them in `/Users/YOURUSERNAME/Library/Application Support/CrashReporter/` and/or `/Users/YOURUSERNAME/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/`. Do the crashes only happen when you run the SideSync installer? Is your Mac stable until you try to restart? <comment268670> At the very beginning of my question I said I looked in Library/Preferences already. I ended up finding it in Users/MYNAME/Library/Preferences.  Thanks <comment268681> Which is exactly where I said! not /Library but ~/Library. ~/ is the standard Mac shortcut to save having to know the name of the boot drive & user. Had you copy/pasted the line as I said, it would have taken you straight there. <comment316731> I am having the same problem and I was able to get into preferences and the com.apple.finder.plist is not there. I also tired Cmd Shift G and it wasn't found and I tried Users/MyName and there isn't preferences or library. It worked fine until a couple weeks ago. I don't know what is going on. Any recommendations. <comment331587> I was confused about that for a second alo but I see now, the ~ makes all the difference. That helps me too, thanks.
