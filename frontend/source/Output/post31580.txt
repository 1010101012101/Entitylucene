Custom keyboard layout problem with some apps <body> I have an early 2011 Macbook Pro with Lion. I used Ukelele and KeyRemap4Macbook to customize my keyboard layout, because I wasn't satisfied with the default one.  Namely I switched right Cmd with right Option, Fn with left Ctrl and changed Eject to forward Delete.  Everything works as expected except two apps - Xcode and Textmate. When I work with these, my left Cmd and Option keys are also switched, which was not intended.  Any idea how to get this fixed?  <comment36199> Isn't the issue with the modifier keys specific to KeyRemap4MacBook and not Ukelele? You might ask its developer directly if no answers come up.
