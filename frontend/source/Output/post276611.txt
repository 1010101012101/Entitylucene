Apple Pages: Use a different header for odd an even pages <body> In Apple Pages, is it possible to use a different header for odd and even pages?  I have searched around and found this guide, but I think it's for the old version of Pages (as it is from 2006 and have the interfaces buttons mentioned don't exist).  There are also guides on how to use different headers for different sections, but that is different from odd and even pages.   <answer276624> This is currently not possible with Pages, as it was with Pages '09.  If you need this functionality, you can still use Pages '09 if you have it, but opening a document from Pages '09 with different headers for odd and even pages will cause such headers to be removed (and a warning thrown in Document Warnings).
