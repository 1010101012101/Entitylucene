How can use ssh to connect to my university network over VPN <body> I am still a beginner with using terminal. I am trying to ssh from my mac at home to a linux at my university. I am using VPN to connect to the network. When I ping the IP address of the computer I want to connect to it responds. I can connect when I am on campus, but not when I'm off. When I try codessh -v username@IP/code this is what I get:  precodedebug1: Reading configuration data /etc/ssh_config debug1: /etc/ssh_config line 20: Applying options for * debug1: Connecting to 10.36.0.250 [10.36.0.250] port 22. debug1: connect to address 10.36.0.250 port 22: Operation timed out ssh: connect to host 10.36.0.250 port 22: Operation timed out /code/pre  Running traceroute gives  precodetraceroute to 10.36.0.250 (10.36.0.250), 64 hops max, 52 byte packets  1  host141-129.vpnhosts.csulb.edu (134.139.141.129)  30.269 ms  29.085 ms  27.597 ms  2  * * *  3  * * *  4  * * *  5  * * *  6  * * * /code/pre  Any help would be much appreciated.  <answer176923> It turns out that I did I was being denied access, so I spoke to IT at school and got access. Thank you everyone for your help.  <comment204965> I would contact the IT support team of the university with this information, they might be in a better position to analyze this. <comment204967> Ok thanks for your help <comment204972> it looks like your University blocks many Ports. Maybe you have a wrong IP Adress, but you can't definitly not reach the 22 Port - also ICMP is turned off, so your traceroute will not work too. <comment204986> The IP address 10.x.x.x is a local address only ands so not accessable from the internet just your campus. Ask your system admin how to access off the campus
