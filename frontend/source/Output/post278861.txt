Cannot find Python.frameworks in OS Sierra <body> I am trying to find Python.framework under ~/Library/Frameworks but it's not there.  I need it to create a path from a software leading to my mac's Python including its bin and lib folders.  I only see Samsung Kies in my Frameworks folder.  Does anyone know why?  <answer278868> Open the Terminal.app.   Start the python interpreter by typing:  precodepython /code/pre  type the following:  precodeimport sys print(sys.path) /code/pre  to quit the interpreter type:  precodequit() /code/pre  <answer278887> The Python framework lives in the main System Library directory, not your home directory's Library. So, you'll find it here:  precode/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework /code/pre  <answer282264> Having similar problem with you. After some headache, I found that in macOS Sierra, the Python frameworks is located in  precode/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework /code/pre  Hope it helps
