How to protect an iPhone 4s from Internet access? <body> Is there a way to disable/lock the Wi-Fi network access on an iPhone 4S?  Crazy question, I know.  But I got my son an iPhone and do not want him to have an Internet access. I disabled his data through my account with Sprint.  But with Wi-Fi he can still get on the Internet when he is within reach of open hotspots (we do not have open Wi-Fi at home).  I want to be able to disable the Wi-Fi capabilities of his iPhone so that he cannot access the Internet. Any suggestions?  <answer112911> There isn't a way to do this directly on iOS. What you can do that is the closest thing to what you want to achieve is to follow these steps:   ul liGo to Settings  General  Restrictions  Enable Restrictions and create a passcode that only you will know (and it should be different from the passcode that has been set on your son's iPhone, if there is one)./li liThen deselect the following items: Safari, iTunes Store, iBookstore, Installing Apps, Deleting Apps, in-App Purchases, Siri, and FaceTime (of course, deselect whatever you see fit, but my example is an extreme example)./li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/W37Q6.png" alt="enter image description here"  ul liOn the same Restrictions menu, go to Accounts and tap "Don't Allow Changes"./li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ELRHG.png" alt="enter image description here"  ul liGo to Restrictions once again, and go to Cellular Data Use and tap "Don't Allow Changes"./li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tX8e9.png" alt="enter image description here"  ul liFinally, go back to Restrictions, scroll down to the bottom of the page, and tap the following switches under Game Center: "Multiplayer Games" and "Adding Friends."/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LFwve.png" alt="enter image description here"  I'm assuming that you don't want your son to use any form of Internet on the iPhone AT ALL. This will limit the iPhone to the most limited form as possible. I can't guarantee that your son will not be able to use the Internet in some way, shape, or form, but at least you have now severely limited the chances.  <comment228343> This question is worrying a lot of parents :(.
