What is the keyboard shortcut to focus this textfield in Xcode 4.1? <body> What is the keyboard shortcut to get focus inside the textbox pointed in the screenshot below?  I am new to Xcode 4.1. I use Eclipse a lot.   In Eclipse if we want to jump over any file we can use Command + Shift + R and we get a popup box and we can start typing filename and it shows suggestion, something similar to it I am looking in Xcode.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jRgHJ.png" alt="xcode 4.1 screen-shot"  <answer38231> Its filter Navigator..  And Its shortcut is Command+option+j  <comment43334> Questions about *using* Xcode are on topic here (development is not). This question is on topic. <comment201857> Command-Option-J seems to focus the textfield in the currently open pane of the left navigation. Could be Search, Debugger, etc. I'd like to see a shortcut that *always* focuses the "Filename Search" textfield.
