How do I check the download progress of Mountain Lion through the terminal? <body> I am downloading Mountain Lion, I know I can monitor download progress through the Mac App Store purchases screen but I want to know if I can monitor progress through Terminal.app using a shell command.  <answer57406> Sure - the storeagent uses a folder deep within /private/var/folders to hold the download progress.  On my Mac it's downloading to this folder below - yours may change, but you should be able to search for the com.apple.appstore using codemdfind/code and use codedu/code or codels/code to see the file size grow.  precode/private/var/folders/tv/xyw2rpln7hq4gw2m0prg_src0000gn/C/com.apple.appstore/497799835 /code/pre  The App Store has a nicer wrapper on the progress with a time estimate, but with codebc/code and other tools, you could do the same in a short shell script exercise.   hr  If you can't locate your folder, this codefind/code command might be of use to narrow down your search....  precodesudo find /var/folders -type d -name com.apple.appstore -print /code/pre  <answer57442> I decided that the best way to identify the file being downloaded was to write a small script that fetched the files held open by the App Store program codestoreagen/code.    precode#!/bin/bash appstore_pid=$(ps -ef|grep storeagen|grep -v grep|awk '{print $2}') lsof -p $appstore_pid|grep private|awk '{print $7 "\t" $9}' /code/pre  I set codeappstore_pid/code variable to the PID of codestoreagen/code by extracting it from the codeps/code command using codegrep/code and codeawk/code  Then I use codelsof/code to list open files by the PID of codestoreagen/code and I print out the size of the files and the files path.  If you do this several times in succession you can see the file(s) that's growing and make a good guess by its size that it is the OS download.    <answer57502> I just used the activity monitor and watched how much data transfer was happening... And ensure no other traffic at the time of download. Its not perfect, but gives you a general idea something is happening.  <comment65937> Could you expand your answer to explain how to find the right directory? <comment65939> Sure - I just did a brute force search based on last modified time and ls - but I'll edit in a `find` command that worked for me... <comment66003> I may have misunderstood the question but is it not much easier to just click on the Purchases "tab" in App Store and watch the progress bar? <comment66012> Nice use of lsof ;-) I piped to a second `grep` for pkg since I've seen the `lsof` return four or more items in /private/var/... <comment66028> `du -h /private/var/folders/*/*/C/com.apple.appstore/*/*.pkg` would print the size of the download in a human-readable format. The total size of the version I'm currently downloading is shown as 4.3 GB in App Store. <comment66213> I know you can do it in the Purchases tab.  I wanted to know if it could be done in the Terminal
