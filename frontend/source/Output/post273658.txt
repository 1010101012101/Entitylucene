External hd not found on macbook pro <body> Have an Early 2011 macbook pro that had a WD Passport external drive connected. It just stopped showing up in finder one day. It is now not appearing is disk utility or system report either. Initially I thought the drive had failed, but it works fine in both Windows and on my second Macbook Pro (Mid 2015). I tried reformatting it to HFS+, exFat, Fat32 and it still doesn't show up. The Windows PC and 2015 mac can see it with every format. With the 2011 macbook it's like it isn't connected, but light on the drive comes on and I can feel the drive spinning. Other drives and my iPhone work in the USB ports on the 2011 mac book. I did a fresh Sierra install on the 2011 and still it doesn't show up.
