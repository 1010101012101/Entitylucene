Apple Mail Flags <body> I am having an odd issue that started in the last couple of weeks where by if I flag an email with a 'Grey' coloured flag Mail changes this flag to 'Red' a couple of minutes later, I will therefore continually keep reflagging it with the correct colour until eventually it accepts the colour after multiple attempts.   This is most frustrating as I use my mail flags to divide up my mail and they are synced across multiple Macs which have all started exhibiting this behaviour, I have used flags like this for years with no issues and now am suddenly experiencing this odd behaviour any suggestions in why this might be occurring and how to prevent it?
