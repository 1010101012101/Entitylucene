preview highlight shape <body> I am using 10.8.5 with Preview V 6.0.1(765.6).  When I use Tools-Annotate-Highlight Text to select texts in order to highlight them, I expect it to be a rectangle region. But it is not, see the picture below.  Personally, I don't like it being this way (if this is not a bug). I tried 3 different PDF files, and I got the same results.  Is there any option to change this?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IYl43.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer117056> This isn't a bug, strongit's a feature/strong, designed to replicate a real-life highlighter. The highlight feature works the same in the new iBooks, as well as iBooks for iOS. strongThere is currently no way to change this./strong  You can provide feedback to Apple regarding this at the following page:  ul lihttp://www.apple.com/feedback/macosx.html/li /ul  <comment136812> Seems to be a feature, at least it behaves the same way in 10.9.
