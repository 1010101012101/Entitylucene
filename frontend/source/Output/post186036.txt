how do i remove Ubuntu from my macbook? <body> i just bought a Macbook from someone off of Craigslist but it has Ubuntu software on it, but I want the regular Apple OS. how do I remove Ubuntu without damaging the computer and its files?  <answer186039> Since you got it from Craigslist, you do not know what is on it, and you do not want to know nor to have it.  Get a working bootable USB with OS X on it.  Format the drive that will erase all the information on it.  Install OSX from the USB.  <answer186132> The other option would be to boot into recovery mode (COMMAND-R at boot) go into disk utility and (if O/S X strongis/strong on the HD) delete the Ubuntu partition and expand the Mac partition into that space.  <comment219568> Is there only Ubuntu on it or is OS X still also installed?  It the Recovery HD partition still intact?  Also what model number is the Mac? <comment219692> 1. Make a backup of the system so you can experiment without "damaging the files" - you won't damage the computer by erasing it. 2. Open terminal on the Mac and upload the results of `diskutil list disk0` 3. Use the edit button to explain what MacBook you have and what OS is loaded. Some allow internet recovery so you can manipulate the drive contents. Other need an external boot drive. Still others can have a Recovery HD to do the work. <comment219694> This would be ideal if the Mac has a recovery HD. No harm will be done by attempting to boot into recovery, so this might be the ideal answer. <comment219695> Solid advice to be skeptical of software you didn't install, but the OP clearly states as a premise that they want to keep the software as it. Even if it's unwise, try not to confuse what you would do with what the OP is asking. They're clearly not looking to erase install at this point. <comment219698> @bmike And someone told me not to give answers in the Comments field :) <comment219699> @Buscarì›ƒ Yes I did ask you to refrain from that. What part of my comment  do you feel is answering this question? I'm happy to edit it if I'm not taking my own advice equally. <comment219701> @bmike thank you, I know exactly why I gave a answer like this. Based on the OP question, it is the most simple way getting rid off anything. It does not involve complicated process nor requires additional (expensive) hardware (like time machine or back up disk), just a $10 USB. It also make sure there are no orphans left. Furthermore I read that the OP is a novice user not a expert but I might be wrong here (without damaging the computer and its files)!?. It is a optional way, the choice resides with the OP and the comfort level.
