Why does my iOS device beep and vibrate even after turning off "sounds" in every app? <body> Why is my iPhone making a mystery tritone sound when the sound is on, and a mystery vibrate when set to silent? Yes, yes, I already read this answer: Why does my iOS device beep at noon every day?. I learned the same thing at the Genius Bar. But I've already turned "Sounds" off in every app that doesn't appear in my notification center. So, now what?  <answer116577> It turns out that there is one app that does not have a "Sounds" setting, but still produces sounds and vibrations: Calendar. It's easy to overlook the all-important setting "Calendar Alerts." Tap that, tap vibrate, scroll all the way to the bottom, and set vibration to "None." That should solve it.  strongHere's your problem right here:/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vjo2q.png" width="400"  strongJust turn vibration off:/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7O2hR.png" width="400"  strongThat's right!/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/X6rRo.png" width="400"
