Photo Sharing from iTunes <body> In iTunes, from the Advanced menu, I selected Photos to Share.  I then picked a folder and the hard drive cranked at full speed for good 5-10 minutes.  I do not see any of the photos on the iPad.  So, who did I actually share the Photos with?  <answer45148> You don't copy Photos to an iPad using the Advanced menu…  Here’s how I do it: go to iTunes → Devices → Your iOS Device → Photos → enable “Sync Photos from…” and choose either iPhoto album(s) or a folder on your hard drive. Then press the Sync button in the bottom right corner.  See Apple Knowledgebase: iOS and iPod: Syncing photos using iTunes for more details.  <answer45152> Mathias is correct about the proper way to strongsync/strong photos to your iPad. strongSharing/strong photos from iTunes approves them for emHome Sharing/em, a system designed to share iTunes Store purchases and media amongst family members.  Apple Knowledgebase: iTunes: Setting up Home Sharing on your computer  Home Sharing can also be used to allow access to photos from an AppleTV.  Apple Knowledgebase: Setting up Home Sharing for Apple TV (2nd generation)  <answer45154> It seems that strongAdvanced  Choose Photos to Share/strong uses iTunes' Home Sharing feature to share photos with Apple TV devices.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xxr1G.png" alt="enter image description here"  If you want to sync photos from your computer to the iPad, you can either use PhotoStream or enable photo syncing when you connect the iPad.  <comment51356> can you add screen shots of the steps you took, I think you may have missed something along the way. <comment51511> So just that I have this right.  I can share video and audio from iTunes to the iPad (without having to sync or take up space on the iPad), but not Photos? <comment51546> So long as you're on a shared network you can access songs or videos in a Mac's (and maybe a PC's) iTune's Library using the iPad. Photos aren't stored in the iTunes Library and while you can Home Share for access from an AppleTV (2g), I don't believe they're any mechanism for doing the same on an iPad, iPhone or iPod Touch.
