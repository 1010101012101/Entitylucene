Sierra changed the way files are saved from my scanner or Bridge <body> In the past when I scanned a photo and went to save it, all my other files would show up within that folder and I could click on one that was the same person and simply add a number rather than typing the entire file name each time. After the Sierra upgrade, when I go to save, all the icons in the file are ghosted and I can't click on them to use the file name as a template for my image.br I know this doesn't sound like a big issue, but I'm scanning 1,000s of negative and any time I can save, the better.  Any ideas?  Thank you, Nan
