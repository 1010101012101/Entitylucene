OS X Server File Sharing Permissions <body> I’m trying to use OS X Server on Mavericks in a small team within my organization. I was able to successfully install and setup the server, which resides in a local network.   ol liOpen Directory Setup /li liFile Sharing, /Users, available for home directory over AFP/li liCreated Network users with home folder pointing to /Users/li liBound Clients to the server/li liXcode Server Setup with git repository/li /ol  Users now can login using their own account and their home folder is loaded from the server. Unfortunately there are issues. Clients are having permission issues, which we have never encountered on local machines before we switched to using Xcode Server. Here is a list of some of the issues so far   Xcode issues on client computer:   ul liWhen creating a XCode project, it reports the error “Couldn’t not find build module Drawin” when clicking create button. I found online a workaround fix that supposedly works, which is to set "Enable Modules (C and Objective C)" to No. But we didn’t have to do this before using Xcode server./li liWhen committing to git repo , the following error happens:     fatal: Repository has been updated , but unable to write to new_index. Check the disk is not full or quota is not exceeded , and then "git reset HEAD"   to recover   Another work around we found online is to do on the client:  precodecp index backup ; mv backup index /code/pre/li /ul  We don’t want to have to do this every time we create a project. What could be wrong with the setup?
