Why is the playlist size increasing for a shuffled playlist? <body> I have had this problem on my previous (iPhone 4, iOS 7) and current (iPhone 6+, iOS 8) phones.  I have a single playlist of my favorite songs - 3534 tracks, according to the Music app. I try to listen to the entire playlist, shuffled, from beginning to end.  As I listen to song after song, the display in the Music app showing how many songs are on the playlist slowly increases. This morning when I left my house I was on track 562 of 3619. When I got to the office, I was on 571 of 3620.  The playlist size should be constant at 3534. What is causing it to slowly increase?  <comment229936> I took screenshots and can post them, if anyone feels they would improve the question. <comment229951> Does it do the same on a tiny playlist? - might help you spot the unexpected addition to the tracklist, or whether it's trying to play something twice.
