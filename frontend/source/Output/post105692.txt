Can I replace my old model MBA battery with a 54-watt-hour lithium-polymer battery (12 hrs) for the newest model MBA? <body> I have a A1304 MBA and need to replace the battery with a new one.  I was considering to install a 54-watt-hour lithium-polymer battery (12 hours battery life) for the newest model MBA.  Is it compatible to my old model MBA? Will it have a technical problem after I install it?    <answer121221> This won't work. See Geek.com's teardown for details, but the battery looks physically larger and differently shaped than the old MBA battery.
