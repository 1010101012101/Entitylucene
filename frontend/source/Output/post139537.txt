What do each of the files do inside of an iPhoto Library? <body> Inside my iPhoto library, there are many files and directories.  precode-rw-r--r--@  1 kevin  staff   3.9M Jul 10 21:10 AlbumData.xml drwxr-xr-x   2 kevin  staff    68B Dec 23  2013 Attachments drwxr-xr-x   2 kevin  staff    68B Dec 23  2013 Auto Import drwxr-xr-x  21 kevin  staff   714B Jul 10 21:10 Database -rw-r--r--@  1 kevin  staff   324B Dec 23  2013 Info.plist drwxr-xr-x   3 kevin  staff   102B Jan  9  2014 Masters drwxr-xr-x   3 kevin  staff   102B Jan  9  2014 Previews -rw-r--r--@  1 kevin  staff   341B Dec 23  2013 ProjectDBVersion.plist -rw-r--r--@  1 kevin  staff   576K Jul 10 21:10 Projects.db drwxr-xr-x   4 kevin  staff   136B Jan  9  2014 Thumbnails drwxr-xr-x   4 kevin  staff   136B Jul 10 21:10 iLifeShared -rw-r--r--@  1 kevin  staff     1B Jul 10 21:10 iPhotoLock.data drwxr-xr-x@ 55 kevin  staff   1.8K Jul  7 10:00 iPod Photo Cache /code/pre  Inside the codeDatabase/code folder:  precodedrwxr-xr-x  801 kevin  staff    27K Jul 10 21:10 Albums lrwxr-xr-x@   1 kevin  staff    18B Dec 23  2013 BigBlobs.apdb -&gt; apdb/BigBlobs.apdb -rw-r--r--@   1 kevin  staff   2.4K Jul 10 21:10 DataModelVersion.plist drwxr-xr-x    6 kevin  staff   204B Dec 23  2013 Faces lrwxr-xr-x@   1 kevin  staff    13B Dec 23  2013 Faces.db -&gt; apdb/Faces.db drwxr-xr-x  800 kevin  staff    27K Jul 10 21:10 Folders drwxr-xr-x    3 kevin  staff   102B Dec 23  2013 History lrwxr-xr-x@   1 kevin  staff    17B Dec 23  2013 History.apdb -&gt; apdb/History.apdb lrwxr-xr-x@   1 kevin  staff    22B Dec 23  2013 ImageProxies.apdb -&gt; apdb/ImageProxies.apdb -rw-r--r--@   1 kevin  staff   1.5K May 21 18:22 Keywords.plist lrwxr-xr-x@   1 kevin  staff    17B Dec 23  2013 Library.apdb -&gt; apdb/Library.apdb drwxr-xr-x    2 kevin  staff    68B Dec 23  2013 Places lrwxr-xr-x@   1 kevin  staff    20B Dec 23  2013 Properties.apdb -&gt; apdb/Properties.apdb -rw-r--r--@   1 kevin  staff    42B Mar 15 20:31 SpanCache.plist drwxr-xr-x    2 kevin  staff    68B Dec 23  2013 Vaults drwxr-xr-x    3 kevin  staff   102B Jan  9  2014 Versions drwxr-xr-x    3 kevin  staff   102B May 21 18:21 Volumes drwxr-xr-x    9 kevin  staff   306B Jul 10 21:10 apdb -rw-r--r--@   1 kevin  staff   304B Jul 10 21:10 tmSync.plist /code/pre  What parts of iPhoto are these files and directories responsible for?  <answer139545> strongBasically, all the files like codexml, db/code and such help different softwares like iPhoto, iMovies etc gain information about your photos./strong  strongExcerpted from Fat Cat Software: iPhoto Library Internals help page:/strong     strongAlbumData.xml/strong      This file is written out by iPhoto as a way for other applications   (such as iMovie and iDVD) to be able to easily access the contents of   your iPhoto library. You can read in more detail about this file here.      strongAlbumData2.xml/strong      This file is only created by iPhoto 8. It is a smaller version of the   AlbumData.xml file that only contains information for the library's   albums and events, and none of the actual photos. This file is faster   to read for programs that only need to get the list of albums and   events in the library.      strongAttachments/strong      This folder is used by iPhoto 9 as a temporary holding place for   photos that are being sent using iPhoto's built-in email features.      strongAuto Import/strong      This folder is created by iPhoto 7 and later. There does not seem to   be any mention of this folder in iPhoto's documentation, but if you   put some photos into it, then quit and reopen iPhoto, it will   automatically import those photos into the iPhoto library and then   delete them from the Auto Import folder. There is also an "auto   import" Applescript command which does not appear to do anything when   called. It's not clear if this was a planned feature for iPhoto 7 that   ended up getting pulled out (but not completely, apparently), and it   doesn't seem to be very useful for anything, especially since that   folder is buried inside a package now, but that's what it does if   anyone is curious.      strongBackup/strong      If a library has been upgraded from an earlier version of iPhoto to   iPhoto 9, a copy of the original database files from the library are   stored in this folder before performing the upgrade.      strongCaches/strong      Only present in iPhoto 8 or later, this folder contains additional   data for the iPhoto library. Unlike some other Caches folders that can   be safe to delete, this one is not, so don't go deleting it in an   attempt to clear up disk space.      strongcom.apple.iPhoto.plist/strong      This file is actually not written out by iPhoto itself, but rather by   iPhoto Library Manager. It is a copy of the preferences file that is   associated with this library. When you switch between different iPhoto   libraries, iPhoto Library Manager will swap out this preference file   for the existing preferences before opening the library up.      strongContents/PkgInfo/strong      This is part of the new package structure in iPhoto 7 that gives the   package a type and creator code so that the Finder knows what   application the package belongs to.      strongface.db, face_blob.db/strong      Contains the data for faces identified by the face recognition feature   added in iPhoto 8.      strongiLifeShared/strong      Starting in iPhoto 9, the AlbumData2.xml file is now stored within   this folder rather than at the root level of the library package.      strongInfo.plist/strong      iPhoto 9 added this file, containing basic version information about   the library      strongiPhoto.ipspot/strong      This file is written out by iPhoto and read in by Spotlight in order   to index the information about the photos in your photo library. You   must have iPhoto 5.0.2 or later for this file to be present.      strongiPhotoLock.data/strong      This file is used by iPhoto to help prevent more than one copy of   iPhoto from accessing the library at one time.      strongiPod Photo Cache/strong      This folder is created by iTunes if you choose to sync your iPhoto   library with a photo capable iPod. It contains cached information   about the last time the photos were synced and help speed up the   syncing process, allowing iTunes to tell which photos have changed   since the last sync and only update those ones. You can delete it if   you want to clear up space, but iTunes will have to create it all over   again the next time you sync your iPod's photos.      strongLibrary.data, Dir.data (iPhoto 2), Library.iPhoto, iPhoto.db (iPhoto 4, &amp; 5), Library.iPhoto6 (iPhoto 6 &amp; 7), iPhotoMain.db, iPhotoAux.db   (iPhoto 8), Database (iPhoto 9)/strong      These files/folders serve as the central database where iPhoto stores   your library information. All your event, album, and photo metadata is   stored in these files.      strongData, Originals, and Modified/strong      iPhoto 6 organizes its photos fairly differently that previous   versions. Imported photos will initially be stored inside the   "Originals" folder. Within that folder, photos are organized into   subfolders based on the roll that they are in, so each roll gets its   own folder. Those rolls are then sorted by date (2006, 2005, etc.) and   put into dated folders accordingly. So, if you had a photo in a roll   named "Vacation" and dated February 24, 2004, to find that photo, go   into the "Originals" folder, then into "2004", then into the folder   named "Vacation". When you edit a photo in iPhoto, the original stays   where it is, and the edited photo is placed in the "Modified" folder,   which has the same per-roll organization scheme within it as the   "Originals" folder does. The "Data" folder contains all the scaled   down thumbnail version of photos in your library. If you upgrade to   iPhoto 6 from a previous version, iPhoto will rearrange all your   photos from the old scheme into the new scheme. After upgrading, you   may still see one or more leftover folders named "2004" and such.   These folders should no longer contain any files being used by iPhoto   6, and can be disposed of safely.      strongThumbnails, Masters, and Previews/strong      iPhoto 9 organizes photos in much the same way as iPhoto 6-8, but uses   the folder names Thumbnails, Masters, and Previews instead of Data,   Originals, and Modified      strongMetadata Backup/strong      Created by iPhoto 8, containing backup copies of the metadata for your   photos, events, albums, and other library content. This information   can be used by iPhoto to recover a library whose main database has   been corrupted.      strongProjectDBVersion.plist, Projects.db, Projects.db-journal, SharingActivity.db/strong      These additional data files exist only in iPhoto 9 and contain   information relating to "keepsake" items such as books and slideshows,   and information for albums published on MobileMe, Flickr, or Facebook.      strongThemeCache/strong      A cache file used by iPhoto to store theme data used to make books,   calendars, and cards      strongThumb32Segment.data, Thumb64Segment.data, ThumbJPGSegment.data/strong      In order to improve performance, when you add photos to your library,   iPhoto creates small "thumbnail" versions of your photos and caches   them in these files. In iPhoto 5 and earlier, these files are instead   called Thumb32.data, Thumb64.data, and ThumbJPG.data.   strongNote that there are some small and some large differences in the folder structure depending on what version of iPhoto you're using./strong
