OS X Terminal fn+delete doesn't work, prints ~ <body> I recently did a fresh install of Mavericks, and ever since I haven't been able to use the kbdfn/kbdkbddelete/kbd keystroke in Terminal. On the command prompt, kbdfn/kbdkbddelete/kbd prints code~/code and if I'm in vim, kbdfn/kbdkbddelete/kbd will capitalize existing characters.   How can I reset this in Terminal so it functions normally? (Terminal is the only place I have this problem.)  <answer115018> I was able to fix this by going to Terminal-Preferences-Advanced and choosing xterm-256color as the setting for "Declare Terminal As"  <comment134676> You should accept this answer, if you're sure this is what solved your problem!
