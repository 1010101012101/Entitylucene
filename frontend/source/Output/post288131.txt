Get rid of annoying Proxy acceptance popup windows <body> I have just started to use proxy. It is set up system wide (Wifi - Advanced - Proxy). But macOS keeps me asking to allow using proxies by different apps.  Like that  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xZHJF.png" alt="enter image description here"  It is really annoying, because I have a lot of applications installed. Furthermore it seems that some apps are requesting permissions again and again.  Please suggest, how suppress this window and allow all by default.  <comment363799> Welcome to Ask Different!
