iphone 6 text messages showing phone number not contact name - not for all text messages - only on some of them <body> Suddenly, existing text strings are showing the contact number (not for all text messages), and not the contact name. If I look for the person in my contacts, they are not listed. If I use their name to start a text discussion, their name and number show in the 'search' like if they were in the contacts.    <answer293890> I've seen this happen to me before. To fix it for myself I've had to disable codeiCloud Contacts/code and then enable them.  Although, it might be best to restart your device before disabling and then reenabling your iCloud contacts?  Steps:  ol liSettings/li liApple ID (top of settings)/li liiCloud (2nd set, 1st item)/li liToggle contacts switch to disable/li liDelete from My iPhone/li liToggle contacts switch to reenable/li /ol  <comment370841> Do you have a contact stored for all of the people you are messaging?
