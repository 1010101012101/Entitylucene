What can I do to add new contacts to iPhone 4? <body> Why can't I add new contacts in my agenda iPhone 4? Every time when I want to write the name of a new person, my phone doesn't show the "keyboard".  <answer197859> Put the device in Airplane mode, power it off, then try using notes.app to type. If that works, open the contacts app and try to edit a contact.  If that all works, you can turn off airplane mode and try again. If contacts still fails, you have issues with your database or online sync for contacts.  <comment236694> Could you clarify? can you attach some screenshots of the issue you're facing?
