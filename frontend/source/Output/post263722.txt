Print a b&w document with coloured ink (out of black ink) <body> I want to print a document in, say, red ink, instead of black ink, because I have colour ink but no black ink left. Is there a setting I have missed in the default printer settings, or some quick way in preview to change text colour?  This didn't work for me, and I have tried copying and pasting the text into Word, but the formatting got screwed up. I would like to avoid doing this manually in photoshop as I have a lot to print.  (I'm on 10.11.6 El Capitan)
