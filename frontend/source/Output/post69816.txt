Is there a way for registering iWork apps on App Store? <body> I bought iWork 09 at the Apple Store and it is installed on my MacBook Pro.  However, since I didn't buy it on the Mac App Store, when I go to the Mac App Store purchased tab the iWork apps are not listed.  Is there a way to register them on Mac App Store?  <answer69817> No, I'll link to some of the questions that cover this. The App Store version is sold and licensed differently than the version licensed online.  ul liDo I have to repurchase Apple apps through the Mac App Store to get updates there?/li liIs there any reason to buy the iWork bundle instead of the apps separately from the App Store?/li liCan I update apps that I&#39;ve already purchased through the Mac App Store?/li /ul
