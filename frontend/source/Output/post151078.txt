Replacing Yosemite RED/ORANGE/GREEN window buttons with standard Mac OS X icons? <body> I've tried Yosemite on my MacBook Air (testing machine). I think it is ugly, bland, and the most un-Apple-ish OS that Apple has ever released. One of the most irritating design aspects is the RED/AMBER/GREEN window buttons (Close/minimise etc) which look to me like they were designed by a child.  Are there any tricks or methods for replacing the Yosemite rendition of these Mac OS X buttons with the usual ones we are all familiar with?   <answer151083> There are some applications that allow you to change the theme in OS X.  However they might need a little time to be updated for the new UI in Yosemite.  For example Flavours which is being updated but isn't quite ready yet.  <answer160194> There's only one theme that I know of for Yosemite that changes the traffic lights:  http://www.deviantart.com/art/Yosemite-Theme-Clearify-477715451  Be careful when replacing system files like these, always backup your system and keep copies of the original files somewhere safe!  <answer265775> I made a quick theme to change the 'traffic lights' to how they were before.
