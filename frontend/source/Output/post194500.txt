How can I tell if my Time Machine backup is encrypted? <body> Is there a method to determine if a Time Machine backup disk is already encrypted?  <answer194977> This is a little round-a-bout but, without dropping to Terminal or anything more technical, will let you determine the encrypted state of the volume.  ol liOpen System Preferences/li liChoose Time Machine/li liClick "Select Disk..."/li liHighlight the current disk listed under Backup Disks img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/soQbN.png" alt="Backup Disks &amp; Available Disks Menu"/li liClick "Remove Disk" button. This is NOT destructive. You are just un-associating the disk momentarily./li liClick "Stop Using Disk"/li liClick "Select Backup Disk"/li liSelect the same disk you just Removed ("Data" in my screen shot)/li liSelect "Encrypt backups"/li liClick "Use Disk"/li liAuthorize as prompted/li liIf the disk is not encrypted you will see a dialog like the following img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TwMrn.png" alt="Dialog box when trying to use a non-encrypted volume as an encrypted Time Machine backup"/li liChoose "Use Unencrypted" to resume using the same volume unencrypted or "Erase Existing Backup" to create a fresh, encrypted backup./li /ol  <answer261619> I thought I'll add to the subject since I was looking for this info recently.  It actually shows just above the progress bar if the backup is encrypted during the backup process.  I'm pretty sure this was there since Maverick.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TB59q.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment232422> Try to Mount its sparsebundle on a different Machine.
