Using Homebrew to convert TIFF to PDF <body> How can I convert JPG into PDF easily? shows have to use codehomebrew/code to convert .jpg files into .pdf. I would like to convert many TIFF files to PDF but can not get it to work.  For JPEG files, the advice was to use the following command:  ol licodebrew install imagemagick/code/li licodeconvert *.jpg output.pdf/code/li /ol  I am trying to use the Step 2 command for *.TIFF files into *.PDF.   However, despite using the command line to the letter, I am unable to change my 300 files with this single line. In fact, no file is converted at all.  Would anyone be so kind to provide a helping hand ?  <answer287528> The code*/code in codeconvert *.jpg output.pdf/code expands to the list of inputs. This means the command you were actually running looked like:  precodeconvert one.jpg two.jpg three.jpg output.pdf /code/pre  As you can see from this, that's not what you want, since all the images will be compiled into the output PDF. Also, as the command contains ‘jpg’, it looks for ‘jpg’ files, not ‘tiff’, so you need to change this too.  Therefore, you need to run that command for each of the inputs.  precodefind /path/to/folder -iname "*.tiff" -exec convert {} {}.pdf \; /code/pre  <comment363022> Have you tried the command `convert *.tiff output.pdf`? What message or output is returned? <comment363025> I forgot to mention that i was looking to have each individual .jpg file to be converted into a .pdf file of the same name. <comment363026> i tried this command but files are compl=iled into a single file. i'm looking to have individual files with the same name as the original file <comment363049> Ho MY GOD... this is exactly what i have been looking for!!!!!! <comment363050> do you think there is a similar language that can be used for DOS? <comment363051> I ask this because now that i understand what to do on my mac at home, i need to replicate this on my office machine, which is running on a microsoft  windows platform. <comment363052> Excellent, welcome to Ask Different!
