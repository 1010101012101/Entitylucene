Airport Express - WiFi network extension with wireless speakers <body> strongBackground:/strong I am considering an Airport Express (AE) to my room, but I am getting confusing information about how it can operate in different circumstances. I already have a router, with WiFi and LAN ports. The AE would be connected by cable to currently owned router and I would also like to connect my Mac by wire to the AE.  strongQuestion:/strong What I want to do is extend WiFi signal in our flat and also have the possibility to use my speakers wirelessly. Is it possible with the current AE?  <answer79840> Yes you can use the Airport Express to extend the wifi signal from your other router: You just have to change the settings for your device in the Aiport utility to extend a network instead of creating a new one.  http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4145#  Yes you can use your speakers wirelessly. You just need to connect them to Airport Express.
