Great iPod Click Wheel Games for Kids <body> My niece has got a used iPod nano (not the newest model); in the App Store are about 50 games for iPods with Click Wheel. What game can you recommend?  <answer16123> I have fond memories of the Sonic the Hedgehog game on older iPods :)  <answer22201> Vortex and Pacman are quite good as well. They're listed in iTunes as 5th generation compatible (Sonic... is for 3rd, 4th and 5th generation devices). I've got a 30GB video capable iPod and they all work fine...  <comment25319> If I remember correctly, Vortex came preinstalled on my nieces iPod nano, and is played oftenly. In the end I bought her Bubble Bash which pleased her a lot.
