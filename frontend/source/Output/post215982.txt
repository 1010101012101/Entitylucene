My Mac Mini won't go to sleep <body> For some reason my mac mini refuses to start the screensaver or go to sleep unless I put the mouse into a hot corner. Energy saver is set to 3 mins as is system sleep. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.  i have included a PMSET -G result but  don't really understand it. Many thanks.

It's pretty verbose, but it really shows what's going on to prevent a sleep from happening.  precodepmset -g assertionslog /code/pre  If you need a smaller set of data to look at, just ask for the current status and not an ongoing log of what's set and what's changing.  precodepmset -g assertions /code/pre  You can close the window when you're done with the tools.  <comment260978> could it be that your mouse sends a 'moving' signal to your machine? Have you unplugged your keyboard and mouse and tried to wait for 3 min? <comment260979> Have you tried to use another user account? <comment260997> What's a "hot corner"? (Literally a corner of the room that is hot?!) <comment260998> @w3d In the system preferences, you can specify actions when the cursor enters any of the 4 screen corners. I have my display sleep/off when the cursor is in the lower left corner for instance. <comment261135> Thanks.  i did a pmset -g assertions and spotted this.     -------- Listed by owning process:  pid 181: [0x000000b5012c0009] PreventUserIdleDisplaySleep named: "extension" `code`-------- Any idea how  to got about deleting/editing this 'extension' what ever it is? Many thanks. <comment261169> @joachim You could use Activity Monitor to look at that PID (process identifier number) - without knowing what it was and if it's still holding sleep 5 minutes later, it's hard to say what to do next. Be sure to show all processes in the monitor. <comment261381> That all worked great. Discovered an extension that was keeing it awake. Thanks.
