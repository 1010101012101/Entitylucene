Skype is showing the wrong last messages <body> I have a conversation between three users. When I look into this conversation the last messages are from Friday, which is wrong. These messages are always at the bottom (appears at last). So always the same messages appears at last despite there are newer messages.  I tried to reinstall Skype but it is still the same. Has anyone also experienced this kind of problem? What can I do?  <answer182244> I use Skype for Mac (as I presume you do), and I've had to troubleshoot contact status issues. In my notes are the following comments with respect to keeping a "detailed log:"  ol liType in any chat line: /setupkey *Lib/LogLevel 4/li liThen quit and restart Skype./li liThen type in chat line: /resynccontacts/li /ol  Other commands:  /resynclivecontacts  So you probably don't need the detailed session log, but try the resync commands.  strongFor a more advanced method, here is another procedure from my notes:/strong  ol liQuit Skype completely/li liAccess https://m.hotmail.com in any browser/li liYou should see a "403" error page/li liRestart Skype and verify the contacts are loading/li /ol  Does that help? I'm sorry that I can't elaborate on the commands and techniques, since these were methods that I found without supporting explanation.  <comment216842> When I enter `/resynclivecontacts` I get the info to look onto [this help page](http://www.skype.com/go/help.chathelp). But that didn't helped. I also didn't found a */resyncchat*. I also tried the second option, but here I get a white page. So I'm still getting the same wrong message at the end of the conversation. <comment216896> An update is available for Skype for Mac. Perhaps it would help to install the latest, for both you and the other users. Aside from that, this appears to be an ongoing issue:  http://community.skype.com/t5/Windows-desktop-client/Skype-Messages-Out-Of-Order/td-p/1312417/page/11 <comment217021> Now I copied the wrong conversation and looked what time they are. They are from the first of May. I can remember that I have one time changed the time for a test and this was the first of May. So it seems that I have to wait for the first of May and the problem should be away (or clear the history which I don't want)! Thanks for the link. I give you tick if I solved my problem.
