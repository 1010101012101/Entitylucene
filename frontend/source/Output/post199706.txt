Extra characters are added to a file when opened via ios Email application <body> I am having the following scenario:  ol liI send a file to my email address/li liIf i download the file from my Mac, the downloaded file is the same as the original file/li liIf i forward the file to myself using the iOS email app, the sent file has extra weird characters and does not match the original file. This does not happen is i use Gmail app./li liThe same happens if i try to open the file using my ios app. The file read in the application has extra characters at the end./li /ol  Any idea how to fix this behavior?  <comment240483> What kind of file are you talking about exactly?  What extra characters? <comment240575> ASCII files. Characters such as: œÞR“™ŒÌ“Õ’•˜šÕ– Ø™ÜÜQŠÙÝ˜ÑTÕQLXSÒ‘ÙV›ÝÔLNTŠÙUÚS–[ÌÙÜÌT•Ò[Y\^ L™YØÌÌÓ]RSU\œÒ–XÚÔžYZÛÓXÎ]ÞÕÍÕÔ“Q‘ÑLÙRLSSÓÑ’[ÝÛÔ]ÞU”šÕÕUÕ\QRL <comment240590> Lots of those characters are not ASCII, so the encoding must actually be something else.  Are these .txt files?  Made by what app?
