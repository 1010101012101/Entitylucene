Keyboard shortcuts for shutting down Mac, restarting, etc. stopped working since upgrading to macOS Sierra <body> Since I upgraded to macOS Sierra, the keyboard shortcuts to restart my Mac, shut it down, etc. don't work anymore. I press them, and nothing happens.  However, if I restart my Mac, then they briefly work, only once I think, and then I have to restart my Mac before the key combinations work again.  Anyone know what's going on with this, and how I can fix it?  The combinations can be found here.
