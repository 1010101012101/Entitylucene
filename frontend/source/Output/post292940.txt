Devices don't remember that I've used them before <body> When I reboot either my macpro or my laptop the following events happen:  A: On signing into any google app, I get asked to re-authenticate.  (I use Authenticator on my phone for my second factor.  Even though I have "Remember me on this device" I get asked to re-enter every time.  B: Right after entering my icloud password, I get an email notification that my account is used on a new device.    In our household we have 4 macs, 2 ipads, 2 iphones.  Anyone can use any device, so, with the ipads in particular, we are signing out one person and signing in another.  My devices seem to have selective amnesia.
