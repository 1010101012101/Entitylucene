How to fix lsregister failing associations after reboot? <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   How do I remove duplicate “Open With” context menu items in Finder.app?       I'm running 10.7.5 and I have noticed a problem with associations between files and applications. The main symptom is that Finder shows more than one copy of the same application to open a file.  At first everything worked, but now the codecom.apple.LaunchServices.plist/code file is not updated anymore. In particular, if I launch through terminal codelsregister -dump/code the association appears, but if I open the plist file the association is not present. If I reboot, instead of updating the plist file, the system eliminates the association from the database (the option code-dump/code doesn't show it anymore). I tried to launch codelsregister -kill -seed/code several times, but the situation doesn't change.  How can I permanently fix the associations between files and applications?  <answer66870> The LaunchServices database is built with data from as many as four domains. (See 'lsregister --help' for more info on these domains.) You might not be rebuilding the LaunchServices database correctly.  This is the command I use to rebuild the database on my Mac:  precodesudo /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user /code/pre  If you really want to get into the nitty gritty of file associations (plus a whole lot more) and want a nice GUI to boot try installing RCDefaultApp.  http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/14618/rcdefaultapp  <comment78765> I tried running `sudo opensnoop -n lsregister`, and there were much less lines when `-domain local -domain system -domain user` was left out. I don't know if the `-r` or `-seed` options are needed though. <comment99381> I had to use the command without `sudo` to clean-up the list.
