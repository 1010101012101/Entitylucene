An unexpected error occurred while downloading the dictation language <body> I'm on Yosemite and trying to download Enhanced dictation language files for English (USA). Default language is set to English (Australia) I don't know why.   I'm getting this error. I have also tried the solution given here https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5480134 but it doesn't solve the problem.  Can anybody here help?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CV9Dr.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment180793> Could you check your settings in System Preferences  Language & Region… Make sure to have in the "prefered language" list "U.S. English" (it doesn't have to be the primary)…
