CanoScan LiDE 20 on El Capitan <body> I have a Canon CanoScan LiDE 20 that won't work on my MacBook Air (13-inch, Mid 2013), 1.7 GH Intel Core i7 with 8 GB of RAM and El Capitan 10.11.5.  Following instruction found on this site: https://macmanus.nl/tag/twainbridge-app/ I installed the following software (in this order):  ol liLibUSB for OSX 10.11/li liSANE Backends for OSX 10.11/li liSANE Preference Pane for OSX 10.11/li liTWAIN SANE Interface for OSX 10.11/li /ol  (all files found on this site: http://www.ellert.se/twain-sane/)  Despite several restarts, the scanner won't appear neither in System Preferences â†’ Printers &amp; Scanners, nor in Image Capture. However my CanoScan LiDE 100 does appear.  Nevertheless, with VueScan (a paid for app found here: https://www.hamrick.com) the scanner works perfectly (proving that the apparatus is not broken).  Any suggestions as to what could be done?
