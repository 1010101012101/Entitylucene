Cleaned hard drive, reinstalled OSX- now all my iTunes purchased music is gone <body> When I try to download already purchased songs I get this message:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/asflM.png" alt="enter image description here"  Will I be charged once more if I click "Buy"?  Ps. When I click "Check for available downloads" I just get the message  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SZSID.png" alt="enter image description here"  Psps. It might just be that the new Itunes is buggy. I get this startup-screen, but when I click "scan for music", nothing happens.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ta0HT.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer81595> Sign in to itunes, click iTunes Store. In the right hand column there is a link to "purchased"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ycNYZ.jpg" alt="enter image description here"   This opens to a screen that looks like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2n2tV.png" alt="Purchased Screen Shot"  You can re-download everything from there as long as its all on the single apple ID.  Good Luck!  <answer81843> When repurchasing from the iTunes store I was charged once more, so do not use the "repurchase" option.  Only US users are allowed to redownload music. Thank god for torrent sites.  Source: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3103354?start=15&amp;tstart=0  Ps. iTunes refunded my money so all is well.  Psps. will update when/if I get to the bottom of this.  <comment94072> Did you have iCloud enabled? Did you make a backup before cleaning the hard drive? <comment94073> No; I just thought it was a no-brainer that Apple should keep track of what I purchased. I mean, it must be in my account somewhere. <comment94075> You can redownload apps but AFAIK you can't redownload music (without iCloud at least). That's why you get a dialog box reminding you of backup up your purchases if you buy music. <comment94076> I tried repurchasing an album. Will see how it goes and notify you all. <comment94078> This is probably how it is supposed to work in theory so UV <comment94206> I was charged anew! Waah!
