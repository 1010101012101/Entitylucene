Can I swap an LCD between different laptop generations? <body> I have a pair of old laptops:  ul li15" PowerBook G4 (Aluminum) with various issues, but a working screen/li li15" MacBook Pro (2007) with a broken screen, but otherwise fine/li /ul  Can the PowerBook screen be transplanted into the MacBook body?  If so, does it require: Mac-specific tools? Additional parts? Custom driver? Soldering?  <answer143344> No the parts are not compatible nor are the cabling and mount points.  See http://ifixit.com for take apart manuals and possibly repair parts for your broken LCD on the MacBook Pro.
