Add a tone as an Alert Tone rather than as a Ringtone <body> I have successfully added a tone to my iPhone 7, as explained in this Apple Communities discussion.  However it is getting added as a “ringtone” rather than as an “alert tone.”  How can I change it to an Alert Tone? It’s barely 1-second long. When syncing or creating the code.m4r/code file, there is no option to select the type as either Ringtone or Alert Tone.  The reason I need this is to add a custom notification for a WhatsApp contact. WhatsApp only allows me to choose from Alert Tones.  So the way I see it there are two options:  ol liAsk WhatsApp to allow to choose from Ringtones./li liAdd my own Alert Tone. /li /ol  I am exploring option 2 here, because WhatsApp support isn’t being very helpful.  <answer258316> As of iOS 11 it is not possible to create custom strongAlert Tones/strong, only custom strongRingtones/strong.  iTunes itself only makes one strongMedia Kind/strong available for them: emRingtone/em. That cannot be changed.  You can assign both strongRingtones/strong and strongAlert Tones/strong to any event under strongSettings/strong → strongSounds &amp; Haptics/strong on your iOS device.  As far as app-specific limitations are concerned, you’ll have to take it up to the developers of such apps, in this case WhatsApp. I doubt Apple will add that functionality, since it makes no difference to iOS itself.  <comment322883> Does it really matter, when you can choose any ringtone as an alert anyway? <comment322885> actually, i am trying to add custom notification for a whatsapp contact. Whatsapp 'Customization Notification" option allows to choose from alert tones only. so there are two options, 1) ask whatsapp to allow to choose a ringtone 2) be able to add my own alert tone. i am exploring option 2 here. for option 1, already sent mail to whatsapp support. they are not helping. <comment322886> I've never used WhatsApp, so I've no clue how it works, sorry <comment322887> i have given the reason in the comment in the question <comment322888> This info would be better added to the original question, to save people asking the obvious first... as seems to have already happened... :/ <comment322890> somewhere i read that the duration of the tone matters, if the duration is less, it can be added as alert tone <comment323316> is there a work-around to copy a tone to some folder so that apps can see it as alert tone <comment372042> No, there isn't. iTunes isn't even aware of **Alert Tones**, just **Ringtones**.
