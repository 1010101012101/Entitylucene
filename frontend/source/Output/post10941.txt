Where are the Mac OS X alert sound files located? <body> Is there any way I can access the files that are used for the alert sounds found in system preferences? For example, in OS X 10.6.6, there are different sounds for Funk, Glass, Hero, etc. Where are these files located?  <answer10942> They are stored as code.aiff/code files in code/System/Library/Sounds//code.  <answer10962> Any files located in the following locations will available to choose as alert sounds:  precode/System/Library/Sounds/ /Library/Sounds/ /Users/&lt; username &gt;/Library/Sounds/ /code/pre  (Note: By default the latter 2 folders may not exist, but if created and populated with files, you'll be able to choose them in the Sounds preference pane).  <answer236911> Here is the path to the volume.aiff if you want to change that too     /System/Library/LoginPlugins/BezelServices.loginPlugin/Contents/Resources   <comment11457> can we play from there? <comment11459> Click a file, press the space bar. Quicklook does the rest :).
