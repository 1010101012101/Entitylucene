Sync keyboard shortcuts between macOS computers <body> I have a couple of custom shortcuts defined using emSystem preferences  Keyboard  Shortcuts/em and I want to sync those between my two Macs.  It seems, this is still not possible using iCloud. Are there any other ways? I thought about including them into my dotfiles, but can not find the shortcuts using the codedefaults/code command.  <answer296321> Since you're using dot files, if you know what shortcuts you want to create ahead of time, you can add them to all machines by adding the following codedefaults write/code commands to your setup script:     strongPer App Shortcuts/strong: defaults write codecom.developer.app/code NSUserKeyEquivalents -dict-add "codeMenu Item/code" -string   "codekeyboardShortcut/code"      strongGlobal Shortcuts/strong: defaults write -g NSUserKeyEquivalents -dict-add "codeMenu Item/code" -string "codekeyboardShortcut/code"   ...where codecom.developer.app/code is the application's bundle ID, and codekeyboardShortcut/code is the letters of the keys you want to include, plus the symbols code@/code, code$/code, code~/code, and code^/code representing the Command, Shift, Alt, and Control keys, respectively. For example, code-string "@$K"/code would represent the keyboard shortcut kbd⌘/kbdkbd⌥/kbdkbdK/kbd.  hr  If you need to sync existing shortcuts, you're going to have to make a more complicated script. I imagine this would involve reading or comparing shortcuts on a source machine via:     strongPer App Shortcuts/strong: defaults read com.developer.app NSUserKeyEquivalents      strongGlobal Shortcuts/strong: defaults read -g NSUserKeyEquivalents   ...and writing them to a target machine via:     strongPer App Shortcuts/strong: defaults write codecom.developer.app/code NSUserKeyEquivalents 'codeoutputOfSourceMachine/code'      strongGlobal Shortcuts/strong: defaults write -g NSUserKeyEquivalents 'codeoutputOfSourceMachine/code'   <comment373668> I am adding a bounty to this question. Is there some alternative solution? Can the keyboard shortcuts be symlinked and synced through Dropbox? I guess the problem then would be that one Mac might have custom app keyboard shortcuts for an app that isn't installed on the other Mac...? <comment373752> I can’t add this as an answer as it may be taken down. If you are having trouble with the Apple stuff, I’m not sure why but it works for me between macs and even iOS devices, have you considered moving to a third-party solution such as *Keyboard Maestro*, which can be setup to use Dropbox to sync between computers? https://wiki.keyboardmaestro.com/Syncing_Macros_Between_Macs <comment373757> @jasonology I can't see any reason why offering that as an *answer* would be a problem. In fact, I'd encourage you to do just that! :) <comment374068> Isn't this dependent on what shortcuts you defined for what in which version of OS X/macOS? Have you tried integrating this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34561758/is-there-a-way-to-change-keyboard-shortcuts-with-shell-in-os-x ? My current understanding is that if the apps are shut down and the cfprefsd process is restarted the then restarted apps should pick up on the changes without the need to log out. <comment374254> @jasonology Can KeyboardMaestro bind custom shortcuts for previously non-shortcuted items in the applications' menu bar? I.e. as *System Preferences  Keyboard  Shortcuts  App Shortcuts*? That would be the holy grail for a third-party app to replicate the System Preferences options imo. I don't know that it's possible with BetterTouchTool (maybe it is?).
