Deleting all but the most recent Time Machine backup <body> I just bought a new Mac and I'm manually migrating everything over given that it's been a while since I did a clean install and that the new Mac has less storage than my existing one. I will be wiping the old Mac after I do the migration.  However, I have about 600GB worth of Time Machine backups for the old Mac on the NAS which I'd like to shrink to make space for Time Machine on the new Mac. I just want the latest Time Machine backup to serve as an archive in case I forget to move some files when I wipe the old Mac.  Is it possible to (easily) delete all but the latest snapshot of the Time Machine backup?   Thanks  <answer157174> Assuming OSX 10.8 or later, you could use a combination of strongfind/strong and strongtmutil/strong  codetmutil delete &lt;path&gt;/code will remove the snapshot at code&lt;path&gt;/code  while  codefind /path/to/backups/ -maxdepth 1/code will list all of your backup snapshots.  The last one ( strongLatest/strong ) is a link to the latest one.  You can be a little creative and use codefind /path/to/backups -name 2\* -maxdepth 1/code to list only the "real" directories (all the dates which start with 2014, etc).  And, finally, (thanks to this link) you can get a list of all but the last snapshot:  precodefind /path/to/backups -name 2\* -maxdepth 1 | sed \$d /code/pre  <comment184792> It might be easier to use `tmutil listbackups` to get a list of all snapshots (which then can get passed to `tmutil delete` directly) <comment184795> Good point-- I'll update the answer. Forgot about the listbackups command. <comment184796> But wait -- doesn't listbackups only work for the current machine and not another machines snapshots? <comment184810> Ah, maybe, can't try that though. <comment184972> I just set up a test here, and sure enough it only shows the current computer's snapshots.  `tmutil help listbackups` outputs "Print paths to all of **this computer's** completed backups" (emphasis added).  So, even though the find/sed flow is contrived, it may be the easiest way to do what the OP wants.
