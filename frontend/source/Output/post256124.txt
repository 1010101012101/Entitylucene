iPhone 6 Battery Problems, Dying at 40% <body> My iPhone is suddenly dying at 40% all the time and I don't know why. I have had my phone since Christmas 2014, it was working perfectly fine and know it is having this bug. I have been experiencing red and green lines across my iPhone and have been getting flitters of normal screen to plain black or grey and I am wondering if it is anything to do with my phone dying at 40%. Thanks!  <comment319286> Sounds like it either been dropped or it's got wet - I'd take it to an Apple Store to get it checked out.
