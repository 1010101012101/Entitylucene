Repair Disk failed <body> I try to repair a disk because my Mac still is on grey screen during start. I created a USB Yosemite bootable and I can use Terminal. I tried with:   precodediskutil repairvolume disk0s2 /code/pre  But I get the following error:     Underlying error: 8: POSIX reports: Exec format error   I don't want to format because I have a lot of documents and photos.  Here are the outputs of codediskutil list/code and codegpt -r show /dev/disk0/code:  precode-bash-3.2# diskutil list /dev/disk0    #:                    TYPE NAHE                  SIZE        IDENTIFIER            0:  GUID_partition_scheme                       *500.1 GB    disk0                 1:                    EFI EFI                    209.7 MB    disk0s1               2:              Apple_HFS Macintosh HD           499.8 GB    disk0s2            /dev/disk1                                                                         #:                    TYPE NAME                  SIZE        IDENTIFIER            0:   GUID_partition_scheme                       *8.1 GB    disk1                 1:                    EFI EFI                   209.7 MB    disk1s1               2:              Apple_HFS OS X Base System        7.7 GB    disk1s2            /dev/disk2-disk14 are temporary disks of the OS X Base System (disk1s2)  -bash-3.2# gpt -r show /dev/disk0                                                        start       size index contents                                                         0          1       PMBR                                                                   1          1       Pri GPT header                                                         2         32       Pri GPT table                                                         34          6                                                                       40     409600    1  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B            409640  976101344    2  GPT part - 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC        976510984     262151                                                                976773135         32       Sec GPT table                                            976773167          1       Sec GPT header   /code/pre  strongUPDATE/strong  I tried also this link but when I do  codefsck -fy/code  I Get codeExited With Signal 8/code                                          <comment250250> @klanomath http://postimg.org/image/fpnmcwlkl/ thanks <comment250255> @klanomath Do you mean my Usb bootable or my Hd ? <comment250259> @klanomath But I use Usb for use Recovery Hd, Maybe I don't understand sorry <comment250267> Usually you have a third partition with the size 1269536 blocks on disk0 which is your Recovery HD. How did you install your current system? Did you clone it form another Mac? <comment250268> @klanomath it isn't my mac, it is mac of my friend, and I don't think she clone another mac. Classic Installation, and I don't know which OS is on <comment250271> Can you mount disk0s2? `diskutil mount readOnly /dev/disk0s2` <comment250272> @klanomath Yes I can <comment250274> i made a mistake. First I have written disk0s1 but I meant disk0s2. Please repeat the command with disk0s2. <comment250275> I can't do it `diskutil mount readOnly /dev/disk0s2` failed to mount, If the volume is damaged, try the "readOnly" option <comment250276> Let us [continue this discussion in chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/29541/discussion-between-klanomath-and-barno).
