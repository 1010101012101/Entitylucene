Macbook 15" Mid-2015 - Wifi Occasionally Slow <body> I am encountering a weird issue regarding the Wi-Fi speeds on my (Apple Refurbished) Macbook 15" Mid-2015. On my home network, sometimes the wifi speeds would be extremely slow. I ran "ping google.com" in terminal and the ping times are 1000ms. The weird thing is that this rarely happens on my school network, only when it is connected to my home network is when this issue begins to arise.  Solutions attempted -   ul liSwitching between 2.4 and 5 Ghz networks. Issue still persists./li liDeleting a .plist file which stores wifi configuration information. Issue still persists./li liRemoving the Wi-Fi service in system preferences and added it back in. Issue still persists./li /ul  I have also tested if the problem exists on a ethernet connection, and it does not happen on it. Other Wi-Fi connected devices on the network never had this problem, even my old macbook didn't seem to have it aswell.  Macbook Specs -  ul liIntel Core i7 2.8Ghz/li li16GB 1600Mhz DDR3/li li1TB Flash Storage/li liIntel Iris and AMD graphics./li liOSX Sierra 10.12.5/li /ul  I might go to the apple store and see if it can be fixed there since it is still under warrenty.  Thanks  <comment361424> What kind of router do you have at home? If the speeds are fine at school, the laptop is probably not the issue. <comment361425> @WilliamTFroggard Linksys WRT1900ACS Dual-Band Gigabit Wifi Router <comment361426> Seems like a solid router. Do you live in a large metropolitan area? Sometimes wifi throughput can be higher or lower depending on congestion from other wifi networks nearby. <comment361429> @WilliamTFroggard I currently live in a small suburb. Here is the list of other wi-fi networks surrounding me at the moment: [Here](http://i.imgur.com/JmDFe2K.png) <comment361437> You can try manually changing channels on your router, and see if that helps things any. For the 2.4GHz band, you should only use channels 1, 6 and 11 (and if you happen to go to Japan, channel 14). You can try any channels on the 5GHz band.
