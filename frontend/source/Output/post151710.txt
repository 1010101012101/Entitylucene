iMovie 10.0.9 Won't load video <body> I have a camcorder hooked up to my iMac running iMovie 10.0.9. When I try to import the video, I get question marks, and then the HDD Camera clicks off the menu. How can I get the video into iMovie to edit?  <answer189363> Try using Mac's Image Capture (in Applications folder). Then import video to iPhoto instead of iMovie. Then iMovie will automatically import your video from iPhoto.   It's the long way around, I know, but it worked for me.  ul liDaniel/li /ul  <answer238667> It's impossible if your trying to convert another video that's already on your computer. This is unless you get Adobe Media Encoder which costs a ton of money.
