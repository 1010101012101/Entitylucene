2015 MBP doesn't want to wake up in the morning <body> Can you help me figure out why my MBP never wants to wake up in the morning? It's a Mid-2015 15in i7. I've looked around for similar posts but most are for older Macs and the solutions presented either don't apply or haven't worked.  I use the computer for work and have it connected to a cinema display. When I leave work I will sometimes tell it to sleep and sometimes just leave it on so Time Machine can do its work. Every morning when I arrive, I will try to wake it by hitting the space bar a couple times, moving the mouse, adjusting brightness, etc. But after a couple minutes both screens are still black. Sometimes I'll try unplugging the external display to see if the laptop screen will wake but no luck. If I close the lid and try to wake it like a normal laptop, nothing happens. Eventually I end up holding down the power button until it shuts off and reboots.  It's a fairly new computer so it's possible something I've installed has messed it up. I have a variety of things installed for work, like Postgres, Memcache, Redis, some Windows VMs, Backblaze, etc. However most of those aren't daemonized and are shut down at the end of the day. Below is the log from last night, starting after a point of inactivity at 9:58pm to me booting it at 9:03am by holding down the power button.   Let me know if there's any other useful information I can provide. Thanks for the help!  precode1/18/16 9:58:29.000 PM kernel[0]: Bluetooth -- LE is supported - Disable LE meta event 1/18/16 9:58:29.000 PM kernel[0]: AirPort: Link Down on awdl0.
