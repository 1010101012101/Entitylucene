Logged into Facebook app on two phones <body> I received a fb msg on phone B but cleared the notification. On phone A log in is only with Internet but notifications are on. I deleted the fb msg on phone B. But will phone A still receive the notification even though I cleared everything quickly?  <answer208744> You will receive the notification on all devices that have a connection and have notifications for Facebook enabled, regardless of whether you have since cleared the notification on another device.
