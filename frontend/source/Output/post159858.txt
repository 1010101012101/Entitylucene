How to upgrade to Yosemite without AppStore <body> I just can't add my credit card into Apple Id, I've tried hard, really.  I've manage to find a way how to install xcode, new iTunes and so on, but still not last OS upgrade. I've found information about downloading ISO and performing a clean install, but I don't want to loose my settings and everything.  Is is possible?  <answer159859> I have AppleID account without Credit Card.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xrhOS.jpg" alt="no credit card"  It works just fine in getting latest updates like Yosemite.  <comment187918> Damn it. No, really. Solution was that easy, but some manuals clearly said that you **can't** upgrade without confirmed credit card. Thanks.
