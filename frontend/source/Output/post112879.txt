CTRL scroll zoom on Mavericks gone <body> I used to be able to hold down kbdCTRL/kbd and zoom by scrolling the mousewheel, but that is not longer possible on Mavericks.  I've searched around and found many people saying it's in emSystem Preferences &rarr; Accessibility/em, typically accompanied by an image like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pZvdR.png" alt="Scroll gesture to zoom in Accesibility"  Unfortunately, that's not how my emAccessibility/em window looks. All I get is this (and no, it's not under emMore Options/em):img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2WYx8.png" alt="No scroll gesture to zoom in Accesibility"  Naturally, I tried searching in emSystem Preferences/em, too:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/obW9U.png" alt="Zoom search in System Preferences"  Excitedly, I click emMouse/em, just to get disappointed:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8Qk0g.png" alt="Mouse window in System Preferences"  There's nothing under emTrackpad/em, either:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EtdZ0.png" alt="Trackpad window in System Preferences"  So what's wrong? Where did it go? Why does it show up on emsome/em Mavericks installations, but not mine? I have the newest version of Maverick (10.9, 13A603) made from a clean installation. Can it be because other people have upgraded from a previous version of OS X that had the feature?  <answer113741> OS X thinks that the mouse you are using doesn't have a scroll wheel.  <answer118779> I've just spent several hours on chat and phone to Apple support about this issue on a brand new iMac, with a clean Mavericks installation and a three year old Mac Mini with an upgraded Mavericks installation.  The common thread between the two machines (neither of which show this missing option) is that they both have, or used to have, the Microsoft Intellitype/Intellipoint drivers.  My iMac is having issues forgetting about these drivers on boot/wake from sleep/when the moon is half-full, and it seems like maybe they've interfered with the way Mavericks determined the scroll ability of the mouse.  I started setting up the iMac with an Apple wireless magic mouse, but reverting to that doesn't make the option appear in Accessibility either.  Apple are escalating this to an engineering team: if I get any answers, I'll post back.  <answer127610> Press kbd⌘ command/kbd+kbd⌥ option/kbd+kbdF5/kbd, then select emEnable zoom scroll gestures/em.  <comment132511> You have the public version right? Not the beta version? Mine has the option to do that, and I have the public version. Maybe you could try restarting your computer and see if that would help <comment132516> Yes, I've downloaded it from App Store. I've had this installation for more than a mont, but I've previously just dismissed this minor inconvenience, so restarting won't help, I'm afraid. <comment132523> What kind of a Mac are you running Mavericks on? The only thing I can think of is that it's a hardware thing... in that your hardware configuration does not support this feature, therefore it will not be shown to you in System Preferences. Old Mac? Desktop? Laptop? Magic Trackpad? Etc... <comment132544> Did you install Mavericks from a clean disk or did you upgrade from your previous system ? I had a **lot** of issues until I format and re-install completely Mavericks (using a TimeMachine backup to recover my personnal data) <comment132568> @Sam I had the feature when I rean Mountain Lion, so it's not a hardware issue. Besides, it allows me to zoom using keyboard shortcuts and such, so it definitely can't be that. <comment132569> @lauhub Yes, it's a clean installation. <comment133394> what computer are you running kba? this on multiple systems? <comment133426> That seems to be the obvious explanation. Since the OP says there is a scroll wheel, it's not certain what brand mouse or how it connects from the current version of the question. @kba - Can you edit in your mouse hardware and whether the scroll button works normally? <comment133477> I'm using the Microsoft IntelliPoint driver and the scroll whell worls perfectly everywhere else (Chrome, Safari, Finder, Terminal, iTerm, etc.). Edit: My mouose is an Microsoft IntelliMouse 3.0. <comment138523> I do in fact have the Microsoft Mouse driver for my Microsoft IntelliPoint 3.0 mouse installed as evident from the screenshot in my post, so that seems very plausible. Thank you for your answer! <comment149565> I don't know why anybody would downvote this, because it does in fact work. Thank you! :) <comment152173> Perfect! ty.  (why does apple keep disabling my most used shortcuts!) <comment310155> Still a problem in 2016 on El Capitan and a standard, classing, CORRECT size HP optical scroll mouse (and no non-Apple drivers)
