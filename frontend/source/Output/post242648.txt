What is the "maybe" caller id suggestion in the call log based on? <body> I got a call from a phone number that is not stored in my address book, and in the call log, under the number, a name was suggested: "Maybe: X" (where X is the guessed name).  Where is this guess coming from?  <answer242649> This is part of the Proactivity features new with iOS 9. It looks at info in emails to make an educated guess at who's calling. See this Apple page for more info or here's the image of just that part: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZL4tz.jpg" alt=""  <answer242650> iOS scans your email for contact info.  If the phone number is not in your emAddress Book/em, for matches, it looks to your email to see if anyone with this number sent you email.  If it finds the phone number associated with a contact from your email, it will show you "Maybe:" with its guess of the person's name.  You can disable this feature, if you want, by:  ol liGo to emSettings -- Mail, Contacts, Calendars/em/li liUnder emContacts/em, toggle the switch labeled emContacts Found in Mail/em to the emOFF/em position/li /ol  <answer257021> ol liSettings /li liGeneral/li liMessaging/li liTurn on group messages. /li /ol  Then :   ol liSettings/li liGeneral/li liReset/li liReset network settings/li /ol  then delete the thread that was causing issues and restart conversation  <answer268613> If you want to turn off this feature: For iOS 10  go to settings  contacts  Contacts found in Apps  turn off   <comment324356> This question is about the call log, not conversations in Messages.
