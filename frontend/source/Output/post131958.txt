The best advice is to go to an Apple store or an Apple Authorized Service Provider and let them look at it.  The issue could be your battery, it could be the MagSafe board or it could be the logic board.  I wish I could help you more but without seeing the unit with my own eyes and taking it apart I can't say for certain what it is. I doubt it is software and therefore encourage you to reach out and find someone who is certified to open Macs.   <answer142466> If there is no light.  ul liChange your charger./li liClean your charger and laptop connectors./li liGo to Apple Genius Bar./li /ul  hr  If there is a light.  ul liGo to the Apple in the upper left corner and select strongAbout This Mac/strong, then click on strongMore Info/strong (and then strongSystem Report/strong if you are running 10.7 Lion, 10.8 Mountain Lion or 10.9 Mavericks), then select strongPower/strong from the left hand column of the strongSystem Profiler/strong.

Saying it is hardware rather than software isn't entirely vague but I can't test his hardware now can I? It has to be done by someone else and so I gave him the tools to find someone who can. Also, at least I gave an answer rather than just a comment. My answer is based off of experience and the info provided in OP and comments. <comment155135> It is not more important what the OP thinks about your answer. This is a public place not a personal conversation. In addition your answer would be viewed by others seeking similar help. I explained why the negative vote, while I did not had to do that and could have staid anonymous. So take my feed back as is -well meant. <comment155210> This is largely caused by hardware issues and I think this answer is accurate for the OP considering he doesn’t know what to do in this situation (in worst case, assuming software’s fault). Better take the machine for the certified Apple Genius to check and avoid needless tinkering. <comment155337> Thanks @sayzlim, appreciate the up! <comment157108> So I took my MacAir to Apple Genius Bar. Turn out there was a problem with MagSafe board. They replaced it for me and everything is working fine now. Thank @Buscar웃 ... <comment157109> and @AndrewU.
