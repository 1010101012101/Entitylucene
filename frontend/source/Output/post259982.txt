How to wake up a process marked "sleeping" <body> I'm building a project using cmake, but after awhile cmake pauses and won't continue generating. When I look at the process using the codetop/code command, here's what the relevant lines look like:  precode17489  xcodebuild   0.0  00:00.63 6     3    85    31M    0B     0B     10374 10374 sleeping 10374  cmake        0.0  00:21.12 1     0    10    4580K  0B     0B     10374 461   sleeping /code/pre  If you scroll to the right, you can see that they're both "sleeping."  So, my question is, how do I "wake up" a sleeping process??
