How to Screen Capture while in Cmd+Tab <body> I ran into a rare situation - I want to snag a picture of my screen while using codecmd+tab/code to show people how I navigate around in this how-to post.   The regular codecmd+shift+3/code or code4/code didn't do anything. Thoughts on getting around it?   I run lion 10.8.3 on a MBA.  <answer96797> Open Grab, go to Capture - Timed Screen, then make sure the cmd+tab module is up on the screen when the timer runs out. Then open in Preview and crop as desired.  <answer96823> precodescreencapture -T 5 /tmp/screencapture.png # 5 second delay screencapture -T 5 -cC # -c copies to clipboard, -C includes a cursor screencapture -T 5 -ic # -i (interactive mode) is like shift-command-4 /code/pre  I also use a function like this:  precodescreencaps() {   while :; do     screencapture -C ~/Desktop/$(date +%y%m%d%H%M%S).png     sleep ${1-1}   done } /code/pre  <comment113612> I'm noticing a bit of a trend here ;)
