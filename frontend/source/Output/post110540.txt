Command line open pkg <body> I am trying to write an app that will trigger an pkg to open so the user can install this. I have the code and it is working well except for the following.  When I try to open the pkg file using codeopen /tmp/mypackage.pkg/code in most cases it will open the Finder to the users home folder not the package.  I have checked and the package is present within the specified directory and the application is creating the correct command.  The command i am using to do this is in python:  precodesubprocess.Popen(['open', '/tmp/mypackage.pkg']) application.close() /code/pre  <answer110543> From the command line you could use  precodesudo installer -pkg /tmp/mypackage.pkg -target / /code/pre  I assume you can incorporate this into your python application.  <comment130197> I want to be able to use open only becuase I want to show the installer UI to the user.
