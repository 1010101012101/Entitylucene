Make OS X Dashboard Widgets appear in Desktop <body> Dashboard Widgets would be much more useful as MenuBar apps, but some aren't. Is there a way to force OS X to display active Widgets in the MenuBar or as application windows?   <answer178212> With WidgetRunner you can run OS X widgets as desktop apps, but not menu bar apps.  <comment210369> No. Widgets and menu bar icons are programmed differently. Any widget that happens to have a menu bar icon is because the programmer chose to do so. <comment211150> Great tip. This is exactly what I was looking for. <comment211378> I also found that under System Preferences â†’ Mission Control, there's a setting for displaying Dashboard "As Overlay", which is a step in the direction I want to go.
