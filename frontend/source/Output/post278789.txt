Fixing Night Shift incompatibility with external monitors <body> If you use an external monitor for your Mac of any shape or size and recently updated to macOS Sierra 10.12.4, chances are you've had some trouble with Night Shift.   Common issues include:  ul lithe inability to configure Night Shift from your external monitor/li liNight Shift being impossible to disable (as a result of the former)/li lia substantial loss of colour quality (as a result of both of the former happening at once on some connection or screen types, most commonly DVI-D to VGA, DisplayPort, and LCD screens of all kinds.)/li /ul  How do you get past these issues? Is there a way to enable access to the Night Shift pane on any display?  <answer278790> After two days of searching, I've found a solution that allows users to get past the Night Shift incompatibility issues with external monitors. This solution helps to enable access to Night Shift on any display.  ol liConnect your external monitor, disable your internal monitor, and make sure your external monitor is set as the default./li listrongDownload required files./strong You will need two programs (and a third optional) to proceed. The first is FixEDID, which can be found here: FixEDID, the second is DarwinDumper and can be found here: DarwinDumper, and the final (optional) one is KextWizard, found here: KextWizard/li liOpen FixEDID, wait for the fields to auto-load, and minimize FixEDID, do not close it./li liOpen DarwinDumper, click emDeselect All/em, check the EDID box, and click emRun/em. You will be prompted for your password, and the dump directory will auto-open when it is done. Close DarwinDumper, and copy emEDID.bin/em to your desktop./li liUnminimize FixEDID, click emOpen EDID Binary File/em, select your emEDID.bin/em. Now in the drop down menu under that button choose the internal monitor for your model of Mac (this will usually be the first option), and click the emMake/em button. You should have a few new files now, but you can ignore all of them except emDisplayMergeNub.kext/em, which you will need./li li(emKext Wizard Version/em) Open Kext Wizard, click the emInstallation/em tab, click emBrowse/em, choose emDisplayMergeNub.kext/em, and click emInstall/em. You will be asked for your password. Once it has finished reboot your Mac./li li(emManual Installation/em) Open Terminal.app and run the following command codesudo mv $(whoami)/Desktop/DisplayMergeNub.kext /System/Library/Extensions/ &amp;&amp; sudo reboot/code. You will be asked for your password, and your Mac will automatically reboot as soon as the operation finishes./li liUpon rebooting you can go to Apple  About This Mac and under the Displays tab you will find your Mac now considers your external monitor to be your internal monitor, as a result Night Shift should not be auto enabled anymore, and you can now access the Night Shift preference pane from Settings. /li /ol  strongemA Quick Note/em/strong   For those who want to reverse this process so that your external monitor is no longer considered a built-in display by your Mac, you can simply run the command codesudo rm /System/Library/Extensions/DisplayMergeNub.kext &amp;&amp; sudo reboot/code.   As with the previous command this will ask for your password, and automatically reboot your Mac after the process is finished.  <answer280330> Download Flux. It reliably works on both internal and external monitors.  <comment350894> Thanks for your question and answer! :) Is this a guide you've put together yourself, or have you obtained it from another source? If another source, it'd be good to cite your source (and maybe include a link). <comment350896> @Monomeeth, I found *FixEDID* mentioned on TonyMacx86, while I was looking for a solution to the issue. There were some instructions on the site it was originally posted on (insanelymac) and the mention of it in this context. However it took me a good two days to find this programme so I decided to make a formal guide with a concise title to hopefully save people all that time searching. There was also a version of DarwinDumper that didn't work on the newest version of Sierra so I decided it best to also link the version that I know does, and a programme for convenient installation. <comment350897> That's great, good job! :) I've taken the liberty of editing your question and answer just so it followed the Q&A format a little better and _hopefully_ makes it a little easier to follow. Please correct anything I may have inadvertently stuffed up in the process. Thanks again! :) <comment352807> Flux conflicts with Night Shift and causes additional issues, and installing it would in fact only make the situation worse (I tried, it did.). It should also be noted that Flux is in no way capable of fixing system level incompatibilities between Night Shift and the macOS external display handler. This is neither a solution to the main problem (inability to access or change Night Shift settings from an external monitor) nor the main symptoms (Night Shift being perpetually enabled on external monitors, or scheduling not working on internal monitors on a Mac using external display). <comment354149> Thanks for all the effort; this worked for me. <comment356629> This did not work for me. In clamshell mode, external display still shows 'warm' display, with no way to turn it off. Also, I would add in step 4 that one should manually set the output directory; on my machine there were permission errors as DarwinDumper attempted to write to a locked directory. <comment359074> user3071284 Happy to help :). @Ze'ev I tested this on an iMac, so I had never taken a closed lid into account, if possible make sure that you set the Mac not to respond to the lid being close, that way it won't register the mode change and should continue to function properly when the lid is closed. As for FixEDID's output directory I had exactly the same problem as you but with a different version of the programme. I would recommend simply trying a different release of FixEDID, as far as I can tell the issue arises due to minor changes in permission handling in different versions of macOS. <comment359117> @AlisonE.E. How would you "make sure that you set the Mac to not respond to the lid being closed" ? <comment359588> @Ze'ev I don't own a MacBook newer than a decade old, I assumed that option was added into the display panel at some point since 10.6. If it doesn't exist there are probably built-in settings that can be modified via Terminal to achieve this, if not there are definitely 3rd party solutions. Try your favourite search engine.
