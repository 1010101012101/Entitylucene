What exact screen is showing an error message. Can you navigate to the settings app and choose reset, erase all content and settings? <comment133581> Here are some specific questions you need to answer for us to help you: 1. What version of iOS is it running? It's listed under SettingsGeneralAbout This matters a lot if it is iOS 7 and Find My iPhone is enabled. 2. Do you have a Mac or PC running the current version of iTunes and the USB docking cable? You will need this. If it's running iOS 7 and Find My iPhone is enabled under SettingsiCloud you may be out of luck. That configuration is a new security mode that will resist attempts to use all the device's features and reset attempts. We need to know more.
