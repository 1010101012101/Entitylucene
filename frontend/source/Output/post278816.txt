How can I go back to 10.12.3 without using a Time Machine backup? <body> I have mid 2014 MBP. Sierra 10.12.4 just destroyed my laptop's Wifi. After the laptop resumes from sleep, it will not connect to a Wifi network again.   Initially I thought it was a corrupt file or something, so I reformatted the computer and ran a clean installation of 10.12.4.   It worked for a few hours. After the laptop went to sleep, the problem recurred. The laptop can see all Wifi networks but won't connect to any of them.   I don't use Time Machine for backups, instead, I zip and copy my data folders as a backup strategy.   Since the problem with the Wifi is clearly with 10.12.4, I have to go back to a previous version.   How can I do download a copy of 10.12.3 or earlier?   Here's a link to my previous question which may offer some more detail about why I need to do this.   Thanks for any advice.
