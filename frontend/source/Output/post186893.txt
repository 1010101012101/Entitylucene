OS X 10.9: where are password hashes stored <body> I think on previous versions of OS X, password were stored in the /etc/shadow file.  Nevertheless, this file doesn't appear to exist in the later versions of the operating system - specifically OS X 10.9 which is the first of the non-cat named OS releases.  Does anyone know where the password hashes are stored on OS X Mavericks?  <answer186899> Starting with Lion, OS X introduced a shadow file emper user/em that is a plist dictionary that contains password hashes and other GID/UID/kerberos and open directory type keys.   The shadow files are stored on the filesystem at code/var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/users/code. They are in plist format so you'll need to use the plutil command to view them or use the defaults command to extract/write specific keys if desired. Only the coderoot/code user has access to the files.  To view the contents of a shadow file for a user:  precodesudo plutil -p /var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/users/&lt;username&gt;.plist /code/pre  To get the hash:  precodesudo defaults read /var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/users/&lt;username&gt;.plist ShadowHashData|tr -dc 0-9a-f|xxd -r -p|plutil -convert xml1 - -o - /code/pre  Where code&lt;username&gt;/code in the above examples is the user you're looking for the hash for. You want the code&lt;data&gt;/code section that corresponds to the code&lt;key&gt;entropy&lt;/key&gt;/code key in that plist output.  To continue on to try and crack the password see this tutorial.  <answer186900> I looked it up on Google and found this: http://hackmac.org/forum/topic/2678-ceacking-os-x-mountain-lion-os-x-mavericks-os-x-yosemite-account-password  <comment281646> This is not working for me: it says that ShadowHashData is not a valid property in username.plist... <comment281740> @MarkWright what OS X version? Works great for me on 10.11.3. Are you using LDAP for the accounts or is it a local account? <comment281751> I am using 10.9 on single user mode. <comment281786> What does `sudo defaults read /var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/users/${USER}.plist` show for you? <comment288068> @MarkWright same happened to me osx:10.10.5 Using that command returns "Domain /var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/users/${USER}.plist does not exist"
