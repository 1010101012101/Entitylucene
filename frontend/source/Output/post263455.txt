iMac's files & apps deleted without user input, operating system reinstalled on reboot <body> I left my iMac on overnight, as I was copying some files between sd cards (one was via a usb hub). The following morning, today, at some point I realized that many apps I had downloaded had been deleted, as well as basically all files that had been added by me, especially in my home directory. I only noticed when I saw my iTunes library pointed to nonexistent files.  Oddly, all the files on my sd cards as well as an additional attached usb drive were deleted. While exceedingly annoying, I doubt anything too critical was lost. At some point, I wasn't sure how to proceed, so I rebooted the computer. (I actually used the computer for several hours on firefox, which is one application that was removed from the system, so I'm not sure how I was able to continue using it when the underlying files and data were evidently removed).   Once I rebooted, I saw that some pieces of the operating system were still intact, like some apps downloaded from the internet, and my username and password, for example, and the positioning of emsome/em apps in the dock. So some configuration info was saved, and yet the data mounted in the /Volumes directory was all deleted.  What I was doing last night on the computer was light web browsing, downloading of zip files from the internet, and some stuff via the command line like using the dd command to move a zip file, and cp to move data between sd cards. I wonder if the output file in my dd command was incorrect (/dev/disk1), but I doubt it and don't know why that would prompt a reinstall.  I was using Sierra before the reboot and am at 10.12.1 now.  Can provide more detail as needed.
