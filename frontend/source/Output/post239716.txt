Can't delete keychain items with UI, but command line works fine <body> When using the codeKeychain Access/code app, I am often unable to delete an codeWeb form password/code item. I have tried hitting the codedelete/code key and going to codeEdit/code  codeDelete/code. In both cases, nothing happens, there is no error message.  I can delete the item if I use the command line version of the tool:  precode$ security find-internet-password -a "foo@example.com" keychain: "/Users/simon/Library/Keychains/woodside-mbp.keychain" version: 256 class: "inet" attributes:     0x00000007 &lt;blob&gt;="daw.apple.com (foo@example.com)"     0x00000008 &lt;blob&gt;=&lt;NULL&gt;     "acct"&lt;blob&gt;="foo@example.com"     "atyp"&lt;blob&gt;="form"     ... $ security delete-internet-password -a "foo@example.com" keychain: "/Users/simon/Library/Keychains/woodside-mbp.keychain" version: 256 class: "inet" attributes:     0x00000007 &lt;blob&gt;="daw.apple.com (foo@example.com)"     0x00000008 &lt;blob&gt;=&lt;NULL&gt;     "acct"&lt;blob&gt;="foo@example.com"     "atyp"&lt;blob&gt;="form"     ... password has been deleted. /code/pre  If I now redo the search in Keychain Access, the item is gone.  I am running El Capitan 10.11.4 (15E65), Keychain Access Version 9.0 (55171.20.2), and   <comment294305> In the Keychain Access application, does the keychain you are trying to delete from (e.g., login, Local Items, or System) show a locked padlock icon next to it? If so, try clicking the padlock icon in the upper-left corner, entering your password, then trying to delete it again. <comment294311> @PseudoSu: the keychain is unlocked.
