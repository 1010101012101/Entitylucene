Getting compilations to display properly in iTunes <body> I was wondering if I could have some help with getting compilation albums to display properly in iTunes. I'm aware that this is something a lot of people have asked about in the past, but I've read some suggested solutions and none are helping me get quite what I want.   Basically, what I would like is for a compilation album to be displayed as one album (rather than displaying multiple copies split by artist) BUT also have the individual tracks from a compilation by a particular artist displayed under the list for that artist. No matter what I do it seems I have to pick one or the other, and I was hoping there was a way to get both. So for example for this track, which is the first in my long list of compilations:  Title: When the Going Gets Tough Album: Now 42 Artist: Boyzone  I'd like Now 42 to display as a single album in the album listing, but I'd also like for just this track (not the rest of the album) to display under Boyzone in the artist listing.   I've read the various articles on ticking "Part of a compilation", "Display compilations together" etc. For me these options don't do anything, ticked or unticked. It will always display multiple Now 42s divided by artist when in Album view, but the different tracks will display fine under different artists just the way I want them to.   If I set the album artist as the same for all tracks (e.g. "Various Artists") then I get a single copy of "Now 42" in the album view, which is great. However then (for example) 'When the Going Gets Tough' disappears from the Boyzone artist view.   Is there any way of achieving both things, or do I need to choose between them? Or is there something wrong with my iTunes? I have version 11.1.3 running on Windows 7.   Any help would be much appreciated!!  Edit: By the way it also makes no difference using the 'Sort Album', 'Sort Artist' fields either.
