Can't delete partitions after attempting BOOTCAMP on my iMac 5k <body> I recently tried to install a bootcamp instance of Win 7. The install failed for some reason. This left me with a partition that I can not access via Disk Utility img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YE0oI.png" alt="enter image description here"  If you notice..the +- can not be selected and hence I can't delete the partition and recover the space on my drive  I tried to follow the instructions posted here by klanomath but have had no success.  It could be because I have 2 CoreStorage logical volume groups about which I have no clue as to what it is  Klanomath...can you please help me out???  diskutil list--  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VsdFp.png" alt="diskutil list"   diskutil cs list--  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oMhQV.png" alt="diskutil cs list"  sudo gpt -r -vv /dev/disk1--  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IH9r0.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer173550> Something went totally wrong and your Logical Volume Group is fragmented. You have to rebuild your Fusion Drive from scratch:  strongPreparation:/strong  ul liBackup "Macintosh HD" to an external drive with Time Machine/li liDetach any external drive (especially your external Time Machine backup drive)/li liRestart to Internet Recovery Mode by pressing kbdalt/kbd kbdcmd/kbd kbdR/kbd at startup.br The prerequisites are the latest firmware update installed, either ethernet or WLAN (WPA/WPA2) and a router with DHCP activated.br On a 50 Mbps-line it takes about 5 min (presenting a small animated globe) to boot into a recovery netboot image which usually is loaded from an apple/akamai server.  I recommend ethernet because it's more reliable. If you are restricted to WIFI and the boot process fails, just restart your Mac until you succeed booting.  Alternatively you may start from a bootable installer thumb drive (Yosemite) or a thumb drive containing a full system (Yosemite)./li /ul  strongRebuild Fusion Drive/strong    ul liBooted to Internet Recovery Mode open Utilities â†’ Terminal in the menubar and enter:br codediskutil cs list/code to get the CoreStorage listing.  /li liCopy the second Logical Volume Group UUID, it's the seventh listed in the listing of codediskutil cs list/code.  /li liThen delete the second Logical Volume Group with codediskutil cs delete LVG2UUID/code.br In your case: codediskutil cs delete E0E4516A-DE3A-4B62-BE6A-855A760F5E3E/code/li liCopy the Logical Volume UUID it's the sixth UUID listed/li lidelete the Logical Volume with codediskutil cs deleteVolume LVUUID/code.br In your case: codediskutil cs deleteVolume 00CDC215-F00D-4AD4-BA78-A2B220278688/code/li liCopy the first Logical Volume Group UUID, it's the first listed in the listing of codediskutil cs list/code.  /li liThen delete the first Logical Volume Group with codediskutil cs delete LVGUUID/code.br In your case: codediskutil cs delete 8FCBCB92-43CC-45A2-A058-58CAF79B93B4/code/li liEnter codeexit/code and quit 'Terminal'/li liOpen 'Disk Utility'.

A question to you, do you have 2 OS X versions installed ? <comment204141> No, I don't think so. Just running Yosemite. I transferred data from my MBP Retina to this new iMac 5k and that's about it <comment204143> you see what I see and it shows 2 OS X partitions and one bootcamp. <comment204173> Yes I do..sorry for the late reply. This happened when I tried to use BootCamp <comment204174> Prior to installing BootCamp the disk utility showed nothing abnormal. While trying to install Windows, which never happened due to some formatting issue when I came back to DU to delete the partition I found it in this state <comment204176> @klanomath thank you for helping me out. Yes I have a 50mb fibre optic connection at home. Don't have a Yosemite thumb drive though <comment204209> After you have restored your computer using klanomath's instructions, do you still intend to install Windows 7? <comment204221> @DavidAnderson Not until Apple comes up with a BootCamp that wont break my fusiondrive <comment204654> FYI, it isn't that the mods personally don't like extended commenting, it's that the system isn't set up for it. <comment204655> @DanielLawson Ok next time i will use that as explanation ;-)
