Locally-hosted websites made available over the internet via port forwarding much slower after upgrading to Sierra <body> For a long time now I've been using Dyn.com's Host Service with port forwarding to make websites hosted on my laptop served via MAMP available over the Internet to people outside my network.  Last week I upgraded my laptop from Yosemite to Sierra and since then the speed at which my sites download outside my network has slowed down dramatically with a lot of site assets failing to load completely leading to broken pages.  The only thing that's changed in the past week has been the OS so is there any configuration changes that were added with Sierra that I need to look into?
