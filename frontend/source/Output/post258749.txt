Samba shares from Linux appear twice in MacOS X <body> I have a local Linux (Debian) server with Samba running. Manually connecting via smb://local works as it should. For automounting I connected to my Samba (with save password option) and added my smb://local/share and smb://local/public to my startup items.   On system boot my Mac mounts to Samba twice (share and share-1 / public and public-1).  df:  precode//stefan@local/share     405989968  255855036  150134932    64% 255855034 150134932   63%   /Volumes/share //stefan@local/share     405989968  255855036  150134932    64% 255855034 150134932   63%   /Volumes/share-1 //stefan@local/public    405989968  255855036  150134932    64% 255855034 150134932   63%   /Volumes/public //stefan@local/public    405989968  255855036  150134932    64% 255855034 150134932   63%   /Volumes/public-1 /code/pre  This is my smb.conf on Debian:  precode[global] workgroup = ARBEITSGRUPPE server string = %h server wins support = yes dns proxy = no security = user encrypt passwords = true passdb backend = tdbsam obey pam restrictions = yes load printers = no printcap name = /dev/null domain master = yes valid users = %S [share]     comment = Webs     path= /var/www     writeable = yes     browseable = yes     user = stefan     valid users = stefan stefansl     guest ok = yes     create mode = 0755     force user = stefan     force group = stefan [public]     comment = Kunden     path= /home/stefan     writeable = yes     browseable = yes     user = stefan     valid users = stefan     guest ok = yes     create mode = 0755 /code/pre  I have no idea, where to search for the problem. Is it on the Linux machine or on my Mac client?
