How can I use the "signature" function in Preview on Mac Mini with no camera? <body> I have a Mac Mini with no attached camera. I would like to use the feature of Preview that allows you to insert a signature. This relies on taking an image of your signature using an isight/facetime/webcam. I do not have on.  I do have a MacBook pro on which I use the signature function. Is there a way to copy a file from the the MacBook Pro to the Mac Mini to enable this function on the Mini?  Thanks.  Ken  <answer61439> You apparently can transfer the signature from your Macbook to your Mac Mini.

If you run into any problems feel free to ask.   <comment70938> No problem Ken! :)
