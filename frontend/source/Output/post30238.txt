How to enable OS X screen sharing (VNC) through SSH? <body> I forgot to turn on "VNC viewers may control screen with password", to enter on my working Mac, is there way to turn-on this feature remotely via SSH (I'm on WindowsXP now)?  <answer30239> Source: http://technotes.twosmallcoins.com/?p=279 br /  Putty is a good SSH client for Windows.  1)  SSH into your remote OS X machine with an administrator’s log in and password.  2) Enable Remote Desktop (a.k.a. Screen Sharing, a.k.a. VNC) with this command:  precodesudo  /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ARDAgent.app/Contents/Resources/kickstart -activate -configure -access -on -clientopts -setvnclegacy -vnclegacy yes -clientopts -setvncpw -vncpw mypasswd -restart -agent -privs -all /code/pre  3) Login using a VNC client. As I mentioned, TightVNC worked for me; for some reason, RealVNC and UltraVNC didn’t.  Your password is “mypasswd” (see the -vncpw flag in the above command;  you can emand should/em change this).  4) When you are done, turn of screen sharing using your SSH session:  precodesudo /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ARDAgent.app/Contents/Resources/kickstart -deactivate -configure -access -off /code/pre  <answer73919> Here is a different way that enables screen sharing access all current users, instead of using a single vnc password;  precodesudo  /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ARDAgent.app/Contents/Resources/kickstart -activate -configure -access -on -configure -allowAccessFor -allUsers -configure -restart -agent -privs -all /code/pre  Disable the same as before.  This allows you to connect to the remote computer from a mac using the codeshare screen/code button in Finder.  Reference: http://ss64.com/osx/kickstart.html  <comment34690> Amazing! Works! <comment34694> One thing that Mac RD quite unusable for me (very slowly)... as opossed to windows RDC, which is pretty good. <comment34695> Have you tried Vine Server? <comment34696> I've never worked with VNC before. Only with SSH once to let my desktop start downloading a file upstairs in my room so that my laptop didn't have to keep running in the living room :p <comment108452> For posterity: if you do this, you can also connect via `/System/Library/CoreServices/Screen Sharing.app`. <comment204750> 3+ years later and works perfectly in Yosemite. Thanks! <comment252666> What if I I'm on mac and want to enable screen sharing with linux? (so no putty there). What can I do? <comment284603> Warning: this breaks with the "Remote Desktop Client Update v3.8.5" update. See here: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7501620?start=15&tstart=0 <comment289756> ... and the fix is here: https://discussions.apple.com/message/30088844#30088844 - download older RemoteManagement folder and replace the current, broken one with it.

No need for a separate package like you need on Windows. <comment304841> TigerVNC worked for me on this. Vinagre, unfortunately, did not (it requires entering the username). <comment325795> Note that you can (very) easily launch the Screen Sharing app using a Spotlight search <comment362711> Would be helpful to disable not screen sharing, but only the VNC option <comment367851> doesn't work for me on macOS Sierra 10.12
