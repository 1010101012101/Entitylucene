Are there Greasemonkey scripts for Safari? <body> There's the wonderful Greasemonkey to run user-defined JavaScript on web pages.  Is there such a thing as Greasemonkey for Safari? Or would one instead write a Safari Extension to customize behavior on other web pages? Maybe there's an alternative that runs on AppleScript instead of JavaScript?  <answer6955>    Is there such a thing as Greasemonkey for Safari?   You can use SIMBL and GreaseKit to run most Greasemonkey scripts in Safari, unmodified. Detailed installation instructions are found at this link, repeated here:  ol liDownload and install SIMBL/li liQuit Safari/li liDownload GreaseKit/li liDrag the GreaseKit.bundle file to code~/Library/Application Support/SIMBL/Plugins/code. You may need to create this location if it doesn't exit/li liStart Safari and you'll see a strongGreaseKit/strong menu bar item/li liInstall scripts from http://userscripts.org -- the installation process is a little different from the Firefox approach, but it works./li /ol     Or would one instead write a Safari Extension to customize behavior on other web pages? Maybe there's an alternative that runs on AppleScript instead of JavaScript?   The native-to-Safari equivalent of Greasemonkey is AppleScript extensions and plugins. For a nice library of native Safari extensions check out Pimp My Safari.  <answer6956> The best place to start is probably going to be here: http://developer.apple.com/devcenter/safari/index.action  I've seen safari extensions whose only behavior was to customize behavior of web sites; just yesterday I saw one that changed the layout of reddit to be more iOS-friendly.  here it is.  <answer6980> Another option to run GreaseMonkey scripts is NinjaKit (which is what I use). It's a Safari 5 extension, which means it's just a tad safer than GreaseKit.  <answer222579> I use TamperMonkey and it works surprisingly well. It's also a Safari Extension.  I have tried used NinjaKit in the past but it no longer works for me, a lot of scripts simply won't work.  <comment7426> This seems like a good thing, but I can't find any documentation – and the one script I tried did not work (it works in Greasemonkey/Firefox; it's Facebook Autopoke) <comment7427> SIMBL will force me to use 32bit Safari – anything that this causes problems with? <comment7430> Have you tried [NinjaKit](https://bitbucket.org/os0x/ninjakit/overview) (@Dori's suggestion)? It looks to be based on S5, so newer framework. <comment7436> @d'ombre - yeah, the author's Japanese, so the English docs are minimal. There's a [little bit here](http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?u=http://d.hatena.ne.jp/os0x/searchdiary%3Fword%3D*%255BNinjaKit%255D) which might be some help. So far as individual scripts go, most work, but yes, some don't. For FB, Unfriend Finder works for me, so it may just be an Autopoke issue.
