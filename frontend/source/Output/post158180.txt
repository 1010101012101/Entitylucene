iTunes hangs at "Step 6 of 7. Importing photos" <body> Everytime I connect my iPhone (4 or 5) to iTunes (v. 12.0.1.26), it begins syncing but hangs on step 6 of 7, "Importing photos".   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yHmnH.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer158383> ol liQuit iTunes/li liDelete code~/Pictures/iPod Photo Cache/code (may or may not exist)/li liGo to `~/Pictures/iPhoto Library/li liCTRL+click  Show Package Contents/li liDelete codeiPod Photo Cache/code inside the library /li liTry syncing again./li /ol  Worked for me.  <comment185979> iTunes doesn't import photos, it only exports them. iPhoto imports them.... unless i missed a meeting;-) <comment186014> I meant importing photos from iPhoto <comment186016> then could you clarify your question? Use the edit button just underneath. <comment196622> For anyone else finding this post, the above answer worked for me, even though I had to skip step 2 since I didn't have a cache at that location (OSX 10.10).
