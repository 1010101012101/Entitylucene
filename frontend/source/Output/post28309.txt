Correct syntax for bash grep function? <body> I'm trying to set up a function to make certain grep command easier.  precodegr() { grep -r --include=*.\{m,h,xib\} $1 \* ; } /code/pre  The end result should be a recursive grep of all code*.m/code, code*.h/code, and code*.xib/code files, for whatever is specified by the command's argument:  precode$ gr SearchText /code/pre  Can anyone demonstrate the correct syntax for this?  <answer28310> Nevermind; thought I had tried everything I could imagine; turns out I was just over-zealous with escaping special characters from the shell. The syntax I was looking for is:  precodegr() { grep -r --include=*.{m,h,xib} "$1" * ; } /code/pre
