How to recover my texts on Pages? <body> I just made a big silly mistake in the newest Pages Version on Mac air, I clicked "setup", then I clicked "Document Body", and then Pages asked me"Are you sure you want to remove the body of the document?",and I said "Yes",and all my stuff just disappeared. There was nothing left.  And I quickly quit the Pages, hoping that there will be a sign asking me "Are you going to save the changes?" and I will click "No"  But such thing did not happen.  How can I recover my texts now?   <answer107811> I found the answer.  strongFile/strong → strongRevert to/strong → strongBrowse All Versions/strong, and there you go.
