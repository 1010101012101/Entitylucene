Typing a key through terminal <body> I have been using SSH to connect from my laptop to my iMac. I want to completely control my mac from another room. I was wondering if it is possible to make the mac think I pressed a key when I actually did not. I want the key to appear. Is there a command such as   precode    keypress w /code/pre  (just made that command up) that can be used to type?  <comment355467> applescript supports stuff like this do you mean key code? <comment355820> See https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/36943/how-do-i-automate-a-key-press-in-applescript
