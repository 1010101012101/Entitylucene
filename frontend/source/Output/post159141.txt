What video connector for a mid-2012 macbook pro to External Monitor <body> What are the different (and the best) option for connecting my mid 2012 Macbook pro to an external monitor. Three connections I know of are VGA, HDMI and DVI. What is the difference and what cables do I need? Are there any other options I can consider? Are there any adaptors that let me switch between VGA and DVI?  <answer159148> The best connector is obviously one which matches your monitor.  If you are getting a new monitor, most now use codeHDMI/code.  HDMI and DVI-D are very similar, and dual adaptors are common. The main difference is lack of sound on DVI.  codeVGA/code is an analog connection, and effectively obsolete, but you can get VGA adaptors for a Mac.  <comment187110> DisplayPort. Your machine will have either Thunderbolt or Mini DisplayPort; either will work to a DisplayPort connection.
