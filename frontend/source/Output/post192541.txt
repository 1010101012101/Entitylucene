How do you get a list of all your Game Center accounts? <body> I need to know what the original account was for my Clash of Clans is so I may transfer to another device. Any suggestions? I have tried multiple times trying to find through my emails with no luck. Can Game Center email a list of my CoC account?  <answer192546> The Gamecenter tokens are saved in your keychain.  Open it in search for it (Game). It will list all accounts you have.  precodecom.apple.account.AppleID.appleid-token-gamecenter /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/d47DA.jpg" alt="game"  <comment229102> Please use tags relevant to the content of the question.
