Unknown Calendar: where does it come from? <body> Within Calendar (6.0) on Mountain Lion, beside my own 12 calendars, I noticed a calendar named codeCalendar/code.  I didn't create it. All my calendars are coming from a recent migration from Snow Leopard to Mountain Lion.  Where does this codeCalendar/code come from? Is this a codedefault/code calendar automatically created by codeCalendar/code (the application)?  Through an export (under codeics/code format) I discovered that it is empty.  I'd like to remove this abnormal codeCalendar/code.  Does anyone know if this default calendar is necessary for one of the codeCalendar/code functions?  <answer103419> Looking at the directories:  precode~/Library/Calendars/*.calendar /code/pre  where all calendars are stored, the command:  precodegrep string ~/Library/Calendars/*.calendar /code/pre  let me identify among the 4 strings found, which one of these directories was the one containing my codeCalendar/code ghost calendar:  precode    [...]     &lt;string&gt;#0E61B9FF&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;string&gt;22228888-4444-6666-AFAF-AAFF00005555&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;string&gt;Calendar&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;string&gt;Local&lt;/string&gt;     [...] /code/pre  From the date of modification of directory:  precode% ls -l 22228888-4444-6666-AFAF-AAFF00005555.calendar drwx------  4 hal  hal  170 Sep 21 17:10 22228888-4444-6666-AFAF-AAFF00005555.calendar % /code/pre  I diagnosed that this codeCalendar/code was imported through my first synchronisation from a new iPhone containing just its default calendar named codeCalendar/code.  Even with all my calendars more fresh on my Mac, this unexistent default codeCalendar/code was imported. hr I removed it on my Mac and made one more synchronisation to get rid of it on my iPhone and my Mac.  <comment120178> Let's pop in an OS and a version and I'll walk you through how to pick apart the data sources. Most likely "Calendar" is an exchange account with no actual calendars defined, but the steps vary widely between the various OS we support. (iOS 5 through soon 7 and the Mac equivalents) <comment121220> → stuffe: what point in this simple question may be clarified? <comment121221> I've reopened it, but with all the distinct questions, it looks like he may have been concerned with all sorts of guesses. Especially the part where you ask if you can proceed without creating any problem. Since that is so individual, who can really say if we feel you understand our potential answer (or if we really understand your question). I'd hate to be 80% certain what's happening but be wrong and have you take my advice only to lose a calendar without a backup. <comment121266> → bmike: thank you. Understood. I wouldn't answer such a risky question myself ☺. I'll take the risk with my own backup and test accounts, and answer with a validation through reality.
