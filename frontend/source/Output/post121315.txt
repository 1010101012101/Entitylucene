Reinstall Mac OSX on Ubuntu Macbook <body> Last year I installed Ubuntu on my 2006 MacBook (Intel), and erased the hard drive with MacOSX 10.5 in the process. Linux was fun, but now I want another Mac to play around with.  I've put 10.8's install files on a flash drive and rebooted (holding codeoption/code), but this brings up the Linux drive selector, and I do not see my flash drive as an option.  How can I go about installing 10.9 on my MacBook?  hr  Update: I've now got 10.8 on my flash drive. When I load Startup Manager, I see 3 options:  ol licodeWindows/code, which actually takes me to Ubuntu./li licodeEFI Boot/code which produces a "no" symbol and then the computer shuts down./li licoderEFIt/code/li /ol  I've got rEFIt running through my optical drive. When I select this, I get three primary choices:  ol licodeBoot Mac OSX from Mac OSX Install ESD/code: "no" symbol/li licodeBoot boot.efi from Mac OS X Install ESD/code: "no" symbol/li licodeBoot Linux from HD/code: Linux boots as normal./li /ol  <answer121316> You can't install Mavericks on a 2006 MacBook.     To install Mavericks, you need one of these Macs:      ul   liiMac (Mid-2007 or later)/li   liMacBook (13-inch Aluminum, Late 2008), (13-inch, Early 2009 or later)/li   liMacBook Pro (13-inch, Mid-2009 or later),/li   liMacBook Pro (15-inch or 17-inch, Mid/Late 2007 or later)/li   liMacBook Air (Late 2008 or later)/li   liMac mini (Early 2009 or later)/li   liMac Pro (Early 2008 or later)/li   liXserve (Early 2009)/li   /ul   supSource: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht5842/sup  <comment141404> Fine. I have 10.8 available also. Is this why the disk is unrecognized? <comment141405> @gmacfarlane What method did you use to put the 'install files' on your flash drive? It should have seen the drive, but not been able to boot from it. <comment141406> I used Disk Utility to execute the instructions here: http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/apple-in-the-enterprise/how-to-create-a-bootable-usb-to-install-os-x-mavericks/ <comment141407> I used this same flash drive to do a clean install on a 2012 MacBook Pro two weeks ago. <comment141408> @gmacfarlane Indeed, it should have seen the drive with the ‚å•-boot. C-boot won't boot from a USB. Holding a key on boot intercepts the boot at firmware level and shouldn't have any impact on the OS that is installed. It'll even work if you don't have an OS installed. <comment141427> See updates to question.
