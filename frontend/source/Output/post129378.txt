Internet Recovery loads ML instead of Mavericks <body> Had to recover my computer using Internet Recovery. For some reason it installed Mountain Lion instead of the Mavericks OS I previously had. How did this happen?  <answer129389> strongInternet Recovery will install the OS that came with the Mac/strong, regardless of whether you updated it at a later date. Once a Mountain Lion is installed, update it it Mavericks through the Mac App Store.
