Password is in a different language <body> I just opened my new MacBook Air and I noticed that when my computer asks for my password, the tinted word that should say "Password" (before I type it) is in a different language. How do I change it to English?  <answer134954> I've had this happen with a couple of new Macs at our office recently.
