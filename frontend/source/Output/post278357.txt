Restoring from Time Capsule says the drive does not have enough space <body> After my kid spilled a LARGE mug of coffee on the Air, we had to get the power supply and SSD replaced. Now I'm trying to restore the machine from the Time Capsule backup from a couple of weeks ago. I know two ways to do this:  1) Boot normally and run Migration Assistant. When I do this it shows backup sets for three machines, the one I'm restoring and two others in the house. The other two both come back with expected backup dates. The one I'm actually installing says codeLoading backup.../code forever.  2) Reboot with Command-R held down. When I use this method, I can select the TC, log in, and see three sets of backups. I can select the one for this machine and then see many backup sets inside, as expected. However, when I select these and attempt to restore them to the drive, it always says codeThe disk does not have enough space to restore your system./code That is odd considering it is the same size disk.  Does anyone have any advice?
