Can I make tmux scroll from my trackpad? <body> I want to set up iTerm2 to pass scroll events to tmux, so I can trivially enter (and exit) scrollback mode for whatever pane is active. Is this possible to do with iTerm2, or automation of some sort, or ...?  <answer175849> The mode is referred to as "copy mode" and as long as you're running codetmux/code 1.5 or higher you can add:  precodesetw -g mode-mouse on /code/pre  to your code~/.tmux.conf/code file and tmux will automatically enter and exit copy mode when you use the scroll wheel on your mouse.  As a bonus, this option allows you to select the tmux pane with your mouse:  precodeset -g mouse-select-pane on /code/pre  <comment294930> For`tmux` version 2.1 or higher follow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30185210/ubuntu-change-tmux-1-8-to-tmux-next-1-9
