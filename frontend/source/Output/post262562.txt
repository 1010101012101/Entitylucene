Photos have copied wrong? <body> I moved a folder of pictures from a computer to a USB SanDisk. Most photos show the same date the have on the computer except for image 208, which shows a completely different time. However, it still opens.  Also, there are some differences in the photos in terms of color and resolution in the USB and in the computer. Why is this happening?  <comment328938> Have you done anything to validate if there has been an actual change in the files? You could use `cmp` in Terminal or preform an SHA1 checksum on the files and see if they differ. You're going to have to validate the files in some manner to see if they differ binary. That said you've really not provide any information to effectively diagnose an issue, if there even is an issue. Without checksumming the files and comparing the original to the copies there really is nothing to do until that's done.
