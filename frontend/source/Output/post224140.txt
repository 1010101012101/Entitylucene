Finder Window when Uploading or Opening Files Missing Items <body> For some reason, my file window when I am opening a file/folder or uploading something the sidebar is missing a lot of items which makes navigating to my destination a pain. What am I missing? My normal finder window is fine and isn't missing any items. I tried to go into the librarypreferencesand deleting any com.apple.finder.plist like in another thread but I didn't find any files like that in my library. I searched my entire mac for them and didn't find any.  I'm using El Capitan.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mYg3f.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer224144> When finder is the current app, hit kbd command /kbd and kbd , /kbd at the same time. Click the codeSidebar/code tab. You can then select the things you want to show up in window. If they are already selected, try un-selecting them and re-selecting them.  Edit: As @NetherLinks mentioned, a few good answers are over at &quot;File Open&quot; dialog is missing sidebar items. Try them if mine doesn't work.  <comment271796> When looking for your Library folder, please make sure to look in the Library folder for your User (/Users/USER/Library), not the root Library folder (/Library). The first answer in that question indicates how to do that. <comment271817> I swear I'm following the steps and am still not finding any com.apple.finder.plist. <comment271818> when in your /Users/USER/Library/Preferences folder, have you tried: sorting by name? typing the name of the file directly into the Finder window? or using the Search field? As an additional thing, have you tried a simple (without deleting anything) restart of your Mac? <comment271918> I figured out why I was having issues- for whatever reason my USER window wasn't showing the library folder to me. So I had to "show view options" to see it. No wonder I was having confusions on your answer. Thank you for the help!
