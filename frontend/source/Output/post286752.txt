Reconfiguring a launchd job <body> I want to configure a codelaunchd/code daemon to run a virus scan daily.  I have written a code.plist/code and manually loaded it using codelaunchctl load/code but it doesn't seem to run.  I wanted to modify it to try and debug why.  However, it doesn't seem to be modifiable.  Here's the output of codesudo launchctl list org.macports.clamscan/code:  precode{         "LimitLoadToSessionType" = "System";         "Label" = "org.macports.clamscan";         "TimeOut" = 30;         "OnDemand" = true;         "LastExitStatus" = 19968;         "Program" = "clamscan";         "ProgramArguments" = (                 "clamscan";                 "--suppress-ok-results";                 "-l";                 "/var/log/clamscan.log";                 "-r";                 "/Users";         ); }; /code/pre  I tried to unload it to edit it and reload it but it didn't seem to work:  precode$ sudo launchctl unload org.macports.clamscan Password: $ sudo launchctl list org.macports.clamscan {         "LimitLoadToSessionType" = "System";         "Label" = "org.macports.clamscan";         "TimeOut" = 30;         "OnDemand" = true;         "LastExitStatus" = 19968;         "Program" = "clamscan";         "ProgramArguments" = (                 "clamscan";                 "--suppress-ok-results";                 "-l";                 "/var/log/clamscan.log";                 "-r";                 "/Users";         ); }; /code/pre  I tried to modify it to replace codeclamscan/code with a script so I can verify which arguments it was being called with.  However, when I try and load it, it complains that it's already loaded.  precode$ sudo launchctl load ~/Code/org.macports.clamscan.plist  /Users/Stephen/Code/org.macports.clamscan.plist: service already loaded /code/pre  Aside from rebooting is there a way to edit an installed codelaunchd/code job?  This is for Sierra.  <answer290749> You can tell launchd to remove it from its cache and reread from disk. From the man page:  precode uncache service-name           This subcommand instructs launchd to bypass its service cache           for the named service and instead read the service's configu-           ration file directly from disk.  launchd maintains an in-mem-           ory cache of XPC service configuration files to minimize the           disk I/O. This subcommand will remove a cached entry so that           developers may more rapidly iterate on a service's configura-           tion. It should not ever be used as part of production work-           flow. /code/pre
