Disable command-enter keyboard shortcut in iTerm2 <body> Currently cmd-enter in iTerm2 toggles fullscreen mode. Is there a way to disable this keyboard shortcut?  <answer180802> In iTerm, go to Preferences  Keys, and click the + button at the bottom of the list. There, you can add a new keyboard shortcut for kbd⌘/kbd+kbd↩︎/kbd, which will by default be ignored.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HxXvE.png" alt="screenshot of panel"
