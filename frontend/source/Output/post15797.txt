Map Right Command Key to Escape? <body> Quite simply, I'd just like to modify the right command key to escape and that's it. Keep the left command key as is.  The only tool I've been able to find for this is ControllerMate but I'd rather not pay $14 to map one key.  Can anyone suggest a free alternative?  <answer15810> You can download Ukelele. It is an free keyboard layout editor, and you can make a new layout for your keyboard where simple redefine the keys. In the package are sample keyboards and a manual/tutorial too.  <answer95592> Ukelele or keylayout files can't be used to change modifier keys to other keys. But you could use a private.xml like this with KeyRemap4MacBook:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;   &lt;item&gt;     &lt;name&gt;test&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;identifier&gt;test&lt;/identifier&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::COMMAND_R, KeyCode::ESCAPE&lt;/autogen&gt;   &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  This would only change pressing the right command to escape:  precode__KeyOverlaidModifier__ KeyCode::COMMAND_R, KeyCode::COMMAND_R, KeyCode::ESCAPE /code/pre  code&lt;only&gt;VI, TERMINAL&lt;/only&gt;/code would apply the settings only when MacVim, Terminal, or iTerm is frontmost.  See the source for the key code values and predefined settings.  <comment17218> I have no idea how to use this application. Each time I press the right command key, the left one lights up on it's keyboard mapper. And also, browsing the comments the author mentions that you can't differentiate between the different command keys (in ukelele). <comment17220> So, my answer was not helpful. I know no other way, sry. <comment112151> I thought the left and right command keys are the same key codes and therefore indistinguishable.
