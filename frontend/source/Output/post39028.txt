How do I sync contents of my iPhone App with iPad using iCloud? <body> I have iPad and iPod, both on iOS 5 with iCloud enabled.  I have an app which I have installed on both these devices. With this app, I create some files, which I can see in Documents folder of iTunes.  How do I sync these files of that app in both devices using iCloud?  Please let me know.  Thanks!  <answer39037> Your emapp/em (no details provided) needs to support iCloud in order to sync files between devices.  <comment44185> Of course, that app does support iCloud. <comment44186> @meetpd If the app supports iCloud and it still does not sync files between devices, contact the developers of the app for support. BTW, what app is it? <comment44207> Does Settings have any iCloud-specific settings?  Maybe you need to enable this feature for your app.
