Apple TV connection <body> I want to connect to wifi an Apple TV without its original remote. I've read other threads on here, I have restored my Apple TV to factory settings and when I come to the bluetooth connection step:  my only bluetooth keyboards are my HP Envy notebook or a Surface tablet, Windows 10 (I guess!) has the keyboard on the screen feature, so I thought by connecting the device to the Apple TV, maybe I can use that keyboard to connect to my wifi.  when I try to pair my laptop/surface to Apple TV, I get a message box with: Compare Passcodes, and the laptop/Surface offers me a 6 digit code (always a different one) asking me if it matches the Apple TV code  but the Apple TV shows NO CODE on the tv screen, just its select language page and the message to turn on a bluetooth keyboard at this time  I click Yes the passcodes match, selecting No or Cancel does the same thing, cancel the attempt to pair  it tries to connect and I receive the message that the passcode is wrong  the tv screen tells me to turn off my laptop and then back on and try to pair it again, this message is from Apple TV  what am I missing? how can I establish this bluetooth connection to the Apple TV in order to control it via my keyboard and finally connect it to my wifi?
