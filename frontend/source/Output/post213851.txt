Using the space bar as a shortcut in finder to preview audio files <body> I recently was given an old MacBook (Late 2007) running 10.4 from a family member. I'm using it basically as a backup for my studio computer. It's going to contain only the apps included in 10.7 and 1 additional NI audio product. My question is, my other mac and all I've ever worked on (and it's a few) have been able to use the space bar to preview a highlighted audio file in Finder. Is there a way to cut this off/on? I really like this feature and it saves me probably 30-60 minutes a day because I go through thousands of audio files a day.  <answer213883> Looks like Quick View is only available for Mac OS X 10.5 and later.  Bottom line, download 10.5 and the spacebar Quick Look will work.  As a side note, if you're looking for other shortcuts that might be missing from OS 10.4, there's a shortcut creator (on steroids) that's free, and it's called BetterTouchTool. Go here to download it (http://www.bettertouchtool.net). Just remember you have to have 10.8 or later for it work.  You won't regret it.  <comment258117> Are you using 10.4 or 10.7? The question is somewhat unclear here. <comment258120> sorry I see what you mean, it's running 10.4 now waiting on tiger to arrive at the moment. <comment258124> Lion, I guess you mean...
