How to Reset Full-Screen Terminal.app Preferences to Factory Defaults <body> On an iMac running Mac OS X version 10.7.5 I have accidentally resized Terminal.app to full-screen (272 x 76) and am unable to resize Terminal.app to a smaller size.  How do I resize Terminal.app to the factory default size or a size where I can use the mouse to resize Terminal.app?  <answer89081> You have (at least) wo possibilities:  1) You could click on the zoom button to revert the zoom effect (the green circle in the upper left corner in the image below: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/toAUT.png" alt="enter image description here"  2) You can enter smaller values for the window size under "Preferences": img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NBAXf.png" alt="enter image description here"
