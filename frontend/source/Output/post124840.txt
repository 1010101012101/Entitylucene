Is there a way to add searchable tags to individual pages in a PDF? <body> Similar to the way Youtube videos are tagged, I would like to be add tags to individual pages in a PDF based on what they're about. Ideally it would work so that if I tag a page "apple orange banana strawberry lemon" and I search for "banana lemon" then that page will come up (ie the search terms don't need to be in the correct order for the result to be displayed).   Is there any way I can do this or am I stuck with what I've got?
