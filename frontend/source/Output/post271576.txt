Open an Apple Mail attachment after saving it <body> The Chrome and Safari web browsers allow you to easily open a file after downloading it: Chrome has a horizontal bar at the bottom, and Safari has a dropdown menu from the toolbar.   I would like a similar capability in Apple Mail. I would like to save an email attachment to a specific place on my computer, then, click a button to open the file from its saved location. How can I do this?  I know that I could just open the Mail attachment and then save it in my desired location, but this is undesirable to me because I think that this means Mail will make a copy of the file and store it somewhere in some cache directory.
