Editing war file with Midnight Commander <body> I'm trying to edit the contents of a war file on midnight commander (Mac OSX). With a normal zip file, this works fine. However, when I try to open a war file, I get an error message:     gzip: stdin has more than one entry--rest ignored      Cannot open tar archive   strongfilepath/strong/ugz://   This is probably some kind of configuration issue with mc. Any ideas how to resolve this?  <answer81740> Midnight commander tries to open war files as tgz files. Is should open them as zip files instead.  To fix this open "Edit extension file" in "Command" menue (F9, C, e). Search for ".war" and delete it from the listings. The modified listing should look like:  precode# .tgz, .tpz, .tar.gz, .tar.z, .tar.Z, .ipk, .gem regex/\.t([gp]?z|ar\.g?[zZ])$|\.ipk$|\.gem$ &lt;------&gt;Open=%cd %p/utar:// &lt;------&gt;View=%view{ascii} /usr/local/Cellar/midnight-commander/4.8.7/libexec/mc/ext.d/archive.sh view tar.gz /code/pre  Then add the following snippet somewhere in the file:  precode# .war regex/\.war$ &lt;------&gt;Open=%cd %p/uzip:// &lt;------&gt;View=%view{ascii} /usr/local/Cellar/midnight-commander/4.8.7/libexec/mc/ext.d/archive.sh view zip /code/pre  <comment96443> I think issue introduced: https://www.midnight-commander.org/ticket/2891 request to fix: http://www.midnight-commander.org/ticket/2974
