How can I see which QuickLook plugin is responsible for which data type? <body> Sometimes, QuickLook doesn't work right with certain file types, even though it should. Or a file now looks different in QuickLook than it used to.  How to find out which QuickLook plugin, or .qlgenerator, is responsible for which types, and what to do about it?  <answer153596> Open Terminal, and type the following:  precodeqlmanage -m plugins /code/pre  This will give you a fairly long list of all your active QuickLook plugins:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z3AME.png" alt=""  The types listed there might look a little strange, like codecom.apple.safari.bookmark/code. Those are Apple codeUniform Type Identifiers/code or short codeUTType/code identifiers, and there is a list of the default ones available from Apple here. If you're looking for a specific file extension, it might be a good idea to open that link and search the page for it. A search for codetxt/code reveals its UTType to be codepublic.plain-text/code, and this is the type you will find it under in the qlmanage output.  So if a particular type of file looks strange in QuickLook, just look up its path here, go there and disable it (for instance by renaming its file extension to something other than codeqlgenerator/code), then come back to Terminal and type  precodeqlmanage -r /code/pre  to force QuickLook to reload its list of plugins. Run codeqlmanage -m plugins/code again to make sure the offending qlgenerator is not loaded anymore. QuickLook will even load them if they're in the trash!  Open a Finder window, find a file of the right type, and hit the space bar to double-check.
