Safari does not restore tabs / not Resuming <body> It seems my Safari is not resuming correctly.   I open some tabs, then quit and when fire up Safari again it's opened like wasn't have any tabs opened before.  Is it some version bug, or i should look for something in Safari prefs?  ul liSafari 5.1.7 (7534.57.2)/li liMOX 10.7.4 (Build 11E53)/li /ul  EDIT: In reaction to Michiel i've checked whether i have Resume turned on. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Au429.png" alt="System preferences -&gt; General"  <answer54133> It's not a setting in Safari, but a general setting. Go to your strongSystem Preferences &lt; General/strong and make sure strongRestore windows when quitting and re-opening apps/strong is checked on.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iRbZT.png" alt="enter image description here"  But you can install some 3th party apps too.    ul liThere is SafariRestore, which will basically do the same. But you stronghave/strong to disable the strongRestore windows when quitting and re-opening apps/strong on the screenshot above!/li liYou can also add the Sessions extension to Safari which will do the same./li /ul  I haven't any experience with neither of these apps, so please let me know if it works out!  <answer54134> Now it's working again.  Steps i did:  ul liDisable and Enable again resume in System preferences &rarr; General/li liEnable and Disable again extensions in Safari &rarr; Preferences. I don't have any extensions installed. The "abling" was just about the Safari's functionality img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ekqPB.png" alt="Abling Extensions in Safari"/li /ul  I don't know what of these steps fixed it, but now it simply works :/  P.S.: Back to  Lauri Ranta's check. It has still same result  precodedefaults read com.apple.Safari NSQuitAlwaysKeepsWindows                                                                                                                      2012-06-19 11:13:35.069 defaults[2240:707]  The domain/default pair of (/Users/mailo/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Safari.plist, NSQuitAlwaysKeepsWindows) does not exist /code/pre  <answer79902> I found another workaround, although I'm not sure why this worked or even if it actually worked or was simply a coincidence.  What I did was: Restore Safari (in the main Safari menu). I had every box checked except the ones about location and saving passwords. So it was sort of an "erase". Then I quit Safari en started it again. Now it works again, correctly resuming all tabs I had open.  <comment61945> Is restoring windows when quitting and re-opening apps unchecked in the general preferences? Does `defaults read com.apple.Safari NSQuitAlwaysKeepsWindows` return 0? <comment61946> Unfortunately i have it enabled (see updated question) <comment61947> http://git.io/csCr6w -- is there some clean way to fix it? I don't want to do it via shell <comment61948> Hmm, that's odd. It works for me with great ease. I'll check for more solutions... <comment61949> Last week or so it was working for me also <comment61950> What did you do in the mean time? (Install or delete something?) <comment61951> I just thought NSQuitAlwaysKeepsWindows might have been set to false. But since there was no key for it, it's something else... <comment61952> See my edited answer! <comment61953> I found a questionable fix. Now it works, but thank you. The only thing which could cause this, could be the recent Safari update. I wasn't doing any system invasive stuff for a long time, maybe for all the time i have it installed ;) <comment61954> Ok, great if you solved your own question! Good luck with it!
