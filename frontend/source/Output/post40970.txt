simple timestamp for SMS on iPhone <body> I am thinking this is an easy question, because I know how to do it in iChat for the computer.  But for an iPhone, SMS messages are shown as a speech bubble in a conversation with someone. Aside from the timestamp banner that appears before a message that is a long time after previous messages in an SMS conversation, how can I get a timestamp (or the time sent) of an SMS message?  <answer41050> if your iPhone is jailbroken you can download this tweak (xMessages ) for free from the cydia store  <comment46389> Are you open to solutions that sync to a computer or does it need to be constrained to software that runs on iOS? <comment46654> but my iPhone is not jailbroken... can I get the timestamp info a different way? <comment47435> Well. You can't. But it's free and legal to jailbreak your phone <comment64043> But jailbreaking the iPhone automatically forfeits any support and VOIDS AppleCare which in my opinion isn't worth jailbreaking. Are there any other possible ways to have SMS timestamps w/o jailbreaking? <comment64132> a) you can always restore and get back apple warranty. And there's isn't no other way.
