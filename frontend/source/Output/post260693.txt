Applescript programmatically import bookmarks into Chrome <body> strongI am using AppleScript to programmatically import bookmarks into Google Chrome./strongbr The method I am using (rather unreliably) is 'System Events' to imitate certain keyboard actions until the function is complete. I know that JavaScript can be used to achieve the same outcomes, but have not used it before.  precodeset homepage to "www.example.com" set bookmarksFile to "/path/to/bookmarks/file"  tell application "Google Chrome"     activate     delay 0.5     open location "chrome://settings/startup"     delay 1     tell application "System Events"         keystroke tab         delay 0.5         keystroke homepage         delay 0.5         keystroke return         repeat 2 times             delay 0.5             keystroke return         end repeat          -- IMPORT BOOKMARK FILE         tell application "Google Chrome"             open location "chrome://settings/importData"             activate         end tell         delay 0.5         keystroke space         delay 0.5         keystroke "b"         delay 0.25         keystroke return         delay 0.5         repeat 3 times             keystroke tab         end repeat         delay 0.5         keystroke return         delay 1         keystroke "g" using {shift down, command down}         delay 0.5         keystroke bookmarksFile         repeat 2 times             delay 0.5             keystroke return         end repeat         delay 3     end tell end tell /code/pre  strongProblem 1:/strongbr If the user clicks away while this is running, errors will occur and the whole thing messes up.  strongProblem 2:/strongbr Using delays often adds to the unreliability to the script - sometimes things take longer than other times.br strongProblem 3:/strongbr Along the way I am battling several popups (run the code to see what I mean). Surely some JavaScript could go the same but I have googled for many hours now without luck.  strongIs there a way to do the same in JavaScript or similar (setting startup page and import bookmarks), or at least a way to make the whole thing more reliable?/strong  Any help is greatly appreciated.
