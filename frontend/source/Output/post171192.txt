Mac trying to play audio through monitor's thunderbolt port <body> I have a Dell monitor connected through a thunderbolt port.  Sometimes my Mac for some reason is attempting to play audio through that port.  How do I stop this from happening?  It appears in my list of sound outputs in system preferences but I have headphones selected.  Unplugging the monitor from the thunderbolt port makes the audio work correctly.  <answer171220> Same thing happened to me. You have to manually change it in System Preferences  Sound  Output Volume.  <answer171231> Alt-click the audio item in the menu bar and select the proper source.  <comment201393> It thinks you have a Video+Audio device (like TV) plugged in :) do you ? what does it say for what is plugged in? <comment201898> I found the issue.  I was using GarageBand and it has it's own setting for audio out separate from System Preferences. <comment201902> nice job, make it a answer !
