Reattaching remote servers: no such file or directory in terminal <body> I'm using the codeConnect to Server/code tool to mount a remote drive.  I'm able to access this via codeTerminal/code at code/Volumes/REMOTE/code.  If I unmount and remount the same connection however, my existing terminal windows can't reconnect --- I have to open new terminal windows.  Is there any way around this behavior?  e.g.  precode$ cd /Volumes/REMOTE $ ls Desktop    envs    intel     &lt;un-mount&gt; &lt;re-mount&gt; $ pwd /Volumes/REMOTE $ ls ls: .: No such file or directory /code/pre  If I have an emacs session open with a remote file, and the connection is lost and reconnected (un-mounted, and re-mounted), the session still works fine.  <answer220260> As of El Capitan, OSX 10.11.0, this is no longer an issue.  Terminal is now able to recover once the remote server has been remounted.
