Using Dark Menu Bar and Dock <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mALfp.png" alt="enter image description here"  In the ten minutes since I have updated my OS I have restarted the computer three times (I was testing something with displays having separate spaces, and a restart is easier than logging in). Each time it's started back up I've had to emuncheck/em that box.  After reading Cannot disable "Dark Menu Bar" on Mac OS I think there is a good chance my preference files have been corrupted (since installing El Capitan deleted all my system preference files). I don't know how to fix them.  I've never had a problem with the menu bar or it's color before. Can I stop this from happening a fourth or fifth time?  <answer252346> Restart your Mac. Do not change any settings  Execute codechmod -RN ~/Library//code in terminal.  It'll restore permissions for your library folder. After the command have finished running (it can take from seconds to several minutes) try to change the dark setting, and restart.  <comment313945> Did you try the solution proposed in the link you provided? <comment313946> I did not. That problem is different than mine and I thought the answers where specific to it. Plus, none of the suggestions worked for the asker... But it is worth a try. <comment314295> Okay. So that didn't work. This time my computer was sleep for about 13 hours and when I opened it the dark menu bar was back. I checked **System Preferences** (to do one of the suggestions from the post I linked) and decided to check **Accessibility**, which lead me to quitting **f.lux**. And as soon as the app closed my menu bar went back to normal.
