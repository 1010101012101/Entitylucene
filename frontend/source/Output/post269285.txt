macOS Sierra: mounting NFS volumes <body> I have a Linux server with a number of NFS exports. I have been mounting them on my Mac by setting up an codeauto_nfs/code file, and mounting them in code/nfs/…/code folders.  I emthink/em this may the cause of some peculiar behaviour with some applications, which don’t seem to be able to fully traverse these volumes (see Applications Not Working Properly with Networked volumes for details on what I mean by peculiar).  When I mount a SMB share, it appears as a separate volume under my computer, but not so with NFS.  I conclude that things would work better for me if I mount the NFS shares in the code/Volumes/code directory. But I can’t:  ul liThe settings in codeauto_nfs/code require existing directories, and in Sierra, I can’t create one./li liI cannot mount an NFS share using the codenfs:/code protocol, since apparently this isn’t supported./li /ul  Apparently Sierra changed a few rules regarding the code/Volumes/code directory.  How can I mount an NFS share as an ordinary volume? Mount NFS share in /Volumes as a drive, but:  ul liIt’s an old one and not applicable to Sierra/li liThe suggestions don’t work here/li /ul  <answer269817> In Finder, press cmd + k and enter the path to the NFS server/share:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gfrG7.png" alt="connect to server"  For me this mounted as /Volumes/users-1 (but I already had /Volumes/Users mounted).  precodeiMac21:~ user$ df -h /Volumes/users-1 Filesystem               Size   Used  Avail Capacity iused     ifree %iused  Mounted on 192.168.7.5:/nas/users  5.4Ti  4.8Ti  292Gi    95%  261121 366027775    0%   /Volumes/users-1 iMac21:~ user$ /code/pre  If you wanted this to happen on boot you can add it into the login items for your user.  <answer292670> The accepted answer only works when the NFS server allows connections on non-reserved ports (i.e. 1024).  For my CentOS 7.3 box this is not the case by default and I had to add stronginsecure/strong to the mount.   E.g.: code/my/export 192.168.5.0/24(insecure)/code  If that's not possible: using codemount/codeyou can supply an option to allow reserved ports from the Mac side: codesudo mount -t nfs -o resvport server:/my/export nfs/code  <comment339003> I had already tried the `nfs:` protocol, as noted in my question, but it didn’t work then. I think my error was in not including the rest of the path. I didn’t know you could add a volume to the login items, so that’s two things I learned. Thanks.
