Macbook | Mouse and Trackpad Options <body> Is there a way to set the options for scrolling in the following way :  strongUse this option when the trackpad is used for scrolling and navigation | Keep this option checked./strongbr "Move Content in the direction of finger moment when scrolling or navigating"   And when the strongmouse/strong is being used, I want the above option to be strongunchecked/strong.  <answer100652> I'm guessing that you are talking about the setting that, for me (British English) shows in Settings  Trackpad  Scroll &amp; Zoom  "Scroll direction: natural".  This discussion talks about this issue, and several people mention Scroll Reverser.  It has separate options for "Reverse Trackpad" and "Reverse Mouse".  (I haven't tested your scenario, but I have used this software for other reasons.)  <comment118482> Thanks for the reply. I did check out the app later on the same day and it works. <comment118501> Great! If the answer was useful, would you consider voting on it and accepting it?
