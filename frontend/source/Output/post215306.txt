Getting rid of a number on a device in iMessage <body> A few days ago I noticed that my son was receiving my iMessages. He went on to messages in settings and unchecked my number from "send &amp; receive" and "you can be reached at iMessage at".  Then it stopped. My question is why was my number even there? How to I strongpermanently/strong get rid of it from his iPhone? I signed out of iCloud on my phone and signed out of Apple ID on my phone. None of this removed the number from his phone. How do I fix this? If my phone has no affiliation with his in Apple ID why is my number still there?  I am running iOS 9.1 and he is running iOS 7.3. We both have an iPhone 5s.  <comment260060> Don't share appleId's. <comment260094> I rather think that one time daddy's simcard ended up in son's iphone.
