iPod to iphone transferring <body> I wanted to transfer an app from my iPod to my iPhone. The the app I paid for was on my iPod. And I'm trying not to pay for the app again. Is there a way I can transfer the app from my iPod to my iPhone without using any laptop or computer?  <answer247210> Simply browse for the app on your iPhone and download it from there under the account that you paid for the app originally.  Follow this apple documentation on how to download a previously paid app.  <comment305000> Did you try to redownload it from the App Store, using the same account as from your iPod?
