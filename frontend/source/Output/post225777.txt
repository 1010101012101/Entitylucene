Is it possible to access the functions for the PDF overlay bezel in Safari via keyboard? <body> When hovering the mouse pointer at the bottom of a PDF file being displayed within the Safari browser window, you get a set of 4 icons for Zoom Out, Zoom In, Open in… and Save To Downloads:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/huaJD.png" alt="Safari PDF hover menu"  I would like to be able to access the "Open in…" function via a keyboard shortcut, but can't seem to find the related item in any Safari menu. Is this possible to do?
