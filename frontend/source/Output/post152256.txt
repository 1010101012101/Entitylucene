problems with safari search results (freeze, crash) after updating to ios 8 (ipad air) <body> ever since i updated to ios 8 on my ipad air 1, and even after downloading the first software update 8.1, safari has been really annoying! First, it often freezes and shuts down when i search with words in the url box at the top.  Second, it freezes after showing the google search results, and it doesn't take me to any of the search result pages even if i tap on the link a few times, and id have to reload the search a few times until it responds. :///////// Has anyone had similar issues? Is this because i have too many windows open... Or something else... Thank you  <answer153541> I am having exactly the same issues with iOS 8.1. The Safari frrezes are no better with the update. I am using Google chrome instead now.  <answer153551> I'm experiencing this exact same problem. No hyperlinks work on Google search results but swiping to scroll seems to "unlock it"  <comment179677> Mine is doing something very similar: When I google search from the url bar it returns a bunch of results but I can't click on any of them (or on the "News", "Videos", etc options either). HOWEVER, if I quickly scroll the results up or down just the tiniest bit, then I can click on them. Pretty dumb. I am also using an ipad air with ios 8. <comment179720> Omg you are right! That's amazing, thank you! Lol. Hopefully they fix this in the next update... <comment180872> Thanks for the comment, hopefully it gets fixed soon :/ <comment180874> Yea very annoying! I didn't have this issue when i had ios 7 :/ <comment181704> Not a solution, but just click the refresh circular arrow to the right of the url, and it un freezes.
