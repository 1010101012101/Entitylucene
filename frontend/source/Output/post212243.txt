USB to serial Adapter not working after upgrade to El Capitan <body> I have been using a TRENDnet TU-S9 USB to serial adapter for a couple years.    When I upgraded OSX from 10.10 Yosemite to 10.11 El Capitan, it stopped working.  I've tried reinstalling the driver, but that did not fix it.  I ran codeioreg -p IOUSB/code and could still see the device, which is a good sign.  precode...     +-o USB-Serial Controller D@14200000  &lt;class AppleUSBDevice, id 0x100000533, registered, matched, active, busy 0 (6 ms), retain 11&gt; ... /code/pre  Unfortunately code/dev/code does not contain codetty.usbserial/code when my adapter is connected.  How do I get OSX to create code/dev/tty.usbserial/code when I connect my adapter?  <answer213750> Prolific has a new driver out that works with El Cap: http://www.prolific.com.tw/US/ShowProduct.aspx?p_id=229&amp;pcid=41  <comment256269> Best guess would be look/wait for an updated driver - always an issue with a major OS update... don't jump until you are certain all your esoterica has functional drivers. I can't use El Cap until my pro audio rig has updated drivers... or unless I don't want to earn a living in the meantime... <comment258245> Jan Lehnardt provided a working driver. Thank you, I have tested and confirmed running Mac OS 10.11.1 with zterm and alcatel switches. <comment258645> Thank you, this is exactly what I needed.
