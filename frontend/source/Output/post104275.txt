Unable to delete songs from iTunes Match - they always come back <body> I'm so lost here. I imported an audio book from CD into my iTunes library. The genre was wrong on one of the 5 CDs ("Spoken &amp; Audio") instead of "Audio Book". So I changed it. iTunes Match did its job, uploaded the titles and messed everything up. I ended up with all the titles being duplicated, one per genre. In the end I just wanted to get rid of the files. I deleted the titles from iTunes 11 and checked in Findes that they are gone for good. I was also ask if I wanted to delete the titles in iCloud too. I agreed. Then iTunes Match updated itself and everything was back. I retried - same issue. The titles come back with an iCloud icon.  How the heck can I get rid of the titles and restart?  <answer104282> Its a pain, but you want to toggle iTunes Match and delete them again.  In iTunes:  ol liClick the Store menu and select "Turn Off iTunes Match"/li liClick the Store menu and select "Turn On iTunes Match"/li liDelete Songs/li /ol  <comment122774> Doesn't work. They are gone, then I select "Update iTM" and they're all back. I have now updated to iTunes 11.1.1 (11) and will retry. <comment122781> Your advice plus the update to 11.1.1 (11) of iTunes fixed it.
