macOS Sierra /usr/libexec/lsd crashes during boot, system won't start <body> After a installing a system update my Mac mini won't boot at all, or maybe will but only after a few hours of being stuck at boot screen.   I found the following in /var/log/system.log (repeats a lot of timeS):  precodeNov  8 08:30:03 mac com.apple.xpc.launchd[1] (com.apple.lsd[65134]): Service exited due to signal: Segmentation fault: 11 sent by exc handler[0] Nov  8 08:30:03 mac logd[79]: metadata shared cached uuid is null (using logd's shared cache info) lsd (65135) Nov  8 08:30:03 mac logd[79]: Failed to harvest strings for pathless uuid '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000' Nov  8 08:30:03 mac ReportCrash[65063]: Saved crash report for lsd[65134] version 775.8.2 to /Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/lsd_2016-11-08-083003_mac.crash Nov  8 08:30:04 mac logd[79]: metadata shared cached uuid is null (using logd's shared cache info) logKextDaemon (65136) Nov  8 08:30:04 mac logd[79]: Failed to harvest strings for pathless uuid '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000' Nov  8 08:30:04 mac com.apple.xpc.launchd[1] (com.apple.lsd[65135]): Service exited due to signal: Segmentation fault: 11 sent by exc handler[0] Nov  8 08:30:05 mac logd[79]: metadata shared cached uuid is null (using logd's shared cache info) lsd (65137) Nov  8 08:30:05 mac logd[79]: Failed to harvest strings for pathless uuid '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000' Nov  8 08:30:05 mac com.apple.xpc.launchd[1] (com.fsb.logKext[65136]): Service exited with abnormal code: 1 Nov  8 08:30:05 mac com.apple.xpc.launchd[1] (com.fsb.logKext): Service only ran for 0 seconds.

I think I'll delete this question as I've already erased the entire disk and now reinstalling the system. Thanks for you help anyway!
