Why does iCloud music library show songs that I haven't added and how to remove them? <body> I've started using Apple Music and I've turned on iCloud music library which I think is a cool feature. However, The moment I've turned it on, my iPhone's library started to look like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nMhOl.png" alt="enter image description here"  There are strongmany/strong grayed out songs that I haven't even added to my library or ever listened in my life? Where are these songs coming from and how do I remove them from my library (of course there are 1000s of them so I can't delete them one by one)? There are also duplicates of my own songs, and Music.app is constantly hanging and crashing. If I turn off iCloud music library, everything goes back to normal, but I want to use that feature. More interestingly, even though I've also enabled iCloud music library on my iTunes on Mac, it doesn't show any extra/irrelevant/grayed out tracks.  How can I use iCloud music library on iOS (I'm on latest stable, 9.2.1) without it adding 1000s of that songs I'm not interested in?
