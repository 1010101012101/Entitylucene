Terminal: map super/command key in stty <body> I want to remap terminal shortcuts (In particular, I want to remap codeINTR/code from codeCTRL+C/code to codeCommand+C/code) in Terminal.  So these are my current stty bindings  precode$ stty -a speed 38400 baud; 38 rows; 179 columns; lflags: icanon isig iexten echo echoe echok echoke -echonl echoctl     -echoprt -altwerase -noflsh -tostop -flusho pendin -nokerninfo     -extproc iflags: -istrip icrnl -inlcr -igncr ixon -ixoff ixany imaxbel iutf8     -ignbrk brkint -inpck -ignpar -parmrk oflags: opost onlcr -oxtabs -onocr -onlret cflags: cread cs8 -parenb -parodd hupcl -clocal -cstopb -crtscts -dsrflow     -dtrflow -mdmbuf cchars: discard = ^O; dsusp = ^Y; eof = ^D; eol = &lt;undef&gt;;     eol2 = &lt;undef&gt;; erase = ^?; intr = ^C; kill = ^U; lnext = ^V;     min = 1; quit = ^\; reprint = ^R; start = ^Q; status = ^T;     stop = ^S; susp = ^Z; time = 0; werase = ^W; /code/pre  And for example if you want to remap something it'd be like  precodestty intr \^c /code/pre  Which maps codeSIGINT/code to codeCTRL+C/code  But I want to map codeSIGINT/code to codeCOMMAND+C/code. Something like this (which is invalid):  precodestty intr âŒ˜c /code/pre  Now I know that the terminal doesn't really recognize the Command key, but is there a creative way of doing it?  Note: I know it can be done with ITerm2 but am wondering if there's a way to do it with the vanilla Terminal.  Thanks
