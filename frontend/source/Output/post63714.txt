Is / always the path of the system drive? <body> I need to know which drive is the System drive.   Is it safe to assume that code//code is always the system drive ? Or in some situation (for example booting from a FW drive) code//code is not the drive were the system is. thanks.   <answer63719> The basic answer is yes, although it depends a bit on exactly what you mean by "system drive". A few versions ago, Apple introduced what they call "Bootâ‰ Root"; I can't find much documentation on it, but the basic idea is that OS X can load the booter file from one volume, then use a different volume as the operating system root.  For instance, when your startup volume is encrypted with FileVault 2, it actually loads the booter from a different volume (the hidden "Recovery HD" volume); the booter decrypts the startup volume, and then loads the operating system from the encrypted volume.  The rule is that / will always refer to the volume you are emrunning the operating system from/em, just not necessarily the one that the boot process started from. This applies whether you're starting from an internal disk, FireWire disk, USB disk, NetBoot disk image, disk image,... whatever.  <comment73709> Off topic, go to stackoverflow. <comment73710> Yeah ... the same post was closed/deleted there. And since it's a OS X global question ... It might have more its place here. <comment73711> Did they give a reason? Anyways, `/` is by definition the path of the drive from which you booted. <comment73712> No the post was just deleted right after I got closed ... But thx for your answer.
