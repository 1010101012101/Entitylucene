How do I set up a server at home for our MacBook Airs <body> My wife and I both have MacBook Airs, which means we are both constantly trying to find stuff to delete to stay under our 256GB.  In our current setup, we both back up to a TimeMachine and we both have CrashPlan Pro.  We have some recent photos on my wife's machine, but most of our pictures and videos are on an external hard drive that I back up to CrashPlan a couple times a year.    What I would like to do is have a server of sorts that both my wife and I can connect to over wifi.  We would keep all photos, videos, and old files on the "server", which would be backed up to CrashPlan, and current files on our local machines that are backed up to Time Capsule and CrashPlan.  How would I go about setting this up and what would be the right machine to use for the server function.  Thanks in advance.  -FL  <comment368119> Not really an apple question. Hence irrelevant to this stackexchange. Better to ask in superuser.com or askubuntu.com
