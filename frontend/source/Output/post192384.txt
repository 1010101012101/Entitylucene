AirDropped a folder onto my iPad mini - can't find it <body> I used AirDrop to transfer a folder of videos from my MacBook Pro to my iPad mini (first gen). I realise now that I should've just sent the videos individually, but the problem is that I now can't delete, as it takes up a lot of space on my iPad.  <comment228801> Did you go to Settings  General  Usage  Manage Storage and look for Videos? It should allow you to delete them from there, if they are being stored as videos and not as attachments within Messages. <comment228802> Also, you can open the Videos app and they should appear there. <comment228823> Are you sure you airdroped it? did you get a message asking you to accept ?
