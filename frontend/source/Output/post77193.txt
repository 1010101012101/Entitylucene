Is there a way to force iTunes 11 to update tags? <body> Is there any way to force iTunes 11 to rescan the music library and update the information for any tags that have been changed outside of iTunes? I know that selecting a single track and then 'Get Info" will force an update for that track, but it doesn't seem to work with multiple tracks.  <answer77207> You can go to iTunes-Preferences-Advanced, uncheck codeKeep iTunes Media folder organized/code, OK, then go back and check the option again. It will rescan all track after you click OK.  <answer103445> From the MusicBrainz iTunes Guide:     h2Updating Library in iTunes/h2      h3Brute force method (full library re-scan)/h3      This method works best ifbr     - you've re-tagged a whole lot of your files and don't remember which files/albumsbr     - or there are far too many for the first approachbr     - or you've moved/renamed files and iTunes has lost them       Ready?      ul   liGo to File  Add Folder to Library/li   liPoint it at the top of your iTunes directory ("My Music\iTunes\iTunes Music\Music" on Windows, by default)./li   liiTunes will rescan your music, but recognize it's already imported, so you shouldn't end up with duplicate files (unless you have moved/renamed files) /li   /ul   You can also refresh a selection of songs by following the AppleScript based solution (on the same page linked above):     h3Mac-only advanced method/h3      This method is a bit more complicated to set up, but easy to use.      Fire up Script Editor (which is under Applications/AppleScript, but it will work with TextEdit). Paste the following code, then save as a Script called /Library/iTunes/Scripts/Refresh.scpt (create the Scripts directory if it doesn't already exist).           tell application "iTunes"br      refresh selectionbr     end tell         Now, inside iTunes, you should see a Scripts menu (an icon of a scroll, just left of Help). The "Refresh" item on that menu will force it to re-read the tags for all tracks that you have selected.    <comment107429> I just tried this with iTunes 11.0.2 and it did not update the tags. <comment177248> The AppleScript trick is super neat! Thanks a lot. <comment177727> Note that you can save that script in your users home (~/Library/iTunes/Scripts) and it works also in newest iTunes 12
