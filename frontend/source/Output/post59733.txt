Mountain Lion: can no longer change certificate trust <body> Following the update to Mountain lion, I can no longer "trust" a certificate associated with my JNLP file.  This worked previously. Following going through the "trust" dialogue, the next screen is still stuck on "deny" as the only option.  Any Ideas?    <answer61246> Same here. Very frustrating - I've followed all the steps to include the offending certificate in Keychain Access but in the end am only left with one option - Deny.
