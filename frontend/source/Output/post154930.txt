how to move iTunes files from external and internal drives to a single drive? <body> I'm trying to merge two different iTunes libraries.  The bigger one (on an external HD) is the default library, so I am trying to open the smaller one (on the internal HD) to export it.  However, as the first step of this I need to option+click and hold down option while iTunes is loading.  It then prompts me to enter the location of the library to open, and I select the location of the smaller directory.  However as soon as iTunes comes up it appears no different than when the default, larger library is loaded.  When I go to preferences it still says the location is the location of the larger library!  What am I doing wrong?  Update: I tried renaming the external library so iTunes couldn't find it, but it still showed up! When I tried exporting to see what would happen, I got a mixture of both internal and external paths in the resulting XML file.  I tried doing the same thing when not trying to open a different library and got the same result.  So it looks like somehow iTunes has files in both places, but I need to move everything into a single location (internally), so how can I do this?  To clarify, I have two iTunes folders, one on an external HD and one on the internal HD, and it appears that when I open iTunes it knows about both folders.  I only want one folder (on the internal drive) so that, for instance, if I disconnect the external HD things don't get confused or messed up.  <answer154936> Turns out that somehow the internal iTunes got imported into the external one without changing the location of the files.  So I went to:  precodeFile &gt; Library &gt; Organize Library &gt; Consolidate Files /code/pre  which caused it to move the files into the external drive library.
