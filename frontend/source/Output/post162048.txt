Missing menu items from the Apple Menu <body> Somehow in the past 24 hours, I have only a basic menu for the Apple Menu and my early 2011 MBP running Yosemite 10.10.1 also always starts up in the Simple Finder. I especially miss the Recent Items in the Apple Menu. No idea what happened.  When I login as a different user the Apple menu is "normal". How do I repair the broken user  Apple menu? Both user accounts I have are admin accounts. I tried turning off Parental Controls for the affected user account but Simple Finder persists   <answer162079> I finally found a terminal command for changing the Simple Finder interface back to the Standard interface and it did the trick ;)  precodedefaults write com.apple.finder InterfaceLevel standard;killall Finder /code/pre  Got this from http://www.amsys.co.uk/2013/blog/how-to-quickly-enable-os-x-finders-simple-finder-mode/#.VI9WasZINv1  Thanks for the troubleshoot suggestions. It helped get me headed in the right direction.   <comment189360> Is it the same if you log in as different user ? <comment189367> Simple Finder is a Parental Controlâ€¦ Is your account an admin account?
