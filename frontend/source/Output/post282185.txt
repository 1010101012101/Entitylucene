How do I get different colors for directories, etc. in iTerm2? <body> I have a new MacBookPro, and I installed the latest release of iTerm2.   Even after I imported various color schemes, I notice that they just change the color of the text and background only.   What I was expecting to see were different colors for files VS directories, VS hidden files, etc etc. How do I do that on iTerm2?   A related question is how do I actually emspecify/em what I want the colors of directories, files, etc to be?  Thanks  <answer282189> You have to do two things:  ul liset the codeLSCOLORS/code environment variable/li licreate an alias for codels/code so that it shows colors by default/li /ul  In your code~/.bash_profile/code add the following:  precodeexport LSCOLORS="EHfxcxdxBxegecabagacad"   alias ls='ls -lGH'        &lt;-----This shows in list format, follow symlinks colorized /code/pre  The the colors are set by each bit above; the first being foreground and the second being background.   The first two characters refer to directories having a bold blue foreground and a light grey background.  However, there's a great online utility to see what each of the colors mean and look like in real time.  It will even generate the "code" for you.  (I am not affiliated with this at all).  It will work in both MacOS/FreeBSD and Linux.  Make sure you select the BSD option for macOS.

If you've got Homebrew installed, install codegrc/code with codebrew install grc/code -  this will set up aliases automatically, including for codels/code. It comes with aliases and config files for many different commands, and it's (relatively) trivial to hack a config file using Python regular expressions for any command that codegrc/code doesn't currently cover (codetmutil/code and codelaunchctl/code, for example).  (I was going to add this to the question I flagged as a possible dupe, but with your edit it's probably more useful here!)  <comment355297> Possible duplicate of [Changing color of folders, files, execs on iTerm2](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/258406/changing-color-of-folders-files-execs-on-iterm2) <comment355299> Thanks @JohnN, that helped, but please see my edit. <comment355303> Hi Allan, thanks! A couple questions, can you explain some more about i) Why I have to put it in .bash_profile and not say, the .zshrc I think it was, and ii) a little bit more about the export LSCOLORS part? Do I go to that site you mentioned and set my color scheme from there? How does this jive then with the color schemes of iterm2? Thanks! <comment355307> Perhaps this is what is confusing me: I am using iterm2. What does this mean for which file we change? (.bash_profile VS .zshrc)? For what it's worth, on this new machine I currently have neither... <comment355309> Ah, ok, the echo shows `bash`. So I should make a new ~/.bash_profile I am guessing since none exists. <comment355312> Very helpful, thank you!
