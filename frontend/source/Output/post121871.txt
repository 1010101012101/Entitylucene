command-delete key remapping <body> I have remapped one of my top-left keys (kbd`/kbd) to the backward-delete key (kbd⌫/kbd). However the command-delete shortcut (kbd⌘/kbd+kbd⌫/kbd) to "move to trash" works only on the original kbd⌫/kbd key but not on the remapped key. Any suggestion?  I have remapped the key using Ukelele. I entered code"&amp;#x0008";/code as the identifier for kbd⌫/kbd.  [fyi: purpose is to symmetrize and reduce wrist pain; likewise I remapped caps-lock to enter/return; I'm a customized Dvorak keyboard user; first experience on a Mac]  <answer121989> Try using KeyRemap4MacBook instead. Save a file like this as code~/Library/Application Support/KeyRemap4MacBook/private.xml/code:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;   &lt;item&gt;     &lt;name&gt;test&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;identifier&gt;test&lt;/identifier&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::BACKQUOTE, KeyCode::DELETE&lt;/autogen&gt;   &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  Then open the KeyRemap4MacBook application, press the ReloadXML button, and tick the checkbox for the setting.  <comment142314> Thanks Lauri, I won't have time to try this for a couple of days as my laptop is getting an upgrade, but will try asap.
