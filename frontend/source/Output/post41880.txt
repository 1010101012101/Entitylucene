iPhone not i.d.'ing callers after resetting all settings <body> I used strongSettings  General  Reset  Reset All Settings/strong on my iPhone, and now incoming phone calls are displayed as the telephone number, rather than the name from my Contacts.    I do notice that the telephone numbers in my Contacts app are (now?) emsimply a string of 10 digits, rather than being formatted/em.  I'm pretty sure it was formatted at one point.  Thought it might have something to do with strongInternational Assist/strong, but turning that on or off doesn't change this.  I don't recall having to set anything initially to enable caller i.d., so I don't know what setting might have been reset.  Suggestions?  Thanks!  <answer41939> The solution to my problem turned out to be reactivating my (Verizon) phone.  Details here: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3766509
