How to modify the Shift key so you don't have to release it prior to another combination? <body> As a typical Windows user I am used to some of the features there.   The kbdShift/kbd and kbdCmd/kbd keys on my MBP are just killing me.  Everytime I press them for a combination and then want to use them again for another combination/capital letter I have to let them go and press again.   I looked at codeKarabiner/code's settings and in codepreferences/code, but couldn't find any setting to avoid that. Is there a way?  <comment281365> This is not the default behavior of these keys! Usually you don't have to release them before entering another key combo. <comment281366> Are you saying you can't hold down Shift then type two letters and have them both be capitalized? If so then I think there's something weird/broken with your keyboard or OS. <comment281367> @Mordred I can do that, but for example what I can't do is: press Cmd + Shift to change input language(karabiner setting), then hold Shift without releasing it for a capital. <comment281369> First thing I'd do is test without Karabiner <comment281370> @Tetsujin Will test this on first chance and update my question accordingly :) <comment281398> It may be Karabiner: my test of just creating a new private window (`command + shift + n`) then typing whilst continuing to hold `shift` does indeed have caps.
