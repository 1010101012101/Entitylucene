dictionary/text <body> I have an iphone 6. It has the 9 update. Suddenly the dictionary has disappeared completely when I text. I had the option of showing the words to select or not. Now, I have no options. It has disappeared altogether. I went reset the dictionary and nothing has helped. I turned the phone off completely as well to reset and it still is not there. Help!  <answer228332> You probably turned QuickType suggestions off. To fix this, long press the keyboard selection icon (the globe in the bottom left of your keyboard) and turn "Predictive" back on.   You can also go to Settings → General → Keyboard and turn on the "Predictive" switch.  <comment278304> Do you mean the dictionary that you use to define words? Or the three suggested words that appear at the top of the keyboard when you are typing? <comment278310> The suggestions probably got hidden.  Is there a little white line above the t and y keys?  If so drag it upward.
