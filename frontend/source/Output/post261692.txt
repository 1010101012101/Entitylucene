I don't have permissions to open my files? <body> There are several questions that seem similar, e.g., TextEdit shows dialogs about not having permission to open any files, but they're not exactly the same and none of the suggested fixes work.  Correction: when I posted, I forgot that strongone/strong of the ideas in those posts I hadn't tried.  Because I was doing a long slow backup via rsync, I did not reboot.  This morning after that completed, a reboot has removed the problem.  But it would still be nice to understand why, and how to prevent—strongsince it happened again today/strong (see comments).  For more than a month, I've been using the "re-open windows on login" option to keep a few Textedit files easily accessible.  No problem noted with an occasional save or opening a new one.  But today, I cannot save any of them nor open any new ones in my home directory.

You may have to fix your user folder. A MalwareBytes scan doesn't examine all files. It uses a signature file to determine threats and scans certain files/folders only. Depending on your system it takes ~2-5 minutes <comment327750> I repeat: there are no ACLs anywhere in /Users on my MBP.  Any that were there were removed by me long ago in response to bugs in Time Machine.  And if any were replaced by the system, they were removed as soon as this problem appeared (and verified gone by 'ls -laet@')  An antivirus scanner that only scans part of potentially infected files is useless.  And if it only skipped SIP-protected directories, it would not have finished in a few microseconds.  It did take about two minutes AFTER the upgrade to the latest version. <comment327753> MB is **no** antivirus app. If you  **removed** all ACLs, you should add this – instead of writing "There are no ACLs.." – because that's not the system's default. <comment329630> So, happens again.  I have a few files open in TextEdit.  At least two are new, and one I have been editing/saving several times today.  Created a new one and tried to open it: "don't have permission"  Tried to save one of the other new ones (so that I can reboot as before without losing it) and I don't have permission for that either.  AARRGGHH. <comment329638> Perhaps a silly question, but have you booted into recovery partition and run Disk Utility to check for and repair permissions issues? That would be my very first step here if I were asked to resolve a situation like this. <comment329654> I have not bothered with "repair permissions" because I know the shell commands to make sure I have permissions.  And, as I stated, other programs are able to read and write the same files.  Somehow the user ID of Textedit changes WHILE it is running, or there is some odd mechanism that bases permissions on the app instead of the user.  Also, if it is fixed by doing nothing more than rebooting, it's not the file permissions, even though the error messages claim it is. <comment358746> My MBP is currently half a world away, but this really appears to describe the problem.
