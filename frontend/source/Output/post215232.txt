Calendar event becomes invite iOS 9 <body> I installed iOS 9 (then 9.1). After that when i edit a calendar event on my iPhone (6 plus or 5s) it appears as a Invite in outlook (2013) on my PC. Got Office 365 that i manage myself. Really wierd. I got full rights read/write (set to owner) so it doesn't seem to be a owner issue...  Any ideas why this happens?  I tried with an old iPhone 4 (iOS 7.1.2) and that does not change the event.  <answer215239> I've been experiencing the exact same issue.  Outlook 2013 which synchronizes with Office 365, I-Phone 6S Plus with IOS 9.1    If I modify or create a calendar entry on my I-phone, it changes the calendar entry to an invite in Outlook.  In Outlook the calendar entry is shown with a semi-colon and followed by my name.    If I open the calendar entry, the To... field is displayed empty and an information message: "You haven't sent this meeting invitation yet."  If I click on "Cancel Invitation", the entry becomes a calendar entry again and the Invite disappears...  Until I edit it with the I-Phone.  Hmmm...  <comment260237> Obviously it's a iOS 9 issue. At first i thought they had switched or add some new features to the calendar function, but when i compare it to older bersions of iOS i can't seem to figure out what
