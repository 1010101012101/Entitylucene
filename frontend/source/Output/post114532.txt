How can you sync "learned spellings" between Macs <body> OSX always tries to autocorrect the the unix commands that I save into my note taking application.   To prevent this, I right click and tell OSX to "Learn Spelling".   Is there a way to teach this spelling to all my Mac's? Ideally using iCloud or dropbox.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MdQjl.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer114562> strongThe spellings are located in various files in code~/Library/Spelling/code./strong Namely, LocalDictionary and various localisation files such as en_GB.
