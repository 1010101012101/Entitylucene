Hide the clock on the iPhone 6+ lockscreen <body> Is there no way to hide the clock on the iPhone 6+ lock screen?  <answer266047> This is not possible without jailbreaking.  <answer275088> I did this for my gf with some simple photoshopping, works like a charm, you will never see the time again.  ul lihttp://images.fzilla.com/images/renaa.png/li lihttp://images.fzilla.com/images/zsunnyslut.png/li /ul  <comment345988> Can you elaborate on what you actually did so others can reproduce it with images of their own?
