An analytics/statistical tool for Podcasts <body> I have podcasts stored on my Mac Mini Server.  It is in iTunes but others can add the XML link to other RSS readers.  Is there Apple software available where I can keep track of the number of downloads of each video from my Mac Mini Server?  I do not know how to describe the software I'm looking for but I have seen this type of information when I have subscribed to a similar service where the company created podcasts for us and we could see the number of downloads of each file.  <comment169229> I presume your Mac Mini is running 10.7 or later and have edited the tags appropriatelyâ€”if this is not the case feel free to edit back.
