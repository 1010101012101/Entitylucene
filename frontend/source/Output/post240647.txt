Is there a way to get a screenshot / snapshot of a movie purchased on iTunes? <body> Using kbd⌘/kbdkbdShift/kbdkbd3/kbd or kbd⌘/kbdkbdShift/kbdkbd4/kbd won't work -- it will capture a grey window. (I think it is due to the video being displayed using the video card's video buffer).  I think one way is to use an iPad and play the movie and take a screenshot by the Home and Power button together, but other than that, is there a way to take it on the Mac, without installing any additional program?  <answer240650> You can't take a screenshot of a protected video with the stock Mac tools.  Apple has built-in protection to prevent this from happening (if the video is not protected, then it's ok to take a screenshot).  The only way you'll be able to do this is to use a third-party video player, like VLC, or a third-party image capture, like SnapNDrag.  <comment296965> if using VLC, can it play any DRM movies purchased from iTunes? <comment296970> I'm not sure about that, I've never tried it.  Hopefully, someone here can answer that question. <comment354284> I've tried the iPad method. Still gives a grey screen. It's a security issue, not a video issue. The best I can offer is taking a camera and taking a picture of your screen - old-school.
