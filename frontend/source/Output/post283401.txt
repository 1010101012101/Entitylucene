Core Storage location <body> Where are the Core Storage instructions stored?  In Kevin White's emmacOS Support Essentials 10.12/em, White says     The second partition, occupying the final ~650 MB of the disk is an "Apple_Boot" formatted volume that contains the Recovery HD system. Aside from providing macOS Recovery functionality, strongthis second partition is intentionally not managed by Core Storage, since it provides the software necessary for a Mac computer's ... firmware to understand Core Storage volumes./strong   If a Mac does not have a Recovery HD volume, is it not eligible for Core Storage?   Will FileVault work? and if so, how does it support encryption during use?  <answer285099> Without a recovery partition you can't enable FileVault 2:  https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204837     "Without a Recovery System, FileVault won't encrypt your startup drive."   I'll bet CoreStorage volumes will work, just probably not encrypted ones.  <comment357281> What do you mean with "instuctions"! The part of your quotation in **bold** is **wrong**! <comment357283> Whatever information is used which allows your machine to utilize Core Storage. White explains it as if the instruction set for Core Storage is saved on the Recovery HD - I was just very curious how that worked. <comment357284> The Recovery HD is needed to **boot** a FileVault system volume because an intermediate encryption key is stored there, but it's not required to boot a non-encrypted CS volume or decrypt a FV volume (even a system volume).
