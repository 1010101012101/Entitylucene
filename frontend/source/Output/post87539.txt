Can't switch iMessages on <body> I can't switch iMessages ON anymore (it was ON). When I try to flip the switch from OFF to ON it instantly returns to OFF (I don't see any message like "activating...", it just doens't flip). So I don't think it's a server problem because the iPhone isn't even trying to connect. It's like te switch is broken.  I try'ed/checked  ul lirestart/li lihard reset/li liresetting the iPhone settings/li lichanging Wifi network and switching to mobile internet/li lithere are no restrictions (they are off)/li liFacetime works (I can turn it on/off)/li liDate &amp; time are correct/li liI can send iMessages via Messages on my iMac/li liGoogling/li liPlain SMS messages work fine/li liI can log in and out on my iCloud account/li /ul  I did make a change to my AppleID. Move my mobile number from "home number" to "mobile number" (http://snag.gy/ze6Ip.jpg) because iMessages didn't work with my mobile number anymore. I tried reverting this changed without succes.  Anyone has an idea how I can fix this?  <answer87551> I created a new (iCloud) backup, wiped the phone and restored my backup. Not really a decent solution, but iMessages works again and I didn't lose anything.  <comment102329> Try logging out iCloud on your phone and log back in? <comment102330> Just to be sure: You are able to send plain SMS messages (because a "silent" SMS will be sent when activating iMessage)? <comment102331> @Robuust Logging in (and out) works <comment102332> @cyphorious plain SMS messages work fine <comment102346> @JeroenVdb so issue solved now? <comment102369> Yes, backup-wipe-restoring my iPhone worked for me. Just logging in/out didn't help.
