What's the meaning/use of ?mt=8 and ?mt=12 in iTunes Preview and Mac App Store Preview URLs? <body> h2Examples/h2  precodehttp://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wuala/id417749289?mt=8&amp;ls=1 /code/pre     precodehttp://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/wuala/id417749289?mt=8 /code/pre     precodehttp://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/visualdiffer/id412386481?mt=12&amp;ls=1 /code/pre     precodehttp://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/visualdiffer/id412386481?mt=12 /code/pre  h3Friendlier URLs/h3  I dislike the effect of codels=1/code (launch App Store.app or iTunes.app) so I never share URLs in that format – I habitually remove that part of the URL.   I also habitually remove parts such as code?mt=8/code and code?mt=12/code – they seem superfluous. So for example:    ul lihttp://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/wuala/id417749289/li lihttp://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/visualdiffer/id412386481/li /ul  h1Questions/h1  Does either code?mt=8/code or code?mt=12/code add value to the end user?  If not to the end user, how do those things add value?  <answer90500> MT stands for emmedia type/em.  You can find known values in the answer to similar question.  Because there’s usually an ID in URL, it may seem odd, but according to another answer to that same question, the codemt/code query parameter helps the operating system to launch the right store in the right app.  For example on iOS, you may see sometimes that links open the iTunes app first and then the iBookstore in the iBooks app.  Other times, the iBookstore is opened right away.  That is why codemt/code should be part of iTunes and why you should probably use iTunes Link Maker.  <answer239274> mt - media type  mt-8 = mobile development software   mt-12 = desktop apps   1   Music 2   Podcasts 3   Audiobooks 4   TV Shows 5   Music Videos 6   Movies 7   iPod Games 8   Mobile Software Applications 9   Ringtones 10  iTunes U 11  E-Books 12  Desktop Apps  <comment106243> There's an annoyance with iTunes Link Maker: its URLs for Mac apps differ from the URLs that are seen when links are  followed … but I blame these discrepancies on Apple. This is a great answer. <comment294049> The same list is provided by (linked from) the accepted answer.
