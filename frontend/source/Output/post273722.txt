Openssl Decrypt passphrase trough ssh <body> I want to read an encrypted file. I can do this by the following commands:  precode openssl des3 -d -k "passprhase" -in crypt_file|cat  openssl des3 -d -kfile file-which-contains-the-passphase -in crypt_file|cat /code/pre  Now I want to do that using SSH. The passphrase will be stored into remote machine.I wont to write something like this:  precode openssl des3 -d -k $(ssh remote@192.168.1.X cat file) -in cript|cat /code/pre  But this command does't work  <comment344110> Does the passphrase (from the remote file) contain characters which the shell treats special? Does running `ssh remote@192.168.1.X cat file` work (without spurious output or user interaction)?
