Error configuring mcrypt after upgrading to El Capitan <body> I am facing the following issue after upgrading to El Capitan. It says:  precodeInstalling shared extensions: /usr/lib/php/extensions/no-debug-non-zts-20121212/ cp: /usr/lib/php/extensions/no-debug-non-zts-20121212/#INST@826#: Operation not permitted /code/pre  while running sudo make install in mcrypt/php-5.6.13/ext/mcrypt folder. I think this is due to SIP but what is the other way round.  h2What is SIP and how do I know if it's causing this error?/h2  <answer208816> Yes, this is due to SIP. So the two options you have are  ul lidisable SIP entirely /li liraise a defect/support request against mcrypt to use code/usr/local/code instead of code/usr/code for installation/li /ul  <answer209524> El Capitan adds a new security feature named System Integrity Protection (SIP). Among other things, SIP prevents parties other than Apple from adding, deleting or modifying directories and files stored in certain directories:  precode/bin /sbin /usr /System /code/pre  Apple has indicated that the following directories are available for developers to access:  precode/usr/local /Applications /Library ~/Library /code/pre  All directories in code/usr/code except for code/usr/local/code are protected by SIP.  For more information on SIP, please see this post:  https://derflounder.wordpress.com/2015/10/01/system-integrity-protection-adding-another-layer-to-apples-security-model/  <answer214994> There is no need to disable System Integrity Protection to install php extensions. Just create a suitable directory in /usr/local, and use the INSTALL_ROOT variable. e.g.   precode% mkdir -p /usr/local/php56_ext /code/pre  and in your extension directory:  precode% INSTALL_ROOT=/usr/local/php56_ext make install /code/pre  You will need to activate the extension using the full path, so in your php.ini, you will need the line:  precodeextension=/usr/local/php56_ext/usr/lib/php/extensions/no-debug-non-zts-20121212/mcrypt.so /code/pre  <answer236950> After reading @user980575's response (which is a bit redundant with directories) and a comment on Coolest Guide's On The Planet's post regarding this subject (which requires manually editing your code./configure/code script) I came up with an alternative solution. Overriding the codeEXTENSION_DIR/code on the fly.   It took a little trial and error but when you're ready to actually perform the install after phpizing (is that a word?) simply make the directory:  precodemkdir -p /usr/local/lib/php/extensions /code/pre  And then run:  precode./configure  make  sudo make EXTENSION_DIR='/usr/local/lib/php/extensions' install /code/pre  Now that the extension is placed in a non-protected directory you just have to update your codephp.ini/code to point to the extension with the full path.  precodeextension=/usr/local/lib/php/extensions/mcrypt.so /code/pre  <comment252382> I'm facing the same problem, what's SIP and how do I disable it? <comment252427> Please use the search field on top right <comment252784> For those wanting to disable SIP, there's a separate post that discusses this: [http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/208478/how-do-i-disable-system-integrity-protection-sip-aka-rootless-on-max-os-x-el](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/208478/how-do-i-disable-system-integrity-protection-sip-aka-rootless-on-max-os-x-el)
