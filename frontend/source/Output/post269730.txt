Launchpad keeps rearrarining icons <body> I've tried different apps, tried removing some config in MAC and still every time I reboot my MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015)running macOS Sierra I lose my launchpad layout. All of the apps are set to their default position.  Anyone have a solution on how to fix this?  Kr, Vincent  <answer269732> I don't know what you've tried thus far but a solution I've found to work well in the past for Launchpad issues is just to force reset the Launchpad back to its default settings. Most people don't enjoy doing this because it requires you to then set everything back up the way you like it afterwards, but at this point that's what you're having to do after every restart anyways, emso what have you got to lose/em?  To force reset Launchpad back to default settings:  ul liLaunch Terminal.app/li liemCarefully/em type the following: strongdefaults write com.apple.dock ResetLaunchPad -bool true; killall/strong/li liWait until you notice the Dock refresh; this means the process is complete/li /ul  I would then only move a couple things around in Launchpad for time's sake (in case this didn't work) and then restart your Mac to test!  If that did not work, simply force-resetting may have not be enough. Maybe it wasn't just the defined settings inside of the file that were corrupt, but the entire file itself. If this is the case, we need to delete/remove the file and trigger the OS to create a brand new one. You have two options for this!  Option A)  ol liNavigate to ~/Library/Application Support/Dock (yes, Dock!) /li liMove any files in this folder to your Desktop (except for the one called 'desktoppicture.db' if one is present)/li liRestart the Mac/li liMove a few app icons around in Launchpad to suit your liking/li liRestart the Mac again to test/li liIf the issue is resolved and no new problems occur you can move the files(s) we relocated to the Desktop to the Trash; if issue still occurs (and especially if any new issues are occurring), move the file(s) on your Desktop back into the ~/Library/Application Support/Dock folder and choose "Replace" if prompted, then restart your Mac./li /ol  Option B)  ul liNavigate to ~/Library/Application Support/Dock/li liMove 'desktoppicture.db' to your Desktop (if the file exists)/li liLaunch Terminal/li liCarefully type the following: strongrm ~/Library/Application\ Support/Dock/*.db ; killall Dock/strong/li liRestart your Mac/li liMove 'desktoppicture.db' from your Desktop back to ~/Library/Application Support/Dock (if it was present in the first place)/li liMove a few app icons around in Launchpad to suit your liking/li liRestart the Mac again to test (your background should also be back to normal if it had been changed during this process)/li /ul  <comment338881> I did all that, still the same problem :( <comment338882> Unfortunately if these steps did not resolve your issue, you're stuck with it for now. This issue has been around since 2011 and Apple has not fixed it yet... There are many reports of it online and the steps I posted have been known to resolve the issue for some people but not for all. I'm sorry to hear that they didn't work for you! I do have a question for you though! Do you know if this issue occurs in more than one user account?
