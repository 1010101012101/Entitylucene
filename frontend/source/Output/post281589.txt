Why not just keep the old one? Accounts are transferable to new devices. Can even be used on several personal devices. <comment354320> I changed the old iCloud account because our family shares the same iCloud account and the things being downloaded by my relatives keep on syncing in the iPhone, so yeah I changed the iCloud account to avoid the syncing of things I don't want in the iPhone.
