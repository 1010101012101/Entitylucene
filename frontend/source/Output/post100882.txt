Can I backup using Time Machine and restore to another account? <body> I am planning to re-install the OSX when Mavericks release. I am also actually planning to change my username after re-installation.  I need to backup my whole personal folder under username "a", but if I changed my username to "b", Can I still be restoring my personal data to "b"?  I know generally there is no problem for this, but I am wondering if iTunes library still recognise my new username and locate my every music file location?  <answer100885> You cannot directly restore to another account from Time Machine, but you can rename the user emafter/em the restore. After the fresh installation of OS X, restore the data and then do the user rename.  Follow the process outlined in Changing user account short name to rename your user "a" to user "b".  <comment118758> Thanks, but will my iTunes recognise the library's songs and Podcasts after renaming my account? It is most important thing that I concern. <comment118760> Yes, it will. iTunes does not really depend on your OS X login username. As long as your iTunes store account is the same, things should be fine with all your media. Note that I mentioned renaming the user *after* the data restore.
