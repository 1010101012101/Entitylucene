Cannot erase HD partition - Could not find partition to expand, first partition on the disk? <body> My current HD status is img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0hTqt.png" alt="enter image description here"  When I try to remove the "Free" partition, the log returns "Could not find partition to expand, first partition on the disk?"  What can I do?  <answer143821> I would suggest to proceed as follows:  ol liStop Time Machine,/li liMigrate your backups from: codeTime Machine - …/code to codeFree/code. If required, refer to this Apple technical note: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5096/li liSuppress your now useless codeTine Machine - …/code partition.  ⇒ codeFree/code should now use your full disk/li liRename your codeFree/code partition to something more practical./li liRestart Time Machine and tell it to make the backup where you want./li /ol  <comment169412> No, I'm admin. Erase and RAID & Restore is showed only when you select a partition, in the image is selected the disk. <comment169414> I get First Aid, Erase, Partition, RAID, Restore - if I select just a Volume, then just Partition disappears. I also have far more technical info in the bottom section. I don't know whether it's truly relevant, but it looks like you're not seeing half the potential info. <comment169421> What do you mean by REMOVE the partition.? <comment169427> @Tetsujin it's formatted as a LVG because it's encrypted. That's why those tabs are missing. <comment169428> Can you please update your post with the output of the following command entered in Terminal: `diskutil list; echo; diskutil cs list`
