mouse move wakes up sleeping mac.. how to prevent? <body> When the cleaning man has been by my desk then my computer wakes up from sleep. How can I make it insensitive to mouse movements?  <answer12475> If it is a bluetooth mouse you can disable it waking the computer by unchecking   precodeAllow Bluetooth devices to wake this computer. /code/pre  in System Preferences - Bluetooth - Advanced  This will also effect the wireless keyboard waking the Mac so you will need to use the power button to wake it.  <comment13034> is it a bluetooth mouse? <comment13036> the mouse is connected with a cable. A bluetooth device.. hmm, good idea. <comment13040> Yeah with bluetooth you have this option. Not with wired :( <comment13067> You have this option with a wired mouse. Unplug it.
