I can't seem to set custom zoom keyboard shortcuts for Microsoft Excel 2016 <body> I'd like to be able to do "cmd +" to zoom in and "cmd -" to zoom out. I tried setting "Zoom In" on the app shortcuts on the keyboard (under System Preferences).  Currently I'm just relying on the default Excel shortcut of Cntrl + scrolling.  I found a discussion that seemed to suggest that App Shortcuts work for other Excel commands. I wonder if I'm just not naming it correctly by saying "Zoom In"  https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_excel-mso_mac/how-to-customize-keyboard-shortcuts-in-excel-for/7000a4e9-5d38-410e-b763-80989f4d99f0  Appreciate any tips!
