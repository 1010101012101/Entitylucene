How can I block the News app on iOS? <body> I need to block the app. Which domain names does it use? Can I use content restriction like Safari? Can I block the IP addresses in my router?  <answer255150> If you want to prevent usage of the app completely, you can enable restrictions (Settings  General  Restrictions) and turn off the toggle for News.  iOS 10 also lets you delete default apps like News, but keep in mind that it could be re-downloaded from the App Store (unless you enable the restriction for Installing Apps too).  <comment317701> If upgrading to iOS 10 is an option for you, the app can be deleted.
