Clipboard changes characters when coping from editor to terminal <body> I have some very weird behaviour with Terminal in OSX 10.11.6. When copy/pasting a lot of text (commands) from TextEdit to Terminal window, only some rare characters were exchanged:  precodeDirks17:_960 dirk$ mv /Volumes/Unser/Unser/Fotos/2010/2010_08_12_18_Dresden/_m60/IMG_087568_2010.08.15-23.26.24_EOS5D2_.JPG /Volumes/Unser/Unser/Fotos/2010/2010_08_12_18_Dresden/_960/IMG_087568_2010.08.15-23.26.24_EOS5D2_.JPG                                                                            _____ Dirks17:_960 dirk$ mv /Volumes/Unser/Unser/Fotos/2010/2010_08_12_18_Dresden/_960/IMG_087568_2010.08.15-23.26.24_EOS5D2_.JPG /Volumes/Unser/Unser/Fotos/2010/2010_08_12_18_Dresden/_960/IMG_087568_2010.08.15-23.26.24_EOS5D2_.JPG /code/pre  The underlined "m" in the first row should not be there. It is a "9" (see correct row below). When copying the same row individually, everything arrives correctly. Any idea what's happening and how to avoid it?  <comment327199> Are you copy/pasting text from a RTF format (the default) TextEdit document, or are you first making the content Plain Text using the Format menu  Make Plain Text command? I suggest you copy/paste only Plain Text content.
