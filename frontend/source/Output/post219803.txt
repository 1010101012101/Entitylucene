grep: command not found <body> This is a very weird behavior. Lately, whenever I am trying to find a process on console with codeps aux | grep foo/code, it is returning a codegrep: command not found/code. Ok, that could be something that I changed and did wrong, but the problem is that, after a few tries, it suddenly knows what codegrep/code is:  precodeMM:.dev$ ps aux | grep foo -bash:  grep: command not found MM:.dev$ ps aux | grep foo -bash:  grep: command not found MM:.dev$ ps aux | grep foo -bash:  grep: command not found MM:.dev$ ps aux | grep foo MM            70953   0,0  0,0  2699108    744   ??  Ss   10:32AM   0:08.77 foo bar MM             3756   0,0  0,0  2423356    204 s004  R+   10:12AM   0:00.00 grep foo /code/pre  Any ideas why is this happening?  As suggested, this is what I get when a enter codetype grep/code after both, the one failing and the one working:  precodeMM:.dev$ ps aux | grep foo -bash:  grep: command not found MM:.dev$ type grep grep is /usr/bin/grep MM:.dev$ ps aux | grep foo MM             5694   0,0  0,0  2433796    676 s006  S+   10:47AM   0:00.00 grep foo MM:.dev$ type grep grep is /usr/bin/grep /code/pre  <answer219806> Looking at your output, there seems to be an extra space before codegrep/code in the error message. I assume this is coming from a still pressed kbdOpt/Alt/kbd key after typing the pipe symbol (so you basically are typing kbdOpt/kbd-kbdSpace/kbd instead of just kbdSpace/kbd). Try codeps aux |grep foo/code (without a space between the pipe and the codeg/code).  <answer219807> My answer may sound strange, but I had this effect with an old keyboard as well when I typed too fast. Just try typing it again, move with your cursor before the letter "g" of grep, delete the whitespace that could have been entered with a still pressed kbdALT/Option/kbd key, hit the space key again and fire up your commandline.   Another workaround is to lower the keyboard repeat rate in System Preferences, if you are not typing with ten fingers. :-)  <comment265838> Strange. Do you retype the command every time or just scroll back in the command history? <comment265839> I was about to write that. When I scroll back it does not work. If I write it back, it doesn't work either. But if I scroll back and delete the `grep` and the pipe, it eventually works. O_O <comment265845> That's it :D Normally, I use emacs, and there when I accidentally type Opt+Space I can see something similar to `_`. So in the terminal, I was just missing that. Thanks :) <comment265846> That was it! @patrix suggested that too. Stupid of me for not realizing, but sometimes I just want to type too fast. Thanks. <comment341141> Oh my god.. happened so often to me and that was simply it. how silly! <comment366481> this has happened so many times to me, thanks so much for your answer, really appreciate it, i'll be sure to type |grep from now on !! I've been wondering about this one for years!
