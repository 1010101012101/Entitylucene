How to add a Google calendar shared with me, to my iCloud calendars <body> A colleague has shared her Google calendar with me. It appears in Google calendar just fine. In the calendar settings I can see the iCal URL, but when I attempt to subscribe to that address in Apple Calendar, it says "A calendar wasn't found on ... Check the URL.".  I suspect this is because the calendar is shared with my via my Google account, rather than been made public. Is there anyway to sync the calendar with my Apple devices? Can I re-share it from my Google account so I can subscribe to it from iCloud?  I tried the syncselect option, which sounded promising, but couldn't see anything happen. I'm not sure how it would work anyway, since I can't see how it would have access to my iCloud account.  <answer282393> Inadvertently found a lovely solution:  ol liGo to System Preferences-Internet Accounts/li liAdd or select your Google account/li liClick the checkbox next to "Calendars"/li /ol  Voila, all my Google Calendar calendars appear in Apple Calendar, including the one shared with me. Didn't think there was going to be a solution to this, but so simple once you know.
