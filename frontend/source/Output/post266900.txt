Click a button on floating window using AppleScript <body> I'm having issues getting an AppleScript to run for an app called AutoRate. The script below was originally made for version 1.5.5. I've already tried to mess with AppleScript to get it to run on 1.6, but because I've never really used AppleScript before I'm not getting anywhere. The picture shows 1.6 on top and 1.5.5 on the bottom. The 2nd photo shows the hierarchy for 1.6. Any help is appreciated.  precodetell application "AutoRate"     activate     -- Hide app      tell application "System Events" to key code 4 using {command down}     -- Press 'begin rating'      tell button "Begin" of window 2 "main" to perform action     -- Try to quit afterwards      quit end tell /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3oVHt.jpg" alt="AutoRate 1.5.5 on top.
