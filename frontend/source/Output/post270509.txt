Terminal has been unstable since last upgrade (OSX 10.12.2) <body> I have had repeated Terminal.app crashes while working with the command line, whether on the local computer or shelled into a Linux VPS.  Is this a known issue? Are there alternative CLI terminal applications that will behave like terminal, only at least being more stable?  Thanks,  <answer270845> I never had a crash on the Terminal application because I never used it (or mostly never). So, I can't answer your first question.  About your second question, yes, there is a objectively better terminal emulator for macOS:     strongiTerm 2/strong is a replacement for Terminal and the successor to iTerm. It   works on Macs with macOS 10.8 or newer. iTerm2 brings the terminal   into the modern age with features you never knew you always wanted.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JRWW9.png" alt="screenshot"  I've been using iTerm 2 since I have the iMac and I never missed any feature of the Terminal application. Also, iTerm 2 is open source software.  <answer271936> To answer your other question: "Is this a known issue?", I have been having problems with Terminal.app crashing too, and this post seems to suggest that the issue is known to Apple.   <comment340188> I would recommend you [iTerm](https://www.iterm2.com). <comment340459> @Helio, please restate your comment as an answer so I can accept it. Thanks... <comment340478> Here you go! However, it doesn't deserve to be an answer. If you provide me more information about the crash, maybe I can help you.
