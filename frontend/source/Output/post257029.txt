How can I create a user account without password? <body> I'm trying to create a second user account with limited permissions which I can use as a honeypot if someone steals my MacBook, but it refuses to allow a standard user without a password. Is there a way to work around this?  <answer257046> Write the password clearly within the password hint field. You might have to surround it with some extra non-password text.  For example, the hint â€”     Forgot your 9-character password? It's not qwerty1234 of course   would be crackable (probably first time) by any kid who thinks about it for five seconds. Mac OS will allow multiple attempts.  <comment320746> I'd just pick an easy to guess password. If I were going to steal a laptop, I'd assume an unprotected account had nothing valuable in it and spend my time trying to get into the protected account. <comment320773> Why would you want an account with no password? <comment321038> @OzzieSpin I explained this in my question.
