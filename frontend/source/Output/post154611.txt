airport express airplay, kill core audio <body> i have regular computer speakers plugged into my airport express router, and play music via airplay from my iphone and macbook pro.  i usually select airplay on my macbook pro by holding alt and clicking the volume icon in the status bar, and selecting my airport express.  sometimes this doesn't work, and my selection won't stick. and instead of restarting and interrupting my wifi each time, i found from a number of google search results, like macrumors forums, to use these either of these codes in terminal:  precodesudo killall coreaudiod /code/pre  and  precodesudo kill `ps -ax | grep 'coreaudiod' | grep 'sbin' |awk '{print $1}'` /code/pre  will these make any permanent changes that i should undo? if so, how can it be undone?  they seemed to work, but now sometimes it will say i connect fine to the airport express, but no audio comes out of the speakers... neither from my laptop nor iphone.  sometimes i'll reboot the computer, unplugging the router for 30s... and tested the speakers to be working when hard wired. but it doesn't help. then a day later it will work...  any thoughts? thanks,  <comment181898> The commands listed simply kill running processes, which should either restart themselves or start up again when the whole system is rebooted. They do not do anything permanent. <comment181900> I wouldn't recommend using terminal commanda containing sudo if you don't know what they do exactly. <comment182083> ok cool, hopefully the problem doesn't come back. i thought it was just a quicker way to restart the audio drive, quicker than opening activity monitor and quitting it there.
