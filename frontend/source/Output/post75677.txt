Mac OS X 10.7.5 - always arrange folder items by date modified <body> How do I force Finder to always arrange all items in every folder by the date modified? I'm only asking because even after research, I couldn't resolve it -- going to "View" - "Show View Options" has the "Use as Defaults" greyed out for some reason, for all my folders. So I can't force it to sort by date by default. Any ideas?  <comment87847> Edit: How do I force "all" folders in my Mac to be sorted by these? Even those not seen before.
