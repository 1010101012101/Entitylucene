Filter out ARP query from given ether:ip <body> Let's say on my network there is a hacker who floods my computer with arp messages to associate his MAC address with the IP of the computer I want to reach.  It's like he sends the following message continuously (100 packets per second) to my computer:  precode192.168.1.2 (my target) has 0:0:0:0:0:1 (hacker's MAC address) /code/pre  the following does not work, I end up with the two association in codearp -a/code:  precodearp -a -d; arp -s 192.168.1.2 0:0:0:0:0:2 (the real MAC address of the target) /code/pre  Is it possible on macOS to  drop the arp packets from the hacker?  <answer296275> You could use a static ARP entry to solve the problem. This is done using "arp -s" as you write in your question. The second association is not a problem as the static entry will take precedence.  Alternatively you could block the MAC address of the spoofer. For example you could use the "ifconfig bridge" command to create a bridge over which you tunnel all packets from the evil MAC-address. When configuring the bridge, set that it tags the packets.  Then you can use the pf packet filter to examine all the tagged packets and possible reject them.  <comment374179> I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because it's not about Apple hardware, software, or services as defined in the [Help Center](http://apple.stackexchange.com/help) <comment374180> I think it is, since on linux I could use arptables, I want to know how I should do it with mac tools
