Terminal command to list application defaults? <body> I'm new to Mac from the Linux world, and I am looking for a command or file providing a list to default user applications associated with certain filetypes.  For example, on Linux:  precode$ cat /usr/share/applications/defaults.list /code/pre  provides the application names and priority hierarchies on Linux.  I've tried something similar using codedefaults/code on the Mac, but I can't seem to find what I'm looking for.  precode$ defaults read | grep pdf   name = "1309.0238.pdf";   name = "1309.0238.pdf"; /code/pre  Does the Mac operating system have a simple, command-line function or accessible file to find the default applications?  <answer276414> Not easily. You can use the well-hidden codelsregister/code command to dump the contents of the Launch Services database, which is what controls which file types open with which applications:  precode/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -dump /code/pre  but its output isn't well documented -- there's some info here, but it's over 10 years old so it's probably at least partially obsolete. A bit of Googling turns up some AppleScripts for further parsing, that you might be able to adopt:  ul lihttps://stackoverflow.com/a/3452435/476909/li lihttps://macosx.com/threads/howto-list-your-installed-applications.26204//li /ul  <comment347875> You can also use:  `/S*/L*/F*/C*/F*/L*/S*/lsregister -dump`
