Alternative ways to set a timer on macOS <body> I'm trying to set a timer on macOS (10.12 developer beta 1) to no avail.  Siri prompts me to set a reminder instead:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sbYet.png" alt="Siri response"  Most, if not all apps found on the Mac App Store don't provide this functionality without being too complicated:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wpcNy.png" alt="Mac App Store results"  Are there any other apps that can provide the functionality without being too complicated or hard to use?  <comment308021> I can see this being flagged as off-topic [developer beta]. To be on-topic you need to be on the public beta. <comment308082> [All betas are on topic](http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2707/what-happened-to-the-beta-ban). We just ask that you be clear of what build so feel free to vote to close if you can't tell what beta version as unclear, but voting to close just because beta isn't correct.
