Command to find out the version number of a .pkg file <body> Does anyone know how to retrieve the version number of a .pkg file which isn't installed yet?  I'd like to use something like strongpkgutil --pkg-info/strong, but that only works for installed packages.   I've also tried stronginstaller -pkginfo -verbose/strong, but that doesn't show the version number.  Is there a built-in command to do this, or alternatively, could someone suggest a one-liner please?  Thanks.  <answer180667> The best I could come up with was this:  precodepkgutil --expand package.pkg /tmp/pkg; cat /tmp/pkg/PackageInfo | grep ./Applications | grep -m 1 .app\" | awk '{ print $3, $2 }'; rm -rf /tmp/pkg /code/pre  Not the most elegant solution, so I'm still searching for a way to do this without having to extract the .pkg first.  <comment309482> Have you found any better solution yet ?? I do not see any effect to changing package version number when building the pkg file. The final package always seem to replace the existing files anyway, isnt it ?
