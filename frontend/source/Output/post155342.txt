How did the function "Save As…" change to "Duplicate"? <body> I recently noticed that within Pages ('09), Numbers ('09), Keynote ('09), the menu entry:  ul liFile  Save As…/li /ul  had been replaced by a new one:  ul liFile  Duplicate/li /ul  On the other hand I still use this function within some other applications like LibreOffice (4.2.3.3) without a problem. I suspect this change isn't a system wide one.  I didn't get any notice of this change of a key function in file management within any recent upgrade. hr When did this change appear?  Which upgrade performed this change?  <answer155344> This was changed in Lion along with the introduction of Auto Save and Versions. Save As is still available by holding kbd⌥ alt/kbd whilst in the menus.  <comment182928> Thank you for predicting and answering my next question :).
