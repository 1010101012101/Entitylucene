What is the max resolution output by the HDMI port of the MacBook Pro Early 2011 <body> The MacBook Pro (13-inch, Early 2011) has a Thunderbolt port of which I would like to know the maximum resolution. It does not say what it is on the specs site specifically. It merely says "supports full native resolution on the built-in display and up to 2560 by 1600 pixels on an external display, both at millions of colors", without specifying whether this holds true for all types of connections including HDMI. I have tested a miniDP to HDMI adapter that allegedly supports HDMI up to 4096x2160, but the max resolution i get is 2048x1152. I don't know if this is due to the Thunderbolt port or the adapter.  <answer293336> According to EveryMac.com, there were two 13-inch, Early 2011 MacBook Pro modelsâ€”the 2.3 GHz i5 and the 2.7 GHz i7. It actually doesn't matter which you have. They both have a Intel HD Graphics 3000, which does indeed support an 2560 by 1600 external display. It's your adapter.  <comment370083> What is the actual display capable of, what is it's max resolution? <comment370116> the cable is fine. I tried it with a different computer.
