"Enter/Return" with, or without "Fn" <body> Does Mac OS X, and any Mac application, handles kbdFn/kbd+kbdEnter/kbd differently from kbdEnter/kbd?br As optional question, does any application handles kbdFn/kbd+kbdReturn/kbd differently from kbdReturn/kbd?  <answer8737> I guess since kbdfn/kbd+kbdreturn/kbd equals kbdenter/kbd, the kbdfn/kbd+kbdenter/kbd-combination would equal kbdfn/kbd+kbdfn/kbd+kbdreturn/kbd which does not make much sense, so my vote is: no, there is no app that can receive this combo.   To prove, you'll need to read the key codes sent from keyboard to the system when it´s pressed (ie. Full Key Codes could do this for you)  - since I don´t have a keyboard with a physical kbdenter/kbd I unfortunately can´t do that.  <answer8757> This is not hard to find out.  Open vim and enter insert mode   ( Note: I just hit 'j' several times to move the cursor.  Why must I live like this?  Vim mode! Just did it again.)  Hit control-v  Hit your keystroke combo  Observe the char printed  repeat  check if printed char is different  if yes then they are different  if no , such as code&lt;Tab&gt; and &lt;Shift-Tab&gt;/code on the console, then they are not different.  EDIT:  Some background:       strongcodeCTRL-V/code/strong      Insert next non-digit literally. For special keys, the terminal code is inserted.  It's also possible to enter the decimal, octal or hexadecimal value of a character      codei_CTRL-V_digit/code.      The characters typed right after codeCTRL-V/code are not considered for mapping.      code{Vi: no decimal byte entry}/code      Note: When codeCTRL-V/code is mapped (e.g., to paste text) you can often use codeCTRL-Q/code instead       codei_CTRL-Q/code.   I tried this in my terminal.    kbdControl/kbdkbdV/kbdkbdEnter/kbd gave me code^M/code  kbdControl/kbdkbdV/kbdkbdFn/kbdkbdEnter/kbd gave me code^C/code  So vim sees the two as different. They send different codes.    <answer28882>    Does any application handle kbdFn/kbd+kbdReturn/kbd differently from kbdReturn/kbd?   Yes!  In iTunes 10.5, kbdReturn/kbd will make a highlighted song start playing but kbdFn/kbd+kbdReturn/kbd will allow you to rename the song.  This was revealed to me at How can I rename a song in iTunes with a keyboard shortcut?  <answer130201> kbdfn/kbd+kbdReturn/kbd is also recognized in Finder as the same way as iTunes.  in fact, this combination is like if you do one click on a selected item to rename it. in Windows world, it is like kbdF2/kbd key.  <comment9286> I apologize. I have the standard keyboard, which uses two different symbol for the Enter/Return key (one of those symbols is "⌅", the Unicode Projective character); it seems I said _Enter_ when I should have said _Return_. <comment9295> Well fn+enter will probably do nothing while fn+return==enter does make a difference. In iTunes, for example, pressing enter on a highlited song will let you change a its name, while return will start playing it. In fact, there are many other apps who recognize this difference, maybe we don´t need to list them all? ;-) <comment9300> Heh, "not hard." For the uninitiated, as I was until googling this through, I'll add some starting steps: Launch Terminal, type `vim` and *Return*, type `i`. Now you're in insert mode. After that, however, I have no idea. *Control-v* doesn't appear to do anything, and *Return* appears to enter a carriage return while *Enter* does nothing. <comment9303> Yikes.  You are correct.  Editing. <comment152498> In Finder, Enter, Return, fn + Enter, and fn + Return have all the same effect: rename the currently selected item.
