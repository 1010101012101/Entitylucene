Aperture won't import <body> Aperture 3.6 Yosemite 10.10.5 iPhone 10.3.2  Today my mac, running Aperture, will see my iPhone, but it will show "Loading assets" for a few seconds, then stop.  So far I've not found a clue.  A few messages about freezing  'loading assets' but none about it it seeing and essentially ignoring the phone.  It also did this when I attempted to slurp off a bunch of pix off a friends Canon Powershot SX 60.  Photos will import from that camera, but not aperture.  From my Nikon D7100, importing works fine.  This suggests that it's something to do with the phone.  Image Capture sees the images on my camera, but does not images on the iphone.  In Aperture, I realized that the File Type brick was set to Raw only.  Setting it to JPEG only results in the Loading Assets to circle indefinitely instead of the previous behavior of circling for a few seconds.  Photos sees my phone, and loads thumbnails.  I've done the Permissions, Repair, Rebuild.  Opening a new library still leaves the phone's photos invisible.  Suggestion?
