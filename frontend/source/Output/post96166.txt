Can't ssh into my Mac at home, from office <body> I'm trying to ssh/sftp to my Mac at home, from office.  I can ping it fine. I'm pretty sure I set up keys correctly with codessh-keygen/code  Here's what I'm getting (private info masked with code•••/code):  precodeEdit07:.ssh zeev$ ssh -vvv dzg@•••.dyndns.tv OpenSSH_5.6p1, OpenSSL 0.9.8r 8 Feb 2011 debug1: Reading configuration data /etc/ssh_config debug1: Applying options for * debug2: ssh_connect: needpriv 0 debug1: Connecting to •••.dyndns.tv [76.•••.62] port 22. debug1: Connection established. debug3: Not a RSA1 key file /Users/zeev/.ssh/id_rsa. debug2: key_type_from_name: unknown key type '-----BEGIN' debug3: key_read: missing keytype debug3: key_read: missing whitespace ...repeated... debug3: key_read: missing whitespace debug2: key_type_from_name: unknown key type '-----END' debug3: key_read: missing keytype debug1: identity file /Users/zeev/.ssh/id_rsa type 1 debug1: identity file /Users/zeev/.ssh/id_rsa-cert type -1 debug3: Not a RSA1 key file /Users/zeev/.ssh/id_dsa. debug2: key_type_from_name: unknown key type '-----BEGIN' debug3: key_read: missing keytype debug3: key_read: missing whitespace ...repeated... debug3: key_read: missing whitespace debug2: key_type_from_name: unknown key type '-----END' debug3: key_read: missing keytype debug1: identity file /Users/zeev/.ssh/id_dsa type 2 debug1: identity file /Users/zeev/.ssh/id_dsa-cert type -1 ssh_exchange_identification: Connection closed by remote host /code/pre  <answer96176> Your id_rsa file (containing your private key) is malformed.  Redo the keygeneration with "ssh-keygen -t rsa".  See https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys for full instructions.  You might want more bits than the default.  <comment112900> I did a `rm ~/.ssh/*` then `ssh-keygen -t rsa` and just hit enter for all questions. I still get the same errors. <comment135971> On which end?  You have two set of keys. <comment135972> This question is already asked on a partner site: http://superuser.com/questions/618613/cant-ssh-into-my-mac-at-home-from-office we'll let the answers there document whatever you ended up doing in this case.
