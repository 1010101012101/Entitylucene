xattr write delimiter <body> I am trying to write OM tags using xattr.   precodexattr -w com.apple.metadata:kMDItemOMUserTags tag1 a.rtf /code/pre  This works fine for one tag, but how do I add two or more? I have tried various combinations of quotes, commas, \, etc. without success so far.  Help greatly appreciated.  <answer280936> OM tags (com.apple.metadata:kMDItemOMUserTags) as well as user defined tags (com.apple.metadata:_kMDItemUserTags) are stored in an extended attribute and its value is a binary property list that contains a single array of strings.  Example with the tag emuser/em (xxd'd and converted to a xml with plutil):  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;array&gt;     &lt;string&gt;user&lt;/string&gt; &lt;/array&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  Simply using codexattr -w com.apple.metadata:kMDItemOMUserTags tag1 file/code won't create a properly defined OMUser or (Apple) User tag.  I recommend to use an "add tag" Python script like this one.  hr  emkMDItemOMUserTags/em seems to be outdated (or at least "difficult" to use) in macOS and are sometimes/often replaced with the em_kMDItemUserTags/em even in OpenMeta apps.
