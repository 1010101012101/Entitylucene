Yosemite keeps adding Spaces without apparent input <body> I am using a Mac Mini with Yosemite, and I noticed that the Spaces desktops keep increasing. I delete them to keep one desktop for each of the monitors I am using, and I end up with 26 of them on the main monitor.  What is causing this, and how can I fix it?  <comment220535> This was asked before, but got no meaningful replies - so, just as a ref - http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/157540/yosemite-auto-creates-multiple-desktops-spaces-on-main-monitor?rq=1 <comment220539> Ops, I will delete this, then. It's the same question as mine, even if it was asked earlier. Maybe, this question will put in evidence the other question. <comment220543> I'd leave yours in place, at least for now - just in case it attracts a good answer. If it does, the other could be marked as dupe of this. <comment231650> Same problem here. I think it happens when you go fullscreen with any app. Closing fullscreen mode doesn't remove the Space. <comment239904> @PietBinnenbocht I don't use applications in full screen mode; maybe I turned one to full screen a couple of applications, but the desktops keep increasing. <comment240741> Perhaps you full-screened a youtube or VLC video? That also seems to have the same effect.
