Printing problem only in web browsers <body> Under Yosemite 10.10.5 on an iMac, I get the following two error messages when printing from Firefox:  First error message:  "emPrint Preview Error.  An error occurred while printing/em"  Then, after clicking OK, I get the following second error message:  "emPrinter Error.   An error occurred while printing/em"  And, of course the web page doesn’t print anything.  The Preview app, in general, seems to be working fine.  And printing from other apps (not browsers) is also fine.  What I’ve tried:  ul liTried printing under Safari and Chrome.  Both yield one empty page./li liTried printing other apps.  All works fine./li liTried removing     com.apple.print.custompresets.forprinter.Canon_MX922.plist     No impact./li liRepaired permissions - no impact/li liRestarted in Safe mode.  Then restarted. No impact/li liOpened console and searched for "preview"   Got the following:br mdworker(456) deny file-read-data /Applications/Preview.app/li /ul  Any suggestions appreciated!  <comment274375> If you're able to, installing the latest version of OS X would be preferable. Since your problem isn't being solved even in safe mode, it's a printer problem. Check ink levels, then try restarting the printer. <comment274394> Thanks, angelplayer.  Restarting printer didn't help.  If "it's a printer problem." I can't explain why problem only appears for browser printing.  All other printing is fine. <comment274578> Update:  Reset the printing system using apple instructions at https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT201539     No impact on problem <comment274714> Update:  Tried Firefox in Safe Mode.   No impact on problem.
