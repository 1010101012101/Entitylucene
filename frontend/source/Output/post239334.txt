How to create Wi-Fi hotspot on OS X without having a connection? <body> I need to create a Wi-Fi hotspot on my OS X machine with no internet connection.br I need this in order to locally connect my Android smartphone via the hotspot and control the machine via an app (Unified Remote) for a presentation.br The place where I need this only has a corporate network which doesn't allow for such local connections.br I know this is going to work because I used to do this on Windows, but here the hotspot doesn't turn on until it has a wired connection, and automatically turns off if I unplug the ethernet wire.br Is there a way to turn on the hotspot even with no connections?  Thank you :)  <comment293688> Please consider rewriting.  I am unclear as to what you are asking. <comment293716> Yes, sorry, I hope it is clearer now :) <comment293717> Ok...but now it looks like a possible duplicate of [How to create an ad hoc Wi-Fi network in OS X?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/236623/how-to-create-an-ad-hoc-wi-fi-network-in-os-x)  did you look at this yet? <comment293718> The guy in the question wanted to share his internet connection through his mac... I just want the two devices to be on the same network so I can use the app mentioned above, I don't need internet. <comment293719> If you click the WiFi symbol in the top bar and select "create network" can your Android device connect to it? <comment293720> No, it's not visible even with the wire plugged. <comment293722> Turn your Android hotspot on and connect your Mac to it <comment293725> Already tried, it won't work even though I just tried the same thing using a Windows laptop and it works as it should :/  Connecting the OS X laptop to the Android hotspot gives errors in the app <comment293726> Since this is imminent I will have to find a Bluetooth radio dongle, but it would be great to discover a way to do this, it can be useful at times.  Thank you anyway :D <comment293789> Make a hotspot on your Android phone (settings - more - tethering - turn on Bluetooth tethering). Then turn on Bluetooth on your Mac. Then connect to your Mac via Bluetooth in Android phone's Bluetooth settings. Pair it up and turn off Wifi on your Mac and you should be connected like you want.
