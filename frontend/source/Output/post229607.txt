Can't find kernel.log file on Yosemite <body> I began kernel programming on mac.  Because I want to run my kernel extensions without code signing I had to do the following:  precodesudo nvram boot-args=kext-dev-mode=1 /code/pre  It works as it should be, but the problem is that I can't find my kernel.log file.  I opened Console app and even there under FILES there is no kernel.log, I have listed all the other files except that one.  Any suggestions where can I find my kernel.log file?  I need it for debug purposes.  <answer229620> On Yosemite, those kernel messages should be logged to codeSystem.log/code according to code/etc/asl.conf/code, which replaced the older codesyslog.conf/code. Apple System Logger and Syslog both use code/etc/asl.conf/code  precode # Rules for /var/log/system.log   &gt; system.log mode=0640 format=bsd rotate=seq compress file_max=5M all_max=50M  ? [= Sender kernel] file system.log /code/pre  Kernel.log is not used by any logger since 10.8 I believe, but confirmed in 10.10.x  Note, El Capitan and emSIP/em removed support for codekext-dev-mode/code, so keep that in mind if you need to debug in newer OS X versions.  <comment280132> Do you have any idea why simple `printf()` doesn't get logged? I load the example with `sudo kextload`, then check with `kextstat` if it was loaded and it is and then I unload the example with `sudo kextunload` and again check if everything is OK - and it is.
