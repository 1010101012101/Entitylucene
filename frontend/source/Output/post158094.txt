MacBook Wi-Fi can't connect on Connectify: invalid password <body> I made a hotspot using a Wi-Fi external receiver connected on my laptop running Windows with a program named Connectify just today.   My PC gets the Internet connection via the Ethernet connection and share it with Connectify. The name of my Wi-Fi network is "connectify".  I have noticed that only my iPad and iPhone are able to connect to it.   My MacBook just says "invalid password" when I know for a fact that the password I configured is correct.  I've never been able to connect to my Wi-Fi network from my Macbook. I have already deleted the Wi-Fi location configuration and made a new one without sucess.  What might explain this MacBook or Wi-Fi failure?  <answer158111> Lets try to reset your Macs settings.  precode            Go to System Preferences &gt; Network.             Click the Wi-Fi connection.             Click the Advanced... button on the bottom right.             Click the Wi-Fi tab.             Under Preferred Networks, select your wireless network.             Click the - (delete) button.             Turn off your Wi-Fi connection.             Turn it back on.             Select and login to your wireless network. This will re-save your connection under Preferred Networks.             Close your laptop and reopen it to test whether it worked. /code/pre  Next would be to try connecting manually using your Terminal (located in the Utility Folder.  Copy following in to your Termial:  To find the Network  precode/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/A/Resources/airport scan /code/pre  To Connect  precodenetworksetup -setairportnetwork en0 WIFI_SSID_I_WANT_TO_JOIN WIFI_PASSWORD /code/pre  Replace the SSID and Password with your data.  <answer278755> Before try association, can you please try if your device is able to scan your desired SSID properly (RSSI value not less than -60 dBm - -70 dBm).  ol liClick on your apple logo./li liSelect "About this Mac"/li liSelect System Report/li liGoto "Network" section and select "Wi-Fi"/li /ol  in this you will get all the network which your mac is able to scan. Look for your desired SSID and look for "Signal/Noise" field. Signal Strength value i.e. RSSI should not be low than -60 dBm for healthy connection.  Sometimes it is seen; when cable connected with Wi-Fi card is loosen it scans the Wi-Fi network at very low rssi, which in result affect the association.  <comment185903> What wifi receiver? <comment185909> It's just a usb that can send internet to my iphone/ipad and windows laptop. Not macbook. <comment185910> sorry, where is the USB connected to? <comment185914> To a desktop pc connected via lan. It's sending the lan connection via wifi. <comment185920> There are no preferred networks also terminal says to me "failed to join network" Error: -3924 invalid PMKlocalhost:~ home$" <comment185931> Does the first command list the network ? <comment185934> Yes it does show the connectify. <comment185945> Sorry, connectify is the SSID (network name) ? <comment185947> Yes connectify is the SSID. <comment260718> Does the hotspot have a maximum number of simultaneous client connections? Could the password error be a red herring because of bad error-handling from the receiver/misinterpretation from OS X?  Try to find out if there is a max connection limit to your hotspot. Also, try rebooting your Mac.  I have received invalid password errors from completely valid DD-WRT access points, and it was resolved by either rebooting my Mac or rebooting the router. Just reboot everything and see if it resolves itself. <comment301721> [This answer](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/42046/wifi-connection-has-password-issue-with-my-macbook-pro/244109#244109) helped me. <comment329998> Did you finaly understand and fix your network problem?
