Sharing a Dropbox link directly to the clipboard, without having a browser pop open? <body> Is there any solution for retrieving a Dropbox share link to a file, that doesn't involve opening a browser?  That puts it directly in the clipboard.  (For sake of clarity, I'm referring to when you right-click a file and select codeDropbox/code â†’ codeShare Link/code.)  <answer88473> No, you can't just get the link in clipboard, which is much safer for you. With Dropbox's version 2.0.5, you can easily share them through the toolbar.  There's a second way of doing it, being a lot better, which is:  Finder  Dropbox  public (move your public file here)  right click  dropbox  Copy public Link   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yTSLS.jpg" alt="dropbox share button"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QF4QF.jpg" alt="right click copy public link"  <answer92861> You can as of a couple of weeks ago.  <answer188781> Since September 2013 Dropbox introduced the possibility to automatically copy the public link of a shared screenshot to your clipboard.  On Mac you can use the default shortcuts kbdCmd/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbd4/kbd or kbdCmd/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbd3/kbd and the link is automaticlycopied to the clipboard.  On Windows you have to use kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdPrint Screen/kbd to get the link copied to the clipboard (If you just press kbdPrint Screen/kbd Dropbox will only add the Screenshot to the Screenshots folder).  <comment108934> Assuming the way you have in mind differs from the one in the other answer, can you please elaborate?
