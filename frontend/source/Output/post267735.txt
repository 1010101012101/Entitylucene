How can I get the Breitling Navitimer QP watch face on the Apple Watch? <body> I really like the set of information choices displayed on Breitling's Navitimer QP watch. Is there a custom watch face design service that I can pay for to have this particular watch face design incorporated into my Apple Watch or some derivative version thereof?  <comment336004> I think the only watch faces you can choose from are the built-in ones that Apple provides, apart from using your own pictures. The Navitimer QP would be a trademarked face so Breitling would have to agree to it and I don't think they have. <comment336005> "...derivative version..." Hack it?
