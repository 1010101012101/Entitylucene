How to enable multi-process in Firefox version 54 (64-bit)? <body> According to this MacRumors post, Firefox version 54 now uses multiple processes to browse the web, similar to Chrome. However, although I have upgraded to Firefox version 54 (64-bit), it still runs a single process. I have verified this in 3 different places:  ol liActivity Monitor has a single "Firefox" process, except for "Firefox Plugin Content (Shockwave Flash)"./li liI downloaded the Add-on Compatibility Reporter and it shows that multi-process id disabled./li liThe Enable Multi-process checkbox doesn't even show up in preferences./li /ol  I ditched Firefox last month to move onto Chrome due to sluggish performance even on blazing fast hardware, but prefer Firefox bookmarks due to the ability to tag them, a feature Chrome refuses to support for some reason. However I thought I'd give Firefox another try since they now support multi-process.  I have performed the "Refresh Firefox" option, but that did not enable multi-process.  Any ideas on how to get this working?
