Unable to delete locked file <body> I have a locked file on my machine that I'm unable to delete. I've tried everything (that I know of) and don't have a clue why it won't delete.  Here's what I tried:  ol liEverything here/li lisudo rm file.txt/li lichflags -R nouchg file.txt/li liunlocked the file in "get info"/li /ol  None of which worked.  Here is the typical result I get (admin is "me"):  precode$ sudo chflags -R nouchg file.txt $ sudo rm file.txt override rw-r--r--  me/staff sappnd,schg for file.txt? y rm: file.txt: Operation not permitted /code/pre  strongWTF/strong is going on here???  hr  UPDATE: tried this and still no joy:  precode$ sudo chflags noschg file.txt $ sudo rm file.txt override rw-r--r--  me/staff sappnd for file.txt? y rm: file.txt: Operation not permitted /code/pre  UPDATE2: turns out there was another flag also codesappnd/code:  precode$ sudo chflags sappnd file.txt $ sudo rm file.txt /code/pre  The flags on the file were the cause, so after removing them the file could be deleted. I'm not sure if there's a way to remove all the flags at once, but would have been easier.  <comment231109> Do you know what the file is? (As in, did you make it, or did something in the system put it there?) <comment231112> @user24601 It's empty - created using `touch file.txt` <comment231127> You asked "...remove all the flags at once..." and from OS X Man Pages for [CHFLAGS(1)](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/chflags.1.html) it shows the "SYNOPSIS" as, `chflags [-fhv] [-R [-H | -L | -P]] flags file ...` and further down the page is says "The flags are specified as an octal number or a comma separated list of keywords.".  So you could have used `ls -lO` to see what flags were set and if it was set as e.g., `uchg,sappnd,schg` then used the command as `sudo chflags nouchg,nosappnd,noschg file.txt` to unset all at one time.
