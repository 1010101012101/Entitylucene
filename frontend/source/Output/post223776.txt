charging my Macbook Pro (85w) with my Macbook Air (45w) charger <body> seeing if anyone as done this. Has any used a 45w charger (like the one that comes with the Air) to charge their Macbook Pro? I left my Pro charger at a friends house and will not be able to get it before I leave town for a work trip, where I'll need the Pro. I'm  thinking that I can shut down the laptop and use the Air charger to charge it over night.  Has anyone done this? I'm worried about damaging the battery on the Pro.  <answer223780> It will be fine. The MacBook Pro will charge with the Air's charger well; it will just be slower than if it was on its original charger. One can even charge a MacBook Air with the charger for the MacBook Pro, if one wanted to.  I have attempted this myself and have had no problems.  <answer223789> From Apple Support: Find the right power adapter and cord for your Mac notebook     Power adapters for Apple notebooks are available in 29W, 45W, 60W, and   85W varieties. You should use the appropriate wattage power adapter   for your Apple notebook. You can use a compatible higher wattage   adapter without issue, but it won't make your computer charge faster   or operate differently. strongLower wattage adapters will not provide   enough power./strong   Note: I added bold text to the last sentence.  <comment271291> The charger will report the max power it can output, and the MBP will not draw any more than 45W. Unfortunately, I can't find any references for that right now.
