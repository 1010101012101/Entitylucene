How can I get back the option to NOT require pairing in Lion? This is a change from Snow Leopard <body> I have Lion 10.7.1 -- I noticed that in System Preferences -- Sharing -- Bluetooth Sharing there is not longer the option to NOT require pairing. Why was this removed? How can I get that back, or does anyone know a programmatic way to disable the machine from requiring pairing? This is important to an app we have running, that allows anyone to bluetooth to the device without pairing. Thanks in advance.
