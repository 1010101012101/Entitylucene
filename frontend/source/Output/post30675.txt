Modify Global Mac OS X Path <body> What is the best way to permanently change the Mac OS X path variable?  I've tried to add a .profile file in my user home directory with the below path, but that didn't work. Right now I have to run the export command every time I open up a new instance of the console.  Any ideas?  export PATH=/Users/tom/sshfs-binaries:$PATH  <answer30676> If that's for a single user, you can add codeexport PATH=/new/path:${PATH}/code to code~/.bash_profile/code. If it's going to be really global (for all users), then add it to code/etc/profile/code and make sure the users have permission to access the path you're including. After that, you need to re-launch the shell, or reload the configurations with codesource /etc/profile/code or codesource ~/.bash_profile/code.  <answer30781> There's also ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist (also this and this).  "strongNote/strong: Any changes to ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist require that you logout and login again for the change to take effect."  <comment35252> how would I make it applicable for just one user? <comment35253> @C12: put that export command on the `/home/user/.bash_profile` file. <comment35347> I suspect this happened before the question was migrated, but `/home/user/.bash_profile` is incorrect. On OS X it's `/Users/username/.bash_profile` So for example: `/Users/c12/.bash_profile`, just create the file if it doesn't exist and changes will be automatically picked up at next login / terminal invocation. <comment35352> I'm not the admin of this machine and I don't have a user directory in the /home/ dir. I also don't have a .bash_profile file under /Users/username. Any ideas? <comment35357> Oh, my bad. Jason is correct. When I wrote that comment I forgot the question was about OS X.
