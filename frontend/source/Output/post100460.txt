How do I Create a Macro or Shortcut to run a Command Sequence Terminal <body> The following was posted by Codler as an answer to a question of read/write difficulties on NTFS drive which worked perfectly.  My question is, is there a way for a noob like me to create a shortcut method of running these steps in Terminal instead of typing it in each time I want to mount the drive?     ol   liPlug-in your device/li   liWrite in Terminal codediskutil list/code and look for IDENTIFIER where TYPE is Windows_NTFS.      In this case it is codedisk1s1/code/li   liThen run the following:  precodediskutil unmount /dev/disk1s1 cd /Volumes mkdir Elements sudo mount -w -t ntfs -o rw,nobrowse /dev/disk1s1 /Volumes/Elements open /Volumes/Elements /code/pre/li   /ol   <answer100502> You don't want the hard drive to show up in the Finder? I had a similar need in the past, and solved it by adding a line to code/etc/fstab/code:  precodeLABEL=&lt;disk label&gt; &lt;mount point&gt; ntfs auto,nobrowse /code/pre  where:  ul licode&lt;mount point&gt;/code is the directory where you want to mount the hard drive, in your case code/Volumes/Elements/code. I'd recommend, though, that you mount the drive elsewhere to prevent name collisions, as code/Volumes/code is used by the Finder to mount removable drives. Let's say you choose code/MyVolumes/code./li licode&lt;disk label&gt;/code is the hard drive name as it appears in the Finder, I guess codeElements/code./li /ul  So, in your case, the line should read:  precodeLABEL=Elements /MyVolumes/Elements ntfs auto,nobrowse /code/pre  Now, code/etc/fstab/code is a strongsystem file/strong so care must be taken not to break anything:  ol liOpen ApplicationsUtilitiesTerminal./li liIn Terminal, type:  precodesudo mkdir -p /MyVolumes/Elements /code/pre  to create the folder code/MyVolumes/Elements/code./li liNow type:  precodesudo cp -a /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.bak sudo cp /etc/fstab ~/Desktop/fstab.txt sudo chown $(whoami) ~/Desktop/fstab.txt /code/pre  Type your password when asked.  These commands: 1) create a copy of code/etc/fstab/code you can fallback to if anything goes wrong, 2) copy code/etc/fstab/code to your Desktop, 3) change ownership of the copy on your Desktop so that you can edit it./li liSwitch to the Finder, double click codefstab.txt/code on your Desktop and add at the bottom of the file (the file is probably empty) the following:  precodeLABEL=Elements /MyVolumes/Elements ntfs auto,nobrowse /code/pre  Press kbd⌘/kbdkbdS/kbd to save the file and kbd⌘/kbdkbdQ/kbd to close the editor./li liBack to Terminal, type:  precodesudo mv -f ~/Desktop/fstab.txt /etc/fstab /code/pre  to overwrite code/etc/fstab/code with your modified version./li liPlug in your drive. Does it work? strongGreat!/strong It doesn't? Something went wrong... type in Terminal:  precodesudo mv -f /etc/fstab.bak /etc/fstab /code/pre  to restore the original code/etc/fstab/code./li /ol
