iphoto to photos: where are files stored? <body> I migrated my iPhoto library to Photos 1.5.  Where are the original image files stored?  I've searched the file system for specific file names and don't find anything.  The menu item 'show referenced file in finder' is greyed out.    <answer242423> iPhoto and Photos both use libraries. These libraries, named by default 'iPhoto Library.photolibrary' and 'Photos Library.photoslibrary' (see pluralisation in package extension) are stored by default in ~/Photos (the Photos folder in your home folder).
