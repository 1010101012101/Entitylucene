So, if you change default App for this file, you'll get it while opening file from Terminal by click.   <comment164513> Why don't you add this as an answer below and (after the grace period) accept it? <comment164514> Users with less than 10 reputation can't answer their own question for 8 hours after asking. :( <comment164515> I've checked my suggestion and it worked: if you try to open a file in Finder, this file will be opened with default Application, assigned to its extension.
