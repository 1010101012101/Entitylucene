USB SuperDrive spontaneously ejects discs while reading <body> When I try to import or play a CD I loaded into my USB SuperDrive in iTunes, the SuperDrive ejects the CD halfway through a track.  It began some time ago, but it only happened rarely. This morning, though, I was only able to import one full track and then from a number of tracks only the beginnings (why that happened I don't know either). When a track is cut short iTunes just displays a green checkmark as if the importing had finished normally. What causes this and can I fix it? The SuperDrive is not very old (bought it last year) and has only been used with one computer: my early 2015 MacBook Pro (frequently updated).  <comment361561> Check iTunes prefs  General  Import Settings. Does Error correction on/off make any difference?
