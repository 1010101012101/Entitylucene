Does anyone know of an app or applescript to make it easier to simply save and email? <body> I find that several times a day I save a file then compose a new email, click the add attachment button, and try to find the file.  Does anyone know of an app or applescript to make it easier to simply save and email?  <answer64169> The app you want is called strongMail/strong. Seriously, what you need to do is save your file in whatever application you are using, then click the emproxy icon/em (the little document icon found in the title bar of the window next to the document name) and drag it onto the Dock icon for Mail. This will create a new mail message with the file you just saved as an attachment.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PSGd2.png" alt="enter image description here"  No script or other app needed; awesomely, it's a native feature of OS X.  <comment75374> Thanks Daniel.  This helps me for 80% of the time.  My only remaining pet peave is exports.  For example, I use pages to create a document but then export a word or pdf version from pages so the rest of the world can read it.
