How to install PhoneGap with Mac OS X Lion(10.7.3)? <body> I have a Mac OS X Lion(10.7.3). Now I want to install PhoneGap in my XCode. My XCode version is 4.3.2.  I followed the instruction of installation from PhoneGap web site at the time of installation. But when I create some one project it shows error as well as www folder also not created at the time of project creation.  According to the PhoneGap web site (http://phonegap.com/start) to install I have to have strongMac OS X Snow Leopard (10.6)/strong. Is it not possible to install PhoneGap with Lion(10.7.3) or I have to wait until the supported version comes up?  Note: I am new with Xcode, Mac and PhoneGape.  <comment187953> What error message are you seeing?
