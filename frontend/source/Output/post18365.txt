Is there a similarly fast alternative to Crtl + Shift + Eject for new Macbook that lack eject keys? <body> The new MacBook Air and Pro without optical drives lack an kbdEject/kbd key.  I use kbdCtrl/kbd + kbdShift/kbd + kbdEject/kbd a lot to put my display to sleep at the simple press of three keys. Without the kbdEject/kbd key being there anymore I'm wondering if there's an alternative to those very handy shortcuts which required the kbdEject/kbd key.  The alternatives I've found so far are not too good:  ul liin Alfred type "lock" - emtoo many strokes for fast computer locking/em/li lia hot corner in the bottom left to put the display to sleep - emok, but I get there by error too often and lock the computer for serious productivity bummers/em/li liclose the lid of the MacBook Air - emputs the Mac to sleep completely and therefore not very useful, when it should keep doing what it's doing./em/li /ul  Is there a similarly fast alternative to Crtl + Shift + Eject for new Macbook?  <answer18372> There's a writeup here about using Automator to assign the keyboard shortcut of your choice to lock the screen.  <answer59047> I'm using a MacBook Air 2012 with Mountain Lion, and the new keyboard shortcut is:  kbdControl/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbdPower/kbd  <answer59069> Are you just trying to put the display to sleep, or to lock it? If you're just putting the display to sleep, turning the brightness down all the way works as well.   strikeBTW Control+Shift+Power does emNOT/em work on my MacBook Pro 10,1 (Retina)./strike  <answer71502> The easiest way to lock your computer is to set require password immediately and turn off the display with the following key combination: kbdcontrol/kbd + kbdshift/kbd + kbdpower/kbd I find this super helpful and a great replacement for kbdctrl/kbd + kbdshift/kbd + kbddelete/kbd in Windows.  <answer71507> Another quick keyboard option is to use Alfred to perform basic system commands. However, I've chosen to customise my commands to put exclamation marks before codeshutdown/code, coderestart/code and codelogout/code to avoid the risk of accidentally activating them.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/go3Ot.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer82361> I just found that I could lock my screen using the following shortcut:  kbdControl ⌃/kbd+kbdShift ⇧/kbd+kbdPower ⌽/kbd  codeRequire password immediately after sleep or screen saver begins/code should be checked in the codeSecurity &amp; Privacy/code in codeSystem Preferences/code panel if you want to ensure a slept screen is also securely locked.  <answer82363> kbdcontrol ⌃/kbd+kbdshift ⇧/kbd+kbdeject ⏏/kbd or kbdcontrol ⌃/kbd+kbdshift ⇧/kbd+kbdpower ⌽/kbd should instantly put your display to sleep.

I installed [LockTight](http://www.gkoya.com/2006/11/23/locktight-for-mac-os-x-intel/), checked "Use all F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys" Preferences  Keyboard and set the shortcut for LockTight to crtl + shift + F12. <comment52729> Answers on Ask Different need to be more than just a link. It's okay to include a link, but please summarize or excerpt it in the answer. The idea is to make the answer stand alone. <comment52732> I did summarise it in my answer, my summary being  "use Automator to assign the keyboard shortcut of your choice to lock the screen." That's the answer; the rest is simply an instruction manual in how to use Automator, which does not belong on a Q&A site. <comment68045> It also works on my mid-2011 MacBook Air, and the power key can also be substituted for eject with other shortcuts. <comment68138> Are you running Mountain Lion? Your MBP has an eject key, no? <comment68146> The MBP10,1 is the Retina MBP with no eject button. Yes, I'm on ML. But I've rebooted my system since posting the answer, and it now works. ML bug, probably. <comment68199> This works on my mid 2010 MacBook Pro! +1 <comment95040> For completeness you should probably add to your answer that `Require password immediately after sleep or screen saver begins` should be checked in the Security & Privacy System preference pane. <comment130022> Just Power works for me on Mavericks on a Mid 2011 Macbook Air and a Late 2013 Macbook Pro. Saves two keystrokes! <comment130151> For me the power button itself sleeps the computer. <comment196430> Thank you!  No one else was talking about the FN button and I was going mad. <comment220331> What's the `power` key when using an external keyboard? <comment353303> This shortcuts are great! Where did you find them documented? Tnx.
