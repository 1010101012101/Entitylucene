How can I view (offline) the full English Wikipedia on OS X? <body> I want to download the complete English Wikipedia (not just the 45,000 article version floating around) for viewing offline  on my Mac.  I have downloaded Okawix, and downloaded a torrent with Wikipedia (en.wikipedia.okawix, available on the okawix site) to view within Okawix.  However, I can't figure out how to view this downloaded torrent within Okawix, so I'm not sure what I can do.  What is the best way to do this? Is there software to download and view Wikipedia?  <answer34084> It's not clear how you want to use the data once it's on your mac.  To narrow this down a bit, you can refer to the page that wikipedia has made to guide people like you that want to get a local copy of content and actually use it.  ul lihttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Database_download/li /ul  Pay particular attention to the sections:  ul liHelp importing dumps into MySQL/li liStatic HTML tree dumps/li liDynamic HTML generation from a local XML database dump/li /ul  The first option has you loading the dumps into your own database and is the most powerful, but means you will be running your own web server / database - your own little copy of wikipedia on your mac. The second two are guides to simply opening the dumped files in a web browser or other program that can render HTML and follow the links to files that rest on your mac's file system.  <comment38847> This has nothing to do with Apple. <comment38860> It might be, because an offline mac client, would do the job.. <comment38868> Are you looking for help using Okawix to actually read the dump it provides or would you be open to using the [wiki provided dumps of data](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Database_download) and setting up your own wiki to serve up the content using http? <comment38869> You would be better off buying the [Encylopedia Britannica](http://store.britannica.com/) it comes as several CD's and the advantage is that you can use it as a reference, as Wikipedia is not considered to be a reputable source of information, as it can be edited by anyone.
