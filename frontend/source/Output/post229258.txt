Why iMessage generate a lot of Encryption and Signing keys? <body> First of all I don`t use iMessage. I log out of iMessage on my iDevices.  Today I took a look of my login Keychain Access and there were 366 items. All of them were iMessage Encryption Key and iMessage Signing Key.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YwFSN.png" alt="iMessage Keys"  I delete it, reboot my Mac and open Keychain Access again. In the reboot 8 keys (see screenshot) were create. Is this behaviour normal?  <answer229697> That's not abnormal. The system makes these and there's not much detail Keychain Assistant will show so it's a bit difficult to know which is used where.  I wouldn't worry about it - they are so small, deleting them seems more risky than the benefit of clearing out "old" ones.  <answer259419> There is no problem in deleting those. Just close your messages app, remove all of those from keychain and reboot your mac. It will create a fresh pair for use.  PS: Log in and use it! It is one of the most secure IM services in the world, works seamlessly and allows you to send SMS from your mac.
