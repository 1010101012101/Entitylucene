How can I have Safari on OS X remember to permanently trust a website with my current location? <body> The only options on the location privacy prompt are 'Allow' or 'Don't Allow', with a 'Remember my decision for one day' modifier checkbox as well. But what if there's a site that I trust in perpetuity? I want to give it permission to access my location forever. Why can't I do that?  emSafari 8.0 on Mac OS X 10.10 Yosemite/em  <answer154972>    But what if there's a site that I trust in perpetuity?   If you want to trust a site in perpetuity check "Prompt for each website one time only" in SettingsPrivacy, visit the site, in the sheet that appears check the option "Remember my decision and don't ask me again" and click the kbdAllow/kbd button: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ILuaP.png" alt="enter image description here"  If you get prompted to allow Safari to use your location, press the kbdOK/kbd button: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/R2Chj.png" alt="enter image description here"  Note that the Cookies and Website DataDetails section in Safari: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Q1Ooe.png" alt="enter image description here"  doesn't mention whether a specific site can access your location information: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QMv19.png" alt="enter image description here" so you might lose track of which sites you allowed.

There must be a bug here because my 'ask only once' setting was checked, yet the dialog was prompting me with 'remember for one day.' I reset the setting and visited the website in question again and it was fixed.
