How do I get my AirPlay mirroring to take up my entire TV screen? <body> I have a 2011 27" iMac that currently has Mountain Lion installed on it, and I am trying to get the AirPlay mirroring to take up my entire 1080p widescreen TV.  How do I get that to happen?  <answer59493> Try setting the emMatch Desktop Size To/em setting in the AirPlay menubar item to strongApple TV/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lQjPa.png" alt="Airplay menu"  If that doesn't work, it may be that AirPlay is outputting at 720p and your TV isn't scaling - perhaps try a stretch or scale mode on your TV.  <answer150756> Click "Open Display Preferences" in the AirPlay menu (as shown above).  Set the resolution on your TV to 1080p.  The key, at least in my case, and I suspect in yours, is to click "overscan correction", which will get that last 1~5% black border to go away.   <comment68551> I already did that. I was trying to play a DVD from "DVD Player", and when I set the desktop size to AppleTV it only takes up about 1/3 of the screen starting in the upper left corner. And when I set the desktop size to the AppleTV when my iMac is not running the DVD Player, it will take up 2/3 of the screen starting at the top and centered.
