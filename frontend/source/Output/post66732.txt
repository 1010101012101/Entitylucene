How To Upgrade Snow Leopard to Lion (not Mountain Lion) <body> I couldn't find Mac OS X Lion in the App Store. Can I go from Snow Leopard to Lion without migrating to Mountain Lion?  Many programs are now dropping support for Snow Leopard (newer XCode, newer fortran compilers, etc.), but I don't want Mountain Lion. Mountain Lion still lacks support for some software that I like (ex. Little Snitch).  What are my (legal) options?  <answer66778> Call Apple, 1-800-My-Apple and order Lion over the phone.   This is the only way to get it now. Apple will email you a code you use on the App store to download it.  BTW - Little Snitch is Mountain Lion compatible now.  I highly recommend upgrading to Mountain Lion.  <answer66797> Or visit a nearby Apple Store after making an appointment for the Genius desk.  A friend of mine was offered to upgrade his machine - which is not able to run Mountain Lion - from 10.6 to 10.7 for free at the Genius desk in Amsterdam.  <comment78589> Have you previously purchased Lion from the MAS? <comment78601> I do a quick search with Google and find nothingâ€¦ But be carefull with upgrade to Lion, I try it and after 3 days, I downgrade to Snow Leopard ! <comment79113> @SamuelE.Giddins no
