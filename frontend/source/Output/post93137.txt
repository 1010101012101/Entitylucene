MacZfs with encryption on os-x <body> I have followed these steps for setting up zfs (maczfs 74.3.0, OSX 10.8.3) with encryption. Everything works fine, till I restart the computer.  After the restart, diskutil informs me that the file system is invalid and refuse to mount my ZFS pool disk:  precode **Mount failed**      The disk “Workspace” could not be mounted.   Try running First Aid on the  disk and then retry mounting. /code/pre  When I run the Verify Disc, I get an error:   precode... The volume &lt;UUID OF MY ZFS LOGICAL VOLUME&gt; appears to be OK. Checking file systemChecking Journaled HFS Plus volume. Invalid B-tree node size The volume   could not be verified completely. Error: This disk needs to be repaired. Click Repair Disk. /code/pre  The cause of the error is that the Logical Volume is ZFS.   How can I mount my ZFS partition? I wonder whether it is not an issue with maczfs or the way I created my pool (emzpool create /dev/disk2/em).
