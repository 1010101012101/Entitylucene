MacBook Pro Retina lag when switching workspaces <body> I got a lag when I switch between workspaces (four fingers left/right).  Can somebody confirm this?  I assume this is the weak ivy bridge graphics. If this is true only the next generation will fix this....  Regards  <answer60837> Try disabling automatic graphics switching (http://serato.com/video-sl/support/5613/how-to-adjust-graphics-performance-for-the-macbook-pro) and see if that helps. It may be trying to use the slower integrated graphics over the dedicated GPU.  Also, you may experience lag when using a scaled resolution. This is most likely a hardware issue but future software revisions may help.  <comment70091> Hi, I use the best for retina resolution. But thank you for the link. Now I now how I can get ride of it when it is getting to annoying :)
