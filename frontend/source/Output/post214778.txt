Monitoring Wifi Usage per SSID (wifi) <body> I use my iPhone to connect to multiple wifi (SSID) in multiple location each day (Home, University, ...) and I need to monitor and track my wifi usage per SSID. For example I want to know how much download I did in my Home.  I know there exist some app which show wifi usage geographically in map. But it doesn't satisfy my need because In my home I have two separate internet connection which can be accessed through two different access-point (SSID) and I need to know how much was my usage per these two wifi.  strongAny Suggestion guys?/strong    <comment373678> Software recommendations are off-topic on Ask Different, but this has the potential to be a good question on our sister site [Software Recommendations](https://softwarerecs.stackexchange.com).
