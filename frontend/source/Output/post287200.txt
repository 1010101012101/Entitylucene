How do I install mayAVI for my python3 on macOS Sierra? <body> I have been using matplotlib to plot 3D graphs, however I have found that matplotlib does not have a drag and rotate function for the plotted 3D graphs. I would like to install mayAVI that will enable me to do so, however I can't find any foolproof methods to install it. Could anyone guide me in the installation process? I do not use virtual environments.  <answer287218> Do you have codeHomebrew/code? If not, here is how you install it. It might take a few minutes. Just copy and paste this:  precode/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" /code/pre  afterward, you need to first install VTK Python via:  precodebrew install vtk /code/pre  and then to install mayAVI itself:  precodepip install mayavi /code/pre  Pip is the python package manager that comes automatically with python, and seeing as you have a Mac, you already have it installed on your system. If for whatever reason you don't, you can follow the instructions here if necessary to download it  <answer293444> I recently experienced your exact same problem (wanting to use MayaVi instead of matplotlib for 3D graphs and animations, not wanting to use virtual environments, and wanting to use MayaVi with python3). These are the direct steps I followed to start using MayaVi on my macOS Sierra 10.12.5.  strong(1) brew install vtk --with-python3 --without-python/strong  ul liThis took roughly 33 minutes on my machine/li liFrom what I have read, there can only be one version/wrapper of vtk installed at a time, so since you installed vtk without the flags, you might want to run strongbrew uninstall vtk/strong before running this command/li /ul  strong(2) pip3 install mayavi/strong  Next I tried running the script from http://docs.enthought.com/mayavi/mayavi/auto/example_mlab_visual.html#example-mlab-visual to see if it would run. I took that script exactly as found, added strong#!/usr/bin/env python3/strong and ran it as strong./test.py/strong. This resulted in:  ======  Traceback (most recent call last):   File "./test.py", line 6, in      f = mlab.figure(size=(500,500))   File "/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/mayavi/tools/figure.py", line 63, in figure     engine = get_engine()   File "/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/mayavi/tools/engine_manager.py", line 101, in get_engine     return self.new_engine()   File "/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/mayavi/tools/engine_manager.py", line 146, in new_engine     check_backend()   File "/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/mayavi/tools/engine_manager.py", line 49, in check_backend     ''') ImportError: Could not import backend for traits  hr  Make sure that you have either the TraitsBackendWx or the TraitsBackendQt projects installed. If you installed Mayavi with easy_install, try easy_install . easy_install Mayavi[app] will also work.  If you performed a source checkout, be sure to run 'python setup.py install' in Traits, TraitsGUI, and the Traits backend of your choice.  Also make sure that either wxPython or PyQT is installed. wxPython: http: //www.wxpython.org/ PyQT: http: //www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/intro`  =====  So after googling the above problem I came across a github issue page that said to install the following items:  strong(3) brew install wxpython/strong  strong(4) pip3 install traitsui/strong (this was already installed on my machine)  Next, needing to install PyQt, so I followed the directions from a stack overflow question:  strong(5) brew tap cartr/qt4/strong  strong(6) brew tap-pin cartr/qt4/strong  strong(7) brew install qt/strong  strong(8) brew install pyside/strong  ul liThis took about 11 minutes on my machine/li /ul  Now I tried running the script again. This time it ran, but I got the error:  precodeAttributeError: module 'tvtk.tools.visual' has no attribute 'color' /code/pre  So I changed the import line and modified some of the lines where the boxes are made:  precode#!/usr/bin/env python3                                                                                 from mayavi import mlab from tvtk.tools import visual from vtk.util import colors as color  # Create a figure                                                                                     f = mlab.figure(size=(500,500)) # Tell visual to use this as the viewer.                                          visual.set_viewer(f)  # A silly visualization.                                                                              mlab.test_plot3d()  # Even sillier animation.                                                                             b1 = visual.box() b2 = visual.box(x=4., color=color.red) b3 = visual.box(x=-4, color=color.red) b1.v = 5.0  @mlab.show @mlab.animate(delay=250) def anim():     """Animate the b1 box."""     while 1:         b1.x = b1.x + b1.v*0.1         if b1.x &gt; 2.5 or b1.x &lt; -2.5:             b1.v = -b1.v         yield  # Run the animation.                                                                                  anim() /code/pre  And I can successfully run the script!  <comment362577> Hi, thank you for the instructions, I followed it and successfully installed vtk, however i have the following error when installing mayavi via:  pip3 install mayavi  Command "/usr/local/opt/python3/bin/python3.6 -u -c "import setuptools, tokenize;__file__='/private/var/folders/2d/qk9x42ws7s9dqr3n6cm2jrhr0000gn/T/pip-build-eefc74h7/mayavi/setup.py';f=getattr(tokenize, 'open', open)(__file__);code=f.read().replace('\r\n', '\n');f.close();exec(compile(code, __file__, 'exec'))" install --record <comment362578> /var/folders/2d/qk9x42ws7s9dqr3n6cm2jrhr0000gn/T/pip-bbm_eqpb-record/install-record.txt --single-version-externally-managed --compile" failed with error code 1 in /private/var/folders/2d/qk9x42ws7s9dqr3n6cm2jrhr0000gn/T/pip-build-eefc74h7/mayavi/ <comment362773> @Tian I'm not sure, you'll have to google the error code to get more specifics. <comment362891> @ Gleland, sorry I realise I was not specific enough, I used the command: pip3 install mayavi because i wanted to install mayavi on my python3 instead, however i got the error message: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'vtk' followed by that block of code i commented earlier. Does this help? <comment362980> @Tian Have you looked at [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41758688/how-to-install-and-run-mayavi-by-pip3-with-vtk) post about it?
