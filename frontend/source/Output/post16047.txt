Recommended way to back up a Macbook before upgrading its OS? <body> I'm planning on upgrading a friend's Macbook from OS X Leopard to OS X Snow Leopard. I think it's a good idea to backup all the data before upgrading the OS, in case something goes wrong. The problem is that the important data is not clearly stored in a single location&nbsp;â€” e.g. it may be scattered all throughout the system since my friend doesn't store all his data in one location, so it's very difficult to know which files/folders I should or shouldn't back up.  Is there any recommended procedure I should follow or a built-in (preferred) or 3rd-party tool I should use to back up the data before an OS upgrade?  <answer16054> Hard to answer, not because technical difficulty - but psychology. ;) So I will take take the answer a bit easy...  strongA. The simple way/strong  Make an TimeMachine backup. (if you do 1st times will get a full backup) so you will able restore anything what you created on the Mac. For this you will need:  ul lione external HDD (big enough), connect it/li ligo to system prefs/li liuse this extrnal HDD as Backup disk for the TimeMachine/li /ul  strongB. As A. but with an boot-able time machine HDD/strong  For this you will need:  ul lione external HDD (big enough)/li liyour OS X install DVD/li liturn off time machine, if you have it on/li liconnect HDD/li liinsert install DVD/li listart /Applications/Utilities/DiskUtility.app/li liselect your external HDD/li ligo to "Restore" Tab/li liinto "Source field" drag your Install DVD/li liinto "Deststination" drag your external HDD/li litriple check (so DON'T ERASE YOUR INTERNAL HDD!)/li lipress Restore and going to take a lunch/li liafter the restore, exit Disk Utility/li lieject Install DVD/li ligo to System Prefs and enable Time machine/li liselect your external HDD as BackupDrive/li liMake a full Time Machine backup/li /ul  With the above you get a BOOTABLE TimeMachine HDD, you when things going wrong you can hold down Alt whe you MAc booting a can select this HDD for BOOT and restore from it without needing the install dvd (faster restore).  strongC. Want even more?/strong  Make working copy of your HDD. It is like above, will got an BOOTABLE external HDD, but not for install purpose, but for emworking from it/em. So, you can boot it and continue work as from your internal HDD.  For this you can:  ul liget a donation-ware: CarbonCopyCloner, or/li limake a normal install into external HDD, boot it, and use the MigrationAssistant.app to migrate data from the internal HDD to freshly installed external HDD/li /ul  strongDo you know than paranoia is the right state of the system administrator's mind?/strong  Do B and C - So you will need two external HDD's. Is is the best, because you can drop your backup HDD from table, and after this crash-test the drive will be probably unusable (broken). :) Anyway, for this solution you need do not crash-test both drives.  With this, you will can WORK immediately (from the external drive) and restore from the TimeMachine (from the second ext.HDD).  strongKnow Murphy?/strong  ul liAnything that can go wrong, will go wrong. (Hang up Murphy!)/li liYour upgrade will fail (but usually it doesn't)/li liYour backup will fail too (but usually you don't need it)/li liso... take it easy ;)/li /ul  strongPs:/strong  Here is more ways, e.g.: over the network from the command line with codersync/code command, etc. etc...  strongYOU REALLY WANT READ/strong  ul liThis, especially/li lihttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT1553/li lihttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT1427/li lihttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT1177/li /ul  <comment17530> If it is a one time thing, I would go with a bootable backup using SuperDuper! or CarbonCopyCloner. If it is an ongoing backup policy, Time Machine rules, but a bootable backup is handy. Either way, backup and restore will take several hours. <comment17539> +1 - Another [CCC](http://www.bombich.com/) fan here. Once you start using it it's hard to imagine how you got by without it.
