Is there a bluetooth phone that can remain paired with iPhone? <body> What I would like to do is find a bluetooth capable phone that I can pair with my iPhone and will remain paired even if my iPhone is paired with a bluetooth headset at the same time.  I had purchased the AT&amp;T phone model TL92278, but, if I forgot to turn off my headset just before I returned home, the phone would no longer be paired with my iPhone. It was easy, but annoying to have to pair it again constantly.  Basically, I am wondering if there is a phone out there that can remain paired with my iPhone while my iPhone is paired with a headset.  <answer33484> I have had good experience with Uniden. They make a range of phones that pair to your iPhone via bluetooth. They are good for incoming but have not yet worked out how to make outgoing calls through them.   <comment9027> paired and doing what? <comment9029> Waiting for a phone call. <comment23139> I still dont understand what a phone paired to an iPhone does for you. <comment24147> I can have multiple handsets spread throughout my home and when someone calls me on my iPhone, those handsets will ring. I do not need to carry my iPhone with me all of the time while at home. <comment38692> And, if you arrive at home with your phone paired with a bluetooth headset, does your Uniden phone remain paired with your iPhone?
