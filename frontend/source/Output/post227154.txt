Is possible to create bootable encrypted partitions of Win10 + Debian + DATA on external SSD? <body> I'm dealing with pretty tricky problem. I want to have strongexternal/strong disk completely separated from OS X running on internal SSD. On external SSD should be three partitions:  ol liWindows 10 - is possible to use Bootcamp (because of drivers) - strongbootable/strong/li liDebian - is possible to encrypt this partition? - strongbootable/strong/li liData - I need to have this partition accessible from strongevery/strong OS./li /ol  Is this possible?  Thanks!
