How can I find the serial number on a mac programmatically from the terminal? <body> What command can I use to retrieve the system's serial number from the unix command line? As codeuname/code will output some information about the software and hardware, I would like to retrieve the serial number from a command to use in a script.  <answer40244> The system_profiler command is perhaps the best tool for the job (assuming you are on 10.3 or newer), but you can also use ioreg for the task.  codesystem_profiler SPHardwareDataType/code is the data type that contains the core hardware information, and you can use grep or awk to pare things down further as needed:  precodesystem_profiler SPHardwareDataType | awk '/Serial/ {print $4}' /code/pre  or  precodeioreg -l | awk '/IOPlatformSerialNumber/ { print $4;}' /code/pre  Both of those commands take between 0.5 and 0.2 seconds to run on modern SSD Macs, so if you want to optimize the command and remove the " you can have your answer in 0.005s or so:  precodeioreg -c IOPlatformExpertDevice -d 2 | awk -F\" '/IOPlatformSerialNumber/{print $(NF-1)}' /code/pre  <answer120926> This also worksâ€¦  precodeioreg -l | grep IOPlatformSerialNumber /code/pre  <answer293743> To make it easier to remember, use a case insensitive search:   precodeioreg -l | grep -i serialnumber | grep -i platform /code/pre  <comment140965> It's certainly easier to type than the `awk` version to strip out the the 600 lines of `ioreg` output we don't want to see. (also - don't mind the down voters - some people really don't like short answers or forget that not everyone knows how grep and awk work.) <comment140966> Ok, thanks bmike, it seems simpler to me, but didn't expect down votes for a correct answer. Good to know. <comment140967> @MrPool when it does repeat what is in an earlier answer and does not improve on the previous one <comment140968> They are not wrong votes per se. Even down votes are good as they indicate someone cares enough to take action. Also, I try to comment or post to chat when I see votes that don't strike me as totally fair in sum. The good news is up votes are +10 and down votes only -2 so if you post something controversial (like this zero balance with +2 and -2 is still +16 rep.) welcome to the internet ;-) <comment140969> And mark is correct, if all a user does is post exclusively late, short, minor changes without explaining (if I guessed your point - typing grep is both more clear, shorter, and good enough for many) I might ping that user and ask they knock it off. Most high reputation users would comment on my answer, but we can't expect a new user with 1 rep to do that, now can we :-) <comment140982> I appreciate the insights, I don't often take the time to post to forums but have often received some good info here and figured I'd join in. Next time I'll add in my 2 cents about why my reply is both different and possibly better than a previous answer. Thanks for taking the time... cheers. <comment203834> The `ioreg` one is near instant on my MBPR. `system_profiler` although faster on this mac than my older ones is much slower.
