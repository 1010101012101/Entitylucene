I get a bash syntax error message every time I open Terminal on macbook <body> precode-bash: /Users/admin/.bash_sessions/720116FC-4C25-4FFA-AC15-00D5C843C15F.session: line 1: syntax error near unexpected token (' -bash: /Users/admin/.bash_sessions/720116FC-4C25-4FFA-AC15-00D5C843C15F.session: line 1: echo Restored session:  /code/pre  Does anyone know how to fix this?  <answer238364> Looks like one of bash's session files got corrupted.   precoderm  /Users/admin/.bash_sessions/* /code/pre  should fix this.   <answer243856> This problem is caused by OS X bash session restoration process which inserts in every '.session' file command like this:  precodeecho Restored session: суббота, 25 июня 2016 г. 23:29:08 (MSK) /code/pre  We should not use symbols like '(' in echo command text without being wrapped in quotation marks, but OS X forgot about it, alas. The only way for me to get rid of this naughty error message is to disable bash sessions at all:  precodetouch ~/.bash_sessions_disable /code/pre  And it works.  <answer251209> Open /etc/bashrc_Apple_Terminal (requires sudo), replace  precodeecho echo Restored session: $(date) &gt;| "$SHELL_SESSION_FILE" /code/pre  with  precodeecho echo \"Restored session: $(date)\" &gt;| "$SHELL_SESSION_FILE" /code/pre  The point is to quote the echoed message.  <comment292319> What command are you trying to execute? <comment292323> His question title is 'I get a bash syntax error message *every time I open Terminal on macbook*'. I don't think he has any starting commands.
