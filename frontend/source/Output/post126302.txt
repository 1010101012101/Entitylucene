How to login as a different bash user in terminal? <body> I have to check if my web page running locally on nginx does not work due to permission issue. My web scripts are running as code_www/code user, so I tried to switch to code_www/code but this does not work:  precodemaciek@macus:~$ sudo su - _www Password: maciek@macus:~$ whoami maciek /code/pre  How can I do this in 10.8.5?  <answer126303> Use codelogin/code:  precode$ login login: username Password: Last login: Day Month Date HH:MM:SS on ttys000 $ whoami username /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/M8h2j.png" alt=""  <answer126306> The codesudo/code is failing because the code_www/code user has code/usr/bin/false/code as its shell, causing the session to end as soon as you've switched user.  The solution is to use the code-s/code option, which will execute your current shell instead of code_www/code's shell:  precode$ sudo -s -u _www Password: $ whoami _www /code/pre  Just tested on a 10.9 system but it should work fine on 10.8.  <comment147905> I don't think that system users have passwords. It prompts for password, and empty does not work. <comment269271> this is the correct way to do it. <comment269272> normal users should not use `sudo`. <comment269295> As the OP commented, this won't work for users that don't have passwords (which the `_www` user won't have by default, nor should it have one).
