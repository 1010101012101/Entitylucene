resetting git path after clean install <body> I just reinstalled mountain lion and seem to have lost git in the process. I tried following this post : Why is Git not found after installing OS X Lion? but although I can cd into code/usr/local/git/code I get code/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin/codewhen I codeecho $PATH/code  How can I change the path so I can go back to using git? Sorry if this is an obvious question, I'm fairly new to git/terminal commands.   strongUpdate:/strong  I tried as suggested in another post and it seems to be working again:  precodesudo -s mkdir -p /usr/local/bin ln -s /usr/local/git/bin/git /usr/local/bin/git exit /code/pre  <answer97273> Touch your .bash_profile to create it if you have none:  precodetouch ~/.bash_profile /code/pre  Now, add this line to the above file at the end of the file:  precodeexport PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/git/bin /code/pre  Then, run this in the terminal  precodesource ~/.bash_profile /code/pre  <answer97277> You can add it to your .bash_profile as another answer suggests, but the install should create a file in /etc/paths.d to add it to users' paths:  precode$ ls -l /etc/paths.d/git -rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel  19 Sep 17  2009 /etc/paths.d/git $ cat /etc/paths.d/git /usr/local/git/bin /code/pre  If you don't have that, you can do this:  precodesudo bash -c '( echo /usr/local/git/bin &gt; /etc/paths.d/git )' /code/pre  Personally I don't like path entries for every little package, so I would symlink the contents of /usr/local/git/bin into another bin dir.  <comment114098> See anlr's answer there <comment114100> I looked at that but was a bit hesitant as I have Mountain Lion and not Lion. <comment114103> Oh nevermind I got it confused with another answer I found that specifically mentions Lion. It works fine. I guess I should erase this question as it was already answered? <comment114106> in this case leave it as it will be closed as a duplicate but will help others searching e.g. if they search for mountain lion. <comment114158> Thanks for your answer. I've already got it working though. I was trying to run the above commands anyway but am wary of breaking something that currently works ;) So if I understand correctly this would change the path per package? <comment114199> It would add "/usr/local/git/bin" to the system default path. At login, it includes any paths defined in text files within /etc/paths.d/ directory. So what software installers are supposed to do, instead of modifying user's .bashrc files, is to create a text file in that directory with the bin directory to be added to the path. If you look, you probably have others you can use as an example. I have 5 or so, some starting with numbers (to make them appear sooner in the PATH) and some do not. And you don't have to use echo as I show. You can just sudo to root and use a text editor to create it. <comment114909> I seem to have made a right mess of things and somehow my bash_profile settings are no longer recognised. I am getting `unknown-00-26-bb-0e-a8-1f:~ mantismamita$` as my prompt instead of the usual. (mantismamita is my username)
