How to get ongoing notifications of unread texts? <body> One of my family members texts me at night when they are having nightmares. I want to know when they text me at 4 am instead of sleeping through it.  Is there a way to make text notifications keep going off until read?  <answer221588> The closest you’re going to get is to set Messages alerts to repeat 10 times by going into Settings → Notifications → Messages. There, swipe to the bottom to reveal the codeRepeat Alerts/code menu:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/istAn.png" alt="Repeat Messages Alerts"  This will cause Messages notifications to ring for 20 minutes after the initial one, or until you’ve read/dismissed them.  Next, make sure codeDo Not Disturb/code is disabled by going into Settings → Do Not Disturb and toggling both codeManual/code and codeScheduled/code to codeOff/code (there are no VIP notifications in Messages yet).  You could also assign a custom loud and obnoxious text tone to the family member in question that will make it more likely a message from them will wake you up, but that alert sound will trigger for all text messages they send you, even during the daytime.  Coworkers who were on-call 24/7 also found it useful to turn on codeLED Flash for Alerts/code under the codeHEARING/code section of Settings → General → Accessibility.  If you lay your iPhone face down at night it will flash brightly when you receive a notification, although this will be active at all times for emall/em notifications, so you might need to disable this every morning and re-enable it at night.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SQs7q.png" alt="LED Flash for Alerts"  A note on Do Not Disturb: if you have a habit of using Do Not Disturb and occasionally forget to turn it back off, you can make sure it gets disabled at night by emenabling/em codeScheduled/code for a 1-minute duration every evening, say, from 10:30 to 10:31 p.m., or sometime before you go to bed.
