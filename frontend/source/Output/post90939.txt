Older time machine backups not showing after renaming the backup HDD <body> I have a HDD for time machine archives. In Finder I renamed it, then made it start a new backup. Now none of the older backups show when I enter in Time Machine mode. I get why this is happening but I can't see how I can make it show the older back ups now.  These older ones show in Finder inside that HDD, but not in Time Machine mode, to sum it up. Does anybody know what to do?
