OS X Migration Assistant can't see Time Machine drive <body> I've wiped my machine (to start over), and I'd like to restore some key files back (like pictures and stuff like that).  However, when I connect my Time Machine drive and open Migration Assistant, it can't find my Time Machine drive. I've even tried logging in as root and invoking the application; no dice. It can see one of my emold/em machine's backup (pre-2009), but that's not really the one I want.  It might be a problem that the name of my machine somehow was changed to 'iMac 1 (2)' - and thus the folder in Backups.backupdb is named the same - could that be tripping up Migration Assistant?  <comment131757> Are you comfortable in terminal? When you mount the drive in finder, can you navigate to a recent backup time stamp folder? <comment131758> Yep - everything's there, it's just a problem of getting Migration Assistant to see the drive. <comment131759> So - what does `ls -la` show for the machine directories and next level?
