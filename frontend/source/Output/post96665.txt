Is it possible to create a user without a home directory? <body> I want to create a user to run tomcat on my system and was wondering if it is possible to create a user without a home directory like it is possible in linux.  <answer96666> Yes you can, using the following code.  Note that the UniqueID, if less than 501, may not list the user in the Accounts pane of system preferences, depending upon the OS version.  Be careful that it is not already assigned to another user account.  precodesudo dscl . -create /Users/ThisUserName sudo dscl . -create /Users/ThisUserName UserShell /bin/bash sudo dscl . -create /Users/ThisUserName UniqueID 505 sudo dscl . -create /Users/ThisUserName PrimaryGroupID 20 sudo dscl . -passwd /Users/ThisUserName Pa55w0rd /code/pre  You can assign a home folder outside of the normal /Users/ hierarchy with:  precodesudo dscl . -create /Users/ThisUserName NFSHomeDirectory /path/to/your/home /code/pre  If you want a clearer name to show up in the accounts preference:  precodesudo dscl . -create /Users/ThisUserName RealName "This User Name" /code/pre  If you su to the new user without having set a NFSHomeDirectory, the $HOME defaults to code/var/empty/code.  <comment113496> If you want to create an account to run `tomcat`, I'd suggest not to give it a password, a shell of `/usr/bin/false`, to give it an ID = 80 (below 500), and a name of `_tomcat` (to follow the rules on MacOS X). <comment113740> @danielAzuelos using /bin/false as the home directory prevents me from su-ing to the user. <comment113777> â†’ Dark: I suggested do give it a shell of `/usr/bin/false` not a home. This is the standard way all `_users` are configured on MacOS X. This doesn't prohibit any access through `sudo`. Check with: `dscl` & `sudo` on `_sandbox`.
