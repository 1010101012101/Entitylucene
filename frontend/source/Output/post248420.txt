How to boot OS X without Recovery partition (triple boot)? <body> I installed 3 operating systems onto my MacBook Pro: OS X, Arch Linux and Windows 10.br Since it's a "triple boot" system, I didn't use emBoot Camp Assistant/em to install Windows. I installed Linux and Windows by bootable USB sticks.br Note that after installation, there are 3 EFI programs in the EFI partition. (This message may help)  The computer boots Linux with emGRUB/em by default. When I need OS X or Windows, I press the kbdopt/alt/kbd key and choose one of the two visible volumes to boot to OS X or Windows (strange, there is no GRUB, I have not find an answer yet).  hr  Recently I needed to increase OS X partition's space, so I used codegparted/code to move space from Linux to OS X.  But I deleted the Recovery HD partition by mistake, when I set the partition sectors. Now, I c between number 2 and 3.  I found somean't boot OS X by pressing the kbdopt/alt/kbd key â€“ there's no OS X disk (or OS X EFI program).  Now the partition table of my disk output from codegparted/code:  precodeModel: ATA APPLE SSD SM0128 (scsi) Disk /dev/sda: 121GB Sector size (logical/physical): 512B/4096B Partition Table: gpt Disk Flags:   Number  Start   End     Size    File system  Name                          Flags  1      20.5kB  210MB   210MB   fat32        EFI System Partition          boot, esp  2      210MB   39.3GB  39.1GB  hfs+  3      39.3GB  78.4GB  39.1GB  ext4  4      78.4GB  78.4GB  16.8MB               Microsoft reserved partition  msftres  5      78.4GB  121GB   42.9GB  ntfs         Basic data partition          msftdata /code/pre  output about codegptfdisk/code:  precodeDisk /dev/sda: 236978176 sectors, 113.0 GiB Logical sector size: 512 bytes Disk identifier (GUID): B133416F-2521-4304-9D89-0DF9C1184A21 Partition table holds up to 128 entries First usable sector is 34, last usable sector is 236978142 Partitions will be aligned on 8-sector boundaries Total free space is 2021 sectors (1010.5 KiB)  Number  Start (sector)    End (sector)  Size       Code  Name    1              40          409639   200.0 MiB   EF00  EFI System Partition    2          409640        76685311   36.4 GiB    AF05      3        76685312       153092095   36.4 GiB    8300      4       153092096       153124863   16.0 MiB    0C01  Microsoft reserved ...    5       153124864       236976127   40.0 GiB    0700  Basic data partition /code/pre  The recovery partition should be exist between number 2 and 3.  I found some related articles - all of them say it's safe to delete the recovery partition until you really want to do recovery. But why does the deletion of the recovery partition affect the kbdopt/alt/kbd boot menu? How can I get it back?  <comment307884> Not encrypted. I think there's some tech details I don't know. If booting OS X doesn't depend on the recovery partition, why I can't select the disk? If it does depend on the recovery, what happened in the boot process? <comment307896> Boot to Internet Recovery Mode. There's no menu to open terminal, enter download process directly, may take 15 hours to finish, so I use Linux to print the partition table. Updated in the question. <comment307904> There's no classic OS X interface when I boot to Internet Recovery Mode. Just a world map and tell me "this may take a while", then a process bar and a timer.  What's information is needed? the gptfdisk's output seems the same as gparted's.
