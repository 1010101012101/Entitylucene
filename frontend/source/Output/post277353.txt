Did Spotlight change its ordering? <body> I've been using Spotlight forever, and it's been pretty good about putting your frequently used / manually chosen results at the top. Even if when you type the beginning of another program, it would still put what you frequently use at the top.  An example would be: I use iTerm over the built-in Terminal app. Whenever dealing with a new macOS install I'll bring up Spotlight, type "term", and manually select iTerm. Do that a couple of times and then Spotlight would just know to launch iTerm when typing in "term".  For the past week though, Spotlight has been acting differently where typing "term" will show the built-in Terminal app for a fraction of a second before showing iTerm. That fraction of a second is still too long and Spotlight ends up launching the wrong app.  It's minuscule, yeah, but the frustration is real.
