USB hard drive not showing up in finder <body> I have WD Passport USB HDD plugged into my MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015), but it doesn't show up in Finder.  I checked the log and it listed an error: codeSCSI Command for drive WXK1A71C3194 Status = 0 SCSI Status = 0x2 SCSI Sense Key = 0x4 ASC = 0x44 ASCQ = 0x0/code. I looked up the code and came up with this: "Hardware Error - internal target failure".  Is this HDD totally unrecoverable? Or is there a way to fix this?  hr  strongWhat I've tried so far:/strong  ul liI plugged in another WD Passport USB HDD and it is showing up. Only this particular USB HDD is not showing up. /li /ul  <comment337805> Can you try going into Disk Utility (Finder - Applications - Utilities - Disk Utility) and running First Aid on your disk? Also, do try plugging your problematic HDD into another computer and see if it shows up. <comment337806> Comment back `@owlswipe` with whether or not those steps work.
