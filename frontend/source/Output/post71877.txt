A way to open a new Finder window when double-clicking anywhere on the Desktop? <body> Is there an existing utility app or pref pane to accomplish this?  <answer71879> I don't know about any utility that can do exactly that.  However, I would recommend using BetterTouchTool to achieve similar effect.   <answer71901> I was able to do this with Better Touch Tool, as Anonymous mentioned. As a test, I set "Single Finger Tap Top Right" of the Trackpad to the pre-defined action "Open Finder." Presto, new Finder window.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XzxmO.png" alt="Better Touch Tool Preferences"
