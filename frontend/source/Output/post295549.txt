Phishing Mail AppleID <body> I got the following phishing email from “Apple”:     Your ApрIe ID ( xxx ) was used to sign in to other device. Date and   Time: 16 August 2017, 04:28 PM (GMT+10) Operating System: Linux      If you have not logged in recently and feel someone is logged in to   your account ,go to ApрIe ID ( Verification your account ) and update   your account.      ApрIe Suρρort   The “Verification your account” text contains a hyperlink to codehttps://t.co/ccFy4cn8jr?=redirect/code.  When I click that link I get redirected to what looks like the official Apple website. How is this possible? Has the codet.co/code link been adjusted/modified/redirected to protect people from going to the malicious website?    When I submit the HTTP request I receive the following response:  precode&lt;head&gt;     &lt;noscript&gt;         &lt;META http-equiv="refresh" content="0;URL=https://appleld.apple.com.3c8fcfcffe480bc910-verify.info/?adu"&gt;     &lt;/noscript&gt;     &lt;title&gt;https://appleld.apple.com.3c8fcfcffe480bc910-verify.info/?adu&lt;/title&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;script&gt;window.opener = null; location.replace("https:\/\/appleld.apple.com.3c8fcfcffe480bc910-verify.info\/?adu”)&lt;/script&gt; /code/pre  Visiting codehttps://appleld.apple.com.3c8fcfcffe480bc910-verify.info/?adu/code correctly triggers a “Malicious site detected” warning, unlike clicking the original codet.co/code link.  What is happening here? strongWhy does clicking the codet.co/code link take me to the legitimate Apple website, when I should instead be redirected to a phishing website?/strong Is it possible I am done any harm here caused by cross site scripting? Or is it only redirecting to a fake website?   <answer295572> Editing, because I'm as confused as the original poster now. Expanding the t.co link via CheckShortURL, yields a google.ca redirect to apple.com/errors/us_error.html , not the bad account page.  I can't find anywhere that ends up at 3c8fcfcffe480bc910-verify.info  ....  ....  ....  (original answer below)  t.co is a url shortening/alias service  But, that link is not taking you to the apple page, but a subdomain of code3c8fcfcffe480bc910-verify.info/code  Phishing attacks like that are designed to make people see "oh, it has apple.com in the url, so it must be safe".  But, follow the URL all the way to the end.  <comment373252> The t.co address did indeed take me to a phishing site: "https://appleld.apple.com.3c8fcfcffe480bc910-verify.info/Page.php?sslEnabled=true&appldKey=URLsnipped&path=/signin/?referrer=/account/manage"  The page is a look-alike copy of a real Apple page, but all the links on the page are internal, and clicking on them does nothing. The only functioning feature is the sign-in window’s ability to capture your Apple ID. The culprit site "3c8fcfcffe480bc910-verify.info" has an IP address of 62.4.16.89, which belongs to the French hosting company Dedibox. <comment373254> The t.co redirect address is still taking me to the phishing site. It may be that after being notified of the situation, Twitter altered its t.co shortened URL to redirect instead to an Apple error page, as your URL checker showed, but that my DNS servers are still serving up cached information. <comment373287> It's not Apple's site, it's a copy.
