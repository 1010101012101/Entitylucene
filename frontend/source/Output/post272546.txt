MacBook will not boot to recovery after setting boot args <body> I booted to recovery using Command R.  I was trying to get to safe mode so I opened a terminal window here and ran:  precodenvram boot-args="-x" /code/pre  and then I rebooted. The system did not go to safe mode.  Rebooted again pressing Command R, but the system will not boot to recovery. All I get now is a circle with a line through it. How can I fix this?  <answer272547> ol liBoot with ⌘S to boot to single-user mode./li liRemove the boot arguments by running codenvram -d boot-args/code./li liReboot by running codereboot/code./li /ol  For future reference, you can boot to safe mode for a specific boot by holding ⇧ on boot without needing to set any boot arguments.
