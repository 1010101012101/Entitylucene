Prevent Safari 10.x from auto-downloading files? <body> Is it possible to prevent Safari from auto downloading files? Kind of like how Firefox does it.  To be clear, I am not asking about auto-unzipping, but rather webpages that auto start downloads for nefarious dmg files.  <answer264605> To stop Safari from automatically downloading files (and instead ask you with a prompt before downloading):  ol liOpen Safari, and go to codeSafari/code - codePreferences/code in the menubar (or hit kbdcommand/kbd+kbd,/kbd)/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/94TlR.jpg" alt="step 1 image"  br  ol start="2" liGo to the codeGeneral/code tab and hit the dropdown next to codeFile download location/code. Choose strongAsk for each download./strong/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9ebap.jpg" alt="step 2 image"  hr  Now, if I navigate to the download page for something (for example, the 1Password browser extension) and download it, a download prompt will appear before the file begins to download:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8RWEG.png" alt="download prompt"  br  Indeed, the file does not download until I click codeSave/code. If I click codeCancel/code, the downloads menu shows me that Zero KB of the file was downloaded:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JngDA.png" alt="zero kb"  Asking before each download is a great way to prevent malicious DMGs from being downloaded onto your Mac, but you can read this great answer that explains why these steps I've outlined are completely unnecessary, because DMGs can't harm your computer until you manually eminstall/em them.
