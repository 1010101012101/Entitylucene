Yosemite volume up and down doesn't make a feedback sound <body> Instead of playing a sound when volume up/down is pressed on the keyboard it now plays a sound when you hold down SHIFT + Vol Up / Vol Down.  How does one configure it to work like it did before?  <answer150931> This is an intentional change of the preferences.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IgdYb.png" alt="enter image description here"  You can turn the audio feedback back on in System Preferences - Sound and checking codePlay feedback when volume is changed/code  <answer157212> Perhaps you want to leave it as it is right now, I prefer it this way because sometimes the click sound it produces can be painful (any way, now on Yosemite it doesn't sound that loud). What I do when I want to hear the volume indicator is to press "shift + volume key" and it will play the volume indicator again just for that time.  <comment187486> The noise is different as well. Not sure how I feel about this - like when my mood ring was stolen. <comment205409> Nice tip, worth noting that if you have the ```Play feedback when volume is changed``` setting on, you can also hold shift when adjusting the volume and it will mute the volume indicator for just that time (ie the shift is a temporary toggle for whatever the current setting is). <comment214554> Note for geeks: try shift+opt while changing volume)
