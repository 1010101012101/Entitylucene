New Mac Mini (late 2014) sound input - says "No input devices found" <body> I have just bought a new Mac Mini Late 2014. I noticed that the System Preferences  Sound says that there is no sound input device. This is causing me lots of problems in the app I'm developing in XCode.  My older 2012 Mac Mini shows an "Audio line-in port" and my app works.  Is there something wrong with my new Mac Mini? How can I get it to recognise the input port?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YJQDq.png" alt="No input devices found"  <answer181008> Try this:  Resetting the SMC and PRAM for Mac Pro, Intel-based iMac, Intel-based Mac mini, or Intel-based Xserve  • Shut down the computer. • Unplug the computer's power cord. • Wait fifteen seconds. • Attach the computer's power cord. • Locate the following keys on the keyboard: Command, Option, P, and R.

When I plug a microphone in it is recognised and shows up on this screen, and my game works. On a Mac Mini 2012 I don't need to plug in a microphone and "No input devices found" is never displayed.
