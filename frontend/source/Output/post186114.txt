The ability to perform quick search on Bing? <comment219711> I mean when i search something through Spotlight app, it must show results have founded in internet in addition to results have founded inside my mac. <comment219712> Bing Web Searches checkbox already has checked.  <comment219727> Wikipedia results? Can you give a screenshot or example on the web because I haven't seen any results from the "internet" in spotlight? Internet is quite vague. <comment219855> I added a sample image to my question. this image is from this link: http://www.macworld.com/article/2369722/hands-on-with-os-x-yosemite-spotlight-takes-center-stage.html There is a full review of new Spotlight features.
