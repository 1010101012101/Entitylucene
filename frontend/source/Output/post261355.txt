I have system files in my trash that won't delete or 'put back'. What to do? <body> I thought my computer had downloaded a virus, using an app I located the file and accidentally tossed a folder hierarchy that was inside the privatevar hidden folders. Everything deleted and emptied except for zzzyxvpxvq6csfxvn_n0000000000000CDeferredInstallFixUP.file_list AND zzzyxvpxvq6csfxvn_n0000000000000CPKInstallSandboxManager-System Software  Neither of the files has been modified since dropping in two months ago so, the computer has obviously re-written those files in the location that they were. How do I return them or clean them off my trash?  <comment327308> Is SIP on? In Terminal, type `csrutil status`. If it's enabled, boot to Recovery & set `csrutil disable`, reboot, test; set back to enabled afterwards. <comment327331> Are those paths you have relative to ~/.Trash or to /private/var?
