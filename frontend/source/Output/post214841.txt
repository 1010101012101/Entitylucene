Is it possible to bind my Mac OSX Dictionary.app to Google Translate? <body> The Dictionary App has a very cool experience on MacOSX. But I have to install dictionaries to use. Is it possible to bind it to Google Translate?  Thanks!  <answer214859> Unfortunately it doesn't appear to be possible, or at least straightforward. As an alternative, you may want to consider creating an OS X emService/em that opens Google Translate in a browser window, for any highlighted word or phrase you have selected.  If this sounds suitable, follow the procedure below:  h2Creating a translation Service/h2  ul liOpen the codeAutomator/code app from your codeApplications/code folder/li liSelect codeService/code as the type of document and click codeChoose/code/li liIn the window that appears, click the search field and type 'AppleScript'/li liDrag and drop the codeRun AppleScript/code action from the list on the left into the area labelled 'Drag actions or files here to build your workflow'/li /ul  Copy the script below and paste it into the codeRun Applescript/code action:  precodeon run {input, parameters}     set phrase to input as string     set phrase to quoted form of phrase      set ui_lang to "en"     set from_lang to "en"     set to_lang to "zh-CN"      do shell script "open 'https://translate.google.com/?hl='" &amp; ui_lang &amp; "'&amp;sl='" &amp; from_lang &amp; "'&amp;tl='" &amp; to_lang &amp; "'&amp;text='" &amp; phrase end run /code/pre  Your window should look like the following:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Vn3Lq.png" alt="Automator workflow"  There are three values that you may want to change in the above script:  ul licodeui_lang/code - the language used for the page interface/li licodefrom_lang/code - the source language/li licodeto_lang/code - the destination language/li /ul  Change one or more of these to achieve the desired translation. To find the correct language parameters, refer to the Language Reference. In the example above codeen/code refers to codeEnglish/code, and codezh-CN/code to Chinese (Simplified).  After making your changes, click codeFile/code  codeSave.../code and in the panel that appears type a suitable name (e.g. codeTranslate English to Chinese/code).  hr  h2Using the translation Service/h2  After saving your workflow above, you can make use of your translation service with one of the following two methods:   strong1. The Service Menu method/strong  ul liHighlight a word or phrase in any application/li liClick the Application Menu to the right of the Apple icon (ï£¿), then click codeServices/code and codeTranslate English to Chinese/code (or the name you gave your Service when saving it):/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JUEF9.png" alt="Service menu example"  strong2. The Contextual Menu method/strong  ul liHighlight a word or phrase in any application/li liRight-click the text and select codeServices/code then codeTranslate English to Chinese/code (or your custom named Service):/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wYHfZ.png" alt="Contextual menu example"  hr  Whichever method you use, a browser window should appear with your translated text:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/90yFP.png" alt="Google Translate example"  <comment259473> It doesn't look like it would work, at least without extensive hacking and rebuilding of the Dictionary app and extension because as it stands custom dictionaries are static and aren't programs which means that I can't just write a "dictionary" which takes the text and translates. <comment343913> Wow. This is bad-ass. thank you so much.
