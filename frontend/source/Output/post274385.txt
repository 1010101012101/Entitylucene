How to restrict spotlight index size? <body> I found that Spotlight directory code/.Spotlight-V100/code is about 13G, and it looks like Spotlight tries to fill almost entire disk space leaving only about 1G. Is it possible to restrict the size of this directory to a certain size?  Re-indexing of the disk helps to clean this folder, but I would prefer an automated way. I use Mac Os X 10.7.5 (Lion).  UPD: after re-indexing the the folder still takes 7.9G  <comment345015> There is a similar question, but the index file was not really huge http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/180374/spotlight-data-size-to-big
