How to convert a chain into a number <body> In Apple Numbers I want a cell to have 4x8x7 (or 4*8*7) to show the detail of the volume, and in another cell I want that volume calculated 4*8*7=224 based on the first cell. But it doesn't consider the first cell as an operation. Which formula can help ?  <answer82724> You could use the string concatenation operator '&amp;' and make a formula like this:  =B2&amp;" X "&amp;B3&amp;" X "&amp;B4 which would display "4 X 8 X 7"  then have another formula that actually calculates the function:  =B2*B3*B4 which would display "224"  http://i.imgur.com/9ggakhc.png  <answer82798> I was given this answer on another website:br put =4*8*7 in the first cell, set it to emtext/em format, duplicate it and set it to emautomatic/em format so that it calculates the result  <comment95400> I was working on a convoluted formula with multiple SEARCH and MID functions, then realized this was a far more straightforward approach. <comment95463> I would have to fill 3 more cells manually, something I would rather avoid having to do
