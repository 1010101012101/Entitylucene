MInimize all windows except active <body> I'm aware of all the hide all / minimize all shortcuts (cmd + alt + h/m) and am looking into something more sophisticated: I want to minimize all windows except strongactive/strong one – like the Shake function in windows 7 (Link)  I work with lots of chrome windows and I have to focus on strongone/strong of them  Thanks a ton for your help!  <answer119961> There are third party applications you can purchase that mimic Aero Shake / Aero Snap features.  See here: http://www.irradiatedsoftware.com/cinch/  Here is an article on another app that can do it: http://lifehacker.com/5873264/isnap-brings-aero-snap-and-shake-to-minimize-to-the-mac  <answer145380> Select strongHide Others/strong from the active application menu, or use shortcut kbdalt ⌥/kbd+kbdcmd ⌘/kbd+kbdH/kbd  <answer277229> Not the straightest way to accomplish it, but better than "hide others" or "buy 3rd party app".  ul liGo to "Window" menu to get a notion of what name or number your current window has;/li liMinimize them all: kbd⌥/kbdkbd⌘/kbdkbdM/kbd (or just hold kbd⌥/kbd to get "All" while at "Window" menu);/li liThen, while you still have minimized app's active focus, you can either press kbdcontrol/kbdkbd↓/kbd to get preview of its windows or you can try finding window you need using windows list in "Window" menu./li /ul  P. S. Not strictly necessarily but rather useful to have window minimisation effect changed from Genie to Scale (I'd prefer to turn off animation at all but unlikely there's such an option); Genie is noticeably (more) slow when you have a bunch of windows minimizing at once  <comment139926> Thanks, but neither of them work for Chrome (which I'm using most) in hiding the windows. <comment139927> The best thing to do would be to create a script for alt+s/h for example to hide all windows except focused <comment139955> Why not just "Hide Others" with cmd-opt-H? <comment139989> because it will just hide other apps and all the windows of Chrome will remain there. I need to hide all WINDOWS (even of the same app I am using) except for active one <comment171346> Why not make the one to concentrate on full screen then everything else is hidden? <comment235476> @Mark who asks "Why not make the one to concentrate on full screen then everything else is hidden?"  // A: because that only works completely on a singkle display.  On multiple displays, other windows stay visible. Which may or may not be what you want. // Also, because sometimes apps won't maximize, or because sometimes the window geometry must stay fixed. <comment315997> hide others isn't the answer. the osx window manager groups windows together by app. so "hiding others" actually just hides other apps, not other windows. :/ <comment373105> Thanks for the tip! Using BetterTouchTool (a third-party app, but extremely useful) I bound both steps to one key combination (CTL + ALT + M) which first minimizes the windows (ALT + CMD + M) and then brings up the Exposé (CTRL + ↓). <comment373116> You're welcome. I added a note about Scale/Genie there — since I'm here again :)
