Is a Power Mac G4 a good candidate for a home server? <body> A friend of mine has offered to give me a Power Mac G4 that he is no longer using. I haven't picked it up yet, but it sounds like it is a single core 1.25 GHz 2003 "Mirrored Drive Door" Model. I have been considering setting up a home server, and I'm wondering if this would be a good candidate. It will take four drives internally, and with a PCI card like this http://www.firmtek.com/seritek/seritek-1v4/ it will support SATA drives (if only at 1.5 GBit/sec). The single core also means it will be a little less power hungry, (I read ~80W idle--not great, but could be worse). I have also heard these can be noisy, but I'm not worried about that given the planned location.  Initially I had just planned to use it as a fileserver, to serve media to a couple of Apple TVs, smaller, everyday stuff to the rest of the home network (MacBook Pro x2, MacBook Air, iMac, iPad, and one Windows Terminal), and to run regular backups on everything. Now I'm thinking I might also like to use it as a light duty web and email server, and what I would emreally/em like to do is set up network accounts for all the machines. I'm not sure how feasible is, given the Power Mac uses a PowerPC chip and everything else is Intel. I imagine I'd have to find a copy of OS X Server (10.5 or earlier).  I'm getting the machine for free, and I'd really like to get some more good use out of it even if it means spending a little time and money on the project, but does it make sense to go this route? Definitely open to other ideas/suggestions on what I could do with it instead.  <comment284990> ahhh, the old 'wind tunnel'- noisy machines, those... & really not fast enough or compatible enough these days, I got rid of my last one maybe 8 years or so ago, already too slow. TBH, I wouldn't bother, you could pick up a generic basic PC [core 2 duo or above] for a few quid from a junk shop & have more compatibility out of the box.
