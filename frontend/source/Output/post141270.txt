License Keys not Transferred in Time Machine Restore <body> I have just restored a Time Machine backup to a new disk, and I am finding that I need to re-enter scores of licenses for specific applications (while others seem to be retained without issue). Specifically, I am using RapidWeaver, and most of the Stacks require license keys. They must be stored somewhere, but I have yet to be able to determine the location. I would like to restore that directory from a backup to avoid countless hours of data re-entry.   Can someone point out where this information is stored? It doesn't have to be specific to RapidWeaver, even though that would be helpful. I just want to know where to look to be able to restore my previous keys, in order to save a bit of time.  <answer141271> It looks like the files I want are stored in code\~Library\Preferences/code under each stack's specific plist file. I don't quite understand why none of them transferred over from the original backup, but I am hopeful they will copy over when I visit the Time Machine backup.
