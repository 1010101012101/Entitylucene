How do I set up SSH to open a single application? <body> iMac 7,1 running OSX 10.10.3 Dell Inspiron 740, running Windows 7 Home Premium  My aging mother has a Windows PC and a Mac, which she prefers using. Sometimes my dad is using the Mac, so she's stuck using the Windows PC (it's specifically for her) until he's done. Her favorite part of the Mac is using the Mail app, which I've tried time and again to find an equivalent, but nothing's got everything.

However, OS X does come with VNC built in, if you want to share screens from Windows. It's under Sharing in System Preferences, check the box for 'Screen Sharing'.
