Why does AirPort Utility support file sharing? <body> The AirPort utility app for the iPhone allows you to share documents between a computer and an iOS device.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pohWT.png" alt="enter image description here"  What kind of documents, if any, would I share between my Mac and the AirPort utility app?  <answer53465> This is so that you can load configuration profiles. Say you want to set up a campus network where all the base stations have the same network name, admin password (or printing password or iCloud accounts).   This will allow you to make a copy of a configuration and load it from iOS to a computer or the other way for standardized setup.  <comment61189> That seems logical. Thanks.
