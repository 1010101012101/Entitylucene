Clean install macOS onto Mac with Windows 7 only install currently <body> I have a Mac which I gave to my IT guy to install Windows 7 and he did so by deleting all the macOS partitions. So can anyone tell me how can I install macOS again?  <comment354625> Did you ask your IT guy to wipe macOS off your Mac in the process of installing Windows? If the normal Recovery HD won't boot, for whatever reason, damaged or removed, I'd suggest you use Internet Recovery, if supported on your model Mac, and wipe Windows, reinstall macOS and if you want Windows too, then install it properly after restoring macOS.
