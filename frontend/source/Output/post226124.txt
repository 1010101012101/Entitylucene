Where to insert a custom item in /etc/hosts file? <body> The default /etc/hosts file looks like this:  precode127.0.0.1   localhost 255.255.255.255 broadcasthost ::1 localhost fe80::1%lo0 localhost /code/pre  If I want to insert a custom item, should I insert it after the strongfirst line/strong?  precode127.0.0.1   localhost 127.0.0.1   website.dev ... /code/pre  Or should I add it after the stronglast line/strong?  precode... fe80::1%lo0 localhost 127.0.0.1   website.dev /code/pre  I've seen both, but can anyone explain what the difference is?  <answer226125> You can add it anywhere you want in the body of the file.  Additionally the following works also:  precode127.0.0.1   localhost website.dev website.org /code/pre  and for me even this works (but I don't think it's recommended):  precode127.0.0.1   localhost, website.dev, website.org /code/pre  For the sake of a better overview I prefer:  precode127.0.0.1   localhost 127.0.0.1   website.dev 127.0.0.1   website.org 255.255.255.255 broadcasthost ...IPv6 stuff... /code/pre  <answer226127> I guess the only difference would be that if you write your own lines after the first one, they will be found earlier than if they are in the last lines. As long as you don't have a huge amount of lines in your code/etc/hosts/code file that shouldn't really make a difference though.  I personally would add my own entries after the last line because I like to clearly separate my own stuff from the system's default stuff.  <comment274556> What if we move `website.dev` above the default `localhost`, will that cause trouble? <comment274557> @Pangloss No, this won't cause any trouble.
