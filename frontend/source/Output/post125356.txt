Reconfiguring Ctrl on a MacBook Pro's keyboard to another key <body> I have a problem with the left kbd⇧/kbd and kbdctrl/kbd on my MacBook Pro (mid 2012).  I can use the right kbd⇧/kbd but since there's only one kbdctrl/kbd, I was wondering because there are two kbd⌥/kbd buttons and two kbd⌘/kbd buttons, if I could reconfigure one of them to replace the control feature.  Is there a way to do this?  <answer125360> Install KeyRemap4MacBook, save a file like this as code~/Library/Application Support/KeyRemap4MacBook/private.xml/code:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;   &lt;item&gt;     &lt;name&gt;test&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;identifier&gt;test&lt;/identifier&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::OPTION_R, KeyCode::CONTROL_R&lt;/autogen&gt;   &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  Then open the KeyRemap4MacBook application, press the ReloadXML button, and enable the setting.  <comment146704> Please define your issue, will a replacement of keys work? What did you do with your keyboard? <comment146706> He did not do anything to his keyboard. There is only one Ctrl on MB-keyboards. He wonders why there are two shift, two apple and two alt keys.
