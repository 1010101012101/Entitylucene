Can Mail.app be configured to always load remote images from certain domains? <body> I like how Gmail gives me the option to, for example, codeAlways display images from allsongs@n.npr.org/code.   Is there a way to have Mail.app do the same? I can only find the global option for displaying remote images in HTML messages.  <answer52806> h3Short answer/h3  There is no specific option for this.

Give name strongtheRule/strong to your new role and select conditions that you want to display remote images. For your question this should be codeFrom/code  codeallsongs@n.npr.org/code.  ul liYou could also select codeSender is in my Address Book/code to display remote images for all mails come from  your contacts./li /ul/li liUnder codePerform the following actions:/code section, select codeRun Applescript/code and choose the file you wrote at step 1./li liSave the rule./li /ol  h3Applescript/h3  precode--BEGINNING OF SCRIPT using terms from application "Mail" on perform mail action with messages theMessages for rule theRule tell application "Mail" activate repeat with eachMessage in theMessages open eachMessage tell application "System Events" to tell process "Mail" set loadButton to a reference to button 1 of UI element 1 of row 1 of table 1 of scroll area 1 of front window if loadButton exists then click loadButton end if end tell end repeat end tell end perform mail action with messages end using terms from --END OF SCRIPT /code/pre  <answer159031> Use Thunderbird instead of Apple Mail.  <comment173409> This does not work in Mail 7.3 (OS X 10.9)
