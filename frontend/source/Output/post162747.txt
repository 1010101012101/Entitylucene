Can't open file from external NTFS disk <body> I am using OS X 10.9.4.  I have my music library on an external NTFS disk.  When I open these files in iTunes, there are no problems. However, when I view the files in Finder, the icons are grey.  If I try to open them, I get the following message:     [The file] can’t be opened right now because it’s being used by another task, such as moving or copying an item or emptying the Trash. Try again when the current task is complete.   Furthermore, I can only find the file by selecting "Show in Finder" in iTunes.  Otherwise, the folder just doesn't show up in Finder.  I recognize that I clearly need to get this library on a differently formatted disk, but I don't currently have a drive on which to back it up.  Is there a way I can access these files immediately, while I'm still unable to reformat the disk?  <comment190364> Did you try quitting iTunes. <comment190377> Good call, Buscar, but yes, I quit everything that could possibly be using the file. Things that there was definitely absolutely no reason to quit. Even a little bit. I committed in a big way to that effort to no avail. <comment190378> Ha, I used `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` to get to the file I desperately needed, so that solved my immediate problem, in the short term. I'm still anxious for a less ridiculous solution though (I'm pretty confident that wasn't the best approach here...).
