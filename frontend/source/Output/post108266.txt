Books not purchased in iBooks Store are not syncing between Mavericks and iPhone <body> After upgrading to OS X Mavericks, I added some ebooks bought directly from publishers, such as O'Reilly, by dragging them into the iBooks app. However, when I use iBooks on my iPhone, the ebooks aren't showing up. Is iBooks able to sync books not purchased via the iBooks Store? If so, what am I missing?  h2MacBook Configuration/h2  ul li13" MacBook Pro Retina with OS X 10.9 Mavericks/li liiBooks ver 1.0 (build 169)/li liSettings  General Preferences  Sync is checked/li liI have performed File  "Move Books from iTunes..."/li liI have authorized this computer from within the iBooks app/li /ul  h2iPhone Configuration/h2  ul liiPhone 4S with iOS 7.0.3 (11B511)/li liiBooks has both Sync Bookmarks and Sync Collections enabled/li liI have confirmed that I'm using the same Apple ID on the MacBook and iPhone/li /ul  <answer111222> You have to use iTunes.  Open iTunes, click on your device and then choose the Books tab. There you can select which books you want to sync to your iOS device.  It appears to sync your pages placement too.  <answer112318> I assume the book in question doesn't show up in iTunes when syncing your iPhone?  You have to get the epub onto your iPhone and open it with iBooks. I used Dropbox to get it on there, I assume Mail would also work. If it states that it can't show epub files, just use the share button to open with iBooks.  <comment127020> Adding this as a comment rather than an answer as I'm not certain, though I have emailed Apple a similar question. I don't think you can sync books that were not purchased via the iBooks store across devices. Yet. <comment127028> @gentlemanhog â€” Let me know what you find out. I was afraid that might be the answer. <comment312977> (Almost 3 years later!) Yes, you can now sync ePubs (and PDFs) not purchased via the iBooks store across devices provided you have an iCloud account.
