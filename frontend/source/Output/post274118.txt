How to bring an application to the front, no bouncing dock icons <body> In my AppleScript, I use codeactivate/code to bring an application to the front. However, on machines of some colleagues, it doesn't do that. The app-icon in the dock will bounce, but it doesn't get put into the front. This is very annoying, because the user has to go to the app manually every time.  I suspect this is due to some setting or something. Any ideas how to accomplish this?
