Paste to Subfolder in Finder List View <body> Is it possible to paste a file to a subfolder in Finder with the keyboard?  I can paste into it with the mouse (using the paste command from the context menu) but codeCMD-V/code will always paste to the parent folder:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sJcC8.gif" alt="finder"  I'm looking for a solution where I don't have to go into the subfolder before I paste.  <answer153715> So I just tried it.  I have to move the focus from the Finders sidebar by double clicking on the Test folder and that will open a new tab, new finder window.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qg8WU.jpg" alt="folder"  Then highlight the test-1 and use cmd-v  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SULQw.jpg" alt="test-1"  Means, as long you have a Folder highlighted in the Finders sidebar it will copy it there.  <answer153718> Basically, your way of viewing the folders in the OS means that in the over-arching parent folder that you opened the finder window in will be the folder that it detects you to be in causing your CMD+V to paste into this folder.   Even if you've expanded sub-folders the OS has made it so that in this viewing format you haven't actually entered the folder so the paste still occurs in the highest parent folder.  Try opening the folder with a double click on the folder name or change your viewing format to columns so checking the contents of folders, like it seems like you want to, is easy but pasting to specific places becomes possible.  <comment180927> Lovely animation :) <comment180928> @Buscarì›ƒ it's easy with GifGrabber (appstore) <comment180933> Not sure I understand. I'm not using the sidebar - I wat to paste inside the List view. <comment180942> I am also using the list view, but the bar in Finder is showing the Test folder (the parent folder), see in my screen shot
