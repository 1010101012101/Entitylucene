Delete unplayable, partially copied movie from TV app? <body> I have a movie in the TV app on my iPad (running 10.3.1) that I want to delete. It is listed in the app, but when I go to General  Storage &amp; iCloud Usage  Manage Storage  TV, I do not see it listed. In fact, I tried copying the file over from my computer using iMazing, and it failed to copy all of it, and now it is listed in the app.  How do I delete or get rid of the partially copied, unplayable movie from the TV app? It is unfortunately taking up a couple of gigabytes on my iPad.
