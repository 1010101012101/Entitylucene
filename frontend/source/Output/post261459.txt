Some songs don't play in iTunes on macOS <body> Some of the songs in my iTunes library refuse to play. When I double click on them, nothing happens. When I play the song before it and then skip over to the next song, it actually skips the song and thus goes forward 2 songs. There is nothing different about this song, it's part of an album where every song plays just fine, it's not unchecked or anything.  When I find this song in my Finder and play it through VLC, it plays absolutely fine, no problem at all.  I am not using Apple Music, but I do have iTunes Match. This song has the status "matched" and is downloaded to my computer. Removing the downloading and fetching it again doesn't help.  <comment327469> Are you sure you're not seeing this... http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/230250/gray-itunes-album-tracks/230252#230252 <comment327502> Yep, like I said: it's not unchecked. It doesn't show gray, and most importantly, it doesn't play even when double clicking.
