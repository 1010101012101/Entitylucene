What is shutdown cause -60? <body> Since installing Mavericks on my 2010 MBP, it seems to be giving me the spinning beach ball often. I think I may need a new HDD, as Disk Utility cannot repair it, but I also get this error:  precodeNov 21 20:33:38 COMPUTERNAME kernel[0] &lt;Debug&gt;: Previous Shutdown Cause: -60 /code/pre  <answer111607> strong-60 is badMDBErr (bad master directory block error)/strong  It indicates that there is something wrong with the drive, and Disk Utility not being able to repair the drive supports this.
