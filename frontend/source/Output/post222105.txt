FileVault: How come a new user can log in without disk password? <body> I thought I had enabled full volume encryption on my OS X 10.9.5 MBP. Then I created a new user and when rebooting, this new user is able to log in without knowing the password for the disk.  The start up screen is presented with the new user to the left and the normal "Unlock disk" (or something like that) icon to the right – if I want to log in with my normal admin account, I first have to unlock the disk and then my user becomes visible.  What gives?  <answer222106> From Apple KB - Use FileVault to encrypt the startup disk on your Macbr Emphasis mine...     strongEnable users/strong      If you enable FileVault on a Mac with more than one user account, you're asked to identify which users can unlock your startup disk as part of setup. Click Enable next to a user name to let that user log in to your Mac at startup. Then, enter the password for that account.      Users that you don't enable can't unlock the startup disk. These users aren't able to use your Mac until after an enabled user logs in.        strongemAny new user accounts you create after you turn on FileVault are automatically enabled./em/strong   <comment269050> You had several questions in here. This site works better when there is only one question per question. That way, it's easier for other people to find solutions if they have the same problem. I've edited out your other questions, but feel free to ask it separately. <comment269069> Thanks! So – this means that the totally insecure password that I've assigned to the new user actually unlocks my full disk encryption? <comment269074> Yes, as you've [albeit unwittingly] allowed that. If you disable it, then they will have no access whatsoever until you unlock it… then they'll have access. Depending on whether it's an admin or restricted account will change what they then have access to.
