Can I purchase regular DDR3 RAM for my MAC (not from an iMac store?) <body> I know that buying and installing RAM from a regular computer shop will be cheaper for me. I was just wondering if a Macbook Pro 17" early 2011 model uses specific 'Mac' DDR3 RAM or if I can get away with any DDR3 RAM?  <answer106997> Generally in principle yes. You do not need to purchase expensive Apple memory.  However strongyou will need to check for each model/strong - the best thing is to go to a reputable memory supply company website which sells certified RAM and look up your model.  You can search for them online but here is a respected store (I have no affiliations with)  http://www.crucial.com  <answer107007> Just be sure the memory you buy meets the specifications on Apple's website.  It's a very common type of  memory,  204-pin PC3-10600 DDR3 1333 MHz.  <answer107027> Although memory chips conform to standards, there could be some minor variations. So it is advisable to buy from a seller who tests and guarantees compatibility of the RAM sticks for your Mac.  Two such stores in the U.S. that have served customers for a long time are strongOWC/strong - MacBook Pro 2011 RAM and strongData Memory Systems/strong - MacBook Pro RAM. These are usually cheaper than Crucial and offer good warranties.
