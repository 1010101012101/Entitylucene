Install linux on Mac mini 2.1 with broken CD drive <body> My CD drive is broken and the option of creating bootable flash drive is also out, because mac mini 2.1's firmware doesn't support it. Is there a way how to install linux from hard drive? I tried doing it with UNetbootin as shown here https://askubuntu.com/questions/484434/install-ubuntu-without-cd-and-usb-how, but the mac version of this program doesn't have an option of Hard drive in the corresponding select box.  I tried paritioning the main Os X partition into 2 partitions and then creating the second bootable via Unetbootin(yes I said it doesn't have Hard drive option, however, the second partition(empty, FAT formatted) showed available under "Type: USB Drive"), but when I use Startup Disk from System Preferences or hold option key while rebooting, I can see just standard OS X or recovery OS X.  Any suggestions for how to do it? I have administrator rights and I even don't care about wiping current OS X. I just want to use the mac's hardware for linux.
