Partition cloned disk <body> I cloned a disk with dd on linux and want to be able to use the entire disk, but I'm not sure how as I don't think the OS is recognizing the free space that is unpartitioned. In Disk Utility, I can't select a size larger than 120GB (the size of my old SSD) despite the new one being 250GB.  codediskutil list/code output:  precode/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *250.1 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            119.2 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3 /code/pre  codesudo gpt -r show disk0/code output:  precode      start       size  index  contents           0          1         PMBR           1          1         Pri GPT header           2         32         Pri GPT table          34          6                   40     409600      1  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B      409640  232762432      2  GPT part - 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC   233172072    1269536      3  GPT part - 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC   234441608  253955560 /code/pre  <answer258557> Your GUID partition table lacks its backup part: the second GPT header and table.

I recommend ethernet because it's more reliable. If you are restricted to WIFI and the boot process fails, just restart your Mac until you succeed booting.  Alternatively you may start from a bootable installer thumb drive (preferably El Capitan or Sierra) or a thumb drive containing a full system (preferably El Capitan or Sierra)./li /ul  strongRepair partition table/strong  ul liOpen in the menubar Utilities  Terminal and get an overview:  precodediskutil list /code/pre  You will presented with at least 13 disks.

Can you let me know what to do with gpt? <comment323227> @klanomath there you go <comment323229> The Sec GPT header and table are missing in the output - did you forget to copy them or are they absent? Usually they are in the last 33 blocks of a disk! <comment323230> @klanomath nope they are missing from the output... <comment323233> @user2544765, Do you still have the original 120 GB drive and does it still function or have you already wiped it? <comment323235> @user3439894 I have it still and it's still working yes. Not wpied. <comment323236> @user2544765, Then I'd either make a .dmg image of the entire 120 GB drive and restore it to the new drive or use [Carbon Copy Cloner](https://bombich.com) to clone it. `dd` is not necessarily a good way to go in this case. <comment323237> Will this lose data if I don't back up? Only reason I ask is because I won't bother with a backup since I have all of the data already. <comment323248> I ran into an issue with my solution and tried yours... it keeps saying that I can't unmount the disk because at least one volume could not be unmounted. forced gives me the same answer <comment323253> No... that did fail. it appears that the computer is booting from the recovery partition rather than Internet recovery. is there a way to force Internet recovery <comment323254> Let us [continue this discussion in chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/47357/discussion-between-klanomath-and-user2544765). <comment323439> Accepting because ultimately this answer led me to my particular solution, which was using everything in this answer except by doing it through a hard drive enclosure and booting from the other drive. <comment323440> @user2544765 Hmm did you examine why booting to Internet Recovery Mode failed? <comment323443> Ultimately I believe that the Mac in question is too old for that, as no matter how long I held the keys down it always booted from the recovery partition on the disk. <comment323444> @user2544765 If I remember correctly Mac models newer than ~2009-2010 should be able to boot to IRM. At least my MBP early 2011 does. <comment323445> Could be that this mac is a 2008 MacBook 5,1. Late 2008 aluminum model.
