How to force Startup Manager menu to appear at every boot? <body> Is there any way to force the Startup Manager menu to appear on every boot? Rather than me having to remember to hold down Alt if I want a different OS.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/knoLr.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer49866> I'm not sure this is possible by default without holding down the KBD⌥/KBD key at startup. You can make the Boot Camp partition always boot by selecting it in System Preferences → Startup Disk, but it sounds like this isn't what you want.    However, if you're not adverse to installing additional software, I think rEFIt may do what you need. The section on Getting into the rEFIt menu says:     If you have installed rEFIt on your Mac OS X volume, it will be loaded   automatically when the Mac starts up.   You should then be able to select whichever OS you want to boot from there.  <answer49872> You don't without modifying things on a low level or adding custom software like the awesome Boot Runner. When a mac can't find the first viable image to boot, it's programmed to get the prohibitory icon - not the boot picker.  img src="https://km.support.apple.com/library/APPLE/APPLECARE_ALLGEOS/TS1892/TS1892_1.gif"   Intel Macs have the following basic behavior at boot time when the chime indicates a successful POST.

The older question is about boot camp and this one could be all Mac OS or another OS. Also, this one has a nice picture and more detailed answers. <comment188507> Can you update your answer to link to rEFind instead, rEFit is no longer maintained. <comment188508> @AlvanoCalvillo - rEFit/rEFind worked just fine for me
