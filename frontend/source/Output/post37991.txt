Is there a way to assign global hot keys to go to the next/previous album in iTunes? <body> What is the easiest way to add ability to go to next and previous album (not track) using media keys with modifier key (like kbd⌥/kbd+kbdF7/kbd/kbdF8/kbd or any of kbd⇧/kbd, kbdctrl/kbd, kbd⌥/kbd, kbd⌘/kbd or kbdfn/kbd)?  Is it possible without using additional applications?  <answer38084> From http://www.usingmac.com/2007/11/21/mac-os-x-leopard-200-productivity-booster-hotkeys  precode153 Option-Right Arrow  Select next album 154 Option-Left Arrow   Select previous album /code/pre  <answer56253> Version 0.86 of ByteController can move to the next or previous song globally. http://awil.no/bytecontroller  <comment43132> I need global hot key. <comment64626> next/previous album, not song.
