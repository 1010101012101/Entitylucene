How to prevent getting kicked off wifi network? <body> There are two places where I've been using my Macbook, and it has been getting kicked off the network.  I know it isn't the network, because my phone can connect perfectly fine, and no one else on these networks is having trouble.  Also, I get the same problem in Safari, so I don't think it's the browser.  I get kicked off every 5 or 10 minutes, and when I try to get to a website, I see this error:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MigNL.png" alt="error that happens when I get kicked off"  Then, I click "Diagnose errors..." at the bottom of the error.  And, then it shows a screen like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QNe3C.png" alt="diagnostics at work"  Then, I just keep clicking "continue", again and again, and eventually it always ends up like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KRrEi.png" alt="network change detected somehow solves the problem"  And, then the problem is fixed and the network is working correctly again.    Why/how did this fix it?  And, what can I do to prevent it from kicking me off the network every time?  It's super annoying, to be honest.  <comment309945> Are you getting kicked-off the same network with other devices or is just your Mac?  The error you're getting looks like the problem is with the network not responding, not with your Mac. <comment309960> no no, only this device.  phone is fine, and no one else working on this network is having this problem. <comment309961> It looks like you're using Chrome.  Does the same thing happen when browsing the same sites in Safari? <comment309962> yes same thing happens in Safari. <comment309963> can't ping either:  `ping 8.8.8.8` returns with no response.
