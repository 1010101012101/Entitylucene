Can't log in to FaceTime with correct Apple ID <body> I am using the correct password for my Apple ID and it's still not logging me in. I'm logged in to FaceTime on my iPhone and normally it would let me be logged in on my iPhone and iPad and now it won't let me log in on my iPad. I've tried logging out on my iPhone but it's still not letting me.  <answer197115> This guide from apple could help you resolve FaceTime issues on your iPhone.  <answer197124> If you have two-factor authentication enabled for your AppleID, you will need to generate an app-specific password and then use that to log in to FaceTime on your iPad.  If this is the case, you will need to sign in to appleid.apple.com with your normal AppleID password, then click "Passwords and Security" and then "Generate an app-specific password".  When the password is generated, leave it open on the screen so you can type it into your device(s), as you won't be able to retrieve the password afterwards. You can, however, revoke your app-specific passwords individually, and can have up to 25 per AppleID.  Apple has support documents that provide information about two-factor authentication and about setting up app specific passwords.  <answer223711> I have an older ipod. It suddenly stopped letting me log into FaceTime or Messages. This is what finally worked for me after trying several things. Settings, then mail (mine also says contacts and calendars) then click on your email account that you use with your Facetime account. Delete the account. Turn the devise off then on. Go back in and set up that email account and password again. Worked for me.
