How to tell Apple if there are spelling mistakes in its application document? <body> For example I just installed some Apple software on my iPad. Before I start using it I need to agree its terms &amp; conditions.  While I was reading the terms &amp; conditions there are spelling mistakes I found in the document.  How should I report this to Apple?  <answer247329> Apple Bug Reporter is the essential site to report these issues.  You'll need to have a developer account though which you could always setup for free and that should gain you access to the Bug Reporting tool.  <answer247353> Apple has a lot of contact details on their website. At the bottom of it, there is a link to a list of feedback forms for various products and applications.  <comment305184> https://bugreport.apple.com - but I'd make sure they're not just US/UK English differences etc. <comment305235> Curious to know what was the spelling mistake!
