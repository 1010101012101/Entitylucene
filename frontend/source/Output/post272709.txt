Shortcut for Preview sketch tool <body> Nearly every time I open Preview.app I will then immediately press the toolbox button and then the sketch button.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JHcZd.png" alt="enter image description here"  Is there a shortcut to access the sketch tool or some way to put the sketch button on my default toolbar?  <answer272807> This workaround applies to strongPreview.app 9.0 (909.12)/strong in strongmacOS Sierra 10.12.2/strong and will most likely break in future releases.  ol liLaunch AppleScript Editor and enter the following.  precodetell application "System Events" to tell process "Preview"     activate     set markup to checkbox 1 of toolbar 1 of window 1     tell markup         if not (its value as boolean) then             click markup             delay 0.1         end if     end tell     set sketch to checkbox 1 of toolbar 2 of window 1     tell sketch         if not (its value as boolean) then             click sketch         end if     end tell end tell /code/pre/li liLaunch Preview, open a document, switch back to AppleScript Editor, and run your script.
