Can't connect to L2TP over IPSec VPN from Mac 10.12.4 <body> Have troubles with connecting to my VPN from Mac. Using default Mac client, pre-shared secret. Also this works well on iOS 10.3.2 from the same Wi-Fi network.  Firewall is disable, no Little Snitch. macOS error message says 'The L2TP-VPN server did not respond'  Also, I've tried to connect open free VPN, us.freel2tpvpn.com and got no response again, so I think it's a macOS problem, not the server / routing.  Do you have any ideas?  Here is my /var/log/ppp.log  precodeTue Jun 13 15:34:58 2017 : publish_entry SCDSet() failed: Success! Tue Jun 13 15:34:58 2017 : publish_entry SCDSet() failed: Success!

To do that, run the following commands in Terminal (you can copy and paste if you want):  precode/usr/bin/nc -uvw5 portquiz.net 500 /usr/bin/nc -uvw5 portquiz.net 1701 /usr/bin/nc -uvw5 portquiz.net 4500 /code/pre  You should get something that looks like this (note the three "succeeded" lines):  precodefound 0 associations found 1 connections:      1: flags=82&lt;CONNECTED,PREFERRED&gt;     outif en0     src 192.168.1.2 port 56916     dst 178.33.250.62 port 500     rank info not available     TCP aux info available  Connection to portquiz.net port 500 [tcp/isakmp] succeeded! found 0 associations found 1 connections:      1: flags=82&lt;CONNECTED,PREFERRED&gt;     outif en0     src 192.168.1.2 port 56917     dst 178.33.250.62 port 1701     rank info not available     TCP aux info available  Connection to portquiz.net port 1701 [tcp/l2f] succeeded! found 0 associations found 1 connections:      1: flags=82&lt;CONNECTED,PREFERRED&gt;     outif en0     src 192.168.1.2 port 56918     dst 178.33.250.62 port 4500     rank info not available     TCP aux info available  Connection to portquiz.net port 4500 [tcp/ipsec-msft] succeeded! /code/pre  If that works, then you should be able to connect, and the problem is likely the server, or a configuration problem (I've used the macOS L2TP client for a long time and haven't experienced any issues). If not, something is blocking an outgoing port.  <comment361724> Got the refused all the time, tried my l2tp server, and few free online l2tp services, which I also can't connect (same error — refused).  As far as I know, L2TP uses udp ports, so tcp port testing may be not enough. <comment361725> Whoops, forgot -u. Now it'll test UDP <comment361727> all succeeded.  I've restarted 'racoon' daemon, but no change. <comment361728> I assume you've reentered your credentials numerous times already, if you're at this point... Strange. <comment361731> What I would do at this point is use Wireshark on the VPN concentrator (server) to determine exactly what the iOS and macOS clients are doing differently. Things look to be failing before encryption's set up, which means you could gain some insight that way. Have you used Wireshark before? <comment361744> I've set up another one home vpn l2tp over ipsec (shared key) on Windows 10 and got same results — ios connects from the box, my mac still can't connect (no respond)  After that I've wiresharking 3 udp ports and saw the difference, mac seems sent much less than the iphone. <comment361752> If you can tell me what the last few packets received by the server contains, I may be able to tell you where it's failing. <comment361753> Let's continue here: https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/60388/cant-connect-to-l2tp-over-ipsec-vpn-from-mac-10-12-4 <comment362075> sorry, not enough reputation to join chats <comment370563> i have the same problem as well. After update my system my l2tp connection broken. I have my own vpn server. Im using softether vpn on ubuntu. I can connect with my ios 10 devices on same wifi but my 10.12.6 MacOS is not connecting.
