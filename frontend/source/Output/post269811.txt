External monitor has blurry font on a MBP retina <body> There are indeed countless of these questions, some of them succesfully answered. I recently purchased an ACER R241Y.  I started using Sketch and noticed the fonts quality was emnoticeably worse/em when on the Acer.  System Information:  precodeEl Capitan 10.11.6 (15G1217) MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Late 2013) /code/pre  Here are the screenshots: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8ns5H.png" alt="external" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Wp0M3.png" alt="built-in"  I tried the infamous patch: Force RGB mode in Mac OS X to fix the picture quality of an external monitor, the codedefaults write NSGlobalDomain AppleFontSmoothing -integer X/code setting.. I am using a DVI - Thunderbolt(Mini DisplayPort) cable. (I tried HDMI&lt;-HDMI as well).  <answer269910> The MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Late 2013) has an Intel Iris 5100 GPU and is capable of supporting an HDMI-compatible device, including 4K, while using one Thunderbolt display strongor/strong it can support two Thunderbolt displays.  In terms of external resolution, this model supports up to 3840 x 2160 pixels at 30Hz or 4096 x 2160 pixels at 24Hz (using HDMI) or up to 3840 x 2160 pixels at 30Hz (using Thunderbolt).   According to the specs of the ACER R241Y, this has a maximum resolution of strong1920 x 1080 at 60Hz/strong. And, according to the user manual, this resolution is achieved using VESA mode.  strongPossible solutions/strong  ol liOn your MacBook Pro:  ul liemREFRESH RATE/em - As a first step I would check the Refresh Rate set in your MBP. You can find this under the Display tab within System Preferences  Displays. If you change it, you may need to wait a couple of minutes to ensure the change has taken effect properly./li liemRESOLUTION/em - I would also double-check you're not using the emScaled/em option for your resolution. Instead make sure you have the emBest for display/em option selected - also found in System Preferences  Displays./li liemRESET NVRAM/em - It may be worth resetting your NVRAM. If you're unsure how to do this, refer to my answer here. Make sure you look under the PRAM/NVRAM heading./li /ul/li /ol  NOTE: If at any point the display switches off after configuring options in your Displays System Preference, just press the kbdEsc/kbd key to undo the last change.  ol start="2" liOn your Acer R241Y display:/li /ol  If you're still having issues after checking/trying each of the above, try teh following:  ul liemMode type/em -  If your display is already in Auto mode, manually try each of the others (e.g. Standard mode, Graphic mode, etc) one by one. If it's already on a specifc mode, then try it in Auto mode instead./li liemFocus/em - You can also manually configure the display's focus. You should be able to do this by going to the Picture Menu./li liemReset your display/em - There should also be a Reset option on your display's menu. It may be worth trying this if all else fails./li /ul  strong[EDIT]/strong  Since your issue is around how fonts look, there is also a setting in your System Preferences  General. Maybe try ticking/unticking the emUse LCD font smoothing when available/em option to see what difference that makes.  <comment339000> What model Mac? What version of macOS? <comment339014> Your retina has a resolution of possibly 2880x1800 in a 15" screen. Your new monitor has a mere 1920x1090 on a much larger screen area. It's simply not capable of being as sharp as the retina. <comment339024> @Monomeeth El Capitan 10.11.6, MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Late 2013). <comment339025> @Tetsujin this would make sense if everything was blurry. Now we're specifically talking about the screen fonts. Specs say MBP Retina can drive up to 2 monitors, 2650x resolution. This is 1 monitor, 1920x resolution. <comment339027> Ok, so what mode are you using with the ACER R241Y (i.e. Dual Display Extended or Video Mirroring)? Or are you using the MBP in clamshell mode? <comment339029> Extended mode,no mirroring. <comment339184> Thank you for taking the time to write this, I had tried most of these steps before, especially looking at Display preferences (I Even experimented with installing an app that gives you access to custom resolutions and stuff). The resolution etc is correct. I think this is something with how OS/X handles font subpixel rendering. I was reading that "Sketch" had an option about that but they removed it.https://www.designernews.co/stories/64847-sketch-36 <comment339189> I am curious: What happens if you boot up in [Safe Mode](https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT201262), and if you use your MBP in [closed-clamshell](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201834) mode? <comment339236> will Sketch run in Safe mode? Let me try. I begin to think more and more this is how the fonts should look like. The crispiness of Retina just can't be mimicked on an ext monitor. <comment339320> Well, if trying Safe Mode (I meant without Sketch, but try both) and also closed-clamshell Mode makes no difference then I would agree. To be honest, I assumed you had a _blurriness_ issue rather than a _not quite as crisp_ issue. It's not that you can't achieve the same crispness on an external monitor, it's just that you can't on your monitor. There are many external monitors that will display as well as a Retina screen (you just have to pay for them). :) <comment339321> See screenshots in main question? I'm waiting tomorrow for a 27" monitor wqhd 2560x1440.. And will compare. Frankly I couldn't imagine there would be such difference between crispness. I thought it's about color fidelity, response times.. Here the problem looks much more serious to my eyes at least. (and after googling to many other eyes as well..) <comment339324> I've just edited my answer to include another option in System Preferences. Always worth a try. <comment339351> I tested all values of LCD font smoothing.. The weird thing is, changing it either with the menus, or with the terminal, makes absolutely no difference to my eyes <comment339377> Which monitor would you suggest actually to not have crispiness problems? <comment339531> To be honest, I would use your existing monitor for a while just to see whether it's still something that worries you after a couple of weeks of use. If it is, then you would need to look at a display capable of producing 3840 x 2160 pixels or 4096 x 2160 pixels, as that's what your MBP can support up to. Of course, you need to ensure it has a HDMI or Thunderbolt port capable of connecting to your MBP. Another factor to always consider is the quality of the cable (although many displays will include cables). <comment339552> Now I'm using a Dvi to mini display port (thunderbolt?) cable. Is that the same? <comment339757> update : received Asus 27" WQHD monitor. Tried DVI-mini DP cable : max is 1920 resolution. Tried HDMI cable : 2560x resolution achieved but monitor goes off after 2 seconds. Read that I need Display Port - Mini DP cable for max res. But definitely crispy. I might go for a 3840x one instead <comment339773> @GeorgeKatsanos Yes, if you're looking for something comparable to Retina then opting for a display capable of producing 3840 x 2160 pixels will meet your needs. As an aside, your internal display produces 2560 x 1600 to achieve the Retina effect on a 13" screen. <comment339802> Hm, the refresh rate is pretty low.. Won't I get 60hz from using the display port cable? <comment339807> Since you're now looking at other displays you should read this: [Using 4K displays, 5K displays, and Ultra HD TVs with your Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT206587). <comment339825> I'm reading this: https://support.apple.com/kb/sp691?locale=en_US . Dual display and video mirroring: Simultaneously supports full native resolution on the built-in display and up to 2560 by 1600 pixels on up to two external displays, both at millions of colors..  does this mean for 1 monitor it supports more? it's a bit unclear...
