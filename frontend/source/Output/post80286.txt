Updating to iOS 6.1 disables cellular FaceTime? <body> FaceTime over AT&amp;T's 4G (you know, 3G) on my iPhone 4s (with a 2GB data plan) was enabled as of a few days ago. Haven't checked the settings since then, but I just updated to iOS 6.1 from 6.0.1, and after a message came up about saying that the iPhone was now using the new iCloud email address for iMessages, I decided to check on FaceTime, and it appears that the cellular data option for FaceTime is switched off again (and I can't enable it, just shows the 'call AT&amp;T' popup). I don't really know for sure if I can blame iOS 6.1 because as its been a few days since I checked the setting it could be coincidence.  What do you think? A glitch in AT&amp;T's system that accidentally temporarily enabled my 4G FaceTime? Something about the update turning it off? When I asked AT&amp;T, they were surprised that it was even working at all a few days ago.  <answer80330> It isn't exactly iOS 6.1 and it sounds like AT&amp;T at it again. I updated my iPhone 4S to iOS 6.1 yesterday as well and my Facetime over Cellular is still enabled. I am on a shared data plan, though, which has always - since iOS 6.0 - had the option to Facetime over Cellular.   I think AT&amp;T's response when you asked them shows who is ultimately at fault here. Even though 6.1 isn't exactly at fault, it is possible that AT&amp;T hasn't fully opened the possibility to Facetime over cellular to users with data packages like yours, and that upgrading to iOS 6 somehow re-instated that until AT&amp;T does better opening it up.   <answer81326> According to AT&amp;T, before they officially began turning them on, some devices accidentally were switched on and then they turned them off, and that the actual rollout will be over a few months.  <comment92920> The same thing happens on an iPhone 5. Mine has a grandfathered unlimited plan that worked with FaceTime over LTE (this was a reason for purchasing the 5, in fact), but since upgrading (which changed my caller ID for iMessage and FT too) LTE FaceTime is disabled. <comment93164> Can anybody else confirm this or figure out a way to turn it back (like would changing caller ID settings work?)? <comment93184> you have to wait AT&T to update its cellular settings. <comment93193> Have you tried restoring? <comment93259> I have only tried disabling @icloud.com in FaceTime. I'd rather not go through the hassle unless someone else already knows that it would be a solution. <comment93572> Are you on an unlimited plan, or a tiered plan?  As of Jan. 16, those on unlimited plans are blocked from using FaceTime over cellular.  They just recently enabled it for tiered non-Mobile Share plans.  http://arstechnica.com/apple/2013/01/att-continues-chipping-at-facetime-over-cellular-policy/ <comment93617> @WarrenPena, they mentioned they are on the 2GB tiered data plan. <comment93748> Sorry, I missed that in AT&T's blog post they said it would take several months to roll out, but sure enough, it says that.  Source: http://blogs.att.net/consumerblog/story/a7786791  It still seems strange to me that it was enabled for you, and now it is not. <comment93751> So I contacted them again, and they said that before they officially began the rollout they accidentally turned it on for some people and then off. So, I guess that's just it. :( Gotta wait. <comment93752> I'm giving you the bounty since, well, you're the only one who I can give it to. And you were close. According to AT&T it wasn't the upgrade that triggered it, so I guess that was a coincidence, but that they accidentally turned it on, and then turned it off, before they "officially" started the "rollout". <comment93806> Thanks, @AL. When I saw the bounty on this question I started to look into it again. But I didn't get very far as I don't have access to a tiered data plan iPhone. If they haven't already got cellular FaceTime going, I hope they do quickly. Either way, I'm glad you got it figured out. <comment96956> Update: FaceTime over cellular has been re-enabled. Hopefully for good this time.
