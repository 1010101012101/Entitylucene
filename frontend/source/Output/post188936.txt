How can I get iTunes to redownload a deleted Podcast item? <body> This question is pretty much the same as How can I redownload an episode of podcast which I accidentaly deleted?. That old question had an answer,  although a comment says the answer is no longer relevant to later versions of iTunes. I'm not sure what the protocol is for this situation, but since I have the same problem today I thought I'd re-ask the question.  I am running iTunes v11.1.4.62 on Windows 7. I needed to reclaim some disk space so I manually deleted some of the downloaded podcast files from the iTunes folders.   How can I redownload that file via iTunes when I wish to listen to it again? The Podcast listing indicates that that file is already downloaded (i.e. there is no cloud icon to click on to initiate a download)  <answer188943> Try to let iTunes delete the podcast for you.br There should be three dots behind the podcast-name - click on them - delete download.br Probably it then will recognize that the podcast is already missing or deinstall it properly.  <answer239511> Press the three dots right next to the name when you select the Podcast row. Select (-) Delete. That will delete the row.  Then on the main Podcast, right-click and select "Refresh podcast". The row will re-appear with a little cloud next to it.  If the publisher has deleted the Podcast from their library, I guess you cannot recover it.  Hope that helps.  <comment223763> I cannot see an option like this. I can right click and choose to Delete, but that also deletes the entry from the podcast listing altogether. I cannot then redownload it later as it's totally removed from the list. <comment223764> Yes you can, search for it in the iTunes Podcast library or click on "show in iTunes store"
