Where is the temp folder? <body> I would like to know where is the folder of temporary files in system. For example, in Windows is the folder:  C:\Documents and Settings\Administrador\Configuraci√≥n local\Temp  <answer94974> code/tmp/code is the general location for temporary files in Mac OS X, as well as most UNIX-like systems.  <answer94981> Your question has a false premise that there IS a "temp" folder. This isn't Windows, and the Unix architecture of Mac OS X is entirely different. Temp folder for what? For some low level junk, there's code/tmp/code and code/var/tmp/code. For Application preferences there's code~/Library/Preferences/code, for Application caches and temp files, there's code~/Library/Application\ Support/code.  A clearer answer would be possible if you specified the particular task you're trying to accomplish.  <answer131080> OS X generates a programmatic directory stored in code/private/var/code and defines the $TMPDIR environment variable for locating the system temporary folder.  Using strongTerminal.app/strong, type codeecho $TMPDIR/code or codeopen $TMPDIR/code (to open Finder on that folder).  There you will find temp files stored by the Applications running.  Source: https://superuser.com/questions/581347/where-is-the-temp-folder-inos-x  Since OS X is based on UNIX, there are several types of temporary directories, in addition the the "system" one where it stores things.  ul li$TMPDIR which is generated like code/var/folders/xl/84p38nhj405frmrkdpqb3v9c0000gn/T//code/li licode/private/tmp/code/li licode/private/var/tmp/code /li licode/private/var/at/tmp/code/li licode/private/var/spool/cups/tmp/code/li /ul  <answer230531> The temporary directory for user specific temp files is given by the environment variable TMPDIR. This is under /var/tmp On my Yosemite login it is codeTMPDIR=/var/folders/11/d839g3h52m55ps0l8f621b8m0000gp/T//code  <comment111353> `launchd` and some other daemons use `/private/tmp/` and `/var/tmp` for temporary files and sockets. `/tmp` is a symlink to `/private/tmp`. <comment111354> Thanks friend! What is the difference between /private/tmp and /var/tmp?? <comment111356> As a general rule, `/tmp` is wiped upon reboot, while `/var/tmp` is not. <comment111358> There is also `$TMPDIR`. <comment111449> I think the OP is not trying to accomplish any task but rather wants to understand how OS X works. He's specifically asking for the equivalent of `%USERPROFILE%\Local Settings\Temp` (`%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Temp` on Vista and newer), not  `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Temporary Internet Files` or the like. That's probably `/tmp` (symlink to `/private/tmp`) and `/var/tmp`, the difference being that `/tmp` gets wiped clean at startup. I wouldn't say  `~/Library/Application Support` and `~/Library/Preferences` are temp folders as apps use them to save persistent data like state and settings. <comment111452> `$TMPDIR` is an environment *variable* that points to a temporary directory like `/tmp`, not a temporary directory itself. You can set `$TMPDIR` to any value you want (and it will work as long as the directory exists and has the sticky bit set). <comment281393> Are you saying that there ***isn't*** a temp folder?  Your answer would be refuted by this http://superuser.com/questions/581347/where-is-the-temp-folder-in-os-x  which also makes this question a duplicate. <comment282072> @Allan Did you at all read my post?
