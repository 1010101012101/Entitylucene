Can you change an MOV to an MP4 without transcoding? <body> How can change video container from .mov to .mp4 without touching the video itself? Preferably a GUI app.  I have a bunch of videos in .mov and since .mp4 is more widespread I want to use that, but I don't want to lose any quality.  <answer17729> You could do that with ffmpeg:  precodeffmpeg -i video.mov -vcodec copy -acodec copy video.mp4 /code/pre  This will just change containers, but obviously will only work with a codec that ffmpeg supports.  Edit: if you absolutely need a GUI, you could use Automator to create a Drag &amp; Drop target, like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WJpfn.png" alt="Automator"  <answer17742> QuickTime 7 Pro.br Again, only if it is in a codec allowed for MP4s.  <answer232918> It is also known as strongrewrapping/strong.   Open the file with MPEG Streamclip (freeware, adware-free) and choose codeFile/code  codeSave Asâ€¦/code, then choose the format: codeMP4/code.   <comment19387> Already know about this, looking for a simple GUI way of doing it. <comment19407> Frankly, it doesn't get any easier than this, but you can use Automator to create a Drag & Drop target. I've edited my answer to reflect that.
