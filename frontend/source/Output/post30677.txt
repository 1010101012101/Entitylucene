Mount XFS under Mac OS X Lion <body> I'm using Linux with XFS under Parallels. How I can mount a XFS in an efficient way? I use Transmit to mount guest filesystem as a disk, however performance is very poor.  <answer30922> what's about shared folders? I use them in good Read/Write speed.  <answer32768> I found solution that works for me and is really fast - http://macfusionapp.org/  <comment37448> Parallels support shredded folders under Windows only. <comment37471> ha! I've installed Ubuntu (PD7) and have Parallels Shared Folders worked! May be PD6 doesn't have this feature work properly <comment37472> Where can I checkout list of avaliable FS and or download them?
