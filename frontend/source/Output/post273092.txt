Could ._ files contain malicious software? <body> Doing clean install after mess up, put my image, video, music, text files to external hard drive (not time machine). I was checking them in Windows computer and found many files having copies that all started with " ._ "   Like image.png   was   ._image.png  None of them could be opened. I checked Internet and seems Mac just makes copies like that for system. https://apple.stackexchange.com/ques...rscore-files-created-and-how-can-i-avoid-them  But no where can I find answer:  1) could these files carry anything malicious for Mac?  2) Are they files that could run a code? Executable files?  3) Or are they same as any image file? As in risk of ._ files having anything bad in them being as low as risk of image/video/music/text files having anything bad in them?   4) If ._ file is copy of something actually malicious, will ._ also be malicious?  <answer273095> strongNo, these are not malicious files at all./strong In fact, they are actually just harmless and annoying. These are files that are hidden on the Mac, but will be visible on Windows because of the format of the external hard drive. "._" files are invisible resource fork segments of files.   When you are using NTFS or SMB, these files are not shown because the resource fork and original file are treated as one. You mentioned you were using Windows to view the drive, meaning you are most likely on exFat or FAT32. In these scenarios, expect many annoying files like these and on Macs, annoying trash folders. You might also notice files like .DS_STORE files, generally hidden on Macs, but shown on Windows.

So these weird files can't contain things that could be harmful-malicious for Mac? <comment343309> @Kannik In theory they could, but in practice, there's no reason to assume that they do. Just like a photo could contain malicious info, but probably doesn't. <comment343310> @Kannik Like JMY mentioned, there will most likely not be any malicious code in those files unless explicitly added. (If this helped you out, mark this as the best answer so that others may find it). <comment343352> @ Rushil Srivastava Thank you! Marked as best answer. I unfortunately lack 15 rep to vote it up. :( <comment343353> @JMY1000  Thank you! <comment343429> @Kannik No problem :)
