iOS application that allows search in Word documents? <body> I have a huge .doc (Microsoft Word) file (several megabytes) and I need to search it on my iPhone. I have tried like 5 different editors and readers to no avail.  Is there any application that allows searching in .doc files?  <answer66646> I have found an app for that. It is called QuickOffice, it costs 14.99$ and I had to break file into three to make it work. But the search is there and it works.  <answer92034> there's a program called "documents" in app store (its free) that lets you search for the word you want =]   <answer92427> Documents by Readdle is the app and it is very simple to use  <answer92431> The app "Documents" referred to above is a good option. It searches inside the documents whether the files are PDF, docx, etcâ€¦ It sports a clean interface and plenty of remote connection options. And not to mention, it's free with no ads!  Give it a go and see if it fits your needs.  <comment78487> Which specific apps have you tried already? And by doc you mean Microsoft Word I assume? <comment78491> Yes, microsoft word.
