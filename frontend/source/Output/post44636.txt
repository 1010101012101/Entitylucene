What's the startup/reboot time for iPad (3rd generation) compared to other iOS devices? <body> I'd like to know, in people's personal experience so far, about how long the new iPad takes to start up (in seconds), especially when compared with other devices running iOS.  For the purposes of uniformity, I'll define "startup time" as the time between the depression of the lock switch and the moment the lock screen appears.  <answer44637> iOS device boot times (timed using a second hand):  precodeiPad   (3rd gen.)   iOS5    32 seconds iPad 2 (2nd gen.)

Might be a good question to ask. <comment50772> [Done](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/44656/is-the-boot-time-of-an-ios-device-affected-by-the-apps-that-are-running-at-shutd) <comment50798> A note: since pressing the wake button and releasing it can introduce a time delay on the order of one or two seconds, it's best to time a start from plugging into power to kick the boot time in a more reproducible manner. <comment50893> @bmike What does plugging it in have to do with it?
