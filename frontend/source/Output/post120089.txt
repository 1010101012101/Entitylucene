Outlook 2011 Exchange Connectivity Issues <body> For the last few days I've been having issues with Outlook where it drop it's connecting to the exchange server and won't reconnect. It has been working fine for months now without any issues.  It doesn't seem to be a server issue as I can connect fine on Outlook 2010 in Parallels.  Any ideas as to what I can try to resolve this?  <comment140064> Did you install the last update? It might have broken it. <comment140067> I have had similar issues since upgrading to Mavericks...   Sending mails via exchange invariably gives the cannot connect message... retrying normally resolves it, but does mena that I send lots of double mails! <comment140491> @Robuust My current version is 14.3.9 which was released in November '13 and it's been working fine since then... <comment140493> @Joop I've been using Mavericks since it was released without any Outlook issues until a few days ago.
