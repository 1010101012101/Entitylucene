Numbers spreadsheet function to get last modified date of other cell <body> How can I create a cell that shows the last modified date of another cell in the same iWork Numbers spreadsheet? Is there a function for this?  The purpose is to make it clearer for the user of a spreadsheet when a certain value was last updated.  It could for example be a value that needs to be manually imported from outside, like a currency exchange rate. An important point of this is that maintaining the last modified date must be automated, so keeping track of if manually is not an option.
