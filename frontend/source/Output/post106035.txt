How can I use text to speech on an iPad? <body> I have an iPad 2 (MC979RS/A). Does this specific model have a text to speech feature?  I want to write in Russian and have the iPad read the text. I have tried finding this in the Settings, but couldn't find how to turn on this feature.  <comment124636> Do you have an iPad 1, 2, 3, or 4th gen? <comment124641> @Undo MC979RS/A is an iPad 2
