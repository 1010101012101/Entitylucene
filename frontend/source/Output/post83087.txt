On iphone sync, can I skip transfer of purchases from iphone to computer? <body> I really hate syncing my phone these days because whenever I do I have to wait for all the apps I've downloaded since last sync to transfer to the computer. I download a lot of apps  so this process takes emfor ever/em.  So: can I opt out of backing up my apps?  <answer83088> Yes. You can disable app syncing.  To do this:  ol liWith your device connected to iTunes select the "Apps" tab./li liUnder the app listing, strongdeselect/strong "Automatically sync new apps"./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NIxKd.png" alt="Sync new apps"  New apps will no longer sync with iTunes. They will still backup to iTunes or iCloud, however, so you have no need to fear losing them should your device information be lost.  emNote: all instructions provided work for iTunes 11./em  <answer178570> iTunes sucks. The only thing you can do is change the owner of the directory where the apps are stored to "root" and change the permissions. The apps are no longer copied, however it still takes time for iTunes to process all apps.  open terminal  precodecd ~/Music/iTunes/iTunes\ Media sudo chown root Mobile\ Applications sudo chmod 0700 Mobile\ Applications /code/pre  now iTunes no longer has access to the directory, so it cant copy the apps. You might get a warning, but you can ignore this.  <comment141537> iTunes 11.1.4 doesn't have this checkbox on the Apps tab. <comment165707> iTunes 11.3 also does not have this checkbox <comment165829> It appears that they have changed the wording to "Automatically *install* new apps". I confirmed this on iTunes 11.3.
