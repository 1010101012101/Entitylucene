Any way to remove all folders that contain only .DS_Store recursively? <body> If I try   precodesudo find . -name '.DS_Store' -delete /code/pre  then, within a few seconds, the code.DS_Store/code files get re-created by Finder before   precodesudo find . -type d -empty -delete /code/pre  can take effect.  I can do   precodesudo find . -name '.DS_Store' -delete; sudo find . -type d -empty -delete /code/pre  but this only works on small trees. If there are many subfolders, Finder starts recreating before the 2nd command runs.  <answer219002> Do you have Finder open to that folder? I don't see why the code.DS_Store/code folders would be recreated unless you were viewing them.  If the folders are truly empty, you should be able to use coderm -rf &lt;path&gt;/code. Be careful, it will completely remove that folder and any files in it. Do codeman rm/code to learn more.  emYou shouldn't need the codesudo/code unless you are touching system files. Don't do this unless you understand the ramifications./em  <comment264858> Could you please refine what you are trying to achieve? I can imagine you are doing some sort of development and want to avoid the .DS_Store files being in an archive/zip file... <comment264881> There is a reason for those files, what's yours to want to remove them? <comment264904> They are filling up a backup (made with CCC) and I don't need them in there. <comment264917> If they show up on your CCC backup, shouldn't they also be on your original drive? Which filesystem type did you format your backup drive to (HFS, FAT etc)?
