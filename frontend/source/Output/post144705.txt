how to switch to verbose output <body> Using Debian linux, I can switch to verbose output during shutdown and startup by pressing kbdF2/kbd.   I already know how to startup in verbose mode using kbdcmd/kbd + kbdV/kbd but I would like to switch to verbose mode from non-verbose mode.   Is there some way to do this using OSX snow leopard.  <answer144718> To boot into verbose mode use kbdCmd/kbdkbdV/kbd on boot up.
