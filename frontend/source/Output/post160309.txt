From Yosemite to Mavericks <body> I originally bought my Mac mini on Yosemite. I wanted to downgrade to mavericks, and on this website I read that if I went into core services and changed my SystemVersion.plist from 10.10 to 10.8 and download Mavericks from the AppStore, I would have mavericks. Guess what? App Store doesn't even work! All of my apple apps don't work because it says I need 10.10, including text edit. Can someone please help me? I even called apple and they didn't know what to do. HELP!!!!  <answer160322> Restart your MacMini to recovery mode by pressing kbdcmd/kbdkbdR/kbd at startup.    Open Utilities/Terminal in the menubar    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WKas3.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  emPlease replace "YourMainVolume" with the name of your main Mac volume (probably "Macintosh HD") in the following commands./em  If you made a backup of your codeSystemVersion.plist/code (like advised in my answer) enter:    precoderm "/Volumes/YourMainVolume/System/Library/CoreServices/SystemVersion.plist" /code/pre  and hit kbd↵/kbd, then enter:  precodemv "/Volumes/YourMainVolume/System/Library/CoreServices/SystemVersion.plist.backup" "/Volumes/YourMainVolume/System/Library/CoreServices/SystemVersion.plist" /code/pre  and hit kbd↵/kbd.br Enter codeexit/code, hit kbd↵/kbd, quit codeTerminal/code and restart your Mac.  If you didn't make a backup of your codeSystemVersion.plist/code enter:  precodevi "/Volumes/YourMainVolume/System/Library/CoreServices/SystemVersion.plist"     /code/pre  and revert the edits you made previously. (vi Quick reference)  Quit codeTerminal/code and restart your Mac.  <comment188454> You have Yosemite and wanted to downgrade to Yosemite - please edit the question to make it understandable <comment188463> @Helppppp Sorry to hear that. That was my [answer](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/159419/install-mavericks-on-second-partition-in-yosemite-only-system/159556#159556). But the question clearly states that the Mac (MacBook Pro 2012) **can** run Mavericks. My answer is not valid for Macs which only run with newer systems (like your MacMini) <comment211128> possible duplicate of [How do I downgrade from Yosemite 10.10 to Mavericks 10.9?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/153122/how-do-i-downgrade-from-yosemite-10-10-to-mavericks-10-9) <comment211137> @GrahamPerrin It's no duplicate. The title (it's not really a question) is misleading. It should be altered to: How do I recover my system install after trying to downgrade from Yosemite to Mavericks erroneously (following the instructions in this [answer](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/159419/install-mavericks-on-second-partition-in-yosemite-only-system/159556#159556))
