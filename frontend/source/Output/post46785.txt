Disk diagnostic and repair utility for Mac that works with all kinds of storage devices? <body> There are some nice and useful utilities for testing disks for bad blocks like MHDD, Victoria, HITACHI Drive Feature Tool etc. But these utilities have some limitations.  For example, MHDD is the best utility I've ever seen for both surface diagnostic and repair:  ul liit can sometimes fix sectors which were mistakingly marked as bad (soft "bad"s)/li liit finds other read errors (sectors with long read time for example)/li liit works with host protected area which used on some non Apple notebooks/li liit allows to erase whole disk or only areas with slow access time (which sometimes 'heals' them)/li liit allows to /li liduring surface scan it shows access time:/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uNw5J.jpg" alt="MHDD main screen"  But it has some serious issues:  ul liit's dos utility so it's tricky to use on Mac (but it's possible)/li liit may not work with Intel SATA controllers,/li liyou may need to put the HDD in an external enclosure to make the utility see that drive. /li lilatest version is dated 2006 and it's probably abandoned by author/li /ul  Please recommend a utility which can be used to repair and check a disk (HDD, SSD, flash drive, etc.), find bad blocks and other surface problems. Can your utility check the entire disk surface, including the system partition?  hr  Of course there are official warranty and authorized service centers, but software like this is always useful anyway (for example in a case of void warranty).  <answer46787> h1Drive Genius/h1  A personal favorite of mine, Drive Genius will do everything you're looking for with style. It's also used by the Apple Store folks, just so you know.  <answer46798> There's also   h2Alsoft Disk Warrior/h2  which can repair Mac OS disk directory corruption. It's often a useful "first step" before you go to something like Drive Genius.  <comment53973> Thanks. I found that even Demo can check drive for bad sectors.
