Is there a desktop pager for Mac OS Lion? <body> A desktop pager is a little program that sits in the corner or the dock, that allows me to switch desktops with a click, and drag windows between desktops.  Something like KDE had with kpager:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qvKAk.png" alt="KDE kpager"  Mission control is very nice, but it works better when you use a trackpad and not a mouse, and it can be quite an interruption. To move windows between desktops with key combos you need some acrobatics (click and hold titlebar, then kbdctrl/kbd+kbd⬅/kbd). With a pager, you could just fling the icon to a different desktop.  Is there a desktop pager for Mac OS (Lion)?   <answer61616> You can indeed use a mouse efficiently with Mission Control. Set any corner, preferably bottom, as the hot corner (System Preferences  Mission Control  Hot Corners) for Mission Control. After that, it’s just simple drag and drop, and you can switch apps and desktops in under a sec, or 2 secs with a file being dragged.  <answer61668> There is also a shareware, totalspace which I found gives you the closest experience to unix-like pager.
