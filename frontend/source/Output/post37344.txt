Is there an online resource with lots of iOS system icons? <body> By this, I mean the dock, the "X" button for app icons, the lock screen slider, etc.  Any file format is fine, but I'd like them to be at least the normal resolution.  <answer37347> http://graffletopia.com/categories/macintosh Looks like you'll need to get a demo copy of Omnigraffle to open them. Photoshop won't, and I'm not seeing other Mac standard software that will.  Also (Photoshop format):  http://www.teehanlax.com/downloads/  <comment42369> Awesome! As it happens, I already own OmniGraffle, so I should be all set. :) Thanks for the help!
