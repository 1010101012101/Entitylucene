Missing "Recently Deleted Photos" Album on iPhone 5S running iOS 8.4.1 <body> I accidentally deleted a number of photos on one of my iPhones (S5) which is running iOS 8.4.1. Unfortunately, it looks like the Photos app on that phone is missing the "Recently Deleted Photos" album. This phone has no Photo Stream or Photo Sharing switched on, and has not been backed up.   How can I get the Recently Deleted Photos album to show up?  On another note, my other phone which has a similar setup and is also running iOS 8.4.1, the Recently Deleted Photos album exists. There is also a search option in the album list which does not exist on the other phone. Does this mean the two photos apps on my two phones are different? How is it possible/how can I remedy this?
