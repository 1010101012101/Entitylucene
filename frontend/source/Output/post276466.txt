Changes to Touch ID warning after restarting iPhone due to unresponsive app <body> This morning I restarted my iPhone 7 due to an unresponsive app - Facebook, which does not use Touch ID. On restart I had to enter my passcode, which was to be expected after a reboot.   I then tried to view some banking apps, which require Touch ID, the first required my passcode, rather than Touch ID, I thought this was strange, but carried on. The second banking app showed a Touch ID error. Going back to the first app showed the error below.   I have not made any changes to Touch ID since setting up the phone months ago (at which point I filled all 5 slots for fingerprints), so am slightly concerned about this warning.   What could have caused this message? And what is the safest course of action?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SnZ8T.png" width="375"  <answer291304> This looks to be an issue with your bank's app. If I remember correctly, apps emare/em notified anytime a touchID change is made, so things like 1Password will request your Master Password to sign in. This popup seems to be of your bank's design, and a software glitch made your phone think there was a change in TouchID.  For future reference, you can confirm that all fingers enrolled in touchID are yours by going to strongSettings  Touch ID &amp; Passcode./strong Then scroll to the part of the pane where it shows your touchID fingerprints:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qwAYx.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Now, put each registered finger on the sensor and wait until the fingerprint is highlighted, like so:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SkjNb.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Ensure that each fingerprint is yours by making sure that your fingers highlight strongall/strong of the fingerprint options.  Or, you could just set touchID up again for all your fingers.  <comment348133> As far as I could tell, none of my fingerprints had been changed, all 5 still unlocked the iPhone, but I deleted them and changed them anyway. I got the same warning message, but expected it, as I had changed the fingerprints. <comment366833> Can you please update the question with your current iOS version, iOS version when you asked the question, and if the problem is still occuring? <comment366921> This only happened once.
