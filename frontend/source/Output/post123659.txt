Using cal command of Ubuntu <body> When I want to see a calendar on Ubuntu, I just command like this:  precode$ cal -3 /code/pre  Then, it displays prev/current/next month output.  But, the codecal/code command of OSX is a bit different from Ubuntu's, and there's no code-3/code option.  If I see the history section of man page, OSX's looks like this     A cal command appeared in Version 5 AT&amp;T UNIX. The ncal command appeared in FreeBSD 2.2.6.   And, the history section of Ubuntu's man page says     A cal command appeared in Version 6 AT&amp;T UNIX. Several much more elaborate versions of this program exist, with support for colors, holidays, birthdays, reminders and appointments, etc. For example, try the cal from http://home.sprynet.com/~cbagwell/projects.html or GNU gcal.   Can I use Ubuntu's codecal/code command on OSX?  <answer131998> I've been searching for codecal -3/code functionality on Mac as well.  From your quote, there's an alternative, GNU gcal, which is radically different from cal command. There's a tutorial that's easy to follow as well.  So I settled with it. You can type codegcal ./code for codecal -3/code equivalent.  <comment165086> Do you know why it shows calendar in a vertical format on some machine? <comment165204> I believe it's the locale stuff. `LC_ALL=ja_JP.UTF-8 gcal` gave me a vertical format. <comment165210> Yes, it was locale problem. Thank you! I don't know why the `gcal` show a vertical format in Korean locale. We don't use the vertical format. :(
