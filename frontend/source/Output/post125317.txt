How to reset iPhone to factory settings from computer if screen doesn't work? <body> I dropped the phone and the screen is not responding.  Before I take it to get it fixed I want to restore the iPhone to factory settings because I'm logged in on my apps, and I don't want the person fixing the phone to get access to my Facebook and other accounts.  I tried to turn it on again but the screen is not responding.

Simply visit the iCloud website, and follow the links for the Find My iPhone app. Once there, you have the option to lock your phone.  This means that the furthest anyone could get when replacing the screen is the unlock screen and that you don't have to go through the hassle of restoring from backups.
