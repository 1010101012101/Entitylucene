terminal custom commands source every time <body> After following this comment I added all my startup/alias commands to code~/.bashrc/code file and in code~/.bash_profile/code I added codesource ~/.bashrc/code   But still my aliases are not working. I have to manually source code~/.bash_profile/code overtime (with codesource ~/.bash_profile/code).  My .bashrc file:  precodealias km='cd /Users/apple/Desktop/km' /code/pre  and my .bash_profile file  precodeif which rbenv &gt; /dev/null; then eval "$(rbenv init -)"; fi source ~/.bashrc /code/pre  In my user directory I only have following files: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vmtP7.png" alt="enter image description here"  My iterm2 profile: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TUceJ.png" alt="enter image description here"  UPDATE: For me this solution actually worked  <answer221857> So after all struggle the only solution which worked for me is by executing codesource ~/.bashrc/code every time when I open my terminal.  <answer222231> I've gotten it to work by using .login and .profile. The way it works is .login is sourced by every login shell and  it in turn sources .profile  In .login I have:  precode. .profile /code/pre  and in .profile I have:  precodefunction pgrep(){ ps -axww | grep -i "$1" | grep -v "[p ]grep" }  function diskspc(){ sudo find / -iname "*$1*" -print0 | xargs -0 du -chs }   JAVA_HOME="/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.Framework/Versions/1.5.0/Home" export JAVA_HOME  alias rsync="rsync --stats --progress"  alias forcequit="open -a iForce\ Quit"  alias ls="/bin/ls -FG" alias ll="ls -la" alias gls="gls --color=auto -aF"  alias find="/usr/bin/find"  . /sw/bin/init.sh  LC_ALL='C' export LC_ALL  alias locate2='if [ $((`date +%s`-`eval $(stat -s /var/db/locate.database); echo $st_mtime`)) -gt 3600 ]; then echo "locate: db is too old!"&gt;/dev/stderr; sudo /usr/libexec/locate.updatedb; fi; locate -i'  alias flocate="/sw/bin/locate.fink --database=/sw/var/locatedb"  LOCATE_PATH=/var/db/locate.database #LOCATE_PATH=/sw/var/locatedb:/var/db/locate.database #LOCATE_PATH=/sw/var/locatedb export LOCATE_PATH  #LESS_IS_MORE=1 #export LESS_IS_MORE /code/pre  Of course,feel free to use or not the stuff in my .profile.  <comment268126> is your terminal configured to launch a **login** shell? <comment268201> Yes I guess its using login shell. Please check screenshot attached above <comment268224> Try running Terminal, the built in one not iTerm. Does it load your alias? <comment268233> no it didnt work :( <comment268677> If you solved your problem, please post an answer and accept it. Make sure you include proper acknowledgement of the original author, a link, and the most important information from said post. This helps future users by allowing them to easily see that the problem is solved even if they miss the last line. <comment268684> Are you using Bash or ZSH? You have ZSH configuration files in your $HOME. If you are using ZSH then this would explain why your Bash aliases, etc, aren't being read. Double check by opening an iTerm/Terminal window and typing `echo $SHELL` <comment268698> its ZSH How do I fix it?
