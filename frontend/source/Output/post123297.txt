Mavericks won't update. Crash on boot software update <body> I believe the update process was interrupted once. My computer works fine but the strongSoftwareUpdateLauncher/strong fails to do anything on shutdown when I am logged out. I can see that it is in the application strongSoftwareUpdateLauncher/strong but nothing happens, I've let it sit for over an hour before.

On the grey screen with softwareupdatelauncher just hit enter.   <comment144030> Unfortunately, that didn't work :(
