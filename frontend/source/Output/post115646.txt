How can I create a symbolic link in Terminal? <body> What command is used to create a symbolic link/soft link?  <answer115647> precode┌── ln(1) link, ln -- make links │   ┌── Create a symbolic link. │   │                         ┌── the path to the intended symlink │   │                         │   can use . or ~ or other relative paths │   │                   ┌─────┴────────┐ ln -s /path/to/original /path/to/symlink       └───────┬───────┘               └── the path to the original file/folder                   can use . or ~ or other relative paths /code/pre    precode$ echo content &gt; original $ ln -s original symlink $ ls -la original symlink -rw-r--r--  1 grgarside  staff    8 28 Jan 18:44 original lrwxr-xr-x  1 grgarside  staff    8 28 Jan 18:44 symlink -&gt; original $ cat symlink content /code/pre  For more information about ln(1) see the man page.  To create a symlink to replace a system directory (e.g. if you want to have code/Users/code pointing to another disk drive), you need to disable System Integrity Protection. You can re-enable it after the symlink is set up.  <answer115648> The command is called codeln/code. If used with the option code-s/code it will create a symbolic link in the current directory:  precodeln -s /any/file/on/the/disk linked-file /code/pre  <answer236394> I know this question is explicitly asking about the Terminal, but if you're in GUI Land and don't want to enter Terminal Land, you can use SymbolicLinker. This puts a "Make Symbolic Link" option in your Services menu in Finder.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Hi1s9.png" alt="A context menu for a folder, showing a &quot;Services&quot; submenu, with &quot;Make Symbolic Link&quot; hilighted"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9lqeT.png" alt="A context menu for a symbolic link, with &quot;Make Symbolic Link&quot; hilighted"  <answer236403> It's just codeln -s &lt;source&gt; &lt;destination&gt;/code.  <comment273185> If only man pages were as clear as your answer! <comment281880> permission denied :S can you give me a hint? trying to create symlink for Users so I can use it on other hard disk and ssd has just symlink. thanks <comment281881> @Ewoks /Users is protected by SIP. You can [disable System Integrity Protection](https://georgegarside.com/blog/osx/package-incompatible-installer/) to set up the symlink (and re-enable it after if you wish). I've added this to the answer. <comment281887> You don't need to disable SIP to symlink SIP-protected folders/files, e.g. `ln -s /Users /Users/myuser/all-users` works perfectly. You only need to disable SIP if you want to create the symlink *in* a SIP-protected folder (as you would if you wanted to create any other directory entry there). <comment281927> @patrix I interpreted the comment as wishing to replace /Users with a symlink rather than creating a symlink pointing *to* /Users — is this not what was intended? <comment281928> @grgarside That's how I understand Ewoks as well. But that's not how I read your edit to the answer. <comment281934> @patrix I've edited my answer to clarify; feel free to edit further. <comment289295> Welcome to Ask Different!  While you answer is technically correct, we are looking for more than just a simple one line answer.  Further explanation or examples is helpful to other users. <comment289327> I'd love to know why this was downvoted so I can make higher-quality answers from now on :) <comment289583> probably because the question was "How can I create a symbolic link in Terminal?" But I am not downvoting you :) <comment290569> Sometimes a quick, simple answer is exactly what's needed. Detailed answers are great, but not when you're just looking for a quick syntax check. <comment291663> Fun fact: **original** doesn't need to actually exist. The command `ln -s "This directory is no longer in use" README` would be perfectly legitimate, and then anybody executing `ls -l` would see the message. <comment291664> Does this imply that there's simply no way to do this from the Mac Gui *without* installing software? Also, I can't help thinking that this could have been done with Automator. <comment291666> @EdwardFalk as far as I know, there isn't. I was hoping, like windows, dragging while holding `Alt` or `Shift` or something would do it, but nope! <comment321264> I'm with @ThomasHigginbotham. <comment323562> Does the linked-file have to exist first? I get a file not found error on the target. <comment323593> The file not (you get an error message if it does), but all directories in any path. If you are stuck, feel free to ask a new question using the Ask Question button at the top right. Include a link to this question to provide context. <comment326127> @EdwardFalk I think in El Capitan, you can hold `Command`+`Option` while dragging a file... will update the answer later <comment334404> @BenLeggiero That makes an alias. <comment334535> @AndyStewart What's the difference? <comment344928> @BenLeggerio, The difference is explained here: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2991/whats-the-difference-between-alias-and-link <comment344934> @MiB thanks! I guess that means my main answer needs no update :) <comment357392> For future reference: You don't need to move /Users on macOS to save space. You can change users' home directory paths individually in the System Preferences under Users & Groups by right-clicking the user list entries. <comment359994> I always created broken symlinks while trying `ln -s ./original/source/ ../path/to/symlink` so the `.` operator really messed things up for me using the entire path with `~` fixed it.
