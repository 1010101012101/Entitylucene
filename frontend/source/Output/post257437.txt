Removing plist file when "operation not permitted" prevents it <body> Warning: strongI am a mac newbie/strong. I am a Windows developer so my challenges stem from Mac being different from "my normal."  Short version: I want to do what is recommended here but when I try to delete the .plist file for the macbookpro I get "Operation not permitted."  For reference, the file I am trying to delete (to get my CPU back when running on battery) is:      /System/Library/Extensions/IOPlatformPluginFamily.kext/Contents/PlugIns/ACPI_SMC_PlatformPlugin.kext/Contents/Resources/MacBookPro8_1.plist   Longer version: This is actually my brother-in-law's computer and I remember doing this same thing a few years ago and it worked fine. However, it seems he has updated his system to 10.12 (Sierra?) and Apple has made a change preventing the previous fix from actually working.  I fell like I have read a lot and have tried modifying the file permissions for the .plist file in question but I now think the problem is not with permissions on the .plist file but perhaps with permissions on a parent directory.  A few challenges, I don't really get the whole unix-style permissions thing (drwxr-- etc.) or how hierarchy is at play or how to easily cascade changes down a directory tree. I'm not even sure if these are issues in my case.  I copied the parent .kext file to the desktop, then I could remove the .plist file but now I cannot seem to copy the .kext file back to overwrite the original.  In the end, I just want to remove this .plist file like I did some years ago and even as root I cannot do it now.  I would greatly appreciate any insights.  <comment321433> @fsb Thanks a million for that link. That was EXACTLY what I needed. As a Mac newbie, I would NEVER think to search for "What is the 'rootless' feature..." I would recommend curating a better question title, for example one that focuses on the symptom as that is what most people will be searching for.
