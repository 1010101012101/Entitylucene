Script to raise a single window to the front <body> In a script I'm trying to find the Terminal.app window containing a specific tty device and raise that window to the top. Here's what I have in Applescript so far:  precodetell application "System Events"   set foundWin to false   if (name of processes) contains "Terminal" then     tell application "Terminal"       set theTabs to first tab of every window where tty is "$(tty)"       repeat with theTab in theTabs         if class of theTab is tab then           set theWin to (first window whose tabs contains theTab)           set selected tab of theWin to theTab           set foundWin to true         end if       end repeat     end tell   end if   if foundWin then     --RAISE THE WINDOW?!   end if end tell /code/pre  Where I'm getting stuck is the "raising the window" part.  Here are some things that are not quite what I want:  codeset frontmost of theWin to true/code -- this brings the window to the front of the group of Terminal.app windows but doesn't raise it above any other windows.  codetell application "Terminal" to activate/code -- this brings every Terminal window to the front in a big stack. I just want the one window.  precodetell application "System Events"     set theSysWin to first window of process "Terminal" whose name is (name of theWin)     perform action "AXRaise" of theSysWin end tell /code/pre  This almost does it, but what it does is to raise the terminal window to the #2 position, still underneath the active window (if the active app is something other than Terminal.app.)  codeclick theSysWin at {10,50}/code -- doesn't seem to do anything.  codeclick first static text of theSysWin/code -- doesn't seem to do anything.  Is there a way to do this? It doesn't have to be in Applescript.  EDIT I did find this web page ( http://blog.coriolis.ch/2008/03/04/bring-any-window-to-the-front/ ) quoting an Obj-C/Cocoa call:  codeSetFrontProcessWithOptions(&amp;psn, kSetFrontProcessFrontWindowOnly);/code  I'm not familiar with either ObjC or Cocoa, and this is (ultimately) getting invoked from a shell script, so not sure where to go from there.  <answer39216> codeopen/code only raises a single window:  precodedo shell script "open -a Terminal" /code/pre  Another way to raise a window is to set its index to 1 and then use AXRaise:  precodetell application "Terminal"     set index of window 2 to 1 end tell tell application "System Events" to tell process "Terminal"     perform action "AXRaise" of window 1 end tell /code/pre  <answer45554> You can click menu items of applications that aren't active. Use it to click the menu item corresponding to the window in the emWindow/em menu.  This is what you need to insert in your script:  precodetell application "System Events"     tell application process "Terminal"         click menu item (name of theWin) of menu of menu bar item "Window" of menu bar 1     end tell end tell /code/pre  While it doesn't activate the program, the window is frontmost.  <answer93494> I realize this thread is quite old, but I ran across it while fighting the same problem and others may as well.  As far as I can tell it cannot be done in raw AppleScript.  It can be done in AppleScriptObjC however.  To use the example from @Daniel Beck, the new version would be like this.  precodeproperty NSWorkspace : class "NSWorkspace" set workspace to NSWorkspace's sharedWorkspace() tell application "System Events"     tell application process "Terminal"         click menu item (name of theWin) of menu of menu bar item "Window" of menu bar 1         workspace's launchApplication_("Terminal")     end tell end tell /code/pre  The added code will use the Cocoa class NSWorkspace to "launch" the application, which raises only the frontmost window of that application to the front with focus.  For more detail on the process that brought me to this, I have a more thorough writeup on my website here.  <comment44372> I mean, *clicking* on the window has the desired effect. So not sure why it would be impossible programatically. I did find this web page ( http://blog.coriolis.ch/2008/03/04/bring-any-window-to-the-front/ ) with Obj-C/Cocoa call:  `SetFrontProcessWithOptions(&psn, kSetFrontProcessFrontWindowOnly);`  I'm not familiar enough with either objc or cocoa to know where to go from there though. <comment58360> Almost! It raises the window above all other windows EXCEPT the topmost window of the active application. So if I've got a web browser maximized or something, it doesn't have a visible effect :/
