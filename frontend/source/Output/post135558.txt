Can't backup iphone to icloud <body> My iphone hasn't backed up to icloud in over 19 weeks. I have deleted hundreds of pictures, turned off Mail, Reminders, Safari, Notes, and Passbook and still it says there is no room.  The only thing that is on to backup is calendar and contacts.  Can this be right?   <answer135561> Please check the iCloud tab on your iPhone, you can see the details there and remove stuff you don't want anymore.  ol liSettings/li liiCloud/li liJust above strongDelete account/strong click strongstorage and backup/strong (this is probably named different)/li liClick strongmanage storage/strong/li liYou can manage your data here and check what's taking up the space./li /ol  <comment160659> Do you have any apps taking up a lot of space or other devices?
