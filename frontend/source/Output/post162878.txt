Responsive icon solution when changing icon sizes in OS X Finder <body> I rarely use the Finder outside of list view, but sometimes I need to view a large folder of images to select from. By default, the icons/image previews are not large enough for my needs, so I increase the size of the thumbnail icons in the bottom right of the finder window to determine which image to use. Easy peasy.  When I do this, however, the icons don't cascade down. Instead, I get a scrollbar with icons out of view to the right. This is so Windows 2000.   My solution is to go to codeView &gt; Clean Up By &gt; Name/code and all icons are shown with only up and down scrolling and are the size I want.  Is there some way I can have it so when I increase icon preview size in the Finder, that all images stay inline?   I don't need to set a default size for all icons to load. I prefer the default size for most use cases, aside from this one.   See below for an example showing my workflow issue.  tl;dr I want responsive design applied to my finder icons!  img src="https://i.imgur.com/hcaZWlX.gif" alt="responsive finder workflow"  <answer162884> You can have the folder contents auto-arranged in icon view via a few settings in codeView &gt; Show View Options/code (kbdâŒ˜ Cmd/kbd-kbdJ/kbd).  When you select the files to be codeArranged By/code the criteria you prefer and select codeUse as Defaults/code, the icons are automatically re-organised on-the-fly. Note that you don't need to select codeAlways open in icon view/code, as in the example image below.  These default settings will be used for all folder that don't have folder-specific settings applied, before or after setting the defaults.  You have to restart Finder, e.g. by codekillall Finder/code before the new defaults are used.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uJhz8.png" alt="example of folder settings"br sup(Image borrowed from a SuperUser answer)/sup
