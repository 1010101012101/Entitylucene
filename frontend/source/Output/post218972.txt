Time Machine Partition gone from external hard drive, can't repartition <body> I've got a 1TB external drive which used to have two partitions: One formatted in NTFS to share files between Mac and Windows, and one for Time Machine Backups.  I haven't used it in quite some time. In the mean time, I've upgraded to the latest OS version. When I just plugged it in, Finder only mounts the NTFS partition. Disk utility doesn't seem to find the Mac partition, either:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3iAfp.png" alt="enter image description here" Disk Drill can find the unallocated disk space, but I can't seem to partition it:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OKdEu.png" alt="enter image description here"  Running codediskutil list/code yields this output:  precode  /dev/disk0 (internal, physical):      #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER      0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *251.0 GB   disk0      1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1      2:          Apple_CoreStorage Macintosh HD            250.1 GB   disk0s2      3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3   /dev/disk1 (internal, virtual):      #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER      0:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD           +249.8 GB   disk1                                    Logical Volume on disk0s2                                    8D669AB9-1E90-4E1C-863F-7366AB64BFE1                                    Unlocked Encrypted   /dev/disk2 (disk image):      #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER      0:     Apple_partition_scheme                        +17.5 MB    disk2      1:        Apple_partition_map                         32.3 KB    disk2s1      2:                  Apple_HFS Flash Player            17.4 MB    disk2s2   /dev/disk3 (external, physical):      #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER      0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk3      1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk3s1      2:       Microsoft Basic Data SHARE                   580.6 GB   disk3s2 /code/pre  I'd like to avoid reformatting the entire drive, if possible. How can I recover my partition, or create a new one?
