conditional formatting based on other cell text and the target cell value <body> I'm trying to do conditional formatting on Excel. I need to use two values:  ol liText from column A : "soft" or "hard"/li litarget column B: numbers/li /ol  what I need to do is if the number in the target column is more than 5 and the text in column A is "soft", make the target column red. If the number in target column is more than 8 and the text in column A is "hard", make the target colon yellow.  How can I do it?  <comment315392> Which version of Office for Mac are you using here?
