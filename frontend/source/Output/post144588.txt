extend the press and hold app to other keys <body> Thanks to this question: Customize accents when holding down a key  I know understand how to customise the press and hold app a bit to letters. But I'm wondering, could I do the same trick for other keys. For example if press the  (shift + .) I would like to get a pop up where I can choose to select → or ≥. Would that be possible ?  <answer145031> Okay, I think it is not possible, therefore I've made this little html app, that mimics the OSX app:  https://openuserjs.org/libs/kasperpeulen/pressandhold  You can find a demo here:http://embed.plnkr.co/jNA28BBb2JFAccPPX61p/preview  <comment268852> Did you ever find a solution for this? I'm also hoping to extend press and hold to characters other than letters.Specifically the ? key to get ¿. This is standard behavior on the iphone, but oddly enough it's not consistent on Mac OSX El Capitan.
