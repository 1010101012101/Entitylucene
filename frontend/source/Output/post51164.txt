Sum of all processes' real memory not equal to used memory? <body> I wonder why the sum of all processes' real memory listed in codeActivity Monitor/code is not equal to (MUCH less than) the used memory?  <comment58528> Used memory is the sum of Wired + Active + Inactive. I think (but am not certain) that the sum of the real memory would be equal to Active + Inactive. <comment59134> That's strange, on my mac about 1.5gb of ram is unaccounted for lol
