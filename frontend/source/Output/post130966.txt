Want to Update OpenSSL with Ruby 2.0.0 Already Installed <body> I have Ruby 2.0.0-p451 installed via RVM. From what I have read online the newer versions of openssl need Ruby 2 installed.  I'm running RVM 1.25.25.  I currently host Ruby on Rails websites on my Mac Mini Server running Mavericks and OS X Server 3.1.1.  I'm not currently using openssl but would like to upgrade it in light of the Heartbleed security vulnerability reported over a month ago.  I am not using SSL in any of my websites.  When I get ready to I may use openssl or Common Crypto.  I would like both of them to be current when I make my decision.  I have searched online and noticed there were problems with people that updated openssl without running Ruby 2.0.0.  I have not found any issues with updating openssl after Ruby 2 was installed.  I want to know the best way to upgrade openssl.  I do not use Homebrew or Macports.  However I believe that when I upgraded Ruby on Rails to 4.0.0 it installed/updated Macports on my server.  I have found the steps below on how to install it in the Terminal if you do not want to use RVM or Homebrew.  This post was written in March 2013  precodecd Downloads/ cd openssl-1.0.1e/ ./Configure darwin64-x86_64-cc make sudo make install /code/pre  Since I'm using RVM I need to know how to upgrade it and not mess up Ruby.  I'm open to use Macports but I need to know the command.  I would also like to know which version I should install (MD5, SHA, PGP sign, normal).  Any help would be appreciated.  <comment153820> Why do you think Ruby on Rails installed Macports - this seems highly unlikely as RoR is pure ruby and uses Ruby Gems? <comment153834> Ruby on Rails now checks to see what is needed in the background to help it work.  It will install what is missing on your system.  It's been a while since I upgraded from version 3 to 4 but I believe that happened.  Unfortunately I do not know how to check for it to see if it is in my system.
