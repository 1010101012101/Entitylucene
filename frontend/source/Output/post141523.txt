Moving files from bad external harddrive <body> I use OSX mavericks. My external 1TB harddrive is partially unreadable. I want to salvage its content as much as possible. I have tried codedd/code but it took almost a day, so I killed it, and it could not resume from where it left when I rerun it. I am currently trying moving folders one by one with Finder.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GocUJ.png" alt="Moving folders"  My question is there any option in Finder to continue moving even if errors are detected ?  <answer141525> Finder will always halt on Error.  Have you tried Data Rescue 3? I've had good results using that in the past. http://www.prosofteng.com/products/data_rescue.php  <comment166795> Which question? @patrix <comment166796> Look at the top of your question, the link is displayed there. Also it might help to search for "getting data from a failing disc" and similar search terms here on the site, the issue has come up before. And just a personal observation: If the drive is failing, it will do more harm than good to run several copy processes in parallel.
