How do I back up videos using IFTTT, not just photos <body> I created an IFTTT applet to backup photos from my camera roll to Google Drive, which is syncing to my Mac. I created a folder action to move all files from that Google Drive folder(code~/Google Drive/IFTTT/code) to code~/Pictures/IFTTT/code. The photos backup fine, but the videos aren't even detected by IFTTT.  How can I get IFTTT to backup all my photos and videos or is there an alternative to back up my videos?  <comment371563> This seems to be a limitation with IFTTT.
