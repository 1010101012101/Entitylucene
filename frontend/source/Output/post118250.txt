Slow login on OS X Mavericks <body> The login time period (the period of time between the password is entered and the dock is shown on the desktop) is extremely slow (~3 minutes). After the system is up it behaves normally.  How can I trace what login item(s) may slow the login process down?  Gil  <answer118350> Check your Login Items  ol liOpen System Preferences/li liClick on Users and Groups/li liClick on the Login Items tab/li liRemove any entries in there that you don't recognize or don't need/li /ol  <answer118357> What are your system specs? Are there multiple users that login into this machine regularly or attached to network?  Else, you could try backing up via timemachine and adding a Solid State Drive. Boot times are amazing.   <answer118401> Note the time when you enter your password to login.  Once logged in, run the strongConsole/strong application from code/Applications/Utilities/code and look at the strongAll messages/strong log. Look back to the time you entered your password and what messages appear between then and now.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/onB1d.png" alt=""  Anything seem suspicious? Any entries citing errors connecting to a network share, internet resource, etc?  <comment138124> Do this **very** carefully. <comment138258> only one user and the system does have SSD installed. After the slow login it runs quite fast.
