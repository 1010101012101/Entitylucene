Offline installation of El Capitan from a Windows machine? <body> My macbook pro OS X is broken behind repair and I need to re-install the OS X. Unfortunately it seems the online installation is not working, because it stops downloading about half way through and never completes.  In any case, I only have access to Windows machines. Is there any way to create a USB bootable drive to install El Capitan on my macbook pro 13' (late 2014)?   Any other way to do an offline installation?  <answer233426> If there is an Apple Store near you, you can go in and they will allow you to download the installer.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RwtwX.png" alt="enter image description here"  You may also be able to find someone who can create the installer for you.  <comment285282> You might also want to check ebay.....just sayin'
