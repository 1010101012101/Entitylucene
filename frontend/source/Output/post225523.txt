PPT Mac: Any way to easily remove animations from a slide? <body> I inherited a slide deck full of builds and animations which I don't use. The only way I found to remove animations from a slide is:  ol liClick on the "animations" tab/li liClick on the "Animation Properties" (or whatever its called) button/li liSelect all the animations listed/li liClick the delete  button/li /ol  For example I can't find a shortcut to display the animations properties window, so just that is two clicks. Anything to make it quicker?
