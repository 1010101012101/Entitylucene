Is there a way to execute on applescript when a server becomes available? <body> I am trying to execute a script when a server becomes available (a bit like when the OS detect the presence of a time capsule device and it starts the backup.)  I didn't find a simple way to attach an applescript to an system event. Is there a way?  I am not looking for anything that requires a compiler. I am simply looking at attaching to an OS event (a bit like "Folder Actions" I guess, but for a server.)  <answer16261> You can use launchd for that purpose. Here is an example of a launchd config plist that will execute an AppleScript when a disk is mounted:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt;     &lt;dict&gt;         &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;string&gt;Example&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;array&gt;             &lt;string&gt;/usr/bin/osascript&lt;/string&gt;             &lt;string&gt;/Users/sakra/Documents/Test.applescript&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;/array&gt;         &lt;key&gt;StartOnMount&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;true/&gt;     &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  To activate the config plist save it to the LaunchAgents folder in your Library folder as codeExample.plist/code.  From the Terminal you can then use the command codelaunchctl/code to activate codeExample.plist/code by running:  precodelaunchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/Example.plist /code/pre  The AppleScript will then be run each time a filesystem is mounted.  To deactivate it, run:  precodelaunchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/Example.plist /code/pre  <answer16262> The only way I can think of is run an script with an codeidle/code handler that periodically checks to see if the server is available and if so executes another script or another portion of the same script.  <comment17762> I guess this answers my question partially. The StartOnMount option specifies the script to run when a disk is mounted. What I really want is my script to launch when a server is available on the network. I will look into launchd's man pages see if there is anything I can use. <comment17764> [Cross-posted to SU.](http://superuser.com/questions/299970/is-there-a-way-to-execute-on-applescript-when-a-server-becomes-available) <comment18411> since i didn't get any better answer, this is a work around I will accept as an answer.
