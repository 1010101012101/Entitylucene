Show hidden files when searching in finder <body> I can see hidden files in Finder but when I search it doesn't find hidden files.  I have tried everything.  precodedefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE killall Finder /code/pre  I also change "File visibility" to "Invisible Items" when searching.  Please help somebody as it drives me mad how Apple makes it difficult to change.  <answer82295> There is a way to search also within hidden files:   ol liOpen Finder/li liFill search box with searched text/li liClick "+" button./li liChoose "File visibility" and your option. /li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dnybo.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer125215> Do as maseth says, but instead of "File visibility" you want "System files".  Or rather, do both to be able to search everything.  <answer289157> Sadly, I never found a solution to this either. According to LifeHacker there is actually no way to do it except using comercial software. So the only other possible answer your question is 'use the Terminal'   ol liOpen a terminal/li liEnter this command:   codecd &lt;your_directory_of_interest&gt;/code/li liFind the files with a name starting with a 'dot'.  codefind . -name ".*"/code/li liYou can redirect the resulting list to a textfile by adding code&gt; textfilename/code to the last command. Then use that file to do whatever you need to do with the files. /li /ol  <comment95234> Unfortunately it does not work. I have tried that before. <comment146543> This does not work either in my tests
