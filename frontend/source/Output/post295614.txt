macOS partition not working <body> I had partitioned my MacBook into macOS and Windows when I bought the laptop. I gave my laptop to get the fans and keyboard replaced. It was working fine for two days until I rebooted it. The startup chime is heard and the Apple logo with the progress bar shows up, but 3/4th along the way the laptop shuts down.   I was able to access my Windows partition though and had tried several ways to restore only the Mac side including performing Safe Boot (kbdShift/kbd kbdCmd/kbd kbdV/kbd), resetting NVRAM and using Recovery Disk which showed a leaf count error and I had no idea to fix this.   Was there a way to fix this without losing all my data on the macOS partition?  <comment373318> Can you post the *actual* error message?   Also be sure to update your question with your MacBook model and version of macOS.  Also, what is the output when you boot in Verbose Mode (hold Cmd-V while until the startup chime) You may need a camera to capture the output <comment373616> I had since fully formatted my macOS side but the actual message that showed up was something along the lines of having my leaf count as 4018 when it should actually be 4017. After going to the recovery disk, First Aid had failed and showed the same error message. I wanted to know if there was anything else I could've done.
