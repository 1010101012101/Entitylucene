Where to submit ticket about printing PDF issue <body> I was not able to print a password-protected PDF with Preview even though I have the password.   But I'm able to print with Adobe Acrobat Reader  Where is Apple's bug tracker to submit issue?  <answer116179> File bugs at https://bugreport.apple.com  Start with https://developer.apple.com/programs/which-program/ and at the bottom of the page is a free option to start up a developer account (which will need an  AppleID) you want to use for bug reporting.  Lastly, check out QuickRadar and http://openradar.appspot.com/ if you want others to see your bug report.
