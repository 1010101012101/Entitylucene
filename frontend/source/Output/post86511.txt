Thread count of process x? <body> My AppleScript needs to get thread count of process x.  I have tried many ps etc codes but all these are not working for some reason.  I tried these:  precodedo shell script "ps uH p 301 | wc -l" --&gt;"       0" do shell script "ps axo pid,ppid,rss,vsz,nlwp,cmd" --&gt; error "ps: nlwp: keyword not found /code/pre  <answer86521> codeps/code on OS X takes different options than codeps/code on Linux. Please have a look at codeman ps/code to see the detailed list of supported keywords. For threads I found the following (but I don't know whether this is the information you are looking for):  precode wq         total number of workqueue threads  wqb        number of blocked workqueue threads  wqr        number of running workqueue threads /code/pre  PS: I would recommend to first test any unix level commands in Terminal/bash and only move to AppleScript once they are working as expected. You are far more flexible in bash and also may get better/more helpful error messages back.  <answer86522> codeps -M PID | grep -v USER | wc -l/code will give the thread count. Replace codePID/code with the process ID of the process in question. The code-M/code option prints one line per thread of the process, then codegrep/code strips out the header line, and codewc -l/code gives the count.  The AppleScript will end up being something like codedo shell script "ps -M " &amp; process_id &amp; " | grep -v USER | wc -l"/code, where codeprocess_id/code is an AppleScript variable.  <comment99989> There seems to be a distinction between "workqueue" threads and threads as reported by Activity monitor. For example, Chrome reports 31 threads in Activity monitor, but `ps` reports 1, 1 and 0 for `wq`, `wqb` and `wqr` respectively.
