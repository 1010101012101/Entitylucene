Unable to load contents of huge folder on external HD <body> I have a NTFS-formatted external drive. The root directory contains the folders codeDocuments/code, codeMusic/code, etc. The codeDocuments/code folder has only a couple of files in it, and loads fine in Finder. My Music folder, on the other hand, has a total of like 12k .mp3s, some in the folder, and some in subdirectories (there are a lot) of the music folder. When I try to open the folder, it doesn't load anything inside the folder. codels/codeing the folder in Terminal also shows nothing. What might be wrong here/how can I access the contents of the folder?  <comment329375> Broken INDX records in the MFT.
