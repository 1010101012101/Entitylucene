Xcode and installing GLEW for OpenGL <body> Right now, I am having trouble installing GLEW on my MacBook Pro (MAC OSX 10.6.8) for OpenGL projects.  I have attempted to install GLEW multiple times so I do not get "no directory error", but without success. The problem is that the GLEW library is stored in the /usr folder and is not accessible without using unix commands to reveal the said files.  Is there any way I can successfully install and use the GLEW library so I do not get the no directory error?  BTW, reference for installation guide for GLEW:  http://glew.sourceforge.net/install.html  <comment117900> See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12229714/building-glew-for-mac-osx and was your install just `make install`
