How to avoid pop-up message on VPN connection? <body> Apple Mac OS can display a server side configured message when you establish a vpn connection (Cisco IPSec in my case).  I want to disable this annoying popup so how can I configure the VPN configuration to just ignore this message instead of prompting me to press the ok button.  <comment348685> Looking for similar solution. Did you find anyway?? Please share
