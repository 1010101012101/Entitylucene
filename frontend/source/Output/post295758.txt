Is there an external SSD enclosure compatible with OWC Aura SSD? <body> I have bought an OWC Aura SSD that I have used to expand the memory of my previous Macbook. Now, for various reasons, I would like to use the Aura SSD as an external drive. Is there any enclosure available which is compatible with it? Apparently, the Envoy enclosure it was delivered with is not - it is only intended to be used with the original Apple SSD. I found the following disclaimer in the product description:     "Important Note: The OWC Envoy enclosure has been specifically   designed for use ONLY with the factory SSD found installed in Apple   MacBook Air and MacBook Pro with Retina display mid-2013 and later   models. Do NOT attempt to install or use the OWC Aura SSD in the Envoy   as you can damage the Aura drive, the Envoy enclosure or both and such   damage is not covered under warranty."   OWC Aura SSD product description  <answer295769> As far as I know, there's no such enclosure on the market today.  The reason behind the disclaimer is that the OWC drive produces more heat than the Apple-supplied drive. The enclosure simply does not cool the OWC sufficiently.  You could add some custom cooling to the enclosure (or simply not put on the lid), and make sure that the temperature stays within specs.  <comment373572> Why use an enclosure? I just attach my bare SSD with a cable/SATA adapter that was part of an enclosure.
