Zoom/Expand part of my Mac's screen <body> Is there a way to zoom in/expand/enlarge part of my Mac's screen to fill the entire screen?  Basically, I'm looking for an app that allows you to select a part of the screen and that will then expand that part of the screen all the way to cover the full screen. So if I have a monitor that measures 1366x768 and I select a part of the screen that is 500X300 it will then enlarge that small part to cover the full available screen real estate.   <answer246426> I guess if you want a rectangle or circle you'll need to find a screen zoom app.   I just use   kbdCommand/kbd kbdOption/kbd  kbd8/kbd to toggle default zoom.   kbdCommand/kbd kbdOption/kbd kbd=/kbd to zoom in and   kbdCommand/kbd kbdOption/kbd kbd-/kbd to zoom out.   It centres the zoom on where the mouse is.  <answer246431> You can use the built-in zoom feature to zoom in on a part of the screen on your Mac.   (strongNote/strong: these instructions are adapted for El Capitan but also work with Sierra and as far back as Lion, though certain menus/buttons may be labeled differently).  ol liGo to System Preferences/li liNavigate to the Accessibility Settings menu/li liChoose codeZoom/code from the pane on the left./li liEnable codeUse keyboard shortcuts to zoom/code./li liEnable codeSmooth images/code (for better quality with images)/li liEnable codeZoom follows the keyboard focus/code./li liEnsure your Zoom settings match these:/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7irC7.png" alt="Ideal zoom settings"  ol start="8" liThen, choose between Picture-in-picture and Fullscreen for the codeZoom Style/code; strongsee the pictures below for help choosing./strong/li /ol  strongZoom in codepicture-in-picture/code mode:/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CuZXs.jpg" alt="Picture-in-picture mode"  strongZoom in codefullscreen/code mode:/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/h10Cd.jpg" alt="Fullscreen mode"  After turning on Zoom, you can control it with keyboard shortcuts, as mentioned by Paul Zagoridis:  kbdCommand/kbd+kbdOption/kbd+kbd8/kbd toggles zoom on/off.   kbdCommand/kbd+kbdOption/kbd+kbd=/kbd zooms in.   kbdCommand/kbd+kbdOption/kbd+kbd-/kbd zooms out.

Lets suppose I have a black box 200 px by 200 px on a screen, I want to select that black box,and only see that black box and nothing surrounding it blowed up to the full size of the screen ( aspect ration kept though)  - is there a magnifier that will do that? <comment328811> Is the mouse gesture zoom working for you in Sierra?  It doesn't work for me. <comment328911> @wim For me, yep. Try switching the modifier key to just `option`. Here's a video of it working on my MBP running Sierra 10.12.1: https://goo.gl/photos/KcW4ynEmX8gbbmrC8 <comment328946> Damn, I'm on 10.12.1 and it doesn't work <comment329028> @wim try changing the modifier key. <comment329055> Yeah, I've tried all three choices - no good.
