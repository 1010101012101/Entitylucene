Dual-booting a Linux distribution on a Mac with Fusion Drive <body> I'd like to install a Linux distribution alongside OS X on my 2014 5k iMac with a 3TB Fusion Drive (128GB SSD + 3TB HDD).  Most guides about dual-booting Linux I've found focus on regular partitioning, that is, no Core Storage, and I couldn't find one that helped.  I want to keep OS X in case I have to use software that isn't available on Linux, like XCode or PhotoShop.  My goal is to use Linux as my main system, and I want the root (code//code) partition to live on the SSD to speed up boot, and the home partition to be on the HDD.  Here's the potential solution I found (haven't tried yet):  ol liSplit the Fusion Drive/li liDownload and install OS X El Capitan on the SSD from the recovery partition/li liBoot into El Capitan/li licodediskutil cs revert &lt;UUID&gt;/code on the Logical Volume which emshould/em be marked as codeRevertible/code in codediskutil cs list/code/li liResize the HFS+ OS X partition to around 60 GB/li liInstall a Linux distro (Ubuntu, at first) on the free space/li liCreate another partition on the HDD for code/home/code/li liIf it's possible, assign both partitions to a volume group using LVM/li /ol  Is this possible, or have I missed something that will make it fail?  <comment255964> Which Linux do you intend to install? Do you intend to have a LVM for Linux? <comment255965> @DavidAnderson Ubuntu at first, but if I can install it, I should be able to switch distros by installing the new one on the root partition while keeping my `/home`, right? As for the LVM - I don't think it's essential. If it's significantly more complex than a regular partition scheme, then no, but retaining the ability to change later on would be a plus. <comment255969> Actually, I just read up on LVM, and it would make later changes _much_ more convenient. So if it's possible, I will have a LVM. <comment255970> @DavidAnderson I edited my question to clarify it.
