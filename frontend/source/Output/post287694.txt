Photos: Stuck on "Searching for additional photos" <body> Photos has been running for a few days and when going to the search for additional faces page, the animated "Searching for additional photos" has been spinning for a couple of days.  The total number of photos is 13,204 and it says there are 557 videos.  Machine is a 27 inch mid-2011 iMac, 16GB memory, 3.4 GHz processor.  Processor use is near 0; activity monitor shows no measured activity.  Is there a way to reset the cache or faces database to force Photos to rebuild that database? I tried following directions to do a repair, but all Photos will do is ask me what library I want to use; I select the library "file" and it opens Photos, without doing any repair.
