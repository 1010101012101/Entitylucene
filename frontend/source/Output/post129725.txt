MB Air 10.9.2 Can't connect to internet ethernet or Wifi <body> I have learned that all PCs in my office can connect but no iPhones/iPads can connect. I have the only MB Air.   I get this error: "Ethernet has a self-assigned IP address and will not be able to connect."  <comment151838> Do you have more details for us? <comment152148> Can you say whether 'no iPhones/iPads can connect' means your office IT people have asked you not to connect them?  If so, we can help you talk your IT people into changing their mind or policy.  Otherwise, we can help with the particular error you mentioned.
