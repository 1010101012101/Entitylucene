Why is Xcode 6 Beta download so slow? <body> I'm in the process of downloading the Xcode 6 beta, and it's downloading painfully slowly, &lt;10kb/s, and as of now is forecasting that it'll take 2 days, 20 hours, and 55 minutes and climbing.  Is there a mirror somewhere I can download this beta?  <answer132961> Because everyone wants to download things from Apple right now. 10.10 Beta access, iOS 8 beta, XCode 6 beta. Their servers are under stress. Unless it's your own connection, but I'm sure you checked that :)  <comment157439> That is probably a good guess. Did you run a Ping to verify ? <comment157442> @Buscar How would a ping verify this? <comment157447> @GeorgeGarside you mean to say that a ping reply from busy server is the same as from not busy one <comment157448> @Buscarì›ƒ I tried pinging and I got timeout errors, don't know if thats related. <comment157451> @BritishColour AFAIK it is related, try Pinging Google. <comment157455> Pinging is related, but not a definite solution in case pinging works. But if you get timeout errors, you know something is wrong. Server-side or client site, but you can rule out the last one by pinging google. If that works fine, the server is indeed busy. Give it a couple of hours, let it run overnight or try again tomorrow. Everyone is downloading it right now <comment157456> @Buscar No, I mean could you clarify how pinging a server 'verifies' that the server is overloaded and this is causing the slow download speed? <comment157461> This question appears to be off-topic because it is about transitory download congestion. <comment157462> @GeorgeGarside as you well know normaly the Ping do not overload a server. However if the server is extremely busy (overcapacity) the Pint reply time would be in hundreds not in tens, or it will Ping out. It is a very crude way I know, but a bench mark. <comment157464> I had pinged Google and got ~20ms <comment157477> Hm... Off-topic pre-release does not really fit. But yes, it's off-topic nevertheless... <comment157479> 1st) Ping might be dropped. 2nd) Ping might be prioritized. 3rd) The pong might come from a different machine than you addressed it to. Ping is only meaningful to you if you control the entire path.
