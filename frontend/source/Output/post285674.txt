Recover lost text on Safari (ipad) <body> Is there a way to recover unsaved data typed on a web form on ipad which was lost when Safari automatically reloaded?  I do not have the skills to recover lost data (if that is even possible) but if there is a theoretical probability I want to give this a go. How can I preserve the contents of my ipad's RAM or Safari's cache so I can analyse them at a later date?   <comment360363> You can't. There's no possible way to analyze the iPad's RAM, and once you submitted or the page was reloaded, the data was deleted.
