Having trouble locating all photos from multiple hard drives <body> I'm trying to consolidate my late father's photo collection. I have found some photos hiding in various iPhoto libraries.  He had 2 macs, 2 users for both, had multiple backups (but over the last 3 years at least some are unreadable).  There are some photos that I have not been able to recover and place in the photos library.  I have only been able to view them in the "change desktop background" under the iPhoto/Photos section but I cannot find them any other way. This option is clearly using a different directory for photos than I have found.  To complicate matters, I recently updated the OS to El Capitan from snow leopard.  Is there a way I can find out where these are hiding?  Thanks for any help.  <comment322041> Wow... have you checked the trashes of the photo libraries? <comment322130> Whatever you see under Photos section sits in your _current_ Photos library. So you should look for the specific photos there.
