Help to delete music <body> Can I delete music off my phone without this deleting my music on my iTunes account? If I can then will the songs reappear once I plug my phone back into my mac  I need space on my phone but don't want to loose it completely or for it too reappear when I sync it.  <answer163641> You could delete a song in the iTunes app on your device just by swyping from right to left over the song name. There will be an option to delete the song.  <comment191636> Will they reappear once I plug my phone back into my mac?
