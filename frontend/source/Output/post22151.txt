My iOS 5 Beta 1 Expired! Now what? <body> I recently brought an iPod 4g. And one of my friend who was an iPhone application developer helped me upgrade my os to iOS 5 Beta 1. Now he is out of station and my iPod is locked.   I cannot do anything with my iPod.   Please advice me on how to degrade the OS to my previous version?   Thanks &amp; Regards,  <answer22154> Not sure you can downgrade but try: Settings - General - Software Update ... there have been new Beta's so that might solve the problem.  <answer22155> Well, this is timely.  Download the iOS 4.3.5 iPod touch firmware image, put your iPod touch in DFU mode, then use iTunes to restore to 4.3.5:  ol liLaunch iTunes./li liConnect your iPod to your computer./li liShut it down by pressing and holding the power button for five seconds, then sliding to the right./li liPress and hold the home and power buttons for ten seconds. Afterwards, release the power button, but continue to press the home button until iTunes detects the iPod./li liIf iTunes doesn't ask you for the file, kbd‚å•/kbd-click the strongRestore/strong button. This should let you select the code.ipsw/code file you have downloaded./li /ol  <comment24494> Does it show up in iTunes? How did it get locked? <comment24495> Did you read the question? Its locked. I would downvote you but you only have 3 rep. <comment24496> Welcome to Ask Different! Questions about pre-release software are off-topic for this site.

Thanks. <comment24497> Ah, ok, point taken. <comment24498> Read the instructions Apple has posted on the developer forums on how you can get a newer beta. You will have to restore the device eventually when iOS 5 is eventually released, so you can wait for that or get a more current beta. This is how the betas work - it was clear this could happen in the release notes for that update. <comment24516> And Software Update didn't work until Beta 3. <comment24562> Take this as a lesson, developer previews are, surprisingly, for developers; and preview and beta means not ready for release, in other words things like this will happen.
