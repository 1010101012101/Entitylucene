Monitor hard drive usage history? <body> On Mavericks, is there a way to monitor hard drive use history?   To be clear, I do not only want to know how much space I am using on my hard drive. I would like a history of my hard drive space usage over time.  ul liIs there a feature built into Maverick that would allow me to do that? Or any additional app?/li liIf there is, will this built-in feature/app be able to recover information from my past use, or will it only start to record my usage once I set it up?/li /ul  I know that I could record my usage manually, but I'd rather have it done automatically.  EDIT : as far as the frequency of observations is concerned, I'd be satisfied with something ranging from every day to once a week.  <answer120951> How about something simple in your crontab?  precode@daily (date; df)&gt;&gt; ~/drive_usage.log /code/pre  Which will, on a daily basis, append to the file drive_usage.log in your home directory with the date and time the job ran.  Change @daily to @hourly or @weekly if you want different sampling rates.

It is server monitoring software and one of the things it monitors is disk space usage.  Munin Mac install docs here.  (Yes, this is a rather heavyweight solution, but you get graphing! :)  <comment140958> At what frequency shall it be. Once per year, per month, week, day, hours, minute second ?...you see the problem ! <comment140963> Yes, thanks, I'll make it more precise in the question. <comment140970> That's 365 records per year! And could be very confusing results, since some days it will be up the others, it will be down, pending your email and web usages. So let's tune it further a bit. Than lets see if someone will write you a script to do that, since currently there is no such recording, other than some records in your Console that you can look up. <comment140987> Is it a problem computationally or in terms of the script to have a new record no less than every week? If it is not, this is really what I would need. I someone can write a script that would be great. I am also ready to learn and do it myself if it turns out to be an accessible project  for someone who has little programming experience and has never written scripts for OSX (I have never done it before). But I would probably need some guidance then... <comment140996> yeah seems a little bit using a sledgehammer to crack a nut, but thanks anyways, might come back to it if nothing else works. <comment140997> Thanks, I am not familiar with using crontab, but I will look into it. This seems like the solution I need. <comment141090> Try `man 5 crontab` in Terminal as a starter.  Also take a look at the pr(1) command if you get into the scripting, you could without too much effort generate a CSV file which you could then put into Numbers / Excel etc. <comment141417> I tried to implement the command following http://www.maclife.com/article/columns/terminal_101_creating_cron_jobs. I'll let you know how it works out. <comment141476> Good stuff - you can use the shortcuts: `@yearly, @monthly, @weekly, @daily, @hourly and @reboot` in OS X which can make things a little clearer
