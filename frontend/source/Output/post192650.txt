Equivalent to top -ua <body> In older version of Mac OS X, maybe up to 10.6 or something like that, you could use codetop/code with code-ua/code which stronga/strongccumulated CPU-usage and listed the process with most CPU-time at the top. This combination has since disappeared and I have been unable to find a replacement. Any ideas?  A nice addition would be if you could tell it to accumulate CPU-hsitory for e.g., 10 seconds, 1 minute or so, is that possible?  <answer192653> You're right, codetop/code has changed since 10.6 (Here is the man page for the codetop/code on Snow Leopard)  Now, to access to the accumulative mode you have to   ul listart codetop/code/li litype kbdc/kbd to change the current mode /li litype kbda/kbd to set the accumulative mode (and enter to validate the input) /li /ul  To sort by CPU time, use the code-o/code option :  codetop -o time/code  About the second part of your question, I a bit curious. Accumulative mode counts the CPU time since the start of the mode. So I will do it for 10sec if you wait 10 seconds etc.   <comment229321> Regarding the second part I am interested in (1) a "floating accumulated" value, i.e., leaving top running in the background and everytime I looked at it I would see what had used most CPU time the last minute or something like that, or (2), start top and then it automatically quit after ten seconds leaving a list of the PIDs that had used most CPU during the session.
