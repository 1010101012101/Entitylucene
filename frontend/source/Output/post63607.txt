USB Overdrive Only Detects One Controller <body> I'm trying to get my Twin USB Joystick to work with some games I have. I'm using USB Overdrive, however, it doesn't seem to detect the 2nd controller. It only detects one. For example, if I configure the buttons using the first controller, it goes as normally. However, if I use the 2nd controller to configure the keys, it highlights the same buttons that controller 1 used.
