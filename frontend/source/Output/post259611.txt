Device Manager fails to start on a macOS Server 5.2 <body> I have setup a working Open Directory Master on on codeMac-Server-1/code running macOS Sierra and macOS Server 5.2 (latest as of today).  I have also successfully started the Device Manager and enrolled a client computer with no problem.  I have now also setup a working Open Directory Replica on codeMac-Server-2/code running MacOS Sierra and macOS Server 5.2.  However, when I try to activate the Device Manager on the Replica, it stays Disabled.  Is this by design that Device Manager can only be active on the Master?  Or is this a bug?  Steps:  ol liIn macOS Server - Profile Manger - Device Manager, status is codeDisabled/code/li liIn macOS Server - Profile Manger - Device Manager, I click codeSetup.../code button /li liNew window appears telling me I can manage devices.  I click codeNext/code/li liThe window now changes and asks me for a Name, E-mail, Telephone, and Address (presumably to generate a certificate?)/li liI enter the info, and click codeNext/code/li liThe next window appears, telling me to click codeFinish/code.  I do./li liThe window disappears, returning me to the macOS Server - Profile Manger window, where the status of Device Manager still shows as codeDisabled/code/li /ol  Ideas?  strongEdit1/strong: I tried uninstalling Server.app and deleting /Library/Server/* and reinstalling the Replica from scratch.  Same behavior.  strongEdit2/strong: I tried reinstalling the entire server from scratch.  Same behavior.  <comment325369> no one has any experience with a multi-site macOS (or OS X) Server setup?
