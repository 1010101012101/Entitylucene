How to fix «event coreslct» error? <body> I have an AppleScript source with this code:  precodetell "Microsoft Word"      «event coreslct» (last row of table X of document Y)     insert rows selection position below number of rows Z end tell /code/pre  After some research, I found that codecoreslct/code is the code for the select command. It's used in all AppleScriptable Office applications, and has been around in both Office 2008 and 2011.  However, the code seem to have disappeared from Office 2016...   How can I fix this? Our users use both Office 2011 and 2016...
