How do I know which Python install is being used? <body> If I type the command codewhich python/code, then I get:  precodeOliviers-iMac:~$ which -a python /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/python /usr/bin/python /code/pre  If I then type codepython --version/code, how do I know which Python install I'm getting the version of? Are the two locations above 2 different Python installs?  <answer125829> code/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/python/code is most likely a symlink.   codereadlink/code on a simlink will give you the target.   For example on my Mavericks installation I have following :   precode$readlink /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/python python2 $readlink /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/python2 python2.7 /code/pre  Which means when I run codepython/code it actually runs code/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/python2.7/code  hr  Also there is something funny, when running code/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/python2.7/code  Try this  precode&gt;&gt;&gt; import sys &gt;&gt;&gt; print sys.executable  /code/pre  Which will return this :   precode/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Resources/Python.app/Contents/MacOs/Python /code/pre  <comment147284> Strange! I wonder why intermediary simlinks are required? Maybe it's because python 2.7 extends python 2 which extends python? <comment147288> By the way, when you say that /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/python is most likely a simlink, do you mean that it points to /usr/bin/python? DO simlinks always point to binaries in /usr/bin? (Sorry for the noob questions!) <comment147292> symlink can point to anything anywere. File, directory, binary. There (a bit) like aliases. <comment147293> `which python` i.e. without the -a tells you which one will be used <comment147299> I suppose which one gets executed depends on the order in $PATH, right? <comment147323> @Oliver yes correct
