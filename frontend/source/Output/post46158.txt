What functionality of iOS can be accessed from the lock screen? <body> I know that in iOS, several parts of the iDevice's functionality can be accessed from the lock screen. This is useful when you don't want to fumble with a password.  But now I'm starting to wonder: what else can be accessed from the lock screen? I know these:  ul liThree-home-button tap to invert screen (when Universal Access is enabled)/li liDouble tap to play music/li /ul  What else can be accessed from the iOS lock screen?  h2EDIT:/h2  As Daniel L mentioned,      "It shouldn't produce a bunch of partial answers; a good answer will   include a canonical listing (with sources) of what can be accessed   from the iOS lock screen. There is a right answer to this question."   Please, make your answer a canonical listing (with sources) of what can be accessed from the iOS lock screen.  <answer46159> Starting with iOS 5, the camera can be accessed from the lockscreen (obviously only on devices that have a camera). On iOS 5.0.x, double-clicking the home button reveals a camera button next to the unlock slider that can be clicked, and in iOS 5.1, there is a permanent camera button that you slide up to reveal the camera under the lockscreen.  <answer46160> Hard to know what qualifies as the features you know about and what is "else", but one other new feature is accessing notifications on the lock screen by swiping them.  <answer46161> Here's an older flowchart that gives a good overview of the home button features, and on the right side what you can do starting from the lock screen:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MmW1X.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer46546> I'm including the ones mentioned in your answer in the name of having a complete listing in one place.  ul listrongToggle music controls/strong (Play/Pause, Previous, Next, Volume) by double tapping the home button./li listrongTake pictures/strong and videos by sliding the camera button. /li listrongInvoke accessibility features/strong by triple clicking the home button.

I don't care if it is something I know, but please don't make it one of the 2 I mentioned in the question. <comment52673> I see the lock screen stuff starting on the right, not left. <comment52702> On my iOS 5.1 iPhone, nothing happens with 4x Home taps. <comment52723> @KatieK: hmm. Just tried it with a 4.x device and it seems to work. Maybe it's 3 taps? <comment52727> This should probably be a community wiki question. <comment52772> @KatieK It's a setting. I believe it is under Universal Access or the like. <comment52773> It shouldn't produce a bunch of partial answers; a good answer will include a canonical listing (with sources) of what can be accessed from the iOS lock screen. There is a right answer to this question. <comment52783> @DanielL: Yes, I agree. I'll give the green check to whoever does that the best. <comment53208> Awesome. Finally, a decent answer. Is this a complete answer? If it is, I'd like a source. <comment53209> Not sure if this is complete; it's just what I've been able to find myself. Since this is just based on personal experience, I don't have a source. Feel free to test though :) <comment53213> I can't think of anything else other than the static information displayed (Carrier, Connectivity [3G, 4G, WiFi], battery life, and the time).
