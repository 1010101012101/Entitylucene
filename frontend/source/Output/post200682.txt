How to activate and run JavaScript in AppleScript? <body> I'm trying to run simple script in emAppleScript Editor/em on OS X 10.9.5, but using JavaScript, e.g.:  precodevar SE = new Application("System Events"); SE.processes.windows.name() /code/pre  However my dropdown only shows emAppleScript/em.  How do I activate JavaScript if it isn't appearing on the list? It is also not in emPreferences/General/em.  <answer200685> You cannot. JavaScript for Automation was only introduced in OS X 10.10 Yosemite.  AppleScript Editor.app was also renamed to Script Editor.app due to it now not only being for AppleScript.
