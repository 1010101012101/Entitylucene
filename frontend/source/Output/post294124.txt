Third-party keyboard disappears after app update <body> I’m using a third-party keyboard (stronggBoard/strong, provided by the Google app), and I notice that anytime the Google app updates, the keyboard disappears from all my running applications. I have to shut them down and relaunch them for gBoard to appear again.    Is there a way for apps to automatically load the new gBoard once it’s installed, without having to quit and relaunch them?
