Screen Sharing in El Capitan – Gone? <body> When I upgraded from Yosemite to El Capitan, I got a warning about Apple’s Screen Sharing.app being not supported.   Sure enough, an alias to the app was moved to a folder named "Incompatible Software". When I run the app, it never connects to the server.  Is there some replacement for this functionality (VNC screen sharing) bundled into El Capitan? Or did Apple really just drop this important feature?  <answer210656> It's under code/System/Library/CoreServices/Applications/Screen\ Sharing.app/code here. You should still be able to call it directly (e.g. via Spotlight) or just use kbdCmd-K/kbd in Finder to initiate a VNC session (use codevnc:NAME-OF-REMOTE-SYSTEM/code as address).   <comment254228> Did you try going to Safari and type vnc://ip.of.machine in the URL bar? <comment260599> I don't know what caused the initial messages. Indeed launching that app or using the `vnc:` in `Finder`  `Go`  `Connect to Server` does indeed run the Screen Sharing app successfully.
