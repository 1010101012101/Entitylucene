Missing "Move to Dropbox" contextual menu option <body> A while ago, I lost the "Move to Dropbox" option in my Finder's contextual menu, and, originally, I didn't make much of it since I read that it was an issue/bug in OS X, which Dropbox reported to Apple. I recently installed Dropbox on my work Mac and noticed that the option displays as expected, so I'm trying to restore it on my home Mac.  EDIT: Image for reference img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/K6Ct9.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  I'm currently running Sierra beta 5, but the issue also occurred in El Capital. So far, I've tried the following coupled with killing the Finder process each time:  ul liToggling the Finder integration via Dropbox/li liUninstalling Dropbox with AppCleaner and reinstalling/li liDeleting ~/.dropbox folder/li liDeleting ~/Dropbox/.dropbox.cache folder/li liDeleting /Library/DropboxHelperTools folder, which Dropbox recreated/li liToggling Finder integration in System Preferences  Extensions/li liToggling System Preferences  Keyboard  Shortcuts  Services  Folder Actions Setup.../li liDisabling (and later re-enabling) csrutil/li liRestarting Mac/li /ul  The latest version of Dropbox doesn't have the "Fix Permissions" option anymore, so I can't try that, but I have in the past. What I find strange is that the contextual menu options emwithin/em the Dropbox folder display as expected, while not in my local folders.  As you can tell, I've done my research to no avail, so any help would be appreciated!  <answer249262> I discovered that the contextual menu option only displays within folders on the primary drive. Since my Documents, Downloads, etc. folders are on a secondary drive, it doesn't display, despite the fact that my Dropbox folder is also on this secondary drive.  <comment308808> What contextual menu? <comment308810> @Peanut I added an image for reference. <comment308812> What appears under Services in the menu? <comment308816> @Peanut Share? Various first- and third-party apps, but not Dropbox.
