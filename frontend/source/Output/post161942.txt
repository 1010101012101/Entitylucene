Upgrade to iCloud Drive: "...devices below will not be able to access..." <body> I'm running Yosemite on a mid-2012 MBP. When I try to upgrade to iCloud Drive on my iPad or my MBP it states that my MBP will not be able to access files on iCloud Drive until I upgrade it to Yosemite. I'm already running Yosemite. Is this a bug?  <comment189208> Is there any other MBP associated with your Apple ID? <comment189209> No, the only other devices on this ID are an iMac and an iPad. I considered that maybe it was using my MBP name instead of my iMac name because my iMac is still running Mavericks. However, iCloud.com had all the correct computer names, so I know that it's not alerting me of the iMac (which is strange, because it should). <comment189210> Any reason why your iMac isn't on Yosemite yet? <comment189211> I ask because you could upgrade it and see what happens when the setup process asks you about iCloud Drive. <comment189212> It's in another country and I don't use it a lot anymore, so upgrading it to Yosemite would be a waste of time. I intend to upgrade it later, just for consistency and keeping things up-to-date, but I can't now. <comment189215> Wait, the MBP warns you about itself? "When I try to upgrade to iCloud Drive on my iPad or my MBP..." <comment189268> Exactly. That's what doesn't make sense about this.
