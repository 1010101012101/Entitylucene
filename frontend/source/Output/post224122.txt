How to type floating point numbers in Apple Numbers in Persian? <body> When I want to insert a floating number in Apple Numbers 3.6.1 in OS X 10.10.5 while my primary preferred language in codeLanguage &amp; Region/code is Persian(فارسی), the number is interpreted as a string value.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2mqrd.png" alt="enter image description here"  In these screenshots the right cell has the formula of codeB2 ÷ 2/code while codeB2/code is the left cell. I typed code۱.۲۳/code (that is code1.23/code in Persian) in codeB2/code with Persian keyboard layout and an error is occurred.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ykYYH.png" alt="enter image description here"  The result is the same when i type the number with English keyboard layout.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cdVm5.png" alt="enter image description here"  How can i enter a floating point number?  <answer224123> Note that in Persian language the floating point sign is represented with code,/code. So the problem can be solved by entering the number as code۱,۲۳/code or code1,23/code.  In the first form when you want to enter the floating point sign, switch the keyboard layout to English then insert ‍code,/code and then switch it back to Persian and insert the remaining fraction part.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2bl4Y.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bhmLL.png" alt="enter image description here"
