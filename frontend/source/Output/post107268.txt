Cross-Platform alternative to expr length <body> When running some BASH scripts I had in my Linux box I noticed that codeexpr length/code gives syntax error.  Manual pages doesn't seems to include any information about the length operator. Is it missing in Mac OS X?  What other cross-platform alternative can I use?  <answer107270> Instead of codeexpr length 'keyword'/code you can use awk. An example would look like this codeecho 'keyword' | awk '{ print length }'/code  precodebounty:~ napcae$ echo 'keyword' | awk '{ print length }'   7 /code/pre  <answer107271> Could you share the portion of the script that does not work on your Mac OS X? codeexpr/codein general adheres to codeIEEE Std 1003.1-2008 (POSIX.1)/code and is available on all Unix Systems with the same semantics.  If you share some more information regarding your bash script, I am sure we can help. Your posted example of codeexpr length/code, albeit being pretty useless per se, runs perfectly fine in my Mac OS X Mavericks Shell:  precode~$ expr length length /code/pre  Not sure what you have tried to achieve, but I could imagine your were trying to get the length of a string?  precode~$ a="non sequitur" ~$ expr \( "X$a" : ".*" \) - 1 12 ~$ echo ${#a} 12 /code/pre  With regard to cross-platform, it really depends on what you are trying to accomplish with your bash script. Bash by itself is pretty cross-platform.  <comment125855> Just what I was looking for, thanks!
