Enable internet sharing via iPhone USB <body> This is not a duplicate of the questions posted here  and here  It is a duplicate of the question posted here however there is no answer to that question and one of the commenters is wrong about the direction of sharing. I am posting this again to hopefully get a solution for this.  I have enabled internet sharing in OSX via settings - sharing then clicking on internet sharing. I have tried this using wifi which works just fine, however I am no longer allowed to create a wifi network because security.   My new plan is to use the iPhone USB option to share my Mac's ethernet connection with my iPhone. The setup seems simple and I have selected "Share your connection from: Ethernet" "To computers using: iPhone USB". I don't currently have a connection to the internet. Is there something else I need to do?   <answer104991> Nope, won't work. The iPhone needs a Wireless network to connect to the internet.   If you aren't connected to a Wifi network and you disabled cellular data, you'll get a popup saying you need a connection.   <answer290845> The question is old but it seems it is now possible to share a Mac Internet connection from the ethernet port, with an iPhone connected to the Mac via a USB ↔ lightning cable,   ul liEnsure the Mac Internet is working properly via the (thunderbolt adapter) ethernet port /li liConnect the iPhone (iPad) via the USB ↔ lightning cable/li liUnlock the iPhone ; if its asks for "Trust this computer?", tap "Trust"/li liGo to the Mac kbdSystem Preferences/kbd kbdSharing/kbd [ uncheck "Internet sharing" if it is checked in order to allow changes to "To computers using:" ]/li liChoose "Share your connection from:" either "Ethernet" or "Thunderbolt ethernet"/li liCheck the "To computers using:" "iPhone USB" box then check the "Internet sharing" service./li /ul  The iPhone should now be able to use Internet from the Mac.  If you want to be sure the iPhone is really using the Mac connection, switch off "Wifi" and "Cellular data".
