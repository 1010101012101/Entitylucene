Windows 10 (bootcamp) update failure <body> After the update and restart, windows couldnt install the update properly. I ignored this and now, none of my apps are working. For example, the system32/config/userprofile is empty. Powerpoint, excel, autocad, matlab, etc are not opening at all. How can I reset my OS?  And after any win10 update, on restarting, MacOS opens instead of win10. Is this a reason?   One more thing is, this problem started after macOS sierra update.  <comment320593> You say _windows couldn't install an update properly_, but you also say _this problem started after [a] macOS sierra update_. I would seem you have two different problems. Perhaps you should post these problems as separate questions.
