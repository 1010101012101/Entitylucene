Mission Control randomly "stuck" on MacBookPro 15 inch 2016 model ... workarounds? <body> Mission control's zoom feature allows me to partially zoom out and partially zoom back to normal mode.  Assume for a second that I can zoom out into mission control by the slightest degree. (about 1/2 inch or smaller).   While the display is in this mode, I'm unable to scroll within safari, edit or type within parallels, etc because I'm in "zoom mode".  For all intents and purposes the Mac feels like it "crashed", even though I'm only in mission control.  Furthermore, even when I remove my hands from the keyboard, the zoom is stuck and doesn't "spring back" until I manually zoom back using a mouse gesture.   strongQuestion/strong  Is there anything I can do to make the zoom spring back? or make it more apparent I'm within "mission control" mode?  ... and confirm the Mac hasn't crashed? This is very frustrating while scrolling, or editing a document. The whole system appears to freeze and on occasion I have hard-booted the Mac in response to this almost imperceptible issue.   I ask on behalf of other users I support who also experience this issue.   <comment349266> EDIT: This appears to occur when I only have one application open, and swipe 3 fingers down.
