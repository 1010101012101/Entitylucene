Editing songs in iTunes 11.0.2 <body> I've recently got a new Windows laptop and downloaded and installed the latest iTunes (11.0.2). All my music (over 5000 songs) went into iTunes fine, just as they were on my old laptop. However I have now noticed that when I download new music and add it to my iTunes it won't allow me to edit the songs through "Get Info" even though the songs I transferred from my old laptop can be edited perfectly fine. Can anyone help? Thank you.  <answer84569> ol licheck if you have relocated songs./li licheck if your files can be rewritten./li /ol  I use self-written python program to remove stale content.  precodeimport win32com.client itunes= win32com.client.Dispatch("iTunes.Application") ITTrackKindFile=1 mainLibrary = itunes.LibraryPlaylist tracks = mainLibrary.Tracks numTracks = tracks.Count deletedTracks=0 batch_size = 90  deleted = [] while True:   while numTracks  !=0:    currTrack=tracks.Item(numTracks)    if currTrack.Kind == ITTrackKindFile:        if currTrack.Location == "":          deleted.append(currTrack)    numTracks-=1    for track in deleted:       track.Delete()       deletedTracks+=1    del deleted[:] # free memory and close handles    if not numTracks:      break  if deletedTracks &gt; 0: if deletedTracks == 1:   print "Removed 1 dead track." else:   print "Removed " + str(deletedTracks) + " dead tracks." else:   print "No dead tracks were found." /code/pre  <comment97363> I've not relocated the songs because the songs play fine but I do use an external hard-drive so I don't know if that has anything to do with it? How do I check if files can be rewritten? Thanks for your help. <comment97375> to check if files are relocated in any way, you should checkout info for path. To check existence you should type full path in Explorer's address field. <comment97376> I guess that drive or path to your music folder has been changed since you moved to new laptop. <comment97382> I've just added program which I use to remove stale tracks from library
