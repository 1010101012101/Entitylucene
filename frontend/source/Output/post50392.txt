iPhone simulator on iPad <body> When using an iPad if you download and use an iphone application, an iphone outline will appear on the screen with the application inside.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HH9ad.png" alt="enter image description here"  I'm looking for a way to switch between viewing websites normally as they would appear on the iPad and iphone view.  What would be the best way of going about this?  <answer50394> Download an iPad browser, such as Dolphin Browser or Opera Mini.br Then download a web browser that is iPhone/iPod touch only, such as Mango Browser, iFox FREE, Sphere, or Full Screen Web Browser (99Â¢). Then you can run an iPad browser in the full iPad mode and run another browser that is in the 1x 2x iPhone mode.  <answer101669> iPadPeek is a website service where you can check how your website looks on different iOS devices like iPhone4, iPhone5, iPad Mini, iPad Retina, etc.  There are a lot more website offering such services where you can check your website not only on iOS devices but different browser versions running on different operating systems. You also dont need iPad to do this. You can check it on any OS with any browser.  PS: Moderator, please check the link before deleting my answer again.

Though there is some room for improvement. Thanks! <comment57916> @PhilipK Awesome! Glad I could help! <comment318332> Any new updates on this? I want to keep my iPhone 5 sized phone, but would love to test iPhone 6 and 6+ in a native way - on an iPad. Thanks.
