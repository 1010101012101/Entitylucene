Facetime Applescript Edit <body> Does anyone know a quick way that I could modify the following script (from CornDoggyRob) to automatically maximize the incoming call window and to adjust the orientation? I would love to try this with a couple people with disabilities, who are unable to physically answer/adjust the size, and I have tried a number of things, but I am afraid I am far too unfamiliar with AppleScript commands.  — Facetime Auto Answer — Copyright ©2010 CornDog Computers — twitter: @CornDoggyRob  precoderepeat         — Check to see if Facetime is active         tell application "System Events" to set theCount to the count of (processes whose name is "Facetime")         if theCount = 0 then                 do shell script "sleep 1"         else                 tell application "FaceTime" to activate                 do shell script "sleep 2"                 tell application "FaceTime" to activate                 tell application "System Events" to tell process "FaceTime"                         if name of front window contains "with" then                                 do shell script "sleep 5"                         else                                 tell application "System Events" to activate application "FaceTime"                                 keystroke return                                 do shell script "sleep 5"                                 — Check to see if call is active                                 tell application "System Events" to tell process "FaceTime"                                         if name of front window contains "with" then                                                 do shell script "sleep 5"                                         else                                                 — Quit Facetime if call is not active                                                 tell application "FaceTime" to quit                                                 do shell script "sleep 5"                                         end if                                 end tell                         end if                 end tell         end if end repeat end /code/pre  <answer126530> It appears to be doable. From   http://www.macosxautomation.com/applescript/firsttutorial/11.html  To get the application/windows dimensions  precodetell application "Finder" to get the bounds of the front window --&gt; returns something like: {72, 90, 512, 481} /code/pre  to change it  precodetell application "Finder" to set the bounds of the front Finder window to {24, 96, 524, 396} /code/pre  and to find the dimensions of your display  precodetell application "Finder" to get the bounds of the window of the desktop --&gt; returns: {0, 0, 1920, 1200} /code/pre
