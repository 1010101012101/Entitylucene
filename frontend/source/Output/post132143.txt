How to navigate spaces in a dual monitor setup? <body> I have multiple spaces setup and can navigate them via kbdctrl/kbd and the arrow keys emleft/em and emright/em on the current active monitor.  Now I want to change to a space that sits on the other monitor.  How do I switch there? I am looking for a keyboard only solution.  <answer136135> Here's a shell one-liner that will do what you ask:  precodecliclick -r m:=-50,300 w:50 kd:ctrl kp:arrow-left ku:ctrl w:50 /code/pre  ul licliclick is a tool to move the mouse and is unfortunately necessary for this/li licode-r/code: When done, move the mouse back to where it was when it started/li licodem:=-50,300/code: move the mouse to the coordinates (-50, 300).

Not an ideal solution, by a long shot, but it is better than reaching for the mouse. <comment283119> @JedDaniels Why did you post it as a comment and not as an answer? <comment283123> I don't think it is an answer, just a barely functional workaround. I suppose I can put it as an answer if you'd like. I'm still looking for the right AppleScript to do this (which you can then trigger as a keyboard shortcut from the tool of your choice; I use QuickSilver), but I haven't found it yet (I'm no AppleScript junkie).
