Can I upgrade an iPhone from iOS 4 to to iOS 5 now that iOS 6 has come out? <body> If I have an iPhone running iOS 4 that I want to run iOS 5, but don't want to lose Google Maps by upgrading to iOS 6, is this possible?  <answer64742> You can still download the IPSW files that contain iOS from Apple - here's a list of all of them. Just find the correct 5.1.1 file for your model.  The problem is installing that IPSW. The trick to make iTunes use a specific IPSW instead of downloading the latest from Apple is to hold option (shift on Windows) while clicking the Update or Restore buttons. There is a limit to how long Apple will allow installations of old versions (without using jailbreak-related hacks), so you'll want to try this ASAP.  <comment76081> Once you have a working restore set - be sure not to accept the upgrade offer and keep that file around. You should be able to restore the device at the same level going forward. <comment76450> And, FWIW, the window seems to be closed.
