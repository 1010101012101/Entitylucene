iOS 9.3 offline dictation not working <body> I have an iPad Pro 12.9 and an iPhone 6s, both have "hey siri" enabled, along with dictation. However I can't get the offline dictation to show up. I initially thought it was because I live in Italy (but I have everything set to US English), so I tried wiping the iPad and just setting up everything without logging in to any Apple account. I set the location to USA and the language to US English, but I still can't get offline dictation. Any suggestions?  <answer255877> strongI think I solved this!!!!/strong  I have an iPhone 6s+ and iPad Pro, neither of which allowed offline dictation.  For some reason, strongthe language package which allows your iPhone 6s(+) or iPad Pro to do offline dictation appears to be downloaded emalongside/em of any of emSiri's/em English dialects/strong.  Discovered this semi-accidentally. I had a weird-and-shouldn't-work epiphany this morning. I had an American English keyboard but prefer Siri's British voice. I wondered if it would only download if the keyboard preference and Siri dialect were the same. Changed the dialect to American English (which I had to download), restarted the phone, and viola, offline dictation was enabled.  Tried the same on my iPad, but it didn't work.   But then I realized that Siri's American English was already loaded on my iPad, so I tried downloading the Australian dialect, and voila!, offline dictation was now enabled.  strongIt appears that downloading any English dialect for Siri will also download the offline dictation package./strong  Good luck!  <comment304079> BTW, Apple Pay and News are available (since I set it up as a US iPad, but no offline dictation). These are not available in Italy, they only pop up when I set the region to USA.
