Where is my .bash_profile located? (Mac OS 10.10.5) <body> Disclamer: I am a newbie to UNIX programming.  I downloaded Anaconda but then realized that I did not need it. I deleted and uninstalled it as fully as I could find out how. It seems that everything to do with Anaconda is gone except that the $PATH variable retains paths to folders which no longer exist.  In the terminal when I type   precodeecho $PATH /code/pre  It returns  code/Users/Name/anaconda/bin://anaconda/bin:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/opt/X11/bin:/usr/texbin/code  How do I remove the Anaconda path? I know that I have to change the .bash_profile, but strongwhere exactly is the file located in Mac OS/strong?   Two additional side questions:  1) is the 'Python.framework' path part of the built in Mac python distribution, or is that related to Anaconda as well?  2) what is the /opt/X11/bin related to in the path?  <answer250203> You can edit bash profile with codevi ~/.bash_profile/code make sure the PATH was not added in code~/.bashrc/code or to code/etc/profile/code  To remove the PATH you can either remove it from the file where it was added, or simply re export the ones you need codeexport PATH=/here/is/one:/here/is/another/code  <comment310567> Should be in the home folder  `/Users/Name/`. But may also be called `.profile`. If you don't see it in finder, you may have to enable seeing hidden files. <comment310568> And to remove the path `export PATH=/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/opt/X11/bin:/usr/texbin` (I don't know where the `;` and the `&#‌​47` comes from, I don't see when editing the comment)
