Apple TV 3 and H264 MKV playback? <body> I am debating on purchasing the WD LIVE or Apple TV 3. And I wanted to know if it is possible that the ATV can do .mkv and .avi playback on non-itunes media. (i.e. pulling it from my server)  <answer124712> AppleTV does not have native support for mkv files. You can use various third-party programs to transcode and send to AppleTV, ranging from the simple (Beamer) to the full library solutions (Plex combined with PlexConnect).  <answer135981> From strongApple Discussion/strong, I found the following explanation:  emThe first thing to know or has well known is that there are only two official and free methods to stream video files to Apple TV from computer: iTunes or AirPlay. Unfortunately, neither of the two supports MKV as the input format. Likewise, you'll be greatly disappointed if you turn to other alternatives since most of them are not only expensive but also have inevitable defects: only support several formats, require installing some plug-ins, and with an endless line of embedded goods, etc./em  emTo successfully stream MKV or HD MKV to Apple TV, here, I strongly recommend to convert MKV to Apple TV as well as iTunes and AirPlay supported formats./em  <comment244685> An alternative to beamer for Windows is PopCast (http://www.popcastapp.com/).

I used Plex Media Server streaming to Apple TV for years and it worked great.
