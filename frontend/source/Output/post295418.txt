Ergonomics: fingers to use to press Cmd and Opt keys at the same time <body> I find myself struggling with keyboard shorts that require pressing Cmd and Opt at the same time. I have been using my third and fourth fingers on my left hand press Command and Option respectively, but this means for Cmd-Opt-S, I have to use my right hand to press S.   I also tried using the thumb but sometimes I miss either the Cmd or Opt.   What is the preferred way to execute such keyboard shortcuts?  <answer295421> When I need to hit kbdcommand/kbd and either kbdcontrol/kbd or kbdoption/kbd,I generally use my left middle and fore fingers, sometimes middle and thumb, sometimes pinky and thumb.  However, it's not especially often I end up needing more than one modifier key at the same time (ie, I usually only need kbdcommand/kbd or kbdoption/kbd or kbdcontrol/kbd with another key - not together).  <comment372997> There's no preferred way to press key combinations - it's what works for ***you***.  Is there something that you're having difficulty with that it's not feasible for you?  If so, please detail so we can address a specific objective problem. <comment373000> Try your thumb and fourth finger. But ultimately this is entirely subjective and will likely depend on whatever key you press in combination, as well as the physical layout (spacing) of your specific keyboard.
