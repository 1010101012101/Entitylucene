Is there a way to disable passwords for free apps on iPhone 4? <body> Under codeSettings &gt; iTunes &amp; App Store/code there is no codePassword Settings/code option for me on my newly activated iPhone 4. From reading this article, it seems this might be a bug and that I have to turn off Touch ID to access this setting. But iPhone 4 has no touch id. The hardware isn't there, nor is the software.  How can I turn off password prompting for free apps? Is there any way?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GCgfv.png" width="280"   <comment299168> Can you please add a screenshot of your `iTunes & App Store - Password Settings` screen?  It seems very strange that you don't have that option. <comment299176> As requested. Kind of a huge screenshot but oh well. <comment299186> What do you see when you go to 'Settings - Passcode'?
