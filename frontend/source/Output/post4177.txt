"not supported on this architecture" error (git) <body> I'm trying to install the Gitx Git client on my friend's mac and it seems to install fine but when I run it I get the following error:    You cannot open the application "GitXStable" because it is not supported on this architecture.  Ideas?  <answer4179> Intel application on a PowerPC Mac. Or vice versa. See if you can find an "Universal Binary" version of the application, which will run on either platform.  This link has a Universal Binary version: http://frim.frim.nl/GitXStable.app.zip  <answer4189> I recommend you to use this version of GitX. Here is the direct link to download. Supported architectures are strongppc7400, i386, x86_64./strong  <comment3999> It would be great if you tell us the Operating System and Macâ€™s model of your friend, our crystal balls are out of battery ;)
