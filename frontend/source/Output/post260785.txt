MacBook Air (Early 2015) Network Driver for Linux <body> I got an unexpected question when installing a Debian Based Linux on my Late 2015 MacBook Air:  precodeDetect network hardware  No Ethernet card was detected. If you know the name of the driver needed by your Ethernet cars, you can select it from the list. /code/pre  The list is huge.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IsiuP.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Some of the notable names are:  ul lirtl8723ae: Realtek 8723e 802.11ax PCI wireless/li lib43legacy: Broadcom 4400 10/100 PCI Ethernet /li liadm8211: Driver for IEEE 802.11b wireless cards based on ADMtek ADM8211/li /ul  I would restart and try to find information in it, but the installation was failing before ( tried more than 10 times), and it is working now. I don't wanna take any chances.  This is the only information I found in Apple's website :     Wireless: 802.11ac Wi-Fi wireless networking; IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n   compatible   What is the right driver? Thanks!  <answer260809> There is no such thing as a late 2015 MacBook Air model. I'm assuming you have the early 2015 model.  In that case your computer has a Broadcom BCM4360 chipset for WiFi.  The driver you would need in debian is the "wl" driver. You will probably need to install the broadcom-sta-dkms package manually and then load the wl driver.  The driver is non-free/binary-only so probably not listed during installation.
