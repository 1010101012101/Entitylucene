Safari extension for timed automagical tab switching. Does it exist? Can I create one? <body> I can't find any extension that allows me to switch between open tabs every x seconds..... Before I 'dive' into extension development I have to ask....:  ul liIs there a limitation in Safari's extensions system which would block the development of an auto tab switcher?/li /ul  <answer272392> This should be possible. The extension API gives you access to the SafariBrowserTab class, which allows you to activate a specific tab in a specific window. So adding an extension toolbar button that started/stopped the looped switching should be pretty straightforward.  <comment342709> Thnx. Turns out it was very straightforward indeed. Took me a couple of hours to get what I need.
