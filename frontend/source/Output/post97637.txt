Problem migrating mailboxes to Mountain Lion <body> I have just set up a new mac and migrated the user accounts from the old system (Snow Leopard) to the new one (Mountain Lion) and everything went well except for some parts of the Mail setup.  In the old computer there were several mailbox (.mbox) directories on the Mac itself.  These mailboxes were transferred to the new computer and it looks like they were successfully processed by the migration into a new directory structure.  However the mailboxes do not show up in the new Mail program.  (Note that the mbox's directly related to the email POP accounts did successfully transfer to the new mac)  For example, there is a mailbox called Travel and for a particular email message it is located in the old and new systems as:  precode/Users/oldmac/Library/Mail/Mailboxes/Travel.mbox/Messages/24307.emlx /Users/newmac/Library/Mail/V2/Mailboxes/Travel.mbox/A24F8F9F-8AEC-4802-9FF9-10A497A5352D/Data/4/2/Messages/24307.emlx /code/pre  And the text in 24307.emlx in the new location matches that of the old location.  So the question is how do I get these local mbox folders to appear in the Mail app?  Do I have to manually configure something under the hood, or is there a user configuration somewhere that I have missed?  <answer98321> Have you tried doing like this?  ol liNavigate to: Macintosh HD → Users → Your User Folder → Library./li liNow you need to copy the Mail folder, as shown below. (Yes, the entire folder.)/li liYou should also copy the preferences file for Mail.app. Here's where you can find it: Macintosh HD → Users → Your User Folder → Library → Preferences. The name of the file is com.apple.mail.plist./li liCopy the Mail folder and the preferences file to the Library and Preferences folder. Make sure that the folder and file are in the correct location!/li /ol  Source:  http://www.macinstruct.com/node/183  <answer98635> OK .. I solved my problem and it is a combination of face palm plus a generous serving of hating Apple.  This was what I was seeing in the Mail app after the migration, and there was nothing I could see in the preferences that would tell me how to display the files that I knew were in the correct location.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bOYJF.png" alt="enter image description here"  Then by total fluke I moused over the "On My Mac" label and saw:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NoRip.png" alt="enter image description here"  Which revealed the stronghidden/strong setting which I can't even see mentioned in the help file.  When I click on codeShow/code I finally see what I have been looking for:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HkhWk.png" alt="enter image description here"  Maybe its a pebkac error for not memorising 100% of the Mail apps features, but Apple sure doesn't make it an obvious UI element or mention it anywhere strongI/strong can find.  <comment115401> Answers on Ask Different need to be more than just a link. It's okay to include a link, but please summarize or excerpt it in the answer. The idea is to make the answer stand alone. <comment115402> Understood, I've made an edit with a summarized version of the links content <comment115443> @AndreasNorman    As mentioned in my question, the mail folders already have been copied to the new computer as a part of the migration.  The problem is getting the mail app to recognize them. <comment115556> did you copy the com.apple.mail.plist file? or is it too late for that?
