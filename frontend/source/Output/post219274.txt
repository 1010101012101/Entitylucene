Is there any way to boot from my BootCamp Partition after installing Ubuntu MATE? <body> So I've been running BootCamp on a 13-Inch Late 2007 MacBook for a while now using these instructions and everything was working fine. (Of course, I still have my Mac Partition.)  However, yesterday I decided to try Ubuntu MATE via DVD and installed it to my internal hard drive.  But the problem is, when I hit the Option Key during startup and select "Windows" it boots up into the Ubuntu MATE operating system instead of Windows.  Is there any way to boot up into my Windows Partition again, or did this overwrite my partition? I'd rather have Ubuntu MATE as its own choice in the startup disk menu (the one I mentioned in the last paragraph.)
