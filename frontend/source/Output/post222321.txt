Is there a way to extend the desktop by default when a new display is connected? <body> Whenever I connect a new monitor, projector, or TV to an Apple laptop, the new display by default mirrors the existing desktop.  If a number of applications are open, you may get documents that were only visible in background coming to foreground for everyone to see. And usually these displays have a different aspect ratio to the laptop screen, which results in any open applications being resized. When moving between locations often this becomes a real pain.  Is there a way to extend the desktop by default, rather than mirror the display, when a new display is connected?
