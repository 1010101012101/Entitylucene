How do you extend the time required to trigger hot corner actions? <body> I like the concept of hot corner actions but the trigger time for hot corner actions is too quick for me to make good use of them. I keep tripping my corner actions accidentally while reaching for objects in that general vicinity of the corner.  Is it possible to extend the trigger time for hot corner actions? So I have to hover in the corner for at least a second or two before the hot corner action triggers?  <answer40242> I do not know how do delay the triggering, but you can strongadd modifier keys/strong to the hot corners in order to avoid accidental activation:  Hold down kbd&#x2318;/kbd,kbd&#x2325;/kbd,kbd&#x21E7;/kbd or kbdctrl/kbd while selecting an option from the list.img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eumFr.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment45502> Curse you gentmatt! I was just writing the same answer! :( (Related: SE's "new answer posted" notice is really helpful. I ultimately didn't waste the time on an answer someone else already gave.) <comment45504> Haha! There will be more races for the first answer in the future... :)
