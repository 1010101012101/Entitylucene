Spilt one huge PDF into separate .txt files <body> I have a PDF file of 2 years worth of journal entries that were exported from MacJournal back in 2009. I now use Day One, which allows CLI to import .txt files.  My question is, is it possible to export a PDF of formatted entries (with date) into individual .txt files of each entry separated (with the file name of month/Day/Year.txt)?  <answer124542> Try to first use codepdftotext/code or codeebook-convert/code to convert the PDF to text:  precodebrew install poppler;pdftotext file.pdf  /Applications/calibre.app/Contents/MacOS/ebook-convert file.pdf file.txt /code/pre  Then if for example the text file has a format like this:  precode2012-12-31 paragraph 1 paragraph 2  2013-01-01 paragraph 1 paragraph 2 /code/pre  Try running a command like this:  precodeawk -v RS= -F'\n' '{print $0&gt;($1".txt")}' file.txt /code/pre  Or if the text file has a format like this:  precode2012-12-31  paragraph 1  paragraph 2   2013-01-01  paragraph 1  paragraph 2 /code/pre  Try running a command like this:  precoderuby -e '$&lt;.read.split("\n\n\n").each{|s|title,content=s.split("\n\n",2) File.open(title+".txt","w"){|f|f.puts content}}' input.txt /code/pre
