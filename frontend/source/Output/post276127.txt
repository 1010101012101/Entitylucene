How to remove items in the "Open dictionary" window of MacOS Script Editor? <body> There are some items in the dictionary that I can't find in the Window - Resource Library. Actually they are all one application I created with Automator but for some reason appeared multiple times here. It looks annoying. Is there a way to delete them? img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/G6Uhi.png" alt="enter image description here"
