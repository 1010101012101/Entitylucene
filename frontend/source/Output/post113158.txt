Is bookmark sync biderectional in iCloud for Windows? <body> The new version of iCloud Control Panel for Windows (3.0) allows syncing bookmarks with Chrome, Firefox and IE.  I was wondering, is this syncing bidirectional? As in, if I bookmark something on Chrome on Windows, is this new bookmark going to be pushed to iCloud and Safari on iOS and OS X?  <answer113174> As Apple explains it here it seems to be a 2-way sync. This article on http://freakyworld.net/ confirms that.   <comment132839> Thanks for the FreakyWorld link. I did see the Apple page, but it wasn't clear enough for me whether is works both ways.
