Is there a free program to join and cut AVI movie files? <body> I have a camera and it creates an AVI file every 10 minutes when recording video. I would like to join files from the camera and sometime trim part of the video. I don't want re-encode the files if possible.  Is there a free program that will let me concatenate a split AVI files?  <answer114727> AVITools is trialware, but all it does is nag you and limit you to one job at a time.  MPEG Streamclip is another free Mac app that, despite the name, can mux together AVI, MPEG, MKV, and other sorts of video files into one big file.  And there's always good old FFMPEG, but it isn't quite as user-friendly as the above.  <answer114780> You can also use the codeconcat/code demuxer with ffmpeg:  precodeffmpeg -f concat -i &lt;(for f in $PWD/*.avi;do echo "file '$f'";done) -c copy output.avi /code/pre  code-c copy/code disables re-encoding the streams.  You can install ffmpeg with codebrew install ffmpeg/code after installing Homebrew.  See https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/How%20to%20concatenate%20%28join,%20merge%29%20media%20files for more information.  <comment134398> HI. I didn't test AVITools before, but it is simply and is what I want, so I paid the 6 USD! Mpeg Streamclip didn't open (I am with Lion) and FFMPEG only give-me headache. I have tried it before, but the result wasn't good. Pay was faster than learn how to do the correct way. <comment134399> before ask it, I read this answer. Didn't work, the command line result in a avi file with index problem. Anyway, AVITools do what I want and solve my problem.
