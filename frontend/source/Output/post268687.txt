OS X Mountain Lion's Gatekeeper rejecting app signed on El Capitan <body> I am signing an OS X app using my codeDeveloper ID Application certificate/code; it is a self-hosted app. The build server is an codeEl Capitan/code machine (code10.11.6/code).  The app passes validation on codeMavericks/code, codeYosemite/code, codeEl Capitan/code and codeSierra/code. However, on codeMtn Lion/code I am informed that the app has been damaged or tampered and I get the option to send it to Trash. Sure enough, a codecodesign -dv /Applications/Whatever.app/code shows the same result. Trying to install codeRB App Checker Lite/code, I am informed that this old OS is not supported, and I was unable to find an older version, to see whether it would show me more details.    Is this behavior normal / documented anywhere?     I do know that codeMavericks/code introduced a new type of signature, and codeMtn Lion's/code codeGatekeeper/code is expecting a codev1/code. I couldn't find anything more relevant than an old (2014) announcement from Apple, regarding Mac App Store submission rules changes:  codeBeginning November 1, 2014, apps submitted to the Mac App Store must be signed with signatures created with OS X Mavericks 10.9 or later (v2 signatures). Apps without v2 signatures will be automatically rejected on upload./code  code[...]/code  codeApps signed with v2 signatures will work on older versions of OS X./code  If there is something I am missing and/or a workaround, I would gladly acknowledge and act on / adopt it, instead of asking customers to alter security settings on their Macs. Thank you.
