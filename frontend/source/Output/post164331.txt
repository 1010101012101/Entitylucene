I don't have administrator account on my mac <body> On my mac I have 2 accounts and the both are normal account. So in this moment I don't have a Administrator account, only one that was in the past a administrator, but now is not.  How I can have again a Administrator account?   <answer164332> You can create a new administrator account by restarting the Setup Assistant:  ol liBoot into Single User Mode kbd⌘/kbd + kbdS/kbd./li liMount the drive by typing code/sbin/mount -uw //code then kbd↩ enter/kbd./li liRemove the Apple Setup Done file by typing coderm /var/db/.AppleSetupDone/code then kbd↩ enter/kbd./li liReboot by typing codereboot/code then kbd↩ enter/kbd./li liComplete the setup process, creating a new admin account./li /ol  <answer164333> Boot off the recovery partition, open up terminal, and type  precoderesetpassword /code/pre  That should bring up a dialog that will allow you to change your password and, maybe, set the account to admin. If you cannot set an account to admin, then you will need to reboot into single user mode (hold kbdCmd-S/kbd while starting up your Mac). When you get to the command line (black screen, white text) type:  precodemount -uw / rm /var/db/.AppleSetupDone /code/pre  This makes the file system writeable, and then removes the file that tells OS X that you've setup the system. Hit kbdCtrl-D/kbd" to continue your boot and you should get the "Welcome to Macintosh" startup and you will be able to setup a NEW account (make sure it is a new account). This account will be an admin account.  <answer164335> You can boot your Mac into single user mode by holding kbdCmd-S/kbd key while the system startup  ol limount when read &amp; write mode codemount -uw //code/li liyou can create admin group and account by using codedscl/code utility /li /ol  PS: This procedure does require you to type a fair number of commands, you can alternatively use the OS X setup assistant for recreating the admin account. To do so, after booting to Single User mode and setting the file system for write access (see above), then run the following command:  coderm /var/db/.AppleSetupDone/code  <comment192657> How did the account become a non admin one? <comment192679> Might be worth going into the user/accounts settings page and seeing if the account that "was" admin can be set back to being admin w/ the rights you currently have.  I wasn't aware that OSX allowed you to de-admin all accounts. <comment193739> nelson, I suggest improving your answer by adding the actual dscl commands that he would need to use.  Good response but it could be better.  I had a hell of a time recently myself trying to figure it out, a good answer on this site would have helped immensely. <comment267064> I used this page recently after I accidentally made myself a standard user - http://www.hackmac.org/tutorials/from-standard-to-administrator/ <comment341718> The answers in this question don't work for me.
