Alfred command: switch finder directory in same window <body> I am an avid user of the launch application Alfred. I already have key bindings to open specific directories but when initiated, they always open the directory in a new finder window.  Im looking for a method to change the directory of the existing finder window rather than opening a new one. Im open to native or workflow-based solutions.   Any help or ideas are appreciated.  <answer157218> You could do it installing this workflow: Open in Finder Tab.  Just type codeot Directory/code and you will have it open on a new Finder tab.  hr  If you want to open a directory in the same window without open a new tab, you could edit the workflow. Go to Alfred Preferences → Workflows → Open in Finder Tab.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WjjEh.png" alt="enter image description here"  You must right click on Run Script and select configure.

I actually have my system configured to _not_ use tabs… effectively this seems to be the same function just presented a little differently. I would like to actually _change_ the current directory with whatever directory I launch from alfred. Is there a system level conflict of some sort that prevents my desired functionality? <comment185012> That is fantastic! A **BIG** thank you! My use of alfred grows by the day and this was a big obstacle in my daily workflow. Unfortunately I dont have enough rep here to give you an upvote… but thank you again.
