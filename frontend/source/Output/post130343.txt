MBPr 2012 15 in. Problem Diagnosing Problem <body> There's a problem with my macbook and I don't know how to replicate it. I have a good feeling that the problem stems from overheating but I don't have a solid way of showing it if I were to take it to applecare. I play video games, recently Titanfall, on my retina in bootcamp with my friend who has almost the exact same macbook as me (all the specs are identical except I have 16 gb of ram) but I experience wildly fluctuating frame rates (even on the lowest settings) and he doesn't. By fluctuating, I mean that the laptop will keep jumping between 20 and 60 fps and occasionally drop down to 7-10 for 4-5 seconds before recovering for a minute and then dropping very low again. It seemed like I'm hitting a frame limit caused by overheating but when I check the temperatures, the CPU core is the highest around 77 C which isn't even that bad. It makes playing anything unbearable. I've updated all my graphics cards, tried SMC, VRAM, reinstall, everything I could think of but the problem still persists. Did anybody else have this problem? If not, does anyone know how I can show the apple clerk what's wrong?  Thanks!  <comment152762> Are you playing the game interactively over your network? <comment152764> Yes I am playing over the network but it isn't network lag. I've seen that before in the game and it often involves a disparity between the data the game receives and the actions the game simulates. This isn't what causes the strange frame rates. Also, I have an fps counter which shouldn't drop from network lag. <comment152806> Have you checked your "Energy Saver" settings in System Preferences? <comment152842> Ya, its on performance.
