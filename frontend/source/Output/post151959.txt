How can I change some of the system default preferences used for the guest and new user accounts? <body> I have an shared OSX machine (now running Yosemite) that is used by a large group of people, most of which are not normally Mac users. A couple of the most regulars such as myself that need persistent storage have accounts of our own with things costomized the way we like them. Anybody else sitting down at the machine uses the guest account and everything is nuked when they logout.  This arrangement works pretty well, but the system default settings used for the guest account are less than ideal. For one thing the mouse is absurdly slow and needs speeding up just to stay on the table trying to get across the screen. There are also some language and keyboard settings that frequently get set even for temporary use.  ol liHow can I set values in System Preferences in such a way that they will be the base system default and get used for guest logins?/li liAdditionally is it possible to coustomize the default dock contents to make it easier on users unfamiliar with OSX to find the apps they need access to on this system?/li /ol  <answer173595> First of all you may need to unhide the hiden files so open terminal and run those commands :  precodedefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE  killall Finder /code/pre  To switch back, do the same but substitute FALSE for TRUE.   Now  Login to your guest account, there set chrome as your default browser (or even Firefox)  Then do not logout ! This would erase your session, so use the  on the top right corner use the swich user drop down menue,  Now that you are back again in your Admin account, Find the new temporary guest home folder, under    precode Users/Guest /code/pre  Select all the folders inside of it, And copy them in :   precode /System/Library/User Template/English.lproj/     /code/pre  English or whatever your languish is if you are using your computer in french this should be :  precode  /System/Library/User Template/French.lproj/     /code/pre  as you can see in this folder there was the defaults folders for the guest account  By modifying them you have just modified default appearance of the guest user account You may want to save this folder in a safe place before, in case you want to undo your work.
