use iPhone/iPod touch Wifi through Opera turbo <body> I'm a boarder at a school and some sites are blocked. I normally access these sites via Opera Turbo on my MacBook, but on the iPhone I can only use it via the Opera app.   strongIs there any way to route this though the WiFi settings so iPhone/iPod apps will use the internet via Opera Turbo?/strong  <comment181160> Are you using the Opera Mini ? <comment181161> The Turbo mode might not be allowed by your ISP. <comment181165> Opera Turbo works fine on my iPod and Macbook - and yes, I am using the Opera Mini, but I want to make it universally available on my iPod so other apps can use Opera Turbo/Mini
