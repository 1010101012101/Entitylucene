Is there any audio splitter applications? <body> As I know,  there are many audio splitter software like GoldWave on the Windows platform. But I cannot find any similar applications for Mac Os.  What I want is an audio splitter which can  ol liautomatically split the audio file according to its wave, that is, it can recognize the pause automatically;/li lisplit the audio according to its lyric file./li /ol  Do you have any suggestions? I do not like to install a Windows along with OS X to use such software.  <answer248964> Audacity is available for Mac and can do many audio editing functions, though I'm not sure about "split the audio according to its lyric file".  <comment308651> [GarageBand](http://www.apple.com/mac/garageband/) doesn't do what you are looking for? <comment309079> @Allan I have GarageBand installed, but I cannot find the way to do the things in the question. Could you post it as an answer if you have any idea? I'll be very appreciate! <comment309080> Thanks! I know Audacity, but I cannot find the way to do the things in the question. Could you explain it in details? I'll be very appreciate!
