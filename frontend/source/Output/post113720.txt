What is the highest resolution external display that can be supported by a late 2012 13in MacBook Pro <body> What is the highest resolution external display that can be supported by a late 2012 retina 13in MacBook Pro?  It's got a 2.5ghz i5 processor and 8gb of ram and the Intel HD Graphics 4000 w 768mb.  And I'm running OS X 10.8.5 (12F45)  In particular I'm wondering if it can drive ultra hd or UHD  3840 Ã— 2160.  <answer113724> If you are talking about the non-Retina version, then the highest it can go is 2560 x 1600 pixels for one display. (Source (under "Graphics and Video Support")).  If you are talking about the Retina version, then it can also go up to 2560 x 1600 pixels, but up to two displays. (Source (under "Graphics and Video Support"))  Conclusion: you should still be able to use the display in question, but your Mac will only let your monitor go up to 2560 x 1600.  <answer148815> Here is the official link that says that you can connect a 4k monitor but at 30HZ, and on some setups (e.g. macbook pro retina late 2013) at 60HZ  http://support.apple.com/kb/ht6008  Also, the support article on thunderbolt FAQ is relevant to what monitors can be driven at high resolutions:  http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3382#11  <answer247797> This program allows to list all supported resolutions and switch to highest one http://specialmeaning.blogspot.com/2016/07/yes-apple-i-did-it.html  <comment133413> I wouldn't be surprised if some monitors worked well past the "supported" limit, but it's also dicey going out of support as sometimes there are real glitches and errors. Especially if the op is ok tweaking the driver settings on OS X. Well have to see with Mavericks and new displays coming out whether 10.8 gets drivers for monstrous pixel counts as well.
