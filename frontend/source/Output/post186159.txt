Is there a limit to how big a Photos library can be? <body> I have a 250gb Photos library on an external harddrive. Recently Photos has begun to crash after about 15-30 seconds of use. Every time.   I haven't been able to find any info on why. This thread suggests that it is choking on movies, and I have a lot of movies. https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6985998  Is there an upper limit to how big a Photos library can be?   <comment219773> That thread seems to be in relation to choking during _import_ of movies, not necessarily operation. How many items do you have in your library? There is no published upper limit. <comment220193> My Photos library is around 500GB and it works alright (slow, but seldom crashes). I don't have a lot of videos though (maybe 5%) <comment223493> I have 30,000 items. Probably 20% movies by #, 60% movies by size.
