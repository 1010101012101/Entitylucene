The benefit here is you pre-emotively disable the connection as opposed to reacting to each single device after an app has launched and the specific device is connected.  <comment202595> Interestingly this works also with Android devices (tested with Yosemite). <comment258606> Can anyone test this in El Capitan? I've run out of 'foreign' devices to test with. <comment258847> This unfortunately no longer works as of 10.11 "El Capitan". <comment258853> @NicholasH. Hmm - it works for me. Are you sure you are using `defaults -currentHost write` ? I've tested this now on two builds of 10.11 and it's working for me. <comment280185> Also relevant is http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/188212/prevent-photos-app-on-osx-yosemite-from-starting-when-plugging-in-device
