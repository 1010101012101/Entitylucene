Can I backup an arbitrary file on iCloud? <body> If I open iCloud in System Preferences, it says I have 5 GB of storage available.  I'd like to use it to back up some zip archives of source code.  Is that possible, or can you only access that storage through specific programs?  strongUpdate/strong - I've accepted the answer about the emMobile Backups/em folder, but I it is not quite what I want for a backup system, so I'm not going to use iCloud for this. If I delete a file from Mobile Backups, it will disappear from the iCloud folder, but I want protection from accidental deletion.  I want plain old file storage.   <answer122535> Yes you can — iCloud can be used to sync anything that you wish.  ol liOpen strong~/Library/Mobile Documents/strong and create a folder (call it anything you wish)./li liInside, put whatever documents you would like to sync over iCloud./li liThat folder will sync with other Macs (and jailbroken iOS devices, and on the web too if you have a Apple Developer licence)./li /ol  Alternatively, you can symlink a folder on your Mac in to the Mobile Documents folder so that the files remain in their original location.  <comment142972> Lots of threads here discuss accessing the Mobile Documents folder hidden in ~/Library. http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/61607 and http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/55366/ <comment143007> If I don't have another Mac, or a dev license (yet), how can I tell that the file is backed up?  If I remove the file from Mobile Documents, does that remove it from the backups? <comment143017> @Rob I don't know — that might be worth a separate question as that applies to files uploaded by normal methods through apps as well. <comment143040> @Rob Sorry didn't address your second part to your comment: yes it does — the Mobile Documents folder equals the contents of Documents & Data on iCloud. <comment143252> I'm unsure about accepting your answer.  You said "yes", but then you described something that, to me, is not really a backup.  I mean: if I link a file to Mobile Documents, with the goal of backing it up, and then I accidentally delete that file, and then the system "syncs" this by deleting the file from the iCloud... that's not a backup!  Do you agree? <comment143254> @Rob The symlinking solution is mainly so that if your computer 'dies' you can recover the file on a new install/computer — it provides no help against accidental deletion. For a more traditional solution, see the first part to my answer. You can copy the file to iCloud, then recover it later. <comment143255> Am I correct that there is no list of these files in the web interface to iCloud?  So if my computer is lost or destroyed, to recover the file, I have to buy another Mac, and the file will show up in Mobile Documents, correct? <comment143257> @Rob This is true (although the *developer* web interface includes full access to the contents of the folder) <comment143258> @Rob …including the free Safari developer account <comment143263> Ah, okay. I just signed up for Safari dev. Re-signed into icloud. I don't see anything new. Where does the list show up? <comment143264> let us [continue this discussion in chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/13324/discussion-between-grgarside-and-rob-n) <comment164211> Yosemite or iOS8 Release - there will be online Storage (Storage no [Backup](http://17799-news.the-hamster.com/issue08-news7.htm))
