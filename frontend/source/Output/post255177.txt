Locking cells in numbers <body> Is there an easy way to lock individual cells or a group of cells in Numbers to prevent the data in the cell from being changed?    <answer255186> The short answer is, no, however you can lock a table.  ul liTo lock a Table, select it and then, from the Menu bar, click: Arrange  Lock/li /ul  The longer answer is, if you want to protect a cell or concurrent group of cells, do the following:  ul liOverlay the target cell or concurrent group of cells with a rectangular shape./li liOpen the Inspector, click the Graphic tab, move the Opacity slider all the way to the left (0%)./li liLock the shape in place, from the Menu bar, click: Arrange  Lock/li /ul  This allows the contents of the cell or concurrent group of cells to be seen but not able to be modified unless the graphic shape is unlocked and either moved out of the way manually, set it to the back from the Arrange menu or remove it.  To relock the cell or concurrent group of cells bring the graphic shape back to the front from the Arrange menu or manually move it back, if it was moved, and then lock it again the Arrange menu.  <comment317772> +1 for the transparent object tip.
