How can I sync Reading List with Windows? <body> Is it possible to use Safari's Reading List on my Windows machine and have it synced with the one on my Mac/iOS devices?  <answer28080> According to Apple's support docs, Safari 5.1.1 for Windows will sync the Reading List via iCloud.      Safari 5.1.1 includes support for iCloud, a breakthrough set of free cloud services. iCloud stores your Safari bookmarks and Safari Reading List and automatically pushes them to all your devices.   I believe you would need to have Safari up to date. Then, install the iCloud Windows control panel and configure it to sync Safari content.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uG52n.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Then, enable iCloud on all of your Mac/iOS devices, and you should be good to go.   <comment32215> Excellent, works. Thank you <comment35528> yes, but iCloud isn't supported for Windows XP :( <comment35531> Count yourself lucky, iCloud is not supported on Snow Leopard which came out less than 2 years ago... :-) <comment110790> Windows XP was released in 2001! (years before Facebook existed and at time when Mac users were using OS 10.1 Puma!!!) Time to move on people...
