Unexpected interfaces in ifconfig <body> In the middle of installing a tool called mrtg, I bailed out from a perl script to set various configuration parameters for use of snmp because it became clear that I had no idea what I was doing.  I also explored some snmp commands myself, but didn't keep a record, unfortunately.  I come back to ifconfig and notice it shows three new interfaces (not there just before the previous adventure):  precodegif0: flags=8010&lt;POINTOPOINT,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1280 stf0: flags=0&lt;&gt; mtu 1280 fw0: flags=8863&lt;UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 4078     lladdr 60:fb:42:ff:fe:f4:cd:9e      media: autoselect &lt;full-duplex&gt;     status: inactive /code/pre  My laptop on the same LAN has a different new interface called p2p0 that I hadn't noticed before, as well as gif0 and stf0 but not fw0.  After I reset my Airport Extreme to factory default, and reinstalled OS X Lion on my machine, with a wiped disk, they are still there.  This:  precodesudo ifconfig gif0 destroy /code/pre  makes gif0 go away, but on reboot it comes back.  There is a previous answer with some info but what I'd like to know is why are they still there despite a clean install, could they be a security risk, and should I or can I make them go away.  Should I be looking at the Airport or something in my StartupItems?  UPDATE:  Does my machine set these up at boot or does the Airport remember them?  And in either case, why didn't a clean install (or factory reset) restore them to the previous configuration?  <answer47480> The gif0 is a generic virtual interface, stf0 is an ipv6 interface and fw0 is your firewire interface. You shouldn't worry about these.  <answer47481> codefw0/code is the FireWire network interface. It's benign.  codestf0/code is an IPv6 to IPv4 tunnel interface. It's a bridge connection that exits to help us transition from IPv4 to the IPv6 standard. It's benign. You can read more about it here if you like: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6to4  codegif0/code is a generic tunnel interface. It's used to tunnel IPv4 traffic to an IPv6 network and back. It's benign.

FWIW, fiddling with Network Prefs does not change output of a plain ifconfig (including deleting FireWire as shown in the answer.  A change to the IPv6 configuration in Network Prefs is reversed by a reboot. <comment54428> @telliott99 thanks. Edited. <comment105102> I have a `p2p0`. Any explanations? <comment105160> If it has an IPv6 address in the block fe80::/64 it's a local link interface. <comment160431> I have never installed VirtualBox but I have this interface in my Macbook Pro. <comment208587> According to https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4784003 p2p0 is AirDrop, not VirtualBox <comment208605> While this link may answer the question, it is better to include the essential parts of the answer here and provide the link for reference.
