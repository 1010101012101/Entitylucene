If I upgrade to lion, will FCS 2 still work? <body> I've noticed that a lot of different people have been asking, "If I upgrade to lion, will emthis/em program work?". So I guess lion isn't very compatible? Here's my question: Will FCS 2 work with lion? FCS 2 includes:  ul liFinal Cut Pro 6/li liMotion 3/li liColor 1/li liSoundtrack Pro 3/li liDVD Studio Pro 3/li liCompressor 3/li /ul  br / Don't tell me to upgrade to Final Cut X; It is junk compared to this.  <answer26770> As far as I can tell, Final Cut Studio 2 will emrun/em on Lion, but will not eminstall/em on Lion. Apparently, the installer program requires Rosetta, but the software itself does not. So yes, it should work, emif/em it never needs reinstallation, but if it does, you're stuck. Proceed with caution.
