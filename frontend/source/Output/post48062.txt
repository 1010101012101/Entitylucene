Add text substitution for all words ending with certain letters <body> I’d like to have automatic spelling correction in MAC OSX 10.7 for all words ending with certain letter sequences. It would help me a lot in my typing if all words ending with "...ao” were substituted by “ão”, for example.  Is it possible, or do I really have to add every word in Text and Language — Text menu?   <answer48111> What you're looking for is probably a text-replacement suite that supports regular expressions.  They can be cryptic at first but once you learn the syntax, they are extremely powerful.  There was a previous question on another site that netted a product called Find and Replace It which looks appropriate for your usage.
