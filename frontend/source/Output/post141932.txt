Function performed by a shortcut in Pages? <body> I'm writing a lot of text with Pages. Upon typing I'm not always staring at my keyboard and from time to time when using the space bar I inadvertantly type command functions. Most of the time I can easily recover this typing errors by looking at the dynamical 1st entry of the codeEdit/code menu which suggest to undo the wrong command (shortcut kbd⌘/kbd+kbdZ/kbd). But this isn't always possible.  Now I just inadvertantly typed kbd⌘/kbd+kbdE/kbd.  I don't see an immediate and total collapse of my actual page.  But I would like to know if this modified my document somewhere else before saving a damaged document.  How may I find what this shortcut is doing? How may I find what any shortcut is doing?  <answer141933> As far as I know there is not a canonical list of shortcut keys provided by the program in an easy to find way, however, some third party software has cataloged most Apple apps and some others too.  Give Cheat Sheet a try, I think this will answer your question with this program, as well as a great many others.  In short, after installing it, you hold down command, and it gives you a list of shortcuts relevant to the active app.
