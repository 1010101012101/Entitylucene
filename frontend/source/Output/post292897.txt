Disable animation on Docked folders <body> I am running Leopard 10.5.8 on a PowerPC G4, it does not meet the minimum requirements for Leopard (400MHz rather then the "minimum" 867MHz), however it actually runs quite well, it's fairly snappy, and the lower level elements such as Terminal run more smoothly than they did in Tiger. There is only one thing that is negatively impacting performance: certain animations. I have managed to disable most of the offending effects, and the rest don't seem to have any effect on performance, with the exception of one: the open animation on docked folders.  Whenever I try to open my Applications folder I'm stuck waiting for around 5-10 seconds for the grid to pop up. So I'm wondering if there's a way to disable the animations on docked folders so that the grid opens instantly (e.g. like the right-click context menu), so that the last blight on this machine's performance can be eliminated and I can get to work.  (Please no comments or answers telling me to switch back to an older OS X, Leopard was the first version to use several low-level elements that I require from a Unix system, so that is not an option for me.)
