Mail App keeps hanging (not crashing) on Yosemite 10.10.3 <body> Mail runs fine for a few hours, then hangs. I must force quit, then reopen. It runs fine for another few hours then crashes.  This is a fresh install of Yosemite, and I rebuilt the index and tried deleting things people suggest I delete in the library. It redownloaded all the messages already.  Here's the first bit of crash report, which is Greek to me:  precodeDate/Time:       2015-06-10 19:20:29 -0700 OS Version:      10.10.3 (Build 14D136) Architecture:    x86_64 Report Version:  21  Command:         Mail Path:            /Applications/Mail.app/Contents/MacOS/Mail Version:         8.2 (2098) Build Version:   1 Project Name:    Mail Source Version:  2098000000000000 Parent:          launchd [1] PID:             24057  Event:           hang Duration:        3.80s (process was unresponsive for 3984 seconds before sampling) Steps:           39 (100ms sampling interval)  Hardware model:  MacPro3,1 Active cpus:     8  Fan speed:       586 rpm  -------------------------------------------------- Timeline format: stacks are sorted chronologically Use -i and -heavy to re-report with count sorting --------------------------------------------------  Heaviest stack for the main thread of the target process:   39  start + 1 (libdyld.dylib + 13769) [0x7fff8a4c45c9]   39  NSApplicationMain + 1832 (AppKit + 13140) [0x7fff8fadd354]   39  -[NSApplication run] + 594 (AppKit + 551923) [0x7fff8fb60bf3]   39  -[NSApplication nextEventMatchingMask:untilDate:inMode:dequeue:] + 346 (AppKit + 593768) [0x7fff8fb6af68]   39  _DPSNextEvent + 978 (AppKit + 596411) [0x7fff8fb6b9bb]   39  _BlockUntilNextEventMatchingListInModeWithFilter + 71 (HIToolbox + 205099) [0x7fff8c4bf12b]   39  ReceiveNextEventCommon + 431 (HIToolbox + 205546) [0x7fff8c4bf2ea]   39  RunCurrentEventLoopInMode + 235 (HIToolbox + 206191) [0x7fff8c4bf56f]   39  CFRunLoopRunSpecific + 328 (CoreFoundation + 465912) [0x7fff88299bf8]   39  __CFRunLoopDoObservers + 368 (CoreFoundation + 524416) [0x7fff882a8080]   39  __CFRUNLOOP_IS_CALLING_OUT_TO_AN_OBSERVER_CALLBACK_FUNCTION__ + 23 (CoreFoundation + 524583) [0x7fff882a8127]   39  CA::Transaction::observer_callback(__CFRunLoopObserver*, unsigned long, void*) + 71 (QuartzCore + 118553) [0x7fff860fef19]   39  CA::Transaction::commit() + 390 (QuartzCore + 58286) [0x7fff860f03ae]   39  CA::Context::commit_transaction(CA::Transaction*) + 242 (QuartzCore + 58898) [0x7fff860f0612]   39  CA::Layer::layout_and_display_if_needed(CA::Transaction*) + 35 (QuartzCore + 61057) [0x7fff860f0e81]   39  CA::Layer::display_if_needed(CA::Transaction*) + 603 (QuartzCore + 63485) [0x7fff860f17fd]   39  -[_NSViewBackingLayer display] + 834 (AppKit + 401702) [0x7fff8fb3c126]   39  _NSBackingLayerDisplay + 617 (AppKit + 415019) [0x7fff8fb3f52b]   39  CA::Layer::display_() + 1546 (QuartzCore + 70716) [0x7fff860f343c]   39  x_blame_allocations + 81 (QuartzCore + 120468) [0x7fff860ff694]   39  ___ZN2CA5Layer8display_Ev_block_invoke + 59 (QuartzCore + 120535) [0x7fff860ff6d7]   39  CABackingStoreUpdate_ + 127 (QuartzCore + 120668) [0x7fff860ff75c]   39  __psynch_cvwait + 10 (libsystem_kernel.dylib + 90422) [0x7fff8293c136]  *39  psynch_cvcontinue + 0 (pthread + 26908) [0xffffff7f80ed891c]   Process:         Mail [24057] Path:            /Applications/Mail.app/Contents/MacOS/Mail Architecture:    x86_64 Parent:          launchd [1] UID:             501 Sudden Term:     Dirty Task size:       57324 pages (+4) CPU Time:        0.074s Note:            Unresponsive for 3984 seconds before sampling Note:            3 idle work queue threads omitted /code/pre  <answer191111> I use the Mail client under OSX 10.10.3 and tend to let the system run for long stretches.  The other day, I determined that I wasn't receiving messages, and the situation deteriorated to where sent messages were sitting in the Outbox.  Solution was to strongRestart/strong the Mac.  <answer191172> I have had the same problem since updating to Yosemite. None of the advice posted on any website seems to work until I tried this and so far Mail is working fine https://miapple.me/fixing-mac-os-x-10-10-yosemite-mail-not-responding/  give it a shot   <answer201324> I have seen this issue quite a few times and none of the solutions seemed to work very long. The issue kept on returning.  I do think I found a cause - although I only test 4-5 times. It seems to be an issue that keychain access is open - strangely enough :) Close keychain down and mail works fine again without deleting anything    Confirmed. Might have to wait 2 mins or so before the system processes the action of closing keychain.  <answer205763> https://miapple.me/fixing-mac-os-x-10-10-yosemite-mail-not-responding/ Seems to help on my macbook! Thanks so much guys :)  <answer224360> On my installation, Mail hanged whenever I tried to view the inbox. Deleting code~/Library/Containers/com.apple.mail//code or code~/Library/Mail//code didn't help, but when I moved a single message from my inbox to another mailbox in Gmail's web interface, Mail stopped hanging. When I moved the message back to the inbox, Mail started hanging again. I don't know what about that message caused the hang though.  <answer243842> My Mail.app was freezing when I tried to quit it (forcing me to force quit it) and it was also not letting me select folders (it just showed the same partial list of my email).  I tried https://miapple.me/fixing-mac-os-x-10-10-yosemite-mail-not-responding/ to no avail.  Believe it or not, what finally worked was:  ol liforce quit Mail.app/li liturn of Airport so my Mac was disconnected from the internet/li lirelaunch mail/li liquit Mail.app again (this time it worked)/li lirelaunch Mail.app/li liturn Airport back on again/li /ol  From that point on, Mail.app worked normally.  I think the issue was actually that it was trying to check or sync mail in one of my accounts and getting stuck.  The key step was probably #4, because if Mail.app could quit, then it was no longer caught in whatever infinite loop it was trying to do.  Incidentally, I went to Window-Connection Doctor and discovered an old SMTP server that was spinning forever.  I deleted it in Mail-Preferences-Accounts-Outgoing Mail Server (SMTP)-Edit SMTP Server List... then clicking on the bad server and clicking the [-] minus button on the left.  I don't think it was being used, but it's a good idea to not let those hang around, because Apple's interface for dealing with SMTP always made things very confusing.  <comment226909> Oops, I meant it HANGS again after a few hours, not crashes ;) <comment226950> Also, you probably meant 10.10.3, not 10.3.3 <comment227048> Yes, oarfish, I meant 10.10.3. Thanks. <comment227050> Thanks, Vzzdak. Alas, I restart ever day and it doesn't make a difference. <comment248213> Hi, welcome to AskDifferent.
