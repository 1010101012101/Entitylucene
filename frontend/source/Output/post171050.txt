Fixing my external hard drive's partition map <body> Okay, so something really strange has happened, and it's a doozy, so please bear with me.   hr  h2Problem: I need to fix my hard drive's partition map/h2  hr  So let me fill you in on what happened here.  I have an external 3TB hard drive that I use for storage with my Mac Pro. It recently had 4 partitions on it. This is what the map looked like.  ol liBackup em[OS X, Journaled]/em: 1.4TB/li liMacintosh HD clone em[OS X, Journaled]/em: 0.3 TB/li liYosemite em[OS X, Journaled]/em: 0.5 TB/li liWindows Bridge em[FAT]/em: 0.5 TB/li /ol  hr  I had originally downloaded and installed Yosemite on a separate partition to play around with it, and then when I decided I liked it, I copied my Mavericks Mac HD onto another partition of the drive as a backup. I then upgraded my main system to Yosemite.  Later on, I decided that I no longer needed the Mac HD clone, since Yosemite is pretty stable at this point, so I removed it; I also resized the Yosemite partition down to 300 GB since I wasn't going to write anything else to it.  The partition map then looked like this:  ol liBackup: 1.4TB/li liUnallocated: 0.3TB/li liYosemite: 0.3TB/li liUnallocated: 0.2TB/li liWindows Bridge: 0.5TB/li /ol  hr  That was all fine. However, recently, I installed Windows through Bootcamp on my primary SSD. In Windows' disk management, I tried to remove the Windows Bridge partition and replace it with a 0.7TB NTFS partition. The partition deleted, but the reformat operation failed, so I figured I would boot into OS X, remove the partition, and add a new FAT 0.7 TB partition which could then be reformatted by Windows into NTFS.  I opened up Disk Utility and saw that the Windows Bridge partition was still there according to OS X. So I went ahead and removed it.  hr  h2And then, bad stuff happened./h2  The windows partition removed successfully, but the Yosemite partition immediately became unrecognizable by OS X. The files are intact, but OS X sees it as disk1s3, and is unable to read, write, or repair the disk.  The strangest part of it all is that Windows can still read the drive. If I boot into Windows, I can copy anything from the partition, and it works just fine, but boot back into OS X, and the partition is unreadable.  hr  h2Things I've tried/h2  h31. TestDisk and PDisk/h3  I have tried to create my own partition map for the drive using TestDisk to find the partitions and PDisks to create the new partition. TestDisk shows some weird configurations. It appears as though there are two partitions, masquerading as MS Data, assigned to the same set of blocks, with the name Yosemite. That must be causing the problem:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QM7X0.png" alt="enter image description here"  PDisk will not let me open the disk to be rewritten.     pdisk: can't open file '/dev/rdisk1' for writing (Resource busy)   h32. Copying all of the files and re-formatting./h3  Since Windows can read the disk, I figured, why not copy everything from the Yosemite partition onto the Windows ST partition and reformat the broken partition. The only problem with that is that Windows limits path names to 255 bytes, and in OS X, a lot of the files have filenames that are much longer than that. I need all of the files on the drive in order to keep it bootable, so skipping those files that would not copy is out of the question.  hr  h2So:/h2  Do any of you fine people have any ideas as to how I can fix this partition map and/or get all of my data off of that partition so I can reformat it?  I can definitely go pick up another 3 TB drive to use to copy all of the files off of the existing drive so that the drive can be completely reformatted if you know of a way that I can get strongall/strong of the files off of the Yosemite partition.   hr  h2Edit:/h2  precode&gt;

The first is MBR, which has been around since the 1980’s. The second is GPT, which is fairly new. The third is a hybrid scheme which combines the first two. OS X’s Disk Utility application allows you to select either MBR or GPT. If MBR is selected, then you get the traditional MBR scheme. On the other hand, if you select GPT, you will get either the GPT or the hybrid MBR/GPT scheme. Normally, the GPT scheme is used, but if one or more partitions have a MS-DOS (FAT) or ExFAT format then the MBR/GPT scheme is employed. If an external drive is hybrid, Windows will see the drive as MBR. If Windows is used to change the partitioning on such as drive, the results are unpredictable. This is why Apple recommends only using MBR to partition an external drive to be used by both OS X and Windows.  I believe your external drive was partitioned as an hybrid drive. The output you posted from the gpt command shows both GPT and MBR partitions.   To review, here is the output you posted from the command codesudo fdisk /dev/disk1/code. It is the content of the MBR table.  precodeDisk: /dev/disk1    geometry: 45600/255/63 [732566645 sectors] Sector size: 4096 bytes Signature: 0xAA55          Starting       Ending  #: id  cyl  hd sec -  cyl  hd sec [     start -       size] ------------------------------------------------------------------------  1: EE 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [         1 -      76805] &lt;Unknown ID&gt;  2: AF 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [     76806 -  461468854] HFS+          3: 07 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [ 534820616 -   73242187] HPFS/QNX/AUX  4: 0C 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [ 608062976 -  124503552] Win95 FAT32L /code/pre  We want to remove partition 3 (Yosemite) from the table.

You have not given enough information for me to tell you how to fix the problem. What I need is for you to run some commands from the terminal application. The commands will not change anything.

But I can see the problem. Your disk1s3 is `Microsoft Basic Data` where it should be `Apple_HFS`. Let me finish reading, before starting a fix. <comment201261> Ok thank you for your help. <comment201267> Ok. I really appreciate the help. <comment201283> @DavidAnderson any luck? <comment201463> Do me a favor, I have only asked one question since I joined "Ask Different". [Does Windows, running on latest Apple computers, see boot disk partitioned as MBR or GPT?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/169680/does-windows-running-on-latest-apple-computers-see-boot-disk-partitioned-as-mb). Could you click on the link and post your answers to my questions? I am interested because your disk 0 does not appear to be hybrid MBR/GPT.
