How to enable USB tethering on your Android phone to Mac OS X Lion <body> I want to tether an unlimited data plan on a strongNexus S/strong em(with Android 2.3.6)/em via strongUSB cable/strong to a strongMacBook Air/strong em(with OS X Lion)/em.  Both on Windows and Ubuntu, it works like a charm, so I'm wondering if there's something I can do it OSX to make it work.  ol liThe articles I read imply that given Apple's restrictions, it's imposible and OSX only supports tethering an iPhone via USB./li liOn Android Enthusiasts, I found a a couple of solutions:   ol lione tethering from Froyo and /li lione tethering on a Snow Leopard, /li /ol/li /ol  but they all rely on third party Android apps. Is there any hack to make OSX work with it out of the box?  <answer32578> The following app has a strongvery detailed setup guide that you need to follow carefully/strong to make usb tethering work on Android.  I've tested this with my own strongNexus S (2.3.6)/strong and strongLion 10.7.2/strong. It works great!  Also, no root access is needed.  You really have to give credit to the developers. They went as far as to write drivers for Mac OS to get this work!  https://market.android.com/details?id=com.mstream.easytether_beta&amp;hl=en  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Wwmz7.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer100292> There is a native RNDIS driver for Mac OS X that allows you to use your Android phone's native USB tethering mode to get Internet access, it is called HoRNDIS: http://joshuawise.com/horndis  It is known to work with Mac OS X versions 10.6.8 (Snow Leopard) through 10.8.2 (Mountain Lion).  HoRNDIS is also available in source form on GitHub,  it is licensed under the GNU General Purpose License, version 3: http://github.com/jwise/HoRNDIS  <comment36897> I'm just curious: Why does it have to be USB? I use my Nexus S as a hotspot all the time. I put it in my wallet and the MBP on my knees and surf. It's really fast and reliable. <comment37126> Here's my scenario: part of Startup Weekend Toronto, you code for 54h with hundreds of other devs, so you end up tethering your phone, because the wi-fi there can't handle so many connections. With Wind as my data plan provider in that building the signal is very low. So I had it plugged via USB, to also recharge in the mean time, plus I preferred not to open the wi-fi tethering. <comment37308> OK, I guess this is the way to go... <comment109200> Problem is EasyTether doesn't work with Samsung devices <comment303355> This is the better answer in my opinion :) <comment303362> If you are using El Capitan and its not working for you try this pre-release: http://nyus.joshuawise.com/HoRNDIS-rel8pre2-dbg.pkg <comment334686> @Jammer doesn't work. I'm using El Capitan and installed that version. I enabled USB tethering on the phone but nothing shows up in System Preferences - Network.
