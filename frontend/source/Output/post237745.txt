Test ethernet cable quality <body> Is there a way to test an ethernet cable quality signal in a MacBook Pro retina with a thunderbolt adapter?  I've searched many places but all I can find is configuration issues. My configuration is ok but the ethernet cable is about 100 meters, which I understand that if I exceeded the connection quality drops a lot.   I need to test the cable stregth with a very far away Airport Extreme and to know if it's being affected by any interference. Since the cable is inside a wall, I can't tell if it's a CAT-5 o CAT-6 cable.  Thanks
