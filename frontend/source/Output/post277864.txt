Can use use my UK iPhone 5S in the USA? <body> I have an iPhone 5S registered in the United Kingdom with a United Kingdom simcard and number from T-Mobile. I have moved to the USA permanently and cannot call or text any American numbers. I have been told this is because I need to get a US simcard and number. (Please correct if wrong)  I am considering Tracphone as a provider, and asked them if I can use their plan/sim/number in my physical phone from the UK. The answer was      If the phone is an unlocked strongGSM/strong phone that must operate on strong850 and 1900 MHz/strong bands, you can use it.   (Bold emphasis mine). Does my UK-bought 5S fit those criteria?  <answer277932> Yes you can, according to https://support.apple.com/kb/sp685 all iphone 5s models can use GSM/EDGE on the 850 and 1900 bands, so you can make phone calls, text and use EDGE (know as 2G internet)     Cellular and Wireless:      Model A1533 (GSM)*: UMTS/HSPA+/DC-HSDPA (850, 900, 1700/2100, 1900, 2100 MHz); strongGSM/EDGE/strong (strong850/strong, 900, 1800, strong1900/strong MHz); LTE (Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 13, 17, 19, 20, 25)      Model A1533 (CDMA)*: CDMA EV-DO Rev.
