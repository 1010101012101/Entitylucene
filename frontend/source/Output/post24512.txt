What scriptable OCR Software exists on OSX for a paperless office <body> I'm planning to get a paperless office and for that, I a need good scriptable piece of OCR for OS X?  I've read a blogpost by Marco Arment about a few programs. Are there any workable ones there that allow me to script things?  <answer24531> Readiris for Mac. I have it, but I haven't used it in a long time, so I don't exactly remember how good it was. I think that it didn't do the first few documents very well, but it learns.  strikeOh, and I'm not sure about scriptability. I'll check it./strike  It looks like Readiris has a scripting dictionary, and it's pretty good, too.  <answer276158> ABBYY FineReader Pro for Mac does OCR well and is scriptable. From their blurb page:      Process Batches of Documents and Automate Conversion Tasks      Achieve new levels of productivity and enjoy greater flexibility when converting documents with support for Automator actions and AppleScript commands.   It supports both Applescript and Automator. I hadn't tried to automate it previously but after looking into it, I have some plans to do some basic stuff. This is really why I'm belatedly 'answering' this question.  <comment27510> Have you ruled out using Image Capture and letting the OS X OCR do it's job? If not, I'd jump to [PDFpen](http://www.smilesoftware.com/PDFpen/) if you think like Marco Arment does in his scriptable [OCR review](http://www.marco.org/2011/06/01/mac-pdf-ocr-software). <comment165013> Please review [How should I ask about getting a software recommendation?](http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/q/2180/5472) and edit this to describe what precisely you want the software to do and any limitations. Specifically, what scripting language are you looking to leverage? <comment168799> There is no OCR built into Image Capture or OS X.
