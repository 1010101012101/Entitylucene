(Jailbroken) iOS 7 stock apps missing on springboard <body> All apps from codeprivate/var/stash/Applications.xxxxxx/code are missing suddenly. I can't exactly say when that happened, don't think it was any specific codeCydia/code tweak. I still can codessh/code into my iPhone and see that the folder is still there, but the applications inside it won't show up on springboard. I already created a new symlink into root ("/") and I made codechmod 775/code for the applications folder. I've run out of ideas and would like to avoid a full restore. What could be wrong and what can I do?  <answer120615> It's a Springboard glitch where the apps aren't shown.  ul liInstall (or reinstall) a tweak in Cydia, then respring./li liDelete code/var/mobile/Library/Caches/com.apple.mobile.installation.plist/code then respring./li liRun codeuicache/code as mobile, then respring./li /ul  <comment140617> You really should just restore. That happened to me and that was all I could do. <comment140619> Yes, that´s what I actually did now, because I need the iPhone in a working condition. But I´m pretty sure, there must be a way to fix that somehow. <comment140730> I'm sure there is, but if it gets that messed up, I would argue that you should restore. When I had that happen, I couldn't access any stock iOS apps (they didn't show up), nor could I use the camera (even 3rd party camera apps didn't work). <comment140797> did both of it, but didn´t work...
