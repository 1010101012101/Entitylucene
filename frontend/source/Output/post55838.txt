How to set label color for "Utilities" folder in Lion? <body> In earlier versions of OSX I've set the label color of the /Applications/Utilities folder so that it's easy to spot (visually).  Lion disables the labels for this folder.  (Why?)  I've tried changing the permissions on the folder but that didn't work.  Anyone have a fix?  <answer55844> Lion disables most of the customizations that were once available in versions prior to 10.7. As to why that is I can only speculate, however, it can't be done like before. I personally do not recommend any type of SIMBL plug-in either, for it can cause more grief than happiness. I usually try and find the most sensible work-around for such things without having to go to extremes.  hr  Here's what I do:  ol liHighlight the Utilities folder/li liPress kbd⌘/kbd kbdL/kbd (Make alias)/li liRename the code[Utilites alias]/code to code[Utilities ]/code ↙ leaving and extra space behind the 's'/li liOpen Terminal and type the following:  codesudo chflags hidden /Applications/Utilities/code/li /ol  This will hide the original Utilities folder, leaving your new alias ready to label with your color of choice.  If you want to un-hide the original Utilities folder type codenohidden/code instead of codehidden/code. I hide it, since there's no point to having the Utilities alias and the original Utilities folder sitting there.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NbQix.png" alt="Color Label Utilities Mac OS X Lion"  <answer55846> There is a way to set the label value directly with codexattr/code:  precodesudo xattr -wx com.apple.FinderInfo 0000000000000000000C00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 /Applications/Utilities /code/pre  This will set the label to red.  For other labels  precodered: C orange: F yellow: B green: 5 blue: 9 violett: 7 grey: 3 /code/pre  To clear the label again, either use code0/code as a value or run codesudo xattr -d com.apple.FinderInfo /Applications/Utilities/code.  strongCaution/strong: This will wipe out any other FinderInfo value there might be set for the target file/directory already. For the Utilities folder this shouldn't be an issue but it might for others.   <answer55861> Unless something unexpected on your system is preventing labels from being applied to your Utilities folder, the following should work in Lion:  ol liLog into OS X using an administrator account./li liSelect the Utilities folder in the Finder and choose File  Get Info./li liUnder "Sharing and Permissions" at the bottom of the Get Info window, click the lock icon in the bottom right corner to unlock it. Enter your admin password when prompted./li liChange admin (group) privileges to "Read &amp; Write"./li liSet the label as desired./li liChange admin (group) privileges back to "Read only"./li liClose the Get Info window./li /ol  <comment64115> Works like a charm. So Lion simply introduced new default permissions for Utilities? <comment64184> @ephsmith, it looks like it — on 10.6.8 it appears admin has read/write ability and in 10.7.4 it's default is set to read only.
