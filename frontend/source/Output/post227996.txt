OS X Internet not working w/o TOR after messing with security settings? <body> So I was setting up the security settings on my Macbook using this guide when suddenly something's gone quite wrong (before going into details I should notice that all the traffic on my system is routed through the Tor network for privacy purposes).  I was following the steps strongFirewall/strong &amp; strongServices/strong at the time; I set up my firewall settings first and moved on to modify the emhosts/em and empf.conf/em files as shown in this link (I've also configured em/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.mDNSResponder.plist/em to have a em-NoMulticastAdvertisements/em option, which as far as I know disables Bonjour). So it all was working seemingly fine, but after I've restarted the system it turned out that the internet connection wouldn't work at all without Tor being ran â€“ Firefox spits out 'Server not found' error when I'm trying to open any link after changing the emNetwork Location/em from my Tor settings to emAutomatic/em. I tried to undo everything and have restored the files back to the default settings, but the problem remains.  That wouldn't be that much of a big deal, given that I have Tor running pretty much all the time the system is on, but I'm rather curious what might've caused it and how I could possibly fix the issue. Any help, please?
