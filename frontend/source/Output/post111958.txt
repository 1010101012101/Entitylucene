Type codeifconfig | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1/code to remove a lot of the unneeded text./li liIf you want your external IP address, just go to codewhatismyip.com/code or to Google and type 'IP Address' to show your public IP./li liYou can also find your internal IP address by going to System Preferences | Network and viewing your current connection (either AirPort for wireless, or Ethernet for wired, typically). Your status should display the current IP address./li /ol  <comment131540> You didn't specify internal or external IP address, so I made some assumptions and posted an answer below. <comment131542> Let's tighten the requirements up.
