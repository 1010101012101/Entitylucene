A good iPhone app for it when standing in the dock <body> I have an Apple dock for my iPhone 4 and find it beautiful so I like to have it in my desktop or my bed table while charging. The thing is I'd like to have a simple app that shows me the time, weather, maybe a small brief of my social network accounts, dunno just useful info so the phone isn't just standing there with the screen off.  I find difficult to find something like this with a decent graphics quality in the iTunes Store. Any suggestions?   <answer17025> I'm using Alarm Clock (there's a free version, but with an ad on the bottom, so not very "beautiful").  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/U4IW1.jpg" alt="alarm clock pro"  It shows the time of the day (obviously) and can also show the date, and the weather/temperature. Nice touch: sliding your finger increase/decrease brightness.  (But no social network)  <answer17028> The easiest way to do this and get exactly the look you want is to create (or find) a web site that displays that.  Go to it on Safari, and make a web clipping out of it.
