List Time Machine backups of a file <body> If I have a file or directory path, how can I list all Time Machine backups of that path?  <answer231344> Here's my attempt:  precode#!/bin/bash # list Time Machine backups of a file starting with most recent  if [ "$#" -ne 1 ]; then     echo "Usage: list_backups.sh filename"     exit fi  filename=`realpath "$1"`  # find root volume path for vol in /Volumes/*; do      if [ "$(readlink "$vol")" = / ]; then          root_vol=$vol     fi done   # prepend it to input path if necessary if [[ "$filename" != /Volumes* ]]; then     filename="$root_vol$filename" fi  # remove /Volumes from input path filename="${filename///Volumes}"  # loop over backups in reverse order tmutil listbackups | tail -1000 -r | while IFS= read -r line; do     if [ -e "$line$filename" ]; then         ls -ald "$line$filename"     else         echo "not in $line"     fi done /code/pre  <answer231345> Assuming that you didn't change the name of your main drive from 'Macintosh HD' to something else, you can run  precodels -l /Volumes/Time\ Machine/Backups.backupdb/$(hostname -s)/*/Macintosh\ HD/$(realpath FILENAME) /code/pre  to see all versions stored in TimeMachine.  PS coderealpath/code is only available if you have GNU coreutils installed (e.g. via brew). Otherwise use code$(pwd)/FILENAME/code or (if this doesn't work because there are some symlinks involved) specify the full path instead.  <comment282533> You realize that Time Machine uses hard links - so each interval where that file was present will have a backup of that path? Look at the hard link counts and you can see how many instances of that version of the file are on the volume. <comment283153> @bmike: That's true. I wasn't really concerned with duplicate entries though -- just interested in a list of dates that have backups, so I can easily  restore one.
