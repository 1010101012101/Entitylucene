Uninstalled XCode still paused in 'Purchases,' will not resume or delete <body> I was trying to re-install XCode, but have run into trouble. I first uninstalled it by deleting the code.app/code file from the Finder, and then rebooted my machine. Upon returning to the App Store, I saw that XCode was listed as 'Paused' under purchases, with 0 GB downloaded, and will not resume or download again.  When I click codeResume/code, nothing happens. There is no icon in the launcher, and running codexcode-select -p/code outputs:     /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools   But there is no 'XCode' in this folder.   I basically just want to uninstall everything to do with XCode, and re-install it. I'm running Yosemite 10.10, if that helps.    Edit: I also tried deleting the codecom.apple.appstore/code folder, to no avail.  <answer154455> Try clearing bcom.apple.appstore/b from the TMPDIR.    precodeopen $TMPDIR../C   /code/pre  and       precodeopen $TMPDIR../T /code/pre  find bcom.apple.appstore/b and delete it from both the folder.  Then restart the App Store.  <comment181716> That did it, thank you! (Or at least, made it disappear from the queue, will try and install again now-- cheers!)
