accepting Xcode license without having whole Xcode <body> I have installed XCL(Xcode command line) through codexcode-select --install/code therefore, not whole Xcode installed.  and I can see the path  precodexcode-select -print-path /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools /code/pre  However, I need to accept the license, but it complains that the Xcode is not installed   precodesudo xcodebuild -license xcode-select: error: tool 'xcodebuild' requires Xcode, but active developer directory '/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools' is a command line tools instance /code/pre  If you recommend me to install whole Xcode first ? should I uninstall XCT first ? and if so how !
