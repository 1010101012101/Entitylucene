Safari doesn't open pages sometimes <body> Safari won't open some pages temporary, however they are online (checked with multiply sites). Reboot helped once. And chrome does open them. What could be the cause?  <comment321306> Please provide more information. Are you referring to specific websites? Which ones? Does other websites display correctly? <comment321952> @alljamin one that i checked was Kickstarter.com. Yes, other ones I used worked fine.
