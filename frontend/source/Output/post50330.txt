How to arrange two windows easily to left and right side? <body> In Windows 7, we can easily arrange two windows with these shortcuts: kbdOption (Alt) ⌥/kbd + kbd←/kbd maximizes the window to the left side of the screen, and kbdOption (Alt) ⌥/kbd + kbd→/kbd maximizes the window to the right side of the screen.  I'm using a 27" iMac now, and I'd really like to do this. Does Mac OS X have this functionality?  <answer50332> I use BTT (Better Touch Tool) which includes window snapping, as well as a whole host of other useful features such as extra multitouch gestures, and button management.  You can use as much or as little as you want, but window snapping is on by default and just means you drag an application to the top to maximise it, left to align and fill the left half, and to the right for the right.  EDIT: This is called BST (Better Snap Tool) and it is no longer free. El Capitan has an implemented feature (press green button until you can drop it to the side) or check other free tools like Spectacle  Update: As of Feb 20, 2016 BST is $2.99 USD.  <answer50333> Another tool is Moom (5$ in the Apple Store): you can divide the screen in a number of squares and define keyboard shortcut to position the windows. Several emstandard/em placements are already defined by default (right/left half, bottom/top half, ...)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/y8hXW.png" alt="Moom screenshot"br I never used anything else (I'm very happy with Moom) but DoublePane was mentioned several time on AskDifferent and it seems that several other alternatives exist.  <answer50389> I’ve used SizeUp.app before, which allows you to press e.g. kbd⌘/kbd+kbd⌥/kbd+kbdCtrl/kbd+kbd←/kbd to make the active window fill the left half of the screen, and kbd⌘/kbd+kbd⌥/kbd+kbdCtrl/kbd+kbd→/kbd to make it fill the right half.  It has lots of other options as well:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Yn61f.png" alt="SizeUp.app"  hr  If you prefer to use the mouse instead of the keyboard, you could use Cinch.app by the same authors. It allows you to drag any window to the left or right side of the screen to make it fill that half of the screen.  Both these apps aren’t free (although they’re very cheap), but they have free trials. Check it out!  <answer50391> h1Cinch/h1  Cinch brings the window management of Windows 7 to the Mac with a simple and easy to use application.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pQQHO.jpg" alt="cinch: windows 7 window management for the Mac"  <answer82366> There are a number of free alternatives for that work well. These include :  ul liBetterTouchTool/li liShiftit/li liSpectacle/li liTileWindows Lite/li /ul  There are many alternative window sizing utilities freely available.  <answer82367> Divvy would be the software I recommend that is the most Mac like in design and implementation, yet it hits all the functionality most Windows 7 users prefer or are used to having.  <answer102377> There's also BetterSnapTool, made by the same developer as BetterTouchTool. It has more features than BetterTouchTool, and it's in the Mac App Store for $1.99. Yes, it's a bit more expensive than free, but I personally prefer BetterSnapTool (and you're supporting the developer; very important).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AdeJf.jpg" alt=""  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2pxCb.jpg" alt=""  <answer111535> I have used BetterTouchTool for a long time, but found it sometimes needed to be restarted because it stops working.   I have also used Divvy, and am now switching to Divvy-only.   My personal setup is to use the tilt left/right scroll wheel buttons on a Logitech mouse to snap the windows to left/right halves of the screen. Clicking the scroll wheel button maximizes a window. Divvy doesn't allow mouse shortcuts AFAIK, so I used the Logitech control center to make those buttons trigger the shortcuts I configured in Divvy. If anyone is using a similar mouse maybe this is good info; Divvy is a great application either way.    <answer111557> I use these AppleScripts:  precodetry     tell application "Finder"         set b to bounds of window of desktop     end tell     try         tell application (path to frontmost application as text)             set bounds of window 1 to {0, 22, (item 3 of b) / 2, item 4 of b}         end tell     on error         tell application "System Events" to tell window 1 of (process 1 where frontmost is true)             set position to {0, 22}             set size to {(item 3 of b) / 2, (item 4 of b) - 22}         end tell     end try end try /code/pre    precodetry     tell application "Finder"         set b to bounds of window of desktop     end tell     try         tell application (path to frontmost application as text)             set bounds of window 1 to {((item 3 of b) / 2), 22, item 3 of b, item 4 of b}         end tell     on error         tell application "System Events" to tell window 1 of (process 1 where frontmost is true)             set position to {(item 3 of b) / 2, 22}             set size to {(item 3 of b) / 2, (item 4 of b) - 22}         end tell     end try end try /code/pre  The scripts first try to tell the application to change the bounds property and then tell System Events to change the position and size properties. Using System Events (or the accessibility API) works with more applications, but it can also appear a bit glitchy because the position and size are not changed at the same time. Other applications like Slate always use accessibility API.  <answer144894> My favorite is Spectacle   Out of the box your shortcuts works exactly as you describe in your question.  kbd⌘ ⌥ ←/kbd  left half side of the screen, and kbd⌘ ⌥ →/kbd  for the right.  It also supports assigning a shortcut for moving a window to another screen:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BW5g3.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer153474> Yet another tool suggestion: ShiftIt. Free, actively under development, completely open source, lightweight, very easy to use, and keeps a low profile in the top menu bar.  <answer212607> Apple has provided this functionality as part of its OS X El Capitan. Here are the steps:  ol liClick and hold on the green maximize button of an active window (for example, a Safari window);/li liWhen the window shrinks slightly and the background becomes highlighted, you’re about to enter Split View, while continuing to hold the green button drag the active window into either the left or right panel to place it full screen there;/li liAs soon as you place the first window into the Split View panel, the other side of the screen turns into a mini-Expose much like Mission Control, simply click the window tile you want to open into Split View for the other side here to immediately send it side by side into Split Full Screen Mode./li /ol  The answer has been taken from osxdaily.com website's page.  <answer219696> Try using El Capitain's split screen mode  <answer225474> I just discovered strongMagnet/strong available on the App store for $1.99 (current price as of posting) that provides the ability to "snap" windows to corners, right, left, etc.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wUujl.png" alt="Magnet preferences"  So far, it works as advertised. I am not affiliated with the app or developer.  Just found it and find it useful.  <answer255945> By default, you can use the (green) maximize button on the window bar as follows:  1.Click and hold the green maximize window button,you will notice a slight change in screen size. 2. Now drag the window to the left or right hand side.   <comment57696> wow, excellent. It works. <comment57801> Probably the best option out of all of these choices (even better than my answer) :-) <comment57830> This is cool too. There were many nice apps I didn't even heard. I'm waiting some other stuffs. <comment57833> @Benjamin Yes. I love Cinch. It is great! <comment57834> Are you aiming to do this constantly for particular windows that you wish to set up to be in a certain position at all times? If so, i think i have a better solution you might not know about <comment57835> An awesome thing with Moom is the ability to write applescript to load a named window config.  Use your favorite launcher (launchbar, quicksilver, qsb, etc) to instantly arrange windows the way you want to. <comment57942> Why the downvote? <comment95048> Many windows management tools are listed on several other threads. http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/9659/what-window-management-options-exist-for-os-x and http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/9659/what-window-management-options-exist-for-os-x are notably good Q&A <comment127408> Moom isn't free, but it does come with a free trial - which, for me, was enough to fall in love with it. It's not a resource hog (about 38 MB of memory on Mavericks). It offers keyboard shortcuts that provide similar functionality to what I was used to with Windows 7. And, it provides a multitude of other features and finer control of moving and zooming windows (including saving/restoring snapshots). Highly recommended. <comment207201> It's called Better Snap Tool now, and it's no longer free ($1.99). <comment207826> $1.99?!? Forget that! I have a PB&J sandwich with my name on it! <comment208291> There's a massive memory leak in BTT. I used it for a long time before figuring out it was the culprit. Really great app, but it will bring your computer to a crawl after a couple hours. <comment251896> Has a free trial, and works great with mouse, but has no keyboard support. <comment272726> So useless (I mean the feature not the answer). OS X has the most useless window management - maybe it is "ok" for standard users but for those who use it for work and need to be efficient, it is disaster if you don't use external apps. I don't get it, they must pay thousands and thousands $ for UX designers and still they got so huge glitches like this. <comment280604> preferred the native answer! thanks <comment297773> Now $9.99 in the App Store. <comment298639> Still a good answer as of June 2016 on El Capitan. <comment303485> The original question implies Lion. <comment303494> @TranslucentCloud: I know. I mentioned this answer because OSX El Capitan was released by then and it was given for free. <comment327194> wow, excellent. It works. <comment367529> I would _never_ in a 1000 years have found the press-and-hold feature on the green resize button. Thanks :) <comment369194> This is not a valid answer because 1) It does not involve keyboard shortcuts 2) It requires multiple steps using the mouse/trackpad 3) It locks two windows into shared full-screen mode. The OP is asking for something specific, and this does not answer it. <comment369195> Moom is the only one so far which actually behaves in the same way as expected. Thanks to the answered for the screenshot as well as it makes the configuration clear without needing to be verbose in the text.
