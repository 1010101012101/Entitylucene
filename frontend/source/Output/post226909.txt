A new ExFAT partition prevents bootcamp from starting windows <body> I'm trying to create a shared partition that I can use from both Windows and OS X. I made a new partition, but if I make it FAT or ExFAT Windows does not start. I get Error code: 0xc000000e. I assume this is because it tries to boot from the empty partition instead of the bootcamp partition.  If I make the partition use Apple's filesystem, I can boot to Windows again but then the partition becomes read-only.  Any suggestions how to solve this? All partitions are on the same hard drive - I don't have any external drives. I created my Bootcamp installation using Yosemite and later updated. Today I used El Capitan to create the new shared partition. It is a MacBook Pro from mid 2014 and I run Windows 10.

What version of windows do you have installed? It is also important where you created the new partition with respect to the OS X and Windows partitions. Can you edit your question and add the output from the Terminal command `diskutil list`?
