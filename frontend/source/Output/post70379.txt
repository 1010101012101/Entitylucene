cannot download Safari 6.0.2 update from App Store on ML <body> As by the title!  I have an update notification:  precodeSafari 6.0.2  Safari 6.0.2  is recommended for all users running Mountain Lion   v10.8.2 and includes security updates.  For more information, please  visit: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1222 /code/pre  I try to update and I get:  precode An error has occurred  The operation couldnâ€™t be completed.   (NSURLErrorDomain error -3001.)(102) /code/pre  Is this a problem my side?  If so, how can I fix it?  <answer70380> As I have the same problem here, It's likely to be DNS issue with apple's CDN servers. So my take is that this is a temporary internet issue and nothing you can do but wait for it to clear up.  <answer70392> According to this thread https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4338186?start=45&amp;tstart=0 the problem is on the Apple side of things and thus there is nothing to do aside from waiting.  If one does not want to wait the iPhoto update is available from here: http://support.apple.com/downloads/ while the safari update seems to be available from CNet http://download.cnet.com/1770-20_4-0.html?query=Safari+6.0.2&amp;platformSelect=Mac&amp;tag=srch&amp;searchtype=downloads&amp;filterName=platform%3DMac&amp;filter=platform%3DMac though I will not be downloading a emsecurity update/em from a third party!  <answer70406> Here you have a direct Apple link: http://swcdn.apple.com/content/downloads/53/02/041-8081/2jwp4wjrwygtm4lc608qy4h0n4a9yyq37g/Safari6.0.2Mountain.pkg  <comment84059> The temporary download issues are resolved - this was of use and we can keep it around so people know sometimes the updates do not roll out smoothly.
