Window rendering error <body> I have come upon this problem recently:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pabs4.jpg" alt="image"  At first I thought it happened because Android studio 2.2RC, but now it started appearing in Chrome too. Trying to create a screenshot or capturing part of the screen causes it to go away (that's why I took the picture with a phone). These traces appear when moving windows over either Chrome or Android studio. How do I prevent this?
