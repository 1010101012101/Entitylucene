Black border around iPhone 4 display <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rIMhc.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  I just got my developer certificate from apple and I tried to add provisioning to my iPhone so I connected it to my macbook pro and everything went fine suddenly I started to get a black thin border around my screen.  <answer114509> That's standard behaviour on all iPhones, I see the same border on my phone. It is not related to developer certificates/provisioning.
