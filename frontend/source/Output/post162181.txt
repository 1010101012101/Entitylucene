Remove photo from iPhoto slideshow <body> I have created an iPhoto slideshow and posted it to iCloud with public access.  I now want to remove a photo.  I went back to the slideshow source list in iPhoto and when I click on the slideshow button, it shows there but when I double-click it to get the photo browser and choose the appropriate slideshow, it plays, no thumbnail pictures show so that I can delete. iPhoto 9.6 and OS X Yosemite 10.10.1  <comment189564> Does hitting Esc go back to the editor?
