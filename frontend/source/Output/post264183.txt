Make all email contacts searchable in the TO field in Mac Mail regardless of what email account you're sending from <body> I've got multiple email accounts that I use in Mac Mail. (5 google apps for business, 1 gmail and 1 imap/smtp account provided as part of a shared hosting package).   Sometimes if I'm in one account and try and draft an email it won't allow me to search for my contacts correctly, eg. if I'm in account A and start typing codebob@/code it will give me a dropdown of all contacts that start codebob@/code but if I'm in another account it won't give me the same list of contacts. Is there a way to make all contacts available to all email accounts?
