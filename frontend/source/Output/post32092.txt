Is there a way to type Niqqud on iOS? <body> On my iPod touch I am able to type basic Hebrew characters by adding a Hebrew international keyboard.  Is there some way for me to type Hebrew vowels (Niqqud) [without using any specialized apps]?  <answer32101> Don't know Hebrew, but on iOS 5 there's a load of built in international keyboards, one of them Hebrew.  Go to Settings  General  International (Near the bottom)  Keyboards.  In there you can add a Hebrew keyboard, and any others you need.   When you activate the keyboard anywhere on your iPod touch now, you should a "world" key near the bottom left. Tap that to cycle through the different keyboards you added.  This should be available in earlier iOS versions, but I'm not sure if the settings are in the same location.  Hope that helps.  <answer32107> I think not, only by using a hardware keyboard or via copy/paste from another doc or an app like Unicode Maps.  You might be able to make a custom layout as well with Unicode Maps.  Also have a look at Keyman.  <answer38768> Jailbreak your phone, then edit \System\Library\Frameworks\UIKit.framework\Keyboard-he.plist, changing, for example,  ז׳ ז to ז׳ ז זִ זֶ זַ זָ זֹ זּ   <answer99741> No, you want to use Google Translate for that. For example, the word that they gave me for "USA" is אַרצוֹת הַבְּרִית (ertzot-habreet). Google Translate cannot give you most phrases using niqqud, so I suggest doing the following:  ol liCopy and paste all the words you want to say into Pages (or another word processor)./li liPut them together in a Hebrew sentence like:  . אֲנִי לֹא מִכָּאן (ani lo m'kan) = I'm not from there./li /ol  Hope this helps!  <answer195272> UniK - Unicode &amp; navigation Keyboard extension allows you to do that. Swipe up and press the Aleph base character and if you want niqqud swipe right.  <comment36810> I indicated that I am aware of this in my question. I'm asking for additional functionality. <comment43880> To clarify, what does that change? The list of alternate characters that appears when you long-press the given key? <comment45575> Yes. Alternatively, it is probably possible to create a whole new keyboard layout with the Niqqud as separate characters, but I haven't looked into that yet.
