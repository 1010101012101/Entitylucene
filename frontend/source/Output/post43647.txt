Can I change the carrier name in the iPhone Simulator 5.0? <body> I found numerous instructions to set codeSBFakeCarrier/code in codecom.apple.springboard/code plist but this doesn't seem to work with iOS Simulator 5.0.   Is there any way to change the carrier name in the simulator?  <answer49742> For my part, I was able to change the carrier name for the iPhone 5.1 simulator by editing this file:  precode/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneSimulator5.1.sdk/System/Library/CoreServices/SpringBoard.app/French.lproj/SpringBoard.strings /code/pre  As the path suggests, I'm French. Switch to whichever localization you choose.  Inside this strings file (editable with XCode if it's a binary plist), you'll find a codeSIMULATOR_CARRIER_STRING/code key. Change its value, fire up your simulator, and there you go.  <answer55377> I wrote a fake carrier hack for recent versions of the iOS Simulator which do not support the codeSBFakeCarrier/code hack anymore. Just compile the codeXCDFakeCarrier.m/code file in your project and change the codeFakeCarrier/code constant to what you want.  <answer82792> I wrote a little tutorial that helps you change the carrier name even on iOS 6.0 and up: https://github.com/toursprung/iOS-Screenshot-Automator/blob/master/changeCarrierName  <comment55314> Might get some responses from stackoverflow? <comment56903> Not off-topic, as it relates specifically to an app running on the OS X platform and is not necessarily a development related question. <comment56943> How do I get XCode to open this file with a correct encoding? <comment56948> Dunno, I systematically convert binary plists to XML before editing them â€” use `plutil -convert xml1 binary_plist_filename` <comment105094> Works great in 6.1 <comment132765> Just wanted to let you guys know, the new path for iOS 7 is: /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneSimulator7.0.sdk/System/Library/CoreServices/SpringBoard.app/en.lproj
