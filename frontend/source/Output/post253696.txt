Deleted my Photos.app accidentally <body> I accidentally deleted my Photos.app from /Applications dir. I looked up the internet but couldn't find a way to get it back.

It's an required macOS app. It's like if you try to delete codeSystem Preferences/code.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LHrXv.png" alt="enter image description here"  Maybe you didn't see the app. Try to search it with Spotlight.  <comment315739> Though not explicitly mentioned the OP probably deleted Photos.app in macOS/OS X and not in iOS. <comment315752> Have you checked your Trash? If you haven't cleared the Trash, you can just right click on the Photos app and say Put Back. <comment315780> No I emptied my Trash. I had done this awhile ago. <comment316054> Updated the question with dialog that appears when I try to access Photos.app <comment316055> So you deleted your photo *library*. Unless you had a backup, it's gone. <comment316068> So now you don't have any problem? <comment316081> Yeah, it's fixed!
