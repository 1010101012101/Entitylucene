Changing keyboard shortcut for cycling through windows? (Lion) <body> I recently received a MacBook Air (Summer 2011, Lion) from work and I'm in the process of configuring it to work like my personal MBA (same model, Lion).  I was happily setting keyboard shortcuts when I came across a rather interesting problem. On my personal MBA I use the combination kbd⌘/kbdstrong+/strongkbd`/kbd to open a Total-Terminal window. This combination is usually used to cycle through windows, in the opposite direction of kbd⌘/kbdstrong+/strongkbdtab/kbd.  When I was attempting to set this shortcut in Total-Terminal on my new MBA I got the error:     The key combination "Command + `" can't be used because it's already used by the menu item "Cycle Through Windows".   I immediately went to Keyboard - Keyboard Shortcuts to look for the key binding but I couldn't find it (kbd⌘/kbdstrong+/strongkbdtab/kbd is also bound to "Move focus to next window", changing this shortcut and disabling it does not fix the problem). I kept looking and couldn't find it.  Am I just glossing it over or is it not there? Is there any way for me to remove this keyboard shortcut? System-level shortcuts don't seem to be on the menu.  <answer51938> Many applications like Terminal also have a menu item like Window  Cycle Through Windows. It stays assigned to ⌘&#x60; even if you change the shortcut in the Keyboard &amp; Text Input preferences.  You could add a custom shortcut for Cycle Through Windows in the Application Shortcuts preferences, or disable it with codedefaults write -g NSUserKeyEquivalents -dict-add "Cycle Through Windows" nul/code.  You could also force TotalTerminal to use ⌘&#x60; by editing code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Terminal.plist/code directly.  precode&lt;key&gt;ToggleVisor&lt;/key&gt; &lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;KeyCode&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;integer&gt;50&lt;/integer&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Modifiers&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;integer&gt;9437184&lt;/integer&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; /code/pre  <comment59402> Exactly what I was looking for. Thanks!
