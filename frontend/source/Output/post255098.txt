macOS Sierra Console not reading \n as new lines anymore <body> I use Console to view php error logs—usually with something like:  precodeerror_log( print_r( $happyVariable, 1 ) );  /code/pre  —which Console would present to me as nicely formatted information about my code$happyVariable/code. macOS Sierra's Console app, however, leaves a single line of barf peppered with the code\n/codes that should be read as new lines.  I'm looking for a way to have Console read code\n/code as a line beak or a workaround to have pretty logs with either Console or codetail -f error_log/code.
