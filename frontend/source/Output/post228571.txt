quicklooksatellite is blocking trash files <body> I can't empty Trash folder. Some of files there are "in use". And it happens all the time.     The operation can’t be completed because the item “blabla.xlsx” is in use.   I don't have any applications with these files. I don't have Finder with this folder open. And I didn't.  When I launch "What's Keeping Me?" utility, it says, that this file is opened in "QuickLookSatellite".  Is it possible to prevent?  OSX El Captain 10.11.3  <answer228581> I'm not sure about preventing it, but you can certainly try:  precodesudo rm -rf ~/.Trash/* /code/pre  You may be prompted for your password. The command will forcibly get rid of everything in your trash bin.  <comment278706> Did you use QuickLook to preview those files or folders ? <comment278732> @PratikaRana Maybe before they got deleted, certainly not after. <comment278733> Thank you for advice, but it sounds like a workaround, not a solution. I get this problem all the time... <comment278734> It is indeed a workaround. If you're getting this problem frequently, try Console and search for quicklook <comment279027> If you use QuickLook to preview a file or folder and you delete it afterwards, it will dsiplay the message that the files/folders are in use when emptying the trash. The only solution then is to use "Delete Immediately" within the trash.
