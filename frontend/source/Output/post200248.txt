Audio MIDI Setup: have a default configuration for a headset <body> I have a Logitech G430 USB headset and, every time I plug it in, the emThru/em checkbox at the emInput/em tab is enabled, which means I hear myself through the speakers:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1NQAl.png" alt="Thru checkbox"  Is there any way I can configure my Mac so that checkbox is always disabled by default?
