iCloud storage iPhone backup <body> 2 iPhones show on my iPad as being backed up. I only have one, so I guess one is my old phone. I would like to delete it but I'm not sure which one I should delete, I don't want to remove the wrong one.br How can I tell which is which?  <answer147396> Go to https://www.icloud.com/#settings which should show all registered devices &amp; their names. Using the device name, model &amp; even Serial Number or IMEI info, you can decide which to delete.
