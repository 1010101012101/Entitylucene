How do I view negative reviews for a podcast in the iTunes store? <body> How do I read negative reviews for a podcast in the iTunes store? It looks like they are censoring reviews. I myself wrote a negative review but I don't see it showing up.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/slwBI.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer210623> Not all reviews get posted and sometimes the delay is days or weeks for some reviews to show. I believe the stars get updates much more rapidly as a human doesn't need to review those ratings like Apple does for the word portions of reviews.  This is similar to app reviews:  ul liIs there a standard delay for consumer ratings of apps on the App Store?/li liWhy do iPhone App Store ratings and reviews seem to get processed so slowly?/li /ul  I believe if you put star ratings in and feel they aren't updating, a request to the iTunes store support team might help unstick a podcast with problems updating. https://www.apple.com/support/itunes/contact/ and choose Store Support.
