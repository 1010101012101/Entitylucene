Add anniversary to calendar <body> iOS calendar add birthdays but no anniversary. How can I add them from the contacts to the calendar?  <answer68610> Not directly through the iPhone, but, strongBirthDayScanner/strong does exactly that.  It scans the strongAddress Book/strong for all dates. Then presents them to you, to choose and edit, or play around, and then generates events directly in strongiCal/strong which can be synced with the strongiPhone/strong.    <answer107885> free tool to remeber anniversaries..  https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/anniversary-reminder/id614159715?mt=8  <answer220614> Another work around would be to add a contact, called for exemple Wedding Me and My Wife and add a birthday to it. So it will show like a birthday in the calendar but you'll not it's an anniversary.   <answer276626> Asked quite some time ago, and the feature was not yet implemented.  But there is a work-around, using your friend Google.  In short:  ul liCreate/use a Google mail account/li liOn https://contacts.google.com create a contact with birthday and/or other dates:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vpP5R.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liAdd your Google account to your iOS/macOS device - how? read https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/99358/li liIn iOS Calendar, activate from that account the calendar strongBirthday/strong/li liSee your contact's birthday and/or other dates in the Calendar app:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pKhIP.png" alt="enter image description here"/li /ul  (Please excuse the unprofessional screenshot)  <comment79694> You can add an anniversary field in Contacts/Preferences/Templates with the pull down by choosing "Dates" but alas, it does not show up in the Calendar. No doubt that will come in some future version of Calendar. I thought I found the answer... at least we can put anniversary dates in Contacts and wait for the day Calendar inherits that field. <comment79731> There is something like this for windows? <comment126545> Can you please add some details about the app and why you are recommending it?
