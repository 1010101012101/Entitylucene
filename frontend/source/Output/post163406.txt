time capsule with 3com officeconnect router <body> I would like to connect my time capsule to my 3com officeconnect adsl modem router and connect  my computers to the wifi provided by the time capsule.   In my 3com admin page I have a bunch of settings for PPPoE.   In order for this work, I understand I should I put my 3com to bridged mode? (how?)   Do I have to re-enter all the PPPoE settings in the mac time capsule utility?   How do I get this to work? The light is currently flashing amber in the TC.  Thank you.  <comment191302> To be clear, the 3Com unit is also a wifi-enabled model and you want to use only the wifi provided by the Time Capsule? <comment191304> yes. I would like to use the wifi ac provided by Time Capsule since that's also one of it's strengths compared to the old 3com router <comment191336> You might be able to do this by manually entering the 3Com's SSID and authentication into the settings of the TC, then set the 3Com to not advertise the SSID. Both units set as as DHCP servers, NAT and port forwarding enabled on the TC.
