MacBook Pro only turns on at specific times after cleaning <body> My MacBook Pro has been running fine for the past year. Two days ago when I tried to clean my MacBook Pro with a dry cloth, I heard a half chime sound while I was cleaning the keyboard. Since then my MacBook is not turning on during specific time.  I tried to turn it on until 2am (GMT+5) and nothing happened but when I turn it on after 3am (GMT+5) it turns on normally. When I try to turn it on in the afternoon (after returning from job) it doesn't turn on. This sounds really stupid but I have observed it for two days. I don't what has happened or what to make of it.  It charges normally no problem with that. It doesn't turn on even when battery is fully charged.  <answer196080> Has a schedule been set up? Check in Preferences  Energy Saver. Look at the bottom right under Schedule. You didn't do the cleaning with the power on? Did you hit a shortcut key combo? Here is a shortcut discussion with some common ones to check.: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201236  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DnEE2.png" alt="screenshot of Energy Saver window"    <comment234145> No. I had it turned off while cleaning. <comment234146> I think I have verified that schedule thing. I'll double check that again. <comment234531> I have verified that. No schedule was set. <comment234532> I tried to reset SMC. Now it has gone worse. Not turning on at all.
