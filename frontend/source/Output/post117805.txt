How do I set up Firefox to keep only cookies from select sites, when I use Firefox-Sync? <body> I use Firefox on a desktop iMac, a MacBook and my Android Samsung Galaxy S III mobile phone. All installations of Firefox are set to sync over Firfox's inbuilt Firefox-Snyc feature.  On my desktop computer I have set Firefox to delete all cookies when I close Firefox and defined exceptions, telling Firefox to keep cookies from those sites. I followed this instruction.  This worked fine at first: I visited some sites, closed Firefox, opened Firefox, looked at the cookies, and all cookies had been deleted except those from the excepted sites.  But after I began using Firefox on my other computers, I noticed that:  (a) all cookies were being deleted sometimes; sometimes all remained  (b) the exceptions disappeared sometimes; sometimes they remained  So the question is:  strongHow do I set up Firefox to keep only cookies from select sites, when I use Firefox-Sync?/strong  <answer218699> Firefox Sync doesn't support site permissions, unfortunately.
