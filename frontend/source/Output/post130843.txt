How do I add an iframe whitelist to OS X Server 3.1.1 <body> I can't seem to be able to find how to add a whitelist to the Wiki Server on OS X Server 3.1.1 the collabd service.  The information is missing from the documentation at  http://help.apple.com/wikiuser/mac/4.0/  neither at:  https://help.apple.com/advancedserveradmin/mac/3.1/  <answer134654> There is a fix to this problem -- Instead of changing the white list file in /Library/Server/Wiki/Config you have to change the whitelist.plist.default fine in the Server.app bundle (/Applications/Server.app/Contents/ServerRoot/private/etc/collabd/whitelist.plist.default). I did and all works well, even after restart.  Hope that helps!  -Matt  From over on https://discussions.apple.com/message/25866041#25866041#25866041
