How do I enable cover flow in iTunes 11? <body> I just installed iTunes 11 and I cant seem to find any place to activate the cover flow. Did they remove it? Can I re-enable it? If I can't, does anyone know of a way to downgrade with out uninstalling and re-installing?  EDIT: I am using codeWindows XP/code operating system.  <answer82959> It's gone. You could perhaps look for a different program to browse your library or revert to iTunes 10.  <comment95627> Yes, cover flow is gone from iTunes 11.

Feel free to ask that and link here if you decide to go that way. I'll be sure to help promote that question so you could get an answer.
