How do I do a right click on a 'magic mouse'? <body> We’ve just won a brand new iMac. It came with an Apple keyboard, Magic Mouse and Magic Trackpad. The keyboard works well, although it's weird not having a numeric keypad. The trackpad also works well.  But while the mouse seems to connect fine and I can scroll and click ok, for the life of me I cannot figure out how to do right-clicking on the mouse?  I did try looking for a Control Panel to try and fix this, but there isn’t one.  <answer283889> Hold down the kbd⌃CTRL/kbd key and click with the mouse. This will act as a right click.  Or you can set it up thru strong Apple menu/strong → strongSystem Preferences.../strong → strongMouse/strong and check strongSecondary Click/strong.   <answer283890> There is no emControl Panel/em like in Windows or the old Classic Mac OS systems of years ago. Instead, what macOS has are System Preferences. You can access this from the Apple Menu and selecting the strongSystem Preferences…/strong option.  Once you do you’ll see a list of Preferences Panes you can access by using a single mouse click. There are two you can utilise to address your issue, because both the Magic Mouse and Magic Trackpad can be set up to do what you’re calling a right-click.   Below are screenshots of both the Mouse and Trackpad preference panes:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FzNdc.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FgYxk.png" alt="enter image description here"  Note that when you look at both these preference panes you will see options for a Secondary click.  This is the setting that will enable the right-click you’re looking for.  I suggest while you’re in System Preferences you also have a emplay/em with what else is available.

I'm happy with my Magic Mouse!  (I know you're joking, but in all seriousness, the touch surface + BetterTouchTool is super useful and I definitely recommend it to anyone who likes trackpad gestures but also wants to use a mouse (as long as you get the version that takes AAs)) <comment358132> The problem with the magic-mouse' right-click functionality is that if you're like me and rest your index and middle fingers on the top of the mouse then you have to actively lift your index finger off the left side before you can depress the right-side with your middle finger for a right-click. This got tiring very quickly it's why I returned my Magic Mouse for a refund and got a Logitech mouse with real, actual buttons. <comment358214> This answer was already given.  In addition, the user can change what a 2-finger tap on the mouse does so this answer is not only a duplicate but it's incomplete.  Please edit your answer to include new or updated info.
