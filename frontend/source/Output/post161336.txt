iPhone sent photo <body> So I received a photo from a friend and I have done this with 3 different photos 3 different friends where I saved the photos weeks after they sent them to me and they show up in a photo stream from a week or month earlier. I am wondering does the iPhone save the photos to your photo stream of when they actually took the photo? Is that why I am getting one showing up in my june photo stream that was sent to me in October?   <answer161346> The date of a photo is not determined by when it is saved, but rather, the Exif data embedded in the photo.  <comment188486> possible duplicate of [iMessage picture](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/160148/imessage-picture)
