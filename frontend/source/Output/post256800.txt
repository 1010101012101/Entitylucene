Mouse Keys randomly enabled. How can I prevent this? <body> I'm running macOS 10.12 on a MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015).  Randomly, mouse keys was enabled when my hands were not touching the keyboard. I don't have a bluetooth keyboard (although I do have a bluetooth mouse which I was not using at the time). This is the second time it has happened.  This is either a software or hardware bug, but it seems oddly specific to be a hardware bug when I don't see other random keypresses.   ol liHow can I diagnose this? I can't find any mention of 'mouse' in codesystem.log/code. /li liIs this a known bug?

I have unchecked this box however, and I'll see if it happens again!
