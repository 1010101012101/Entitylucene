Apple TV 2: shared photo folder won't update <body> I have successfully shared photos from my computer to my Apple TV via iTunes, by going to Advance  Choose Photos to Share.  However, when I add photos to that directory, they do not appear on my Apple TV. I have to re-select the folder to share in order to see them on the Apple TV.  Is there a way to allow the folder to auto-update? Or can I specify how frequently the Apple TV checks for new photos?
