RSS reader with Instapaper or Readability integration? <body> One of my main information stream inputs is RSS feeds. Yet many link to long articles on strangely designed web pages, so I regularly read using Instapaper, or Readability.  Is there a RSS reader with built-in integration with Instapaper?  I want to quickly scan lots of feeds, and hit one button to send to Instapaper. Yes I know that I could use Google Reader, on a browser, with the Instapaper extension installed.   I find the web interface of google hard to scan quickly, and I would prefer an offline RSS reader.  thanks  <answer8473> Reeder (for both the iPhone and Mac OS) can send articles to Instapaper.  <answer8493> There are LOTS of them. My favorites are:  River of News for iPad - $3.99.  MobileRSS for iPad/iPhone/iPod - Free/Paid versions.  Reeder for Mac - Free for now while in beta.  If you use Safari, PureReader extension makes Google Reader webapp SOOO much nicer.  By the way, you didn't say which platform you're using.  <answer8494> I'm currently using Gruml, a slightly clunky but useful RSS reader for the Mac. It seems to support a lot of services, including Instapaper. It is also a beta and slightly buggy.  <answer8497> My favourite, Feedler, although only the Pro (paid) version supports Instapaper.  <answer8504> NetNewsWire integrates with Instapaper and also syncs with Google Reader.  <comment9082> Reeder integrates Readability as well as Instapaper. And there's a beta of an OS X version, too. <comment9105> Agree on being buggy - shows promise though. <comment9106> Link to OS X beta: http://madeatgloria.com/brewery/silvio/reeder
