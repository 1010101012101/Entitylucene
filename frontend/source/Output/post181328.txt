How to access Greek symbols on OSX (Mavericks)? <body> I write mathematical computer code.  I frequently need Greek letters such as ø  My current workflow is terrible: hold down OPT and run my finger across the three rows of the keyboard:  precodeœ∑´®†¥¨^øπ“‘« åß∂ƒ©˙∆˚¬…æ Ω≈ç√∫~µ≤≥÷ /code/pre  ... And see if I can find what I'm hunting for.  Failing that, typing 'alpha Unicode' into Google hope for some symbol I can copy and paste.  I discovered that in system settings - keyboard - keyboard, I can "show keyboard and character viewers in menubar".  The character viewer looks like it will come to the rescue, but ... no Greek symbols! ARGH!  What can I do?  <answer181331> In the top left-hand corner of the Character Viewer, there’s a gear icon. The first option is strong“Customise List…”/strong.  This gives you a selectable list of all the character sets available in the sidebar. If you scroll down, you’ll find Greek as one of the options:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zlyAA.png" alt="enter image description here"  I don’t have a Mavericks machine to hand to check, but I’m fairly sure this feature existed before Yosemite.  <answer181334> An alternative - if you know the symbol is in the Opt keys somewhere but just cant remember  Show Keyboard Viewer, then if you hold Opt it will show you the alternatives. You can either complete from the keyboard or click with the mouse to insert at the current carat  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kq9KN.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer181337> υσε υνιγoδειτ.νετ via unicodeit.net Online Demo  It can also be downloaded and installed on a Mac, and put into a Service so it is easily accessible within Keynote and Pages.  <answer247212> Here's the neatest trick I've found for easily getting the Greek letters when I need them. In strongSystem Preferences/strong - strongKeyboard/strong - strongShortcuts/strong I have emSelect the previous input source/em mapped to cmd-space:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HzKym.png" alt="enter image description here"  and then in strongInput Sources/strong I have my standard keyboard and the Greek keyboard:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IGJXb.png" alt="enter image description here"  Now whenever I hit cmd-space my keyboard switches over to Γρεεκ (or vice-versa):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/k7szn.png" alt="enter image description here"  The Greek letters map to the English letters in a much more rational way than what you get with holding option and hunting/pecking. The one caveat is that cmd-space is natively mapped as a shortcut for something else, but considering that I can't even remember what that something else is it wasn't very important.  h3Edit:/h3  For completeness, it turns out that cmd-space is normally a shortcut that brings up a Spotlight search bar.  <comment215635> Thanks, strangely this was greyed-out. But works nevertheless -- thanks! <comment215644> Not sure whether it's just a design decision, but all that top section is in a light grey palette until you click in Search, then it all switches to black on grey <comment215649> ø is in fact not greek, but a Latin character.  You can't get phi φ via OPT. <comment215650> You can use the Grab utility to make screenshots there.  But very few real greek characters are available via opt in any case. <comment215652> @TomGewecke I never thought of firing it up as an app. Cool. <comment215653> I confirm you that your answer is correct on Mountain Lion and Mavericks. <comment215861> Argh! That OPT+d is also not matching the Greek character page. It gives ∂ not δ. What a mess. If only I could re-map the Greek character set behind the European one... <comment215881> Most people would use Character Viewer or switch to the Greek keyboard layout.  If you want to remap the option keys, you can make a custom layout with Ukelele.  Or fool with the substitutions feature in system prefs/keyboard/text. <comment352999> The only thing I would add is that on Sierra I had to switch between the basic and advanced Character Viewer (button in the top-right corner) in order to bring up the menu.
