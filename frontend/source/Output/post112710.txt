Is it possible to disable Personal Hotspot on iPhones with a configuration profile? <body> The company I work for is having an issue with users racking up huge data bills with iOS hotspot tethering. Is there a way we can push a profile that will disable this feature? I have looked through the iPhone Configuration Utility and cannot find any settings for this feature.  <answer113410> If you can't find an option in iPCU, it seems that there probably emisn't/em a way to disable the Personal Hotspot feature. Is there any way that you could cancel the tethering option with your carrier? (If you are unaware, carriers provide tethering as an option that can be disabled/enabled at carrier level at free will.)  <answer156562> usually you are able to produce/edit/setup/maintain/distribute profiles with the Profile Manager as part of Mac OS X Server  <answer221507> As of iOS 9.2, there is no way to disable the Personal Hotspot feature through Configuration Profiles.   The best you can do at the moment is to use an MDM server to report on the status of the Personal Hotspot feature and manually instruct users to switch it off, or arrange to disable it through your carrier.  <comment184076> The asker seems to look for more detailed instructions. <comment242152> If you talking about iPCU, do you mean Apple Configurator or what?
