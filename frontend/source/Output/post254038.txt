How to adjust a script that works in the Terminal but fails in Automator? <body> I have been piecing together a shell script to use FFmpeg to validate video files in a folder and create a log file.   When run in the terminal from that folder, it works fine. When I incorporate it into Automator to use as a service, it fails to create the log file correctly.   It looks like the syntax I'm using causes an issue in Automator, and it's failing as it invokes FFmpeg. How do I adjust my script in Automator to give me the same result as I got in the Terminal?  Here is the script in Automator:  precodefor f in "$@" do     echo "$f" cd $f pwd find -E ./ -regex '.*(.MOV|.MXF|.mp4|.MTS)$' -exec ffmpeg -v error -i {} -map 0:1 -f null - 2&gt;error4.log \; done /code/pre  And the output from the log file:     find: ffmpeg: No such file or directory   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/e4uVr.png" alt="Automator Screenshot"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/x8qSR.png" width="391"  <answer254052> This is because Automator doesn't use your interactive shell's path. You need to specify the location of ffmpeg.  ol liIn Terminal, run:  precodewhich ffmpeg /code/pre/li liReplace the ‘ffmpeg’ in your Automator shell script with the output of this command./li /ol
