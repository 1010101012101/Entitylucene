Time Machine: What files and folders are affected when excluding System Files and Applications? <body> When you put System Files and Applications in the exclusion list, it is not clear what specific files and folders are being concerned.  Is it just the code/Applications/code and code/System/code folders?   Are code/private/code or code/opt/code also excluded? How about code/Library/code?  <answer214136> According to Apple     OS X system files include the System folder and the apps that come with your Mac, such as Safari, Mail, Messages, iTunes, Dashboard, and others.   I'd also like to see a complete list. Based on my own testing (on 10.11.1) I can confirm that code/opt/code is not included and that not everything in code/Applications/code is excluded.  <comment258484> See also http://superuser.com/questions/172216/what-according-to-time-machine-are-system-files-and-applications.
