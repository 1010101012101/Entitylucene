Reliable wireless Battery charging <body> Charging my Iphone 6s with a cable has become a real headache for me, where the cables keep getting "broken" and not charging  Is there an alternative way to charge in a cable-free way?   <answer272487> The technology you may looking for is 'QI wireless charging'.   There are covers like LingsFireÂ® 2 in 1 Qi Wireless Cover (German link) using that technology and there are other approaches like LEAPCOVER Universal-QI Wireless Receiver Patch (German link as well) where you can actually fit it into your iPhone.   I found a link for you addressing that: www.forbes.com/sites/ewanspence/2014/12/11/qi-wireless-charger-iphone-6/#2d1685987fb2  You may also do a Google search with the keywords 'qi' and 'iphone'.  <comment342473> [Maxfield](http://maxfield.de/shop/?lang=en) makes the best iphone wireless charging cases I've ever used. They fit really tight and don't add a lot of bulk. You will need a Qi charging pad to go with the case. Few things to consider: **1.** Most wireless charging cases for iphone won't have a secondary charging port, in which case, you will have to remove the case to charge with a cable. **2.** Drop the phone enough times and these will break too. **3.** Charging is fairly slow and heats up the phone quite a lot. I would not recommend overnight charging.
