Left (or right) border in Apple's Pages <body> I am writing a Pages (5.5.3) document for my Diploma thesis.  I want to create a paragraph style for source code that has a colored border only on one side. Unfortunately, Pages gives me a limited number of options to choose from:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/b39c1.png" alt="Limited positioning of the border in Apple&#39;s Pages"  Is there any solution for achieveing the following style (notice the blue and gray left borders):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Fqk73.png" alt="A slide from Apple&#39;s WWDC presentation on &quot;Building Better Apps with Value Types in Swift&quot;" (BTW, this is a slide from an Apple presentation)  <answer191529> Not with paragraph styles, no. You can do this with a single cell table which can be inlined and have a left border style different to the others.
