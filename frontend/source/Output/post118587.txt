Text "falling" under a table in Mac Word 2011 <body> I'm writing an essay in Mac Word 2011 and I have copy pasted a table from Mac Excel 2011 to my document. If I try to add text above the copied excel-table the text "falls" under the table and the table stays where it is. What I'd expect to happen is that the table would move down whenever I add some more text above it, but this doesn't happen.   When I try to edit my document in Windows with Word 2010 I have no problem with this. If I add some text above the table, it moves more down when text is added sufficiently. If I do the same thing Mac computer with Word 2011, the text "falls" under the table. My problem is that I can't do this with a Windows computer (I tested this with my friends computer), because my own computer is a Mac. How to resolve this problem in Mac Word 2011?  Here is a picture highlighting the problem:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/v2cp7.png" alt="Problem description"  Anyone had similar experience? How to resolve this problem? I have to do this on Mac, because I don't own a Windows computer...thank you for any help! =)   <comment138343> Why close? did I ask this in the wrong stack.exchange site? :) <comment138344> That was close voter's opinion. I agree seems better suited to [Super User](http://superuser.com/). You may wish to flag and ask a mod to migrate it. <comment138345> +1 Thank you for your advice :) I will do that
