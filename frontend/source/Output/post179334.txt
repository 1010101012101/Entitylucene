Is there a way to see what kernel task is doing? <body> I found a question (and answers) about What exactly does kernel_task do?. What I want to know is how I can inspect what kernel_task is doing at any given moment in time?   Does it get logged so that I can inspect what is been doing for a while or can I even observe it at realtime?  <answer179454> There are few places that information is available, but since kernel is multitasking beast one has to look in multiple places:   The simple one is the Console log "type kernel in the filter box", but not all activity is reported there since Kernel issues millions of instructions in a Milli-second.  Also the Activity Monitor is a good source of information.  You could use the codeps -A &gt; process.txt/code to see all running processes.  You could use the codesudo iosnoop/code to see all disk activity.  You could use codekextstat &gt; ~/Desktop/kexts.txt/code to see all loaded drivers.  In other words, it is to busy for you to follow and a continuous output file would not make senses.  <comment212544> possible duplicate of [What exactly does kernel\_task do?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/37366/what-exactly-does-kernel-task-do) <comment212548> That question asks something different than this one
