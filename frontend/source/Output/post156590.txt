Weird folder names in ~/Library/Preferences <body> These empty folders are in my Library  Preferences.  Have I been infected with malware?    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aXLi9.png" alt="enter image description here"  I am running OS X 10.10, Yosemite, with the latest update on a Mac Mini.  <answer156599> It is unlikely your Mac is infected.  The odd folder names within code~/Library/Preferences/code is likely due to a crashing Mac application or process. The crash may be happening within a preferences related section of the application and causing garbage values to be passed to the preferences.  h2Safe to remove/h2  Assuming a reasonable application is responsible for these files, you should always be able to delete contents from code~/Library/Preferences/code without loosing critical information or work.  Delete the folders and check again after running a few of your applications. Do they return?  <comment184128> Any contents in those folders? <comment184130> Restart to your `Recovery HD` open `Disk Utility` and check/repair your main volume (probably named `Macintosh HD`) before deleting anything. The phenomenon may also occur through meta data corruption. <comment184131> As the patterns are similar, there may be something not translating unicode correctly. Is the OS in English? <comment184132> Can you copy and paste some of the file names into your question? Also, what do those names look like if you do a file listing from the terminal? <comment184315> This question was answered by Graham Miln.  But to answer the questions posed to me: The folders had not content, The OS was in English, and the folder names from the terminal is the same as what I posted above. Thank you all.
