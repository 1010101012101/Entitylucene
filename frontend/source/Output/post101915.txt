Switching contact server from Exchange to Gmail <body> I have my contacts on my company's Exchange server. I am now switching jobs and my plan is to export a CSV file with my contacts from Outlook and import that into Gmail, but what should I do on my iPhone (iOS 6) to make the switch as painless as possible?  <comment120041> When you set up your phone to use you google mail. You will be able to get the contacts added also. But I think you need to make sure all the contacts are in the My Contacts group on google or they afaik will not sync over.  It would be a good idea to backup the phones contact one way or other. What most people do not realise that in a lot of cases losing access to the server like google or exchange can mean your contacts disappear from the phone.
