Is there a gesture to drag and drop with Expose on Lion? <body> I know it could be done by pressing kbdF3/kbd button while dragging an item but I really need the five-finger-gesture for that.   On Snow Leopard, I could drag an item with my thumb and then use the remaining four fingers to expose all the apps/windows to drop this item in any app/window in the current space or any other space.  Is there an equivalent in Lion?  <answer37683> I don't know when this has been re-enabled, but in strongOS X Lion 10.7.4/strong I am able to do the following:  ol liClick drag and object in Window A and hold it with your thumb./li liInitiate App Expos√©/Mission Control using a four finger gesture. Do not release your thumb./li liDrag the object to Window B using one of the remaining four fingers. /li /ol  So, this is basically the same as you used to do.  <comment42895> Thnx a lot but unfortunately I can't find this gesture type on the list of touchpad gestures.  Please help. <comment52051> There is no five-finger gesture, and using the available gestures still works. Please explain what the problem is.
