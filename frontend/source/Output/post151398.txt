Yosemite: replace desktop with Launchpad <body> Is there any way to replace the desktop with launchpad?  I would like to do this thing at this point  Kind of gives me the feeling of coming full circle, but ultimately my desktop is just an additional folder full of junk! or completely pristine and free. But I'm never looking at the desktop, ever. So I don't need it.  <comment178182> This is not a viable concept, really.
