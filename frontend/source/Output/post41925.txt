Syncing my iPhone with iTunes restores music I previously deleted from the device <body> One of the new features in iOS 5 is the ability to delete music in the Music app directly on the device, by swiping to delete like you do in Mail. This is great for me because my iPhone is generally pretty full, so as I add new music/apps/podcasts, I can go back through and delete stuff I no longer listen to in order to free up space.  However - when I sync my iPhone with iTunes, it copies everything I deleted right back! It must see that I have music on the computer that I've told it to sync, recognizes that those files aren't on the device, and copies them back over.  Is it me, or is this a bug? What would be the purpose of being able to delete files directly from the device if they get copied back over every time you sync?  <answer41929> You will need to use the strongmanually manage music and videos/strong option - otherwise, as you've already experienced, a sync will restore the deleted music to your device.  Steps for doing this are available at this Apple Support KB:     ol   liConnect the device to your computer./li   liOpen iTunes./li   liSelect iPhone, iPad, or iPod in the codeDevices/code list./li   liClick the codeSummary/code tab and select "codeManually manage music and videos/code"./li   liClick Apply./li   liEven when you have enabled manual management, you can still sync some content automatically. Select any content tab, such as Video, to enable automatic syncing for that type of content./li   /ol   Another KB shows how to use this option to sync music for an iDevice with multiple computers. It also shows a picture of the screen that you'd see:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/g6SeI.png" alt="enter image description here"
