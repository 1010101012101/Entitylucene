How to make newer app runs on OS X 10.7? <body> I just took over an old laptop running OS X 10.7, and it cannot upgrade. I noticed many apps don't support 10.7 anymore. For example, Chrome. I like to know if there is a trick I can do to run these apps (even though they might not actually work). I suspect some plist modification would simply do the trick, I just need to know it.  <comment309096> Possible duplicate of [Is there a Google Chrome version 50 supporting Mac OS 10.8.5?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/237271/is-there-a-google-chrome-version-50-supporting-mac-os-10-8-5) <comment309097> I flagged it as a dupe because while you are on a version of OS X behind the question referenced, the question/answer is essentially the same.  At minimum, this avenue should be explored. <comment309100> I voted to close because it's primarily about Chrome - or if the question were to stay open more generally, application compatibility varies so wildly that a general "how can I make applications work on 10.7" question would be out of scope for this site.
