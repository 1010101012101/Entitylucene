Use multiple speakers to play 2 ch audio <body> My macbook pro has 2 built in speakers and a line-out for audio.  Additionally, I have it connected to my cinema display wich also has 2 speakers.  I want to know how to combine them to use all of them to play my musics so it does't just come from a single output.  <answer17362> I'm not sure but you can try JackAudio. It's powerful multi-sources input/output mixer.  <answer39968> Audio MIDI Setup to the rescue!  Open codeAudio MIDI Setup/code which is located in codeApplications &gt; Utilities/code.  Click the code+/code icon in the bottom-left hand side and choose codeCreate Multi-Output Device/code.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tQfTo.png" alt="Screenshot of the Left-Hand side of Disk Utility"  When the multi-output device is selected, click the Built-In Output, and the Cinema Display's output audio devices.  After this is done, open codeSystem Preferences/code and click the Sound category. Under the codeOutput/code tab, choose the Multi-Output device.  Any applications that were open when you started this process emmay/em have to be restarted in order to pick up the change in default sound devices. Some do, some don't.  I do believe that should do it.  <comment45200> You don't need any external software to accomplish this. <comment169437> The one catch is that you can't adjust the volume of this device (it will be gray on the menu bar). You'll have to Alt+Click on the speaker / volume bar, select one of the sub devices, adjust the volume, repeat for each device, then swap back to the multi device. <comment169571> Or use the Sound preference pane, or Audio Midi Setup.
