Can someone describe how to encrypt a message using someone else's PGP public key on an iPad or iPhone? <body> Can someone describe how to encrypt a message which isn't an email using someone else's pgp public key on iPad or iPhone?  <answer189899> strongiPGMail/strong is not just for email and will do what you want.   Its web page, https://ipgmail.com, includes this sentence:  ul liThe app supports key generation, public and private key import and export, and both encryption and decryption of strongfiles/strong or email messages./li /ul  <comment224921> You're going to need an app for that.  I typed PGP into the app store search box and found one for 99 cents.. i didn't look any further but I'm sure there's more. <comment225130> What was the app called that you downloaded? <comment225131> I didn't download, I confirmed that there was at least one available.  Looking again now there are at least 49 available.  I have no recommendation.
