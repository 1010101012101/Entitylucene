Help needed with Boot Camp Setup <body> I have a 2009 27" Core2Duo 8GB RAM iMac. The hard drive is a brand new 3TB with a fresh install of 10.8.3. I want to install Windows 7 64bit. I set up some basic settings and have a backup at the ready. When I open Boot Camp Assisant and click Continue to the second screen I get this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ez9C8.jpg" alt="Boot Camp Assistant"  There is only one partition formatted as Extended Journaled with 10.8.3 on it. I have tried booting into recovery mode and repairing the disk. I also have done permissions and repair disk from safe mode.  What could be the issue here? I have no idea what to do.  <comment103528> Do you get any errors when you run Disk Utility? <comment103534> I did a check in Recovery Mode on the top level drive (not the volume) and it said it fixed up a whole bunch of stuff pertaining to Windows and EFI partition. The Permissions repair did a couple of things none to do with Boot Camp and the verify turned up clean.
