Computer access to music attached to a very old email address <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   How do I unlock my iTunes account when my old e-mail is unavailable?       For some reason my iPod music located on my computer has re-attached itself to a very old email address and I get an error that states my computer isn't authorized. I'm then asked to provide a password, of course no success there. They can't reset the password because I don't have access to the old email. I tried to add the old email to my current account, with no success. Suggestions?  <comment44930> I have linked to a question with many suggestions on how to reset the password.
