Can't find music transferred from RhythmBox (Ubuntu PC) to iPhone <body> I've transferred a single song to my iPhone 5 through RhythmBox from my Ubuntu PC, however, when I open the "Music" app, it's not showing there. But in RhythmBox, it does show it's present.

Does RhythmBox support that version? It's possible it placed the file on the device, but didn't do so in a way that the the device recognizes it. <comment218987> It's using version 8.3.
