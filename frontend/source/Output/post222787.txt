El Capitan Safari can't open http://localhost/ after starting Apache <body> In the Terminal window, I started the web server with codesudo apachect1 start/code, supplied the password and then got:     /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.apache.httpd.plist: service already loaded   Then, in the Safari Smart Search field I entered:     http://localhost/   Then I got:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/81Daz.png" alt="enter image description here"  In Terminal codehttps -v/code is reported:     Server version: Apache/2.4.16 (Unix)   Server built:   Jul 31 2015 15:53:26   How can we fix this please? Thanks.  <answer222793> Turns out that there is evidence that upgrading from Snow Leopard to El Capitan upgrades the apache2 binaries, but not its configuration. Please get the original apache2 config from a El Capitan clean-install and replace yours with it. It's located at code/private/etc/apache2/original/code. Replace your codehttpd.conf/code and the folder codeextra/code with those you got from the clean install. Restart apache2 afterwards.  <answer233743> In order to efficiently solve the apache problem. We need to open a hidden file which is not available. This is the private file.  Go to your browser Google Chrome or safari and in the address bar place.   precodefile:///private/etc/apache2/ /code/pre  there you will see the apache files within the codeapache2/code folder.  In order to alter this, you must go to Terminal and type:  codeopen /private/etc/code  this accesses the private file. You will see a folder named codeetc/code within this its codeapache2/code open it, go to original folder copy paste the 2 files codeextra/code and codehttpd.conf/code into a new folder on desktop name it what you want we don't care, take the two files codeextra/code and codehttpd.conf/code place them into the codeapache2/code overwriting the existing files is necessary and the localhost should say It works!  <answer244814> type   precodeapachectl configtest /code/pre  into your command line and see what errors you get...  <comment269983> What's the output of `lsof -n -i | grep LISTEN`? <comment269991> does not give any output. only back to the prompt. <comment269992> Do you have the built-in firewall enabled? <comment269996> System Preferences Security & Privacy   Firewall is off <comment269997> `ps -e | grep http` ? <comment269999> 1925 ttys000    0:00.00 grep http <comment270003> Let us [continue this discussion in chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/34060/discussion-between-fred-j-and-max-ried). <comment285621> How does this differ from the other answer? <comment301775> Welcome to Ask Different!

See [answer] for info on what makes up a good answer.  - From Review - <comment334612> @fsb - this is a good answer. This helped me solve my issue as to why localhost wasn't running. Of course you should check for syntax errors in your config file. <comment334621> @AlxVallejo I'm glad the answer worked for you.  I didn't say the answer was good or bad.  This site prefers answers that can 'stand alone' and be as complete as possible (see the link I posted).  To meet that goal, this answer, for instance, should explain what that command would do and how entering that command will address the OP's issue.
