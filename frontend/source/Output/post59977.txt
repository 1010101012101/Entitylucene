How to apply written defaults to a Magic Mouse (com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.mouse)? <body> Running OSX 10.7.4br I wrote a script to swap Apple Magic Mouse secondary click.  The following simple bash script do modify the system preferences (can be seen in System Preferences GUI), but the mouse secondary click is not really swapped.  precode#!/bin/bash mmode=$(defaults read  com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.mouse MouseButtonMode) echo --- $mmode --- if [ $mmode = 'TwoButton' ]; then defaults write  com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.mouse "save.MouseButtonMode.v1" -int 2 defaults write  com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.mouse MouseButtonMode -string "TwoButtonSwapped" echo LEFT HAND MODE else defaults write com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.mouse "save.MouseButtonMode.v1" -int 1 defaults write com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.mouse MouseButtonMode -string "TwoButton" echo RIGHT HAND MODE fi /code/pre  It seems the OS needs some reload/refresh command for the change to take effect. Can anyone figure out what I'm missing?  <answer60043> I couldn't find any way to apply the changes, but you could also use UI scripting to change the setting.  precodetell application "System Events" to tell process "System Preferences"     try         set visible to false     end try     tell application "System Preferences" to reveal pane id "com.apple.preference.mouse"     tell radio group 1 of window 1         if value of radio button 1 is 1 then             click radio button 2         else             click radio button 1         end if     end tell end tell quit application "System Preferences" /code/pre  <comment69022> Have you tried restarting? <comment69031> restarting?! of course not. System Preferences GUI works well. I just need a shortcut script launched to avoid 5 clicks every time I need to swap hands <comment69032> Also, I know it can be done with Automator Watch-Me-Do. But I will need two different Automator scripts since Watch-Me-Do can't be branched <comment69033> Does the setting stay swapped if you close and reopen Sys Pref? <comment69039> if I reopen Sys Pref settings stay swapped but has not effect until I open and click on the currently selected mode. <comment69040> Does this happen with other mice? What about if you restart the mouse? <comment69203> System Events got an error: Canâ€™t get radio group 1 of window 1 of process "System Preferences". Invalid index.  See http://images.apple.com/magicmouse/images/software.jpg <comment69205> I only have 10.8 and no Magic Mouse. If someone gets the script to work with the Magic Mouse style preference pane or in older versions, feel free to edit the answer. <comment69206> Restart mouse? You mean the driver? http://superuser.com/questions/301222/how-to-reset-restart-an-internal-macbook-trackpad-driver-on-os-x <comment69207> unfortunately apple script record won't capture sys perf actions. Automator does, but it won't reveal how it is done. I couldn't find any apple script example similar to the magic mouse windows :-( <comment69214> No, I meant turn it on and off... but that might actually do the trick. <comment69219> Yes it works, but reconnection can only be done via Sys Pref, again with various clicks...no good! <comment79268> @Tal have you tried to relaunch the Finder.app? "killall Finder" <comment79343> @E1Suave. No I didn't. I gave up...The Magic mouse is not worth the trouble as it's a pain to use :-(
