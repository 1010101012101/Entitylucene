Is there any way to see the last location with find my iphone before it was wiped? <body> I lost my iphone three months ago and it was dead so I could never locate it with the "find my iphone" app. Eventually I gave up and did the wipe feature next time it was turned on. I just got the notification that it was wiped. Is there any way to see where it was in that moment it was turned on and before it was wiped?  <answer130697> No, this is not possible. You are not able to see the last location of a device, only the current location, and since you've removed the device you can't obtain any location information.
