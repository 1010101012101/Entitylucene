Streaming iMac's Audio to iPad <body> I want to stream all audio output from my iMac to iPad. By the way, I know, there are only app which named Airfoil for that functionality. But I'm searching inexpensive alternatives.  So do you know any alternative application or method for this topic?  <answer218367> You could compile this yourself: https://github.com/trenskow/AirFloat  <comment264227> I tried it. But I don't want to stream with iTunes only. I want to stream whole audio output from iMac to iPad. Just like Airfoil. <comment264237> Did you try clicking with ‚å• on the volume icon in the menu bar? It should show all audio devices including all airplay devices.
