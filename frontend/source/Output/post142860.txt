Install shuf on OS X? <body> Ubuntu Linux has a great tool called shuf, which works like head except that it gives you ten random lines. I couldn't find it on Homebrew. What is the simplest way of installing it on OS X?  <answer142864> You can install coreutils with codebrew install coreutils/code.  codeshuf/code will be linked as codegshuf/code. Read the caveats when you install coreutils.  <answer195376> Another option is to install coderandomize-lines/code(homebrew) package, which has an coderl/code command which has similar functionality to shuf.  precodeUsage: rl [OPTION]... [FILE]... Randomize the lines of a file (or stdin).    -c, --count=N  select N lines from the file   -r, --reselect lines may be selected multiple times   -o, --output=FILE                  send output to file   -d, --delimiter=DELIM                  specify line delimiter (one character)   -0, --null     set line delimiter to null character                  (useful with find -print0)   -n, --line-number                  print line number with output lines   -q, --quiet, --silent                  do not output any errors or warnings   -h, --help     display this help and exit   -V, --version  output version information and exit /code/pre  <answer195380> You can install coreutils with Macports as   precodesudo port install coreutils /code/pre  This will put GNU core utils in /opt/local/bin with a g prepended   e,g codegshuf/code  <answer195387> Yet another solution is to learn about the tools supplied by the vendor. Certainly you could chain codejot/code, codepaste/code, codesort/code, codecut/code, codehead/code and get the same results.  precodejot -r "$(wc -l FILE)" 1 | paste - FILE | sort -n | cut -f 2- | head -n 10 /code/pre  ul lijot produces a random number from 1 to the number of lines in FILE for each line/li lipaste pastes the random number to each line in FILE/li lisort sorts numeric each line/li licut removes the random number from each line/li lihead outputs the first 10 lines/li /ul  <comment168282> It’s part of the gnu text utilities package. Seems to be part of coreutils, but I don’t know how stuff is packaged on homebrew. <comment168284> The caveat just seems to be that you shouldn't use the tools' proper names, but prefix them with g (like "gshuf"), right? <comment168285> Yep, or optionally configure your PATH so you get what you expect. <comment228183> `brew install coreutils` installs the utils with the prefix `g` by default on osx, so you can install it using the above command. <comment238667> I used this one with macports, thanks. I don't like Homebrew much <comment238799> I really like the essence of this answer, you never know when you might want to do the same thing on another machine where you aren't able to install extra tools for whatever reason
