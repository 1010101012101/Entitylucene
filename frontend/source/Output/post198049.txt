Manually deleting the Safari cookies on Yosemite is not working <body> I am trying to manually delete the cookies for Safari on Mac OSX Yosemite 10.10.3.  I have done this with Chrome and FireFox before (you simply locate their cookie files and delete them). But I seem to fail when trying to do it with Safari.  My understanding is that Safari's cookie files are in  precode/Users/me/Library/Cookies /code/pre  There are at least four files there:  precodeHSTS.plist com.apple.appstore.cookies com.apple.ibooks.cookies Cookies.binarycookies /code/pre  I have closed Safari and emptied the folder. However, it doesn't seem to have worked because when I visit a website that uses cookies for user authentication, I am still logged in (which does not happen when I do it with Chrome or FireFox).  <answer198058> I don't understand the full interplay, but rebooting will fix cookie retention [presumably held in cache] - that is separate from login details remembered by Keychain &amp; also Form Values etc.  If you really want a clean sweep, try OnyX (free/donationware)  Cleaning  Internet - choose what you need to delete from there…  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/h1WGI.png" alt="enter image description here"  Safari has its own simpler version, though I'm not certain quite what it does delete…  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GwxmC.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer273444> Not sure if I fully understand your question, but if you are looking for a way to remove all cookies from Safari via the terminal, without having them regenerated the next time you launch Safari: try the shell script posted below. (I copied this answer from my original post here: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/273442/201104.)  I tested this on macOS 10.12.3 and Safari 10.0.3 and it works.   strongWarning/strong: The tests I did weren't as thorough, meaning: some of the files deleted by this script might not actually be necessary in order to achieve the removal of the cookies, you should trial-and-error your way around it to narrow it down if you like. I personally use the script 'as is', but in your personal situation that might mean you'll lose some data that you actually wanted to keep.   Copy this into a simple shell script and run it (be sure to also copy the 'killall' command):  precoderm -rf ~/Library/Safari/History* rm -rf ~/Library/Safari/Auto* rm -rf ~/Library/Safari/LocalStorage rm -rf ~/Library/Safari/Downloads.* rm -rf ~/Library/Safari/Databases rm -rf ~/Library/Safari/SearchDescriptions.plist rm -rf ~/Library/Safari/WebFeedSources.plist rm -rf ~/Library/Safari/Last* rm -rf ~/Library/Safari/Recently* rm -rf ~/Library/WebKit/com.apple.Safari rm -rf /Library/Cookies rm -rf ~/Library/Cookies rm -rf ~/Library/Caches rm -rf /Library/Caches rm -rf ~/Library/Application Support/Oracle/Java/Deployment/cache rm -rf ~/Library/Preferences/Macromedia/* rm -rf ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Safari.* rm -rf ~/Library/Application Support/com.apple.sharedfilelist/* rm -rf ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.coreservices.useractivityd.dynamicuseractivites rm -rf ~/Library/Preferences/*SpotlightNetHelper* rm -rf ~/.oracle_jre_usage rm -rf ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.sharekit.recents.plist rm -rf ~/Library/Saved*  killall -KILL nsurlstoraged  /code/pre  <comment237288> Do you know which file is the one that contains the actual Safari cookie data? `Cookies.binarycookies` or `HSTS.plist`? <comment237307> Not offhand - delete cookies in OnyX & see which one disappears... <comment343772> Please edit your answer to include all relevant info and not just a link to a different answer.
