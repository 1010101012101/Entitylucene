Can Mac OS X Messages support more than one apple id? <body> I have two Apple IDs, one for work and one personal. My iPhone's Messages settings are bound to my work id. When it receives messages, they pop up on my work computer pretty as you please.  I would like that to happen on my home computer too. If I open strongMessages  Preferences  Accounts/strong on my home computer, I see my home Apple ID listed (along with AIM and Bonjour). I would like to add my work Apple ID as well.  When I click on strong+/strong, I'm offered Google, Yahoo, Aol, and "other" as my choices. And under "other", the choices are "AIM", "Jabber", and "Yahoo"  I emwas/em able to add my work account under strongSettings  Accounts/strong, but there doesn't seem to be a way to connect that to Messages.  <answer247276> You can try going to Messages.app's Preferences (Messages  Preferences) from the menu bar.  Within it there should be a tab 'Accounts' for you to connect your work account to iMessage.  If your account appears greyed out, click it and check 'Enable this account'.  <comment337205> Yes, but can I add a *second* account?
