Why is a application called "java" always open on my OS X 10.9.2 even when I force quit it? <body> Whenever I turn my computer on I have this application open called "java." No matter what I do I can't exit it. When I try force quitting it, it's called "bin." Images below show what I'm talking about:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uRPIc.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YEojH.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer127489> Go to Apple&lt; System preferences&lt; Users and groups&lt; there is two tabs here Password &amp; login items&lt; select login items and remove the app from the list   all the apps &amp; folder added to this section will auto-open when you start up your computer.   <comment149369> show us your Activity monitor, and 30 lines of the console log
