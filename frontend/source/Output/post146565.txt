Option+. prints ≥ instead of being recognized as a shortcut <body> Within the terminal, I used to be able to press kbdOption/kbd+kbd./kbd in order to insert the last argument of the last command into the current prompt. On my new setup, pressing this combination simply prints "≥" (everywhere, not just in the terminal). I'm using US keyboard layout, but I'm on a German keyboard because I don't have any other at the moment.  The shortcut is incredibly useful, how do I get it back working?  <answer146569> If you're on a different system, it may very well be nothing more than your Terminal preferences being amiss. Check Settings | Keyboard and make sure that 'Use option as meta key' is checked.  <comment172707> Awesome, that did the trick! <comment172708> Excellent. Glad to hear it. :)
