How to export a table with transparency from Numbers to PNG? <body> If I copy a table from Numbers to the pasteboard and then create a new document in Preview, it usually works fine, but if cells contain partially transparent background or border colors (especially within gradients), the alpha value is either not kept or itâ€™s more opaque than anticipated.  Maybe this is a limitation of or issue with the PDF format that Preview defaults to, or of the underlying framework. Anyhow, I already reported a bug to Apple.   Meanwhile, is there a way to export a table to PNG while keeping alpha information intact using just system or free third-party tools?  PS: All applications and the OS are the most current released versions, i.e. OS X 10.10.5, Preview 8.0, Numbers 3.5.3.  <comment248109> You can export a numbers doc to PDF. Not sure if this still has the same issue. <comment248166> @IronCraftMan Sadly, it does exhibit the same issue.
