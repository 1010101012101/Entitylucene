Invalid Root Certificate (Comodo RSA) <body> Regulary, a duplicate certificate of COMODO RSA appears on my keychain (Google Chrome?) and when I browse on a website which use a COMODO certificate. Google Chrome blocks the website. (Normal). I muse delete it and restart Google Chrome to be able to open the website.  How it's possible to have this king of duplicate  EDIT: A website using a Comodo RSA Certificate: https://www.graylog.org/   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0j0kY.png" alt="KeyChain Screenshot"  <comment216240> @klanomath https://www.graylog.org/ COMODO is an important certificate provider for certificate. If a delete the invalid one. it works again. <comment216241> I know. There is a known problem with mentioned COMODO RSA CA certificate (expiring date Jan, 19 2038) and IIS-servers run with Windows Server 2003/2008 but visiting graylog.org I don't think they use IIS ;-). <comment216250> @klanomath In fact i don't know on which website this certificate is added but what i said is after i can't visit a website with a Comodo RSA Certifcate like the one on graylog2.org.  Is there a fix for this problem ?
