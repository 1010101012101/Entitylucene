How do I install handbrake cli? <body> I've downloaded the Handbrake CLI. What's the best place to install a command line app on my Mac?  <answer85732> code/usr/local/bin/code is meant for installing local (UNIX) software. Conveniently, it is also included in $PATH by default, so you don't need to prefix the full path to run commands installed there.  You do need root access to install/copy files there, you could accomplish this by using codesudo/code while moving the binary there.  <answer188200> The best way to install anything on OSX is (IMHO) with Homebrew. You can install Homebrew with this command:  precode/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" /code/pre  Then you can install stuff (like codehandbrakeCLI/code) like this:  precodebrew install handbrake /code/pre  Then you can run it straight away from any command prompt with:  precodehandbrakeCLI ... /code/pre  <comment348091> This is out of date (17-03-2017): `brew install handbrake` will install the handbrakecli. After it installs `which handbrakecli` to confirm its existence. <comment348553> @Simon Right you are, updated, thanks <comment372356> Currently this installs on Yosemite as `HandBrakeCLI` -- important for those with a case-sensitive file system.
