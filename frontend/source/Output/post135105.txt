How to reinstall iBooks on Mavericks? <body> I have Macbook Pro Retina with Mavericks. Somehow I uninstalled iBooks. How can I re-install it? I tried Google but did not help.   <answer135118> You can install it from Mac App Store. Just open it, search for iBooks and enter your Apple ID credentials when prompted.  <comment160164> There is no iBooks in App Store. <comment160167> My bad. It comes preinstalled on Maverick. http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/116807/can-i-reinstall-ibooks
