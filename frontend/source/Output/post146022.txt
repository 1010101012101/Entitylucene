App Store Purchase Update gives "An error has occurred" messages for Keynote and Numbers <body> I am trying to install Keynote, Pages, and Numbers from my App Store account using my Apple ID and password. Pages has installed properly and works. Numbers and Keynote both failed and do not open. I'm redirected to try again under Purchases in the App Store. This fails repeatedly in the same way: The download starts, nearly completes, then gives the error message again. The Applications folder in the dock shows a progress bar near completion but does not change.  In one attempt, the apps appeared in Applications but with progress bars frozen. I deleted those files and tried again. Same failure.  I re-indexed the hard drive so that Sherlock could find everything and tried again. Same failure. This is really frustrating!
