Safari loads pages in wrong tab <body> I think this started happening several months ago. I would type an address in a Safari tab (tab 1), then go to another tab (tab 2), which already has a page loaded. After a second or two, while still looking at tab 2, the new page loads there, replacing the original one! Tab 1, in the meantime, doesn't have any page in it.  This looks like a bug. It basically prevents loading any pages in a background tab. This behavior is pretty consistent. Anyone has this problem? Safari 10.0.2, Sierra, 10.12.2.  <comment342737> Noticed this too! One of the (many) reasons I use Chrome/Opera. <comment347570> Definitely is a bug and doing a quick google looks like others are experiencing this too - https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/safari-opening-websites-on-the-wrong-tab.2026188/
