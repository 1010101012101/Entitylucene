How to view man pages in a web browser? <body> Which .conf file do I need to edit in order to view codeman/code pages in a web browser? I'd like to use Google Chrome to do this.  Is this possible?  <answer14538> One way to do this is to put the following command in code~/.profile/code:  precodeexport PAGER="col -b  | open -a /Applications/Safari.app -f" /code/pre  The codePAGER/code environmental variable controls what program codeman/code uses to display man pages. the codecol/code command removes all of the backspace-formatting from the man page. The codeopen/code command saves the output as a temporary text file and opens it with codeSafari.app/code.  Or you can edit the PAGER variable in code/private/etc/man.conf/code. You could also probably edit the codeNROFF/code variable and eliminate the need to use codecol -b/code. See the man page for codeman.conf/code.  <answer14542> You can add a function to your code~/.profile/code:  precodefunction gman {      man "$1" | col -b &gt; "/tmp/$1"      open -a "/Applications/Google Chrome.app" "/tmp/$1" } /code/pre  <answer14544> http://www.bruji.com/bwana/ is exactly what you're looking for.  <comment15674> Thanks Nathan. That does the trick perfectly. I've just altered the line to read: `export PAGER="col -b  | open -a /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app -f"` so it'll open in Chrome instead of Safari. <comment15675> This function wasn't working for me Graham. Not sure why. <comment15676> I'd been wanting to do this for myself anyway, and I'm glad I finally found time to look into it. I used TextWrangler with the command `/usr/bin/edit --view-top --clean -t "Man page"` <comment15677> Cheers. That does look interesting, esp. "We just threw in some color, some bold headers and cleaned it up a bit, so they go easy on the eye." I wonder if I can get such functionality from further editing a .conf file? <comment15679> Is Google Chrome in `/Applications/` or somewhere else? <comment15685> It's in `/Applications/`. <comment262108> Just an additional step. After adding the function in profile folder. Make sure to source it or reopen terminal.
