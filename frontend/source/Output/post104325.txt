How many clients does the airport express support when bridging (ProxySTA)? <body> The airport express is said to support 50 users, yet in my case (when bridging WiFi to ethernet) it only serves up to 4 clients on the LAN port. A fifth client is not able to obtain an IP address nor ARP requests or anything else. It's completely ignored by the airport express.  So: How many ethernet clients does the airport express support concurrently when bridging?  Note: This applies to bridged mode (ProxySTA) only, where one bridges an existing WiFi (connected to the internet) into an ethernet.  <answer127387> I get the same results. Only 4 clients receive an IP from the the main AP. Seems to be an undocumented hard limit on the Express when in client / proxysta mode
