Why are the hidden files/directories seen in Terminal color settings? <body> When I tried to set my Terminal color by importing a color scheme stored in code~/Dropbox/.personal/myColor.Terminal/code, it didn't display the hidden directories, including code~/Dropbox/.personal/code (and other files and directories I store to my Dropbox root, such as code.vimrc/code or code.gvimrc/code).  Why does this not display it? I always show those hidden directories by setting the codeAppleShowAllFiles/code property in codecom.apple.finder/code to 1.  It's just the Terminal color setting import pane that I recognize to NOT be displayed - in other words, I've seen those hidden files everywhere on my daily use.  I can just move the color scheme file temporarily to import it on my Terminal - just want to know why such incongruity occurs.  I use the latest version of OS X Mavericks. Any feedbacks would be appreciated.  h3Update/h3  I got that it's not only Terminal, but it can be applied to other applications as well, on which when you do codeOpen Files/code or codeImport/code or similar operations, most applications don't display those hidden files. As far as I know, only MacVim has a checkbox option to open those hidden files.  <answer128412> If I understand you correctly, this likely has to do with how terminals work. In bash they are hidden by most aliases of codels/code.  Try codels -a/code or code\ls -a/code if that isn't working. This is to show all files and escape an alias you might have.  Put simply, the terminal doesn't care about finder preferences because it emisn't/em finder.    If not, then perhaps terminal simply doesn't respect the finder settings.  <comment150383> Can you see the files in Terminal before you apply the colour scheme? <comment150386> What do you mean in "see files in Terminal"? If you mean `com.apple.Terminal.plist`, then I can see the file's contents by issuing `plutil -convert xml1 -o - com.apple.Terminal.plist`. <comment150387> Does ls show the files before you import the colour scheme <comment150388> `ls -a` (or more simply, just `ls`) properly lists all files including those hidden ones. But I just noticed that it's not only Terminal - most applications don't display those hidden files on the `Open Files` or `Import` or similar dialog. I didn't recognize it... MacVim has an checkbox option to show them, though. <comment150389> Yes, `ls` works properly. And I just noticed that it's not the issue on Terminal - check out my comment to the accepted answer. <comment150390> You should add more information into the question if relevant - Comments should be treated as if they might be deleted in the future
