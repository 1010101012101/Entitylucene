using Microsoft Arc Mouse surface edition on MacBook Air 2015 <body> I have an ARC mouse (surface edition) which i'd like to pair with my macbook air. I'm running el capitan (os X 10.11.1).  from system preferences/mouse I can't even see the mouse. Is there anything else to try?  as far as I understand, my macbook air is bluetooth 4.0 LE compatible. Not sure whether it's bluetooth smart ready though, which the mouse seems to be.  <answer217101> Found a solution.  ol liOpen system settings/bluetooth./li liswitch bluetooth off and back on again, this way it will start scanning for new bluetooth devices/li liclick and hold (for 5 seconds) the button on the mouse to start the pairing process. The led lights on the mouse will flash red and green/li liAfter a few seconds the mouse appears on screen, and next to it a big "PAIR" button. /li liClick it! :)/li /ol  <answer231458> NO, this mouse does not work anymore with 10.10 or later.  <comment262422> Can you find it in system preferences/bluetooth? Make sure the discover button on the mouse is pressed. Bluetooth smart is just some protocol making the process more energy efficient, it should connect anyway edit: damn just too late
