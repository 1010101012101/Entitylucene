How can I make Automator ask the user for a destination directory? <body> How can I make the script output the encoded file in a user defined directory?  I'm trying to build an in-house media file encoder based on Automator and codeffmpeg/code.  I want the source file(s) to be dropped on the app's icon and then ask the user where to output the encoded files.  So far I have an Automator app where I drop files onto it and it runs this AppleScript:  precode    on run {input, parameters}      tell application "Terminal"         activate         set filesString to ""         repeat with file_ in input             set filesString to filesString &amp; " " &amp; quoted form of (POSIX path of file_)         end repeat         do script "for f in" &amp; filesString &amp; "; do  ffmpeg -i \"$f\" -c:v copy -an ${f%.*}_264.mp4  done"     end tell     return input end run /code/pre  Currently the app outputs the encoded file at the same directory as the input file.  How can I make Automator ask the user for and use a destination directory?  <answer189131> h1Automator - 'Ask for Finder Items'/h1  You should probably want to clean up your code. Now you are using emand/em AppleScript emand/em Automator emand/em BASH.  Anyway, in Automator you can ask for a location, store that variable and use it later in your Shell script. You can 'stack' variables in an array by concatenating 'Get Value of Variable'.  Example code and screenshot:  precode# all input arguments echo "${@}"  # The 'Output location' is the first in the stack echo "Output folder location: ""$1"  # Loop through the remaining arguments for f in "${@:2}" do     echo "Video file:""$f" done /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uHdU4.png" alt="automator example"  <comment224111> What is your question? <comment224116> I think you should have your question be reflected in the _Title_ as well. Good luck! <comment224158> In your example, how would this command go: ffmpeg -i **var1** -c:v copy -an **var2**. How would I pass these two variables? <comment224166> You can 'stack' variables in an 'array'. I've updated my example. <comment224800> Thanks @CousinCocaine. I adjusted your example to my needs and sure got a very good lesson.
