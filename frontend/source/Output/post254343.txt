Getting MP4 file out of my Apple iTunes list <body> Previously, I downloaded an MP4 file into my iTunes server.  Now cannot locate the MP4 file on my computer.  Can I extract the MP4 file from iTunes? (again, my iTunes account)  <comment316631> The first thing I notice....is your iTunes server *different* than your computer?  Please clarify (edit your question) If so, why would you expect your particular MP4 be on your computer?  Did you copy it there?
