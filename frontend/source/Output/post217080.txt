How to set a wallpaper for apps in full screen (in Yosemite and higher) <body> Some apps, like Terminal and Textmate, offer transparent windows. With a good wallpaper, this can look really great.  But apps in full screen mode have a black background, not your wallpaper.  Is there a hidden feature or setting to set the background of fullscreen apps to a wallpaper?  <answer217143> It doesn't look like there's a safe way of doing this; looking at this Apple Support Discussion answer, I can still find the referenced background image in my Yosemite install at:  code/System/Library/Frameworks/AppKit.framework/Versions/C/Resources/NSTexturedFullScreenBackgroundColor.png/code  Since this is buried in /System, it's highly unlikely there's .plist file/attribute you could change to point to an alternative background â€“ so you would need to replace this image file with another to change the background. As you may or may not know, editing anything within the /System directory is tempting super-bad juju and strongvery, very, very strongly discouraged/strong by Apple and any IT people worth their salt.  Personally, I would recommend that if you really want a window background image in these apps that you instead configure each app to use the background image and dispense with the transparency (or submit a feature request to Apple and embrace the restriction in the meantime).   <comment262411> This will cause most apps to crash
