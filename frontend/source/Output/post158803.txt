FaceTime window jumps to unwanted position at start of call <body> Running FaceTime 3.0 on MacOSX 10.10.1, there's an annoying behavior that I can't seem to change:  strongWhen I first get an incoming call, the FaceTime window jumps to the far right of my rightmost display/strong (an external 30" Cinema display), strongand can't be repositioned until the call is fully connected/strong (at which point I need to move it more than a yard to the left to center it with the camera in the MacBook Pro).  Why can't the window just stay where I put it?  <answer175689> Similar problem with FT audio. It goes to the upper right too and ends up covering my apps. Easy to move yes, but then it's not on top anymore and I have to dig around for it to end the call.  I poached this AppleScript and tied it to an Alfred Workflow  precodetell application "System Events" to tell process "FaceTime" tell application "FaceTime" to activate tell front window to set position to {950, 696} end tell /code/pre  You could make your own trigger with normal script. Not great, but a quick workaround.
