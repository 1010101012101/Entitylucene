How can I copy a file from a CD when Finder reports error code -36? <body> I have a CD. I copied the whole CD to another location - except for one file. When trying to copy that particular file, I get following error:      The Finder can't complete the operation because some data in   "filename.extension" can't be read or written. (Error code -36)   This file is neither particularly large nor any unusual file type, and I do have the permission to read that file (it's on a read-only CD).  What can be done about that? Thanks in advance!  <answer57843> h1Error code -36/h1  -36 (ioErr) (I/O error) is a file system error, it indicates that data cannot be sent or received by the operating system. Historically, errors of this type were bummers.   h1Finder: source and destination/h1  Think not only of the source (the CD); think also of the destination.   h2The file/h2  What is the one file that Finder can not copy?   h2The file system/h2  What type of file system is the destination? The answer will be amongst results to the following command:   codemount/code  A volume with file system type codehfs/code should be good for most purposes.   Depending on what you wish to copy, other types of file system may be equally good.   h1Disk Utility/h1  For copying a CD in its entirety – or for imaging a file system within a CD – Disk Utility is ideal.   <comment78367> Is the physical cd scratched?
