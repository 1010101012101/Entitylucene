Is it possible to have tabs in Finder? <body> Is there any way to get tabs in Finder? I often need to open many finder windows at the same time and it pollutes my desktop.   <answer4755> With the native Finder app that comes with OS X is not possible to have tabs.br If you really need them you can use some Finder replacement app, like TotalFinder or PathFinder (both not free).  <answer4756> TotalFinder "brings tabs to your native Finder". It's commercial software, however. There are some other Finder replacements as well.  <answer4763> it was already mentioned but PathFinder is an incredible app.  Plus there is a mac bundle site with it on discount right now.  MacPromo Bundle  <answer4767> IMO, I would wait before buying any program/app, as the new OS from apple, aka: lion, will probably address the finder and its shortcomings.   <answer75797> A free alternative for OS X 10.6.8 to 10.8.2 is also XtraFinder, which supports Tabs as well.  <answer107713> Mavericks (MacOS X 10.9) brings us native tabs in the Finder (finally).  <comment4670> don't hold your breath or you might suffocate... <comment4671> They've gone upwards of 9 years without meaningfully changing the Finder. It's simple. Why would they change it now? (iOS Conspiracy Theorists would now way: They will remove it, in Lion.) <comment4672> rubbish.  the finder is going to be updated. <comment4706> @debug: lol, i love your optimism! :P <comment4708> @debug: and in your optimism you’re going to be at least a full year (*at least*) without tabs? I believe TotalFinder works *now*. OS X Lion? We’ll see, but that’s probably a year from now… <comment4711> @calavera: thanks.  @MartinM: you make an excellent point.  Read OSX book. has a lot of history of the whole OS itself, and why Mac  OS X is so awesome, powerful http://www.osxbook.com/ <comment4785> When I need more screen real estate I set up a couple Screens and bounce between them. My Mac Pro at work has two monitors on it, and I have four workspaces set up, and am jumping back and forth all the time. <comment8342> I wouldn't classify TotalFinder a "replacement", but PathFinder sure seems like a replacement and consequently comes with a slight learning curve. TotalFinder is simple in that it only adds one real big feature; tabs. A recent update has also added cut & paste. The other features are relatively minor and most folks won't touch them. <comment63735> @Randy6T9 One added feature I like about TotalFinder is "Folders on Top". <comment89216> Came here to say this.
