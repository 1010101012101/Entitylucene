Airport Disk - How can I access it over the Internet without iCloud or Back to my Mac? <body> Airport Disk -  How can I access it over the Internet without iCloud or Back to my Mac?  I have enabled the "access disk over WAN" option but when I try the ip nothing happens.  The ip is correct, I always have the same one and I've used it to connect remotely to my desktop.  Anyone? I've read somewhere Apple disabled this?!  PS. I've already read this Access disk attached to Airport Extreme over internet? and it does not fix my issue?  <answer144998> Did you specify volume name in the afp url?  http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4538  <comment213011> I'll try it and report back.
