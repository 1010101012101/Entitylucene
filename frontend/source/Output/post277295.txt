Korean ID3 tags used to work in iTunes but now do not display correctly <body> I had an iTunes library on a Mac mini where all of my Korean mp3s showed up fine (I had made sure they were all in Unicode).  On moving these files to a newer MBP (running the latest iTunes, 12.06), most of the info for these files is coming up garbled. Some change back into Korean when I play them, others don't.  I have tried File  Convert  Convert ID3 Tags  Reverse Unicode (didn't work at all).  I've also tried adding them using File  Add to library, and putting them directly in the "Automatically add to iTunes" folder (still doesn't work).  Any suggestions?
