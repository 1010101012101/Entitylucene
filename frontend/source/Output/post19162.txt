Where are all these ipfw rules coming from? <body> Any attempt to connect to a server over port 143 is blocked by the OS. I've verified it's not my connection; other computers on the network can see the port just fine. I've replicated the problem on a different network, as well as both the Ethernet and Wifi interfaces.  On my Macbook, I get this:  precode$ telnet mail.xxxx.com 143 Trying xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx... telnet: connect to address xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx: Permission denied telnet: Unable to connect to remote host  $ telnet mail.xxxx.com 110 Trying xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx...

I've discovered that disabling the ruleset they belong to lasts longer:  precode$ sudo ipfw set disable 0 /code/pre  But they still get re-enabled after a reboot.  <answer38160> They are coming from /etc/ipfilter/*  <comment20986> I upgraded from 10.6 to Lion; I don't have any of these in my table. <comment20988> @NReilingh this was so weird. It was blocking my network printer as well. Still have no idea where they came from. <comment20989> @NReilingh I even did a fresh install of Lion, wiped my partition first. <comment20992> The ipfw rule list isn't even preserved across reboots, so it must've been something installed on the computer, running at startup, setting up the rule list. Wiping and reinstalling *will* fix that... <comment21200> @Gordon You're right, a flush is only a temporary measure. Where could rules be stored? I don't have `/etc/firewall.conf` and I can't find a plist for it. <comment43248> Nope. OSX doesn't have /etc/ipfilter
