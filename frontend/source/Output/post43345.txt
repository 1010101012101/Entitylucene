Is there a better way to shutdown/restart OSX? <body> Whenever I want to shutdown/restart OSX I click on the menu, select shutdown, and then click the box for not saving the session, and then click OK. Then there's always at least one program that interrupts the shutdown process.   Is there an easier way to do this? Maybe by using the terminal? I was thinking of codeshutdown -h now/code, but that way seems kind of "dirty." What are some ways to do it?  <answer43348> Typing KBDCtrl/KBD + KBD⏏/KBD brings up the shutdown dialog window, which is a bit faster than clicking the Apple menu.  <answer43349> If you don't care about saving the session, you can simply hit KBDCtrl/KBD + KBDOption/KBD + KBD⌘/KBD + KBD⏏/KBD for Shutdown or KBDCtrl/KBD + KBD⌘/KBD + KBD⏏/KBD for Restart  You can also check out this post (Disable "Reopen Windows") on disabling resume if you don't want that. There is another solution posted here on Apple's forums for disabling the feature by William Donelson (second post by him on the page).  <answer98756> This can all be controlled by a Preference. Below is for Mountain Lion, which was changed slightly from Lion:  ol liApple Menu - System Preferences/li liGeneral (under Personal section)/li liSelect "Close Windows when quitting an Application" - this makes it so windows don't open when you reopen an app./li liNow when you shut down (and tell it not to reopen windows on restart) they will not open then - or later./li /ol  <answer98788> Functional is a collection of utilities bringing the basic Mac OS X functions from the Apple menu to your Dock. It is the spiritual companion of 'Hypnotize'.  Add the Functional folder as a stack to the Dock, and strongLogging Out/strong, strongRestarting/strong, strongShutting Down/strong or strongSleeping/strong your Mac will be just a mouse-click away.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rR7aX.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6X3kg.png" alt="enter image description here"  A review of strongFunctional/strong along with its companion strongHypnotize/strong can be found here.  <comment49241> +1, that's a better answer than mine, I didn't know about those extra key combinations. Thanks. :-) <comment49245> @binarybob Thanks, picked them up from some article I read a long time ago, then I wrote them down for reference ;) <comment49254> The funny thing is I didn't actually know this one ;) <comment49266> Pressing the power button also brings up the Shut Down confirmation window. <comment159021> This still can be stopped by an application <comment177456> How does this deal with "Then there's always at least one program that interrupts the shutdown process." <comment373838> @binary, Where's that up button on macbook pro touch?
