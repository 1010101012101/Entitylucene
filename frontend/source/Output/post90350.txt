Mac Excel Control Shift RIght Arrow <body> It's been a while since I used Excel on a PC.   In Excel on a PC, I believe if you have a set of data and want to select all the cells in the same row from where the cursor is to the last cell below a set of data, you could use kbdCtrl/kbd - kbdShift/kbd - kbd&#x2190;/kbd. On a Mac (Excel 2011) this selects all the cells until the end of the entire row.  How on Excel 2011 (Mac) can I select all the empty cells in a row until beneath a set of data?   The reason for doing this is if I want to copy the current row and paste that to another row of data. I should be able to copy the current row, then hit down, then (I thought) kbdCtrl/kbd - kbdShift/kbd - kbd&#x2190;/kbd, then paste and I would paste in another set of data.  <answer90351> I found it:  kbdFn/kbd + kbdShift/kbd + kbdOption (Alt)/kbd + kbd&#x2190;/kbd  <answer210630> "Command" "Shift" "Arrow" on Mac can do the same as "Ctrl" "Shift" "Arrow" on PC.
