Can I block my ID when making a FaceTime Call? <body> Is there a way to initiate a FaceTime call but block my identity from the person I'm making the call to? Reason: my daughter has lost her privilege to use FaceTime, but I looked at her Apple account a few minutes ago and it said that her iPhone was using FaceTime at the moment. I want to find out if she is, in fact, breaking the rules. Thank you.  <answer174149> No, you can only set your Caller ID to one of the email addresses associated with your Apple ID, accessible through Settings &rarr; FaceTime.  <answer250007> That's not necessarily true.  I just received a FaceTime call from "unknown".  8/18/16  <comment205064> `Settings  General  Restrictions` might be your friend. <comment310250> Could you flesh this out with an edit to make it a stand alone answer?
