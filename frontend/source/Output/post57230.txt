Can't get Apple Hardware Test to work <body> So I'm trying to run the Apple Hardware Test. I start the computer up and hold "D". It boots into OS X like a normal startup. So, I plug in the Ethernet and hold option-D to do the AHT from the Internet. It tells me "Apple Hardware Test does not support this machine".  So, I try to install the "iMac EFI Update 1.8" from http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1493 (which is for my iMac model, which is a iMac (Mid 2010)), but it says "This software is not supported on your system." I also tried the later version, v1.9, from http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1498 but it isn't for my iMac and so I get the same error.  I also tried putting in my DVD 1 for my iMac, then starting up by holding both "D" and "option-D", but neither booted AHT from the DVD.  So now I'm stuck. What should I do now?  <answer57233> Do you have another mac? Can you boot the problematic machine in Target Mode (boot holding the T key). Connect to the other mac and run system utilities (Disk, etc) from there.  What is the problem with your computer that requires you to run AHT?  Hope this helps.  <answer57295> Okay, so I finally got it working by inserting DVD 2 rather than DVD 1. It clearly indicated on the DVD that it has Apple Hardware Test, which I missed the first time. This could be useful to those who have a similar problem to mine, I suppose.  <comment88629> Brilliant!! I've been trying to get into AHT for 2 days now and made the same mistake, popped in the second disc and all done in 15 minutes - marvellous!
