Is there a way to display more metadata fields in the Finder list view? <body> If I view and sort files in a directory using Finder's list view I seem to be limited to a rather anaemic:  ul liName/li liDate Modified/li liSize/li liKind/li /ul  Now, take an .mp3 file for example. There is potentially a lot of metadata associated with that file, and this may be a useful basis to sort by.  Is there a way to make available more fields to sort by? Or do I need to resort to a Finder replacement? I realize that iTunes could do most, but not all, of what I want. (iTunes doesn't display some .mp3 metadata fields.)  <answer11889> I'm pretty sure you're (sadly) limited to the fields in the view options windows (kbdcmd/kbd+kbdj/kbd).  <comment12538> I think you may be right. I was hoping there was some command-linefu that could be done to expose some more fields.
