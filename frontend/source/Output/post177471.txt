How to show vi mode in bash? <body> I'm on Yosemite, using vi mode in bash (codeset -o vi/code in .bash_profile) and I want to have the prompt indicate if I'm in edit or command mode.  I looked around and found that this feature has been implemented in bash 4.3 (see https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/116385/46076) and can be turned on by setting the variable codeshow-mode-in-prompt/code to codeon/code.  I installed bash 4.3 using homebrew following these instructions.  Now, when I execute codebash --version/code I see codeGNU bash, version 4.3.33(1)-release (x86_64-apple-darwin14.1.0)/code and codebrew info readline/code returns codereadline: stable 6.3.8 (bottled)/code so it looks like I'm using the correct versions.  However, when I execute codeset show-mode-in-prompt on/code or add it to ~/.inputrc based on the readline manual, the prompt still doesn't change based on the vi mode.  What am I doing wrong?  <answer177590> Looks like I didn't do anything wrong and an additional reboot is all that was needed.  <answer238266> In my situation, although codebash --version/code shows 4.3.42(1)-release, codeecho $BASH_VERSION/code still showing 3.*, then I realize the default bash haven't been changed, please refer to this link: terminal - Update bash to version 4.0 on OSX - Ask Different  <answer241724> put bind 'set show-mode-in-prompt on' into bash_profile ;) don't thanks me.  <comment209951> emacs is better than vi.
