2730 unread emails <body> I have an iPhone 6+ and my mail icon shows 2730 unread emails. When I go into email, there aren't any unread emails, let alone 2730. I have no idea how to find them to remove the alert saying I have unread email. Can you help?  <answer269234> Your question does not specify what you've already tried (if anything)?   There can be a number of causes for this problem, and many possible solutions. For now I'll offer a couple of easier solutions since I don't know what you've already tried.  strongSolution 1 - Just remove Mail notifications altogether/strong  If all you want to do is remove the emalert/em, then follow these steps:  ol liGo to your iPhone Settings/li liTap on Notifications/li liSwipe up until you see the Mail app listed/li liTap on Mail/li liDisable the emAllow Notifications/em toggle/li liExit Settings/li /ol  Now the incorrect tally of unread emails is gone.  If you want to keep the notification, but just want it 'fixed', then there are a lot of possible solutions. I offer one of the more common ones below:  strongSolution 2 - Temporarily switch off your email account(s)/strong  ol liGo to your iPhone Settings/li liSwipe up until you see Mail/li liTap on Mail/li liTap on Accounts/li liSelect the mail account that shows the unread messages/li liToggle the emAccount/em off/li liFully switch off your iPhone by holding down the power button for about 5 seconds and swiping the emslide to power off/em prompt/li liWait for at least 30 seconds/li liSwitch your iPhone back on/li liFollow Steps 1 to 5 again and then skip to Step 11 below/li liToggle the emAccount/em on again/li /ol  Now check whether your Unread Email count is correct?  strongNOTE/strong  If solution 1 is strongnot/strong what you want to do, and Solution 2 does not resolve your issue, there are many other possible solutions. Please update your question to include what else (if anything) you've already tried. Also include how many email accounts you have set up on your iPhone and whether or not an iCloud email address is one of them. By doing this I (or someone else) will be able to offer further advice.  <comment338075> Are you running the latest iOS available? Have you tried restarting your iPhone? Have you tried emptying the trash in your email client? <comment338134> How is your iPhone accessing the mail server - via IMAP or POP? If via IMAP, can you see any unread messages in folders other than the inbox? Perhaps going to the webmail site for your provider can give you an idea of if there are messages anywhere that are unread.
