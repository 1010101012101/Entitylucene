How can I respond in a definitive fashion to an app pestering me about a permission? <body> Why?  In that case, I think of Steam, which keeps requesting access to the Accessibility Panel. I don't think I want that, because Steam is not an Accessibility tool.  What?  I'd like to say "No, I don't want to give you access, stop asking".  NOTE: Buscar's answer clearly explains why it needs to be accessed, which makes the problem a non-problem.  <answer147770> Enable &amp; Control Access for Assistive Devices &amp; Apps in OS X Mavericks     For example, many popular games will require access to the Assistive   Devices abilities so that an online game can properly use voice chat   or screen broadcasting. This is true with nearly all Steam games,   ranging from Team Fortress 2 to Civilization V, and Blizzard / Battle   Net games like StarCraft 2 and World of Warcraft. Note these games   will continue to function without Assistive Access, but their feature   set for online communication and sharing may be limited, and thus if   you’re playing games and find the voice chat features aren’t working,   this setting or app-specific access could very well be the reason why.   You can not send a replay to it, but you can disable it in your sys pref security and privacy, and/or in the game set up.  <comment174189> Other than blocking it (silently) there is no such thing as fashion reply to it.
