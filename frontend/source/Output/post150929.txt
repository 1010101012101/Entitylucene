Monitoring wifi data bandwidth usage on ipod touch <body> How can a person get per-app network data usage information on iOS (iPod Touch)?  On my phone (Nexus 5) I get a breakdown for mobile (cellular) or WiFi, for arbitrary dates, for specific apps, and foreground/background in those apps; see screenshots. (Only thing missing is being able to slice by WiFi connection, to see difference between home WiFi and others.)  Ever since the kids got iPods we're using up our internet bandwidth quota well before the end of the month. I want to identify which apps are causing problems and give them the boot, pronto. The alternative of disabling internet access for the wunderkind is not going to make me popular!  So, how can I get similar usage information for iPod Touch?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/H5Iit.png" alt="Nexus 5 wifi data usage screenshot"
