It's very disruptive and makes it very difficult to complete even simple tasks. You may have a defective digitizer or loose connector. Has your phone recently experienced any drops or hard impacts? Your best bet is to visit an Apple store and have the screen/digitizer replaced.   <answer245435> I've seen that issue before. You will need to take your device to Apple or an Authorised Service Provider for service. See https://locate.apple.com to find your nearest service location.  They will most likely replace either the whole Display part or the device itself.
