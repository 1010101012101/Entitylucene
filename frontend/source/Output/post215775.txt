Generate the averaged color for the cell based on a range of other colored cells <body> I have a range of cells, each one is colored in yellow, green or red. I want to have a "total" cell, that shows me "averaged" color. Here is how my table looks like: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NhRTC.png" alt="enter image description here"  Is that possible to do with Numbers ?  <comment260669> Where does the current coloring of the cells above come from? Do you set a color manually or is there some conditional formatting based on cell value? <comment260876> @patrix set a color manually <comment260996> What exactly do you want in the cell?  "Averaged" as in number of Green Yellow or Red?  Or a color representing a blend of colors based on the column?  Not quite sure what you mean by "averaged color"? <comment261231> @bjbk I want a blend of colors
