macOS Sierra: invalid active developer path <body> After upgrading to macOS Sierra, I tried to run codegit/code from Terminal but it kept giving me the following error:  codexcrun: error: invalid active developer path (/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools), missing xcrun at: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/xcrun/code.  How do I fix it?  <answer254381> Open Terminal, and run the following:  codexcode-select --install/code  This will download and install xcode developer tools and fix the problem. The problem is that one needs to explicitly agree to the license agreement.   I found the solution in this question, Command Line Tools not working.  <answer265049> strongIf you don't want to install nor use Xcode/strong (I don't) you can install only  command tools for Xcode  h3Preconditions:/h3  ul liyou have AppleID/li /ul  h3Solution/h3  Go to https://developer.apple.com/download/more/ and find strongCommand line tools OS X 10.11) for Xcode 7.1/strong.

Then all git stuff ran smoothly.  <answer283691> The accepted answer is correct, but also note that git does not make it obvious if the error is coming from remote or from local. If you are running OS X on your remote, your install problem may be on the remote side and you'll see the same error on codegit clone/code and codegit pull/code but NOT on codegit status/code.  <comment332939> You'll need to log in with your Apple ID in order to complete the download. <comment332968> Yes. But for me that's not the issue. The issue is that I don't want to install full Xcode. I'll update the answer with this info <comment334681> This solution dit not help me. I tried `xcode-select --reset` and it helped! <comment357699> Welcome to Ask Different! Please refrain from adding comments in the Answer section, this is for answers to the questions.

Everything still works - so I suppose you can just use the newest version :) Please write me a comment after you try <comment361723> @michalczukm I'm on macOS 10.12.5 and installed the latest version (I think it was CLT for macOS 10.12 for Xcode 8.3) and it worked fine.
