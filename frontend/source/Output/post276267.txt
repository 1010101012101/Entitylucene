Mac terminal - Displaying file permission when changing directory <body> When I change a directory in terminal, the output is displaying the write permissions I have for every file in that destination folder. I'd prefer this didn't happen.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DUBUd.png" alt="enter image description here"   I assume there is something i need to tweak in my bash_profile, but have yet to locate it. Any help would be appreciated.   <comment347644> you can find your bash_profile using: `touch ~/.bash_profile; open ~/.bash_profile` <comment347645> Please post the (redacted - if necessary) content of your .bash_profile which is a invisible file in your home directory: `cat ~/.bash_profile`! To save its content to a txt file on your desktop use `cat ~/.bash_profile  ~/Desktop/profilecontent.txt`. <comment347676> Here's a link to the whole profile  http://www.filehosting.org/file/details/649166/bash.txt <comment347836> @LvcasX1 Sorry, I should have been more clear. I have access to my bash_profile, I'm just unclear as what to set to avoid the permissions popping up.
