What features from Lion will be lost when upgrading to Mountain Lion? <body> I know Mountain Lion has some cool new features that Lion did not have, but will it overwrite any of Lion's functionality?  <answer57460> Of course.  In adding features, the behavior of previous features changes, not always for the better.  strongemIf you find features that were present in Lion but missing in Mountain Lion, please edit this answer to add your contributions to this list./em/strong  ul liMountain Lion drops support for some models of Macs supported by Lion./li liClicking the top right corner no longer triggers Spotlight (Spotlight's menubar icon is still present, adjacent to the new Notification Center icon)./li liThe battery indicator in the menubar will no longer offer to show the remaining time./li liX11.app is included, but that app alone no longer provides X11 functionality.

There's a pretty extensive community built list at http://roaringapps.com/apps:table/.  <answer58288> h1Disk Utility may lose the ability to present S.M.A.R.T. status/h1  The underlying cause, as I see it: in Disk Utility, a physical disk may be invisible.  h2Without Disk Utility/h2  S.M.A.R.T. status will be visible in System Information, or with a command such as this:  precodediskutil info disk0 | grep SMART /code/pre  <answer58554> One of the bigger-deal removals for some is the 'Web sharing' button in the System Preferences  Sharing tab that controls Apache. Apache is still there, and can be manually set up, but the old one-click solution is gone. That was one of the things I used to demonstrate to people new to the Mac that they found astonishing.  <answer58615> Safari 6 removes the ability to change the default fonts in webpages (see Safari 6: How to change default fonts?).  Note that this will also happen even if you upgrade to Safari 6 in Lion.  <answer58843> h1Safari Changes:/h1  h3Activity Window Missing:/h3  Prior to Mountain Lion, there was an Activity window that could be opened from "Safari  Window  Activity". Now however, that functionality is no longer available. I found the Activity window to be especially useful for downloading videos from sites like YouTube. I'm sure there were many other uses for it, but that was what I primarily used it for.  h3kbdDelete/kbd Button No Longer Goes to Previous Page:/h3  In Lion, one could navigate to the previous page in Safari by pressing the kbddelete/kbd key, but in Mountain Lion this feature is no longer active by default (in Mountain Lion it's kbdCmd/kbdkbd[/kbd). However, you can activate it with this terminal command:  precodedefaults write com.apple.Safari com.apple.Safari.ContentPageGroupIdentifier.WebKit2BackspaceKeyNavigationEnabled -bool YES /code/pre  <answer59868> ul liSafari doesn't have separate source windows/li liCalendar doesn't support scheduling scripts/li liThe option to disable smooth scrolling was removed/li liThe tab for installed updates was removed from the Software Update preferences/li liMail doesn't support notes/li liNested menu titles like code&gt;File&gt;Duplicate/code no longer work in the keyboard shortcut preferences/li liOld files cannot be locked automatically/li liSafari doesn't have RSS buttons/li /ul  <answer66427> MAIL has lost its progress bar and also the belly-button indicators by each mailbox... so you don't know when servers are being checked, or when mails are being sent or downloaded nor how they are progressing... or not.  Also, MAIL has lost its DELETE button, so you have to use the Delete button on the keyboard.  Minor hassle, but why add hassle?  <comment67008> With respect: for some points – especially those likely to generate commentary – a separate answer may be desirable. <comment67025> As for RSS: the old archives are still left in `~/Library/Mail/V2/RSS`. No idea how to use those though. :-( <comment67399> I found http://clickontyler.com/blog/2012/02/web-sharing-mountain-lion/ to be a handy way to get one-click control over Apache. <comment69937> For the **Activity window of Safari**, there's an [answer](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/60230/8546) under [How to regain features from Safari 5 that are not found in Safari 6?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/58812/8546); more answers under [How to mimic Safari 5 Activity window with Mountain Lion, to save FLV video files?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/59449/8546). <comment71047> They dropped support for notes in Mail already? Didn't they just add that feature in Lion? <comment71048> I don't remember if they added support for iCloud notes in Lion, but Mail supported IMAP notes in 10.6 and earlier versions. <comment71482> They removed notes from Mail, but made Notes its own app.  The feature still exists, just not as part of the email program. <comment78148> All of these are still available. But you have to search for these options a little. To see the progress bar, click on *Hide* (top left) and the little triangle on the bottom left. The delete button is the *trash can* which is shown in the default layout of the toolbar. You can customize the toolbar by right-clicking it.
