Reading List in other browsers? <body> Is there a Reading List extension for Chrome? I have a deep, dark hatred of Safari, but Reading List seems more convenient than Pocket of Readability. Or, is there a way to access it by any non-safari means at all?  <answer51535> All reading list is a simple wrapper around bookmarks, that allows you quick access to both add and remove entries.  It's usefulness stops there really, and the matter of convenience boils down to what you want to use the stored pages for, and how you wish to access them.  If you are just using the same computer and will always have a net connection, then yes it's very convenient, but if you want to have them stored offline and synced to multiple devices, then it's not so useful.  I don't use Chrome, but I would probably look to get an extension  for either Pocket/Readability/Instapaper to mimic the reading list feature, by making your recently stored pages available from a toolbar button rather than having to login to the respective sites.  This gives you all the added benefits of using a proper 'service', with the instant nature of a quick bookmark system.  A quick search for "instapaper" yielded 50 results on the Chrome extension store thing   <answer51536> On a Mac the reading list is stored in code/Users/notjonathan/Library/Safari/Bookmarks.plist/code so potentially there is a tool out there to read them automatically. The actual syncing is done by Safari. It doesn't just watch the file for changes and upload the changes. You actually have to make the changes from within Safari.  So what you're "stuck" with using services like Pocket, which although slightly less convenient in iOS safari, is imo better. Especailly as other apps, e.g. Tweetbot can integrate with Pocket, but not Safari Reading List.  There is bookmarklet for Pocket available, which you can use in iOS Safari to quickly add pages, with just a few more presses than pressing Add To Reading List.  <answer70671> You can add things with AppleScript according to this: http://jga.me/blog/2011/10/18/applescript-readinglist  So it should be easy to cook up a Firefox extension to call that bit of AppleScript, you can call it form the shell like:  precodeosascript -e 'tell application "Safari" to add reading list item "http://totl.net/"' /code/pre  Which will cause Safari to generate the preview and send it to iCloud, or wherever it goes to.  <answer121935> To add the active tab in Google Chrome to Safari's reading list:  Adapted from a comment by tzarskyz on: Add a URL from Chrome to Safari's reading list  precodetell application "Google Chrome"     set pageUrl to get URL of active tab of first window end tell tell application "Safari" to add reading list item pageUrl display notification pageUrl with title "Added to Reading List" /code/pre  Open AppleScript Editor and save the above code as a new script.  From that point on, you can run this script to add the active tab in Google Chrome to Safari's reading list.  You can trigger this action via Terminal (codeosascript/code), by double-clicking the script (in Terminal or on your desktop), via an app launcher like Quicksilver, via Fastscripts, etc.  Enjoy your reading! :)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RWypf.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  Update: I've since found a better way to accomplish this, without requiring something like Fastscripts.  Simply use OS X's built-in application, Automator.  You can adapt the steps outlined at the following link to run the AppleScript I included above: Global HotKey for Pause/Play,Next Song, etc.   <answer227621> I've made a fork of CloudyTabs with Reading list support, clone it at https://github.com/cl3m/CloudyTabs  <answer232995> Just a quick addition here.  I love the small menu application called PopClip.  It enables many different functions to be peformed on highlighted text.  One such add-on function is: "Add to reading list."  Worked like a charm for me (and is system wide- so even links within e-mails can be added).  Apple AppStore app maker's page: https://pilotmoon.com/popclip/  <comment58916> Doesn't "answer" much, but clarifies a lot :D <comment143893> This is awesome -- I added this exact script to my documents and run Alfred to quickly save to Reading List. Cheers! <comment143894> Glad it helped, @mjb!  Have a great day, and happy reading! :) <comment181703> The script worked for me but with a minor modification - remove "Google" so it is just "Chrome" Tell application "Chrome" set pageUrl to get URL of active tab of first window end tell tell application "Safari" to add reading list item pageUrl display notification pageUrl with title "Added to Reading List" <comment198939> I'd recommend to close Safari afterwards since we're not doing anything with it there is no need to keep it open. Add this to the eend of your script `tell application "Safari" to quit` <comment306407> This answer is no longer accurate. Reading List downloads the pages and makes them accessible offline, so theyâ€™re much more convenient now. <comment314085> Yep, the Reading List also syncs between your devices, which is very handy when saving something to read later on a phone.
