Recovering iWork from backup <body> I recently changed my MBP 13" 2009 to the newer MBP 13" 2012. I decided not to recover from Time Machine and install everything manually as to make a clean start.     Although I do not have my iWork '09 disk with me. Is there a way to   recover it from the backups? Simply copying the application does not   work.   Also I am not able to download it from App Store, because I bought it from a retail store and not online.  <answer69289> You also need to recover library files:  precode/Library/Application Support/iWork'09 /Library/Preferences/com.apple.iWork09.installer.plist /Library/Preferences/com.apple.iWork09.plist /code/pre  In my case, this was the minimum requirement to get Keynote starting again.   Additionally, you might want to recover user-specific files from your user directory:  precode~/Library/Application Support/iWork ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iWork.* /code/pre  <comment80597> Marked as accepted answer even tho I havent tried your suggestions. I got access to the install DVDs which solved the issue. <comment113993> I had some problems with iWork, so I ended up with installing OpenOffice for Mac. <comment114069> I havent tried OpenOffice so cant compare them. Im quite happy with iWork though, it havent had any problems with it so far. <comment137903> I can confirm that guwac's approach works.
