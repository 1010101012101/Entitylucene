How to check system process battery usage information on iOS 8? <body> With iOS 8, It was made possible to get relevant battery usage for applications on iOS. Is there any way to find the battery usage of the system processes on iOS 8? I'm looking for Jailbreak tweaks or Diagnostic tools because there aren't any other options.  <answer163005> strongDetailedBatteryUsage/strong Cydia tweak from the BigBoss repo shows the battery usage for system processes. It integrated right into the codeBattery Status/code tab inside settings and throws in a neat battery life cycle graph for the last seven days and also displays information about active usage/background usage.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZC2ic.png" alt="enter image description here"
