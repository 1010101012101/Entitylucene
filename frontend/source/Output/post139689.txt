Simulate Page Right and Page Left <body> is there any way to simulate a "Page Left/Right" functionality? With kbd⌃ Ctrl/kbd+kbd↑/kbd or kbd⌃ Ctrl/kbd+kbd↓/kbd (or kbdfn/kbd+kbd↑/kbd or kbdfn/kbd+kbd↓/kbd or any of the other various ways) I can scroll most Mac windows up or down "a page". However the behavior for left and right is very inconsistent or not present. I really would like to do the same for left and right directions.  <answer139700> In Safari and other web views option-left (⌥←) scrolls a page left and option-right (⌥→) scrolls a page right, but it doesn't work in Chrome.  You can use DefaultKeyBinding.dict or Karabiner to make some key combinations move in different directions multiple times:  precode{   "~p" = (moveUp:, moveUp:, moveUp:, moveUp:, moveUp:, moveUp:, moveUp:, moveUp:);   "~n" = (moveDown:, moveDown:, moveDown:, moveDown:, moveDown:, moveDown:, moveDown:, moveDown:);   "~b" = (moveLeft:, moveLeft:, moveLeft:, moveLeft:, moveLeft:, moveLeft:, moveLeft:, moveLeft:);   "~f" = (moveRight:, moveRight:, moveRight:, moveRight:, moveRight:, moveRight:, moveRight:, moveRight:); } /code/pre    precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;   &lt;item&gt;     &lt;name&gt;custom&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;identifier&gt;custom&lt;/identifier&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::P, ModifierFlag::FN, KeyCode::CURSOR_UP, KeyCode::CURSOR_UP, KeyCode::CURSOR_UP, KeyCode::CURSOR_UP, KeyCode::CURSOR_UP, KeyCode::CURSOR_UP, KeyCode::CURSOR_UP, KeyCode::CURSOR_UP&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::N, ModifierFlag::FN, KeyCode::CURSOR_DOWN, KeyCode::CURSOR_DOWN, KeyCode::CURSOR_DOWN, KeyCode::CURSOR_DOWN, KeyCode::CURSOR_DOWN, KeyCode::CURSOR_DOWN, KeyCode::CURSOR_DOWN, KeyCode::CURSOR_DOWN&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::B, ModifierFlag::FN, KeyCode::CURSOR_LEFT, KeyCode::CURSOR_LEFT, KeyCode::CURSOR_LEFT, KeyCode::CURSOR_LEFT, KeyCode::CURSOR_LEFT, KeyCode::CURSOR_LEFT, KeyCode::CURSOR_LEFT, KeyCode::CURSOR_LEFT&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::F, ModifierFlag::FN, KeyCode::CURSOR_RIGHT, KeyCode::CURSOR_RIGHT, KeyCode::CURSOR_RIGHT, KeyCode::CURSOR_RIGHT, KeyCode::CURSOR_RIGHT, KeyCode::CURSOR_RIGHT, KeyCode::CURSOR_RIGHT, KeyCode::CURSOR_RIGHT&lt;/autogen&gt;   &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  DefaultKeyBinding.dict doesn't work in some applications like Chrome or Xcode and Karabiner has a (barely) noticeable delay.  <comment164732> Thank you for your answer. Sad that there is no way wich works in every program :/
