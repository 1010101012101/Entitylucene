Upgrading SSD on Macbook Pro Late 2013 <body> I'm thinking to upgrade the ssd of my macbook pro 15 inc which is late of 2013. I haven't opened up the mac until now. But, as far as I see, ssd of the mac seems different like sliver. I think to buy that one. Isn't it suitable for the mac? I'd like to now the difference whether there is.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/P33YR.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer248528> The MacBook Pro Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013 SSD is not as in the picture of your question. Have a look at MacBook Pro 15" Retina Display Late 2013 SSD Replacement, to see what the Storage device looks like and how to replace it.

Note that the SSD Upgrade Kit offered by MacSales.com is a reasonably priced and nice option to be able to continue using the original SSD once replaced.  <comment307951> is there any website to buy the device disk on which your post <comment307952> @itsnotmyrealname, I've already included the link in my answer.

MacSaes.com offers the drive by itself too. As to where else to purchase it, well... you could just Google it.
