migrating partition to a 2015 MacBook Pro <body> I'm a developer and through the years with my MacBook Pro early 2011 I installed and configured a lot of stuff to help me in my job.br I would like to buy a new MacBook pro but don't want to spend days/weeks installing everything again.br Since the Mac migration assistant won't copy everything, is there a way to duplicate the partition from my old mac to a new MacBook Pro (which can't be opened) ?   strongedit:/strong  by "can't be opened" I mean I can't take the hard drive and clone my current one with a third computer.  To my knownledge the migration assistant won't copy kernel modules for instance.  <answer199437> You can use Thunerbolt/FireWire to boot a Mac into Target-Mode to use it as a drive. Than you can clone it using disk utility, like you would clone a regular external drive. Next you'll (probably) need to reinstall OS X on the new MacBook Pro over that partition (so you have the latest OS X with all the drivers for the new device and whatnot), you can either do that by first creating a bootable USB (DiskMaker X is an easy solution for that) or by using Internet Recovery (boot the Mac while holding cmd+alt/option+R).  <answer199440> You have several options to clone the main volume of the MacBook Pro (early 2011) to the MacBook Pro 2015.  strongPrerequisites:/strong  ul liUpdate the MacBook Pro (early 2011) to the latest Yosemite version/li lia Thunderbolt cable/li lior an external hard drive/li liand/or a full OS X on a thumb drive/li lioptional a backup/imager app like Carbon Copy Cloner/li /ul  strongThunderbolt:/strong  ul liAttach the Thunderbolt cable to the Macs/li liBoot the MacBook Pro 2015 to Target Mode with kbdcmd/kbdkbdT/kbd/li liBoot the MacBook Pro 2011 to the main volume and use Carbon Copy Cloner to clone it to the (mounted) main volume of the MacBook Pro 2015.

Also have you looked at using Time Machine to restore the partition onto the new MBP? <comment240024> I edited my question
