How do I view a webcam image on OS X 10.11 <body> How do I view a webcam image on OS X 10.11. I have a webcam previously used on Windows and just want to use it as a camera.  <answer234871> If you just want to see what your webcam is showing:  codeOpen QuickTime Player --&gt; File --&gt; New Movie Recording/code  It will give the option to record what your webcam is seeing but you don't have to. It will show a video feed from your webcam.  As an alternative to QuickTime Player you can use VLC.  You'll have to download it from VLC's website.  Once installed:  codeOpen VLC --&gt; File --&gt; Open Capture Device --&gt; Tick Video --&gt; Choose your camera for the drop down list --&gt; Click Open/code  <comment287196> QuickTime only seemed to show the inbuilt Facetime Camera but I found a Red button with a pull-down when hovering over the image. VLC seemed to work OK. <comment287199> Glad you got it working
