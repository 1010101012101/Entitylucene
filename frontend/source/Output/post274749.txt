Problem viewing html content in Apple Mail <body> This is an intermittent issue, and not predictable, but it does happen every day. Some HTML email that I receive and read in Mail is legible and normal, and other times it will show as text only, or else text plus some code I can't decipher.  I might receive two emails from the same source and one will be legible and the other not.  And occasionally I'll get a message like this one, "We're sorry, your client does not support HTML."  It does support HTML, but not, apparently, consistently.    After reading about other users with similar issues, I restarted in safe mode, but noticed no difference.    For reference, I have a Mac mini (late 2014) OS X El Capitan 10.11.06  <comment345558> Can you provide examples of the emails/sources?
