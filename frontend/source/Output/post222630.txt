There's something clogging up my Startup Disk space, I can't find it even using Disk Inventory X <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hak8T.png" alt="Storrage"  For some reason there's something clogging up my Startup Disk space. I can't find it even using Disk Inventory X.  <answer222684> Do you know how to use Terminal ?  You could install this: https://github.com/wvangeit/duk by executing 'pip install duk' using the Terminal. Then execute 'sudo duk /', and it will show you the space usage on your disk.  <comment269811> To free up some space, I'd start with turning off MobileBackups.  See: [What Crap Is This: OS X's MobileBackups](https://classicyuppie.com/what-crap-is-this-os-xs-mobilebackups/) <comment269814> What does Disk Inventory X show for free space? 750.3 MB?  Have you tried one of the other disk space apps?  I personally find Disk Inventory X's display hard to interpret.
