IDERepositoryViewer damaged or missing resources causes Xcode 5 to crash. Why? <body> I recently updated my OS X 10.8.5 Mountain Lion from Xcode 4.6.3 to Xcode 5 using the App Store upgrade.    As I mentioned here https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19051461/does-embarcadero-rad-studio-firemonkey-work-with-xcode-5, every time I tried to start Xcode 5, it would crash before I clicked or did anything.  The console log told me that a crash log was created at myusersfolder/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/Xcode_2013-09-27-16245...  That log said that "The bundle \U201cIDERepositoryViewer\U201d couldn\U2019t be loaded because it is damaged or missing necessary resources.\".  So, I went to Xcode, Show Package Contents, and in Contents/Plugins, I found and renamed IDERepositoryViewer, by adding an "X" to the end of its name.  Now, Xcode 5 runs without problem.  I have not used the IDE Repository Viewer -- it appears to work with SVN, whereas I use git.  However, in the Xcode menu, the Source Control/Checkout window opens (although I have no servers defined),   Does anybody have any idea why a fresh Xcode install, on the very first run, would have a plugin that is missing resources, causing Xcode to crash?  (My related question on SO was about app development.  This question is why Apple's app, Xcode, does not run correctly for me, so it seemed more appropriate here).

That offending plug-in is NOT part of Xcode 5 at all. Like you, I had this happen after upgrading from Xcode 4 to Xcode 5. I did a clean install of Xcode 5 on another computer and it doesn't have that plug-in.
