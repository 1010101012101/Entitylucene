So which is faster, the 2008 Mac Pro Dual Quad-Core or the 2011 MacBook Pro Dual Core? <body> For some reason I woke up this morning wondering which of my two computers was the fastest and should I be changing which one I use as my main workhorse...  I ran the Geekbench 3 test but I'm none the wiser and I wondered if anyone could offer any insight.  I should first say that I was running the free version of GB so I could only check the 32 bit architecture and I think both my computers are 64 bit so perhaps the test was irrelevant without running the 64 bit test.  2008 Mac Pro Intel Xeon E5462 2 x 2.8ghz Quad-Core 10GB of RAM  Single Core Score = 1508br Multi Core Score = 9915  2011 MacBook Pro Intel Core i7 Dual Core 4GB of RAM  Single Core Score = 2361br Multi Core Score = 4799  So I guess that I can deduce from this that my desktop Mac Pro is better when running all its cores...?!  And my laptop when it's running just a single core...?!  As you can probably tell this is a bit above my head.  However, I would be very interested to hear peoples thoughts as to which was the more powerful of the two.  At the moment the Mac Pro is my day to day computer but I was thinking of swapping.  I work in music so deal with audio a lot and video occasionally.  <answer220517> For most day-to-day applications, your MacBook Pro will be faster, because most applications do not utilise all available cores.  In the case of audio/video applications, your Mac Pro will win out. Not only because of the additional number of cores available, but because of the additional RAM available.  Also, it's important to mention that benchmarking applications only look at certain aspects of the computer's environment, and real-life usage will vary. For example, if either of the devices has an ssd, then that wouldn't be reflected in the benchmark, but would have a positive impact on the real-world performance.  <comment266897> I marked the question as too broad, though other flags may be applicable too (e.g. opinionated). BTW you already answered you own question somehow by citing a synthetical test. <comment266899> Might be too broad, but I'd stick with the Mac Pro. I'd also, next time you're feeling 'rich' have a look for one of the 4,1 2010 models updated to full speed 2012 spec 12-core 3.46GHz. Geekbench 2404 / 27705 [32k @ 64-bit] [About 2 grand, UK prices - haven't looked back since I got mine to replace what you have now] Multi-threaded performance is most useful on an audio project using a lot of plugins, as they then thread very well. <comment266914> It is not possible to answer such a question without taking the use into account. That is why I think this question is to general in the aspect that it does not specify the use in more detail. <comment267088> Hi guys, thanks a lot for the info.  I can see now that it is quite a broad question but the info you've provided is helpful.  Tetsujin, thanks for heads up on the other computer.  I'm actually thinking about just buying a new iMac in the future.  Cheers! <comment267089> Thanks Wrossmck.  That's useful to know about the benchmark test.  Neither have an SSD but if I end up buying a new computer then it'll be something I look at. <comment267090> Whilst I think about it, I suppose I wasn't really asking which was fastest.  What I was trying to understand was what the Geekbench results really meant... but I can see that I have kind of answered my own question.
