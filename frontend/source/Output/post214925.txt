Error when installing El Capitan: disk does not use GUID partition scheme, and I am unable to convert <body> I am running Yosemite version 10.10.5. I have a second partition running Windows 10. My main partition, running OS X, is formatted as Mac OS Extended (Journaled). I try to follow the instructions in the error message, but the codeOption/code button is not available.   I do not know how to proceed, and would appreciate some help.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/D7c5K.png" alt="enter image description here"  Terminal output:  strongdiskutil cs list:/strong   codeNo CoreStorage logical volume groups found/code  strongsudo gpt -r show /dev/disk0:/strong   precodegpt show: error: bogus map gpt show: unable to open device '/dev/disk0': Undefined error: 0 /code/pre  strongsudo fdisk /dev/disk0:/strong  precodeDisk: /dev/disk0    geometry: 29185/255/63 [468862128 sectors] Signature: 0xAA55          Starting       Ending  #: id  cyl  hd sec -  cyl  hd sec [     start -       size] ------------------------------------------------------------------------  1: AF   25 127  15 - 1023 254  63 [    409640 -  400094952] HFS+          2: AB 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [ 400504592 -    1269536] Darwin Boot  *3: 07 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [ 401785650 -   67071375] HPFS/QNX/AUX  4: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused   /code/pre  strongsudo gdisk /dev/disk0:/strong  precodesudo: gdisk: command not found /code/pre  <answer214943> Considering the comments and the results of the different listings above, Yosemite probably was installed with a hack to enable a Windows MBR only install.  I assume it was the Yosemite MBR Patch 10.10 (14A389). The patch allows you to install Yosemite to a disk with a pure MBR partition table and not the default GUID partition table with a pMBR or hybrid MBR (if Windows is installed).  Depending on the efforts needed to save your data, you may either backup everything, reinstall first Yosemite (or El Capitan) from scratch after partitioning the main disk with a GUID partition table and migrate your data from the backup and then install Windows with Boot Camp Assistant strongor/strong create a GUID partition table with proper partition values manually after booting to Internet Recovery Mode. The latter will probably render Windows unbootable.  Since the first method is trivial I only describe the second one.  strongAdd a GUID partition table manually:/strong  strongemThis method will probably render Windows unbootable!/em/strong  strongPreparation:/strong    ul liBackup your data - especially any data on your Windows partition./li liDetach any external drive (especially your external Time Machine backup drive)./li liRestart to Internet Recovery Mode by pressing kbdalt/kbd kbdcmd/kbd kbdR/kbd at startup.br The prerequisites are the latest firmware update installed, either ethernet or WLAN (WPA/WPA2) and a router with DHCP activated.br On a 50 Mbps-line it takes about 4 min (presenting a small animated globe) to boot to a recovery netboot image which usually is loaded from an apple/akamai server.  I recommend ethernet because it's more reliable. If you are restricted to WIFI and the boot process fails, just restart your Mac until you succeed booting.  Alternatively you may start from a bootable installer thumb drive (Mavericks or Yosemite) or a thumb drive containing a full system (Mavericks or Yosemite)./li /ul  strongAdding GUID partition table and the already existing MBR partitions:/strong  ul liOpen Utilities - Terminal/li liEnter codediskutil list/code to get an overview/li liUnmount your main disk with codediskutil umountDisk /dev/disk0/code (assumimg disk0 is the disk identifier of your main disk)./li liAdd an GUID partition table with codegpt create /dev/disk0/code/li liAdd the EFI and the existent "MBR partitions":  The command basically looks like this:  precodegpt add -b StartBlock -i IndexNumber -s NumberOfBlocks -t Type device /code/pre  To add all your partitions enter with the data found in your emfdisk/em list:  precodegpt add -b 40 -i 1 -s 409600 -t C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B /dev/disk0 gpt add -b 409640 -i 2 -s 400094952 -t 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC /dev/disk0 diskutil umountDisk /dev/disk0 gpt add -b 400504592 -i 3 -s 1269536 -t 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC /dev/disk0 diskutil umountDisk /dev/disk0 gpt add -b 401785650 -i 4 -s 67071375 -t EBD0A0A2-B9E5-4433-87C0-68B6B72699C7 /dev/disk0 /code/pre  The size of the last partition (your Windows partition) is odd because usually it's a multiple of 8.

Convert function! Kd4hls  <comment259548> The disk already uses the GUID partition table, otherwise Yosemite wouldn't be booting. Or do you try to install to an Hackintosh? So don't follow the instructions! Or backup all volumes before "changing" it! <comment259569> No, I have an authentic Apple computer. The point is, I do not know what to change. If the disk is already partitioned correctly, why can't I update the OS? <comment259573> @klanomath Done <comment259575> That looks bad. Please also add `sudo fdisk /dev/disk0`. Consider downloading and installing [gdisk](http://sourceforge.net/projects/gptfdisk/). Try `sudo gdisk /dev/disk0` and then from within gdisk `p` and post the printed partition table if available. The Windows partition and the Mac partition are both bootable? Did you add a second Windows partition from within Windows? <comment259576> I had trouble installing bootcamp on my own, so a friend did it. He said it was complicated. I am not sure what he did. Some kind of workaround, I guess. Both partitions are bootable. <comment259578> You have to download and install *gdisk* because it's not part of the OS. It's a tool similar to gpt. <comment299472> Welcome to Ask Different!  Please refrain from adding comments in the Answer section, this is for answers to the questions.
