Alternative to Boom (volume booster) <body> I'm disappointed to see that http://www.globaldelight.com/ are discontinuing support for Boom1 and charging users to upgrade to Boom2. In fact their smallprint suggests they intend to charge for Boom3.  As a software developer, it would be against my conscience to charge multiple times for a simple utility that the operating system should have supplied.  So, I am looking for alternatives.  Is there any other way to increase the volume on a MacBook?  PS Is it just my imagination, or has the most recent OSX (El Capitan)  increased the maximum volume level? Since Boost stopped working, I haven't really noticed a problem watching movies.  <answer217157> ol liTry the open source VLC/li /ol  It can boost the audio by upto 200%. The equaliser let's you boost even further.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5c1Uq.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uzSSY.png" alt="enter image description here"  ol start="2" liYou can boost audio in iTunes too. Select the song and press codeCmd+I/code/li /ol  You can boost audio by another 100% and use equaliser too.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dtxgy.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer271878> Soundflower and Loopback both offer functionalities similar to what you had in Boom, and the ability to boost the volume, which is what you requested. https://rogueamoeba.com/freebies/soundflower/  <comment324113> The problem that I have found with going past the max is that sounds get more distorted the louder you go.  Is getting external speakers or bluetooth speakers/headset outside the realm of possibilities?
