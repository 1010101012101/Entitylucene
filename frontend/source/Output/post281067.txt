Where are iCloud notes stored locally when Mac is offline? <body> Does anyone know if and where iCloud caches notes locally on macOS?   I am trying to recover lost notes from a Time Machine backup, but I'm having trouble accessing them, as they were stored in the "iCloud" section of the Notes app and not the "On My Mac" section. So the notes I need would have been saved in iCloud.  However, I suspect that iCloud notes must also be regularly cached locally because the contents are accessible when a Mac is not connected to the internet. Anybody know where?  I have found this path, but it is emnot/em helping me find what I need: ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Notes/Data/Library/Notes  I'm currently running macOS 10.12 Sierra if that helps.  <answer281196> Notes local database is by default located at:     ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Notes/Data/Library/Notes   <comment353806> @wes said he knows about the location, but that it isn't helpful.
