Put app link into google spreadsheet <body> This is an Apple iOS question despite having google spreadsheet in the title.  First a lesson: On iOS I can start an app by using an special URL.  Specifically, I replace https with the name of the app and then the app still start rather then the browser passing the parameters on the URL to the app.  Even more specifically, it is not really the name of the app, it is a name that the app registers when it is installed.    The URL for my app looks like this: myapp://?fname=mickey&amp;lname=mouse  I would like to put that link in a google spreadsheet, then allow a user that is viewing that spreadsheet on their phone to click on the link and have the app start.  I can put that link in email and have them click on it from email, so I am not asking for something completely weird.
