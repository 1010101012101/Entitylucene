any way to remap keys for only one app? <body> I've seen the system wide tools (that all seem to just manipulate the default key bindings) that allow you to swap keys around, but has anyone found a way to swap keys for just one application? (no, the app in question doesn't offer it, and the author was a bit of a prick about it when I asked if they could enable an option to adjust them.)  I'm talking about real keys like home, end, page up, page down... not shortcuts.  <answer13179> If it's a menu item, you can create a custom shortcut in System PreferencesKeyboard ShortcutsApplication Shortcuts. It lets you (re)assign any menu commands to whatever keyboard shortcut you want, for a specific app only.  <answer13258> You can use Ukelele to make your own keyboard layout, and switch to it when you open the application.  <answer27164> Keyboard Maestro might be your thing. Make a new command group which only applies to the application in question, then for each key you want to remap, make a new command with a hotkey trigger set to the real key and an "Insert Text" action set to what you want the key to be.  The emonly/em shortcoming I've found so far is that it can't handle the in-built volume control keys on an Apple keyboard. It can detect them &amp; act upon the event, but it can't suppress the volume change. In fairness, nothing else can either. Most programs I tried can't even detect it. Keyboard Maestro is the king of the pile.  <answer278135> I've been using BetterTouchTool for years and am constantly amazed at its flexibility. Despite its name, it is capable of intercepting/altering keyboard events as well, plus allows you to limit key mappings to particular applications.  <comment13906> I think the question was about remapping keys for example kbdd/kbd would behave as kbde/kbd (if it were switched to a dvorak layout, not assigning shortcuts. <comment13907> is your question about redefining shortcuts for commands or "really" for keys as Nilloc understands your question? <comment13936> Nilloc is correct, this is about real keys.
