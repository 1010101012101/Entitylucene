OSX Terminal no longer save my commands in history <body> Here's my issue. Last week I realized that my OSX (10.11.13) Terminal strongno longer saves the command I execute in the history file(s)/strong.  To be more clear:   ol liI type the command codetest/code/li liOn the same terminal window, I press arrow up: it's ok, codetest/code is there/li liIf I close the terminal, reopen it and press arrow up: codetest/code is no longer there (so it jumps to a command I executed weeks ago)./li /ol  Here's what codeprintenv/code returns :   precodeNVM_RC_VERSION= rvm_bin_path=/Users/my-user/.rvm/bin TERM_PROGRAM=Apple_Terminal GEM_HOME=/Users/my-user/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.1.2 SHELL=/bin/bash TERM=xterm-256color IRBRC=/Users/my-user/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.1.2/.irbrc TMPDIR=/var/folders/4x/y0j5261j7j3142sx_82m6fxm0000gn/T/ Apple_PubSub_Socket_Render=/private/tmp/com.apple.launchd.JLKMtkE4S1/Render TERM_PROGRAM_VERSION=361.1 MY_RUBY_HOME=/Users/my-user/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.1.2 TERM_SESSION_ID=B48F774F-86DA-4AA1-BAB7-888DCBA65E5A NVM_DIR=/Users/my-user/.nvm USER=my-user _system_type=Darwin rvm_path=/Users/my-user/.rvm SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/private/tmp/com.apple.launchd.550eXpVGiK/Listeners __CF_USER_TEXT_ENCODING=0x1F5:0x0:0x1 rvm_prefix=/Users/my-user PATH=/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:/Applications/MAMP/Library/bin:/Applications/MAMP/bin/php/php5.5.3/bin:/Users/my-user/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.1.2/bin:/Users/my-user/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.1.2@global/bin:/Users/my-user/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.1.2/bin:/Applications/MAMP/bin/php/php5.3.6/bin:/usr/local/mysql/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/Users/my-user/.rvm/bin:/sdk/android/platform-tools:/sdk/android/tools NVM_NODEJS_ORG_MIRROR=https://nodejs.org/dist PWD=/Users/my-user LANG=fr_FR.UTF-8 _system_arch=x86_64 XPC_FLAGS=0x0 _system_version=10.11 XPC_SERVICE_NAME=0 rvm_version=1.25.15 (stable) SHLVL=1 HOME=/Users/my-user LOGNAME=my-user GEM_PATH=/Users/my-user/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.1.2:/Users/my-user/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.1.2@global NVM_IOJS_ORG_MIRROR=https://iojs.org/dist _system_name=OSX _=/usr/bin/printenv /code/pre  Any help?  <answer225336> Based on this question and answer the following should work:  ul liDisable ~/.profile and ~/.bash:profile by renaming it:  precodemv ~/.bash_profile ~/off.bash_profile mv ~/.profile ~/off.profile /code/pre/li liCreate a new file ~/.bash_logout with the content emshell_session_update/em  precodeecho "shell_session_update" &gt; ~/.bash_logout /code/pre/li liEnter codekillall Terminal/code/li liOpen Terminal and enable ~/.profile and ~/.bash_profile by renaming it:  precodemv ~/off.bash_profile ~/.bash_profile mv ~/off.profile ~/.profile /code/pre/li liEnter codekillall Terminal/code/li liOpen Terminal and check the behavior now.

I don't flag it as such though. Please try the *.bash_logout file method (with the content shell_session_update)* and disabling .profile/.bash_profile temporarily. <comment273420> Could you temporarily remove your `~/.bash_profile`, start a new login shell, check if you have the same problem, and report this in your OQ. <comment273421> I removed my .bash_profile, started a new terminal, it seems to work again. <comment273423> Well, I must admit I never enter `exit` before closing a terminal window... That means I should enter `exit` 50 times per day :/ <comment273424> @enguerranws It's a known bug of RVM. In non-RVM environments you don't need the .bash_logout file. Hmm you may create an alias e=exit? ;-) <comment314020> You are just awesome :) Saved my day thanks a lot!!
