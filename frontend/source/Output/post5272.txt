Make QuickTime player ignore mouse gestures and touches <body> I like my Magic Mouse, but I often touch it "incorrectly" while watching a movie in QuickTime Player, and QTP then moves the video position forward or backwards or makes a pause or ... . It can be annoying :-(  I'd like to make my QuickTime Player ignore mouse gestures and touches. Is it possible?  <answer5273> You can try strongBetterTouchTool/strong that will give you strongmuch/strong more control.  There is a setting that will allow you to add per-application rules:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3wAet.png" alt="better touch tool settings bettertouchtool"  <answer139341> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Oi78t.png" alt="BetterTouchTool"  As Loïc Wolff says BetterTouchTool is a way to disable this horizontal scrolling. I was searching about the same problem and found the solution in this program (BetterTouchTool)  <comment5392> when you touch it incorrectly, does it protest? <comment5393> @cala depends on the movie he's watching :-° <comment5504> I tried to add some gestures for QTPlayer and send random key or take "No Action". It didn't help :-( QTP still does execute its actions.
