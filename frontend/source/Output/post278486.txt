macOS's Column View doesn't scroll to show item's information <body> Previously, the column view would allow scrolling that would display an items file type, created date, modified date, last opened date, and tags (if any). This would happen when the window's height wasn't very tall and the preview column was enabled (you'd see the preview of the file type AND if the metadata didn't fit, that part of the screen was vertically scrollable).  Any thoughts on why this no longer works?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/W9xwS.png" alt="Image of the window. Note that I can&#39;t scroll vertically to display the objects metadata."  <comment350451> What version of macOS is running on this Mac? <comment350662> macOS Sierra - v 10.12.3.
