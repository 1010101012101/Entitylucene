OS X as X Window Server <body> Is it possible to serve Mac applications like iPhoto over a network to X Window clients?  hr  Our problem is that a broken Graphics card is causing a lot of stripes etc on the screen. Other remote solutions doesn't circumvent the problem.  This is a G5 PowerPC.  <answer74337> No, it isn't. iPhoto and nearly every application on OS X don't run under X11 environment. They have no idea about X11 and cannot be transmitted via X11. Besides, the server component of X-Window runs on the computer whose display is used. You are actually looking for a way to make iPhoto transmit its appearance to a different window server.
