Can't mount Macintosh HD volume - invalid content in journal <body> my 2TB external HHD has decided to fail to mount with the error "invalid content in journal" so i removed the journal using the terminal and tried to mount it - still fails  ran verify disk on the partition  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0EnVb.png" alt="enter image description here"  ran repair disk on the partition  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HQgeF.png" alt="enter image description here"  so what can i try next? if i need to reformat then i need to get the data off the HDD first. it did mount briefly during one of the verification attempts but now nothing seems to get it to mount.  <comment186087> Why did you remove the journal? I think you borked your filesystem. <comment186222> because that was one of the things to try and fix it.... it was broken before i removed the journal
