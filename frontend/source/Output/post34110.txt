Is there a Mac diagnostics utility for troubleshooting hardware issues? <body> Is there software that helps identify problems, issues, conflicts, etc. with the hardware of a Mac?  I came across Tech Tool Deluxe, which was apparently used in Applecare. Wondering if there was any other hardware diagnostics tool out there.  <answer34113> Looks like Apple Hardware Test is a possible solution. Might need some elbow grease to get it to work on OS X Lion.  <comment49722> I've got Apple Hardware Test running, but it finds no problems. Still the machine locks up *a lot* (with no logs left behind). Any other tools to recommend? <comment217491> [Does anyone know any good Diagnostic tools?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/125358/8546) (2014-03-24, closed)
