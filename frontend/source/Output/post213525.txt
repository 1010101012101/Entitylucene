How do I change the default sound for Reminders in El Capitan? <body> It is very important as I use it for medication reminders. I would like to use one of the sounds (.aif) that I already have stored on my computer. Changing default sounds in Calendar would be helpful to know as well. Thanks!  <answer213716> You were on the right lines, but the wrong location…  System sounds are in code/System/Library/Sounds//code it's only user sounds in code~/Library/Sounds/codebr Replace the Basso.aiff in there with your custom version [bearing in mind this will replace Basso in any other system alert that uses it too]    It will be the same for Calendar alerts - except there you can define which system sound to use, so if you did need a separate custom sound in there you could apply the same logic to one of the other system sounds in the Library folder.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3S1UL.png" alt="enter image description here"  Note that in El Capitan you would first have to disable System Integrity Protection before you can modify the Sounds folder…     ol   liReboot your Mac into Recovery Mode by restarting your computer and holding down kbdCommand/kbd+kbdR/kbd until the Apple logo appears on your screen./li   liClick Utilities  Terminal./li   liIn the Terminal window, type in codecsrutil disable/code and press kbdEnter/kbd./li   liRestart your Mac./li   /ol      Revert the same way using codecsrutil enable/code   <comment257781> I've always envied Windows for its ability to let you define whatever sounds you like for various actions. It is a shame OSX doesn't let you do this! <comment257786> http://www.cultofmac.com/219297/switch-out-the-awful-default-notification-center-sound-for-something-better-os-x-tips/ <comment257827> I've followed the steps at cultofmac previously, but tried again. My ~/Library/Sounds folder is empty. I  added a newly created aiff and named that sound of my choice as basso.aiff and placed it in the empty folder. Followed the terminal instructions. But, I get no alert sound at all from Reminders. Strangely, alert sounds (ie notification of deleting a song from iTunes, as well as certain alerts in other apps use that aiff too.) I could careless about what sound I hear in any app other than Reminders. Suggestions? Many thanks. <comment257999> Could you merge this comment into your question to clarify it for future Googlers.
