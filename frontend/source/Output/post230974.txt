ARD client stuck Offline or not? <body> After years of good networking followed by several ugly network failures and recoveries, my Task Server (ARD 3.5.4) started reporting a client (ARD 3.7.1) as emOffline/em, where it has been stuck. Kickstart, tried just once, failed due in part to lack of skill. A couple of other online solutions say to delete files from the bad client (plus cycling remote sharing). However, another client (ARD 3.4) when used as the Task Server finds that same bad client emAvailable/em, and controllable. This strongly suggests that the sticking problem, at least in this case, lies in the first Task Server, and that the allegedly bad client is innocent. Any ideas?  Perhaps a relevant fact is that the network failures caused automatic name changes on the three computer by adding numerical suffixes in parentheses. Now the computer names as reported by the original and temporary Task Servers disagree by the suffix. Is resetting the computer names on each computer a possible fix, or might it cause more ARD problems?   <comment281984> Try connecting to the affected computer by its IP address. <comment282122> ID: Thanks for the tip. It led me to discover that ARD is reporting neither the same set of IPs nor the same set of names for the four (3 above + 1 idle) computers on my network. This was all likely a consequence of a network instability caused by a faulty installation by my satellite TV provider. I'll have to figure out what is a best set, then figure out how to set them! Any hints on that task would be appreciated, too. <comment282215> Problem solved â€” sort of. Using ARD to find IPs uncovered Troublesome client  ARD  Preferences  Security, "Allow control of this computer when this application is running" not selected. Checking the box immediately made this client Available and controllable to the desktop Task Server. It also put that client Offline to the other client used as a temp Task Server. At the moment my ARD network is as desired with both clients controlled, but there is a hidden, incomplete configuration. <comment282218> The device name change glitch can have several causes: [One link](http://www.cnet.com/news/tackle-a-macs-name-changing-with-sequential-numbers/) here, [another link](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/153080/computer-name-keeps-changing-osx-10-10-14a389) here @ AskDifferent. <comment282797> ID: 3 levels of on-site tech support + engineering managed to eliminate 2 redundant, race-causing adapters someone had installed years back, & to switch USB power to 110v on a good adapter. This left a 4-Mac ARD network, each with its unique sets of computer names and IPs to debug. Two days after my last post, I shut down in exhaustion at 3am. Returning at ~9am, I found that the system had reconfigured itself! Only the Task server had two different IPs in the consensus of the Macs, which now seems harmless and permanent. Thanks for the links. I plan to read them.
