Emacs-like navigation shortcuts only sometimes triggered <body> I have an issue with the Emacs-like navigation of macOS (commands like ctrl-p, ctrl-n ...). The problem is that they get triggered only some of the times. For example if I press ctrl-b instead of moving the cursor one character backwards it adds the character b to the text. I haven't really found a pattern when the keyboard shortcut works and when not. It seems to happen randomly. I just reinstalled macOS (Siera 10.12.3) from scratch and the problem still persists. Has anybody else encountered this problem?
