File Not Found Error while including bits/stdc++.h <body> My System: MacOSX 10.9 64-bit  Hey guys, I am working on Sublime Text 3. I have included the code#include &lt;bits/stdc++.h&gt;/code but when I am compiling the source code,  precodeadityas-air% g++ 285C.cpp 285C.cpp:1:10: fatal error: 'bits/stdc++.h' file not found #include &lt;bits/stdc++.h&gt;          ^ 1 error generated. /code/pre  Is there some other header file specific to Mac that is needed to be included instead of this or some tweaking that is needed to be done to Sublime Text 3.Thanx in advance!  <answer148402> The file is distributed with GCC. You install GCC with Macports or Homebrew.     brew install gcc   <answer248418> Did this   precode{ "cmd": ["/usr/local/Cellar/gcc/6.1.0/bin/g++-6", "${file}", "-o", "${file_path}/${file_base_name}"], "file_regex": "^(..[^:]*):([0-9]+):?([0-9]+)?:? (.*)$", "working_dir": "${file_path}", "selector": "source.c",  "variants": [     {         "name": "Run",         "cmd": ["bash", "-c", "/usr/local/Cellar/gcc/6.1.0/bin/g++-6 '${file}' -o '${file_path}/${file_base_name}' &amp;&amp; '${file_path}/${file_base_name}'"]     } ] }  /code/pre  after doing codebrew install gcc/code and it's working. The g++-6 is the version of the compiler that gets installed, it may be different for different users. Thank you!  <answer270812> Since, bits/stdc++ is a GNU GCC extension, whereas OSX uses the clang compiler.  You have to create strongbits/strong directory inside strong/usr/local/include/strong and then make a header file strongstdc++.h/strong inside bits and paste the contents of this code inside it. Then, it should compile as expected.  <comment174815> I suppose I downloaded the developer tools for Xcode, after which I was able to compile C++ programs using g++ compiler. <comment174816> Xcode does not include gcc but llvm. You can compile C++ programs but you will not have gcc specific files. <comment174817> Ok, So I can still install GCC with Homebrew(say) and the issue will be resolved? <comment174818> Yes but before doing that: what are you doing? <comment174822> Actually I want this for competitive coding, including this header automatically includes all the required headers which otherwise are needed to be explicitly mentioned. Although I can have a template for that but just one header makes code look concise, just that!! <comment174827> If you want to distribute what you are doing you should either  include files that will be available or write a configure script to check for what is available <comment350225> apparently I had to comment out #55 "#include sdtdalign" as it wasn't available either..
