Apple rejected my app (twice), citing a very grey area violation but already have other similar apps on the Appstore. What can I do? <body> After a painful conversation with the reviewer I was asked to remove our biggest USP and resubmit, however there is already a very popular app that blatantly offer the very same feature.  I didn't bring this up with the reviewer on the call as she was very VERY aggressive and this could potentially have made matter worse. Which option do I have now?  <comment312324> Also http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/179820/does-it-make-any-sense-to-complain-about-app-store-app-review
