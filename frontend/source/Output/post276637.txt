can't install iCloud Drive on iPhone 7 <body> I just got an iPhone 7 from my job. Being more of an Android/Linux guy, I am actually very impressed by this device. One thing is very strange though: I can't find/acces the iCloud Drive app! When I ask Siri, it says that it isn't installed, and suggests that I install it. When I click the linked provided, there is the little icon with an cloud, but it is "toned out" in the colors, and nothing happens when I click it. I don't understand what I'm suppose to do about this.   The reason I need iCloud in the first place is to backup my phone (also "toned out" in the Settings → iCloud menu) and to use the "Just Press Record" app, which requires iCloud, and when I start the app it tells me I need to enable iCloud Drive first. Which I can't do.   Update: Under settings, there is an iCloud settings, which informs me that I have 5 GB storage and that Photos is using a little bit of it.  Under "Restrictions", it doesn't have anything registrered (which is the only possible cause provided by Just Press Records support FAQ.   I am logged into my apple account. When I log onto icloud.com, and select drive, I get this:  https://www.dropbox.com/s/w1jxbhpn5ebr8o4/icloudtroubles.png?dl=0  ...which tells me I should open the iCloud Drive app on my iOS device. So, back to square one, haha. Ever read the book Catch-22? Well, this is a Catch-22.  Thank you for your time, Emil  <answer296247> Typically, this is restricted via MDM profiles. To check, open the settings app and inspect your profiles.  ul liTap settings app/li liTap general/li liScroll content up if needed to see Profile (above Regulatory and below VPN)/li liTap in to each profile you have and inspect what it restricts./li /ul  If you have no profiles, I believe the profile entry is hidden so you might need to look for another answer if you don’t have a profile restricting this.  <comment348218> Do you see an entry for iCloud in the `Settings` app? <comment348221> Is the device managed centrally by your IT department? Are you logged in into iCloud/with your AppleID? <comment348227> Hi, have updated my question with answers to your question to my question. <comment348231> Under `Settings - iCloud` do you see an entry for iCloud Drive?  Have you followed all the steps in [Apple's support doc](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204025)? <comment348235> The iCloud Drive App is available in the App Store. Have you looked there specifically for the app? [This page](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204025) gives more info. <comment349457> I found out, it *is* because of the settings/restrictions because of my phone being also a work phone. bummer .Thanks for your helpful suggestions though. <comment374172> I don’t think so Emil. I’m having the same problem and my phone isn’t a work phonee. Have you found a sollution already? Please let me know ! Grt Kenzy <comment374211> Yes that was it! Our it support told me this but forgot to answer it myself here. Thank you :) <comment374212> Well for me at least that was actually the case, look at the accepted answer to check whether your phone company has put in some restrictions?
