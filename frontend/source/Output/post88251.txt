Transfer podcasts <body> I just switched from iMac to Macbook Pro and I wanted to transfer all my podcasts to it without downloading them all over again.  Copy/Pasting the podcasts folder won't list it in iTunes.   A found a cranky way to do it by subscribing to the podcasts again, partially download the episode (pause it after a while) and replacing/renaming the full one I have as download.mp4 where the podcast is being downloaded.  This is very cumbersome and I have loads of podcasts.  Is there any way to automate this or can this be accomplished in other ways?  <answer88252> Found the answer I was looking for here:  emiTunes: How to move your music to a new computer/em http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4527
