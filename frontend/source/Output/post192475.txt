time machine refuses to backup to time capsule <body> I'm trying to backup my hard drive to the time capsule, but it gives me the following error:  precodeTime Machine couldn’t complete the backup to “aaragon's Time Capsule”. The backup disk is not available. Make sure the backup disk is connected or select a different backup disk.  Latest successful backup: March 19, 2015 /code/pre  I don't know what to do as I've tried everything on this support page and on this one. I use dual backup so I have two disks (see picture). img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UMCMC.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment228951> It looks like it is out of space? <comment228966> How is 261 GB available "out of space"?? <comment228967> Isn't the time capsule supposed to delete old backups to make space for new ones?
