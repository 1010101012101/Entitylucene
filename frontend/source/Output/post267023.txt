iMovie (now on DVD) not playing back properly <body> I have a finished iMovie (made in the latest version of iMovie in the latest version of MacOS Sierra) that I exported to iTunes and then burned to a DVD.   As expected, the DVD plays back not only on my Mac but also on computers running Windows. The unfortunate part is that the DVD does not play back in my home DVD player... What did I miss? Why does it not playback?  strongNote:/strong The DVD player that I put it in, I expected to be a bit more "lenient" with playback because it is also a DVD burner.   I exported at 1080p onto a DVD-R. Also this is the latest version of iTunes.   This is a Memorex DVD and the DVD player will playback MPEG and MP3.  <comment334964> Can you post the settings you used to burn the DVD? <comment334965> @Volsk As far as? Do you want like definition and such? <comment334973> Sometimes the quality of the disc media itself determines its playability in a consumer DVD player. What brand of DVD-R are you using? I find [this page](http://www.digitalfaq.com/guides/media/dvd-formats.htm) invaluable for deep DVD information. <comment334975> Many DVD players, especially older ones, do not play video files unless they are encoded to Mpeg2. Check your player's manual to see what formats it supports. <comment334998> Please see question, I have made a - hopefully - helpful edit.
