How to list content of .Trashes folder in single-user mode <body> Is code.Trashes/code folder suppose to be empty when computer is launched in single-user mode. If not, how do I see its contents? I tried codels/code command, but it doesn't list anything. It could be that the Trash simply is empty, but due to an error I am working on, I cannot login into my user account to check it myself.  <answer236064> There is a systemwide Trash folder as well as one per user. If you deleted files in Finder while being logged in with your user account, the deleted files are in code/Users/YOUR-USER-NAME/.Trash/code.   <answer236066> The command I use while in normal mode is codesudo ls -a /.Trashes/code and in single-user mode you don't need to use codesudo/code.  On my system, code/.Trashes/code is empty however code~/.Trash/code is not empty as I have files in my Trash.  On external volumes code.Trashes/code in the root of the volume has directories, one for each code$EUID/code and within those directories are the files deleted, on each volume, by each User.
