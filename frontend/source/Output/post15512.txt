bootcamp with windows 7 64bit? <body> I have the new (2011) 27" iMac and need to run visual studio and some other .NET software development related software. What version of Windows 7 (home premium OEM - because it is the cheapest?) should I buy? 64bit or 32bit?  <answer15516> Check these:  ul lihttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT1846/li lihttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT4410/li lihttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT1461/li /ul  <answer15517> If you plan to use more than 4gb of memory go for 64bit. If you don't care 32bit will run as well.
