What are the empty home and net drives? <body> I have two drives on my Mac which are always empty (I've enabled show hidden files in the Finder):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cvOul.png" alt="enter image description here"  What are these drives for?  <answer9344> Not sure why you're emalways/em seeing them -- I don't, even with hidden files enabled -- but they're the root directories commonly used by the automounter when you connect your Mac to an NFS network (which generally means a Unix/Linux network). Users' home directories are usually mounted under /home, and other shared filesystems under /net.
