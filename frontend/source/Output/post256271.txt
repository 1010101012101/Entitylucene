mac book mid 2010 booting issues <body> I recently had a very peculiar problem with my macbook pro. Whenever I power down or restart the my macbook, I get a login screen, and after punching in username/password, I just see a screen with a progress bar which never gets finished - I waited for 8 hours.  strongWHAT I TRIED/strong  I have two partitions on my hard drive. One is marked as MAC and another is marked as DATA. I booted using the recovery mode (pressed cmd + R at the boot) and went to disk utilities.   I then erased my MAC partition completely. Again went to the main menu and selected 'Reinstall Mac OS'. Selected MAC partition as the install location and initiated the setup. Since then setup is stuck at screen - a progress bar showing installing mac sierra  (almost 5 hours now).   I have no idea what went wrong. It neither gives any error, nor it moves any further.   I am connected to a fast wifi.  <comment320102> Have you tried interrupting the startup by holding down the power button? Try doing that and then pressing the power button again to turn it on. What happens if you do that?
