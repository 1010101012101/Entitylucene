Stuttering Bluetooth connection to Trackpad since updating El Capitan to 10.11.4 <body> Every two hours or so of using the Trackpad (the old one), the cursor stutters so much to be unusable. This started right after I updated from 10.11.3 to 10.11.4, and so I'm inclined to suspect that that update caused it.  Have you managed to find a solution?  Running the pair "Turn bluetooth off" / "Turn bluetooth on" solves the problem on my MacBook Pro, but I'd like a more solid solution.  <comment292672> There's a new update to El Capitan, 10.11.5.  Try updating and see if that fixes the problem. <comment294071> After a week with 10.11.5 the problem is gone. It doesn't prove that 10.11.4 was the culprit, but either way, it's all good now.
