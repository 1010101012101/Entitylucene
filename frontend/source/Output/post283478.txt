Is the Bank address important in the Agreements, Tax, and Banking in iTunes Connect? <body> A little context: I'm applying for the Paid Apps contract and they require my ABA Routing number. When selecting a routing number there is an address associated with it.   Is the address important? Normally when using my banking information I only need the routing number. States nowadays have a single uniform routing number. What is the significance of a separate address, and which one do I select? I no longer live in the state that my routing number is associated with.  <comment357428> You can [request an account merge](https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/merging-accounts) to merge an unregistered account with your standard account.
