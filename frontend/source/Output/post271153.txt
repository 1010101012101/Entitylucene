My Bluetooth speakers occasionally cut off for a second, with warnings in the Bluetooth Explorer. How do I fix this? <body> I just replaced my wired headset with a pair of wireless headphones. They mostly work fine, except that occasionally, at random intervals, the sound will cut off for about a second or two. Most of the time that second of audio is lost. Rarely, the playing sound stops with it. Once, the music player I was using at the time (mpv) refused to play music (the current time would not advance even when unpaused), but the system sound effect beep worked fine.  I ran Apple's Bluetooth Explorer for the duration of about 2.5 albums of music, and when this happened, I noticed the following log entries:  precodeJan 31 13:20:39 Pietros-MacBook-Pro kernel[0]: **** [IOBluetoothHostControllerUSBTransport][InterruptReadHandler] -- Received kIOReturnNotResponding error - retrying: 1  Jan 31 13:20:39 Pietros-MacBook-Pro syslogd[42]: ASL Sender Statistics Jan 31 13:20:40 Pietros-MacBook-Pro kernel[0]: **** [IOBluetoothHostControllerUSBTransport][ClearFeatureInterruptEndpointHalt] -- successfully posting another read for the mInt0InterruptPipe -- mInterruptPipeInOutstandingIOCount = 1 -- this = 0x1800 /code/pre  There are lots of Google results for this message, but no solutions, and they all have to do with Bluetooth eminput devices/em, not emaudio devices/em.  These messages, or variants thereof, also shows up a lot:  precodeJan 31 13:44:48 Pietros-MacBook-Pro launchservicesd[76]: SecTaskLoadEntitlements failed error=22 Jan 31 13:44:48 --- last message repeated 3 times --- Jan 31 13:44:48 Pietros-MacBook-Pro appleeventsd[50]: SecTaskLoadEntitlements failed error=22 Jan 31 13:44:48 Pietros-MacBook-Pro WindowServer[178]: SecTaskLoadEntitlements failed error=22 Jan 31 13:44:48 Pietros-MacBook-Pro tccd[6849]: SecTaskLoadEntitlements failed error=22 Jan 31 13:44:48 Pietros-MacBook-Pro coreaudiod[162]: SecTaskLoadEntitlements failed error=22 /code/pre    precode2017-01-31 18:37:20 +0000 Mode change 13 for handle: 0x2 2017-01-31 18:37:46 +0000 Mode change 13 for handle: 0x0 2017-01-31 18:37:46 +0000 Mode change 13 for handle: 0x2 2017-01-31 18:40:09 +0000 Mode change 13 for handle: 0x0 /code/pre  I'm not sure if these are related or not. The full log from this session is available here.  So what's going on and how do I fix it?
