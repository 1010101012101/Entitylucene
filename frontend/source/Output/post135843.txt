Access tabs directly in Safari with ⌘+1..9 keyboard shortcuts? <body> Can you access tabs directly in Safari using the ⌘+1..9 shortcuts like Chrome?  <answer135844> Edit: This answer pre-dates Safari 9.0 where Apple correct the Cmd-# behaviour.  You can, but it takes an extension to be able to do it.  You'll need to install Safari Tab Switching by Olivier Poitrey to be able to use ⌘+1..9 to access tabs directly. It's a great extension if, like me, you've got these shortcuts in muscle memory from working with Google Chrome for so many years now. It's also open source and available on GitHub for the curious.  <answer209039> This is now the default behavior of Safari 9.  <comment252114> +1 for a correct answer, but why 'sadly'? I like it, and there's a toggle for it in Preferences for those who don't. <comment252118> @grgarside I removed the word "sadly" since it does not contribute to a correct answer. But I prefer the prior behavior greatly, thus my use of the word "sadly". <comment252131> This makes me sooooooooo happy. Safari is screaming fast and now it behaves properly. :)
