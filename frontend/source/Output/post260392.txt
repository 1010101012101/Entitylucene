OS X Server cron job timeout <body> my first time asking a question on StackExchange.  I have a cron job that runs every night at 3 AM.  The cron job might take upwards of 30 minutes to complete.  I have noticed that they are regularly not finished running before they are terminated.  Is there a time limit on OS X cron jobs?  And is there a way I can extend this?  Much appreciate all answers and suggestions.  <comment326009> When `cron` runs, it sends mail message to the account that runs the job.  Type `mail -u USERNAME` to see what the messages are.  If it's run as root, use `sudo mail`
