How to navigate lock screen using keyboard? <body> On the lock screen, I need to use mouse to select the user to login. I would like to navigate using the keyboard.  I tried Tab key, and combination with Ctrl and Option key, but can't find a way to navigate using keyboard.  Any ideas?   <answer290626> Use the left or right arrow key to highlight your chosen user, then press Enter to select.  <comment366898> You can also start typing the name of the user and it will be highlighted.
