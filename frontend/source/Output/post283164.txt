Can I increase my VNC bitrate for smoother remote experience? <body> I have several Mac computers on a LAN with Gigabit connections amongst each other. Whenever I connect through Screen Sharing (built in), I can only max out at ~25 MB/s, even though I can reach ~80 MB/s with file transfers on the network.   Is this a limit of VNC? I'm looking for a better quality remote connections with the ability to smoothly playback video from machines on the network.   Is there a better software for this perhaps?
