Disappearing Favorites in dialogue boxes <body> I am running OSX 10.11.6 and I am finding that for some time in a few of my applications (most notably Airmail 3 and Apple Photos) that when I use the file selector dialogue (which is obviously akin to Finder) my shortcuts are completely missing. All I can use is the icon for my computer itself and then clumsily dig around until I can get to the directory which contains my file. It's absurd. Also, even if I try to put aliases back into the sidebar of the dialogue box in hopes that at least next time I will have those there (which would be better than nothing) they appear to be getting deleted so I am permanently stuck with a broken side pane for the dialogue box for this app!  I have to major questions: 1) Why would the shortcuts which appear in the left pane suddenly disappear like that for certain applications? What controls what goes into that side pane for a given app? 2) Why would different applications have different items what appear in the left pane of the dialogue box? I would have assumed that those shortcuts are the same that appear in the left pane in Finder, but that is clearly not that case. The are similar but I suspect they are copies of what is in finder.  What is also strange is that for the most part the rest of my apps the file selector dialogue works fine and looks very much like the Finder. I would ordinarily blame the App in question, but the fact that it happens in at least two Apps, one of them Apple Photos, I am thinking it's a larger problem.  Final question: Is there a way to "scrub" the dialogue settings for an app so that I can start "fresh" instead of mucking about with this obviously corrupt left pane?  Thanks!
