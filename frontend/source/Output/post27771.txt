How do I restore my lost Address Book entries on my iPhone? <body> My mom just got a new iPhone 4S today, so she wanted me to transfer the contacts on her old iPhone 3G to the 4S. However, I screwed up.  And I don't have a single backup, so now, all I have is a copy of the contacts on her computer, and no real contacts.  Do any of you know how to fix this? Restore the old data?  <answer27994> Check if she's stored the contacts anywhere else, such as in Hotmail, Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail, etc.  You can pull them into the phone by linking an account in strongSettings/strong, strongMail, Contacts, Calendars/strong, strongAdd Account.../strong, or you can synchronize with the PC by going through the iPhone options in iTunes.  Otherwise, start typing...  <comment31832> What kind of computer does she have, Mac or PC? What are the contacts stored in (e.g., Microsoft Outlook, Mail, Mozilla Thunderbird, etc.)? <comment31840> Was the iPhone synced with the computer at all? <comment31969> It was the first time I installed iTunes on her computer after a restore, so I had no previous backups.  All the old contacts are lost. <comment32099> Sorry to say: Zero backups equal zero restoration opportunities. <comment134423> What does this statement mean?  "all I have is a copy of the contacts on her computer" If you have a copy then you have the contacts. <comment179618> You should change the question: "How can I restore my contacts I do not have?"
