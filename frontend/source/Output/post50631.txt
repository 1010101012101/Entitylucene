Grab list of Stats, Application Data, and Serials off OSX 10.6 to prepare for reformat and fresh install? <body> I need to reformat my 2007 OSX as it is now returning kernal errors. I want to install everything fresh but I have a lot of software and don't want to sit here making a list of everything installed as it is all unorganized.  For windows I usually accomplish this with Belarc Advisor: http://download.cnet.com/Belarc-Advisor/3000-2094_4-10007277.html?tag=mncol;1  Is there something similar, whether a method or an app that will allow me to do this on a mac?  <answer50638> Most of what you need (i.e. hardware, network information, software etc. thats similar to what Belarc Advisor returns) can be obtained using the built-in strongSystem Profiler/strong application (code/Applications/Utilities/System Profiler.app/code).   You can then export the information to a file using File âž” Save As.., then select either "Plain Text" or "Rich Text Format" from the "File Format" dropdown.  The above can get quite verbose, so if you just want a quick snapshot of installed apps (including those installed by default, of course), you could start the Terminal (code/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app/code) then type  codels /Applications/code   or   codels /Applications &gt; ~/Documents/apps.txt/code to send the output to the file codeapps.txt/code in your Documents folder.
