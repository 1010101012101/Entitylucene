Menu bar missing on second screen after El Capitan update 10.11.5 <body> I was on El Capitan 10.11.4 and just updated to 10.11.5.  Now the menu bar is missing on my second screen which is an enormous pain in the apple.  I have tried:  ul liSearching Google and AskDifferent and wading through many answers for much older OSX versions that no longer are relavent/li liRebooting/li liConfirming that it's not just my display setup hiding the menu bar above the visible area/li liMoving different apps into the second screen/li liTurning off and on the System Preferences  General  Automatically hide and show the menu bar setting/li liTurning on mirroring and then turning it off/li liKilling and relaunching Finder/li liPetitioning the ghost of Steve Jobs for help/li /ul  <answer238992> You only get a menu bar on anything other than your primary monitor if you havebr System Prefs  Mission Control  Displays have separate Spaces checked.  It's not a setting to idly switch on &amp; off if you have a very specific setup because it can seriously mess up your workflow... I did it once before to test a feature for SE, took me days to get my 12 spaces back together :(  <comment293190> gah -- upgrade must have unchecked that magically :( <comment293191> Glad that got it - I'll edit my answer to remove the assumption.
