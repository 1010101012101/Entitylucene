Macbook Pro EFI Edit <body> I have Linux installed on a Macbook Pro 5.1 (2009).  The Linux kernel starts up with the Performance CPU Governor, which causes the CPU to get hot.  Linux will drive the CPU at 3.06 GHz, but Apple publishes this CPU at 2.6GHz...hence the heat.  I want to edit the Max CPU Frequency in the Mac EFI so Linux will never run above the Apple published CPU frequency.  I recently ran BootRepair on this computer, and found an entry that I believe will allow me to enter the EFI settings.  This is from my codegrub.cfg/code file *actually, one of the codegrub.d/code files used to create codegrub.cfg/code):  precodemenuentry "MacOS UEFI Firmware.scap" { search --fs-uuid --no-floppy --set=root 640B-0804 chainloader (${root})/EFI/APPLE/EXTENSIONS/Firmware.scap } /code/pre  If I boot into the codeMacOS UEFI Firmware.scap/code menu entry from Grub, will I be able to edit the Max CPU frequency?  Any warnings?
