Safari 8.0 Full Screen Shortcut Not Working <body> After updating to OS X Yosemite (Public Release), Safari and several other applications stopped recognising kbd⌃/kbd+kbd⌘/kbd+kbdF/kbd as the shortcut to enter Full Screen. I can use kbdShift/kbd+kbdCommand/kbd+kbdF/kbd to enter Full Screen in Chrome, but not in Safari.  The shortcut worked when I was using OS X Yosemite Beta and Yosemite Beta 2. How to fix this problem?  <answer153871> I do not know about Yosemite, but on my Mavericks it is the  kbdctrl/kbd kbdcmd/kbd kbdF/kbd  The cmd-shif-F brings the search window.
