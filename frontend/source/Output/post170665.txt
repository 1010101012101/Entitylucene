Create a local MS SQL Database on OSX Yosemite <body> I need to do some tests on a MS SQL (not MySQL) database. But without the burden of having to open a hosting account, create a remote database, connect to it, and remotely insert a million records.  I need to create a MS SQL Database emlocally/em on my computer only to be used on my computer - and I need to be able to import it using Navicat software.  How can we create a emlocal/em MS SQL database on OS X [Yosemite]?  <comment200725> Parallels, VMWare Fusion or Virtual Box + Windows + MSSQL Server <comment200728> MS SQL server only runs on Windows and so you need a VM or run in Bootcamp <comment200751> @sdmeyers: That should be under Your Answer, not a comment.
