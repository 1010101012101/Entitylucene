How to create a custom command for the terminal? <body> Every time I make a new webpage, I do the following commands in the terminal.  precodetouch index.html mkdir stylesheets mkdir javascripts mkdir images mkdir sass open index.html -a sublime\ text /code/pre  I wish to automate this. like I wish I could type   precodeinit newProject /code/pre  and all the above commands would execute on its own.  Is it possible?  <answer271731> You can do it with various methods, here's the easiest one in my opinion:  Paste this line in your code~/.bash_profile/code  precodefunction initProject { touch index.html &amp;&amp; mkdir stylesheets &amp;&amp; mkdir javascripts &amp;&amp; mkdir images &amp;&amp; mkdir sass &amp;&amp; open index.html -a sublime\ text; }; /code/pre  Save it and execute codesource ~/.bash_profile/code  Right now you can type codeinitProject/code to get what you want.
