My MacBook Pro upgrade OS X to macOS Sierra 2 times <body> Yesterday I upgraded OS X on my MacBook Pro (2015 early 8g 256g) to macOS Sierra, and Xcode (7.3.1) to Xcode (8.2.1).  strongAttention/strong when upgrade the OS version, my macbook pro restart several times.  But today when I open my Xcode, it says:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qELRk.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongTranslate/strong     "Xcode" is updatingbr   "Xcode" is updating, can not open it.   But my Xcode is not usable, and App Store showed I should upgrade the OS version, as if 10.12.2 to 10.12.2. So I upgraded my OS X second time, and my MacBook Pro restarted several times too.  I have some questions:  ol liAre there any issues with my MacBook Pro?/li liWhen upgrading system version, my Pro restarted several times, is it normal?/li /ol  <comment337714> Most of us probably can't read that error message - would you like to translate it? <comment337715> @Tetsujin, i have translated it.
