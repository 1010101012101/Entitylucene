How to safely rid a Macbook Pro's power port of chocolate? <body> There was a chocolate coin from Christmas at the bottom of my laptop bag which managed to get shoved into the power port and conform to the space and fill it completely. I managed to scrape most of it away with tweezers but I'm afraid attempting to charge it will most definitely cause the residue to melt and harm the computer. Ideas?  <answer233741> If it's a magsafe port us a cotton swab or soft bristle tooth brush.
