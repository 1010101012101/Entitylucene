How do I encode mp4 files with H.264 (or x264) codec in AVIDemux? <body> I am trying to get AVIDemux set up with the X264 codec using this tutorial. The following is what goes down when I get to the code./configure --enable-mp4-output/code command  precodeThomas-Phillipss-MacBook:x264 tomdabomb2u$ sudo ./configure --enable-mp4-output Password: Unknown option --enable-mp4-output, ignored Found no assembler Minimum version is yasm-0.6.2 If you really want to compile without asm, configure with --disable-asm. /code/pre  So I tried it.   precodeThomas-Phillipss-MacBook:x264 tomdabomb2u$ sudo ./configure --enable-mp4-output --disable-asm Unknown option --enable-mp4-output, ignored Warning: gpac is too old, update to 2007-06-21 UTC or later Platform:   X86_64 System:     MACOSX asm:        no avs:        no lavf:       no ffms:       no gpac:       no pthread:    yes filters:    crop select_every debug:      no gprof:      no PIC:        no shared:     no visualize:  no bit depth:  8  You can run 'make' or 'make fprofiled' now. /code/pre  I issued codemake/code, and then codeThomas-Phillipss-MacBook:x264 tomdabomb2u$ ./x264 -v -q 20 -o foreman.mp4 foreman_part_qcif.yuv 176x144/code. And as expected, the results are:   precodex264 [error]: not compiled with MP4 output support /code/pre  So I'm stuck. Any ideas?  <answer1128> That's a pretty old tutorial. Try this one (linked from the official Avidemux site).  <answer214556> Fast solution:  ol liIf you have x264, don't worry about un-install. Stay with it./li liCheck your assembler yasm verison.  /li liInstall gpac -- from svn.code.sf.net and compile it. /li liCopy gpac/inlucde/gapc/ into x264/li liinside x264 and configure as follow  precode./configure --extra-ldflags=-L/home/../gpac/bin/gcc --enable-mp4 --enable-shared --enable-debug --enable-PIC  /code/pre/li liYou get the list in the configure x264 and you can easily find that your MP4 from 'no' changed to 'gpac'/li liEnter codemake/code /li liEnter codemake install/code/li liWrite x264 command as codex264 big_buck_bunny.y4m -o big_buck_bunny.mp4/code to test it. Now you have mp4 video. In this process it's not necessary to convert raw video to h264 and then in a second step with another tool to mp4. /li /ol  <comment7394> The tutorial you've linked to doesn't mention this issue - are you expecting it to fix something specifically or is it just a guess?
