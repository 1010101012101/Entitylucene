Transfer contacts that are still on my phone from old (deleted) Exchange account <body> I (stupidly) saved all my contacts to my Exchange account while employed at my previous job. Now I'm retired and that Exchange account is gone. However, the accounts that was synced to my phone before account deletion is still on my phone! How can I transfer them to my iCloud account or even better, my Gmail account?
