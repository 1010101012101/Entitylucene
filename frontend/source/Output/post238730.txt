Multiple Text Cursor <body> I recieved new mbp with el capitan  when i type on my macbooks retina display i see multiple phantom cursors  when I type in any application, mostly those with a white background the cursor persists. if i move using the arrow keys, the text rerenders removing the extra cursors.    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/McbLU.png" alt="phantom text cursor"  what is interesting about this issue, is that if I move the application to one of my dell monitors, i do not see the additional cursors but this laptop is fairly new and the display is otherwise fine so it is unclear whether this is software are hardware related.   ul liI am not using any bluetooth devices./li liI have also tried a PRAM reset./li liAn upgrade to latest el capitan did not correct the issue/li lisometimes linebreaks cause the cursors to appear, sometimes going back in the text with the arrow keys does as well/li lisometimes using the arrow keys causes the phantom cursors to intermittently disappear/li lithe issue occurs on my macs retina display but not on a lower quality dell monitor/li /ul  i have checked system preferences but nothing stands out  <comment292828> Does this occur both with the Dell monitor attached and detached? <comment292829> @agentroadkill yes
