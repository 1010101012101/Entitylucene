Screen doesn't work properly - iPhone SE <body> I have an iPhone SE in almost perfect conditions (I never dropped it). I bought it 9 months ago, but since 3 weeks (and maybe more) the touch screen don't always works, I mean that when I touch, sometimes it doesn't understand that I'm touching, and that's very very annoying. The problem happened at least 1 time per hours and I already tried to clean the screen and restart my iPhone, do you have any ideas?  <answer281683> If you have a screen protector or case on your phone, try removing them as that may be your issue.  Otherwise, it's most likely a hardware issue. Head to getsupport.apple.com to get help from Apple or visit a nearby Apple store.  <comment354343> Do you have a screen protector on the phone? <comment354390> Nope  @owlswipe I have no screen protector <comment354418> Well, sounds like a hardware issue! You'll need support from Apple for this one, head to [getsupport.apple.com](https://getsupport.apple.com) or bring your phone in to the Apple Store. <comment354443> Can't guarantee it, but my guess is they won't charge you for whatever necessary fixâ€“so long as you can reproduce the issue for them. I would just try!
