Search LaTeX documentation with Alfred <body> I'm using Alfred v2 on Mavericks. I would like to use it to quickly locate documentation of LaTeX packages (PDF files). I have TeXLive 2014 installed in code/usr/local/texlive/2014/code. I added code/usr/local/texlive/2014/texmf-dist/doc/latex/code to Alfred's search scope, but I'm not having any success. I tried searching using codeopen/code and the backtick (file search) to no avail. I tried rebuilding the OSX metadata, but not joy there either. The codelocate/code command-line utility quickly finds the files in question, e.g.:  precode$ locate thmtools.pdf /usr/local/texlive/2014/texmf-dist/doc/latex/thmtools/thmtools.pdf /code/pre  I should add that Spotlight can't find the files either. Is it a matter of permissions?  precode$ ll /usr/local/texlive/ total 0 drwxr-xr-x  20 root  wheel   680B Sep 21 11:51 2014 /code/pre  Thanks for any hint!  <answer167360> If you're a Powerpack user, I'd suggest creating a file filter. Follow the steps in the tutorial below, but drag in a LaTeX file instead to tell your filter which file types to include. You can include as many file types as you need.  http://blog.alfredapp.com/2014/04/24/tutorial-creating-an-alfred-workflow-without-a-single-line-of-code/  If you're not a Powerpack user, you can add the LaTeX file types to Alfred's Default Results. Go to the Preferences  Features  Default Results, click on "Advanced" and drag in your file types. However, be aware that this could clutter up your results quite a bit if you have a lot of files of this type, making it harder to locate your apps or essential files. :)  <answer167388> (1) Ready Alfred to accept a terminal command. Per this support document, the standard method is to type code&gt;/code and then the terminal command. Similarly, in LaunchBar the action is built into the basic index, too, and one can initiate it with codeterm/code or similar.  (2) Type codetexdoc PackageName/code where PackageName is the LaTeX package you're looking for the documentation for. For example: codetexdoc enumitem/code or codetexdoc thmtools/code.  It'll open the documentation PDF. That's it!  Note that of course you can also do this from the command line directly if you open a terminal window.
