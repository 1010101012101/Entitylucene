Adjusting Photos Burst Grouping after iOS sync <body> Photos for Mac does not properly interpret pictures groupings synced from iOS to Mac.  For example,   Let's say I take a burst of 100 photos. Of that group, I select 10 that I want to keep.   Now when I sync from iOS to Mac and view in Photos app, Photos will consider those 10 photos to be an unsorted 'Burst'.   This has left me with thousands of 'bursts' to manually go through.   Q: strongIs there a way to 'unburst' photos on Mac Photos App so they are not grouped?/strong   I emcould/em manually go through each burst and select each photo and save, but this process is extremely tedious as there do not seem to be any keyboard shortcuts available to quickly do this.   Has anyone else run into a similar issue? How are you handling this?
