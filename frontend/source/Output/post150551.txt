Why does my Finder window close when I eject an external drive? <body> Why does Finder window close when I eject an external drive sometimes?  It's still in the menu system, but no open window to toggle to.  I was not in any folder on said external drive, but in the codeDocuments/code folder - I am not even in a folder on the external drive being ejected..  I don't want it to close  Please advise.  <answer236682> Before ejecting drive click on any other drive and then press eject, window stays open,
