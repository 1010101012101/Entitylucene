iTunes 12.3 doesn't recognize iPad 1 with iOS 5 <body> I've upgraded my MacBook to El Capitan and my iTunes 12.3 doesn't recognize my iPad 1 with iOS 5 nor my iPhone 4s with iOS 9.1 any more.  I thought it was because my iPad 1 is too old and can't upgrade beyond iOS 5.1 but my iPhone 4 has the newer iOS 9.1.  So, any advice?  <answer219934> Try using a different usb port and a different cable.  Failing that, go to settings and reset  Jo  <comment265994> What does "reset Jo" mean?
