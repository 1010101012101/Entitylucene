iPhone 6 iOS 11 Public Beta: Camera format <body> I've installed iOS 11 Public Beta on my iPhone 6 but it seems that I can't select the new strongHEIF/strong format in codeSettings -&gt; Camera/code.   How can I check if I'm taking picture in codeJPG/code or codeHEIF/code? Or is it an iPhone 7 and above exclusive feature?   <answer288761> Hardware strongencode/strong for HEIF requires an strongA10/strong chip, and thus is only supported on iPhone 7 and newer. This is why you donâ€™t see the option to save as HEIF on your iPhone 6:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZqsFH.png" alt="HEIF Image Encode Support"  Hardware strongdecode/strong support starts with iPhone 6s and iPhone SE:     For iOS, we have hardware decode on the minimum config of the A9 chip.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/S7pCY.png" alt="HEIF Image Decode Support"  Introducing HEIF and HEVC - WWDC 2017  However since all Apple devices will support at least strongsoftware decode/strong, you will be able to share HEIF images natively (by iMessage, or any other sharing service that negotiates decode capabilities) with all Apple devices.
