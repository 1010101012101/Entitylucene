Is there a way to capture text messages into an image? <body> On the iPhone, if you hold down the Power button + Main button, it'll take an image of what's on the screen.  I've used it in the past to capture and print out text message exchanges.    Is there a way to do this if the text message exchanges span multiple pages?  <answer15243> Only by scrolling and capturing repeatedly and then assembling in a graphics program. Nothing built into iOS currently does it, and SMS data is completely inaccessible to App Store 3rd party apps (protecting your privacy).  <answer15272> Try PhoneView. It can convert your SMS logs to PDF files for viewing or printing.  <comment16506> Do you happen to have/use software that lets you back up your SMSes? <comment16680> So which one you actually mean? "How can I capture the whole screen down the scrollbar to the bottom to an image" or "How can I save my SMS text messages"?
