Unable to open file in Preview even though I have all permissions <body> I've been storing image files on Dropbox (uploaded automatically from my phone via their "Camera Uploads" feature). I just discovered that I don't have permission to open them from my synced Dropbox folder on my computer. The error is a dialog box reading:  precodeThe file “20160622_165411.jpg” couldn’t be opened because you don’t have permission to view it. To view or change permissions, select the item in the Finder and choose File &gt; Get Info. /code/pre  In Console, I see:  precode2017-02-06 08:12:33.317 Preview[15288]: PVImageContainer initWithURL:file:///Users/zipslime/Dropbox/20160622_165411.jpg failed, error = Error Domain=NSCocoaErrorDomain Code=257 "The file “20160622_165411.jpg” couldn’t be opened because you don’t have permission to view it."

I can open the files in Firefox, and even with Finder's Quick Look. What's going on with Preview, and how can I fix this?  hr  Solutions I've tried:  ul liCheck Get Info (already shows the right permissions; see below)/li licodechmod 744/code and codechmod 777/code/li liMove the files out of the Dropbox folder/li liDownloading a fresh copy of the file via the Dropbox web client strongdoes/strong work, but is not a reasonable solution at scale. /li /ul  From Get Info:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/O4ccN.png" alt="enter image description here"  From Terminal:  precode&gt; ls -l 20160622_165411.jpg  -rw-r--r--@ 1 zipslime  staff   3.0M Jun 24  2016 20160622_165411.jpg  &gt; whoami zipslime  &gt; chmod 777 20160622_165411.jpg  &gt; ls -l 20160622_165411.jpg  -rwxrwxrwx@ 1 zipslime  staff   3.0M Jun 24  2016 20160622_165411.jpg*  &gt; open 20160622_165411.jpg  # still fails /code/pre  I found an unusual attribute (the content was a bunch of inscrutable hex characters), but deleting it doesn't change things either.   precode&gt; ls -lO@ 20160622_165411.jpg  -rwxrwxrwx@ 1 zipslime  staff  -  3.0M Jun 24  2016 20160622_165411.jpg*    com.dropbox.attributes    83B &gt; xattr -d com.dropbox.attributes 20160622_165411.jpg  &gt; open 20160622_165411.jpg  # still fails /code/pre  <answer272014> This solution on the dropbox website solved my problem. However, I'm still perplexed! Where was the secret permission that wasn't visible from Get Info, codels/code, or codexattr/code? Alternate answers with explanation would be welcome.      ol   liClick on the Dropbox icon in your menu bar and then click on the gear in the Notifications panel./li   liSelect 'Preferences' then click on the 'Account' tab./li   liHold down the 'Option' key, and the "unlink this dropbox" button will change to "Fix Permissions". Click the button while continuing to hold down Option./li   /ol   <comment341807> Have you contacted Dropbox support? <comment341818> Thanks for suggesting that. I'll try it, though I'm still interested in the question of how it's even possible for Preview to be unable to open a file with these permissions. <comment341819> Are the files at the root level of your Dropbox folder, stored in the default Camera Uploads folder, or in another folder altogether? <comment341866> It occurs for most or all files in Camera Uploads. It's also occurring for some images in the Dropbox root, but other files in that folder are unaffected.
