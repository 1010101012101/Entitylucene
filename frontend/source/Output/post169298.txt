iMovie 09, setting all clips to 'fit' mode <body> I'm currently making an experiment that requires taking loads of pictures and then putting them into a video for analysis. However when I import them to iMovie 09, it gives the Ken Burns effect, which I don't like. I have to have the pictures in the 'fit' mode when cropping. I can change this feature manually for each picture but this takes a lot of time.  Is there a way in which I can set all the images to have the 'fit' mode? I appreciate your help.  <answer169469> I use iMovie version 10 but it this feature should be compatible. Drag them all to the Timeline. Press CTL+A to select them all or shift+select to select the ones you want. Then click on the crop button Press fit that's it
