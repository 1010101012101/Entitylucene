Photostream photos duplicate imported photos <body> I am getting duplicate photos in my MACOS Photos. I take many photos with my iPhone. Periodically I use Photos to import them onto my Mac for safe storage. Lately I've been deleting them off my phone at the same time.   Many if not all of the photos that I see imported have a duplicate. I believe that duplicate is the Photo stream copy which is still in the stream. This is very annoying. How do I avoid it?
