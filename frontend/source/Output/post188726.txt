In Safari, there is a lag for the Open Location and New Tab shortcuts. <body> I started noticing this about a month ago that when I hit CMD+L or CMD+T, there is about a second or so lag to when it actually does something.   I verified it's not a memory problem, as it happens after a restart. Internet searches didn't come up with anything.  I'm using OS X 10.10.3 and Safari 8.0.6.   <answer188731> This is a test, not a fix.  Open Terminal and type "nettop"  Scroll down (with arrow keys) till you see Safari.  Now scale the Safari and Terminal window side by side.  In Safari do the cmd+t and immediately switch/watch the terminal window for new connection. It should show established with in micro seconds.  <answer192296> There are a few things you can try:  ul liTurn off iCloud sync for Safari/li liSet "New tabs open with:" to "Empty Page" /li liBut for me, the culprit was "Retab" Safari extension./li /ul  <answer228583> Launch "Console" and have it running side by side with Safari. See if entries about "IMKServer" appear when the delay happens: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zAUYk.png" alt="screenshot"  If you see similar entries try following below: https://gist.github.com/WojtekKruszewski/3d5ff7f908a180b87498  Steps from the article:     ol   liReboot into system restore mode (+R immediately after boot)/li   liNavigate to Utilities  Terminal/li   liEnter the command codecsrutil disable/code /li   liReboot/li   liOpen Terminal/li   licodedefaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false &amp;&amp; launchctl remove $(launchctl list | grep -oE   'com.apple.PressAndHold.+$')/code/li   licodesudo chmod 000 /System/Library/Input\ Methods/PressAndHold.app/Contents/MacOS/PressAndHold/code /li   liReboot/li   liYou can choose reboot back into restore mode and issue codecrsutil enable/code again to re-enable rootless mode./li   /ol   It's originally from Github user squeeb: https://gist.github.com/squeeb/5a9dd082cae1b2d753a0 – I just forked the article to fix a typo in one command.  <answer244008> Disable "Include search engine suggestions", Open New Tab (⌘T) is fast again...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rhC5O.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer245652> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/22090.png" alt="enter image description here"This happened to me. And this fixed it for me.  Preferences - Search - uncheck "Show Favorites".  <comment223465> when you opening new tab, where does it go? (what is your home page)? <comment223679> I will try this when it starts happening again, thanks. <comment223680> @Buscar웃SD I would guess it doesn't matter because it happens with CMD+L as well. <comment224491> I noticed the CMD+L with a delay just now. But on subsequent tries, it was fast. Not sure if that helps at all. <comment224493> that variation does indicates a network speed variation. we need to catch it in the act :) Just try changing the default window (home) to Google.com and use the cmd+t again. Also just to test, turn off the Extension (if any) in the Safari. <comment243875> Set "New tabs open with:" to "Empty Page" fixed it for me. <comment278717> I'm experiencing the delay with "New tabs open with:" set to "Empty page", or "Favorites", both of which focus address bar and show suggestions. The delay disappears when I change the option to some home page or "about: blank", which do not focus address bar. But then I have to hit CMD-L to type address, and - lo and behold - we have the delay again. <comment278722> I'm experiencing this freeze this after clean install of El Capitan. It doesn't happen in "private" mode. <comment278727> Tried all above, removed all favorites and read items, disabled plugins and everything I could possibly disable in preferences - no effect. <comment282933> I enter "defaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false && launchctl remove $(launchctl list | grep -oE   'com.apple.PressAndHold.+$')" in terminal,it says "usage: grep [-abcDEFGHhIiJLlmnOoqRSsUVvwxZ] [-A num] [-B num] [-C[num]]  [-e pattern] [-f file] [--binary-files=value] [--color=when]  [--context[=num]] [--directories=action] [--label] [--line-buffered]  [--null] [pattern] [file ...] -bash: com.apple.PressAndHold.+$: command not found Usage: launchctl remove service-name".I'm using 10.11.3 <comment283034> @cuthead what's your output for `launchctl list | grep PressAndHold`? <comment283228> my output is nothing,in fact I use baidu wubi input method mac and this problem solved.I think this problem relate to OS X Chinese input method. <comment283319> SCIM[536]: IMKServer Stall detected, *please Report* your user scenario attaching a spindump (or sysdiagnose) that captures the problem - (sessionFinished) block performed very slowly (2.95 secs)  here is my console output
