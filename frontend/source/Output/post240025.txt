Why does Apple TV always show National Geographic screen saver? <body> My 3rd generation Apple TV has a small but annoying problem where it defaults to the National Geographic screen saver, regardless of what is set on the Screen Saver page.  I've chosen  Photos  Explore:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/E1RUt.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  The next panel shows that I've chosen Flickr (but the situation is identical if I instead choose iCloud photos).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DEHKC.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  After the Apple TV has been idle for 2 minutes the screen saver starts. Sometimes it shows 1 image from Flickr then immediately goes into a loop showing the National Geographic photos. Sometimes it shows Flickr photos for ~5 minutes before showing National Geographic.  The OS is set to automatic updates and there are no other issues. It's not exactly a show-stopper bug, just a bit annoying.  (This is the same problem as Screen saver settings keep defaulting back to National Geographic Photos but applies to Apple TV, not Mac.)
