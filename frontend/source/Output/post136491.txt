Can Automator's 'find finder items' ignore subfolders when searching? <body> I am using the Apple Automator to build a simple program that opens all the documents that belong to a project. All files are in the same folder and can be identified by the first characters of the file name; I am using the 'Find finder items'-action to find all these files, and then open them. However, there also files with similar names in a subfolder, that I do not want to open.  I would like the action to search only in the main folder, and to disregard the content of any subfolders. Is there a way to do this in Automator?  <answer136493> yes use the action "Ask for Folder Contents" (i hope its called like that on an English OS - I'm currently on a German one there it is called "Ordnerinhalt abfragen"), there you can say if you also wanna use subfolders or not.  I added a demo workflow for you.

I would like to open all of them automatically. <comment161934> there should be an action named "Selected Finder items" or if you like it really simple just drag'n'drop the Main Project Folder onto the right side of automator. <comment161949> Doesn't work for me…I can check the 'Do this for all subfolders' box, but it does noet seem to make a difference. <comment161950> if this doesn't work then your task may be to complex for Automator. then i recomend you to use the following Command inside a the Terminal. - cd /path/to/your/project/folder press enter - open name of files e.g. project_x_*.* press enter - if this also doesn't work Add a screenshot of the project folder and the files so we know about what we are talking. <comment161989> Sorry, my mistake…works now. Now using 'Get specified Finder items'  'Get folder contents'  'Filter Finder items'  'Open Finder items'.
