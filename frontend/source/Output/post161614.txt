Typing national characters in a slightly different way <body> Typical way of typing national characters (if you need to use them) on a keyboard looks as follows:  emThis is an example for Polish codeą/code character:/em  ol liPush codeALT/code./li liPush codea/code./li liRelease codea/code./li /ol  As a result we 'll see codeą/code on the screen.  Now, the strongquestion/strong: I am looking for slightly more convenient solution:  ol liPush and release codeALT/code./li liPush and release codea/code./li /ol  As a result we 'll see codeą/code on the screen as well.  I can easily configure emacs to behave like this. Do you know any hack/software or whatever which could allow me to use keyboard in all Mac applications?  Thanks!  <answer161639> Sticky Keys will do that.
