I can't open Network without my MacBook Pro crashing <body> I'm aware of the spontaneous reboot glitch as it happened many times before I found Apple's specifics on how to stop it, but starting earlier today, when I try to open System Preferences my MacBook Pro as per this fantastic tip I received this morning - which runs OSX - immediately crashes and restarts.  Is there something I'm doing that's overloading my computer?  That's precisely what I was trying to subvert.  EDIT: Specifically the strongcom.apple.preference.network.remoteservice/strong consistently crashes if I try to open Network Preferences.  <answer202175> In the Apple discussion thread, stronggchard/strong posted the same query.  strongLinc Davis/strong had the answer:   How to return your Network settings to default and get rid of the infinite spinning wheel.  <comment243837> After following the instructions, my Network settings work perfectly.
