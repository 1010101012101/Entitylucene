Kernel panic recurring <body> I keep getting the following kernel panic. Can anyone help me, please? As a test I have just change HDD to SSD and update memory from 2 GB to 8 GB. All said to be compatible with mac. Upgraded os x to Mountain Lion. Clean install from USB stick. Still the kernel panic happens a lot. What seems to be wrong?

In my experience, they most often have to do with hardware changes / external mounting and unmounting, but of course YMMV.  <answer127705> Its a probable RAM issue. Take out the RAM, clean them up, and put it again in the slots. It also happens when one of the RAM gets faulty, or is not properly attached.   <answer224978> I'd start with some general advice and follow the links at the bottom of the answer:  ul liWhat is a Kernel Panic and what does it mean?/li /ul  <comment108082> You might want to check the check if you just changed it. There is probably a faulty one. <comment108085> Check what? If its the ram and SSD they are completely new and OK. Same error happened over and over with old HDD and ram. Also that ran on Snow Leopard. <comment108150> Is it possible to read anything from the kernel panic above? <comment108263> Not unless you are a real adept at reading logs. Easier to examine what actions you might have taken, in conjunction with using Apple's info as linked.
