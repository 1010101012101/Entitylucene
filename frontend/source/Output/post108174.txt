Recover ssh private key from Keychain Access <body> I have OS X 10.8.5 – I just accidentally deleted my .ssh directory. I have backups, but would prefer not to have to go through the trouble. The keys still "work" right now (they're loaded into Keychain Access and I can ssh into remote hosts) but I assume they will be lost once I log out.  I tried finding the key in Keychain Access, right-clicking on it, clicking "Copy SSH: …", but that only seems to have copied the password for that key. Is there some way to recover the private key from Keychain Access?  <answer108186> "Export "SSH key"" (or whatever the name of your key is) should be available below the copy and removal options in the right-click context menu of a key in keychain access.  Don't you see an option for export?  <answer108188> Maybe you could try and see if your deleted code.ssh/code files are still found in a hidden place inside the hard drive: code/Volumes/{your_hard_disk_name}/.Trashes/code.  See this tutorial for how to make code.Trashes/code readable: http://www.wikihow.com/Recover-Accidentally-Deleted-Files-in-OS-X  <comment126865> What's the type of your key line in Keychain Access? Is it listed as a 'private key', or an 'application password'? In the latter case you don't actually have the SSH key in your keychain, but just the password for it. <comment126866> Unfortunately, no, and I just realized why – it's not a key I'm looking at. It's the "application password" for the key file. <comment126919> I did look there, and sadly there are no remnants of the file there.
