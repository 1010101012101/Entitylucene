Multiuser - can process of background user kept running? <body> On my Mac I use three user accounts. From what I understand when I'm logged in as one the processes of the other accounts are suspended. I switch between them with fast user switching.  My question is - can one assure that some processes keep running? Searching I found a few hints how to do on command line - but I'm considering to let a graphic application - like Steam - update itself for one user, and work as another user at the same time.  <answer83864> I'm confident your premise is false.  When another user logs in to Mac OS X using the fast user switching, the GUI processes of other users are strongnot/strong suspended, but do continue to run in the background.  As long as you don't stronglog out/strong of the other accounts, their Finder process and programs launched as that user should continue to run in the background.  For instance, as I type this with my primary codecwrea/code account on my Mac mini, I have another codesampleuser/code account logged in (at the same time), and that user has a Safari window open that is playing a YouTube video.  emRight now./em  Then, if I load Activity Monitor while having my account codecwrea/code in the foreground and select to view em"Other User Processes"/em, Activity Monitor is reporting consistent ~8% CPU usage by a specific process named "PluginProcess" strongowned by the codesampleuser/code account./strong  Moreover, if I switch back to codesampleuser/code's login session via fast user switching, the video is at a time location beyond where I left it, consistent with where it would be if I hadn't switched to my main account in the interim.  For what it's worth, the emsound/em (and emvideo/em, obviously) of the other background login session are emsuppressed/em, in that I don't hear or see either, but I can't find any evidence that graphical programs necessarily are suspended or cease operating in the background.  <comment96560> That would be a relief. I will run a few tests if this also holds when I have some "demanding" program. But then I'll mark this a solution.
