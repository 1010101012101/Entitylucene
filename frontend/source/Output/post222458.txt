Show all windows on hover/click doc icon (Mac Yosemite 10.10.5) <body> I just switched from Windows to Mac and having a hard time figuring out this.   In Windows, when I click on the application icon in task bar, it shows me all the open windows and then I can open any of the window. Is there a way to do same in Mac? Basically I want to see all the open windows when I click/hover on the open application icon in the doc.  Currently I'm doing following but not liking it - * Use codeCMD +/code' to switch between open windows * Set hotspot corner to show all windows.   But given I'm so used to click the icon to show the window, I want to do same in Mac too.  Any advice appreciated  Thanks  <answer222529> Double tap (not click) the open application icon. This will display all open windows for that application and you can select the one you need.  If you are using a non-Apple mouse/trackpad you can right click or two-finger click an open application icon to reveal a list. The top entries are the open windows for that application. You can then select one of the open windows from that list.  <answer222536> Alternative to existing solution, which is right clicking on the app icon in the Dock and clicking on the desired window:  Enable Exposé in System Preferences  Trackpad  App Exposé (for trackpad shortcut) or System Preferences  Mission Control  Application windows (for keyboard shortcut).  Then use your Exposé shortcut to show all the open windows for your emcurrent/em application. This emwill not/em show full screen windows. To see emother applications' windows/em click that application's icons in the dock emwhile in Exposé mode/em.  Then click the window you want to give it focus.  Exposé includes windows on other desktops and minimized windows.  <comment269686> You should say "right click" or "two finger click", as "double tap" can be confused to mean "double click" especially for iOS users and trackpad users
