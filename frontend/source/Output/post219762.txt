How to fix GUID hard drive corrupted to MBR? <body> I have a micro SD that suddenly stopped working. I tried everything on the internet (believe me, everything). I don't mind losing the data on it, I just want to be able to use it again. So here I go:  ol liI have a 64GB micro SD... Does the 409642 number for the first offset still apply? (How do I make the red lines straight?)/li liThe micro SD was formatted at the beginning with exFAT but after messing a lot with the formatting I think it is now MBR. I had only 1 partition. Will it work?/li liWhen I go to the offset 409642 I don't see a single 00, and it is full with numbers and letters. I'm uploading a screenshot:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/78I7d.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liI only want to have 1 partition... What should I do?/li /ol  I'm using a Micro SD adapter and I have OS X El Capitan (10.11.2)  <comment265791> You don't care about the data, but you can't just reformat it? It would have to be pretty screwed up for reformatting to not work. Have you tried it? <comment265818> To get straight red lines you have to resize the window. The pane in the middle should show the bytes 0x00-0x1F.
