`Unknown` file download after reload in Safari 8.0 on OS X Yosemite <body> Since upgrading to OS X Yosemite I've experienced that sometimes when reloading a web page (CMD+R) Safari doesn't reload the page but downloads a file named codeUnknown/code.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/64iAC.png" width="436" title="OS X Yosemite Safari Refresh Downloads Unknown File"  Is there any way to fix this?  <answer166952> I suspect it is not an empty file but malware from 'carpet bombing'. Do not attempt to open the file but get info on the file and you should see it is from known malicious sites. I am scanning my system right now using ClamXav and nothing is coming up bad so I suspect it will go away if you just keep trashing the files until the hacker gives up. If anyone knows more than this please contribute.  <comment186707> Did you ever figure this out? It's such a pain! <comment186744> @Rog Unfortunately no <comment188902> I'm having the same issue. Not always, but on occasions pressing Cmd+R to reload, just results in a download of an empty file named 'Unknown'. It's somewhat annoying.
