Stop Reachability from automatically reverting to normal <body> I enjoy Reachability but it always automatically turns off when I click something. For example, go into Setting and enable Reachability. Then click on Wifi. The u.i. will snap back to use all of the screen. I would like there to be a way to force Reachability to stay on until I turn it off with a double tap. This means I also wish to disable the Reachability timer.   <comment331160> Seems my ask is impossible without jailbreak. Can someone verify?
