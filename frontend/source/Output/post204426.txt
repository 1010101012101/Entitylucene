Get pages and iMovies free <body> I got macbook pro late 2013 and normally codePages/code and codeiMovies/code they are free for mac after 2013 but when I got to app store I can't get them for free. Any help here or how to get them free ?  <answer204432> You can check the app store in the purchased section to see if the apps are there, normally if you're using a brand new mac you should be able to find them there. If you bought a second hand mac I don't think you'll be able to get them for free (legally).   There is something i tried a long time ago i'm not sure it's still working, you need to download the iWork â€™09 trial Install it, open all of the apps (pages,numbers and keynote), quit the apps, launch the appstore and then update them.  I have no idea how to get iMovies for free.  <comment246407> Judging by the purchase date on my iMovies, I got mine free with a new iPhone, which allowed me to download for Mac too.
