When acting as a "Personal Hotspot", does an iPhone ever do anything beyond routing? <body> I want to use the iPhone's codePersonal Hotspot/code feature as my primary connection to the internet. I'm a little nervous about placing my iPhone at risk to hacking.  Does codePersonal Hotspot/code perform any action above the emnetwork layer/em in the TCP / IP stack?br Are the IP packets that are routed through the iPhone ever at risk of being organized into an executable, and then being executed as malware on my iPhone? That would be impossible, right?  <comment279034> (unconfirmed) I expect it also will enable Handover? <comment282209> Basically impossible, yes. Personal Hotspot is safe.
