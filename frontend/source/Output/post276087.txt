How to use Maildrop on original iPad mini? <body> I have an original iPad mini running iOS 9.3. When sending large eMail attachments, it doesn't ask me if I want to use Maildrop and fails miserably.  My iPhone SE offers me to use Maildrop though  How can I convince the iPad to try Maildrop?  Apple's support page says that the only requirement is iOS 9.2.   https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204230
