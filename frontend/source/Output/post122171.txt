How do I rotate the pictures of my iPhone/iPad wallpaper every few minutes? <body> I want the wallpaper on my iPhone/iPad to rotate/change to a new wallpaper every few minutes, so that I won't get bored seeing the same picture over and over again every time I'm on my phone.   Are there any strongfree/strong iPhone apps which allow me to do so?  <answer122180> Unfortunately, I don't think it's possible to change the wallpaper at a set amount of time. It has to be done manually.   I'm pretty sure this is to save battery life.   <answer157089> It is not possible. You will have to do it manually.  <answer201635> There are lots of ways to do this.  First Jailbreak your iDevice.  Then once your device is jailbroken look up winterboard.  install winterboard and find tweak option for changing wallpapers.  <comment190197> Is your iPhone/iPad jailbroken by any chance? That would change the situation and some workarounds would be possible then. <comment190243> @bart how can it be done assuming my iphone is jailbroken ?
