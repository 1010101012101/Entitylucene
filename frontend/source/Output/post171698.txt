Yosemite Spotlight Calculator suddenly stopped working <body> I use Spotlight's Calculator feature occasionally, but I've noticed that it has stopped working recently.  Instead I get a  "No Results" message:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/t6cFv.png" alt="Example calculation not working"  I've verified that Calculator is enabled in Spotlight System Preferences.  Restarting the computer does not help.  I also tried disabling and re-enabling the Calculator setting in Spotlight.  Any other ideas?  <answer171778> Delete the spotlight preferences file:  precode~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Spotlight.plist /code/pre  And then reboot. I was having the same problem and that fixed it for me.  <comment202022> did you try with 0.1 instead of .1 <comment202047> Just tried, same problem.  Also a problem with just `33*44` <comment202142> Any chance you've deleted the calculator app? (Not sure if it makes a difference, but might as well look into it.) <comment202278> That fixed it, thanks! <comment203941> A day later, with no system changes on my end, the spotlight calculator stopped working again. Have you had similar behavior on your end? <comment203945> I ended up calling Apple Support; their solution was to reinstall my operating system. Good times! <comment203972> No, mine's been working for about a week now. I hope it stays that way.
