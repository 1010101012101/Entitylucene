Ubuntu Macbook Air no access to boot when holding OPTION <body> I have installed ubuntu on my Air and have it running for over 6 months now. Today I run a software update and grub wanted to update and I selected it to not change anything / update and well it did! rEFIt was installed.   Now when I reboot I have no chime on boot, when I hold OPTION it does nothing and goes straight to GRUB. I have no way of getting back into OS X.  Also the Air doesn't have a DVD drive so I can't put any disks in.   As I can't access the boot selector when holding option I have no way of booting a USB.   Anyone have any ideas?    Thanks in advanced.   <comment92248> Question also posted here: http://askubuntu.com/questions/247484/mac-wont-boot-into-os-x-after-update#comment307772_247484  This is urgent I really need some help :) <comment92288> Have you tried resetting PRAM? Hold down Command-Option-P-R just after the reboot chime. <comment92295> It's OK I went to my Apple store and the techie had a look. Turns out holding OPTION + R bypasses everything and goes straight into recovery.
