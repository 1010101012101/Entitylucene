Can't import Comodo email certificates on my second device <body> I've got two email certificates from Comodo which I want to use on both of my Macs. My primary machine works fine. After downloading the certificate files (.p7s) I double-clicked them and they were properly imported in my keychain where I can see them under 'My certificates'. When I do the same on my second device the keychain asks me where to import the certificate (which it didn't on my first machine). I select 'Anmeldung' (Login?) and there they go. But Apple Mail doesn't 'see' those certificates, thus I can't use them.  I'm using the iCloud Keychain. May that be the reason? And if, how can I workaround that problem? I can see my contact's certificates which I'm using to encrypt mails in my keychain on my second Mac although I've received their certificate on my first Mac. That's why I'm asking regarding the iCloud Keychain.  Both machines are on macOS Sierra 10.12.1.
