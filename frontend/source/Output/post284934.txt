Enabling mouse for Mission Control? <body> So on my personal MacBookPro w/ Magic Mouse I use Apple-2nd button to enable Mission Control.  However on my work MBP &amp; Magic Mouse I can't enable it because the second set of drop downs isn't available in the UI:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BZqf5.png" alt="enter image description here"  Note that my Mission Control settings are configured in the Keyboard settings since OS X "migrates" those settings there. (why apple why?)  Both are OS X Sierra (work is 10.12.5).  I'm going to assume it has something to do with the mouse that was previous used with this MBP (IT originally configured it with a USB mighty mouse), but I don't know how to tell OS X to reset the config.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qBJyN.png" alt="s"
