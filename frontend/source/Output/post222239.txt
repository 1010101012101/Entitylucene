Speed reading on iPad <body> I want to speed read on I pad. I have Kindle app and iBooks installed. In order to do that I need to split the screen by two vertical lines so as per image.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3rpgE.jpg" alt="enter image description here"   Is there any software I can use for that can split the screen like that?  <answer233608> Just draw the lines in the screen or use a screen protector and draw the lines with a marker. There are removable screen protectors so you can use it when you read and remove once you're done fast reading.
