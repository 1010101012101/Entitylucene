trying to connect yahoo account to new MacBook Air <body> through system preferences  internet accounts  i enter my yahoo user id and password and am getting error message "unable to verify user id and password"  i have enabled POP in my yahoo account and reset password to ensure it's accurate.   <answer254385> That error is not due to an incorrect pass, that would be along the lines of, "wrong password email combination", that is just saying its unable to complete the transaction between yahoo, and your MBA. Login to your yahoo, and check if it has denied it login, due to being something like a, suspicious login. If thats not the case then there must be an issue with Yahoo, do you own an email account of another provider you could try? Before ruling it out as an issue with your MBA.   <answer254985> In Apple Mail, add a new account and after entering a full name, email address and password, hold down the Option key. The Create button will change to Continue, allowing one to manually configure the account settings.  Use the following settings:  Incoming Server - imap.mail.yahoo.com Outgoing Server - smtp.mail.yahoo.com Incoming Port - 993 (requires SSL) Outgoing Port - 465 (requires SSL/TLS) Username: full email address (example: bill@yahoo.com) Password: the password you login to Yahoo with.  Make sure to identify four mailboxes as special: Drafts, Trash, Sent and Bulk Mail (Junk). For example, in the left pane under the heading "On My Mac" under the Yahoo account, select the Draft folder. Then on the menu bar select Mailbox  Use This Mailbox For  Drafts.  Do this for the other 3 mailboxes to make sure your mail gets sorted correctly.
