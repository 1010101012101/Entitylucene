Spotlight can't find apps or folder, only seaches the web <body> My Spotlight can't find any apps, even the native ones. It only returns results from web searches. With a little googling I found out that a pretty common solution to that is to rebuild the indexes. The problem is I can't do that: I tried a solution using the os interface (solution 1), but got the following error message:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xnKDr.png" alt="enter image description here"  An then I tried a manual solution, using the terminal (solution 2), but then this happened:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jkKNU.png" alt="enter image description here"  I don't know what else to try. Does anyone have been through that? I'm using El Capitan latest version (10.11.6). Thanks!  PS.: I tried to post the link to each solution, but I can't post more than 2 links because of my reputation. If someone needs them, I can share on the comment section.  <answer251548> In Finder, go up to where it says "Finder" in bold in the menubar (upper left) and select "Preferences." Under the "Advanced" tab, make sure "When Performing a Search: Search this Mac" is selected.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Mh6FL.png" alt="Finder Preferences"  Then go into System Preferences and select "Spotlight." Under "Search Results," make sure everything is checked off.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pqnL9.png" alt="Spotlight Preferences"  strongEDIT #1:/strong  Go into System Preferences  Spotlight  Security. Make sure your list is empty. This is a list of files NOT to search, and if your drive is listed, it won't search it.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AZNJg.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer251560> Obviously, Spotlight's index is misbehaving, and you did the right thing using the mdutil command. If repeating that command merely provides the same "Index is already changing state..." result, then the situation requires you to manually remove Spotlight's data directory. It's simple enough to do and it's perfectly safe, but it would still be wise to run a backup before proceeding. Then:  1.) In the Terminal, issue the command  precodesudo rm -r /.Spotlight-V100 /code/pre  2.) Restart in Safe Mode  ul liRestart your Mac, and immediately after you hear the startup sound, press and hold the Shift key./li liRelease the Shift key when you see the Apple logo appear on the screen./li /ul  3.) Restart (in standard mode) after Safe Mode startup is complete. Spotlight will begin indexing using the preferences you have set for it.  <comment312736> Thanks for the answer! However, my Finder preferences were already set to that, altough you have more options in yours. ([image](http://imgur.com/a/SiKST)). Also, in Spotlight preferences, every options is checked, like your screenshot. Any more ideas? <comment312737> Is [this](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201716) how you rebuilt the indexes? Is that what gave you the "Privacy List Error?" Are you an admin on your computer? <comment312739> See my **EDIT #1** in the above answer. <comment313187> Thanks! It worked! Also: very good explanation! I would leave an upvote, but don't have reputation to do so! <comment313188> Tried that, but always got the error I show in that first image. Doc G. solution solves the issue, but thanks for helping! :) <comment313478> **Update:** I need to repeat the process each time I turn on my mac, but instead of restarting, I'm doing: `sudo rm -r /.Spotlight-V100` `sudo mdutil -i off` `sudo mdutil -i on`  Do you have any idea of how to fix this permanently... <comment313506> This is the first I've heard of Spotlight needing to be continually reset with every restart. I'll look around for possible answers, but I have no advice for you now. Sorry, Miguel. <comment313562> No worries Doc! Thanks for all the help! :)
