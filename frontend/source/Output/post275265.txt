why is my text being sent back to me from my contact? <body> Whenever i send a text to a specific contact ( just one of my contacts) I immediately receive a reply text from that contact but it is my exact text! This is so annoying how do I fix it? I don't even know if that person is receiving the text on their end. I am using an iPhone 7 and the person I am texting has an iPhone 6s Plus. It just started happening. I text this contact all the time and it just started doing that.  <comment346219> Are there any error messages?  What app are you using to send the text messages?  Can you include a picture on your question so we can see the screen after this happens?
