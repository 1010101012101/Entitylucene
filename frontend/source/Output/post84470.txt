Change the default Dock stack content display style <body> I love the Dock stacks. But I always use the list view option. I don't really fancy the default "Automatic" option. Do you know if it is possible (maybe using the codedefaults/code command?) to set the default way to display the content of a Dock stack?  Thanks in advance for your help! :-)   <answer84488> I haven't seen a option like this. But you can always right click on your stack and select a fixed way to show that specific stack.  Although, maybe you can find this option using this: Secrets. This is a app that gives you a lot of hidden options.  <answer84496> This would change the style of all stacks to list, but you have to relaunch Dock to apply the changes:  codefor n in {0..19}; do /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c "Set persistent-others:$n:tile-data:showas 3" ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Dock.plist; done 2&gt; /dev/null/code  You could run it every 8 hours by running codeEDITOR=nano crontab -e/code and adding a line like code0 */8 * * * for n in .../code.  <comment357734> User mark steward says this solution "knocks out ability in Safari to view local image files in local edited HTML"
