Where does OS X store the list of disabled fonts? <body> I am using Font Book a lot and manage my fonts with it. Now, I want to back up all my settings.  I found my collections in ~/Library/Font Collections  But where does OS X store which fonts are disabled? I want to copy this "list" and move it to my new mac.  <answer88680> I don't have codeFonts Disabled/code folders either, but the list of disabled fonts is stored in code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.FontRegistry.user.plist/code. If you copy it to another computer, run codesudo atsutil databases -remove; atsutil server -shutdown/code to apply the changes.  <answer88721> Where the list of disabled fonts is stored depends on the version of OS X you are using.  First of all, the code~/Library/Fonts Disabled//code and code/Library/Fonts Disabled/code have never been used by Apple for the handling of disabled fonts; rather, fonts are simply deactivated in place: there's no need to move them out of the /Fonts/ folder in order to deactivate them. Those folders are most likely created by the Microsoft Office installer for Mac, or some other application installer.  As I mentioned, where the list of deactivated fonts is stored depends on the version of OS X you're using.  OS X 10.3: code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.ATS.plist/code stores a list of file paths to the fonts which have been disabled in Font Book.  OS X 10.4 â€” 10.6: The enabled or disabled state of a particular font is stored within the font cache files themselves. There is no saved external record (like the preference file used in 10.3) of which fonts were disabled.  In OS X 10.7.x and later, while the enabled or disabled state of a particular font is still stored within the font cache files themselves, an external record of which fonts were disabled is stored in code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.FontRegistry.user.plist/code.  <comment103933> Thanks, that's the file I was looking for :-) <comment103976> I didn't realize that the '~/Library/Fonts Disabled' and '/Library/Fonts Disabled' folders that I noted in my post are specifically for fonts used by Microsoft Office for Mac 2008/2011. Sorry for the confusion, I've deleted my post.
