What is the difference between a tap and a click? <body> I can click on both my Magic Trackpad and my Magic Mouse but I can tap on neither, if my understanding is correct.   On my Magic Mouse all I can do is click. Same with Magic Trackpad.  What am I missing? I have searched web but it is hard to get relevant answers. I am using a mid 2011 iMac with 10.11 beta but this has bothered me since Lion. I have enabled Tap to click, but the situation is the same and my basic question is what is the difference?   Edit 2  After several reboots the trackpad now responds to tap, mouse does not.  <answer206627> According to this article: Turning On Mac Touch-To-Click Support from the Command Line you have to enable the feature in the command line:  Enable the general tap-to-click behavior:  precodesudo defaults write com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.trackpad Clicking -bool true /code/pre  Enables tap-to-click for the Magic Mouse:  precodesudo defaults -currentHost write NSGlobalDomain com.apple.mouse.tapBehavior -int 1 /code/pre  Enable tap-to-click at the login and boot screens of OS X:  precodesudo defaults write NSGlobalDomain com.apple.mouse.tapBehavior -int 1 /code/pre  and reboot your Mac.  To disable all this enter in Terminal:  precodesudo defaults write com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.trackpad Clicking -bool false sudo defaults -currentHost write NSGlobalDomain com.apple.mouse.tapBehavior -int 0 sudo defaults write NSGlobalDomain com.apple.mouse.tapBehavior -int 0 /code/pre  and reboot again.  <comment249041> You can enable tap to click on your Trackpad.
