How can I listen to Audible books on macOS at faster speed? <body> It appears that I'm not given any options at all in the Audible Cloud player, unlike in the Kindle iOS app, particularly for the playback speed. Does anyone know if it's possible to listen to Audible books at a higher speed on macOS? Maybe if I plugged in my device to my laptop? Thanks in advance!
