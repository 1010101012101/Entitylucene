How to upgrade my login shell from bash version 3 to 4? <body> Current I am running   precode$ echo $BASH_VERSION $ 3.2.57(1)-release /code/pre  I have the new shell in  precode/usr/local/bin/bash /code/pre  and I can run it directly with  precode/usr/local/bin/bash $ echo $BASH_VERSION $ 4.3.42(1)-release /code/pre  I have done   precode$ chsh -s /usr/local/bin/bash /code/pre  <answer285716> I needed to fully quit the terminal application in order for the changes to take effect.  osx is different in this way as it leaves applications 'open' even when all current window occurrences of it are closed.  <comment360413> Did you add `/usr/local/bin/bash` to `/private/etc/shells`? <comment360426> I did not.  Did not need to. <comment364646> I don't think you can expect different behavior on any other U*x.
