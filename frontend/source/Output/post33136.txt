Project Management Software recommendation <body> Is there any good project management software for MacOS?  <answer33639> I use and love OmniPlan by the Omni Group. Much like MS project except that it is easier to understand, is much more economically priced and it looks good. There are some sample videos on the web page.   If you are looking for a MS Project replacement, this is it IMHO.  <comment37811> There sure is, but the definition of "good" will depend on your specific requirements. Can you elaborate more about what kind of project you are going to manage? <comment37815> You want a native Mac app or a web app is also ok?  Redmine which is a web app might be worth looking for. <comment41581> Welcome to Ask Different! "Good" will be different for everybody. We can't tell you what application to use only based on the criteria "good" or "the best." Please ask again with specific requirements for the app (detailed feature set, where you want it to be strong, etc). Please take a look at the [FAQs](http://apple.stackexchange.com/faq) for more info. Thanks.
