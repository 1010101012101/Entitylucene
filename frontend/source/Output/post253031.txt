Add data point in Health app <body> Is there a way to add a data point for steps and workouts in the Apple Health app in iOS 10? I cannot find it.  <answer253034> From the main screen (Health Data), tap on Activity, then the item you want to add a data point for (Steps, Walking + Running Distance, etc.)  From there, tap on the + in the upper-right hand corner and you can enter a new data point.
