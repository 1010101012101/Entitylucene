Does MagSafe 2 T Connector get really hot when charging? <body> I've a Macbook Pro Retina 15" Late 2013. My MagSafe 2 connector (T connector) gets really hot when charging.  Is it normal ??  <answer254171> Yes. In my case, my new MacBook Pro Retina 13" MagSafe connector gets insanely hot but once the charge level reaches above 50% or so, it starts to cool down and then stays lukewarm.   The best solution is to not let the Mac's battery discharge too much. It also doesn't make much of a difference to the heat level if your Mac is on or sleeping as the heat level in both cases are similarly high.  <comment192998> Yeah, I think so, mine is hot too, sometimes. <comment193016> What is really hot? How warm is the air temperature where you charge? Is the Mac off? <comment193130> While mac working & charging (Orange light). Around 60C <comment316411> It could be due to the applications that are running, consuming your CPU. <comment316424> getting hot is normal. +1.
