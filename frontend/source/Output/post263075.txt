Deleting files but, disk space doesn't stay free - not due to time machine <body> After hitting the ceiling on my 256 GB SSD, I deleted around 20 GB to free up disk space. Unfortunately, almost every time I start the MacBook, it issues a warning, that the startup disk is almost full. Seemingly at random, checking the free disk space actually provides the 20 GB of free disk space but after a while it falls down to a few MB (!). I already tried disabling Time Machine's Local Snapshots:  strongsudo tmutil disablelocal/strong   but that didn't help.  System Specs: El Capitan - 10.11.6 on a late 2013 MacBook Pro  P.S.: this is not a duplicate of Over 25 gb os Space Disappeared  <comment354501> Me too. 10GB deleted and only 300 MB freed up on 500GB drive.
