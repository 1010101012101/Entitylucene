Why is the number of unread messages in Messages negative? <body> Occasionally, and with no apparent correlation with what is going on on other devices where I have Messages enabled, I get a negative count for my unread messages in Messages on OS X:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/V3kNa.png" alt="enter image description here"  What could be causing this, and how can I prevent from happening in the future?  <answer93982> I believe that negative numbers show up when you read a message on another device before you read it on what ever device has the negative number. I had the same thing happen to me. I have a "-1" badge on my Messages icon.  <comment77415> I can't help with a solution or workaround but this is clearly a bug and you should report it: https://developer.apple.com/bugreporter/ <comment87967> I'm stuck at 1 (positive) unread message, despite having read all messages. Clearly bugs here. Thanks for reporting.
