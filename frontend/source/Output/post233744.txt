Issues with files and folders with names containing umlauts <body> I have just noticed some issues browsing my external music collection using Finder, certain artists folders were missing.  Going to iTerm and codels/codeing the folder I got this as the initial report:  precodels Music ls: Maná: No such file or directory ls: Márta Sebestyén: No such file or directory ls: Motörhead: No such file or directory ls: Zoë Keating: No such file or directory /code/pre  Note that the artists names use umlauts and Double acute accents.  This is a folder on a NAS box (ReadyNAS 204) via smb, I also have back up of the NAS running Ubuntu access via CIFS.   Using Finder on OS X El Capitan neither the NAS or backup show these folders. However using Yosemite I can see the Artists folder but the albums are missing.  Logging in directly to the boxes all files appear to be intact and SONOS can still play them!  Has some thing changed in OS X, I used max to rip these from CD's (Snow Leopard) so I had to be able to handle the files at some point ‽   NB: ‽ is an interrobang   h2Update with a little more info/h2  Using rsync from the Mac to copy music on to USB (OS X Extended format) drive I see things like:  precodersync -av --iconv=utf8-mac,utf8 /Volumes/share/Music/ /Volumes/usbdisk/Music/  file has vanished: "/Volumes/share/Music/.../Márta Sebestyén" file has vanished: "/Volumes/share/Music/.../Maná" file has vanished: "/Volumes/share/Music/.../Zoë Keating" file has vanished: "/Volumes/share/Music/.../Rammstein-2005-Rosenrot-07-Zerstören.flac" /code/pre  ssh'ing on to Ubuntu server and using convmv as described here:  precodecd /mnt/Music convmv -r -f ISO-8859-1 -t UTF-8 .  /code/pre  It returns :  precodeStarting a dry run without changes... Skipping, already UTF-8: ./Márta Sebestyén Skipping, already UTF-8: ./Maná Skipping, already UTF-8: ./Michael Bublé Skipping, already UTF-8: ./Zoë Keating Skipping, already UTF-8: ./Rammstein/1999-Live aus Berlin/Rammstein-1999-Live aus Berlin-10-Bück dich.flac Skipping, already UTF-8: ./Rammstein/1999-Live aus Berlin/Rammstein-1999-Live aus Berlin-03-Weißes Fleisch.flac No changes to your files done. Use --notest to finally rename the files. /code/pre  It looks like the main files having issues are already utf-8 but note the file "Rammstein-2005-Rosenrot-07-Zerstören.flac" that rsync had issue with is not listed in the above report.   I also used brew to install the latest vesion of rsync 3+ rather than the 2.6 version that is used be default.  precodebrew tap homebrew/dupes brew install rsync /code/pre  And then edit /private/etc/paths to put /usr/local/bin before /usr/bin  h2Trying out AFP/h2  Enabling AFP on Ready NAS (OS 6.4.2), well this was a little freaky for me. Structure is codeArtist/Album/Tracks.flac/code. Artists are there, album was there, expand the album to see tracks the Artists folder disappeared.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qWoCq.png" alt="Artist"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zw7MK.png" alt="Album"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9XjwQ.png" alt="Artists vanished when trying to view tracks"  h2ReadyNAS smb.conf/h2  precode[global]  dos charset = CP1252  unix charset = UTF-8 /code/pre  h2Related Info/h2  Folders not showing up in Finder?br CIFS &amp; MAC problems with special characters in folder names .  <comment285833> I tried to reproduce your problem in a ReadyNAS-OS-6.4.2 virtual machine but I don't have any problems accessing a ReadyNAS with folder names containing umlauts using 10.8-10.11. I assume it's related to /etc/samba/smb.conf. Please add the content (related to charsets) of the file. Did you also try to access the folders via AFP? <comment310201> The problem is, that in El Capitan the filesystem replaces umlauts with the normal letter followed by a diaresis marker, so it makes from one character, lets say »ä« 'LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH DIAERESIS' (U+00E4) two characters, in this example »a« 'LATIN SMALL LETTER A' (U+0061) followed by the diaresis marker » ̈« 'COMBINING DIAERESIS' (U+0308). This is also a problem when you download a file with umlauts in its name and then re-upload this file again to the server. Then you suddenly have two files on the server. <comment323952> Is there any news on this issue? It seems I have similar issues when trying to copy&paste a file with umlauts from an AFP share: Finder shows them properly, but copy&paste isn't working. <comment323960> I did not make any progress in solving the issue.
