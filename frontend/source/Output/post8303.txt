How do I migrate my Aperture library from my primary HDD to an external drive? <body> I have about 53GB of photos in my Aperture library which is stored on my internal HDD. I would like to move this library onto an external hard disk and continue to use Aperture without any loss of images, etc.   Is there anyway I can do this?   <answer8304> Yes you can, here are the steps:    ul liConnect your external disk/li liOpen Finder and go to code&lt;your home folder&gt;/Pictures/code/li limove the Aperture Library.aplibrary file to a location on your new disk/li liOpen Aperture and go to preferences ( from menu or by pressing kbdâŒ˜/kbd+kbd,/kbd )/li liOn the General tab, change the location of the library to where you copied the Aperture Library.aplibrary file/li /ul  That's it, the library is now on your external drive.  <answer14877> Or before opening Aperture, hold down the Option/Alt key then click o Aperture to open. Aperture will ask you where your library is, then you can point it to your external drive.    <comment8994> ALso if you just double-click on the Aperture library from the new drive, it will open Aperture using that library and keep doing so until it cannot find it.
