Why can't I change my macbook's backlight? <body> So apparently I cannot modify my Macbook's backlight using the keyboard shortcut:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/X2lq3.png" alt="enter image description here"  I'm pretty sure it will work again if I restart it. But I wonder what may cause this: is it perhaps an issue with my hardware, or just some OS glitch caused by something insignificant?  Macbook Pro Retina, 15" mid 2014. El Capitan 10.11.  <answer212381> You set it with the F5 and F6 keys, and it should not change after that, except for the setting SystemPreferences-Keyboard-Keyboard  "adjust keyboard brightness in low light".
