Where does the sudo .bashrc file reside? <body> Where doe the sudo .bashrc file reside? I'd like to add some things to it.  <answer287582> em.bashrc/em is usually in code/Users/your_username//code  To access this path, open Terminal :  code$ open ~/.bashrc/code  <answer287583> see codeman bash/code under codeFILES/code  precode/bin/bash          The bash executable /etc/profile          The systemwide initialization file, executed for login shells ~/.bash_profile          The personal initialization file, executed for login shells ~/.bashrc          The individual per-interactive-shell startup file ~/.bash_logout          The  individual  login shell cleanup file, executed when a login               shell exits ~/.inputrc          Individual readline initialization file /code/pre  <answer287595> I prefer to use codesudo --set-home/code and/or codesudo --login/code when I care about the dot files so that the environment gets set up more like the normal user than the restricted environment.  This seems a bit like an XY problem though, it really depends on what you are trying to do if setting up a proper root user with a proper environment is needed or if you can modify the sudo behavior using standard flags and functionality.  You can find the home folders generally with this set of commands:  precodesudo -s who am i whoami pwd /code/pre  In the first case, you are the normal user with root - sticking to the old user home folder and dot files. If you instead do codesudo --login/code you'll see the home folder for root. By default it is code/var/root/code  <comment363111> I know where my .bashrc file is. I'm wondering where ´sudo´ a.k.a. roots .bashrc file is. <comment363122> There isn't a "sudo  .bashrc". `sudo` uses the callers environment modified as prescribed in `/private/etc/sudoers`. What is your goal? <comment363128> @fd0 I have an alias in my normal .bashrc, however when running sudo it doesn't pick it up. <comment363132> Which of these files are read in the situation described in the question?
