iMovie 13 Green-screen effect not working <body> I am editing a video that involves a green screen. Whenever I put in a certain scene, the green screen doesn't work.   This only happens for that specific scene.  By doesn't work, I mean when I put the clip I want to have a background of on top of the background, iMovie puts that scene over the background, instead of detecting the green screen and putting in the background. It is almost like it thinks that the clip is the background, and my background is the clip. Ill give some screen shots too.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KXTIg.jpg" alt=""  You can see that my the clip on top of the green hills (the highlighted one) is behind the clip of my friend, hence the white circles around the scene, indicating that it is in front. This does not happen for any other clip.
