quick to install and set up FTP server on homebrew for OSX <body> I need the smallest and easiest FTP server just to grab some files during development.  Homebrew has a discrete selection codebrew search ftp/code but I'm unsure which is the quickest to setup.  I don't want to use the builtin FTP server.  Any recommendations?  <answer141637> As of writing, codebrew search ftp/code returns the following FTP servers:  ul lipure-ftpd/li livsftpd/li liproftpd/li /ul  Based on their websites, codepure-ftpd/code appears to be your best choice for easy installation.  h2pure-ftpd/h2     Beginners can install a Pure-FTPd server in 5 minutes. It can be as simple as installing the package, typing codepure-ftpd &amp;/code and… that’s all. You already have a running server, and clients can start to connect.   h2vsftpd/h2     vsftpd is a GPL licensed FTP server for UNIX systems, including Linux. It is secure and extremely fast. It is stable.   h2ProFTPD/h2     ProFTPD grew out of the desire to have a secure and configurable FTP server, and out of a significant admiration of the Apache web server.   <comment166902> Why not CLI, terminal? <comment166903> Is there a specific reason not to use the builtin one? What exactly do you mean by "grab some files"? <comment166908> patrix: yes, the same reason for which you can get your question closed as 'off topic' here :) for "grab some files" I just mean that my code connects to the FTP server and downloads them, that's it Neeku: unsure what you mean, just trying to figure out the easier FTP server in homebrew <comment166919> Ok @JohnSmith. I had misunderstood your question at first. Also remember to put an "@" before the usernames so that they get notified of your comments. <comment166923> I did but it won't let me mention two names in the same comment, I should have known better. Cheers!
