Why I'm getting this message: "Interface cannot be used (error 229)" <body> I've plugged an USB NFC/RFID reader, model ACR112U-A9 provided by ACS Ltd.  Although it is plugged I can't read anything and I keep getting this logs in console:  precode09/06/15 14:13:00,901 com.apple.SecurityServer[83]: reader ACS ACR122U PICC Interface: state changed 16 -&gt; 34 09/06/15 14:13:00,902 com.apple.SecurityServer[83]: token in reader ACS ACR122U PICC Interface cannot be used (error 229) 09/06/15 14:13:01,249 com.apple.SecurityServer[83]: reader ACS ACR122U PICC Interface: state changed 32 -&gt; 18 /code/pre  How can I solve this issue? Do you know what is the codeerror 229/code and why it's triggered?  <answer194395> I found a solution: You need to download the ACS ACR122U Drivers for Mac OS X 10.x.  Here the download page and the direct link for PC/SC Driver Installer 1.1.0 (Mac 10.5, Mac 10.6, Mac 10.7, Mac 10.8, Mac 10.9, Mac 10.10) (2014-09-17 306KB).  You have to install it even if the installer is not properly signed.  It will install the useful driver in: code/usr/libexec/SmartCardServices/drivers/ifd-acsccid.bundle/code  Now you are able to use the card reader. If you want to test it out, I made a simple project here.  <answer238940> The problem with the above answer is that it doesn't work with Mac OS X 10.11.x, as SIP (System Integrity Protection) mechanism blocks any attempts to write to system directories such as /usr/libexec/...  I found that the workaround proposed by Metsma here Re: el capitan 10.11.4 unable to see smartcard solved the problem of "interface or token cannot be used (error 229)" on 10.11.5. Also, once the right symlink was placed - I did not need to install any additional driver. The existing libccid.dylib.1.14.21 proved sufficient.  <comment227855> I'm getting the same error.

I'll keep you updated. <comment231779> hey, guys, did you manage to solve this? <comment232038> Solved, check the answer below.
