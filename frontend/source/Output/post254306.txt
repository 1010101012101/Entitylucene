Enabling word completion by ESC key <body> In Cocoa applications (for instance, TextEdit) there used to be a completion functionality by which, pressing the kbdesc/kbd, or kbd⌥/kbd+kbdesc/kbd (apparently, it depends on Mac OS X versions), a list of possible completions for the word being typed appears. In latest versions, up to El Capitan, it worked with just kbdesc/kbd; in macOS Sierra, apparently, it has been reverted to kbd⌥/kbd+kbdesc/kbd.  Although I know that someone didn't like the use of just ESC, I found it very handy. Is there a way to enable it?  I tried defining it in System Preference  Keyboard  Shortcuts  App Shortcuts, but it seems not to accept kbdesc/kbd alone as a shortcut.
