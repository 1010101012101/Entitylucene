Do pre-built Little Snitch configurations exist and are they shared? <body> Is it possible to import configurations that have been created elsewhere into Little Snitch? For example, a ready to go basic ruleset for someone who wants to block iCloud's more intrusive features. Is this possible? Do such communities exist that share these?  <answer248886> Yes, there are pre-built rule sets, and someone shares them.  I just stumbled upon this:  Little Snitch rules for blocking ad servers  Here they provide a list of pre-built rules for blocking ad-servers.  It is not related specifically to iCloud, but in general yes, there are shared sets of rules for Little Snitch.  <answer281584> This.  You can click the little question mark and know what it does.  Now can I have my bounty back?  <comment187599> Have you tried simply turning off iCloud? <comment189326> That is not the only reason why I am interested in preconfigured setups. <comment308898> Still actively updated by the looks of it. <comment310093> I think so too. However, right now I am using the list linked in my post and it is blocking "google.com" and youtube. It seems that both websites go straight to googleanalytics before loading. <comment353995> I need more than just the one site that blocks ads.   my browser handles that already and gets a pass from little snitch.  really looking for pre-built packages to handle all the OS stuff.
