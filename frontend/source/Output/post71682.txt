Thanks,  <answer71684> the default NTFS driver that comes with OS X is read only.  You will need to purchase a NTFS driver in order to write to the drive.  <answer71695> Try installing the latest release of OSXFUSE - check their wiki page for more information on using NTFS-3G.  <comment83251> I am not particularly interested in any file format I want to take back up from my two MacBooks and one Windows. When I buy this external disk, it says, format first to use it on mac. how I can use it for both? probably now, instead of re-format it again may be I will try to get NTFS driver for mac <comment83253> Use Fat32 instead of NTFS and both should be able to write to it.
