Always "Resolving host" on initial connection until Wifi restart <body> Lots of questions about "resolving host" but I can't find any that deal specifically with initial connections.  When I try to connect my Macbook (mid-2012 13 inch, Yosemite 10.10.3) to an already setup network for the first time of the day - e.g. when tethering to android or arriving at work - the browser belligerently sticks to "resolving host" until I switch wifi off and back on, despite ostensibly having a full connection wifi icon.  Then the connection is fine.  This happens pretty consistently.  Any idea why?  <answer188791> I think on the same line as ryebread: in SystemPreferences-Network-WiFi chosen at the left side-Advanced-DNS tab: put in 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4 with the plus sign then OK - Apply.  <comment223547> Do you have a custom DNS resolver address under the "Advanced" connection settings in `System Preferences  Network  WiFi  Advanced  DNS`? <comment223574> I'd be more inclined to hardcode the ISP's DNS than a 3rd party. I'd also check whether the rest of the DHCP was successfully set up at connect. If it's missing the DNS, that might not be all it's missing. Fault could likely be router's. <comment223580> Why is that?  Is that because of performance/security/privacy..? <comment223736> ISP DNS is usually faster than 3rd party, is all, just because it's nearer. More important is checking the DHCP is working properly
