GeekTool messes up formatting for cat <body> I have a text file called codestocks.txt/code it looks like this:  precodeAAPL    [1;37m  96.15[00m[32m      0.55     (0.58%)[00m GOOG    [1;37m 566.07[00m[31m     -5.53    (-0.97%)[00m FB      [1;37m  72.28[00m[31m     -0.37    (-0.51%)[00m MSFT    [1;37m  42.86[00m[31m      -0.3    (-0.70%)[00m /code/pre  The things that look like code[00m/code are colors of the text. When I use cat to read the file in Terminal it lines up and looks organized. When I try to do the same thing as a GeekTool shell command it messes up the spacing. What can I do to make it look right.

Switch to a fixed-width font in the Geeklet and you'll see the text aligned similar to how it is in the Terminal app.  Open the Geeklet editor and under the Style section press the codeClick here to set font &amp; color/code button.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wygaT.jpg" alt="Geeklet configuration"  If you like the way your content looks in the Terminal.app you can use the Monaco font for your Geeklet -- that's the same font Terminal.app uses. You see your Terminal.app font settings under codeTerminal &gt; Preferences.../code on the codeSettings/code tab.
