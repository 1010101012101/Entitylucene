How do you remove fonts from the Favorite collection in the Fonts dialog? <body> As titled. For example, if you bring up the Fonts dialog in Mail.app (kbd⌘/kbd-kbdT/kbd), and add a wrong font by accident to the Favorite collection (gear icon → Add to Favorites), how can you remove it?  <answer164604> Grab it in the list &amp; drag it out to the desktop - like you would with an app in the dock, etc.  You should see the little puff of smoke &amp; it's gone.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xHBd3.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment193034> do-e tashi mashite… or however you spell it [I'm really a Brit, but got the nickname when I worked in Japan, 20 years ago ;-) <comment193043> I imagine you'd want to write "dou itashimashite" with the i :) [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/どういたしまして](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/どういたしまして)
