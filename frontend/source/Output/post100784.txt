Very strange partition table: Missing a sector between Main and Recovery partition <body> So I have been trying to get Windows 7 on my machine using no DVD or USB (I have only an ISO to work with). I used various combinations of Boot Camp, Toast Titanium, Virtualbox / VMWare, Disk Utility, and rEFIt to attempt this, and after realizing that nothing had worked and getting a DVD-RW, I set about putting everything back to normal, i.e:  ul liChanging my MBR table back to a single EFI protective partition spanning the entire disk (apparently, Boot Camp magically did that for me)/li liMaking my OS X partition fill my whole disk again (in the EFI table, using Disk Utility)./li /ul  So now everything looks pretty much fine from the outside, but there's on detail that bothers me a little bit. Here's the output from codediskutil list/code:  precode/dev/disk0    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.1 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI                         209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            499.2 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s4 /code/pre  As you can see, I have no codedisk0s3/code partition. My Recovery HD partition should be in codedisk0s3/code and I should have no codedisk0s4/code. But I have no idea how this came about or how severe it is, and only the faintest idea how to fix it (deleting, making a new Recovery HD, not sure if that'll work)  As well, here is the output from rEFIt's Partition Inspector:  precode*** Report for internal hard disk ***  Current GPT partition table:  #      Start LBA      End LBA  Type  1             40       409639  EFI System (FAT)  2         409640    975503591  Mac OS X HFS+  3      975503592    976773127  Mac OS X Boot  Current MBR partition table:  # A    Start LBA      End LBA  Type  1              1    976773167  ee  EFI Protective  MBR contents:  Boot Code: Unknown, but bootable  Partition at LBA 40:  Boot Code: None (Non-system disk message)  File System: FAT32  Listed in GPT as partition 1, type EFI System (FAT)  Partition at LBA 409640:  Boot Code: None  File System: HFS Extended (HFS+)  Listed in GPT as partition 2, type Mac OS X HFS+  Partition at LBA 975503592:  Boot Code: None  File System: HFS Extended (HFS+)  Listed in GPT as partition 3, type Mac OS X Boot /code/pre  Which confirms that my MBR table is in the right place, and also tells me that my codedisk0s2/code and codedisk0s4/code are indeed right next to each other, so there is no invisible partition in between.  Thanks for your help!
