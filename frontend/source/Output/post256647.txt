Calendar Crashes While Opening - NSPersistentStoreCoordinator has no persistent stores or NSInternalInconsistencyException <body> The calendar crashes after 1s while opening. I already opened the temp dir codeopen $TMPDIR../codedeleted the cache codeC/code folder, restarted the computer and deleted the trash. This was not successful. Even after the upgrade to sierra the calendar is still broken.  I created a guest user account, where I'm able to open the calendar. But I cannot open it on my main (admin) account.  I tried to open the calendar after I had booted from safe mode. I also tried to open the calendar in safe mode, which was also not possible. The error is the same.  h2main error/h2  precodeThis NSPersistentStoreCoordinator has no persistent stores (unknown).

Saw in some other forums that it was linked to gmail calendar accounts.  Assuming you have a gmail calendar account linked, try disabling the gmail account from Settings and then opening calendar.  Once open you can re-enable the gmail calendar and it works fine (at least for me it does).  Not a solution to the problem, but a temporary fix to allow you to use calendar until Apple figures this out.    <answer266388> After upgrading to 10.12 a few days ago, Calendar (and Contacts, Mail, and Messages) wouldn't open for me either, but for another reason:  precodeAddressBookSourceSync: Could not get real path for Address Book lock folder: open() for F_GETPATH failed.

But where else can I disable the google calendar ( i cannot open the calendar app)? On my Iphone the calendar works fine but does not show any google calendars. <comment329854> I also opened this page: https://calendar.google.com/calendar/syncselect and unselected all checkboxes (besides the email, this one I cannot change).
