which preferences are synced to iCloud? <body> Had to replace work Mac after graphics card died, now I'm having to set up all my preferences like touchpad, and wifi hotspots. If I set up iCloud credentials will it sync these preferences across devices? (obviously some things make less sense like monitor resolution). Which preferences does it sync? if any?  <comment322417> Take a look at [this question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/225534/88313) that I found doing a search.  See if it helps. <comment322418> Short answer, no.
