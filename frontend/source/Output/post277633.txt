Unable to use Keynote's motion blur on Macbooks? <body> I was interested in making use of Keynote's motion blur option, but when I go into the settings, it's greyed out. It can't be enabled at all.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UjEBb.png" alt="Keynote settings does not allow motion blur to be enabled."  I'm on an early 2015 Macbook Air. I've come across a few places where someone with a Mac laptop noted that the option didn't work for them (like here and here), which seems to imply that it's not possible for it to work on any Macbook family hardware (or that there is some sort of hardware requirement in place). But I don't seem to see this specified anywhere officially or said a whole lot by users, so I'm wondering if there really is some hardware-related scenario or if it's some sort of different situation altogether.  Because if it's something else, maybe there might just be something I can do to get motion blur enabled.
