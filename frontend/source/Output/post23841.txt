Details of the proxy address which is being used by Mac <body> Is it possible to get the proxy address that my system is currently using in order to populate strongHTTP_PROXY/strong variable from command line ?  I would like a command so that I could set it in my em.bashrc/em file.  complete solution for me was to update my strongem.bashrc/em/strong file with this   precodefunction http_proxy {      export http_proxy=`networksetup -getwebproxy Wi-Fi  | head -3 | tail -2  | cut -f2 -d' ' | sed 'N;s/\n/:/'|grep -v ':0'` } alias homen="networksetup -setwebproxy Wi-Fi '' ;http_proxy" alias ofcn="networksetup -setwebproxy Wi-Fi proxy.examp.com 8080;http_proxy" http_proxy /code/pre  <answer23860> Either get ProxyConf, which does exactly this.  Or retrieve the web proxy with codenetworksetup -getwebproxy Ethernet/code (replace strongEthernet/strong with the one you're using from codenetworksetup -listallnetworkservices/code), then format the output into HTTP_PROXY format:  precode$ networksetup -getwebproxy Ethernet | awk '/Server:/ {host=$2} /Port: / {port=$2} END { printf "http://%s:%s", host, port}' http://127.0.0.1:8228 /code/pre  If your network services (Ethernet, Wifi, etc.) vary or you use multiple at the same time, you may need to get a little more elaborate to figure out which one is being used. codeman networksetup/code and codeman ifconfig/code should have everything you need if you want to go there.  Formerly there was also codescselect/code, but codenetworksetup/code incorporates all of it's functionality.  <comment26737> Updated question with the approach I took. Thanks Ingmar !
