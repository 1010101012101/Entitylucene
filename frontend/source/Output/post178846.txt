MacBook Pro battery percentage jumping down and up <body> Recently, my 2011 MacBook Pro 13' produces strange instantaneous jumps in battery percentage. Sometimes, when it is discharging, it drops by ~40% (and if it was near or at less then 40%, it shuts down unexpectedly), sometimes (both when discharging or charging) it suddenly increases by 40%.  The output of coconutBattery shows that the maximum charge is at the half of the design capacity when the 40% is "missing":  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JGjKR.png" alt="coconutBattery output"  Then the maximum charge seems to go back to normal:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/huTeF.png" alt="coconutBattery output normal"  System Report says:  precodeBattery Information:    Model Information:   Serial Number:    W00030C0L77ZC   Manufacturer: SMP   Device Name:  bq20z451   Pack Lot Code:    0   PCB Lot Code: 0   Firmware Version: 3   Hardware Revision:    2   Cell Revision:    100   Charge Information:   Charge Remaining (mAh):   2979   Fully Charged:    Yes   Charging: No   Full Charge Capacity (mAh):   2979   Health Information:   Cycle Count:  86   Condition:    Normal   Battery Installed:    Yes   Amperage (mA):    0   Voltage (mV): 12471  System Power Settings:    AC Power:   System Sleep Timer (Minutes): 10   Disk Sleep Timer (Minutes):   10   Display Sleep Timer (Minutes):    180   Wake on AC Change:    No   Wake on Clamshell Open:   Yes   Wake on LAN:  Yes   Current Power Source: Yes   Display Sleep Uses Dim:   Yes   PrioritizeNetworkReachabilityOverSleep:   0   Standby Delay:    4200   Standby Enabled:  0   Battery Power:   System Sleep Timer (Minutes): 10   Disk Sleep Timer (Minutes):   10   Display Sleep Timer (Minutes):    15   Wake on AC Change:    No   Wake on Clamshell Open:   Yes   Display Sleep Uses Dim:   Yes   Reduce Brightness:    Yes   Standby Delay:    4200   Standby Enabled:  0  Hardware Configuration:    UPS Installed:    No  AC Charger Information:    Connected:    Yes   ID:   0x0100   Wattage (W):  60   Revision: 0x0000   Family:   0x00ba   Serial Number:    0x002b46f4   Charging: No /code/pre  Should I suspect hardware failure, or is there something I might try to fix this erratic behavior?  <answer178859> I do not know if your CoconutBattery is doing that but the numbers do not make sense at all.   Can you look under About this Mac - More Info - System report - Power and get the battery numbers from there.   What you showing here is a old battery, that has already seen over half of its life but it shows only 86 load cycles--- which is not possible/correct.  In your case emresetting the SMC/em might solve the problem.  Here is how to:  Intel-based Macs: Resetting the System Management Controller (SMC)  <comment211929> The battery was manufactured long ago but I bought it last August so the loadcycle count is realistic. I updated my question with some information. I'll try to reset the SMC... <comment211995> Thank you, the SMC reset seems to have solved the problem! <comment212005> Thanks, that would explain the numbers :)
