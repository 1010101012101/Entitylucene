How to find which ports depends on a given one when using macports? <body> I want to find which ports depends on a given installed port (codetexlive/code in my case). I found codeport deps texlive/code, but this is working in the "wrong" direction. How can I do it?  <answer38221> Use codeport dependents &lt;portname&gt;/code. From codeman port/code:     codedependents/codebr          Lists the installed ports that depend on the port emportname/em.   There is no way to search for emall/em ports (including those not installed) depending on a certain port.  <answer71374> precodeport echo dependentof:texlive /code/pre  I believe that this will only show you a list of port installed on your machine that depend on the port.
