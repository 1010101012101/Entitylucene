Bulk remove provisioning profiles on iPhone <body> Over time I've accumulated many (valid) provisioning profiles on my device, and now have  over 400 in Settings. The only way I know of removing them is going into each one individually.  Is there an easy way to remove many of them at a time?   <answer125561> Turns out that using the Organizer in Xcode allows you to do this.  <answer170322> Unfortunately you can’t batch delete them in Xcode 6 anymore. You can use Mac Auto Mouse Click to setup two steps that click on the minus sign then click on the last provisioning profile by defining X and Y coordinates. Set a high repeat count and all your provisioning profiles will disappear automatically.  Here is another option (that I haven’t tested) suggested by Filippo Bigarella using libimobiledevice:     for uuid in codeideviceprovision list | tail -n+2 | awk '{print $1}'/code; do ideviceprovision remove $uuid; done    You can use homebrew to install libimobiledevice if you don't want to build it from source.  <answer221970> Apple Configurator 2 can be used to remove a batch of provisioning profiles.  <comment266007> It is ultra slow. Not only you can't select more than one provisioning profile at a time, it takes several seconds to delete the currently selected one and become responsive again after you hit "delete". I mistakenly set the "Team" in my target and now I have all 100+ provisioning profiles installed. All apps take forever to launch. The only easy way out is to restore to factory settings. <comment275192> Sir, you win the internets for this weekend. It took about 45 minutes to remove 400+ profiles but at least it is automated. Seems to delete at a rate of one a second. It was taking me 10-15 seconds for any non Apple app to load previously, now they are all loading instant.
