Open a program in finder with only keyboard <body> If I navigate to a program in my Applications folder in Finder and press enter the program offers to be renamed. Only a double-click with the mouse opens the app.  How can I open it with only the keyboard?  <answer263286> You can use kbdcmd/kbd+kbdO/kbd or kbdcmd/kbd+kbdâ†“/kbd to open apps from the keyboard.   Other way is to use Spotlight kbdcmd/kbd+kbdspace/kbd and type the app name, then hit enter.
