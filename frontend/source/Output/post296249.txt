Converting Word Table to iPhone <body> I have a my contact list on my PC, formatted as a table in Word (.doc). Is there a convenient way to transfer this info into my iPhone 7+ contact list other than manual data entry?  <answer296290> One solution is to import the contacts stored in the Word table into the macOS Contacts Application. These are the steps to get your Word table over to Contacts:  ol liCopy the whole word table into the clipboard (cmd-C)/li liPaste what you’ve copied into a new excel spreadsheet (cmd-V)/li liSave the Excel sheet into a CSV file (comma-separated values/li liOpen the macOS Contacts application and select File  Import (cmd-O)/li liA dialog appears in which you can specify how the import file components will be assigned to the Contacts fields. Click Ok when you’re done to start the import process./li /ol  Once the contacts live inside the Contacts app you can easily synchronise them onto the iPhone using iCloud or iTunes.  Hope this helps.
