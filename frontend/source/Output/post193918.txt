Copying data from unbootable mac <body> Two days ago I turned on my Mac to find out that it doesn't boot anymore. I tried everything, safe boot, pram reset, repair disk from recovery mode everything but no lick so I finally decided to reinstall Yosemite. But before that I want to copy some files from the hard disk. So what should I do?  <answer193942> Assuming you do not have a current Time Machine Backup then...  If you can boot to the strongRecovery HD/strong, then attach an external USB/FireWire/Thunderbolt drive (whichever works for you since you didn't state what Mac you have, and boot to strongRecovery HD/strong and then use strongDisk Utility/strong to make a strongDisk Image/strong of your strongHome Folder/strong to the external drive.  Or a Disk Image of whatever Folders you want to save.  In strongDisk Utility/strong click, strongFile  New  Disk Image from Folder.../strong  In the strongSelect Folder to Image/strong dialog box navigate to the target location, e.g. code/Macintosh HD/Users/$USER/code and select the strongFolder/strong, then click the strongImage/strong button.  In the strongNew Image from Folder/strong dialog box, name the image and then navigate to the external target location to be saved and then click the strongSave/strong button.  In this example, you now have a disk image of your Home folder on an external drive and can copy your User Data back from that image after you clean install the OS.  <comment231222> Reinstalling Yosemite doesn't wipe your drive, unless you meant you're planning to format the drive first. <comment231227> I'm going to do a clean install
