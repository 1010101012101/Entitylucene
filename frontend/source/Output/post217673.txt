Headless Mac mini: Share Screen + FileVault <body> At the office we have a Mac mini that will be used to run a Teamcity agent. It is a requirement from our security department that we enable FileVault on this machine.  I will also need to manage remotely (via Screen Sharing) this Mac mini from my laptop. I don't want to have to plug in a monitor + mouse + keyboard to manage the build agent.  On this Mac mini, we have 2 accounts: 1 admin account, and 1 teamcity account (standard user). Since the plist file that will run the agent is located in code/Users/teamcity/Library/LauchAgents/code, I currently need to log in (via the login screen) as teamcity for the agent to start.  My problem is that after I restart the Mac mini, I can't "Share Screen" with the Mac mini.  The only solution around this that I found is to manually log in (from the login screen) to the teamcity account. Of course, I don't want to have to plug in a keyboard + monitor to start the agent.  My question is: how can I remotely "Share Screen" to a FileVault-enabled Mac, if the target user (teamcity) is not logged in?  <answer217687> You will need to attach actual hardware to login on a Mac with FileVault encryption enabled. You can not set the machine to automatically login (see Apple Support)  The machine requires that you enter the password very early in the boot process, I believe before it mounts the hard drive, so you can not use Remote Desktop or Screen Sharing to login.  <answer217698> Other answers here are correct - it is not possible to remotely access a freshly-booted Mac with FileVault enabled without physical access (FileVault operates 1 layer closer to actual software than a 'traditional' BIOS or firmware password).  It is, however, possible to remotely reboot a Mac and force it to allow remote access even with FileVault enabled, provided you issue the correct command:  precodesudo fdesetup authrestart /code/pre  Apple calls this 'Authenticated Restart' official semi-documentation is available here, with a more in-depth view from C|Net gives a high-level description of its workings.  Note that if a Mac is not restarted with this command (a regular restart, powerloss, or otherwise), physical access will be needed to access the Mac. The command also (obviously) requires admin privileges to run.  <comment263150> Being that it's a standard account, could you just set the TeamCity account to auto-log in on boot? Screen sharing from the log in window requires additional software, in my experience. <comment263152> Unfortunately automatic login is not possible when FileVault is enabled: https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT201476 <comment263154> Right you are. Typical Monday. <comment263157> Will you be using Apple hardware, or do you need a cross-platform solution for the Mac? <comment263160> In any case: https://support.apple.com/kb/PH18686?locale=en_US <comment263172> We all use Macbook laptops at the office, so in theory I could use a "OS X-only" solution. <comment263176> On re-reading your question, my case of the Mondays was more severe than I imagined. There's a relatively simple solution I put in an answer.
