Travel with my MacBook Air <body> Can I bring my MacBook Air that I purchased here in the Philippines to Singapore without any problems in the airport? We will have a vacation there next week and will be staying for 4 days.  <answer266346> You can fly with your Airbook without any problem to any place in the world as long as you carry your original invoice/receed with you during the trip. You need to prove to the customs officers that you bought your MacBook in your origin country before the trip.   In some Airports are also custom offices where you can register your Notebook etc. before the flight and you get a special document from them which proves you had the Notebook before the flight. I made this many times in Sao Paulo, Brasil for example. This counts for anything you want from Notebook to Mobile Phones etc. how ever in this case you need to bring as well your receed/invoice to prove you did buy it actually in this country.  This Rule applies for any country as far as I know.  <comment333967> This question would be a better fit on [Travel.SE] <comment333975> I travel extensively with a MBP.  I have _never_ had to prove where it was purchased.  Then again, I've never had any of my belongings searched on arrival.
