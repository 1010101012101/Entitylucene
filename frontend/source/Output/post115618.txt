how to add button to Finder toolbar to call python script with current folder as argument? <body> Recently I added context menu under services to execute python script but I think it would be convenient if  I add a button on the Finder toolbar, like next to New Folder Button in below image.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3wGEx.png" alt="enter image description here"  Is this possible at add button on Finder Toolbar that triggers a python script and passes the current folder as argument  ?  <answer115645> See if this works.  Download the strongGet first Finder Window Path BETA 10.9/strong automator action from from my blog : my_very_first_automator_action   The action returns the path of the front most finder window. It does not take any input from above actions. The post explains it all :-)  Create a new Application document in Automator and add the strongGet first Finder Window Path/strong to it. Then just add you Run shell script after it.  Save as Application. And then do the drag and drop.  I would test it with your code but I do not have the python slideshow...  hr  Note from Apple documentation in regard to Third party Actions.     Installing Actions When your action has been thoroughly debugged and   tested, build a deployment version of the bundle (using the proper   optimizations). Then create an installation package for the action (or   add the action to your application’s installation package). The   installer should copy the action to /Library/Automator or   ~/Library/Automator, depending on whether access to the action should   be system wide or restricted to the installing user.      Instead of installing your action separately, you can put it inside   the bundle of your application, especially if the action uses the   features of that application. When Automator searches for actions to   display, it looks inside registered applications as well in the   standard Automator directories. The advantage of packaging your   actions inside an application is that you don’t need to create a   separate installation package to install the actions. To install the   actions, users need only drag the application to a standard location.      Action bundles should be stored inside the application wrapper at   Contents/Library/Automator. Thus, if your action is MyAction.action   and your application is MyApp.app, the path inside the application   would be:  precodeMyApp.app/Contents/Library/Automator/MyAction.action /code/pre      You can either manually copy an action into this location (after   creating the necessary subdirectories) or you have Xcode copy it using   a Copy Files build phase. If you copy an action into an application   bundle but the application is already installed on a system, you must   get Launch Services to recognize that the application has new content   to register (that is, the new action) by changing the application’s   modification date. You can do this by entering the touch command in   the Terminal application.  precodesudo touch /Applications/MyApp.app /code/pre      Or you can rename the application in Finder to something else, change   it back to the original name, and then launch the application once.   <comment135302> This is most likely possible by making the same service which I assume you did in Automator into a app and then holding the `option`+ `command` keys and drag the app on to a finder window tool bar. Might be worth showing what you have in the service <comment135313> @markhunte : ok then how to make the service as an app ? <comment135316> To answer that properly you need to show us your workflow  using scene shots and code snippets in your Question. <comment135318> here is the workflow with the screenshot: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/115371/how-to-capture-folder-as-input-and-pass-it-to-python-script-as-argument <comment135326> well the link you gave isn't working: Hmm, www.markosx.com isn't loading right now. <comment135332> Hmm. I out at the mo. But the link loads on my iPhone? <comment135356> yes this does solves what I was looking for, and I can do the same way for my slideShow to open. but the path that I specify in Automator  Run Shell Script is going to be different for every user, which means I would have to some how insert the install path in the Run Shell Script for the app to work with anyone. Do u have slightest idea how to do that or do I need to create another question on apple.stackexchange ? <comment135367> Glad that worked. I think it would need to be a new question. Giving details of why the path for each user will be different and what you need.. You know the drill:-) <comment135372> I've added a note regarding third party action which you may need to know in regards of distributing a application that uses a third party action. <comment135373> Hey @markhunte I asked a question separately [here][1]  [1]http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/115690/how-to-pack-python-package-that-includes-python-scripts-and-bash-scripts-for-osx
