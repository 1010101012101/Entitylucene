What is raid-ac protocol on port 2012 <body> Yesterday I made OS X Server, on Mac Mini, for Xcode Continuous Integration.br Today, by scanning my local network, I see that this Mac Mini is having port 2012 open with this raid-ac.     I googled but can not find any info regarding this raid-ac.br I suppose that this raid-ac is used for this Xcode Continuous Integration feature.  Can somebody provide more info about it ?  <answer126994> As far I know strongRAID/strong, it's a way to store data across multiple disks (HDD) acting like one.  There are multiple standard levels of them as explained on this Wiki (might be emgeeky/em as you say).  Based on that knowledge I would say the services works with redundancy in order to run smoothly. As you say yourself: Continuous Integration (as in, without interruption) br /  Please check source below:      UDP port 2012 uses the Datagram Protocol [red. that's what UDP means], a communications protocol   for the Internet network layer, transport layer, and session layer.   This protocol when used over PORT 2012 makes possible the transmission   of a datagram message from one computer to an application running in   another computer. Like TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), UDP is   used with IP (the Internet Protocol) but unlike TCP on Port 2012, UDP   Port 2012 is connectionless and does not guarantee reliable   communication; it’s up to the application that received the message on   Port 2012 to process any errors and verify correct delivery.   source   <comment148734> It's the protocol linked to that port : ftp://www.ietf.org/iana/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.txt <comment148735> Is there some explanation for not hard-core geeks ? :-) <comment148740> You're only making suppositions right ? References would be great to support your answer. <comment148742> @MatthieuRiegler I was, until my edit looking for references or information. TBH, it's amazingly hard to find. <comment148743> I am familiar with RAID, but I doubt that raid-ac have anything with RAID. I do not see the connection. Maybe this raid-ac is used for https://developer.apple.com/bonjour/ ? <comment148744> @Rob by this I meant on the name of the protocol <comment148745> @Rob The info and link you’ve added in your edit say nothing particular about port 2012 or raid-ac, just generalities about UDP. <comment148746> +1. I also did an intensive research and find nothing but standard generated text like your edit. That's really strange. <comment148747> I start to wonder if Area51 is involved @MatthieuRiegler ;)
