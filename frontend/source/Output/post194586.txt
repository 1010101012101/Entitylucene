copy folders to user library using Terminal on OS X <body> I would like to copy a folder to the user library using the OS X Terminal. The command line I use is codecp -r/code. The problem is that the command runs, but it doesn't copy the folder and it returns no error.  Exist a special command for copying folders to user library?  Thanks a lot.  <answer194589> You are almost there. codecp/code with the code-R/code option and the arguments codeSOURCE DESTINATION/code  precode    cp -R /absolute/path/to/source/folder $HOME/Library /code/pre  Replace code/absolute/path....../folder/code with the real absolute path to the folder you wish to copy  <comment232146> Can you add the full command line you are using? <comment232156> Why can't I use a POSIX path for the library path? <comment232169> `$HOME/Library` is the POSIX path to the Library folder. `$HOME` expands to `/Users/YOURNAME/`. If you want to type the absolute path to the destination directory then do so.
