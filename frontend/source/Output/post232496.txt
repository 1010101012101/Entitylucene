Locked Apple ID <body> I just updated to IOS 9.3 and I accidentaly locked my Apple ID while logging in. I forgot the yahoo email in order to reset it. I don't know any of my security questions (because I'm an idiot and I don't write them down).   <answer232498> With sufficient proof of ownership you can take your phone to the Genius Bar at an Apple Store and have them unlock it.   Make sure to make an appointment.   I think they can unlock it over the phone but it requires emailing your proof which can slow down the process.
