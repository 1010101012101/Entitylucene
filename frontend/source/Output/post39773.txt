How to adjust Smart Playlists so they work better on iOS device with iTunes Match <body> I have a smart playlist that has all songs with a play count over 20 that haven't been played in the last 6 months.  On a computer, the playlist is set to limit it to 25 songs, selected by random.  On my iPad, with iTunes Match turned on, the playlist has 800 songs on it. Is there a way to tweak the playlist so that it works better on iOS?  ul liMatch all of the following rules/li liPlays is greater than 20/li liLast Skipped is not in the last 1 months/li liLast Played is not in the last 6 months/li liKind does not contain Video/li liLimit to 25 items selected by random/li liMatch only checked items/li liLive updating/li /ul  Thanks.
