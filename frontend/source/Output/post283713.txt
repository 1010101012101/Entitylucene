iphone ios hotspot irregularities <body> Why is it so difficult to have my iphone 6 hotspot wifi show up on the list of networks on my various apple devices.  Does not matter which client device (iphone, ipads, macbook pro).  I ALWAYS have to stop and restart my hotspot in order for it to be seen with my devices.  It alway works, but stop and restarting hotspot every time I walk away from my mac is a bit of a pain. This has been this way on prior hardware / software versions from iphone 4 to my current iphone 6 with updated IOS.  Anyone else see this behavior?  Is it fixable or should I just live with it.
