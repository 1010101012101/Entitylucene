How can I write an AppleScript which when run will connect to a specific WIFI network if available? <body> The title pretty much sums it up. I want to avoid having to use the trackpad to connect to certain networks. This comes up often when a new network becomes available but I'm already connected to another one.  <answer105771> One way to do this to use the terminal command:   precodenetworksetup -setairportnetwork "en1" "name" "password" /code/pre  from a script. Here's a simple Python script that will do this:  precode#!/usr/bin/env python  import subprocess # display current network  subprocess.call(["networksetup", "-getairportnetwork", "en1"]) # switch to new  subprocess.call(["networksetup", "-setairportnetwork", "en1", "Airport2", "topsecret"]) /code/pre  and this runs fine from inside Keyboard Maestro or TextExpander after you define a single keystroke to run it.  You can run these commands from AppleScript instead - I just get tired of trying to guess the right syntax for everything...  <answer105795> You can also use ControlPlane:  ol liEnable "Nearby WiFi Network" from the Evidence Sources tab./li liAdd a nearby WiFi network rule from the Rules tab./li liAdd a Network Location or Run Shell Script action from the Actions tab./li /ol
