OS X: Route audio output to audio input <body> I'm watching a video file, and I'd like to record small snippets of audio from the video file.  Previously I have played the audio on my MacBook speakers and used the built-in microphone to record the sound.  Is there a way to route the Mac's audio output to the audio input (microphone) digitally, so I don't have to actually record the audio from the speakers, with the loss of quality this incurs?  Is there also a way to listen to the audio at the same time it's "recording"?  Ideally, the solution would be easy and light-weight and not involve heavy use of audio software, because I want to be able to do it "on the fly" as much as possible.  <answer222402> h2Update 2017-03-31:/h2  Rogue Amoeba, the previous maintainers of the open source Soundflower project, has a new (paid) application called Loopback which seems to be easier and more dependable to work with than Soundflower. It solves some issues with Soundflower, like reenabling volume up/down via the Mac media keys. Again, it is a paid product with a trial mode. https://rogueamoeba.com/loopback/  Soundflower can still be found here: https://github.com/mattingalls/Soundflower  hr  Soundflower is a virtual audio device for OS X that can pass audio from applications to other applications. It does this by routing your audio output as an audio input to the system.  h2Step 1/h2  After installation, a new device will be available in emSystem Preferences  Sound/em. Go to the emInput/em tab and select emSoundflower (2ch)/em as the input device.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/E0hOG.png" alt="Audio Input Tab"  h2Step 2/h2  If you want to route the audio strongemand hear it yourself at the same time, skip to Step 3./em/strong  If you're okay with strongemnot having to hear the output yourself/em/strong, you can now go to the emOutput/em tab and select emSoundflower (2ch)/em. You are now routing your Output to Input, and will be able to record the audio playing to an application like QuickTime, Evernote or Just Play Record.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7ZNTp.png" alt="enter image description here"  h2Step 3/h2  If you want to hear the audio while it's playing on your normal Output device (e.g. your Built-in speakers or attached headphones), you need to open the native OS X application codeAudio Midi Setup/code. It's located in your Applications folder under code/Applications/Utilities/code.  Press the code+/code button in the bottom left corner, and press codeCreate Multi-Output Device/code. Mark to use both your Built-in Output and Soundflower (2ch). Now you can hear audio as usual while routing the Output into your Input via Soundflower.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aWgzt.png" alt="enter image description here"  Now that you have created a Multi-Output Device, go back to emSystem Preferences  Sound/em and select it on the emOutput/em tab as in Step 2.  strongemTip/em/strong: You can also change the Input/Output settings by holding kbd‚å•/kbd (codealt/opt/code) and left-clicking the Volume icon in the OS X menu bar.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MDZXG.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  h2Troubleshooting/h2  strongHOWEVER/strong, while the above emwill work/em at times, I have noticed that the behaviour of Soundflower can be erratic from time to time. When originally composing this answer, I couldn't get it to work even though I hadn't modified the setup that was working the day before.  It has stopped working a few times before, and while I haven't exactly identified how to mitigate the issue, I have noticed that something of the following may have helped to get it working again:  ul liCheck if the emvolume has been reset/em for the Multi-Output Device emor/em any of it's sub-devices in codeAudio Midi Setup/code. Be sure to check all tabs (Input/Output) on both the aggregated Output device and and its aggregated sub-devices. There's quite a few tabs here, and the volume sliders on one of them may have been reset to zero. This has happened to me a few times./li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/43wa9.png" alt="enter image description here"  ul liVolume resetting to zero wouldn't have to be a big problem, emif/em the normal volume controls (media keys and menu bar volume icon) worked as usual. But sometimes, the volume icon in the menu bar is grayed out and the volume can only be manipulated in codeAudio Midi Setup/code. I don't know why this sometimes happens, because when I use some other Multi-Output Devices I have created that also includes my other computer connected via Thunderbolt in Target Display Mode, I can magically use the volume media keys as normal. More experimentation is needed here./li /ul  <comment268878> See my answer on http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/203004/nice-audio-mixer-repeater/203009#203009 If you wanted to attempt to use Soundflower, I copied a tutorial in the answer to this one - http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/207482/quicktime-for-osx-10-9-5-has-no-sound/207484#207484 <comment268892> Soundflower allows cross connecting inputs and outputs internally but if I remember right when I used it with screen recording software to record video it shunts all the audio so you can no longer hear the video as it plays. <comment268898> @ArchonOSX I've tested Soundflower now and it works good. I also managed to do screen capture with QuickTime player and still had audio output. It might be a good idea to set up a Multi-Output in the OS application Audio MIDI Setup. <comment268901> Ahh good deal. If I have occasion to use that again I will look for those options. Thanks for the tip. <comment269476> @Tetsujin I have added an answer based out of your solution. However, I'm having difficulties getting Soundflower to work consistently. Sometimes it just stops working, and I don't know why. See more below. <comment269477> Have you tried the [Soundflower v2 beta](https://github.com/mattingalls/Soundflower/releases)? I actually stopped using it around Mavericks as it got too unstable - even causing kernel panics - & now have Audio Hijack so no longer need it. My 'pro' routing is usually ASIO/Rewire anyway, so I don't really want to risk Soundflower again just to test. <comment269478> @Tetsujin Yep, the v2 beta is the version I'm using. I may have to get `Audio Hijack` instead if it's reliable, because I've already wasted much time trying to get Soundflower to cooperate. <comment269479> it's 50 bucks for a one-trick pony, but it does that trick pretty well. The demo has , iirc, a 30-day full-spec trial, so you could try it out first. <comment269503> Soundflower is great. I've used it extensively, in the past. Plays nicely with DAW software. (i.e. Ableton, ProTools, etc). <comment301199> I was able to get Shazam to recognize songs I listen to on the headphones. It was a little confusing to set up, but it was primarily all set up in Audio MIDI setup and to use SoundFlower for both input (microphone) and output (speaker with waves) for Shazam to work correctly. SoundFlower is working better for than Loopback. I was detecting phasing on my headphones with Loopback. SoundFlower is working well even on 10.10.5 of Mac OS X.
