Waking closed lid macbooks using wireless <body> We have carts of Mackbooks and Macbooks pro that students use and close the lid and put them back in cart when they are done.  They use wireless networking and don't have USB or displays connected.  I am wondering if there is any way we can wake the macbook remotely using wireless (WoWLAN?).  We don't want to have the setting where macbook doesn't sleep when lid is closed.  Is there any way we can wake them on and have them connect to our wireless when their lid is closed?  The remote management software we use couldn't work when they are in the cart overnight.  <answer140638> No - the only way to wake a Mac when the lid is shut is to connect a USB keyboard and display as described in closed clamshell mode for the specific models of MacBook you have.  ul lihttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT3131 - Learn how to use an external display with your Mac notebook while the notebook display is closed/li /ul  Unless your MDM provider somehow modifies the OS to get it to connect during power nap (highly unlikely), then you will need to perform management before they are put in the cart or after they are taken out of the cart.  <answer276910> Apple now says yes: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204032     codeIf your Mac supports Power Nap, these activities can occur while your Mac is asleep:/codebr   [...]br   codeMobile Device Management can remotely lock and wipe your Mac./code       codeAnd these activities can occur while your Mac is asleep and plugged in to an AC power outlet:/code  precodeSoftware updates download.

Our main goal is to remote into macbooks while they are closed in their cart.  We can change the setting where it doesn't go to sleep with lid closed but that would be a very bad solution and would decrease their lifetime.  There should be a way where we can wake them up using wifi.  Send a wake on wlan packet, wake them up, run maintenance tools remotely and shut them down.  IS it possible?
