An iOS app for JIRA that works <body> I am a Jira superuser, my company runs Jira and I am looking for a way to use it on the go. Unfortunately, none of the mobile Jira app I have been using seems to work with our setup.  Does anyone have recommendations?  <answer33958> At present, the best mobile app for JIRA may well be Mobile Safari. Have you tried installing Atlassian's JIRA iPhone Web Interface plug-in?  strongEDIT (based on subsequent comments):/strongbr It seems like you've tried most of the available apps. The only one I haven't tried is Undock - it's $5, but it supports Gemini, Basecamp, and Bugzilla as well as JIRA. Has great reviews, so it might be worth a shot.   Failing that, they do have the JIRA plug-in source code on Bitbucket. Updating it to JIRA 5 would be pretty difficult but I bet updating from 4.2.4 to 4.3 would not be too bad.  <answer70976> Here is nice free one officially from Atlassian: JIRA Real Life  It allows you to quickly add issues on the go with voice notes, photos. Handy to add issues, but I guess it is not for browsing through existing issues.    <answer111570> You can try also JIRA.me application. We have released it 2 months ago (Pro version) and just recently we've published a Free, read-only version (you can buy Pro upgrade later) that allows you to get what the application is like.  A quick summary of current functionality:  ul lipre-defined and user defined (through Web interface) filters available,/li liinline actions like assign directly from issues list, or issue details/li liediting an issue,/li lisearching for issues/li lisupports Confluence Wiki markup language/li /ul  <answer136112> Check out our new iOS JIRA App: Chronoscope for JIRA  Some of the features included are:  ul litrack your working time with the included stopwatch (chronoscope)/li liwork on multiple JIRA systems simultaneously/li librowse the cockpit for a very fast access to your tasks/li liget an overview of all your work logs/li lisearch for specific issues/li /ul  Soon we are going to release a new version with a timesheet (looks like a calendar with all your worklogs).  <answer204485> JIRA Board offers a nice, native way to visualize your kanban &amp; scrum boards  https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/jira-board-kanban-scrum-agile/id934196108?mt=8  <answer244913> Free iOS app for JIRA was released in March and there are a lots of features coming on mobile.Here is the link to official JIRA app, JIRA Mobile  <answer276150> Easy Jira is an iPhone app designed as an alternative to Atlassian's mobile client. Just as Atlassian's "JIRA Cloud" it is simple to use, but has some unique differences:  ul liThe app works with self-hosted JIRA servers/li liThere is no "your session timed out" problem. App simply logs you in automatically. The auto-login can be secured by fingerprint verification if needed/li liCaching mechanism inside the app allows you to access tasks while offline (in read-only mode)/li liUnlike all other iPhone clients, the app allows you to attach any possible files to JIRA (not only images and videos)/li /ul  The app is designed to work with custom workflows. If you find any problems with your JIRA workflow - write me (I'm the developer of this app) and I will try to make respective corrections in the engine.  The file uploading functionality is paid, but the rest 99% of the app is free to use.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wg1DE.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  http://easyjira.in.ua  <comment38664> Which apps have you tried already? <comment38667> I think Jira Anywhere Jira Touch Bugbox  none of them were working on our Jira 4 <comment38765> Can you provide more detail on what features you need it to provide? <comment38937> I will try asap! Thx. <comment38938> Update tickets assigned to me mostly. <comment38939> Unfortunately this is not compatible with our version of Jira (4.3) :-( <comment38945> Well, it seems like you've tried most of the apps.

Updating it to JIRA 5 would be pretty difficult but I bet updating from 4.2.4 to 4.3 would not be too bad. <comment38950> Thanks a lot for the help. Undock seems like working... I think it handles well SSL (which was one of my issues) however it seems very very slow and I have a lot of "Network Problems" messages. I'll try it more to see if it can be usable.
