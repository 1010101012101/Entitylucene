How to turn on email notifications when Find My iPhone is used? <body> I actually liked getting email notifications when Find My iPhone was used and all of the sudden they stopped. I can't find any options to turn them back on. Anyone know why they stopped or how to get them back?  <answer196438> You can't turn off email notifications, so they are being sent, but not being delivered. Check that the email address is correct and the emails are not being delivered to your spam folder.
