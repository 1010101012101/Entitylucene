Internet not working on iPad mini with iOS 7 <body> Since a couple of days internet connected applications (such as facebook) have stopped working on my wife's iPad mini which has iOS 7.1.2.  Further symptoms:  ul liinternet works in Safari/li liinternet doesn't work in Facebook (though it works with the messenger component), the app store, Dropbox/li litrying to install updates fails (seems to time out, doesn't even start downloading)/li litried to sign out from the Apple account (Settings - iTunes &amp; App store) and sign back in, however it won't let me sign in (tried multiple times and confirmed that the account details are correct by signing in on a PC)/li litried rebooting multiple times to no avail/li /ul  Any ideas what could be done? I will try to connect it to a PC having iTunes later to see if can help - also will try to update it to iOS 8.4 (hopefully it's possible to do so without being signed in to the apple account).  <answer198353> I solved it - turns out the problem was a flaky internet connection! The clue was that I was unable to sign in to iTunes on my Windows laptop (the connection was timing out), even though I could do the same on my Linux laptop.  I rebooted the router and then was able to sign in to the iCloud account from the iPad and everything started working. I also updated it to iOS 8.4 just in case :-)  <comment237073> Did you try rebooting the device? (Hold the power button, slide, wait, hold the button again, look at the Apple logo, and then try again?) <comment237090> @DDPWNAGE - yes, I did that multiple times to no avail :-( <comment237098> What are you using for Internet? Wi-Fi or cellular data? If you're using Wi-Fi, try switching to a cellular connection. <comment237194> @DDPWNAGE - WiFi - the particular model doesn't have cellular data.
