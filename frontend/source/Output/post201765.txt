How can I use a TP-LINK TL-WN722N WiFi adapter in Yosemite? <body> I'm aware that there is no OSX driver provided by TP-LINK for the TL-WN722N, but if I'm referring to this question, some people had success with other devices in the same situation.  Is there any way to use this adapter in Yosemite ? Any workaround or hack ?  [EDIT : OSX updated to "El Capitan" : still no driver...]  <comment243254> Try going with the last OS-X driver available. While somewhat different that a WiFi adapter, I had the same issue with a printer recently, so I downloaded the Snow Leopard driver for the printer and Yosemite then recognized the printer and everything worked fine. <comment244593> Thanks for your answer. Unfortunately, no OS-X driver was ever released by TP-LINK for this product even for "old" versions of OS-X.
