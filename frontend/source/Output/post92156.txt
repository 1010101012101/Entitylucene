Install a new color profile on Mac OS 10.8 <body> I have a IIYama screen that curerntly display garbages (very, very poor quality).   On the IIYama website, I found drivers for my screen (ProLite B2409HDS), it contains the following files:  ul li2409hds.cat/li li2409HDS.icm/li li2409HDS.inf/li /ul  And some other files for Windows 7.  But my issue is, on my Display preferences, I can't see any button to add a new profile using my codeicm/code file :  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rK1S0.png" alt="enter image description here"  If I click on kbdOpen profile/kbd, I get a codeColorSync/code profile that looks like when I open the given code2409HDS.icm/code file manually, so I think there is a way to add it... But can't find it!  Any suggestion ?  <answer92158> I finally found how to add profile: put the codeicm/code file on that directory:  precodeMacintosh HD\Library\ColorSync\Profiles /code/pre  And you'll see your profile here....  Anyway, this did not solved my issue, it looks like Apple really want us to buy their incredibly expensive screens. I surely regrets paying 30 boxes to upgrade to 10.8.  <comment108202> Care to elaborate on what problem you're having with the display? Take a photo of it. <comment126844> Well, I have an ASUS and it displays correctly...
