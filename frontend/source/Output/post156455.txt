Define additional shortkey with the same effect like RETURN in Safari.app <body> I'm working with MacOS X 10.6.  I'd like to define a keyboard shortcut codeCtrl-m/code, which does the same thing like codeRETURN/code does, without deactivating codeRETURN/code.  How can I do that in codeMacOS X 10.6/code. In the keyboard control panel, I can only assign menu commands to shortcuts, but RETURN is not a menu command, but a key that does different things in different locations.  How can I do that?  hr  emRemark:/em  ul liI would prefer a built-in or at least free solution. I'm using Quicksilver already, so if it would be able to define such a key/trigger, that would also be helpful./li liemIf you wonder, why I want to do it, you'll find the explanation here: https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/3544/is-there-a-more-convenient-key-binding-for-return/em/li /ul  <answer156457> You could do it using Keyboard Maestro.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/s5UcF.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer156650> It might be possible using Quicksilver to run an AppleScript that “types” Return, but that will probably be unreliable in some contexts.  A much more straightforward solution that doesn’t require any third-party tools is to just use the built-in key bindings system.  Add this to code~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict/code:  precode{     "^m" = "insertNewline:"; } /code/pre  Things to be aware of:  ol liThat file doesn’t exist by default.

Well, I'd like to avoid paying 42$ just for changing a few keybindings, which (I'd assume) should also be possible with some "hacking", shouldn't it? Anyway, are you sure `Keyboard Maestro` would be able to create such a shortkey which has the same effect like RETURN in Safari? <comment183946> Pretty sure. I posted an answer with an image of a macro that do it. <comment184216> Hi Rob! Thanks a lot! AppleScripts are relatively slow from my experience, so I'd prefer the key-binding solution. Thanks a lot for the very useful hint on "proper Cocoa apps"!! Question: how can I find out, if an application is "proper Cocoa"? <comment184217> p.s. is there a way to find out, if that key-binding (e. g. `^m` is already used/defined in other applications? <comment184416> I don’t know of a sure-fire way to tell if something is Cocoa other than checking with the developer. Inconsistent appearance is the biggest clue.  As for figuring out where it’s used, you’ll just have to look around at the menus or try pressing it in different apps to see what happens. I would hope that a standard on like ⌃M isn’t used anywhere (unless it’s already used as Return).
