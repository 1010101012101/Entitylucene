Backup Time capsule content for later restore <body> I am selling my Time Capsule. I would like to back up its contents so that when I get a new one later, I can restore its contents back. There is a documented way to backup and restore to a new time capsule if you have both the old and new devices available.   How can I backup the contents to a hard drive strongso that I can restore it later to a new Time Capsule/strong? Can I just copy the contents?  <answer220558> ol liInstall the replacement back up device first./li liLet the replacement drive finish at least one complete back up./li liSecure shred the data on the old one./li /ol
