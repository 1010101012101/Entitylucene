Where is the AirPlay menu bar app? <body> Apple hardware requirements state that AirPlay is not supported on my 2010 Macbook pro.  However, I can use AirPlay to stream music/movies from iTunes to my Apple TV (4th gen), as well as YouTube videos on Safari.  So why can't I get a menu bar app? AirPlay clearly is supported.  <answer227404> AirPlay is supported, extending or mirroring your Mac's desktop over AirPlay is emnot/em supported. As far as I know, the only way to stream from the menu bar is to stream system audio by Option-clicking the sound/volume icon. i think video streaming is still per-app if you can't do AirPlay desktop mirroring/extending.   <comment276184> Forgot about mirroring, thanks!
