Randomize ical event start times <body> I have an event in ical that recurs every day.  I would like to randomize the start time of this event (which schedules an applescript) so that the start times are random but within 30 min of each other.  I've done google and duckduck searches for:  ul lirandomize ical event start time; /li lirandomize ical events by 5 minutes,/li /ul  and have gotten nothing relevant.  I've had a look at the applescript dictionary for iCal but cannot find a useful function.  I don't need the whole script just a hint in the right direction or a function that I could use to create the events instead of modifying them all by hand.  <answer120008> I found the answer googling for codeapplescript make start time random/code.  I used the following code from this apple support community thread:  precodetell application "TextEdit" launch repeat delay (random number from 2 to 8) set textToType to "text" &amp; some item of {"hello", "goodbye"} &amp; text end repeat end tell /code/pre  hr  and for text:  precodesome item of {"blue", "red"} /code/pre  hr  Here is the final script that worked for me:  precodetell application "iCal"      set myCal to "Scheduled tasks"     activate     set allEvents to every event in calendar myCal     repeat with anEvent in allEvents         set modTime to (random number from 0 to 30)         display dialog modTime with title start date of anEvent as text         set newStartTime to (start date of anEvent) + modTime * minutes         set start date of anEvent to newStartTime         set (end date of anEvent) to ((end date of anEvent) + modTime * minutes)     end repeat end tell /code/pre
