I want all applications show their title bar, how do I achieve this? <body> I do not want the titlebar to disappear. Is there a solution to have it always visible? Here is the opposite wish:  Is there a way to hide the title bar of applications?  Anyone using TinkerTool? Does it achieve what I want?  <answer225345> Don't use Fullscreen. Maximise instead.br  Opt/click the green dot, top left, instead of just clicking it.   Or double-click the title bar.   <comment273438> Makes no difference on latest El Capitan. The bar disappears. <comment273440> Then you're doing something wrong... I loathe Fullscreen so that's how I always do it. <comment273442> D'oh, sorry... Opt/click, not Cmd... Or double-click the title bar. Updating answer...
