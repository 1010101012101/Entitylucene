Apple Music loved songs <body> I tried to create a smart playlist with "Loved" criteria = true, but this smart playlist will only include the loved songs from my library.   ol liIs there a way to include also the loved songs from Apple Music that are not in my library?/li liIs there any other way to collect all the loved songs from all my devices into one playlist/album/whatever?/li /ol  I don't know why Apple makes this so complicated?!  <answer244229> There is no way to achieve the Loved smart playlist without adding the song first to your library from my testing.  I have just given a song emLove/em on Apple Music and it did not appear in my smart playlist until I added it to my library. Even if it was added to a playlist but not actually to My Music it would not appear.  <answer244233> ol liNo/li liNo/li /ol  Apple Music—for some unexplainable reason—does not enable you to make a playlist of your loved songs. It's a questionable omission, and an easy one to avoid for them, but no, you can not set up a playlist of only loved songs. Instead, just add them to a playlist manually.  <comment300950> You can make a smart playlist of Loved songs, they just have to be added to your Library. <comment303242> Simply stupid if you ask me... So many songs, such a poor UI and poor discovery/playlist options. <comment303310> @PrimozRome https://spotify.com <comment303311> @PrimozRome https://play.google.com/music <comment303373> @JohnRamos Spotify does not work in my country <comment303374> @JohnRamos have all my offline music in iTunes and I would not like to use google play. I also don't like google knowing everything about me so I would prefer Apple fixes Apple Music
