I added my username to /etc/sudoers but using sudo still asks for password <body> I entered my username in the sudoers file, but when using sudo in scritps, it still asks for the password.  This is my sudoers file:    precode~: ls -al /etc/sudoers -r--r-----  1 root  wheel  1297 Aug 14 11:44 /etc/sudoers   /code/pre  Contents:    precode... %admin  ALL=(ALL) ALL petruza ALL=(ALL) ALL /code/pre  (http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=F38RxeYP) (I also tried with %petruza but didn't work either)  I have a script to start XAMPP, but it asks for the password anyway:  precodesudo /Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/xampp start /code/pre  <answer142013> Please realize that disabling the password prompt for codesudo/code is a huge security concern.   However, it is possible. Instead of what you already have, add this to your code/etc/sudoers/code file:  codepetruza ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL/code  Here is some more reading on this topic.  <comment167436> Thanks, I can see this is a security threat, but there's actually no sensible information of which security I should care about. <comment167441> You should care because, without a password prompt for `sudo`, a utility can run as a privileged user without you allowing it to or even without you knowing. I think a better option is to use `sudo -v`, which will cache your credentials and extend the `sudo` timeout by 5 minutes. This way, you will be prompted less often but not sacrifice a great deal of security.
