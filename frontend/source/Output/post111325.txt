Is there is a way to send a local message from a Mac to an iOS device *without* the Internet? <body> I know I can send Prowl notifications from OS X to iOS, but that requires going over the Internet.  I'd like to accomplish the same thing, except that I want to be able to be able to do it emwithout/em an Internet connection, to be able to send a message from a Mac to (an) iOS device(s) on the same LAN/Wi-Fi network.   em(It doesn't have to be with Prowl, it could be with any iOS app, as long as it can receive a message from OS X.)/em  <answer111342> It is definitely possible to write an iOS/Mac OS application pair that would allow communication between the Mac and the iPhone using Bonjour on a local Wi-Fi network. Or using Bluetooth.  Though these might already exist, I'm not aware of any soft that does the trick.  <answer111352> If I understand you correctly you're asking how to push local notifications on your Mac to your iOS device (hence using Prowl as an example)? Well since Mavericks/iOS 7 if both your Mac and iOS device support Bluetooth Low Energy, you could use a service based on the Apple Notification  Center Service. This feature is also covered in this 9to5mac article.  <comment131001> So - the OS X machine & the iOS device would be in the vicinity of each other? <comment131013> @Scot - Oh, yesâ€¦ I was assuming that they were on the same Wi-Fi/LAN, but realize that I didn't actually put it in the question. I have edited it to add that detail. Thanks for the question. <comment131422> That might work, but my Mac doesn't do BT Low Energy.
