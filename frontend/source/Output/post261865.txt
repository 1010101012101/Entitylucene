How do I remove 'Network' from my drives on macOS Sierra? <body> I simply want to remove the "Network" icon from the main finder window of my computer drives.  I just want to see the 3 hard drives - MacSSD, Storage and TimeMachine.  Tried everything I can think of to get rid of it, I suspect it needs some kind of expert terminal command!  Any help very much appreciated :)   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tO0up.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment327964> It may help us if you can tell us what you're trying to achieve, or why you want to hide it. <comment327968> Not sure knowing why I want to hide it will help?  If so, I would love to hear how!!  It's quite clear from what I've written in the main question what I am looking to achieve. <comment328103> For example: Do you want to disable access to network browsing entirely, or just literally the icon in that one view? Here's a tip: When somebody wants to help you and tells you how *you* can help *them* help *you*, you could maybe not second guess it. <comment328140> I simply want to remove the "Network" icon samh.   Oh and I pasted that from the original question..
