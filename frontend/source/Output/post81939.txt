I want to remove an entry in my $PATH <body> I'm running OS 10.8. When I  precodeecho $PATH /code/pre  my terminal outputs  precode/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/opt/X11/bin:/usr/local/git/bin:/usr/texbin:/Users/austinzuffi/Development/Android/adt-bundle-max-x86_64/sdk/tools /code/pre  and i want to remove or at least edit  precode/Users/austinzuffi/Development/Android/adt-bundle-max-x86_64/sdk/tools /code/pre  I can't find out where that string is entered. My /etc/paths shows  precode/usr/bin /bin /usr/sbin /sbin /usr/local/bin /code/pre  I'm assuming there's a file such as .bashrc that adds the entry upon login. I just can't find out which file is doing it. If you know which files might append my path environment variable, please let me know so I can check!  Also, if eclipse is modifying the system variable, let me know. I'm assuming eclipse doesn't have that power however I'm new to it.  Thanks guys -Austin  <answer81941> You can take a look at this Superuser article for information about OS X path stuff. Of particular interest are the files in code/etc/paths.d//code and code~/.bash_profile/code and the like.  <answer82344> Look in code~/.profile/code, code~/.bashrc/code, code~/.bash_profile/code, code/etc/bashrc/code for a line of the following form:  precodeexport PATH=$PATH:/Users/austinzuffi/Development/Android/adt-bundle-max-x86_64/sdk/tools /code/pre  Also look to see if any of those files contain a line starting with either codesource/code or code./code (which is short for codesource/code). If they do then look in the sourced files too.  A quicker way might be to use codegrep/code. Open a terminal and, from your home directory run   precodegrep -r "/Users/austinzuffi/Development/Android/adt-bundle-max-x86_64/sdk/tools" .  /code/pre  <comment94520> Look in `~/.profile`, `~/.bashrc`, `~/.bash_profile`, `/etc/bashrc`. If any of those files contain a line starting with either `source` or `.` (which is short for source) then look in the sourced files too. Quicker might be to use `grep`. Open a terminal and, from your home directory run `grep -r "/Users/austinzuffi/Development/Android/adt-bundle-max-x86_64/sdk/tools" .`. <comment94966> @CraftyThumber This should be an answer, and not just a comment. <comment95014> @MarkThalman OK, thanks, I put it as an answer. <comment191844> `grep` a quicker way?! If you really don't know where it could be, this approach will take a **lot** of time. Do you know how long it takes grep to search through a 500GB hard drive? Long. In terms of certainty `grep` is the best choice, but not speed. <comment191845> And HDs are bigger these days ;)
