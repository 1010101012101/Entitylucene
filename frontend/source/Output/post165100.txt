How to read iPhone system logs? <body> Does the iphone (and ipod/pad?) have an equivalent to the Windows Event Log? How can one read it?  I'd like to examine the event log for things like unlock events (successful and failed), charging times (connect/disconnect), network access (connect/disconnect) for both wifi and data, and power cycles (on/off). Bonus points for what apps run and when. All going back several weeks (if possible).  I want to check existing history, not install something on the device that will track this kind of information going forward. I would also prefer not to install something in order to get historical logs, but will do so if that's the only route forward. I don't have a Mac, but do have Windows 7 (and Linux if need be).  The devices are not jailbroken and running iOS 8.   <answer165133> This can only be done on a mac:  ul liConnect your device to a Mac/li liOpen Xcode, go to Window-Devices in the title bar/li liClick on your device from the sidebar/li liClick 'View Device Logs'/li /ul  You don't need to be enrolled in a developer program to be able to do this. To this on windows you'll probably need some sort of virtual machine/hackintosh  <answer242934> There are multiple ways to access them. If you wish to do so from the device, you will need to (re-)compile some developer tools/tool-chains for the ARM CPU and load them onto the idevice. If you wish to do so from the computer (either Mac or Windows), there are apps for doing so that you would need to install. The only other option I would suggest would be becoming and XCode/App developer. More on these options can be found here:  "The iPhone Wiki - Accessing iOS System Logs"  <comment193655> You can't unless you have enrolled in the iOS developer program. Even enrolled, you only have access to certain kind of logs (energy, networking...).
