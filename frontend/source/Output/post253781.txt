Unable to connect Time Machine to WD MyCloud EX2 on Sierra <body> I updated to Sierra yesterday and now my Time Machine backups to my WD MyCloud EX2 NAS aren't working any more. Scheduled backups get stuck in "Looking for backup disk..." in Time Machine preferences. Does anyone have ideas on how to resolve this?  Here is what I did to troubleshoot:  ol liI am able to access the backup drive over the web interface http://wdmycloudex2.local/ and that page mentions my firmware is up to date and both the drives are healthy. I can also connect to smb://wdmycloudex2.local and afp://wdmycloudex2.local from Go  Connect to Server in Finder./li liI went in Time Machine preferences and turned it all off.  /li liRebooted WD NAS Confirmed power-on test passed by going back to http://wdmycloudex2.local//li liWent back in Time Machine preferences and tried to add the drive back./li /ol  Time Machine fails with this error when I try to add the drive back: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TSlse.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bLyvR.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer253809> Please try to connect to your disk using afp://yourserver.local  If it shows up in your Finder (CMD+K) you should be able to mount it in time machine.  <comment316017> Smb isn't supported for time machine. It never was, and could only be hacked to force it to work in some cases. <comment316165> Yep, this works. Thanks for the tip. Seems like it's an issue with the MyCloud - https://community.wd.com/t/macos-10-12-sierra-time-machine-backup-fails-with-osstatus-error-65-on-a-my-cloud-device-answer-id-14921/179010/2 <comment316186> @ZachRattner Great, I'm glad this solved your issue!
