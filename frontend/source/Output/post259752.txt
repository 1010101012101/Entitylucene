Setting up python3.5 with tesseract <body> I was trying to use google's tesseract from within python, but seems I'm missing something in the installation process. At first, I followed that tutorial for setting up the environment, but the python (I'm using 3.5 version installed with homebrew) didn't see the tesseract module, nor cv. Then I tried to follow this guide to install opencv2, but still no luck with importing cv module. For the tesseract wrapper part for python, I did try to install with pip3 the following: pytessert, pytesseract, tesseract-ocr; but couldn't import tesseract module.  Any help would be really appreciated.  <comment326907> Please include the error output from python or pip. <comment327257> @HaraldNordgren There is no error has been given. I just can't manage to import `tesseract` module. If you have done it on OSX, could you provide a step by step guide from scratch?
