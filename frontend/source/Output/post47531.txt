iTunes Home Sharing on Apple TV drops after a few minutes on Belkin N750 <body> Just bought an Apple TV and connected to my TV and all looks good. I'm having an issue with Home Sharing, however. The library is found, I play something from the library, it plays for about three minutes, then drops. I then cannot find the library in the "Computers" section of Apple TV. If I then quit iTunes and start it again, it shows up again on the Apple TV and I can start again only to be dropped three minutes later. I have seen some posts blaming the router not supporting Bonjour. I am on the phone now with Belkin.  Using: Apple TV connected via HDMI to a Panasonic LED TV, streaming from a MacBook Air 2010  I really think this is a Home Sharing issue.  <answer47744> Working with Belkin we found an update to the Belkin router that fixed the issue. You may want to update if you are not up to date, version: 1.00.49. The standard update check in the router settings did NOT find this update.   en-us-support.belkin.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5359  <comment54463> Belkin found an update to the belkin router that fixed my issue.
