Insert accented letters in passwords <body> This should be easy, but I cannot solve it by myself.  How can I insert strongaccented letters in passwords/strong?  When I go to codeSystem Preferences &gt; Security &amp; Privacy &gt; Change Password.../code and in the password field for instance I stronghold the letter/strong codeu/code, it won't show the list of possible accented letters, it just repeats the codeu/code.   If I use codeAlt+u/code to get the placeholder for codeü/code (so that I can type codeu/code to get it with the umlaut), it won't show the "insert a letter now" yellow placeholder, instead I get a beep. The same goes for codeAlt+i/code, codeAlt+n/code, codeAlt+e/code, only beeps and no possibility to enter an accented letter.  Moreover, if I enable the "emShow emoji and symbols/em" as in the picture below, I am able to insert symbols strongin the hint/strong, but in the password it is strongcompletely prohibited/strong.   The same goes with "emShow keyboard viewer/em" and try to insert with codeAlt+e|u|i|n/code to be able to finally enter codeeuin/code to get the symbols éüîñ, I get a beep. The only accent that emsort of works/em is the backtick codeAlt+backtick/code, but strongit inserts the backtick itself/strong without prompting for the letter to be accented.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gEo8C.png" alt="Emoji and symbols palette"  Input source: US Englishbr OS X version: El Capitan 10.11.3 (15D21)  Is there a way?  PS. By the way, when changing passwords, can I tell my Mac to strongstop/strong asking this? "emWould you like to change the password for “username”, or begin using your iCloud password to log in and unlock this Mac?/em"  <answer227777> Entering a password with a diacritic works as expected. You have to use the proper keys though:  To enter an umlaut you have to use kbdalt/kbdkbdU/kbdbr To enter an accent grave you have to use kbdalt/kbdkbd`/kbdbr To enter an accent acute you have to use kbdalt/kbdkbdE/kbdbr To enter an accent circumflex you have to use kbdalt/kbdkbdI/kbdbr To enter a tilde you have to use kbdalt/kbdkbdN/kbd    The above are all dead keys and have to be followed by a second key. If you enter kbdspace/kbd the diacritic itself is the "entered sign". Entering a dead key in a password field you neither get the typical yellow/orange dead key indicator nor a bullet - you get a beep only!  The back tick itself is no accent (dead key) but simply a back tick.  E.g. to enter an strongü/strong using an US English input source and an Apple keyboard with a (physical) US English layout you first have to hit kbdalt/kbdkbdU/kbd and then kbdU/kbd again.  In my virtual machine I get an alert sound but no bullet after entering the first key combination (the dead key code¨/code) and then after entering the second (single) strongU/strong a new bullet. The resulting letter is the (lower caps) strongü/strong.  hr  BTW the code¨/code is no accent. Like accents it's a diacritic though.  <answer227897> Perhaps not a fully security bullet proof solution but definitely the simplest and quickest one.  ol liOpen any location where you can type in normal text/li liType your password including the special characters/li liSelect password, Cmd-C for copy/li liGo to the password dialog, Cmd-V for paste/li /ol  If you want to do this in the login window, you could do the same however there are few extra steps to be taken:  ol liSystem Preferences / Users &amp; Groups / Login Options/li liDisplay login window as: Name and password/li liLog out/li /ol  Now you have 2 textboxes; one for the login name, one for the password.  You can now use the same trick as the one I described above.  Small issue though; the system doesn't show the clickable accent-options assist box though.  They do work however.  (for example try pressing 'e' for 2 seconds, then press '2' and the é should show up in the textbox)   <comment277596> Please remove your P.S. and add a second question. StackExchange works best if you ask one question per question...! <comment277604> My input source is US English. <comment277621> I am using El Capitan, version 10.11.3 (15D21). Unfortunately I don't have an older version to test... <comment277631> Why do you consider the ¨ umlaut to not be an "accent"? <comment277637> @TomGewecke In linguistics only some diacritics are considered accents: `´ ˆ. They mark either a special syllable or vowel length, pitch or amplitude. The umlaut marks a completely different vowel. <comment277644> Thanks for the explanation.  Apple is sloppy I guess, considering all diacritics to be accents. <comment277646> @TomGewecke The colloquial use or the meaning of "accents" is probably different than the scientific. But at least in the German-speaking world nobody would call the two dots "accents". Accents here are always straight or angular but they aren't dots or double-dots. The truth is: I don't even know the name (except Umlautzeichen) of the two dots in German. The diacritic ¨ itself is called trema or diæresis. <comment277664> Apple uses sloppy German too it seems:  https://support.apple.com/de-de/HT201586 <comment277666> @TomGewecke Maybe 2 % of the Hermans know what a diacritic is and less than 0.5 % heard of trema/diæresis. One have to be generous even with Apple ;-) <comment277723> When inserting a umlaut with `Alt+u` **in the password**, I get a beep and no bullet, with the accent `Alt+backtick` the backtick gets a bullet ignoring the accent wish, with `Alt+e` I get a beep and no bullet, with `Alt+i` again a beep and no bullet. So is it **impossible** to get an accent/umlaut in a password? <comment277755> Updated answer. Entering Alt+e|u|i|n|` is not sufficient to enter an accented character! <comment277764> Yes, I know, I am sorry I didn't explain it clearly. I hope now it's clear that I want to enter `ü`, using `Alt+u` and then `u`. Thanks for pointing that out! :) <comment277767> You won't get the yellow/orange dead key sign entering a key in password fields. Instead you get a beep. **But** after entering a proper letter afterwards you will get the accented character finally. Try it with a second user. <comment277773> Note that due to possible differing encodings, using characters beyond the ASCII range (and that includes all letters with modifiers/diacritics, and a lot of special characters) may lead to issues when logging in through other means than your Mac's login prompt, including network shares, screen sharing, etc. Use at your own risk! <comment277780> Might it be that this is why OSX inhibits those? It's for me unorthodox, but I can understand that. <comment277787> But I couldn't log into my computer with this hack, I think. <comment277789> Answer edited with a solution for that.  I do admit it isn't a quick & simple method anymore.
