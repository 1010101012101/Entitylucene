plutil returns error when a string numeric key is used <body> I'm trying to insert a row to a plist by using the following command  codeplutil -insert "160" -string "hi" file.plist/code  However the system was not so happy about the fact that I was using a numeric key (even in string format.) This command should be correct because I tried other things like  codeplutil -insert "thisistext" -string "hi" file.plist/code  and it worked.  Is there any way I can use string numbers as keys? Xcode can do the job, but I need to get it done in terminal.  <comment254670> duplicate: http://stackoverflow.com/q/33137270/7552
