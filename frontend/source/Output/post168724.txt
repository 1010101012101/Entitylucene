trying to install a new graphics cards in mac pro tower 5,1 <body> nvidia GEFORCE GTX 750ti stuck at black screen tried installing custom nvidia driver, no dice any suggestions?  running mavericks but trying yosemite because nvidia has newer yosemite drivers   trying this as well sudo nvram boot-args="nvda_drv=1" but i'm not sure if that command is only for hackintoshes or not (i don't have a hackintosh)  <comment198058> how long should i wait at the black screen of nothing before trying something else? i put the new card where the old card was.. can i install both cards (the old one kind of words) and go from there? <comment198063> what does your console says in windowserver? and what does the ColorSync utility says? <comment198064> can you clarify a bit?  i can't boot into osx with the card installed but i could look in the console to see if there was something from before... <comment198065> "Failed to look up the port for "com.apple.windowserver.active" <comment198118> did you try resetting the SMC? [shut down, remove mains, wait 15s, plug back in, wait 5s, power up] With an unflashed NVidia, you'll get black screen until the desktop appears, btw. <comment198334> tried that but no dice however upgrading to yosemite and installing the latest nvidia drivers did the trick for me.
