iPad Air won't play videos after update <body> I've already closed out all apps running. I've already reset with the power and home button. All videos played before this last update. Now nothing!!!  <comment316785> You need to provide more details so the community can help you. For starters, what update are you referring to? Have you updated an app? Are you talking about updating to iOS 10? Also, what app(s) are you trying to play videos with? And, when you say videos, do you mean videos you've taken? YouTube? iTunes movies? Embedded videos on websites?
