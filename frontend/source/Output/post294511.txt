Macbook Pro (late 2011 15") is stuck in a boot loop <body> It boots up until the progress bar is at about 80%, then it flashes to n empty grey screen, no login window shown, no apple logo. 30 seconds later it reboots on its own.   Things I tried:  ul lireset the PRAM/NVRAM/li lireset SMC /li libootet with D and shift: no indication of any kind of different boot, same as normal boot/li libootet with cmd+R: it doesn't boot to the recovery window, but switches to "Internet recovery". Internet recovery runs to 100% before switching to the grey screen/li liran Apple Hardware test (quick and extended): no failures/li litried to boot from an "Install Sierra" usb pendrive: it recognizes the pendrive, but boots with the same behavior as a normal boot/li libooted to single user mode: I can boot to single user mode and run fsck on the different partitions. I cannot repair user permissions (thanks, apple, for removing that funktionality). /li libooted with a live linux usb stick: it works, although I have to enter the boot option "nodmraid". However, I cannot start Xorg. I can ssh into the Macbook when booting with linux. I also ran testdisk and recovered (at least I think so) the partition table. Both, the normal Mac partition, as well as the recovery partition are there. /li libooting to verbose mode. /li /ul  Some errors occur:  precodetask_exceeded_footprint: failed to warn the current task... /code/pre  hr  precodeAppleKeyStore: operation failed (pid: 45 sel: 7 ret: e00002c2.... /code/pre  hr  precodeconfigureInterests - nElements &lt;= 0!Failed to configure interests I080211Controller:addSubscriptionForThisReporterFetchedOnTimer() Failed to addSubcription   I080211InterfaceMonitor::configureSubscriptions() failed to add subscription /code/pre  and it finally stops at  precodeIOConsoleusers: gIOScreenLockState 3, hs 0, bs 0, now 0, sm 0x0 /code/pre  Any help is appreciated. Does this mean it has a dead GPU? I just found out that Apple's repair program ended in December 2016...   <answer294516> You can try this:br 1. Remove hard drive.br 2. Backup all data from it (external case will help) to another computer.br 3. Format your HD.br 4. Try to install and boot a fresh (factory like) MacOS.br PS: it is also an option to install a HD from a working MacBook, if you have access to one.   If that fails, you definitely have a hardware problem.   <answer294521> You model is known to have a faulty video logic board, and Apple even has a repair program for them.  Before going the Apple Store route, you can try one more thing, which , if it fails, proves that there is something gravely wrong with the hardware (something you probably already suspect). You can connect a FireWire/Thunderbolt cable between yours and a working Mac, and use Target Boot mode to see if it boots properly. You can find more detailed instructions here but it pretty much entails booting your MacBook while pressing the 'T' key.  <comment371737> I am unsure whether or not step 4 will work... how can I install Mac OS without a physical medium to boot from? <comment371738> This question is very alike. Try contacting and probably your situation will appear the same, sadly though. https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/273598/macbook-pro-2011-shows-grey-screen-during-boot?rq=1 <comment371739> Here you will need a second computer another time to make a flash drive with a MacOS distributive. There are many articles on how to make one. <comment371742> I made a flash drive with sierra from another mac. It isn't booting up... <comment371743> unfortunately, the repair program ended 8 months ago for my model... <comment371746> Then it's hardware and most likely GPU, though the exact diagnosis you will hear only after bringing your Mac to a service.
