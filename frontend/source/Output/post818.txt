Is there an OS X dashboard widget for notes from the iPhone Notes app?  <body> I'm looking for a Dashboard widget for OS X that allows you to read and edit emnotes/emâ€”the pieces of text in strongiPhone Notes application/strong and strongMail.app/strong. (I.e., something analogous to the To Do Widget which shows the same To Do items that you can access through iCal.)  I don't use Mail.app regularly and would like some quicker way to access the notes synced from my iPhone.  Edit: To reiterate, this question is strongspecifically/strong about the notes in iPhone's Notes app (screenshot below) and in Mail.app. (And not e.g. about alternative notes apps for iPhone/OS X or iCal's To Do items.)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5OEWl.png" width="180"  <answer824> If you are looking for a way to sync and edit notes, then I suggest Simplenote. It isn't a Dashboard widget, but it's very lightweight and all of your notes are saved to a central server that all of your devices can see.  <answer917> AFAIR Organized does what you want (among other things).  <answer3475> I'm stuck with the same question but what I've managed to find is a useful widget for the mail.app and ical todo's. You can download it at http://todo.philipefatio.com/  <answer3482> This doesn't exactly answer my original question either (which is about an emOS X dashboard widget/em for accessing Notes), but it is the most useful note syncing solution I've found so far:   strongYou can now (with iOS 4) sync Notes over the air with any IMAP email account/strong. And MobileMe accounts too, as the relevant Apple support article points out: iPhone and iPod touch: Syncing Notes.  Specifically, you can easily sync Notes with your strongGmail/strong account. This blog post gives good instructions with screenshots.   img src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/_ZaGO7GjCqAI/TCDH7t1PWpI/AAAAAAAATKQ/vi2UclUXmvk/s640/iphone-notes-2.png" width="180"  Of course, in a way, a cloud-based approach like this is even better than having a widget on the emone/em Mac you sync your iPhone with. There's this drawback though:     The notes can only be edited from an   iPhone or iPod Touch    In other words, you can only emview/em them in Gmail.  <comment674> I asked about this ~year ago at [MacRumors](http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=725091) but have so far only got lots of "me, too!" answers and a couple of misunderstandings. <comment685> Not really an answer to the specific question I had, but thanks anyway, maybe I'll try it out sometime. <comment764> This looked promising; I downloaded it & tried it, but unfortunately it does not sync notes with Mail.app or iPhone Notes.   :/ There are notes yes (and the UI even looks like the iPhone Notes app), but they are not synced with anything. <comment818> Oh, you're right. It does sync To Dos and uses iCal etc., but it doesn't sync notes. Sorry. <comment3168> +1 on simplenote, this replaced using the built in notes for me. There is also a dashboard widget, and a great app called Notational Velocity will sync to give you even more power. <comment3169> If you read the question carefully, you'll notice I already mention that widget in the first paragraph. As you say, it's about To-do's, **not** Notes. <comment3181> I agree. If you don't use the Mail application anyway, why bother using the built-in note app on the iPhone? A combination of Simplenote and its dashboard widget or Notational Velocity will do exactly what you want, and give you more flexibility and power. <comment53029> You have already been very patient, so wait a few more months for Mountain Lion, and enjoy a genuine Notes Mac OS X App that syncs over iCloud and is editable from any location :) <comment53031> I agree on Simplenote and you can couple it with nvALT or Notational Velocity for a nice combination. That said, I've heard Mountain Lion will have this capability built in: the Notes app in iOS will sync with a notes app on the Mac.
