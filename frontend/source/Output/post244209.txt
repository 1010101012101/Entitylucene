Buzzing sound on Macbook Pro mid 2012 due to optical drive fixed? <body> Am aware of the fact, there is a known problem as mentioned in this Apple KB: Mac notebooks with optical drives: Noises from the optical drive link, that is produced when the OS is initializing the optical drive. It seems to be occurring in OS X Yosemite for now, but would like to know if there is any possible fixes for it in the same OS version or upgrading it to OS X El Capitan will fix the problem.  Mine is the MBP 2012(mid-version), with 8 GB RAM and 500 GB SATA HDD.  Any help regards to this appreciated!  <answer244440> This is most likely not even your optical drive, but the PSU fans! Just remove the superdrive bay and your problem is solved!  <answer244717> The sound is totally normal on older MacBook models and it's not a bug. It's from the optical drive looking for a boot up disk.   <comment301235> Appreciate your time! But can you provide some verifiable resources/links to back-up the answer? <comment301244> @Inian http://forums.macrumors.com/threads/mac-pro-buzzing-fan-and-hard-drive-noise.229710/ <comment301246> Am pretty sure this ain't the nature of the problem I am facing. I just have a small buzzing/whirling noise and I am sure it is from the optical drive which lasts only for about 2-3 seconds only during at restart or power-on and not any other time. Thanks for your time though. <comment301321> @Inian Uhh... if the noise is at startup then it is the sound of it turning on. You cannot get rid of it. <comment301611> How does it sound like? Like this? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0T60yZmiQw <comment301612> Not this persistent sound! it doesn't last more than 2-3 seconds along with original apple chime! <comment301613> Something like this? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIUVbq25uvY <comment301615> Bingo! exactly the same! I could see it being no harmful in comments of the video! did a search myself, couldn't find then. Thanks a lot. If you could post that as answer, I will handover the bounty to you :)
