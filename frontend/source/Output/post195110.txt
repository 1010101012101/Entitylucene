iPhoto does not recognise the photos on the SD card of my new camera. <body> I am running Lion on iMac and iPhoto is up to date.  my new camera is a sony a6000.  The photos show up in the import window, even with an image of the camera, but when I ask iPhoto to import them it comes up with a message saying Unreadable Files - file is in unrecognised format. The photos are RAW but I've never had a  problem importing RAW files before. This is what the file is displaying as in the unreadable files window. /Users/SueHewett/Pictures/iPhoto Library/Import/Masters/Roll 1/_DSC2044.ARW  <answer195127> According to Apple's RAW format support page, Sony Alpha ILCE-6000 support was added in Digital Camera RAW Compatibility Update 5.06 released in August 2014.  This update requires a minimum of OS X Mountain Lion 10.8.5 with iPhoto version 9.4.3 or later.    I recommend upgrading to the latest OS X version supported by your Mac.   <comment232917> Does the same thing occur in Image Capture? It is a separate app located in ~/Applications/Utilities/ <comment233135> Thanks, I'll look at upgrading - have been a bit reluctant to do that so far. <comment233136> Image Capture won't import them to iPhoto - it tries to, but iPhoto then has the same message.  Image Capture will import them to Pictures in Finder, but they're not much use to me there.  I think I need to upgrade the OS X.  Thanks.
