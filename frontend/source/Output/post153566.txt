Keyboard shortcut for switching between buttons in a dialog <body> I was wondering if there is a way, like using the kbdTab/kbd key, to switch with the keyboard between buttons on a dialog box, where a program asks for a decision? em(Example below)/em  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pqJbr.png" alt="Sample Screenshot"  <answer153579> kbdTab/kbd is supposed to work (and does), but Yosemite seems to have a bug in regard to highlighting which button is selected. The entire button being blue means the button is the default, but there should also be a visual indicator of which button is selected.  You can test that kbdTab/kbd does in fact work. Press kbdCmd/kbd+kbdS/kbd to save the page you are looking at right now. Then, in the Save sheet, press kbdShift/kbd+kbdTab/kbd twice, and press kbdSpacebar/kbd. The Save sheet will disappear because you selected the Cancel button and executed it (with the kbdSpacebar/kbd).  Because of the lack of a visual indicator, unfortunately this is going to be difficult to use until the visual bug is fixed.  <comment180775> I don't have a problem with the visual indicator in Yosemite, it works just fine for me. However, as detailed here: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/38015/how-can-i-switch-dialog-buttons-using-the-keyboard?rq=1 there is a setting that must be enabled to use the tab key to move between buttons.
