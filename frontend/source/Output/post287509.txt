What would randomly set my default gateway to 255.255.255.255 <body> Running OSX 10.12.5. When I came in this morning everything was fine, grabbed my usual address off of dhcp. Later started having internet issues, local network was fine but dns was not responding. My netstat -nr reports that my default route is changed to 255.255.255.255 through my wifi interface.  Turned off and on my wifi card and network again worked until it happened again a few minutes later.  Repeated the process, watching dhcp traffic on wireshark and did not see any rogue broadcasts trying to set that gateway.  What could be causing this?  <comment363011> Did you reboot/restart the router or other device doing the DHCP service? <comment363012> I did reboot the dhcp server and upstream router this morning when I thought it was a provider issue. However none of my other users have seen this problem so far. <comment363013> I would delete and re-create the wifi network in System Preferences  Network  Wi-Fi  Advanced... button. While you're at it, delete all the wifi networks in that list, especially ones you've used only once (Starbucks, etc,) or ones which are populated by iCloud Keychain.
