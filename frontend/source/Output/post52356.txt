How to set permission for an external hard drive formatted in Hfs+? <body> i've formatted an external hard drive in HFS+ using Ubuntu, and i've copied into 600 gb of data's. Now, i've connected it to a Mac OsX Lion and shared it to a lan with 4 mac's. The problem is that users can't create, copy or change any files!  So i need (i think) to change all permission and owner of the hard drive files: but how ?  The problem is that i try to change it (chmod, chown etc) but no change's is possible. All files and folder remain as admin:staff !  How to do ?  Thank you!
