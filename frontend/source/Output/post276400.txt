Is there version control software with commit messages that preserves macOS tags? <body> As I mentioned in my answer on tags best practices, the distributed version control software (VCS) Git does not preserve macOS tags (or other extended file attributes). Is there version control software (distributed or centralized) that features emcommit messages/em (like Git) emand/em that preserves macOS tags? (The built-in versioning system in macOS does not include commit messages.) I am especially interested in software that can be easily installed through one of the package managers for macOS, but any software that meets the criteria is welcome.
