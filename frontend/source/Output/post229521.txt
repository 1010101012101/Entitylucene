Paint.NET for Mac for pixel by pixel art creationg <body> Does anyone know any Mac alternative that has the exact features that Paint.NET has when it comes to creating pixel art, and emfree/em?   With Paint.NET I'm able to select whatever pixels in the grid to drag them, or change their colors all at once, or delete them, or to give the mirror/reflect (horizontally/vertically) effect.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XWqRY.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer229540> Not sure, but it might be possible to install the .net framework on OS X. That's just from a quick Google search, and I don't truly understand this stuff, but take a look. I believe you can also use Wine to run it.  Even though this isn't directed at your use case, take a look at this post about alternatives. This post also suggests alternatives, including Pixen, PikoPixel, Piskel, Aesprite, and setting up GIMP to work well with Pixel art. Forewarning, I don't do much pixel art (I've always just used GIMP) and therefore can't give you anything other than other's advice.  <answer229541> Though it is more of a Photoshop clone by its number of features, have you considered The Gimp? I don't know if it is going to fit your exact requirement, but it does have an excessive number of features including a magnified editing mode and color substitution.  Otherwise, have you tried Paint.NET via Wine? It seems that only the v3.5.x version might get somewhere, but with limitations.
