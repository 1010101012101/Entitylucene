Macbook Pro 15'' only switches after reboot to external monitor <body> I've got a new Macbook Pro 15'' with a Radeon 460 graphics card. I use an Aukey CB-C26 USB-C Hub with HDMI port and an LG Ultrawide display at work. When I reconnect the laptop to the hub, the display won't automatically switch on. The macbook recognizes the LG display because it shows up in the display settings and I can move the mouse over to the other screen but the screen itself will stay black. It will only turn on after a reboot while the setup itself stays the same.  I already tried using gfxCardStatus to switch between internal and discrete graphics but nothing happened. Has anybody got a solution for this problem?   Btw two of my colleagues have the same setup. One has the same problems. One usually doesn't. We already tried switch the Aukey hubs. But it works on one machine and not the other.   <comment344085> Have you contacted Aukey to see if there's an issue with their hub?  You mentioned 1 of your colleagues has the same problem and the other "usually doesn't".  That sounds to me like it's a problem with the hub. <comment344413> New info: The problem also occurs with another adapter. It seems to be a mac software problem. Does anybody no a workaround for this?
