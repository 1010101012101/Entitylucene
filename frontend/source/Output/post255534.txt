How could I automatically back-up any changes to my dropbox on my hard drive? (OS Sierra) <body> I have a weird problem, but I have a dropbox shared with many people, and I wish to save every change as a duplicate on my hard drive. Just for one of my dropbox folders.   I surfed the web, but did not find any way to automate it.   Any ideas?   I appreciate your answers. Thanks so much.   <comment318291> Unclear what you want here, Dropbox and Time Machine already save prior versions/changes for you, if TM is enabled. Will that functionality not fit your needs? <comment318320> Thank you. Well I have just an external hdd for time machine and I wish to have backups from that shared drop box every time a changes occurs. <comment318377> Requires a bit of extra nerdiness, but you might do what you want with version tracking software such as Git. <comment318609> Local machine will store recent changes. Try opening Time Machine when your external HD isn't connected - you'll see several days of backups or more, depending on free drive space. Other earlier versions of files can be pulled directly from Dropbox via web interface.
