How to delete files from a NAS drive in OSX <body> I am running Mavericks on a 2012 Mac Mini.  I have a WD MyBookLive NAS drive on the network which appears under SHARED in Finder.  There are lots of files on the drive I want to delete but my Mac seems unable to do it.  When choosing Move to Trash, a progress bar pops up and stays there forever.  <comment161369> Trash only works on local files - try a direct delete <comment161371> How would I do that? <comment161381> Interesting. Are you connecting to the NAS using SMB or AFP or some other protocol combination? I could see the .Trashes folder being a problem if the OS wants to move the files to be deleted rather than deleting them in place. <comment161521> It is using AFP I believe.  OSX gives me the option of Move to Trash so I am surprised that it is not supposed to work. <comment161617> If you are comfortable with Terminal, you can use `rm`. <comment161656> Thanks.  In the end, I did use "rm".  It took hours to run but got the job done in the end.
