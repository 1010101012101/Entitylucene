I recommend to backup your data to an external drive with Time Machine and rebuild the FusionDrive from scratch.  strongTime Machine backup/strong  ul liTo backup your main volume, boot to your main drive/li liAttach an external drive. The drive (or at least one volume) has to be formatted as an HFS+ Journaled volume. Check this with Disk Utility. If necessary repartition the external drive. All data on the drive will be destroyed after repartitioning/formatting it. The drive (or at least one volume) has to have the size of the volume to back up (or more)./li liUsually you will be asked if the external drive should serve as a Time Machine backup drive after plugging it in for the first time. If not, open Time Machine in the emSystem Preferences/em and configure the external drive as Time Machine backup drive.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iRSiy.png" alt="enter image description here"  Hit emSelect Backup Drive/em and choose your external drive:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rsYHt.png" alt="enter image description here"  Turn on Time Machine. The backup will be started after a few minutes and will take some time depending on the size./li /ul  strongRebuild Fusion Drive/strong  ul liBoot to Internet Recovery Mode by pressing kbdalt/kbdkbdcmd/kbdkbdR/kbd while starting your Mac./li liBooted to Internet Recovery Mode open Utilities → Terminal in the menubar and enter:br codediskutil cs list/code to get the CoreStorage listing.  /li liCopy the Logical Volume UUID, it's the fifth listed.  /li liNow delete the Logical Volume with codediskutil cs deleteVolume LVUUID/code.br In your case that's codediskutil cs deleteVolume E02059A8-E5D4-4DFF-9D0F-49408380838E/code/li liCopy the Logical Volume Group UUID, it's the first listed in the listing of codediskutil cs list/code.  /li liThen delete the Logical Volume Group with codediskutil cs delete LVGUUID/code.br In your case that's codediskutil cs delete BD4DE488-7C63-4FBA-9FAC-9B92CD56EDE4E/code  /li liEnter exit and quit 'Terminal'/li liOpen 'Disk Utility'.
