Got a new iPhone - where am I supposed to receive the verification code? <body> I just got a new iPhone to replace my broken one. I can't really do much without signing into iCloud, which requires me to use a verification code. This can either be sent to some other trusted apple device of mine (no such device exists), or as a text to my phone (that won't work because I'm emtrying to set up my phone/em). So how can I sign in to iCloud?  <answer291065> iCloud only asks for a trusted device after you add and verify the other devices.   ul lihttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204915/li /ul  Best be would be to log in to your AppleID on a computer and check your options, perhaps adding a friend or relative's mobile temporarily. Once youâ€™re set, you can then decide if two factor is right for you with only one device. Keep in mind, iPad and Mac can be trusted devices, too in addition to a phone.   If that fails, you may have to work with Apple support to see if you have indeed locked yourself out of your account. Hopefully there is a fail safe like the enrollment email that's active for two weeks where you can opt out or work through the recovery process.  <answer291072> Don't log in during set-up, but login afterwards using Settings. At that time you'll be able to request an authentication code via SMS.  <comment367491> Unfortunately, I cannot log into the iCloud because it also requires the 2-factor authentification, and I don't have any other apple devices. <comment367525> @Phoenix maybe this next ? https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/246867/unable-to-unlock-apple-account or https://support.apple.com/kb/HT204921 <comment367536> Did you see this? https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/291119/icloud-restore-enter-old-passcode <comment367663> I did not see that.
