how to convert windows drivers for mac <body> I have a wireless model, but they have provided the driver for Windows only. I would like to use it in my MacBook.  To convert it to Linux, I found there's a tool called ndiswrapper. But I need a program to convert Windows driver to Mac.  Is there anything like codendiswrapper/code available for Mac?  <comment180995> Is that a Hackintosh? <comment181312> I am not aware of anything that will allow you to run a Windows driver on a Mac and from what I can see ndiswrapper was never ported to the Mac.  you say you have "a wireless model." What exactly is that? Give us the make and model numbers and maybe someone has experience with it and can advise. (moved to comment as it is not an answer) <comment181487> Model is: ZTE AC8720 I've found driver downloads on their official site, but no MAC compatible ones found.. only windows installer is available.
