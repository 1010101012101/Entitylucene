Remove hyperlink formatting from address <body> I have created a Numbers spreadsheet containing a set of data including email addresses.  Some of these addresses appear as hyperlinks, and I can't seem to edit or change them.br Every time I try to select one it jumps to my Mail application.  I have tried to change formatting to "Text", but this seems to have no effect.  <answer158808> Highlight the entire link.  Then use Format/Remove link.  <answer179839> In older versions of Numbers, it is necessary to cut and repaste the hyperlinked line (with the AutoCorrect option mentioned already turned off.) Select the line, cut it, then paste it. It will then be pasted without hyperlinking.  This will be necessary even to edit the line. This is because clicking on the line to edit it will only perform the hyperlink action. This is a seriously amazing failure on someones part at Apple. The fact that this went unaddressed for years, unfortunately, is par-for-the-course for Apple.  <answer186407> I have a spreadsheet where all the cells in one column contain the hyperlinks.  I select and copy that column and pasted it in a new Excel spreadsheet.  Went to Edit / Clear / Hyperlinks.   Then pasted it back into my Numbers document.  That may be cheating, but that works.    <answer191658> In the Numbers 3.5.3 this is extremely difficult to do. Thanks to @Vev for giving me the hint to discover how to do it.  ol liFirst: expand the size of the cell so there is some white space around the hyperlink. /li liClick once in the white space to select the Cell.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3DrL3.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liClick once again in the white space, to enable the Text Cursor. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WhLJp.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liRight-Click on the hyperlink, which selects it and provides a context menu. (If you don't have right-click enabled, use Ctrl-click on the Mac)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pgwcV.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liSelect "Edit Link" in the context menu.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gzsLg.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liClick the "Remove" button from the Edit Link dialog. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/djzSv.png" alt="enter image description here"/li /ol  <answer234222> If you have a long list of entries (some of my spreadsheets have 300+ entries and the emails are always hyperlinked!!) here's what I do:  ol liCopy the column of emails into a text editing program such as bbedit./li lireplace instances of '@" with at - or really any unique string/li liI also do the same thing with the dot - replace '.' with DOT/li liThen I paste the result back into the column (making sure they're in the correct rows./li liIf I want to use the list to send out a mass email, I just do the same thing in revers: Copy the column into bbedit and replace at with '@'./li /ol  A pain but easier than doing each formatting by hand.   It's really stupid of Apple and it should be changed.   <answer239331> Turns out there's an even simpler way to do this.  Just go to Edit - Substitutions and uncheck SmartLinks.  Problem solved.  (FYI, works the same in Pages as well).  <answer242688> In Numbers '09 (version 2.3) there is much easier way. Select all of the cells that you which to remove hyperlinks from, im my case Command+A to select everything. Then open your Inspector. In the second tab from the far right called "hyperlink", at the bottom there is a checkbox called "Make all hyperlinks inactive". That's it!  I hope this is helpful as I'm so glad I found this!  <comment247646> I was having a real problem with Step 3, the click has to be very quick. I was holding the mouse button down too long and could never get the cursor. <comment298627> Not sure if the discussion is about Numbers '09 or not, but it can't really hurt.
