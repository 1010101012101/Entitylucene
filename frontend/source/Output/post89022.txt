How to automatically close an app when I shut down the mac? <body> My father would always scold me that so many applications are open when he turns on the computer which he says consumes computer memory. I always forget to close the app by right -clickingquit Is there any way to automatically close an app when shutting down? When I searched at google. They talked about iCalendar, but it was too confusing so I came here to ask.   <answer89025> Basically all apps will be closed when shutting down, simply because the computer will be turned off. Just to be sure: Shutting down means: Turning the computer off.  However the behavior after rebooting differs depending on the operation system version you are using. If you are running emLion/em or emMountain Lion/em there is a emfeature/em that allows to strongautomatically  restart/strong all open applications after rebooting/start up. In emMountain Lion/em you will be asked before the computer shuts down if you want the applications to be restarted after reboot. Just uncheck the checkbox.  img src="https://i.imgur.com/JtCMkvv.png" alt="enter image description here"  If you're confusing emshutting down/em with emstandby/em and/or emsleep mode/em you will have no built-in way to solve it (but an AppleScript may help). But at least I can provide you with a shortcut: Pressing kbdâŒ˜ Command/kbd  kbdQ/kbd will "completely" close an application. You can use this shortcut instead of right clicking the dock icon to close the app.  <answer89026> If you are using mac os x lion or later, which you apparently do, you can just uncheck the "reopen windows when logging back in" when the log-out or shut down menu comes up!  This way your perviously opened app won't open again!   If they do... you have certain applications set as a* login item this is fixed by opening system pref - users &amp; groups - login items and review that list.  <comment104391> Apps do close down when you log out - are you and your father using the same login, sounds like you should use separate ones - also as OSX uses virtual memory leaving apps open should not affect users' use much <comment104417> Lion had the same option in the shutdown dialog box, but it always defaulted to checked (and I believe at one stage it just flat out didnt work)
