How can I remove specific top hits in Safari's address bar? <body> (Similar to this How can I remove an autocomplete suggestion from Safari&#39;s address bar?, but those answers do not help)  A site I visit frequently is located at:  precodehttp://example.com/sub /code/pre  Unfortunately when I begin typing "exa" in the address bar, I get two propositions in top hits:  precodehttp://example.com http://example.com/sub /code/pre  with the first being highlighted, and used if I (miss the arrow down key and) hit enter  I have bookmarked and favorited the codehttp://example.com/sub/code site and try to never visit codehttp://example.com/code but never the less it always shows as top site.  I cleared my history of each and every entry to codehttp://example.com/*/code except for codehttp://example.com/sub/code, and redo that step every time I accidently visit the wrong site  And no, I don't want do delete my whole browsing history  <answer266315> It's actually not possible to remove the root domain from Safari's top hits. I've always had this problem and find it irritating.     As seen, I've never visited Apple's US website, but only the SG site. However, it still auto completes to it.      img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mqkOC.png" alt="Image"   Unfortunately, the problem is that Safari autofills the root domain, before auto completing the sub domain.  So, even if you don't visit codehttp://example.com/code, it would still show up since you visit code/sub/code.  <comment334202> Well then I'm out of luck. Thanks anyway. <comment334289> @Pit, you're welcome :)
