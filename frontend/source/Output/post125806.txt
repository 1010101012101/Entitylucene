Lacie Porsche not working on MBP 15" <body> I've bought a Lacie Porsche usb key two weeks ago and it used to work well but now I can't mount it on my MBP, it's not even detected by the system profiler... But it works well on a friend MBA or even worse, on a Windows computer...  My USB ports works well with other devices like HDD or some usb key of other brands. Any tips ?  <comment147250> Use Disk Utility to see it there? <comment147251> @Buscarì›ƒ nop, the device is not shown on the left panel. <comment147264> Format the USB device to exFat for example and try to mount it again.
