I ran a .dmg by mistake <body> I ran a .dmg file from an e-mail by mistake, and it opened and showed the installation. I, however, closed the window and unmounted the image.  I'm I safe or should I run some virus scanner? If so can anyone recommend one for the Mac?  Thanks!  <comment252591> Did you just mount the Disk Image or actually run the Package Installer in it? <comment252593> I double clicked the Disk Image, but I didn't run the installer in the package. I am also downloading ClamXav <comment252596> I don't know how reliant I would be on a free Ani-Virus. I wouldn't do it. What you want to do is go to Terminal and type this: `hdiutil internet-enable -query /path/to/image`. If it shows as disabled, you're fine. With enabled the disk image can install automatically on mount. <comment252598> I ran the command you stated, and it shows as disabled. But, i'm not really sure what that means. Please could you go into more detail. <comment252601> Basically it means, when you mount the image, it'll unpack/copy it's data to the directory it was in. It can be abused. You can read more about it by `man hdiutil`, or [here](http://macstuff.beachdogs.org/blog/?p=29). Still a virus scan wouldn't harm you, and if you don't backup, this would be a good time to start. I have used [Bitdefender](http://www.bitdefender.com/solutions/antivirus-for-mac.html?icid=NA_mac2016_homepage_banner), you can scan with the 30-day trial.
