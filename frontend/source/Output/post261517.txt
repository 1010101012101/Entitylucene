iPhone Screen Recording simulation on Windows <body> I need to make a video of browsing websites on iPhone. I don't have a Mac so I can't make Airplay mirroring and record it there. Is there any way to do it on Windows 10? I need to keep video resolution same as iPhone has.  It's one time thing, freely is the best.  <answer261540> You can use the program AirServer on Windows to let your iPhone AirPlay mirror to the PC in order to record the stream.  AirServer has a free 7-day trial, so for a one time thing, it could be done without paying.  Download it from here: AirServer Download  Other similar programs are Reflector 2 and X-Mirage. However, Reflector 2 watermarks the video during the trial period.
