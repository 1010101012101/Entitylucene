Mac HDD still losing space after deleting files <body> I'm working on videos. I'm capturing them with a software and I save them as MP4. Then I compress them as MOV. After that I upload them to YouTube. However I lose about 1.5 GB from my hard disk while I'm doing this. (I delete these videos after I upload.)  How can I fix this situation?  <answer107299> it could be just used a swap space that should be cleared up by a reboot (probably some terminal command too).  Could also be you are on a laptop with time machine and have mobile backups enabled (aka local snapshots).   <answer113900> Could you try:  Finder -- Preference -- Advance -- select Empty Trash securely. After that, empty your Trash.  I got the same problem and now it's working after fixing like that.  <comment125839> Are you using finder to measure free disk space on OS X or another tool? Have you [ruled out local Time Machine backup snapshots](http://support.apple.com/kb/ht4878) as a reason why the system would retain these files after you delete them? <comment126051> well I'm on laptop and I'm sure I'm loosing because of videos. I'm checking storage left and it decreases after video capture & edit. <comment126059> so do you use time machine?
