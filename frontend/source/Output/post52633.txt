iTunes only syncs last album added to iPhone <body> I have iTunes set to manually manage the music on my iPhone. In the past this has worked without trouble. I went through my music and picked albums or songs and just dragged them onto the iPhone. When I added more music and the sync process was already working, it would just enqueue the songs. At the end I would have all of the music I dragged onto the iPhone icon actually sit on my iPhone. Perfect.  Now, lately this doesn't seem to work anymore. I drag an album and it begins to sync. Then I go on and add more albums, but each time I add something new, the currently running sync is aborted and only the new music will continue to sync. This amounts to many partial albums on my iPhone with only the very last being complete most of the time.  Now, what has changed? Does anyone else experience the same?  It's on a MacBook late 2008, Lion 10.7.4, iTunes 10.6.1 and the iPhone is a 4S with iOS 5.1.1 on it.  I tried both WiFi Sync and via USB.
