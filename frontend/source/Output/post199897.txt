Why wont my 13" MacBook Core 2 Duo (2007, a1224) power on? <body> My MacBook (a1181, 13'' Core 2) will not start.  It has a completely dead battery, but my bought new Apple branded magsafe's light will not come on, and the battery lights will not come on.  The SMC was reset, and, being that it will not power on, I cannot reset the PRAM.  It has been tested with and without the battery, with several magsafes and I have even replaced the old, worn out magsafe board. What are the possibilities?  Was shipped USPS cross the southern US during summer months, could the shipping truck have gotten to hot?  OS is 10.7.5 Lion  Edit:  it is an a1181, (I have an iMac 1224, there's were the confusion came from).  Original Battery.  Only thing new is the Magsafe Port.   Also, if it does try to come on (rarely) it's just stays in POST ( still means no PRAM reset).  RAM was upgraded long before this happened by the original owner, but has been switched to the original again (put the 4gb upgrade in my iMac).  <comment240763> Are you sure that Model Number, A1224, is correct? Because Model Number A1224 is a iMac not MacBook. In 2007 Apple released two 13" MackBook's, MacBook (13-inch Mid 2007) and MacBook (13-inch Late 2007) both with Model Number A1181. <comment240765> Is your battery the original one? If yes it might have damaged a lot of thing inside if you left it inside.`\n`Please edit your question to clarify this key point.
