How to update Dock preview to Applications folder after hiding apps with chflags <body> I am using codechflags hidden/code method to hide apps in code/Applications/code folder.   It immediately hides the application in emFinder/em, but when I click on the emApplications/em folder in emDock/em (image below), I can still see the hidden applications there, until I restart the computer.  So the question is: strongIs it possible to also update the visibility of the application in the emDock/em preview to emApplications/em folder without restaring the computer?/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xNbhu.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer292763> I tested it and doing codekillall Dock/code in Terminal.app does the job.     This specific emkillall/em command will essentially restart Dock and therefore the emApplications/em folder preview gets updated as well.   hr  hr  Alternatively you can open code/Applications/Utilities/Activity Monitor.app/code search for codeDock/code, select it and click the X in the top left corner of the window.  <comment369345> You actually shouldn't be needed to kill finder after setting chflags. My best guess is that you are running El Capitan or anything after that. [I recently answered a question where OP was trying to do the same thing](https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/290399/126929). OP was pretty tight lipped when it came to giving additional info, but in my last comment to my own answer I came to the realization that it likely worked for me because I've disabled SIP. I'm pretty sure this is the reason it's not working for you  as well. <comment369347> @Joonas: SIP is disabled. Running Sierra. Basically It works partially without restarting computer - if I click on `Dock - Applications - Open in Finder`, then even without restarting the app folder is hidden. However, it's not hidden right in `Dock-Applications`, until I restart. <comment369348> These two paths... I don't quite understand what they are. Shouldn't both open in Finder regardless? <comment369349> I've added a stab at guessing your `spctl --status` and OS version - please correct @pablo. I'll delete our other comments since we're beyond them now. I'm curious as to the real nut to be cracked here now that SIP is implicated. <comment369351> I've updated my question to depict 2 paths. <comment369353> I would have to test it to see what my mac, but I wouldn't be surprised if this dock `applications alias` or what ever it is didn't honor chflags... That's what it seems like. <comment369354> @Joonas: why it honors after restart? I would think there is some cache, which need to be reset. <comment369356> Oh (forgot about that). Well in that case I'd guess it updates itself differently... It's independent from Finder, which also brought me to realize.... in that case, you should probably do `killall -kill Dock`. <comment369359> If you blur almost everything, the two screenshots are useless without mentioning which folders/apps are/should be hidden. <comment369362> @Pablo, I edited the question pretty heavy handedly... (Assuming it gets approved) so be sure to edit it if you feel It's wrong. <comment369366> @klanomath: the problem applies to all non-built-in apps that I installed. <comment369367> @Joonas: actually killing Dock helps. Is it graceful method? <comment369370> @Pablo, I'm not sure what that means in this context. It's forces Dock to close and then it gets restored. I don't think there are any processes Dock has that this could disrupt. If you add or remove a dock item and immediately run killall, Dock won't forget it. I was reading doc for [killall](https://developer.apple.com/legacy/library/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/killall.1.html) to find out more about how it kills a processs, but it doesn't really clarify. My understanding is that if you kill Finder this way, you better make sure you don't have any file transfer going on... <comment369373> ...but that is Finder. Either way, I added another way for closing Dock in my answer. Just know that you can chain the killall with the chflags: `sudo chflags hidden /Applications/Dictionary.app; killall Dock`
