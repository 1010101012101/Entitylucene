Finding iPhone which is on silent <body> I have an iPhone 5 on silent in my room (somewhere). iCloud's Find My iPhone feature obviously will show me that the phone is in my building.   Is there any other way I can try to find it? Is there an alarm, etc.?   <answer216761> iCloud's "play a sound" feature will ding even with the phone on silent.   <comment262052> It will even play maximum volume regardless of the volume setting on the phone. <comment262131> I genuinely didn't know about this feature. Thanks everyone!
