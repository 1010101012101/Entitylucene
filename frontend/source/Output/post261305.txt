Mouse clicks not responding on Mid-2010 iMac <body> I am working on an end users machine which is somehow not responding to mouse clicks, left or right.  I've already rebooted, tried multiple USB mice (PC and Mac) and ran First Aid on the HDD from Disk Utility in Recovery. Had to navigate to it using Tab/Ctrl+Tab on the keyboard.  Any suggestions? Everything I'm reading is suggesting to power off a wireless mouse but this is a kiosk station that has never used a wireless mouse. There was a wireless keyboard nearby which I powered off but it did not fix the issue.  ul liIntro.   July 27, 2010   Disc.

If so, try resetting the SMC and NVRAM <comment327252> I reset the SMC by unplugging the iMac for 15sec and reset the NVRAM by holding down Cmd+Opt+P+R on the startup chime. I still cannot click anything.
