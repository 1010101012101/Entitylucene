Which file system for an SD card permanently mounted on my Mac? <body> To extend my limited Macbook Pro storage I keep a 128 GB micro SD always mounted in the SD card reader (thanks to Nifty Minidrive). I use it for emstatic/em files:  music, photo and video files I need to refer to, but that don't change often.  The SD card is formatted in codeexFAT/code and from time to time it gets disconnected when I bump my Mac during my commute, and to fix the file system corruption I need to mount it on a Windows PC (since codeDisk Utility/code doesn't seem to be able to fix it).   Since I'll use this SD card only on my Mac, should I format it as codeHFS+/code instead?br I've read that a emjournaled file system/em can cope better with this kind of problems, and codeDisk Utility/code could repair it if needed.   Is there any risk (i.e. excessive wear on the SD card) in formatting my micro SD in codeHFS+/code?   Will be codeHFS+/code more reliable than codeexFAT/code?  <comment340943> No SD card could be called 'reliable'. Don't keep your only copy of anything on one. <comment340944> @Tetsujin That's for sure. I still keep a backup of that data on my Time Capsule and on an external USB disk. My question is about **which file system is more reliable for this use**. You know, it's annoying when you are at work, need to read **that** file you left on the SD, but the SD isn't mounted because the file system got corrupted, and the other copy you have is at home! <comment340946> I'd take a guess that GUID/HFS+ would be more 'fixable on the fly' but I have no hard evidence, so can't provide an actual answer. <comment344706> Since I first wrote my question, I reformatted my SD card in `GUID` + `HFS+`, and didn't experience any file system issue even after several "accidents" (mostly card bumped and power loss). I got it disconnected a few times, got warnings that reminded me to clean unmont the card before disconnecting, but didn't experience any real issue. So in for this application, `HFS+` seems to be more "robust" than `exFAT`. Still can't tell if `HFS+` can affect SD card life in a different way than `exFAT`.
