Navigate folder structure in Open/Save File Dialog with keyboard? <body> After hitting kbd⌘/kbd-kbdO/kbd, how can I navigate my folders and select a file to open using only my keyboard?   In particular, how can I get the focus into the folder list? (From there I can use arrows or start typing the first letters of the desired file/folder.)  In some programs I can rely on hitting kbdTAB/kbd 5 times, but this isn't reliable and I figure there must be a better way.  <answer39010> System Prefences  Keyboard  Keyboard Shortcuts  Enable "Full Keyboard Access: All Controls", then you can use Tab to move between elements until your file list is highlighted, and use the arrows to select your file, in fact you should immediately be able to type a letter or use the keys as the default focus should be on the file list.  <answer39020> File dialogs should support the same shortcuts as Finder.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wGxOH.png" alt=""  You can also press kbd~/kbd, kbd//kbd, or kbd⇧⌘G/kbd to open the Go to Folder sheet.  If Full Keyboard Access is enabled (in the keyboard preferences), kbd⇧⇥/kbd moves focus from the file browser to the source list.  <comment212132> Also, Cmd-downarrow will navigate to the currently highlighted directory (rather than "open"ing it.)
