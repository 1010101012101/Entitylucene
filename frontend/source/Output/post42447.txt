How do I make a custom context menu item in Finder? <body> I do a lot of command line work, which involves a lot of folder navigation with codecd/code.  To make my life easier, I'd love to be able to right-click on a folder in Finder and have a context menu item I could click that simply opens Terminal and codecd/codes to that directory.  How would I go about this in OS X (Snow Leopard)? I'm a website developer, so familiar with programming languages and computer literate, so feel free to get technical with me.  <answer42450> If you want the codecd/code command in a new window or tab, you can simply turn on the built-in services, "New Terminal at Folder" and "New Terminal Tab at Folder", by going to codeSystem Preferences &gt; Keyboard &gt; Keyboard Shortcuts &gt; Services &gt; Files and Folders/code.  If you want the codecd/code command in the active window or tab, you can make a simple Automator Service.   ol liIn a new Automator Service, change "Service receives selected" to codefolders/code./li liAdd a "Run AppleScript" action./li liReplace code(* Your script goes here *)/code with the following:  precodetell application "Terminal"     reopen     activate     set cmd to "cd " &amp; quoted form of posix path of input     try         if busy of selected tab of window 1 then error         do script with command cmd in window 1     on error         do script with command cmd     end try end tell /code/pre/li liSave the service with whatever name you want your menu item to have, then it's ready to go./li /ol  An alternative to using a contextual menu is to just type codecd/code (with a trailing space) then drag the folder to the Terminal window.  <comment48261> Thanks, joelseph. Yeah, I currently use the drag folder into Terminal trick, but would love to just be able to right-click on a Folder and have it open Terminal, then having to open Terminal, type `cd `, and then drag the folder. I'll give the above a go and let you know how I get on!
