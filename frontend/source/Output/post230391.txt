fsck -fy hangs on Checking catalog file + issues booting (MacBook) <body> Last night my MacBook Pro crashed. This morning I tried turning the computer on, and it had a few issues..  ul liComputer doesn't get past initial boot up loading./li liFan activates loudly while starting up./li liScreen is generally slightly tinted green, with light green horizontal stripes going across the display every couple pixels./li liInitial loading screen has a green progress bar./li liScreen occasionally has a black stripe with rainbow pixels dotted across the top of the screen./li liRendered pixels are generally shifted up or down a single pixel every few inches across the screen./li liAfter hanging with a white screen for ~4 minutes, it switches to a blue screen with vertical red stripes./li liA couple minutes later the computer reboots and the process restarts./li /ul  So I try using single-user mode, because obviously I'm not getting anywhere with this boot-up loop.  I follow this process:  precode$ /sbin/fsck -fy ** /dev/rdisk1 ** Root file system    Executing fsck_hfs (Version hfs-305.10.1). ** Checking Journaled HFS Plujs vloume.    The volume name is Macintosh HD ** Checking extents overflow tile. ** Checking catalog file. /code/pre  It proceeds to hang here until I code^C/code out of codefsck/code.  I try rebuilding the catalog...  precode$ fsck_hfs -y -Rc -d /dev/disk0s2 Unable to open block device /dev/disk0s2: Resource busyjournal_replay(/dev/disk0s2) returned 16 ** /dev/rdisk0s2 (NO WRITE)         Using cacheBlockSize=32K cacheTotalBlock=16384 cacheSize=524288K.

To repair the hard drive you generally use code/sbin/fsck -fy/code, right? The only problem is that gives me the same as before, hanging on the catalog file.  I'm not really sure what to do!  <answer230398> When you can't get a clean run of fsck (which you might need to let run for a handful of hours) - then it's time to make a decision:  ul liback up what you can/need to and erase the volume/li liseek other software options to attempt repair/li /ul  In my expereice, if you don't have lots of IO errors (code-B/code option for codefsck_hfs/code) then the erase will restore full function and you can reinstall the OS and restore from backup. I've also not had much luck forcing codefsck_hfs/code to rebuild parts when the plain code/sbin/fsck -fy/code fails - but you could get lucky there with an unusual corruption pattern on this drive.  The second option doesn't have great promise. Disk Warrior seems to be one of the decent utilities to try when fsck won't work - but unless you have lots of specific corruption issues - the time you spend wiping and reinstalling usually doesn't outweigh the cost of that software. It also may or may not work. If Disk Warrior also fails to repair or rebuild the catalog, you're back to the decision point - wipe or escalate to even more expensive / specialized support like opening an engineering ticket with Apple or someone that's able to dump the filesystem structure more deeply for analysis.
