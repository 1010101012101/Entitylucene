Transfer outlook 11 contacts from an old account to a new one <body> My HDD on my Mac was failing on me, so I quickly copied a lot of the files/folder to a new hdd I bought and had to reinstall everything. After this, the old HDD started to become unstable and wouldn't allow me to do a proper clone/export of files, such as my contacts for Outlook 2011.  So this is my question, how can I go about adding my contacts from my old Outlook 2011 folder to my current Outlook 2011 account on my new HDD? I tried opening it but I'm getting a "Outlook cannot open the file because it is not associated with the default identity contacts" message. All I have to work with is the files/folders where Outlook 2011 saves it's data.
