ssh hacking attempts - how come? <body> Over the last few days, I've noticed lots of messages pertaining to attempted hacking of the root account via sshd (a.k.a Remote Login). Here's a section of one such attempt from the Console log:  precodeMar 19 11:54:20 gamimac sshd[2604]: error: PAM: authentication error for root from 183.3.202.114 via 192.168.0.4 [...] Mar 19 11:54:20 gamimac sshd[2604]: error: PAM: authentication error for root from 183.3.202.114 via 192.168.0.4 Mar 19 11:54:20 gamimac sshd[2602]: Received disconnect from 183.3.202.114: 11:  [preauth] Mar 19 11:54:20 gamimac sshd[2602]: Disconnected from 183.3.202.114 [preauth] Mar 19 11:54:20 gamimac com.apple.xpc.launchd[1] (com.openssh.sshd.E31BE9F0-ED73-46BD-AD8E-5C4F2263C580[2602]): Service exited with abnormal code: 255 /code/pre  192.168.0.4 is the NAT'd local IP of my Mac. What I would like to know is how an external IP (in Guangzhou, China, apparently) initiate a ssh connection through my router when there is NO currently configured port forwarding for ANY port? My router explicitly states that unless there is a port forwarding exclusion configured, then the connection will be blocked.  Not having any idea how this is happening, I have shut down sshd on my Mac (luckily, I only need to ssh emto/em machines from this machine) and disabled the root user. Any help or insight into this would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks, GAM  <comment282877> The first thing to check would be to scan your router's public address from outside of your network for open ports to confirm whether what your router "states" (btw, how does a router "state" something?) is true. It would also be better to have password login disabled in sshd configuration. <comment284114> You're on the right track. I just went to http://www.grc.com to conduct some test(s) and the results were inconsistent with the modem's stated configuration (different ports to ssh 'tho). When I contacted my ISP they said they'd be sending me a new modem/router. I guess modems can fail. And yes - key-only ssh is the way to go.
