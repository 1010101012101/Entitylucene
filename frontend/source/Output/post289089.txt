Cannot enable iCloud Photos Library from anywhere <body> My iCloud Photo Library has been in a not enabled status (as if I have never used a iOS 8 or later device).   When viewed from icloud.com: it seems that feature is uninitialized, and console log gives me codePhotos: P2.Application: startupFail/code  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DEWIm.jpg" alt="iCloud.com Photos"  On macOS Photos.app or iOS Photos: both iCloud Photo Library and My Photo Stream can be enabled, but it won't ever upload. Shared photo streams worked well.  Note: I have been contacting Apple Support for a while (with no useful reply) and also reported it as a bug: http://www.openradar.me/32369161
