Mount NFS share in /Volumes as a drive <body> Ok, this might be a stupid question to ask, but trying to mount a NFS share (from a Linux machine, if it's worth anything) in a folder that resides in /Volumes never makes the share appear in Finder (not in Volumes anyway).  The folder was made by simply codesudo mkdir /Volumes/folder_name/code and the mount was made using autofs like this:  precode/Volumes/folder_name    auto_nfs      -nolock,locallocks,rdirplus /code/pre  I should mention the folder is accessible though the terminal, but it just doesn't show in Finder.  On the other hand, if I modify code/etc/auto_master/code to this:  precode/Volumes  auto_nfs      -nolock,locallocks,rdirplus /code/pre  the folder appears, but I loose all my other drives (except the system one and Network)  At the moment, I'm mounting to a regular folder on the system drive which I've symlinked to a folder in /Volumes. Oddly, that works fine, but it does appear as a symlink and it bothers me (and possibly other users).  <answer83620> There is a boring, technical explanation (which I cannot find right now) for this behavior . I worked around it by adding code/Volumes/code to the strongFavorites/strong section in the Finder's sidebar  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/N4jcI.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer119200> I have spent quite a bit of time figuring out automounts of NFS shares in OS X...  Somewhere along the line, Apple decided allowing mounts directly into /Volumes should not be possible:  /etc/auto_master strong(see last line)/strong:  precode# # Automounter master map # +auto_master        # Use directory service /net            -hosts      -nobrowse,hidefromfinder,nosuid /home           auto_home   -nobrowse,hidefromfinder /Network/Servers    -fstab /-          -static /-          auto_nfs    -nobrowse,nosuid /code/pre  /etc/auto_nfs strong(this is all one line)/strong:     precode/Volumes/my_mount    -fstype=nfs,noowners,nolockd,noresvport,hard,bg,intr,rw,tcp,nfc nfs://192.168.1.1:/exports/my_share /code/pre  This will not work (anymore!) though it "should".  precode$ sudo automount -cv ... automount: /Volumes/my_mount: mountpoint unavailable /code/pre  h2What's the solution?/h2  It's so easy my jaw dropped when I figured it out. Basically, we trick OS X into thinking we're mounting * somewhere else. *  When you're talking about paths in just about any environment, the root folder is the highest path you can reach, whether it's codeC:\/code (windows) or code//code (*nix)  When you're at this path, attempting to reach the parent path, via code../code will keep you at the root path.  For example: code/../../../..//code is still just code//code  By now, a few of you have already figured it out.  h2TL;DR / Solution:/h2  Change your code/etc/auto_nfs/code config from strong(this is all one line)/strong:  precode/Volumes/my_mount    -fstype=nfs,noowners,nolockd,noresvport,hard,bg,intr,rw,tcp,nfc nfs://192.168.1.1:/exports/my_share /code/pre  To strong(this is all one line)/strong:  precode/../Volumes/my_mount    -fstype=nfs,noowners,nolockd,noresvport,hard,bg,intr,rw,tcp,nfc nfs://192.168.1.1:/exports/my_share /code/pre  And re-run the automounter:  precode$ sudo automount -cv ... automount: /Volumes/my_mount: mounted /code/pre  ..... there you go! Technically code/../Volumes/code is still code/Volumes/code, but the automounter does not see things that way ;)  This configuration persists the mount across restarts, and creates the mountpoint automatically.  h1I KNOW, RIGHT?/h1  <comment96234> Where in Finder are you looking /Volumes or the top level in Finder? ie if you show the fullpath in Finder what is at the top of the window? <comment96717> Can you not mount NFS volumes through Finder's "Connect to Server" feature? I don't have an NFS share to attempt with. <comment96890> Unfortunately, this does not solve the problem, as I need the drives to be available when I click on the machine (under Devices). <comment96891> @bispymusic Yes I can, but it doesn't give me any mounting options, so I loose on performance visibly. Also, to have them automount on startup I have to add them to Login Items. <comment96893> @Mark I need them appear at the top level in Finder (the actual machine), so that other users find them comfortably. I know OS X has a way of telling folders from drives, so just creating a folder in /Volumes does not work out of the box, but I don't know what that is. <comment96926> @CatalinM Instead of mounting them as Login Items you can auto mount them at system boot time via the fstab file. Read the man page for fstab for more info. <comment97020> @HairOfTheDog I thought about that, but last time I checked, there no fstab in /etc, like on my Linux machine. I learned ML uses autofs, so I worked with that. Maybe I missed something along the way? <comment97111> @HairOfTheDog Ok, so I checked how things appear in 2 places: 1. Top level in Finder (Computer if you access the Go menu) doesn't show the NFS share. 2. If I go to my Startup Disk (names System in my case) and go into the Volumes folder, I see the NFS Share and it works correctly. Presumably they are the same folders, but... <comment97256> @CatalinM the /etc/fstab file does not exist by default. You have to create it.  See this Apple document for more info, specifically page 9 where it describes fstab and how autofs interacts with fstab.  And please up-vote my answer if you found it useful <comment97473> @HairOfTheDog This is very interesting, because on my ML machine it was already there (said i should edit it with vifs, but I shrugged away and used nano anyway). On my wife's Lion machine it wasn't there, but I created it. Worked like a charm on both machines. Thanks! PS: You didn't link any Apple document... <comment97484> @CatalinM Dang I hate it when I forget to add links.  Here it is:  http://images.apple.com/business/docs/Autofs.pdf <comment139194> I will try it this weekend! <comment268137> Did you solve the issue of the shares not being visible in Finder? <comment270865> while useful, this does not answer the question of how to make autofs mounted folders show up in the finder...
