Mac Book Pro 2012 model: My sharing name automatically changes <body> I have a mac book pro from 2013 (mid 2012 model) the only customisation I have done is install a bigger hard drive. Whenever I go into sharing settings the name of my computer to others is the serial number which makes using air drop confusing when trying to find my computer. I have tried changing it before but whenever my computer goes to sleep then I open it again it has changed back. Please help (I'm running El Capitan)  <answer260996> Just to make sure you're changing your computer name in the right place, follow these steps:  ol liGo to System Preferences/li liClick on Sharing/li liIn the Computer Name field, enter the name you want your computer to use./li liExit System Preferences/li /ol  Now, assuming you were already doing that, you should reset your NVRAM.  strongReset your PRAM/NVRAM/strong  Older Macs had what's called Parameter RAM (PRAM), newer Macs use Non-Volatile Random-Access Memory (NVRAM).
