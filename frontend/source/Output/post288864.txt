What happens if I accidentally interrupted iOS software update on iphone <body> I was updating my iPhone and I accidentally pressed the home and lock button together thus interrupting the update. It has directed me to a link where I was instructed to connect the iPhone to iTunes and download the update. (I clicked update; not restore, of course.) My question is will there be any harm to my data?  <answer288899> h2Answer/h2  strongNo/strong. If your iPhone works after performing a force reboot (holding the Home button and the sleep button for a few seconds), strongyou are good to go/strong.  hr  h2Explanation/h2  iOS downloads the delta update first and starts the update process. You may have interrupted iOS while extracting the update files or checking them for consistency.  hr  h2Additional information/h2  The update will probably appear in Settings  General  Storage. Feel free to install the update using your iPhone or a computer with iTunes installed.  Did this answer your question?
