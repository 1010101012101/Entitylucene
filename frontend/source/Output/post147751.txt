How to (Right click + Move mouse to the Left) in MACBOOK PRO <body> I am using Genymotion and playing game: Clash of Clan. To Zoom in I need to : Right click + Move mouse to the Left. How can i do this Macbook pro retina display 15 inch. I know that  tapping with two fingers means right click. I tapped with two fingers &amp; without pulling them back i moved them to right of screen but nothing seems to happen. I also used my third finger to move right while tapped with 2 fingers but neither of these two tricks worked.  <answer147761> ol liPress down on the trackpad with two fingers to click the trackpad./li liKeep the fingers held down and move them left./li liRelease fingers./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/t8Pss.png"  <comment174174> Try Control/click or Cmd/click [system uses ctrl, some games use cmd]
