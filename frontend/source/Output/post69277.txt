We need you to offer much more information in order to allow us to help you.  What type of iPhone, which OS, what was the last thing you did (OS upgrade?), what have you done to try to fix it already, have you tried plugging it into your computer running iTunes etc etc.  Fill is in with more details, and we will be able to help more.  Thanks, Dan. <comment85684> It sounds as if the iphone is in recovery mode. The answer from Braunson should help.
