Are there any benefits to deleting unused Mac OS X kernel extensions? <body> I find that many of the kernel extensions in code/System/Library/Extensions/code are inapplicable to my MacBook, such as extensions for fibre channel cards, firewire, graphics cards I don't have, etc. Is there any benefit (in boot time, RAM footprint, etc.) to deleting these unneeded extensions?  <answer95696> Probably there is a benefit in boot up time.   ul liFirst I would record the current boot up time (it is reported in the Console)./li liNext I would make sure to know what I am doing…/li /ul  To delete actively loaded .kext,  I recommended to find which ones are actually loaded.  ul liI suggest getting an app called Kext Wizard./li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xidlv.png" alt="Kext Wizard Screenshot"  This will tell you emexactly/em what is loaded, rather than just using the list from System Information. System Information might not give you everything, and Kext Wizard could find others that were loaded.   <answer95755> Actually, any difference in boot up time would be negligible - OS X doesn't boot code/mach_kernel/code — it boots the kernel cache (code/System/Library/Caches/com.apple.kext.caches/Startup/kernelcache/code), which already has the kexts you emare/em using. This gets rebuilt if code/System/Library/Extensions/code gets modified (or if you codetouch(1)/code it deliberately).   In terms of the filesystem space, as of Snow Leopard, everything is compressed. Meaning you're not really wasting too much space, either.   There is a emdownside/em, however — if you delete kexts, even with kext wizard, or whichever utility, there is a remote chance that some kext will be loaded on demand (e.g. via IOKit probing, on some USB device, for example). In this case, a kext might not be found - and you lose a driver.  In short, if it ain't broken, don't fix it. Leave code/System/Library/Extensions/code intact.   <answer148779> All highly suspect. Opaque binaries early in boot and thin explanations if you would even consider them explanations.  Something's up.   <comment175269> Technologeeks and Buscar are correct. Don't touch these files at all. David Kim's answer is incorrect, illogical and unintelligible.
