Turning off or restarting iPhone if lock button is broken? <body> Now that I know how to lock the iPhone if the lock button is broken, I was wondering how I can restart the phone or turn it off.  The lock button is completely unresponsive and holding it down does nothing. Are there any workarounds besides replacing the button?  <answer47416> You have a couple options:  ul liSimply let the phone discharge until it turns off. Then, you can charge it again and it should turn on when it reaches a high enough battery level./li liIf you dare, you can strongreset the device's network settings/strong which will restart it (but obviously, also clear your network settings)./li liYou can use strongAssistive Touch/strong (Settings  Accessibility) to lock and turn off the phone./li /ul  But really, you should strongtake it into an Apple store/strong, so they can deal with the underlying problem of your broken button!  <answer76816> I have the same problem with my iPod touch. In settings, go to "General""Accessibility" and turn AssistiveTouch on. You will have a little square with a circle appear on your screen. tap that to open it up, and there will be a lock screen button. Press and hold this, and just like with the lock button, the "slide to power off" will appear. Good Luck!  Of course now you cannot power it back on as you have no power button... I had the same problem... Just connect the iPhone to your charger and it will power the phone back on.  <comment54314> Just take out the battery - oh wait... <comment273544> Enabling Bold Text under General  Accessibility will also restart the phone. <comment355083> @user165604 worked great! Also gives your iphone a new fresh look with bolded text
