Is there way to keep same Navigator on every tab in Xcode? <body> I'd like to keep same view on Xcode Navigator on every tab.  On default setup, when I change tab, Navigator changes corresponding to that tab and shows different Navigator view.   For example:  I'm in Project Navigator in one tab. And when clicking another tab, Navigator shows Issue Navigator. This feature drives me crazy cause usually project tree stays put in editors.  So is there any way to change this behaviour so Navigator is same on every tab?
