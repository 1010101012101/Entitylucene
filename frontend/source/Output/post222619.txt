Using sqlite browser to extract OSX contacts <body> This is following up on this previous useful answer; I'd have left a comment there if i had the rep(:  In case you have the same questions i did:  First, i had to strongrename/strong  codeAddressBook-v22.abcddb/code to end with a code.db/code suffix before i could get my sqlite DB browser (Version 3.8.0) to recognize it as a SQLite database, even though sqlite3 could open it from the command line.    Second, the biggest hassle i had was figuring out the data model used in this database.  For me, the DB Browser GUI made fishing around across the tables worth the effort.  ul liThe primary integrating table is codeZABCDRECORD/code (Why did Apple have to add codeZABCD/code to all table names?!)/li liThe name of the other tables' attributes which allow them to be joined varies, eg:  precodeLEFT JOIN ZABCDPOSTALADDRESS ON ZABCDPOSTALADDRESS.ZOWNER = ZABCDRECORD.Z_PK LEFT JOIN ZABCDEMAILADDRESS ON ZABCDEMAILADDRESS.ZOWNER = ZABCDRECORD.Z_PK LEFT JOIN ZABCDNOTE ON ZABCDNOTE.ZCONTACT = ZABCDRECORD.Z_PK /code/pre/li /ul  Note that while I'm able to get existing Contacts data in these tables, I haven't found anyway to have Contacts take up any subsequent edits to the sqlite database.  @bmike suggests using vCard import/export, and that is certainly a workaround.   <comment269805> Sorry I can't help with your question however I wanted to say thanks for turning me on to [DB Browser for SQLite](http://sqlitebrowser.org). <comment271310> I don't think you can achieve anything on working on the `.abcddb` because this is a database which is built by `Contacts` from its internal data which is the `Metadata` directory. <comment278038> Welcome to Ask Different. What specifically are you looking to modify? Exporting data as vCard and manipulating that file and then importing is the fastest way I know to make bulk changes to the database. That [code is well documented](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vcf) or you could import into a simplified sqlite database schema if you needed. Also - if you could stick to one question per question, that works best here. <comment278243> hey @bmike, i was pursuing the contacts' `.abcddb` -- sqlite connection. (if i was starting over, i'd probably use vCards as you suggest.)  yes, i can import into sqlite, but it seems impossible to round-trip.  that comes close to the 'answer' i wish i'd had.  tell me how you'd like this editted to conform and i'm happy to oblige. <comment278256> Everything after the code block needs do to go I think. Modifying contacts app to use a different schema is too broad IMO. Basically, can you specify a more narrow end goal?
