Automator - Indesign file and folder creation, naming & editing from Spreadsheet <body> I'm fairly new to Automator, just learning some of the basics right now, but I have a big project, and I'd like to know if it's feasible with Automator. Basically our company needs to create files and a folder structure for orders from a spreadsheet.  For each order, I want Automator to create a few folders, name them, then create 2 separate InDesign files and name those. The names will be created from several different lines of a spreadsheet.  I would then like Automator to edit the Indesign files, adding text from the spreadsheet to both, as well as draw a box (size from the spreadsheet) and center it in one InDesign file.  I would also like Automator to provide me with options before I begin, to define separate variables.  Can all this be done with Automator? For InDesign it looks like it's possible to use this: https://itunes.apple.com/cn/app/id-automator-action-pack/id506566351?l=en&amp;mt=12  I'd appreciate any advice anyone could give.  <comment197865> Well, your right about it being a big project. Your not only limited by your knowledge but by the power of Automator as a drag-n-drop tool. Anything out-side of their drag-n-drop options will have to be done with code. This absolutely can be done sure, there's not much you can't do with a computer since we are the ones who tell them what to do, but if your talking in reference to numbers, there isn't that many automator drag-n-drop resources that means you will have to learn AppleScript or shell script or something to get this done. Excel has some drag-n-drop tools available however
