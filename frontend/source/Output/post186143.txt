Unable to connect internet from any browser but chrome <body> I am on OSX Yosemite 10.10.3 on MacBook Pro (Early 2011) and I am not able to connect to internet from any browser except chrome. I am not even able to ping from terminal as well. Please help.  When I try to use diagnostics Internet and Server shows Red, rest all are Green.   <answer186146> open network preferences and:  verify Ip   verify gateway  verify dns  -- your either static or dynamic. static; you put the info in, dynamic your network/router/gateway provides the correct ip info.  open terminal and type  precodeifconfig -a  /code/pre  that will show you your interfaces. One of these is your primary route. your can only have one default gateway. even though you have ethernet and wireless and firewire etc,... only one Real default way to go if the request is not local.  So check for default route by typing ;  precodenetstat -nr | more /code/pre  top two lines will tell you whos the boss.  then ping the gateway. if it doesn't work reboot try again. you should at a min ping gateway and DNS before i start looking at applications. -x  <answer187781> I had to reinstall Yosemite. Able to connect properly now.  <comment219715> You mean a simple "ping google.com" does not work ? what does it say ? <comment219885> Nope. Simple "ping google.com" does not work either.  Pravins-MacBook-Pro:~ pravinhmhatre$ ping google.com ping: cannot resolve google.com: Unknown host <comment219893> all is fine, but does not explain why Chrome is working and the others not! <comment219894> I am able to ping gateway which is 192.168.0.1 and DNS which is 103.17.159.50 <comment219896> @Pravin that would be your Router. Did you check the settings of your router so it is not blocking stuff. <comment219981> I tried connecting from different network and even from mobile hotspot. Still same issue.. :( <comment219983> @Pravin well it looks like some think this is the correct answer! does it work for you? <comment220568> I had to reinstall Yosemite. Able to connect properly now. <comment261346> Same exact problem happened after I installed El Capitan. I noticed that my root certificate is untrusted, but I'm not sure if that's at all relevant to the problem. Network preferences does not appear to have a "verify IP" option. I'll try harder.
