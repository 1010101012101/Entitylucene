Problems using the ZTE Data Card AC2737 <body> I use a MacBook Air with the Mountain Lion(10.8.1). After upgrading from Lion, my Reliance Data card which is a ZTE AC2373 has stopped connecting. Is there a solution?  What data cards work with this operating system? CN  <comment75819> All caps are frowned by our community.

This was not happening when I was using the LION OSX 10.7 version.
