Zipping the CONTENT in multiple folders <body> ) I have 48 folders, each containing a number of pictures. I need to create zip files for the CONTENT in each folder (NOT the folder it self!!). I have an Automator script that can create Zip files from the folder, but is there any way I can add something to that so it creates zip files from the content. I am trying to avoid selecting the files, right-click and Compress file. I have just upgraded to Sierra so I cant find the actual script but it is called Compress Folders separately I am working OS Sierra   OR ANY OTHER SOLUTION IS WELCOMED :-D ... thanks  <comment333155> Are you saying that you want to create an individual zip file of each file within the target folder vs one zip file containing all the files within the target folder? Also the script you were referring to, was it the one I wrote in this answer http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/225241/batch-compress-multiple-folders-into-individual-zip-files/225312?s=2|0.4212#225312 ?
