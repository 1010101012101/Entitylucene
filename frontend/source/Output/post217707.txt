Is there fuser -k <PID> analogue for Mac OS? <body> I want to kill process that runs at some port. In ubuntu I used fuser -k 8000/tcp. What is the Mac OS way?  I found out this way:  precodelsof -i tcp:8000 kill -9 /code/pre  But it's very long. I need one short command like fuser  Thanx  <answer217722> Save this in some file that is in your codePATH/code, call it codekill-server/code for example. Make sure to codechmod +x/code on it.  precode#! /bin/bash  lsof -i tcp:8000 | grep -v PID | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill /code/pre  Then invoke it with codekill-server/code or whatever you decided to call it. This is about as short as it gets.  <comment263183> lsof -i :8000 tcp:8000 + kill -9. But that are two non-short commands. I wanna one short. <comment263184> I don't know if apple uses a bash shell, but if that is the case the question is relevant here.. <comment263185> But this question already has an answer [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9168392/shell-script-to-kill-the-process-listening-on-port-3000) <comment263186> Mac OS X does use `bash`, but that's irrelevant to the question.
