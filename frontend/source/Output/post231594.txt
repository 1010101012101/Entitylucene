How do I block a website on my iPhone 5? <body> Like how you put code127.0.0.1 example.com/code in the codehosts/code file on a real computer.  <answer231618> To block a website on iOS 7 or later, go to codeSettings &gt; General &gt; Restrictions &gt; Enable Restrictions/code then codeRestrictions &gt; Websites &gt; Limit Adult Content/code then codeRestrictions &gt; Websites &gt; Never Allow &gt; Add a Website/code and add the website you wish to block.  <comment327948> This doesn't just block the one site it blocks all kinds of sites including stackexchange <comment327954> @gman If there's a website that gets blocked that you don't want to get blocked, just add it to the `Always Allow` list. <comment328101> I don't want to have to add 1000s of sites. When I enabled that option pretty much every site I tried to go to failed. Sites that had nothing to do with adult content. Sites that were google results to normal places, restuarnts, stores, events, etc... <comment328158> That sounds like Apple went overboard with the restrictions. I now see people with similar issues dating back to as early as 2014. Do you think you could post a question here describing it? There are a few people here that would see it and probably know what the issue is or know a workaround.
