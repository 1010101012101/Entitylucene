‘Web Sharing’ won't turn off <body> I'm trying to turn off the strongWeb Sharing/strong service from the Preferences panel, but everything I try, it just gets stuck on ‘Interrupting...’, with an orange icon, and it doesn't do anything. If I close the Preferences panel and come back, I find it turned on again.   (I reckon that it's not stopping due to the missing code/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.apache.httpd.plist/code, because when I try to stop it using the terminal, with codesudo apachectl stop/code, I get an error that says that it can't find that file)  What could I do to fix it?   <answer30111> Perhaps try codesudo killall httpd/code? I'd also check Console to see if there's any errors.  <answer30116> If you're missing launch daemons from your /System/ folder, the best long-term solution is to perform an Archive and Install so that you keep your content and simply rebuild your damaged operating system.  <answer53775> Did you delete /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.apache.httpd.plist?  If so, either replace it with a copy from another Mac (so it can be disabled properly), or reboot the computer (since it doesn't exist, it won't get loaded on reboot).  <answer55066> The only way to fix it was to reinstall OS X.  <comment34671> It kills just my own Apache server (installed separately) but not the built-in one! :(
