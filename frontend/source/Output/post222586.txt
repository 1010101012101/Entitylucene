Xcode 7.2 on 10.11.2 gets system integrity protection <body> I'm trying the first project/example (an "Empty Window app) from Neuburg's "iOS 9 Programming Fundamentals with Swift". In Xcode 7.2, on Mac OS 10.11.2, I Project - Run. The simulator opens, and I see a progress bar, but after a little bit, I get an error stating something like "couldn't attach to process due to system integrity protection". Searching, I see disabling as an out, but I'd like to stay as legal/normal as possible. What might I try to avoid the error? Thanks.
