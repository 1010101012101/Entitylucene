Why does my USB hub hide a directly attached drive from the boot menu? (post-Filevault) <body> I recently enabled FileVault on both my mid-2012 Retina MacBook Pro and my external USB drive containing a Carbon Copy Cloner backup.  My external drive is attached directly to the MBP. I also have a powered USB hub attached to the MBP's emother/em USB port (no drives are attached to the hub).  Since enabling FileVault, I've noticed a peculiar behavior on the boot menu (holding option at startup):  ul liIf I leave the hub attached during startup, the CCC drive doesn't show up in the boot menu./li liIf I leave the hub unplugged during startup, the CCC drive shows up./li liSwapping the USB ports for the drive and hub changes nothing./li /ul  Any ideas what the cause of this might be?  (Side note: I've also noticed that both the internal recovery partition and CCC's recovery partition are missing from the menu. But that's apparently normal from what I've researched.)  <answer249136> Its because the hub is able to connect drives so the hub shows it similar to how an empty optical drive shows up.
