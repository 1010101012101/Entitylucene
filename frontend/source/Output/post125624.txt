How to boot OSX into desktop from single mode? <body> Is there any possibility to boot graphical mode once I'm in single mode (CMD+S on boot time) logged as root?

But note that you will not be logged in as root, it'll take you to the normal login screen. If you want to log in as root in GUI mode, you'll need to set a root password (which you can do in single-user mode with the command codepasswd root/code).  <comment161791> Simply `passwd` also works
