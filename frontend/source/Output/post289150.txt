How do I create a 'series' of iBooks not originally purchased as a series from the iBooks Store? <body> Is it possible to create a series of iBooks from epubs not donwloaded from the iBooks store?   For example, I have all the series of "Game of Thrones" in epub format (not purchased from the iBooks Store), but when I synchronise these books in iTunes to my iPhone or iPad, they appear in a different order and do not appear as a series (e.g. Book 1, Book 2, Book 3 etc).  Is there any way to make these books appear in a series as per the image below? strongNote:/strong I did check this post, but it didn't work for me.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TnOOl.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment366383> Have you looked at Calibre?
