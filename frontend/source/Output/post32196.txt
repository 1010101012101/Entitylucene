Time Machine Backup to a Windows computer <body> Is it possible to do a time machine backup from a MacBook Pro to a Windows 7 PC? (i.e. use Windows 7 as a time capsule)  <answer32231> There was a lifehacker article on doing exactly this by creating a sparse HFS+ bundle on the Windows machines.  You could use a Linux machine or Amazon S3 using s3fs + encfs too.   Time Machine requires an HFS+ filesystems backup disks like this sparse bundle because Time Machine uses Apple's unusual directory hard links.  Linux could theoretically read the HTF+ sparse bundle but Windows sounds doubtful.   <comment36955> I really liked the xkcd comic :-) nice touch! <comment36996> Yes, it seemed appropriate.  :)
