Encfs volume randomly unmounts <body> I have an encfs volume that used to be mounted continuously without any issues.  Some months ago, the volume started occasionally become unmounted - even if there were open files on it!  This unmounting stopped after a few weeks, but yesterday again started happening again. I haven't changed the mount command from the time it was working well.  Any ideas what may be causing this and how to resolve?
