What is the purpose of the animation when tapping the temperature in the weather app? <body> When I tap the temperature (or anywhere else above the today slider) in the weather app, the temperature goes slightly dim and all subsequent information shifts upwards by a few pixels. After about 1 second, the app reverts to normal. What is the purpose, if any, of this?  Before iOS 8, tapping the temperature used to reveal details such as humidity and pressure (now at the bottom of the app). Is this perhaps a remnant of that animation? That seems unlikely, as we are currently 3 major updates past iOS 7 (iOS 10.1.1 at the time of posting).   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kWfV7.gif" alt="Animation of change"  <comment329190> Have you reported this bug to apple? <comment329191> I'm not sure if it is a bug, or if it serves a purpose that I'm not yet aware of.
