OS 10.8.5 - Finder craziness in one user account on iMac <body> I have created three main user accounts on my new iMac. Two of them are running glitch-free, but the last one is acting up. Most noticeably, the Finder indicator in the dock turns on and off sporadically. When I attempt to force quit/relaunch it, the menu shows one Finder listing that is constant, and another that also flashes on and off.  I have deleted the user and created new ones, hoping that would remedy the issue, but it continues to happen. It prevents any of the installed apps from working.  Any suggestions to remedy this are greatly appreciated!  <comment121650> Any differences between the three accounts (like admin/non admin, parental controls etc)? <comment121755> Any logs entries in the Console app that could help? Console can be found in /Applications/Utilities/
