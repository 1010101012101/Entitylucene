Installing bbcp on OS X Yosemite <body> I'm trying to install bbcp (which is a fast scp alternative) on MAC, I tried with brew:  precode$ brew install bbcp Error: No available formula for bbcp ==&gt; Searching formulae... ==&gt; Searching taps... homebrew/head-only/bbcp /code/pre  It looks like the bbcp binaries are not available for OS X! Any idea how to port them?   <answer206059> There is no need to port it. bbcp for OS X is available here. After downloading and moving it to an appropriate folder (e.g. /usr/local/bin) modify ownership and make the file executable.  Version number is: 15.02.03.01.1
