Websites stuck in infinite redirect loop after upgrading to iOS 5 (5.0.1) <body> Ever since upgrading my iPhone to iOS 5 (currently at 5.0.1), I've noticed that a few websites that I regularly visit get stuck in a constant redirect loop and never show up.  It's only sites that require logging in as a first step. The two sites that I can think of off the top of my head where this happens are:  ul liOreilly Books Online (Safari)/li liFT.com/li /ul  Though I have seen this on more than just these two sites.  Has anyone else encountered this problem?  Is there anything I can do to try and resolve this on my phone (settings, cache clearing, etc.)?  Or do I have to wait for an OS update or the sites to make a fix?  Also, I'm on the O2 network in the UK, but I can reproduce the behaviour through a VPN and on WiFi.  <answer33231> To clear Safari's cache:  Go to strongemSettings App  Safari/em/strong then tap strongemClear History/em/strong and strongemClear Cookies and Data/em/strong.  Hopefully this will help you.  <comment38302> While this wasn't the root cause, it did uncover the root cause: somehow my "Accept Cookies" setting got set to "Never" after the upgrade. I had an old auth cookie, and the sites kept trying, unsuccessfully, to update it.  Once I cleared that setting, everything worked fine.
