How do I get non default calendars to show up on iOS (iPhone/iPad)? <body> I was able to connect my iPhone to multiple Google accounts and have the default calendars show up on my iPhone and iPad correctly.  But how do I get the non default google calendars to show up as well?  <answer38153> Apparently there is a secret URL you have to visit to check off which calendars you want to appear on your iOS device.  https://calendar.google.com/calendar/iphoneselect  <comment43199> Is your question about syncing calendars or displaying them?  Are you seeing stagnant entries for those non-default calendars on your iOS device or are you not seeing the calendars at all? <comment43202> @jaberg removed the syncing wording to prevent confusion. the non default calendars don't even appear. I actually found the answer.
