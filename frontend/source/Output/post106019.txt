Mission Control switching to wrong Space on revealing hidden app <body> I've got some Stickies windows open in two separate Spaces. If I hide Stickies in one space with kbdâŒ˜ cmd/kbd+kbdH/kbd, then move to the other space and reveal Stickies with the app switcher, it springs back to the previous space before showing the app. I don't want this behaviour - I have Stickies windows in both Spaces, so it should just reveal the app in the current Space.  Same behaviour with all apps and in OSX 10.8.5 and 10.9. I have codeStickies dock icon contextual menu &gt; Options &gt; Assign to &gt; None/code set. Under codeSystem Preferences &gt; Mission Control/code I have "When switching to an application, switch to a space with open windows for the application" unchecked.  Is this a bug? If so, is there a way to work around it?  <comment124770> The same thing happens to me with other applications as well, so it does seem like a bug.
