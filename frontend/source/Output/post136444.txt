iPhone 5 will not sync with iTunes <body> I've had my iPhone 5 for quite some time now and I have been able to sync with iTunes no problem in that time period.  However, lately when I plug my iPhone 5 in, it doesn't even show up in my devices. All my iPhone 5 does is charges.  I've read several solutions across many websites and every one of them lead to a dead end.  ul liI quit and restarted iTunes;/li liI switched cords;/li liI switched USB ports;/li liI restarted my computer;/li liI restarted my iPhone/li /ul  My iTunes, iPhone, and computer are updated to their current versions.  I just cannot sync the iPhone with my computer. I'm running out of options.
