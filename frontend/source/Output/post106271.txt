can farming simulator 2013 be run on macbook air, both 11 inch and 13 inch? <body> I would like to ask if the game farming simulator 2013 can be run in both the mac book air 11 inch and 13 inch? This is because i am intending to get a mac book air next year, and the game in question.  <answer106276> I would think it should run fine on either...  the game has very low system requirements.
