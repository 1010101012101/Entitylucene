Font Used in OS X 'Yosemite' Version of Terminal's Icon? <body> What font is used for the prompt ('_') in Terminal's icon in OS X 10.10.x 'Yosemite?'    <answer155987> You can find a font from image in websites like WhatTheFont.  Just take an screenshot of the terminal icon and look for it.  Having only one symbol, I believe that can be difficult to find out.  <answer156066> The font used in the version of Terminal's icon included with OS X 10.10.0 'Yosemite' has been identified here on WhatTheFont! as 'Menlo,' the same font used by default in Terminal's own shells.    <comment183474> What makes you think it's any different from the font of the previous Terminal ? <comment183476> This could be it - https://github.com/andreberg/Meslo-Font/downloads <comment183527> OK, I've asked the guys at 'WhatTheFont!' about this question [here](https://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/forum/case/780103/?flush=1). <comment183574> I got an [answer](https://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/forum/case/780103/) at [WhatTheFont!](http://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/), so I'm going to post that as the answer to this question, all right? <comment183576> All right, that's been done, but I can't accept it as an answer for another 21 hours (cue the Jeopardy songâ€¦)
