Can I force finder to open without loading previous files? <body> Finder crashed recently and I had to force quit it. Problem is that now when I open something with it, all of the files that it had open previously (including the one that caused the crash) try and open, and it crashes again. Is there a way to force Finder to open (one time only) as a clean slate?  <answer91276> Try deleting the savedState directory:  precoderm -r ~/Library/Saved\ Application\ State/com.apple.finder.savedState/ /code/pre  When I tried running codekillall -kill Finder/code, that worked, but codeopen -Fa Finder/code or command-clicking Finder's Dock icon didn't.  You could also try to:  ul liDisable code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Finder.plist/code by temporarily moving it somewhere else./li liCause a kernel panic with codesudo dtrace -w -n 'BEGIN{panic();}'/code. There is normally an option to disable restoring state after kernel panics./li liTemporarily unload the launchd agent with codelaunchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.Finder.plist/code. There is normally a dialog about restoring state after crashes, but maybe it's not shown if the program is opened by launchd./li /ul  <comment107195> Why not just close them then? <comment107196> Finder hangs as soon as it tries to open the files, because one of the past files caused it to crash. <comment107198> Tried all three - still loading up everything including the crashed file. Thanks for your help though. <comment107201> I edited the post to add three more things you could try. If there are any relevant log messages, you could also edit the question to include them.
