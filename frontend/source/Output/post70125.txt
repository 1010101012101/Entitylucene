Set Spanish Layout to an external keyboard <body> I am using my Macbook Pro with an external display, and a external mouse and keyboard.  This is a Microsoft wireless keyboard 800 with Spanish layout. Is it possible to reconfigure the keyboard to set a spanish layout? because, the OS autoconfigure to English layout (same as on Macbook)  <answer70140> Usually, to make the OS match your keyboard, you go to strongSystem Preferences / Language &amp; Text / Input Sources/strong and check the box for what you want, in your case you should try emSpanish ISO/em or perhaps emSpanish/em.   Checking emShow Input Menu in Menu Bar/em will display a emFlag/em menu at the top right of the screen, under which you'll be able to select between your preferred keyboard layouts.  If neither emSpanish ISO/em nor emSpanish/em match your hardware, you can make a custom layout using Ukelele  Whatever layout you choose, it applies to both internal and external keyboards.
