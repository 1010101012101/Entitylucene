External Hard Drive last used / files copied on another computer? <body> I have an external hard drive (called SEAGATE Expansion Portable Drive) and I was wondering if there is any way I can tell whether this hard drive has been plugged into another computer any time in the past month?   It went missing and then turned up again. I would like to check whether it has been plugged into another laptop and had any files copied without my knowing - is there any way I can check this??  Thanks!  <answer275962> In short, No.br There's no way to be absolutely certain.  Files could have been copied from it, the entire drive could have been cloned without leaving a trace.    You can have a look at the Last Opened data, but it's not conclusive proof of a negative.br You'd have to check a folder at a time [Search ought to be able to do it, but it never seems to work properly other than on "This Mac" which would show you too much other data]    Open a folder on the drive, set it to View  As List.br Right click the columns bar at the top &amp; add Date Last Opened.br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tDcn0.png" alt="enter image description here"br Click the new column to sort on it.br Check folder by folder...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rp7Qf.png" alt="enter image description here"  Of course, anything you have opened since will confuse the results.  <comment347246> Okay, thanks, all of the last opened data seems as it should be - so I'm guessing either it has been cloned / copied as you said or I am just being mega paranoid!
