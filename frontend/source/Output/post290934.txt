How to connect to a Windows 7 PC from Sierra? <body> I have a Windows 7 Pro PC and want to share its drives so my Mac with Sierra installed can see it.  The PC is named "PC", it's on a workgroup called "WORKGROUP" and the only user on it is called "Tim" and this user has never had a password created for it. The Windows username is therefore PC\Tim. I checked the Guest account also and it's enabled now.  I went to the root of the drive I want to share and set the codeEveryone/code user to have FULL CONTROL. I set up codeadvanced sharing/code so that the drive was shared from root and has "everyone" as "full control". This is how I want it.  On my Mac I want to connect to it via its IP address. I open the "Connect to Server" box and type in codesmb://192.168.1.106/code.  This prompts with the "connect as" box but I can't get past it. I've tried selecting Guest which goes to the "problem connecting" screen. I've tried the names codetim/code, codeTim/code, codepc\tim/code, codePC\Tim/code and none of these work.  I tried setting up a new account on the Windows 7 PC, called "MAC". It has a password, which is MAC. I added the user MAC as full control on the root of the drive I want to share. I added the user MAC permission in the codeadvanced sharing/code screen and ensured that it had full permissions.  The prompt still refuses to authenticate the users.  Note: I also tried connecting to codecifs://192.168.1.106/code.  So. Is Sierra Mac just no longer able to connect to Windows computers?  strong/edit/strong  I've noticed this error message in the console during the time it's tryign to authenticate. I've also confirmed that YOSEMITE will connect just fine: This only affects SIERRA.  precodeRPC to srvsrvc gave error 0x16c9a034 /code/pre  Googling this leads to a rather unhelpful Apple article.  <comment367276> Maybe try this - https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/152900/share-mac-files-yosemite-with-windows/152906#152906 <comment367383> Nope. For me this has FIXED Yosemite connecting to Windows 7, but Sierra is still unable to connect. <comment367465> Here the Win7 share works right out of the box - with nothing (or the defaults) set in Win7's Local Security Policy  ... "Network security: LAN manager authentication level" <comment370635> Upgraded Sierra to 10.12.6. One of the fixes was "connecting to smb shares". Has had no effect - still broken. :-/
