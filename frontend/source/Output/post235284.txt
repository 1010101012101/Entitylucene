Grey Clouds on iPad photos <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OQLMi.png" alt="Here is Kik"(Sorry, the Instagram photo is apparently too big to upload. Basically its got the same cloud as the one in the Kik picture) On Instagram, when I go to post a photo, all of my photos have grey clouds in the bottom right corner and they're slightly blurry. This happened when I updated my iPad. Since then, I have also noticed that on Kik, my photos show up as grey boxes with the same cloud in the bottom right corner. On Vine, the photos now show up but are also blurry like on Instagram. I've tried figuring out what's wrong but I have no clue, other than maybe it being related to iCloud. Update: Now my Dropbox is playing up too. Only 140 photos are loaded out of 900, and the rest have just disappeared, like they've been deleted. This is extremely frustrating for me as I use Dropbox a lot, and I've deleted and reinstalled the app as well as searched in the Dropbox help section.  <comment288589> Can you take some screenshots and add them to your question, please? <comment293534> It sounds like you might have iCloud photos enabled. I don't use iCloud photos or Instagram, so I'm not entirely sure, but that's what it sounds like. Basically, what it lets you do is keep all your pictures in iCloud and your phone downloads them when it needs to, so it doesn't use up all of the space on your phone. <comment293535> Is the setting `Settings  Photos & Camera  iCloud Photo Library` enabled?
