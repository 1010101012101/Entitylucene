script copy sender(s) email address only to the clipboard <body> I am a blind voiceover user of mac.   The new codeMail.app/code makes it difficult to copy the sender's email. I would like to have a script which copies the sender email only, of one or more selected messages.   Is it possibile ?  <answer118767> Yes, AppleScript makes it easily possible !   Here is an AppleScript which can do that :   precodetell application "Mail"     set theSenderList to {}     set theMessages to the selected messages of message viewer 0     repeat with aMessage in theMessages         set end of theSenderList to sender of aMessage     end repeat     set the clipboard to (theSenderList as rich text)     beep end tell /code/pre  It will cop the mail senders to the clipboard as following: codeJohn Doe &lt;John.Doe@gmail.com&gt;/code  hr  The same script without the names :   precodetell application "Mail"     set theSenderList to {}     set theMessages to the selected messages of message viewer 0     repeat with aMessage in theMessages         set end of theSenderList to (extract address from sender of aMessage)     end repeat     set AppleScript's text item delimiters to " "     set the clipboard to (theSenderList as string)     set AppleScript's text item delimiters to ""     beep end tell /code/pre  It outputs only the addresses with a codespace/code delimiter : codejohn.doe@gmail.com jane.doe@gmail.com/code  hr  For the beep, just add codebeep/code before the codeend tell/code (as I already did above).   <answer118872> Two possible modifications to the very useful code by Matthieu:br     1. You could have it speak each address as it finds it (if that is useful) by using the codesay/code command.br     2. Some consider it good form to preserve what codeAppleScript's text item delimiters/code were before changing them, then restore them back to original settings, instead of assuming that was a null character (code""/code), especially if this might run while other scripts are running, since it is a global property.   precodetell application "Mail"     set theSenderList to {}     set theMessages to the selected messages of message viewer 0     repeat with aMessage in theMessages         set oneAddress to extract address from sender of aMessage         set end of theSenderList to oneAddress         say "found: " &amp; oneAddress     end repeat     set {prevDelims, AppleScript's text item delimiters} to {AppleScript's text item delimiters, " "}     set the clipboard to (theSenderList as string)     set AppleScript's text item delimiters to prevDelims end tell /code/pre  <comment138520> excellent, it works just as needed. is it possible to have a smaller version which copies only the sender's email without the name? i am really new to the apple scripting ? <comment138524> Yes, see my update ! <comment138537> excellent, i associated a keyboard shortcut and it works just fine. if it is not a problem do you think that it can make some kind of a sound or bip just to allert that the operation is fine ? <comment138538> See my new update ;) <comment138695> tahnk you very much, both scripts are excellent and finally i can work well with the header area which is not very screenreader friendly. both scripts work well with multiple messagges as well. thank you.
