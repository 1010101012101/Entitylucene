Different sounds to external speakers and headphones? <body> I'm often playing music from iTunes on a Bluetooth-connected speaker - usually something my wife is listening to.  I would like to watch a video in Safari simultaneously, listening to the audio on my headphones.  Is there a third-party program that will let me send the audio from iTunes to my speaker over Bluetooth, and the audio from Safari to my headphones?  EDIT: Using a 15" MBP running OS X 10.9.4.  <comment164711> Could you use the edit button to explain what hardware / OS + version you are using? There is iTunes and Safari for OS X, Windows and iOS as well as multiple versions of those OS.
