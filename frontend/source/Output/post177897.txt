How to switch to the day calendar with iOS 7 <body> I recently switched an iPhone from iOS 6 to iOS 7.1.2. Within iOS 6 I was using Calendar on the day display and week display mode continuously. It was easy to a point I can't even recall how I did this switching (we should take notes when we see an interface which is working nicely).  With iOS 7.1.2 I have a serious interface problem.  Within codeCalendar/code I am able to switch from an annual view to a month view with the codemonth name/code topleft red button. I discovered that I can also switch back to the month view by clicking on the codemonth name/code red header. But I can't see any way to switch to a day or week view. On the bottom left corner I have a codeToday/code red button, but it doesn't do anything.  What is the intelligent method to access the actual day calendar?  <answer177898> To toggle from month to week view, turn the phone sideways.  Day view is dependant on whether or not you have the list view on or off [highlighted in blue] If that's on, the day's events appear underneath the month. If it's off, tapping a day will take you to that day's view.  Once in Day view, the same button will then toggle between single day &amp; list of upcoming events view.  strongMonth view/strongbr img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eKnxq.png" alt="Month View"  hr  strongWeek view/strongbr  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dVjPG.png" alt="Week view"  hr  strongDay view/strongbr img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HRihj.png" alt="Day view"  hr  strongEvent list/strongbr img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ims6X.png" alt="Event list"  <comment210583> Thank you. I have the week one :)! Now for the day Calendar, do I have to rotate it around another axe? <comment210586> Day view is just the list under Month (the bit I scribbled out) - toggled by the icon in red on my first picture. Other than that, it's on your notifications drop-down. <comment210765> I'm sorry, but I don't "see" how to get the day Calendar. If you click on the `Today` button do you get to the Calendar of today? On my iOS 7.1.2, this button seems "dead". <comment210801> ach - my bad - updating answer. I've only just found it myself... <comment210813> I understood my blindness :). The day circled of red isn't just an emphasis of today. It is also a **button**. On the other hand the red `Today` isn't a button at all, it's just **emphasis**. I feel this confusion between emphasis and function isn't a real improvement. It looks like a nice confusion :(. <comment210815> BTW, thank you. Now I can exit of my "month view jail", even if I still don't see it (wrong interface design). <comment210818> I didn't like it to start with - but I guess it's just one of those things I got used to - so much so that actually I no longer look at the day view, I just use the list underneath Month.
