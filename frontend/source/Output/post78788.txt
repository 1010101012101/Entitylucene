Whenever I install a font using Font Book it copies a zero byte file into ~/Library/Fonts/ <body> But it still works if I manually copy fonts there. These empty files have the following permissions: code--wxr-xr-x    1 mcb  staff        0  7 Okt  2011 Lekton-Regular.ttf/code. What could be the problem here?  <comment91199> What Version of OS X are you using? Can you preview the actual font before installing with QuickLook and does it look okay? <comment91281> 10.8.2 Mountain Lion, and the font can be viewed with QuickLook. <comment91309> What are the permissions of the font(s) before you install them via Font Book? <comment186700> The same issue was encountered here I think: http://www.dmertl.com/blog/?p=11 <comment186747> @HighlyIrregular Thanks for the follow-up. I have upgraded to Yosemite since then and havenâ€™t encountered the problem again.
