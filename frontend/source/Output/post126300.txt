Unable to call FaceTime only to a particular caller ID <body> I am using iPhone 4 with iOS 6, and my boyfriend is using iPhone 5 with iOS 6 (recently upgraded to iOS 7).  Whenever I called him from my iPhone, it would say "Connecting..." when he picked up, and then after a few seconds it would say "Connection Lost". I tried a lot of times and it never worked.  Then I have my Mac setup with Facetime, and I was able to call his phone. And then I tried to use my iPhone to call my Mac (different ID), and it was connected. And then I tried to use my iPhone to call a friend's iPhone 4, and it also worked. So the problem is not on the iPhone.  So here's the summary:  ul liiPhone 4 calling iPhone 5 didn't work/li liMac calling iPhone 5 worked/li liiPhone 4 calling another iPhone 4 worked/li liiPhone 4 calling Mac worked/li /ul  Any idea?  <answer126313> FaceTime requires a very strong network connection, so I believe your issue has less to do with the device, and more to do with the type of connections you trying to use.  FaceTime works best with a solid wifi connection on both ends, or at least LTE. If either device is trying to use 3G or 4G, you will struggle to establish or maintain a decent connection.  To test this, I would ensure you are both on a good wifi connection and try it again to see how it works. If not, then you have deeper compatibility issues.  P.S. I would recommend upgrading your iPhone 4 to iOS 7.1. It has improved performance over 7.0.x and will help alleviate further compatibility issues.  <answer127290> I no longer have this issue. What I did before trying to call again was to delete /var/logs/AppleSupport/general.log which was 10MB in size. I don't know if this has any correlation with the failure of the calls. If anyone has similar issue maybe you can try removing this file (if your iPhone was jailbroken).  <comment147914> Can you call him been right next to him to test! <comment148461> We were both on a good wifi connection. Thanks for the comments, but I am not sure if upgrading to iOS7 will solve this issue because the call was already failed when he was on iOS6. I read some reviews that iOS7 is slower on iPhone 4 so I would try as much as I can to stay on iOS6. <comment148464> Does the same happens the opposite way, him calling you ? <comment148476> The initial release of iOS 7 did suffer performance issues on iPhone 4, but the recently released 7.1 is drastically better. I would recommend giving it a try. <comment148516> Yes, it happens the same way even when he was the one initiating the call.
