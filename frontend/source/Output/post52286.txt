How to fix iMac losing Wi-Fi connection again and again? <body> My iMac loses its Wifi connection from minute to minute. To make it active again, I have to run "emAssist Me.../em"  from the Network preferences panel.   This is really, really annoying.   Does anyone know what's going on?  I'm running Mac Os 10.7.4.  <answer54626> You may find that another device is causing interference such as a cordless phone or microwave, or even a neighbour's wifi device. Try changing the channel on your wifi router.  It may be worth using the "alt-trick" to check what's going on with your wifi - when your wifi is connected, mouse over the wifi icon in your system tray, hold down the codealt/code key then click on it. You should see some additional info, like the following:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mvwkS.png" alt="enter image description here"  Keep an eye on the Transmit Rate and RSSI; if they're poor it could be a sign that you need to change the wifi channel.  You can also use Lion's hidden diagnostic app to see what could be causing problems for your wifi.  <answer78945> My router settings were causing the problems for me.   The router was set to 11/strongB/strong/G/N Mixed mode, and as a result I had constant WiFi dropping. I then set the router to 11/G/N and I have not had a single drop.  <answer97135> Change your OS to either 10.6.8 or to 10.8.4  It will help  <answer210229> Perfect fix, just turn off IPv6. That was all my router connection needed!  <comment62561> Even if it looses connection you shouldn't have to rerun the Assistant. What happens if you just turn Wi-Fi off and on again in the menu? <comment113994> You need to add more details on how it works and why. <comment253720> Please add more information as to how and why this will help, including references on the internet that back up your assertion.
