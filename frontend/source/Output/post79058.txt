Cannot activate any programs except Chrome -> coreservicesd crash <body> I suddenly started experiencing an error in which Chrome is the only application that will accept any input. I can use the mouse to bring other windows to the front, but they will not accept keyboard input.  The Dock also won't accept input - I can't apple-tab between applications.  If I hide Chrome, it still accepts keyboard input!  Any ideas on what would cause this or what a solution might be?  (I will attempt the "close chrome, restart" workaround, but that doesn't qualify as a solution)  Closing chrome just revealed that the whole OS had crashed.  A little more research revealed others have experienced this: http://www.macsupportguy.com/viewtopic.php?f=26&amp;t=47208  The errors in my system.log include:  precodeJan 16 12:12:41 eta /System/Library/CoreServices/Dock.app/Contents/MacOS/Dock[195]: LaunchServices/5123589: coreservicesd is running an unsupported version, 0       ( we are 10600000 ), so we cannot talk to it.

The core of the crash may be this:  precodeJan 16 12:05:01 eta [0x0-0x17db7da].com.apple.systemevents[95826]: launchctl: CFURLWriteDataAndPropertiesToResource(/var/db/launchd.db/com.apple.launchd.perus      er.501/overrides.plist) failed: -10 Jan 16 12:10:02 eta loginwindow[70]: CarbonCore.framework: coreservicesd process died; attempting to reconnect but future use may result in erroneous behavior      .

However, it would be best to come up with a solution to recover the machine rather than restart it - I lost a lot of work in this random crash.
