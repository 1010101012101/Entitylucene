mac mini flashing mouse repetitive sound wont let me click on stuff <body> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5NeoGTkkZ4&amp;index=2&amp;list=PLTlfSplem0iX3CLphwxx5fPGD98ydgbpZ  okay so basically half a week ago my computer would start making weird sounds and not letting me click on anything. pretty sure that's not normal for macs, but anyway, i have searched long and hard for the solution tried restarting my computer, using all the computer repair tools built into the mac literally nothing has helped. now i have two main theories, either my computer has been cursed or hive a virus. no clue what to do.  any help at all would be very very very much appreciated Ps: i had to use someone else's computer to post this (yes it's that bad)     <answer259764> i eventually just decided to do a factory reset, it worked.  <comment323686> Have you tried resetting the PRAM and SMC? <comment323692> Yes i tried that, still not working <comment323713> Have you tried the hardware test? <comment323732> Do you have a bluetooth keyboard that has some things laying on them? This is the sound if keys being pressed down forever. <comment323877> no i do not have a bluetooth keyboard <comment325057> What's a "factory reset" on a Mac?  Do you mean wipe the drive and reinstall from scratch?
