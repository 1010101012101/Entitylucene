iPhone 4S restore from backup 64 GB to 16 GB <body> I am trying to restore a new 16 GB iPhone from my old 64 GB backup, and am getting the error message that the old backup is too large (for the record, I don't believe it's very much over 16 GB)...the old phone is broken, so I cannot try to make a new backup smaller (this was one solution I found here).  Any idea how I might go into the backup that is saved in iTunes and eliminate portions manually? Any help greatly appreciated. Thanks!  <answer101761> This is not possible within iTunes, which deals with backup and restore as a single block. Keep in mind that syncing apps is different from a backup and restore - so you could remove some apps to free up space and try the restore.  The backup is stored under code~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup//code, but the files not in an easy-to-use form.  If you wish to explore your backup and see what can be selectively extracted or used, there are some paid applications to do that (check the free trials to see if they're helpful):br iBackup Extractorbr iPhone Backup Extractor  Also see:br Processing iPhone / iPod Touch Backup Files on a Computer  <answer117200> You can restore a large iTunes iOS backup to another iOS device with less storage.
