Running a command line tool based on its extension <body> I use Leo for structured editing of my code, and Leo has the extension of .leo.  In order to run Leo, I use the following alias  pre alias leo='arch -x86_64 /usr/bin/python2.6 /Users/bin/Leo-4.7.1-final/launchLeo.py --gui=qt' /pre  It works well to launch leo with leo file as follows.  pre leo -f hello.leo /pre  However, I need to find a way to launch Leo by clicking the leo file in the Finder/Path Finder.   What might be the solution to this problem?  h2ADDED/h2  Mankoff's advice on using Automator works. For running PyQt with -f option, I set "Pass input : as argument", and have the following bash code, which launches with/without -f option depending a file is dragged on or not.  precodeif [ -z $1 ] then   arch -x86_64 /usr/bin/python2.6 /Users/smcho/smcho/bin/Leo-4.8-b1/launchLeo.py --gui=qt  else   arch -x86_64 /usr/bin/python2.6 /Users/smcho/smcho/bin/Leo-4.8-b1/launchLeo.py --gui=qt -f $1 fi /code/pre  <answer3951> I would use Automator. Make an app that takes an argument (file dropped on it, file double-clicked associated with that app, whatever), and runs the command you have above.  <answer4004> ul liRight click on a .leo file and select Get Info/li liOn the [whatever.leo] info pane that opens, use the Open With drop-down to browse to the Leo editor./li liClick the Change All... button/li /ul  Double clicking any .leo file should invoke the Leo editor from now on.
