Help with libxml2.2.dylib & libxml2.dylib <body> I realize this might be a common question.  Upon trying to resolve a dependency problem with libxml2.2.dylib I accidentally deleted files /usr/lib/libxml2.2.dylib and /usr/lib/libxml2.dylib. Yes, I wanted to make backup copies of those files, but unfortunatelly I overwrote those.  Is there any resource where I could obtain the said libraries for Mountain Lion?  Google Chrome stopped working, Firefox still works. I am afraid that if I close the machine I will be unable to start it again.  I've been searching Google for the past hour with no success. I don't have any other Apple devices to copy the file from.  I would really appreciate your help, Julius.  <comment106299> The version that I need it seems is 10.8.0 <comment106300> here take a copy of mine : http://demo.ovh.com/fr/cf57af2ed6689784867910e6763d1175/ They come from a 10.8.3 but it should not be a problem. <comment106303> You just saved my life. I honestly don't know how to thank you. Have a great day! <comment106321> You're welcome ;) <comment121808> Julius, Do you have a copy of /usr/lib/libxml2.2.dylib? I have the same problem as you, but Matthieu's link seems to be broken. I'd really appreciate that. <comment121820> Install the combo update for the version of OSX you have
