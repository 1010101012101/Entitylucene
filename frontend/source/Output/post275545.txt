How to write in Georgian on your iPhone? <body> I'm looking to write using the Georgian language script Mkhedruli on my iPhone. I can't find Georgian Mkhedruli on the keyboard options anywhere. Just in case you don't know what Mkhedruli is, it's the script which looks like this:  მე და სჰენ. ქართველი ენა ლამაზი.  Do you know how I can write this on my phone?  <answer275589> If you do a search for "Georgian" in the App Store you will find any number of apps, both free and paid, for adding a Mkhreduli keyboard to your iPhone.  Only having a passing familiarity with the script I couldn't give you any expert recommendation. Try a couple of the free ones.  <comment346641> Have you checked the App Store for keyboard apps that can do this? <comment346712> Try using this app https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/georgian-keyboard/id900035450?mt=8
