Run shell and type output <body> I am using iTerm2. I would like to have a keyboard shortcut which runs a command and types the output at the current cursor.  Example: I have a function embranchName/em which returns/prints the current folder's branch name. I want the branch name to be written to the shell (iTerm2) by pressing kbdcmd/kbdkbdB/kbd.  <answer242213> Open iTerm2 preferences and go to Profiles tab. Select your desired profile and go to Keys tab. Tap plus sign (+) and type the following:  ul liKeyboard Shortcut: kbd⌘cmd/kbd+kbdB/kbd/li liAction: Send Text/li liIn the next line add the following command: codegit name-rev --name-only HEAD\n/code/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/27IqP.png" alt="enter image description here"  After that, when you hit kbd⌘cmd/kbd+kbdB/kbd, iTerm send that command to your terminal and will return your current branch.  precode$ git name-rev --name-only HEAD master  /code/pre  <comment297857> May be this is of some use to you. http://askubuntu.com/questions/525482/how-can-i-assign-a-keyboard-shortcut-for-the-script-that-i-have-created <comment297863> what i want to do is this: 1. start typing: git push origin  2. press cmd b  I am expected to have: git push origin current-branch-here  This is just an example. <comment297865> what i want to do is this: 1. start typing: `git push origin` 2. press cmd b   I am expected to have: `git push origin current-branch-here`  This is just an example. <comment297866> i want the action to be run in background and the result to be outputed on the current cursor <comment297867> In this case, you can replace the text i suggest in the answer with `$(git name-rev --name-only HEAD)`. That command return your current branch. So, you type `git push origin `, then ⌘cmd+B and  you will have the command to execute: `git push origin $(git name-rev --name-only HEAD)`.
