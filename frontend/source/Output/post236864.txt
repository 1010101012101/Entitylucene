Also can you please show me how can I link the sublime text 3 to run python3, I am really new with python3 <comment289984> @LDbunny I'd suggest heading over to [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/sublimetext) for questions about Sublime Text. They'd be able to help you better. <comment289985> @AndrewLarsson Alright! Thanks
