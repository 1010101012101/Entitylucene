In Numbers, is there a way to get the row instead of the value when using a MAX or MIN Function? <body> In Numbers, is there a way to get the emrow/em instead of the emvalue/em when using a MAX or MIN Function?  For example, let's take this sheet:  precodebread  10 cheese 20 meat   35 /code/pre  What I am trying to do is to show the most expensive food by comparing all price values, getting the emrow/em number of the MAX value and then print the respective food on that line.   <answer214847> Using codeINDEX(MATCH)/code this can be easily accomplished.  h3Formulas/h3  This formula returns the food label:br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zm39g.png" alt="Min formula returning food label"  ul liThe strongINDEX/strong function returns the value in the cell located at the intersection of the specified row and column within a collection of cells or from an array returned by an array function.  /li liThe strongMATCH/strong function returns the position of a value within a collection./li /ul  This formula returns the Row number:br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ReoUM.png" alt="Row number function"  ul liThe strongROW/strong function returns the row number of the row containing a specified cell./li /ul  Replacing strongMIN/strong with strongMAX/strong returns the row with the Max result.br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/T4shy.png" alt="Formula results"  Further information on these functions can be found in the strongFunctions reference./strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HLJWQm.png" alt="Functions reference"
