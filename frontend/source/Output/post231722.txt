iPhone only lets one side of any earbuds work <body> I just bought new Samsung earbuds and plugged them into my iPhone 4. Only the right side works though. If they're new, why is only one side working? How do I fix my phone itself because I know that it's my phone that isn't working because these are like the 6th new earbuds I've bought that only works on the right side?  <answer231723> Double check that you don't have the left/right balance pushed to one side. The slider should be set right in the middle. This is in Settings  general  accessibility  hearing. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vljZm.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment283002> I wouldn't be surprised if this is a hardware issue: have you tried with another set of earbuds/headphones?
