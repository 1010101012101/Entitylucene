Office Outlook Mac 2016 - How to change the name displayed on my (sent) emails <body> I am struggling in order to change the name displayed in my (sent) emails with Office Outlook 2016 for Mac.  Firstly, I have tried to change the name going on codeTools-&gt;Accounts-&gt;Full Name/code but nothing happened. Secondly, I have tried to change the name on my Contact Card, through codeAddress Book/code, but again nothing.  The email account is an Exchange one and it belong to my University.  Any help?
