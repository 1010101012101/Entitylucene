How to renice by process name? <body> I am trying to Launch a process using NICE but this process is starting other process by itself and they are not affected by the priority of the main process ( main process has the correct nice but sub process priority is set to default)  So I am trying to renice those process while they run.br I tried  precode renice n -p $(pidof &lt;process name&gt;) /code/pre  but it is not recognised by MacOS (it is probably linux specific ?) so how can I do that?   you can find a related discussion here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30062340/starting-process-with-nice-command-macos-leaves-the-process-priority-at-0#comment48287323_30062340  thanks.  <answer186166> There are multiple correct answers, here an answer let suits your train of thought.  Run this oneliner:  precoderenice 10 -p $(ps -ax | grep -i [p]rocessname | awk 'NR==1{print $1}') /code/pre  What is does:  ul licoderenice 10/code, this will make your process run with the nicety of ten, the nicer, the higher the number./li licode-p/code expects the process id/li licodeps -ax/code lists all running processes with there name and codePID/code/li licodegrep -i [p]rocessname/code only matches the processes with 'processname', case insensitive. the brackets will prevent to match the codegrep/code process itself./li licodeawk 'NR==1{print $1}'/code will fetch the 1st instance (codeNR==1/code) of the first column (code$1/code)/li /ul  You already gave a good example of command substitution.   <answer186167> You can use codepgrep/code instead of codepidof/code on OS X. Using your example from earlier, the following should work:  precoderenice n -p $(pgrep &lt;process name&gt;) /code/pre  That said, a child started after the parent has had their priority changed emshould/em inherit the parent's priority.    <comment219729> :renice is not a command line program I don't think any begin with :  I suspect the format of that question is confusing - I have edited t to make it clearer <comment219744> Sorry for the typo, it is edited <comment219749> I see no need for downvotes. <comment219915> Yes... well It seems that After effect command line render starts aerenderCore as a "child" process. and it is not affected by the priority of its parents. I still have to test you code line, I'll be back!
