How can you forward long headers in Apple Mail 8.1 using Yosemite (needed when reporting suspected fraud) <body> also wondering if any way to have a return of incoming mail being individually numbered as existed in mail used with 10.6.8  <answer159604> In Mail go to the View menu, and choose Customize Toolbar. In the toolbar customization interface, drag the button for “Show (or hide) all headers” to the toolbar. It has a small magnifying glass and a little piece of mail on it. Then just click on that anytime you want to reveal a long header.  <answer159642> Select View → Message → Raw Source (kbd⌥/kbd+kbd⌘/kbd+kbdU/kbd). This will display the full message (all headers included) in plain text as is received by the mail server.  <answer159747> To forward with all headers intact, for phishing/fraud reporting etc, usebr Message  Forward as Attachment.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eNkCd.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment187552> Where do you want the numbers to be? Next to each incoming message? I'm not aware of such a setting. <comment187718> Could you split these out into two separate questions. Otherwise they become un-Googleable for future seekers. <comment230296> that's not headers intact, that's placing all headers in another envelope. <comment230297> that's show, not forward. In all previous versions of Mail, if you were showing headers and clicked Forward it would forward the headers. This was removed in Yosemite. <comment230298> that's show, not forward. <comment230299> which gets them to the destination… intact. I'm not sure what your point is.
