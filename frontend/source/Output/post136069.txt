Make windows go completely off screen in "show desktop" hot corner <body> Is there anyway to have it so when I go to the hot corner I have set to show desktop, the windows go so far off screen that neither them nor their shadow can be seen?  <answer136134> That option is not available using the show desktop via hot corner.  <comment161337> I don't think so... <comment161451> just use spaces and go to another space by CTRL+rightarrow (CTRL+leftarrow to go back)
