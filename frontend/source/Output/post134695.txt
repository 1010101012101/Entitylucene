Why does the message icon show only for one number <body> In one of my contacts I have added two phone numbers. I want to know why the message icon that let's me text to this number show up only for one of the two numbers as well as how can I fix this. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/G4iD8.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer134700> Just change the phone number label strongWork/strong to strongmobile/strong or strongiPhone/strong.   Apple makes the assumption here that only mobile phones can get text messages which is sometimes wrong.   <comment159497> That worked. However, isn't it wrong that only the labels iPhone and work let me message? <comment159502> by work you probably meant mobile. Since non-mobile phones can also sometimes read/send text messages, yes it's kinda wrong ;)
