Notes.app crashing continuously in El Capitan <body> Since enabling iCloud sync for the Notes.app in a preview beta of El Capitan, the app started to crash every time I open it.   I've tried removing the plist file, the codecom.apple.Notes/code folder from code~/Library/Caches/code, and even the container, but the result is the same.  ol liHas anyone else run into this issue?/li liAny suggestions on how to fix it?/li /ol  emUpdate/em: the app crashed even when iCloud sync is disabled.  emUpdate 2/em: I've ended up doing a clean install. By now I'm convinced that once something went wrong when enabling iCloud sync, there's no good solution of fixing this issue.

/code/pre  <answer210430> I had the same issue but fixed it by:  ul lideselecting iCloud sync for Notes/li liopening Notes/li lireselecting iCloud sync/li /ul  So far so good...it crashed after ~5 sec before, now all appears well.  <answer211553> Same for me.  Under El Capitan, on one of my Macs, Notes crashes every time that I try to open it.  I tried turning off iCloud synch, but that did emnot/em help; Notes keeps crashing.  Next time I reboot, I will trying running Notes in Safe Mode -- for the first time only! -- to see if I then can open it up normally thereafter in regular mode.  Have you tried that, anyone?  <answer214165> Solution: Remove MS exchange account in internet accounts. Notes app will not crash upon opening then add your MS exchange account again.  <answer219566> In my case was Safari that closed randomly for weeks. I resolved it by doing the following  ol liDelete Safari with AppCleaner/li liMount OS X recovery partition with   precodediskutil mount Recovery\ HD hdiutil mount /Volumes/Recovery\ HD/com.apple.recovery.boot/BaseSystem.dmg cp -R /Volumes/OS\ X\ Base\ System/Applications/Safari.app /Applications /code/pre/li liInstall Pacifist then open OS X Installer and install Safari with Pacifist./li liIn iCloud disable Safari and then enable it  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/E3tkj.png" width="481"/li /ol  <answer228272> I had this issue with TextEdit and Preview. Deleting the com.apple.xxx files in ~/Library/Preferences/ and ~/Library/Components as suggested on other forums didn't help. At best it solved the issue for a couple of days.  Problem was coming from wrong permissions on some font files. Repairing permissions on the Fonts folder solved my issue. Open Terminal and type  precodesudo /usr/libexec/repair_packages --repair --standard-pkgs /Library/Fonts/ /code/pre  You will be asked for your password (sudo means get super user powers) Repairing permissions used to be available from the Disk Utility app but Apple removed it since Mavericks or Yosemite for some reason.  <answer238072> As with most of you, I just had the same issue.  I combined a couple of different suggestions (e.g., Capt G) from this thread to find a solution for me:  ol liOpen Internet Accounts/li liSelect the "Exchange" account if you have one set-up./li liUncheck the Notes app in the window to the left showing the apps associated with the Exchange account.  Keep this window open./li liOpen Notes.  Notes stayed open for me, with just the iCloud data available./li liClose Notes./li liNow, in the Internet Accounts window check the Notes app in the window to the left associated with the Exchange account./li liOpen Notes.  This time the Notes app stayed open for me with all my original data./li /ol  I hope this helps!  <answer249926> No solution from me.  Notes.app still crashes.  My issues seem to relate to fonts. The Font Repair process didn't fix it.  If I have an unusual font, it crashes.  If I change the first line of text to a Heading, it might crash.  If I try to print, it might crash.  Frequently it fails to pop-up the Print dialogue.  Moving to Evernote or equivalent.  <answer274624> Finally found a solution for this after months of trying various different things. (Tried pretty much every solution, individually or in combination). What finally worked for me was:  Making sure that all internet accounts had synching off for notes (including iCloud) in the system preferences Going to /users/[name]/Library and doing a search within that folder for any file containing “Notes” in the name. matches were found in both /users/[yourname]/Library/Containers AND /users/[yourname]/Library/GroupContainers going to /Library/Caches and selecting all and moving to trash Selected all such files, threw them in the trash. Empty trash Reboot Open Notes Turn on synching for iCloud  Presto! It worked! For the first time since I installed Sierra pretty much, it finally worked on my computer again! So I’m not sure which file it was exactly that I deleted that did the trick, but my best guess is that deleting the notes related files in “containers” is not enough, you must also go after the related files in “group containers”.  There we go! Hope this helps somebody else!  <comment254011> Unfortunately it still crashed but this time with a different stack trace. <comment255366> I suggest signing out of iCloud completely and rebooting your Mac after that. Check if that helps. <comment265548> Welcome to Ask Different!   As this does not answer the question (in this case, the OP was asking about issues with a Notes app, however your answer is in relation to Safari not working), I am flagging it for deletion. <comment315807> This fixed my issue after upgrading in Sierra <comment353218> You are life saver, your solution works like charm. Thank you.
