How to send 'print' key with RDC (Remote Desktop Connection)? <body> I use Microsoft's RDC on Mac. I need to click on print key to have some screen capture, but Mac Keyboard doesn't have one.  How do I send print key with Mac through RDC?  <answer25158> Try using the virtual keyboard windows has under the "accessibility" programs menu  <answer25159> The print screen command on a Mac is:  kbdShift/kbd+kbdCommand/kbd+kbd3/kbd   kbd⇧/kbdkbd⌘/kbdkbd3/kbd  So on Windows it would most likely be:  kbdShift/kbd+kbdControl/kbd+kbd3/kbd  kbd⇧/kbdkbdCtrl/kbdkbd3/kbd  <answer25278> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/paMit.png" alt="enter image description here"  The MS RDC has a preference menu so that you can customize the shortcuts.  <answer72363> Try kbdOption/kbd + kbdF4/kbd- it worked for me!  <comment28589> Sorry, but you can't just take any Mac command, change every ⌘ to ^, and *guess* that that is probably how it works on Windows. Such speculative answers are not useful. <comment188284> i am using RDC from the App Store on my MBA. I don't see this preference dialog in MS' RDC client. Please advise.
