Is there a terminal command to restart an application? <body> I am having issues with Adobe Dreamweaver on my Mac running Yosemite.  I will be in the middle of saving a file to my server and it just locks up. Nothing will happen after that. I try and force quit the application and it closes fine. However, when I try and re-open it, it just bounces.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBgQj_4fcIA  I have to restart the Mac 4-5 times a day because of this.  Is there a way to "clear" whatever is happening on a restart through a terminal command?  Its bad enough it locks up like this but if I could quickly clear the application from memory or cache; it would save a lot of time restarting.  <answer161471> You're using cs6 that uses Java 6 and Yosemite I believe is Java 8. You could try installing java 6 but it isn't supported and neither is DWcs6. Unfortunately that's the way of it. I don't know if you have a creative cloud account. They provide all updates. If not you could try the Java route or another FTP client. :/ Edit:: Correction. I forgot since o have to install Java for dev purposes. Yosemite doesn't come stock with it. BUT I found this. It may help. http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572?viewlocale=en_US&amp;locale=en_US  <comment188732> Did you try saving the file locally, to eliminate the server connection as a possible cause? <comment188770> I did not, would be kinda of a pain as a lot of it is server side so I like to see the changes in real time. I get that apps crash, but not being able to open it without restarting is very frustrating.
