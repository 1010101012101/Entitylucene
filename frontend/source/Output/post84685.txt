How can I fix a missing color in emacs? <body> I used homebrew to install emacs, replacing an older version of unknown provenance. At startup emacs complains codeUnable to load color "dark cyan"/code and some text in my elisp files is invisible: I see code(require '   )/code instead of code(require 'foo)/code.  There don't seem to be any references to dark cyan in my code.emacs.d//code files, so I think dark cyan must be part of the default scheme. How can I fix this?  <answer84686> After banging my head against the wall for a while, I found http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.macintosh.osx/6639     Delete this file:      ~/Library/Colors/Emacs.clr      and dark cyan should come back.   So I quit emacs, moved that file to code~/Library/Colors/Emacs.clr-/code, started emacs again... and it worked. I hope this fix is useful to someone else.
