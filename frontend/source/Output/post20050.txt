How to reload autofs on Lion without restarting? <body> I'm trying to get my host machine running Lion to automount an NFS export on my CentOS VM.  I was able to get this working on a system running Mac OS 10.5 by modifying code/etc/auto_master/code and then restarting the codeautofs/code service per the instructions in http://alanlam.blogspot.com/2008/06/restart-autofs-in-leopard-without.html:   pre sudo service com.apple.autofsd stop sudo service com.apple.autofsd start /pre   However, in Lion, the codeservice/code command appears to be missing.  How do I reload the codeautofs/code service in OS X Lion without restarting?  <answer20069> You can use codelaunchctl/code instead of codeservice/code:  precodesudo launchctl stop com.apple.autofsd /code/pre  You should not need to restart autofsdt manually; launchd will notice that it has stopped, and immediately start another instance.  <answer20688> this works for me:  precodesudo automount -vc /code/pre  <comment22758> Forgot about that; thanks!  I like this better, since it is a 'reload' operation rather than a 'restart'. <comment23647> Does launchtcl show the com.apple.autofsd as a job that is loaded? Launchd really should be controlling this for you and logging why and when a halt / respawn or error happens.
