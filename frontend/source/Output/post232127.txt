Customise Restrictions passcode on iphone <body> I know you can customise the iPhone main passcode to strengthen the security but there doesn't seem to be that option when doing the same when setting up restrictions. After I have written it down somewhere I don't want to remember the passcode, and I definitely will if't it only 4 numbers.  Is it possible to write an app for something like that?  <answer232129> Very much doubt Apple would allow any app to access that API.br The restrictions passcode is so hard you need to wipe the phone &amp; start over if you forget it.  If you really don't want to know what the code is, get someone else to set one &amp; not tell you what it is. You then have the opportunity of changing your mind later, assuming emthey/em remember it.
