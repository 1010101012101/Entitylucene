What's the easy way to convert all man pages to html? <body> Sixteen years into the 21st century I remain baffled that we still have to go out of our way if we want to see a man page  ul lirendered in a proportional font (that is, not Courier or similar)/li liwith links to other referenced pages/li /ul  There are tantalizing web sites with HTML man pages that have links, like this, but I haven't found such a site with pages updated for the current version of macOS. And of course a web site won't show man pages for software you've installed via Homebrew, etc.  Is there a solution to this problem? I've looked and looked. This  precodefunction manp {   man -t "$1" | open -f -a /Applications/Preview.app/ } /code/pre  renders a page and shows it in Preview (after you wait for a PostScript interpreter to convert it to PDF), but you don't get live links.  The man page for man says:     h3HTML PAGES/h3      Man will find HTML pages if they live in directories named as expected to be ".html", thus a valid name for an HTML version of the ls(1) man page would be /usr/share/man/htmlman1/ls.1.html.   I could write a script to convert all of the man pages everywhere on my system to HTML, but I bet someone has already done this. And I bet they have also solved the problem of rendering SEE ALSO references as links, which the man command apparently doesn't do.  <answer264913> Install Bwana which allows you to browse the codeman/code pages in your favourite browser.  To quote the page above "Just type "man:" followed by the man page you're looking for into your browser's URL field. Hit enter and let Bwana do the rest." It has live links.  <answer264929> bcat lets you pipe codestdout/code to your default browser. An alternative to your Preview function would be:  precodebman ()  {      : Display man page in default browser     man $* | col -b | bcat } /code/pre  ...or simply set codeman/code's pager:  precodeexport MANPAGER='col -b | bcat' man grep /code/pre  codebcat/code works with any command that writes to codestdout/code:  precodepbpaste  | bcat make test | bcat tail -n 1000 -f /var/log/messages | bcat /code/pre  ...etc.  It's a ruby-gem, so installation is as easy as:  precodegem install bcat /code/pre  If "on the fly" conversion isn't sufficient, and you want to produce HTML all at once, or in advance, this post on Unix.se has a number of suggestions (sadly one of my favourite tools, the mighty codepandoc/code, won't work for this...)  <comment333428> Unfortunately Bwana is apparently broken for macOS 10.12 and is not being maintained currently. [Another version of bwana](https://github.com/drdrang/bwana) offers better formatting but has the same problems. <comment333462> I'm using it on macOS 10.12 and it works fine. Bwana version 2.7
