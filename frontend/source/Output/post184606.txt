Trackpad not responding to clicks after macbook air wake from sleep <body> I have strange problem since two or three days with macbook air running osx 10.10.3 yosemite.  When I finish working I just close the lid and macbook goes into sleep mode. When I open the lid again it wakes up and everything works fine except the trackpad is not responding to clicks.  Keyboard works fine, trackpad gestures too. I can switch between apps, launch next applications and do everything except using trackpad for clicks. After reboot everything is fine again, until next sleep and wake.  I don't recall installing any new applications that could have caused this.  Is there any way to find out what's causing this issue and how to fix it?  <comment218926> could you show us the console log from the wake on till some 30 lines after that. <comment219084> I'll as soon as it happens again. No idea why but today it was fine. I did not change any settings or uninstall any apps
