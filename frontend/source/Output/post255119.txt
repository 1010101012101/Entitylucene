How can I recover files off this disk that won't mount? <body> I have an HFS+ disk that will not mount.  I've tried it in multiple enclosures, and the problem is the disk itself.  Disk Utility says it cannot repair, and so does DiskWarrior.  With codefsck/code I get this weird output.  precode$ sudo fsck_hfs /dev/disk4 ** /dev/rdisk4 (NO WRITE)    Executing fsck_hfs (version hfs-285). volumeType is 0 0000:  0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000       |................| . . . 01b0:  0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 00fe       |................| 01c0:  ffff eefe ffff 0100 0000 af6d 7074 0000       |...........mpt..| 01d0:  0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000       |................| . . . 01f0:  0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 55aa       |..............U.| /code/pre  Here is some output from syslog:  precode9/29/16 08:11:58.747 diskarbitrationd[67]: unable to repair /dev/disk4s2 (status code 0x00000008). 9/29/16 08:11:58.752 diskarbitrationd[67]: unable to mount /dev/disk4s2 (status code 0x00000001). /code/pre  <answer255123> Disk4 is the whole disk device and strongno/strong slice with an (HFS) file system. The output is the content of block0 omitting most lines containing only zeros. Block zero often is equivalent to the MBR/pMBR of a disk. Block0 doesn't contain a file system!  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zmirO.png" alt="enter image description here"  To verify/repair a file system, you have to choose a particular partition and the volume has to be mounted. The common external disk has two partitions: the EFI and the main volume - so try:  precodesudo fsck_hfs -f /dev/disk4s2 /code/pre  If the external disk has more than one visible volume, enter codediskutil list/code and choose the appropriate partition (e.g disk4s3 or disk4s4).  hr  If fsck_hfs fails to mount and/or repair the disk, try a data recovery tool like Data Rescue, R-Studio, Disk Drill etc.  If they also fail contact a professional data recovery specialist like Kroll Ontrack.
