I can't find the location of jdk for Java 7 and 8 <body> I have 3 different versions (jdk) of Java installed: 6, 7 and 8. In   codebash_profile/code:  precodeexport JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.8) setjdk() {   export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v $1) } /code/pre  However, at  precode$ ls /System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines 1.6.0.jdk /code/pre  I see only one version. Where are the 2 other ones? What's the location of their jdks?  <answer169836> In contrary to the Apple provided Java6 which will be installed to code/System/Library/Java/code and code/System/Library/Frameworks/code, Oracle's Java7 and Java8 are located at code/Library/Java//code in several subfolders.  <answer169869> You can see the install locations of the recognized JDKs by using codejava_home/code's "-V" option:  precode$ /usr/libexec/java_home -V Matching Java Virtual Machines (4):     1.8.0_31, x86_64:   "Java SE 8" /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_31.jdk/Contents/Home     1.7.0_55, x86_64:   "Java SE 7" /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_55.jdk/Contents/Home     1.6.0_65-b14-466.1, x86_64: "Java SE 6" /System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk/Contents/Home     1.6.0_65-b14-466.1, i386:   "Java SE 6" /System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk/Contents/Home /code/pre  You see newer JDKs are under code/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/code. I think it was moved out of "System" after Apple stopped developing the OSK JDK themselves and Oracle took over.  Also see code/usr/libexec/java_home --help/code for more options.
