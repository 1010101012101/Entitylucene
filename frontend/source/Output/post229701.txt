How do I fix this sudo permission issue - UID 503, should be 0 - El Capitan <body> Whenever I try any codesudo/code command whatsoever in terminal, I get the following error message:  precodesudo: /etc/sudoers is owned by uid 503, should be 0 sudo: no valid sudoers sources found, quitting /code/pre  I have tried logging into single user mode and typing in the following commands:  precodemount -uw  chown /private/etc/sudoers 0 /code/pre  After typing in the chown ownership line, I get an error message saying “illegal username”.  Other things I have tried:  ul liReinstalling the OS X (El Capitan) /li liDisabling System Integrity Protection (SIP)./li liCalling Apple Care who say that codesudo/code commands have been disabled in El Capitan./li liLogging in under Single User mode and typing in the following code:br codechown root:wheel /private/etc/sudoers/code This produced the error message “Operation Not Permitted” in my Standard, Admin, and Root accounts. The error message “Read-Only File System” came up when I logged in in Single User Mode./li /ul  FYI  When I run codels -la /private/etc/sudoers/code in Terminal, I get the following:  precode-rw-r-----@ 1 MY-ADMIN-USERNAME staff 67 18 Feb 14:03 /private/etc/sudoers /code/pre  Note I’ve replaced my actual admin username with “MY-ADMIN-USERNAME” just so you know what’s showing.  I need codesudo/code commands to work for a range of reasons, one of which is to get CrashPlan to work.  My hardware is a 2010 iMac, 3.2GHZ, 16GB Ram and 500GB SSD which was installed about a year ago.  These problems have only come up with El Capitan. I didn’t have them in the past with Yosemite.   Looking around online, I can see the many people have had similar issues but the resolutions unfortunately have not worked for me.  <answer229710> Try to repair your sudoers file from Recovery Mode:  ul liBoot to Recovery Mode by pressing kbdcmd/kbdkbdR/kbd while booting./li liOpen Terminal from the menubar - Utilities/li liEnter codecd "/Volumes/main_volume_name/private/etc"/code.

Next I clicked control + x to get out and then got the save prompt “Save modified buffer” and I clicked for Yes.
