Defaults tool equivalent of Ctrl-F7 <body> In OSX one can use Ctrl-F7 to change what the Tab key can move the focus between. By default it is only text boxes and lists but after pressing ctrl-f7 one can move between all ui elements.   I was wondering if there is a way to toggle this functionality by using the codedefaults/code tool.  <answer32186> After some searching the equivalent command using the codedefaults/code tool is   precodedefaults write NSGlobalDomain AppleKeyboardUIMode -int 2 /code/pre  Anyone can verify this by toggling the values and then reading the key value. The default value has a value of 0 and switching it to all ui elements will turn it to a value of 2.  <comment35713> Are you aware that you can change this setting in Preferences/Keyboard as well? <comment35714> Yes, but I would like to know if there is a way to modify this preference using the defaults tool.
