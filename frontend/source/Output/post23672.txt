The sorting of content is meant to be left up to the creator of the iTunes U collection/course.  The collections are automatically sorted alphabetically by collection name. If you click on the disclosure triangle for each collection, the lectures can then be sorted by release date in ascending or descending order.   <answer108589> Easiest way around this problem is to create a play list in the add + playlist.
