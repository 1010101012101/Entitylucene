How to change the font smoothing setting from the command line? <body> I'm trying to avoid installing lots of software willy-nilly, because like so many Mac users I don't have antivirus software. Case in point, I really like TinkerTool but I'd rather change my system wide settings from the command line than use someone's program for that.   So, how can I change the system-wide font smoothing setting from the command line?  Thanks.  <answer24301> It's codedefaults -currentHost write -globalDomain AppleFontSmoothing -int &lt;1-3&gt;/code as far as I remember
