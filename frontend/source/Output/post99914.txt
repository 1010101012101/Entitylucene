What is special in /Applications/ folder? <body> What happens when an .app bundle going copy to the code/Applications//code folder? Are there any strongprocesses/strong starting, any preferences copied to code/Library//code ? Is a copy to code/Applications//code folder a strongspecial trigger/event/strong for the OS X?  I found that if I just copy Xcode then codecom.apple.dt.Xcode.plist/code appears in user's codePreferences/code folder.  <answer99961> With the exception of installing app with package manager, there is no special events if you only copy application to any folders. The preferences stored in Library or Application Support are created when you run the application for the first time.
