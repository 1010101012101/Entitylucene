Opening .msg file in Outlook for Mac 2011 <body> Most of my colleagues use Outlook on Windows and I need to access emails stored in .msg format (don't ask, it's complicated).  My understanding is that .msg is an Outlook file format, but Outlook 2011 on Mac can't open them.  When I right-click on the file and ask to open with Outlook, it creates an email with the .msg file as an attachment.  Using various dragging and trying to open with the file menu also don't help.  Any ideas on how to open these on Mac?  Preferably without having to install additional software.  <answer36519> I'm sorry to say, currently .msg files can't be opened using Outlook 2011. I have found the only way is one of three things:  ol liGet them in a .pst file ( which might not work for you, cause you are getting them as a .msg file for a reason)./li liInstall Windows and Outlook on your Mac through Boot Camp (although it seems like to much just to view emails)./li liTry Klammer it will let you open them, and on their site is says open in Outlook./li /ol  I think your best bet might be number 3.  resources:  Can saved Outlook email and contacts (in .msg format) be converted and then imported?
