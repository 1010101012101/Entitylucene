Java and Flash Player do not work on Chromium <body> I've just installed the latest version of Chromium. But, neither Java nor Flash Player work.  How can this be fixed? As far as I can see, Chromium no longer supports PPAPI and NPPAPI.  <answer200408> Unfortunately Google seems to think they know better than everyone else what people need to use online...  Here's the deal. They've deprecated those APIs, meaning if you want Java/Flash to work, you're out of luck.  emHOWEVER/em, they haven't been removed yet, merely disabled. It'll get removed in a couple of major versions, but you can still force-enable them in the short term. This strongWILL/strong stop working when Chrome 45 comes out in a few months. The only alternative then if you need Java/Flash will be to switch to a different browser.  In short:  For PPAPI plugins, go to codechrome://plugins/code, scroll to the plugin, hit Details, and Under "Type: PPAPI," click Enable.  For NPAPI plugins, go to codechrome://flags/#enable-npapi/code. There's an option there that says codeEnable NPAPI/code. Toggle that, and restart the browser.  I'd suggest getting used to Firefox or Safari in the meantime :(  <comment241483> yeah i know the option but it is not available for chromium. They have fully removed npapi and ppapi
