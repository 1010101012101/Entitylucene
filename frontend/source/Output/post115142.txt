Modifier keys settings does not work on login screen <body> I am using a PC keyboard and have to switch the kbdWin/kbd (kbdâŒ˜ Cmd/kbd key) and the kbdAlt/kbd (kbdOpt/kbd key) for this to feel like a proper Apple keyboard. I have this remapped via System Preferences for my user account just fine.  However, this remapping does not work on the login screen, everything seems to be reverted to as if I haven't done any remapping on the login screen.  As I want to use the kbdCmd/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+codeLetter/code to select my face to login without having to touch the mouse it became annoying every time I had to re-remember that the remap only takes effect after I login.  Any suggestion on how can I change the modifier key settings for when I am not yet logged-in?  <answer115161> Run:  precodesudo cp ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/.GlobalPreferences.*.plist \     /var/root/Library/Preferences/ByHost /code/pre  and restart.  <comment134903> @Jawa thanks for the edit! : ) <comment134904> Works great, thanks! <comment166222> Should this work also for updating modifier keys?
