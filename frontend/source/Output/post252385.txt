Terminal isn't storing latest used commands in mac <body> I have been facing big issue in my mac, For past few hours my terminal not showing any history of recently used commands in the terminal.  Whenever I close and re-open the terminal its getting cleared all the data. I am not sure what is going on?  <comment314009> As you seem to have several related problems: what did you change a few hours ago? Installed software, reorganized files, anything? <comment314011> I just cleard history of commands @patrix <comment314013> How did you do that? <comment314014> I agree with @patrix Whatever happened a few hrs ago has resulted in this unintended consequence. How'd you clear the history? <comment314017> @patrix  history -c <comment314019> Does http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/221636/i-deleted-bash-history-now-history-isnt-saved-anymore-although-i-re-created/223048#223048 help?
