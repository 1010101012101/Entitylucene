What font is used for keyboard symbols? <body> I'm looking for the font that Apple is using for Special Key Symbols on their keyboards. I know that Vag Rounded is used for regular characters, but that font does not support characters used for the special keys. I've been searching for a font that would look at least similar to the symbols, but so far I haven't found anything satisfying. For example, here are some of the keys with the special symbols:  Return(↩) key: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iFtzt.jpg" alt="return key"  Tab(⇥), Caps Lock(⇪), Shift(⇧), Alt(⌥), Command(⌘) keys: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jeWbs.jpg" alt="various keys"  <answer161657> You could find that symbols in emoji keyboard. Just type kbdctrl/kbd+kbd⌘/kbd+kbdspace/kbd and search for it.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JH1WQ.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment188891> Thanks, unfortunately none of the installed fonts look like the symbols on the keyboard. For example, the return key symbol is always curved, whereas on the keyboard it has sharp corners.
