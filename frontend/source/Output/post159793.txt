What is happening when time machine refuses to travel for Chrome local storage? <body> I wanted to retrieve a backup of /Users/MYNAME/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Local Storage.  however, TM seems to be claiming that the entire folder came into existence about 30 minutes ago, which is not likely; I've been using Chrome for years.  I subsequently was able to use the tmutil command line:  precodetmutil restore /Volumes/Backup\ 6//Backups.backupdb/tinfoilhat/2014-12-07-070215/Macintosh\ HD//Users/MYNAME/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Local\ Storage/ ~/restored /code/pre  which shows that the backups were out there. So why wouldn't the TM UI show them?  <comment187819> how is this a Apple Question? <comment187822> How is a misbehavior of time machine _not_ an apple question? <comment187902> Probably a dumb question; but you can see other folders in your Library folder on the older backups using the GUI, right? <comment187956> Yes. Only that Chrome neighborhood depopulates.
