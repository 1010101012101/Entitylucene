Why does Image Magick fail to read fonts? <body> I'm trying to create a simple contact sheet of all the photos in a directory using codeMontage/code:  precode$ montage -font Helvetica -pointsize 10 *.png contact_sheet.jpg /code/pre  However, I keep getting a error reading the font file:  precodemontage: unable to read font `Helvetica' @ error/annotate.c/RenderFreetype/1239. /code/pre  I've tried several fonts, including Arial, and putting the font name in quotes, but get the same error.  Leaving the code-font/code option blank returns:  precodeunable to read font '(null)' @ error/annotate.c/RenderFreetype/1239 /code/pre  <answer261189> I've found that installing GhostScript fixes the problem. Using brew: codebrew install gs/code  <comment272055> Try `identify -list font` to see which fonts are available. <comment273184> @MarkSetchell It doesn't return anything. <comment273188> Have a look here.... http://stackoverflow.com/a/24701602/2836621
