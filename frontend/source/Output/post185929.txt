Extending Finder view "All My Files" to external drives <body> Is there a way to include files on external drives in the Finder's "All My Files" view? I found this older answer, but it's not working in OS X 10.10.  <comment219361> The linked solution works for me (running 10.10.3). Are the external drives excluded from Spotlight indexing?  Take a look at  `System Preferences  Spotlight  Privacy` <comment219365> How much of the process isn't working? (i.e. Where have you gotten to?)
