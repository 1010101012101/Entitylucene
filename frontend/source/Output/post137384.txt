List wireless connection information in terminal <body> In OSX if you hold down the Option key and click on the wireless icon in the menu bar it will show details of the wifi connection - speed, BSSID ,channel etc.  Can this information be listed in the terminal?  <answer137385> Yes, with the following command:  precode/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport -I /code/pre  <comment163275> Thanks!
