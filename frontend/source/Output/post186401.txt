Images from PDF to presentation: low quality <body> I have a PDF that has some embedded images, and for some reason I'm not able to extract them with wondershare PDF editor (they're not even seen as images). So I tried to make a screenshot with cmd+alt+4 but the captured images have a too low quality, specially when I insert them into a powerpoint presentation. This is how they are seen in the PDF:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9OX7K.png" alt="enter image description here"  And this is how they appear in the presentation: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rDXWQ.png" alt="enter image description here"  I don't know if you can see the difference, but it's clearer when I run the presentation on my macbook. The problem is that I don't find a way to directly extract the images, so I'm looking for an alternative solution, something like a high-quality screenshot or another way to extract images from the PDF.  <answer186429> Preview app on 10.6.8 doesn't let you extract images except by selecting then copying and creating a new file from clipboard.  Another way is using the free unix xpdf tools. They come with a utility called codepdfimages/code. I just used it on a PDF and it perfectly extracted the images from the file.  For example...  codepdfimages -f 2 -l 2 -j 27487.pdf testname/code  It extracted the images starting (-f) and ending (-l) on page 2 and saved as JPG.  xpdf is available from HomeBrew.  HTH   <answer205989> Extract images and graphics directly with a free app: The Unarchiver (App Store) ; The Unarchiver is mostly used/known for compressing and uncompressing files.  Just right-click and codeOpen With/code  codeThe Unarchiver.app/code  Or simply drag the file directly to The Unarchiver  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tl91A.gif" alt="enter image description here"  Works fine with pdf, doc, docx, xls, xlsx, ppt, pot, pps, pptx, and others.   <comment220037> What method did you use ? <comment220043> To extract the images I used wondershare PDF editor, and there was only was inside it. I discovered that all the other elements are excel objects but an image is still missing. <comment220045> Sorry, why would you need the wondershare? Can you give me the link to the pdf online so I can test. <comment220047> I download the pdf and then open it in Preview, from there I can extract elements. I assume you have the try-it version of wondershare? <comment220211> Yes I'm using the free version, this is the link: http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/wsdm13-threads.pdf
