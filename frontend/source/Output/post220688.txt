Reboot an Application when it Takes too Much Memory <body> Some applications start off with small memory footprints, but slowly grow to take up way too much RAM. Is there a way I can automatically detect when an app reaches a certain threshold, and then kill and relaunch the app?  I know that I can see the memory footprint on Activity Monitor, but that doesn't seem to be AppleScript-able. I can also see an application's memory footprint by using codeps aux/code, but its numbers don't seem to match up with Activity Monitor's.  I'd appreciate any help with this  <comment267132> Do you have specific application in mind? Restarting Safari or Contacts might be quite different from restarting an editing application with unsaved documents. <comment267133> @patrix: good question. I used `fluidapp` (a site-specific browser application) to create several applications for facebook, reddit, stackoverflow, etc. This post is motivated by Facebook being a memory hog. However, I would ideally like this to be application-agnostic, with potentially an alert message, leaving the end-user to give a final go/no-go for application reboot. Does that make sense?
