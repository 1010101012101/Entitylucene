How to make command apm available after installing atom? <body> I have installed github's editor atom into code/Application/code. I now expected to have the command codeapm/code at my disposal to be able to install further packages. Yet:  precode$ apm -bash: apm: command not found /code/pre  How do I get the codeapm/code command?  <answer131349> By opening atom and going via codeAtom &gt; Install Shell Commands/code you will get codeatom/code and codeapm/code commands.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HTNk0.png" alt="Screenshot of menu to add commands"  <answer197708> Atom-Install Shell Commands would install atom and apm commands.  <answer259286> After the Shell Commands installation:  ol liMacOSX: Open Terminal and run the "sudo apm install package-name"/li liWindows: Open CMD as administrator and run the "apm install package-name"/li /ol  <comment260872> I've done this and still the command cannot be found in the terminal. Any ideas where it resides so I can modify my bash file? <comment262302> @kakubei `$ which apm` gives me `/usr/bin/apm`, so there it should be. <comment262437> Thanks, I was getting nothing for `which` or `whereis`, etc. <comment314046> doesn't work for me <comment339872> "sudo apm install package-name" worked for me. Nothing else would. <comment339874> Try: "sudo apm help" Nothing else worked for me
