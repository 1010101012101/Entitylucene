Movies button missing in Purchased items in iTunes <body> I've bought some movies in iTunes on my Mac. Now I want to download them to my Windows XP PC in iTunes. (Both machines have the latest iTunes version installed.)  According to the description at the apple web site, I should see the movies in the "Purchased" section of the quick links. I can get to the "Purchased" section fine, except that I don't get a "Movies" button at all.  Any ideas about how to get the movies button (or get the movies to the other pc in an other way)?  <answer66475> That's because most movies are not yet available to redownload like music and apps are.  <answer72073> You're probably in an iTunes-restricted country. While any user may re-download apps and books, re-downloads of music and movies are restricted to certain countries.  You'll need to manually copy the movies over to the XP computer. Note that you will need to activate iTunes with your AppleID to be able to play them.  <comment78189> Three unrelated questions: Could you show us a screenshot of what you do see? Is the movie already downloaded to your Mac? Are you viewing Purchased on your Mac or PC? <comment78263> I'm not sure what you're talking aboutâ€”once you purchase anything through iTunes you can download it at any time free of charge (which the exception of rentals). <comment78447> What can't you re-download? <comment78458> Some TV shows and movies, as far as I'm aware. <comment78719> I have not heard of that; unless you can find an example of this I am fairly sure you are in some way misinformed. <comment78730> http://hothardware.com/m/News/Apple-iTunes-Movie-ReDownloads-Not-Coming-Anytime-Soon/Default.aspx a quick google finds this, of course this is from a year ago, so maybe things have changed <comment78731> It seems to say at press time *no* movies were available for re-download, and as all that I know of *are*, I expect it's completely outdated. <comment78733> Ahhh it depends where you live! http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5085 <comment78757> Oh, that's the confusion! Good sleuthing.
