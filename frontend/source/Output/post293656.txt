iTunes wifi sync stubbornly refuses to work <body> With a USB cable, both my iPhone (running 10.3.3) and iPad (running the iOS 11 beta) can sync just fine with my mac (running 10.12.6). But disconnect the cable, and wifi sync doesn't work.  I have tried each of the following repeatedly in various orders:  ul liRebooting the mac/li liRebooting the device/li liReinstalling iTunes/li likilling usbmuxd and letting it restart/li likilling iTunes Helper and restarting it/li liUnchecking and rechecking the wifi sync checkbox/li liUnchecking and rechecking the sync automatically checkbox/li lideleting and recreating /var/db/lockdown/li lireset all settings (on the phone)/li lilogging out and into iCloud on mac and devices/li liswitching between WiFi and Ethernet on the mac/li liBooting into a recovery OS (at the Apple store)/li liscouring the logs in Console and /var/log/li lireplacing the login keychain/li /ul  None of that has made a difference.  This was working up until sometime last month. And, no, I don't know what changed to make it not work.  I've taken everything to the Apple store. The geniuses spent an hour trying various things and they drew a blank.  The symptoms have varied, but at the moment, it's that the device(s) don't show up in iTunes. On the device, I get the blue "Sync now" but tapping that just hangs until it gives up.  I have black belt in *nix administration and programming. I can supply any reasonably helpful configuration or logging information to get this working again.  W. T. F.
