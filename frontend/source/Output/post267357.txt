Photos app reverts to old library <body> If I click on "Open package to see Photos Library" on my MacBook Pro, Photos starts up and what appears is a version of my Library from 2014.  After that, starting Photos brings up that same old version, making it seem as though the newer pictures have disappeared. I can recover the full library by right clicking on the "Open package..." file and then selecting the current photoslibrary file.   However, iTunes persists in seeing the old version and won't copy newer photos onto my other devices.    Does anyone know a fix for this?   <comment335445> Can you please provide more information to help us help you? Which MacOS/OS X version are you running? Which Photos version are you using? Which iTunes version is causing the problem? <comment335459> What's an "Open package..." file? Are you launching Photos from the Library file itself, rather than setting the correct one from inside Photos? Try launching Photos itself, hold Opt as it's starting up, choose your default Library location from the dialog. <comment335499> Resetting the Library as described by Tetsujin made no difference. The behavior stays the same.  The small problem is that opening the Photos file by clicking on the package file in the Library entitled "Open package to see Photos Library" brings up a 2014 version of the Photos Library. The big problem is that this seems to have messed up iTunes. <comment335500> Thanks NoahL: mid 2015 Retina MacBook Pro; OSX 10.11.6; iTunes 12.5.4.42; Photos Version 1.5 (370.42.0) <comment335891> It turned out that I also needed to enable the correct library as the System Photo Library, by selecting it in the Photos Preferences pane while having it open. This issue is now solved.
