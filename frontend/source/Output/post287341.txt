El Capitan "Paste and Match Style" not working in Microsoft Word <body> I want to set up my computer to paste unformatted text by default. When I try to do this (following the advise of several online guides) my paste no longer works. I went to keyboard  shortcuts  app shortcuts  +. See my changes below. When I try command+v in Microsoft Word, nothing happens. What went wrong here? Is there a way I can make this work in Microsoft Word? img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rJbDc.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer287345>    When I try ctrl+v   kbdCommand/kbd+kbdV/kbd  Try to delete and add one again.  It works for me (macOS Sierra, Safari):br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tMSjV.png" width="280"   <answer287346> http://www.suppertime.co.uk/blogmywiki/2015/07/unformatted-paste/  First make a new macro in Word. Go to Tools  Macro  Macros… and make a new macro called PasteUnformatted.  Paste this code into the Visual Basic editor:  Sub PasteUnformatted() Selection.PasteSpecial DataType:=wdPasteText End Sub  Then remap the cmd+V shortcut by going to Tools  Customize Keyboard… then pick ‘Macros’ from the Categories list. Find PasteUnformatted and assign cmd-V to it, click on the ‘assign’ button, and now every time you press cmd-V it should paste unformatted text that matches the formatting of the new document you are working on.  <answer287374> The trick for any non-standard app is to set the key command for that app alone.br You also need to remove or alter any existing conflict [in this case kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd V /kbd] so the simplest in this case seems to be to just swap them over.  The following seems to work just fine on Word 2011, can't test on any other versions  [BTW, Word doesn't appear in the list when you try to add it as an app - you have to use Other... &amp; go find it in Applications]  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4C6hG.png" alt="enter image description here"  emEdit/embr ... or perhaps not.br Paste and Match Formatting isn't the same as 'unformatted text'  I came up with this compromise  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ICNNI.png" alt="enter image description here"  It's not a one-key fix, unfortunately -  though you can just hit [Down Arrow depending on the existing format the menu presents different options], Enter  <comment362791> Did the checkmark appear for you? It still isn't working for me. <comment362792> I'm mostly testing this with Microsoft word... <comment362793> No, there is no checkmark <comment362794> I see now. It works in most places but not in Microsoft Word. <comment362821> Word doesn't use the command "Paste and Match Style" it uses "Paste and Match Formatting" <comment362822> Pro tip for screenshots of a window - after you hit cmd/shift/4 tap the spacebar & then the window you click in will be screen-snapped perfectly, including nice drop-shadow.
