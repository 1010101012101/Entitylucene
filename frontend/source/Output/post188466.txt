APPLE SSD SM0512F Media Equivalent <body> My codeMac Pro/code (Late 2013) uses an codeAPPLE SSD SM0512F Media SSD/code; I'd like to buy an equivalent codeSSD/code to use externally for cloning, backups, etc.   I noticed on the PassMark website it shows performance information in comparison with some other codeSSDs/code, however, it doesn't show what codeSSDs/code are ranked directly above or below it, so I have no idea what it's closest competitors might be.  It doesn't appear Apple sells the codeSM0512F/code — what (if any) would be equivalent?  <comment223039> Be aware that Yosemite does not like the non Apple SSD's. <comment223134> It might not like it, but they work without problems. Only TRIM is not working. I bought a Transcend JetDrive 725 SSD and it works really nice. <comment223215> @Buscar웃SD: Could you please elaborate on that? <comment223216> @Rainer: Thanks for the recommendation; do all non-Apple SSDs have that issue with TRIM not working, and what (if any) resolution is there to it? <comment223218> @Rainer correct, so how are you doing without the trim? The SSD wont last very long! <comment223303> @Buscar웃SD Yes, I am doing it without TRIM. And there are quite a few who are doing it without TRIM. Could you please elaborate on your statement? <comment223305> @I'L'I Yes. Apple is using kext signing and so no TRIM can be enabled for non-apple SSD, except of when using Trim Enabler at https://www.cindori.org/software/trimenabler/ See some other comments in this thread http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/176821/jetdrive-725-should-i-use-trim-enabler where I asked a similar question.
