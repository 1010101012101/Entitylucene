Change which microphone iOS 7 applications use? <body> Here's the problem. I have an iPhone 5c and when I use the front facing camera to record video (whether using default camera app, Instagram, SnapChat) or when I use anything that uses the front microphone such as Siri or the speakerphone, the microphone does not pick up any sound.   The other two microphones work properly and what I am looking for is a tweak or function that disables the front microphone and uses the bottom or rear microphone to pickup sound.   If it comes down to it, I'll eventually buy a new replacement part but I would prefer to have a software tweak to keep my warranty intact and such.   If you could point me in the right direction of where I could go to request this or to even create this tweak myself, that would be greatly appreciated.   -  This is a relatively common issue it seems based on google searches. I know about the privacy settings, I've done the restores, I've done all of that and still no luck.   I am jailbroken on 7.0.4 iOS and I know quite a bit about the software and hardware.   Is there a .plist file for each application that uses the front microphone that I can change? Or a tweak I could create or use to disable the microphone and perhaps clone or mimic the other microphones but change the name it is used to lookup to enable what mic?  I don't know. Anything will help because right now all I have is the basic idea or concept.   <comment138772> Sounds like a hardware fault - just replace?
