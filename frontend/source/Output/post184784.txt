Is it safe to delete my Time Machine sparse bundle? Can a fresh one be recreated? <body> Is it safe to delete my Time Machine sparse bundle file? Can a fresh time machine backup be recreated strongWITHOUT reformatting the drive or affecting any other files/strong on my external Time Machine drive?  My time machine backups stopped a month ago and nothing I do will get the backups to continue as usual.  The drive is 25% full.  I don't know what to do.  The way I look at it, the best option might be to delete the sparse bundle entirely and just start a fresh sparse bundle, right?   This seems logical to me but I cannot find any advice anywhere to affirm my belief.  I am afraid to choose the "Delete backup disk" option in the Time Machine applet because, while I want it to delete my sparse bundle, I am afraid it will take the liberties of deleting all content on the "drive".   That would be disastrous since I also use the drive for a important file share.   I'm also afraid to delete the sparse bundle because I don't know exactly how it works.  Can anyone provide advice?  I cannot find any advice on this specific subject anwhere.  <answer186021> As long as you don't care about anything in the backup being gone, yes it is safe to remove the sparsebundle.  Disable Time Machine first. Instead of deleting the whole bundle at once:  ul liRight-click and choose Show Package Contents./li liOpen the embands/em folder./li liSelect a large number of bands (8000 at a time seems to be good from what I read) and move those to the trash./li liRepeat until all bands have been deleted, then delete the main sparsebundle file./li /ul  <answer186147> I followed the links suggested by njboot and the solution to my problem was:  ol liTurn off time machine backups. /li liDelete time machine system prefs file/li liReboot machine and if the file is still there, delete the prefs file again and reboot again. /li lionce the Prefs file is gone, if you go into Time machine prefs, the disk is no longer selected. /li liThen, finally select the disk that you had been connected to before and then the backup should connect successfully again. /li liAt that point it was working for me again./li /ol  <answer234422> Sparsebundles are created for each machine backed up to Time Machine. I needed to delete one of these sparsebundle files. Manually deleting thousands of files under the 'Bands' folder takes a long time. The faster and easiest method is:  ol liOpen Terminal/li liSwitch to 'Superuser': strongsudo su/strong (you will be asked for your admin user pw)/li liChange directory to your Time Machine/Sparsebundle path: strongcd /filepath to Time Machine/strong/li liList files to be sure you see the emSparsebundle/em you wish to remove: strongls/strong/li liRemove the sparsebundle: strongrm -r "sparsebundle_filename.sparsebundle"/strong/li liExit Superuser: strongexit/strong/li liClose Terminal/li /ol  Note that while logged in as Superuser you can do anything to your Mac so strongbe certain you know what you're doing while logged in as 'su'/strong. Also, I put my filename in quotes as it contained spaces, you do not need to enclose in quotes if your filename does not contain any spaces.  It takes a minute or two to remove the offending file, depending on file size. You're done!  <comment219147> Follow Pondini’s troubleshooting for problem’s regarding network backups: [Other Backup Fails](http://pondini.org/TM/C2.html) and more generally [FAQ On Troubleshooting Backups](http://pondini.org/TM/Troubleshooting.html) <comment219709> Thanks for the suggestion.  What IS the "bands" folder?   Just afraid to try these steps without knowing what that is. <comment219732> It contains the data that was backed up.
