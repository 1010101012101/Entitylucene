Is it possible to turn off iCloud Photo Library on one device only? <body> I would like to know if its possible to turn off iCloud Photo Library on one of my devices. The device in question is a MacBook Air which I use while at the office during the day. I would like to keep photos on for my iPhone, iMac, and MacBook Pro. Anyone know if this is possible on a device level?  I might add the reason that I would like to know if this is possible. I’m noticing the photo processes are using high CPU as well as kernel_task. I’m attempting to minimize CPU.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vEqeC.png" alt="Activity Monitor"  <answer282182> On your MacBook Air, open strong/strong → strongSystem Preferences/strong → strongiCloud/strong and emuncheck/em strongPhotos/strong.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9xynO.jpg" alt="iCloud Preferences"  This will prevent iCloud Photos from syncing to and from the device on which you did this.  On iOS, this is done by going into strongSettings/strong → strongPhotos/strong and emdisabling/em strongiCloud Photo Library/strong.  <comment355282> Yes, I use iCloud photo library. If I turn of this feature from my MacBook Air, I will have disabled iCloud photo library on an account level and on all of my devices, hence compromising my iCloud library. Right? <comment355284> No, it will *not* disable it at the account level, only on the computer that you disable syncing from. Disabling at the account level is done by going into **Manage…** → **Photo Library** → **Disable and Delete**.
