AddressBookSourceSync a virus? <body> On my mac, in activity process, there are two processes that keep on running even though I stop them. They are AddressBookSourceSync and com.apple.AddressBook.ContactsAccountsService. Is it possible that they are viruses or am I just being paranoid. How do I quit these? I tried everything but it keeps turning back on.  <answer294131> Taken from on of the answers in https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3355782?start=45&amp;tstart=0:  ul liExport all contacts to a vCard file for safe keeping./li liDelete Library -- Application Support -- Address Book./li liReboot./li liOpen System Preferences -- iCloud.

AddressBookSourceSync is a built-in Apple program relating to the address book (contacts) application <comment297541> @NoahL Yes I force quitted, restarted but it is still there. Can you tell me what it is supposed to do? Maybe I can tell you if it is supposed to be running. I can't find much info on the internet. And the thing is I have never used the contacts application on my mac. <comment297544> Let me know if this doesn't help you out: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3355782?start=45&tstart=0
