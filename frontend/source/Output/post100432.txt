Garage band app-file recovery? <body> I dropped my iphone4s in water and when I got a new phone and brought back the GarageBand app none of my songs were there. Is there ANYWAY I can recover these files?   <answer100434> iOS stores backups in two places:  ul liiCloud - sign in to your account and see if a backup of the device is stored there/li liiTunes - check iTunes on each computer you may have connected it to recently, when you sync to a computer, it will make backups of your songs and other data/li /ul  http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4946
