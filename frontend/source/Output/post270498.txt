How to revoke "Always allow" privileges from an application? <body> The application I have in mind is the codesecurity/code command line tool bundled with Macos. The codeman/code page describes it as:  precodesecurity -- Command line interface to keychains and Security framework /code/pre  hr  At some point recently I wanted to get a password from my keychain using the command-line. Which is done using the following command:  precodematt@laptop ~ $ security find-generic-password -a 'foobar' /code/pre  The first time I ran it I saw the usual emAlways Allow/em, emDeny/em, and emAllow/em dialogue. I (foolishly) picked emAlways Allow/em and now I can't find how/where to undo that.  I've looked using Keychain Access to see if the codesecurity/code tool appears there but it doesn't. The closest thing I could find was an entry for codeCommCenter/code but it was last modified before I ever used the codesecurity/code command.  <answer270505> Launch the Keychain Access Utility and find the entry you used that password with then right click it to bring up its info window. Click the Access Control Tab and there you will see a list of applications that have "Always allow access" enabled. Highlight the application in the list that you want remove and click the [-] button to remove it from Always allowed access.   <comment339969> I'm having trouble figuring out which entry has been added as a result of this particular _Always Allow_. Do you have any idea how I might track it down in this case? <comment340130> Well, its a password so make sure you're only looking at the Passwords as selected in the Navigation bar. I see modification dates when I view the list of password this way- do any of the modification dates you see match the day you made your terminal change?
