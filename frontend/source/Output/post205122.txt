Removing Mathias' dotfiles settings <body> Just installed Mathias' dotfiles but I didn't like some features of it. Especially executing code./.osx/code command. For example it's changing dock icons' sizes, removing TimeMachine icons (i'm using it frequently), changing locale settings etc.  How can I revert strongall/strong settings to default ones, remove all dotfiles settings.   After this I'll for the dotfiles project and make my own dotfiles based on Mathias' project.  <answer205126> There is no simple command to revert everything to default.  Depending on the number of installed apps besides Apple's own standard apps, it's probably faster to reinstall OS X or restore a backup.  .osx alone modifies about 200 settings - assuming one mod per 4 lines.  Next time better use a hypervisor like VMware or Virtual Box, set up your preferred OS X in a VM and test dotfiles using the snapshot feature.  <comment247335> Simply remove all `.*` files  from `$HOME` dir except: `.CFUserTextEncoding` and `.DS_Store`. <comment247337> But **.osx** file changed some settings with `defaults write ...` command . Deleting files won't affect settings ? <comment247338> Ah You are right I didn't think of it. <comment247339> Well, I'll try to revert them in *hardcore way* . I'll modify .osx file and replace all *true* strings with *false* settings. And check all settings one by one. <comment247340> @Eray Iâ€™d `defaults delete` instead and let the system restore the default settings. https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/issues/190 <comment247341> I'll upgrade my system from Yosemite to El Capitan , Will this upgrade fix my problems too? @MathiasBynens <comment247345> @Eray - no as it will not chnage any files in your home directory so all the  script chnages will stay <comment247346> But won't it change all default settings (which affected by **.osx** file) to El Capitan defaults ? <comment247510> @Eray Only if you perform a clean install.
