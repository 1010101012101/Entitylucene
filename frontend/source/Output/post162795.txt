Easily check time in Yosemite full screen mode <body> I'm trying to embrace Yosemite's full screen by default. Mostly I'm getting used to and liking it... except for the fact that without a menu bar I can't check the time at a glance.  What are some easy ways to display the current time on Yosemite without using the mouse/trackpad?  <answer162796> You can move focus to menu bar with for example: kbd⌃ CTRL/kbd+kbdF2/kbd or kbd⌘ CMD/kbd+kbd⇧ SHIFT/kbd+kbd//kbd.  Alternatively You can show strongDashboard/strong with clock as a widget (but set the strongDashboard/strong not as a separate space).
