Ctrl + Alt + Delete: Mac Equivalent? <body> strongCtrl + Alt + Delete/strong on Windows provides a variety of functions, the main one of interest being the Task Manager. Is there an equivalent keyboard shortcut &amp; indeed Task Manager for carrying out such tasks as quitting an application that maybe "hanging" (amongst other things) for Apple Macs, or indeed anything similar ?  <answer86015> The keyboard shortcut you’re looking for is kbd⌘/kbd + kbd⌥/kbd + kbd⎋/kbd, alternatively known as kbdcommand/kbd + kbdoption/kbd + kbdescape/kbd. This will bring up the emForce Quit Applications/em window (see screenshot below).  img src="https://i.imgur.com/Ctchc5W.png" alt="Force Quit Window"  <answer86033> There is no all in one equivalent:  ul liThe equivalent of the Windows Task Manager is The Activity Monitor app./li liThe equivalent of Close Session or Shut Down are found in the Apple Menu./li liThe equivalent of Change Password is the Users pane of the Configuration app./li liThe equivalent of Lock Computer is "Login Window..." under the User (your user name) menu./li /ul  <answer86035> You can use codeActivity Monitor/code and create a global keyboard shortcut to it via BetterTouchTool.  <answer86061> I normally open terminal. Then use top and kill the process.   <answer119226> see http://support.apple.com/kb/TA22781?viewlocale=en_US That is the answer to Ctrl + Alt + Delete on a PC.  <answer119229> kbdAlt/kbd/kbdOption/kbd-kbdCommand/kbd-kbdEsc/kbd to force applications to quit.  For Task Manager style stuff Activity Monitor is it by default and its not key invoked.  You could attach a key combo in preferences to Activity Monitorbr Preferences - Keyboard - Shortcuts - App Shortcuts --   strongApplication/strong: Finderbr strongMenu Title/strong: whateverbr strongKeyboard Shortcut/strong: You key combo.     <answer119262> To complete previous answers :  ul liThe shortcut control-eject brings up the shutdown/reboot confirmation dialog (I use this a lot : you just have to type control-eject then enter to shutdown. Very handy!)/li liPressing cmd-shift-Q brings up the quit session confirmation dialog./li /ul  <answer139631> Ctrl + Shift + ESC gives you the task manager. This solved my problem.

The force-quit shortcut is much easier to use if you just want to quickly kill a misbehaving application. <comment99203> The equivalent of Lock Computer is...? <comment99204> @Simon - I don't know: I don't need it. But if somebody has the answer, feel free to edit my answer or add it as comment. <comment99205> OK Excellent... <comment99208> For "Lock Computer" see http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/64/is-there-a-quick-way-to-lock-my-mac <comment99210> @patrix Cheers ! <comment99266> @Simon Added Lock Computer equivalent. You can also set the screen saver to require a password and just activate the screen saver when you leave your desk (I use a hot corner to do this). <comment99280> @chaiguy V.Good <comment121629> @Simon Of interest: Bill Gates admits Control-Alt-Delete was a mistake, blames IBM http://www.theverge.com/2013/9/26/4772680/bill-gates-admits-ctrl-alt-del-was-a-mistake <comment139064> Answers on Ask Different need to be more than just a link. It's okay to include a link, but please summarize or excerpt it in the answer. The idea is to make the answer stand alone. <comment161962> Two problems with this answer: 1 you're starting a new process which will suck on a bogged down machine. 2 anybody unfamiliar with terminal will need a little more info. <comment164607> How does this add to or improve on http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/86015/237 or other answers here? <comment190206> If you just need to lock your computer quickly, you can press either Control+Shift+Eject or in keyboards without an Eject key you can use Control+Shift+Power <comment222864> I had no idea that ⎋ was Escape -- thanks for clearing this up for me!
