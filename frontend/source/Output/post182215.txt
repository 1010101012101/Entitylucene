App Store Update stuck <body> I've downloaded the "Pro Video Formats 2.0.1" update at least twice, but it keeps showing up in the Mac App Store. How do I fix this?img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hNpRe.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer182245> I had something like with with another update a few weeks ago. It is probably caused by their database records being slightly out-of-sync.  I ignored it for a couple days, and it went away.  <answer182517> I had that issue with the 2.0.1 update as well. What finally worked for me (see this Apple Support Discussion) was downloading Pacifist and using it to install the update that I downloaded manually from the Apple Support site here. All you have to do is choose "Open Package" in Pacifist, select the Pro Video update disk image, and install the top-level item ("Contents of [dmg name].dmg").  This method seems to have worked for me. However, something about the installer seems to mess with file permissions, because Disk Utility had a lot to sort out after installing. This seems to have more to do with the Apple Installer itself, though, and not the method by which it is installed.  <answer182790> From Apple Support Communities     Just called Apple support... here is the official fix.      ol   liMove all files from /Library/QuickTime/ to a temp older on desktop/li   liOpen AppStore and download/install update/li   liReboot/li   liCopy any missing files from temp folder on desktop to /Library/QuickTime. For me this was 1 file, AppleMPEG2Codec.component./li   /ol   <comment217922> I also just snickered each time my Mac Pro tried to install that package. It went 5 rounds and seems to have sorted itself out. As far as I can tell, it's not a burning issue unless you really need one of the packages to work. I don't so I just ignored it. If you did need the update, then taking action might be a better choice than just laughing it off. <comment217969> Same one old codec was the same for me as well. I skipped the temp folder and just deleted everything. I used Time Machine to restore the one missing folder after the update/reboot.
