Can't download apps from App Store (Can't connect to iTunes) <body> I cannot download any apps from the App Store (free apps) any more.   The massage I receive is "Cannot connect to the iTunes Store."  It seems that after I connect to iTunes with my laptop, it all happened.br I tried to install free apps from the App Store, but when I press the 'free' the circle started moving but it stopped and the 'free' appeared again.  Additionally when I try to add something to the wish list, I was asked to sign in with my Apple ID. I signed in but the error came up "can not connect to iTunes."  I tried another way: Settings → iTunes &amp; App Store → Apple ID showed my account, but again the message I received was "Cannot connect to the iTunes Store."
