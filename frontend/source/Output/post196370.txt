OS X 10.11 El Capitan - Verifying file dialog, every time a file is opened <body> Not sure, if this question will be closed, but the situation is quite annoying.  Every time, I open some .pdf or .jpg file, a dialog appears,and it seems to be stuck there for a long time. After I click on close button, and open the file again, it opens without the dialog.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DQoen.jpg" alt="Verifying file dialog OS X 10.11 El Capitan Beta"  <answer215234> I have this when opening a VMWare folder codeVirtual Machines.localized/code and not sure why it is happening.  It seems to coincide with the following log:  precode11/11/15 09:59:14.044 CoreServicesUIAgent[4730]: Error -60005 creating authorization /code/pre  Also, when I do a Cmd-I to view the folder info, there was a user that was stuck as "Fetching..." in the permissions list. Removing it and applying permissions down did nothing.  I moved the files in that folder out into a new folder, deleted the one with the issue, and renamed it back and everything is fine now. Go figure.  <answer229355> The cause emmight/em be that the file/folder was downloaded.  In any case, you can remove the 'quarantine' status with  codexattr -d com.apple.quarantine "/path/to/Geometry.pdf"/code  you can add the code-r/code flag to make it recursive, in case you still have trouble.  <comment240853> Please include the exact build version so we can best help you <comment259932> maybe run first aid from disk utility to see if there's any issue? also, judging from the logo, which is the security & privacy preference panel, do you have filevault encryption turned on? <comment259971> I have the same issue, with .doc, .saver (screensaver), even some folders would open with the Verifying dialog.
