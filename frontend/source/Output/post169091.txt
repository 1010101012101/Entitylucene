What keeps waking my Mac up from sleep? <body> My Mac constantly wakes itself up from sleep for apparently no reason. Middle of the night, middle of that day, it just can't stay asleep. Why? I ran codepmset/code with the following results:  precode[redacted]:~ [redacted]$  pmset -g assertions 2015-01-26 08:27:29 -0800  Assertion status system-wide:    BackgroundTask                 0    ApplePushServiceTask           0    UserIsActive                   1    PreventUserIdleDisplaySleep    0    PreventSystemSleep             0    ExternalMedia                  1    PreventUserIdleSystemSleep     0    NetworkClientActive            0 Listed by owning process:    pid 72(hidd): [0x0000b0bc000906ce] 18:03:19 UserIsActive named: "com.apple.iohideventsystem.queue.tickle"     pid 26(powerd): [0x000000230008012c] 43:45:02 ExternalMedia named: "com.apple.powermanagement.externalmediamounted"  Kernel Assertions: 0x10c=USB,BT-HID,MAGICWAKE    id=501  level=255 0x4=USB mod=1/24/15, 12:48 PM description=EHC1 owner=AppleUSBEHCI    id=503  level=255 0x100=MAGICWAKE mod=1/26/15, 6:47 AM description=en0 owner=en0    id=504  level=255 0x8=BT-HID mod=12/31/69, 4:00 PM description=com.apple.driver.IOBluetoothHIDDriver owner=BNBTrackpadDevice    id=506  level=255 0x8=BT-HID mod=12/31/69, 4:00 PM description=com.apple.driver.IOBluetoothHIDDriver owner=AppleBluetoothHIDKeyboard /code/pre  <answer169095> As for what:  The message codeKernel Assertions: 0x10c=USB,BT-HID,MAGICWAKE/code says it.  Also the codeExternalMedia/code is set to wake it up over your USBbluetooth. connection.  So you have a device (BT keyboard) that does that.  As for why:  You BT track pad wakes up (do you have a Cat?) other BT devices interference, low battery... see this for more.  To test do "Allow Bluetooth devices to wake this computer" OFF.  If you have the Magicwake app installed, remove it.  <comment198513> What version of Mac OS X and what model Mac? Have you tried resetting or turing off the BT keyboard (take out the battery for a few minutes to reset)? If you have a late model Mac and Lion or later, perhaps Powernap (http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT5394) is doing its bit? <comment198550> Ah, yes I have a bluetooth keyboard and bluetooth trackpad, I think one or both is low on battery.  Thanks! <comment198552> As answered below, it was the BT keyboard running out of batteries.
