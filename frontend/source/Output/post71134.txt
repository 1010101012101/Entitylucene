21" Screencasting <body> I started screen-casting for YouTube but stumbled upon a dilemma.  When viewing one of my videos on YouTube, the text is impossible to read because my monitor is too big. Of course there's the option of full-screen HD, but only some users like that.  My question is, how can I record for YouTube at the best possible quality without having to go into full-screen mode?  Thanks for your help in advance,br / Mikey  <answer71139> Lower your screen resolution by going to System Preferences  Displays
