What is the name of the iOS browser app that automatically navigates to the URL that is on the clipboard upon launch? <body> There is an iOS browser app that will emautomatically navigate to a URL upon app launch if there is a URL on the clipboard/em but I cannot remember the app. Does anyone know?  <answer114916> Mercury (free, or $0.99 pro version) will prompt you to open a copied URL on launch. You tap "Okay" and it opens a new tab in the foreground containing the page.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IMu4s.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  I haven't been able to find an iOS browser which automatically opens the URL on the clipboard with no user action.  <comment134471> This must be a jailbreak application, no? <comment134568> @AndrewLarsson Why do you say that?
