Right click on Dock icons in Mission Control <body> When I right click on an icon in the Dock, I get a menu as usual (New Window, Options, Quit, etc.). When I right click an an icon in the Dock in Mission Control nothing happens.  strongHow can I enable the right-click menu for Dock app icons while in Mission control?/strong  <answer69251> It seems that you cannot right click a Dock icon while in Mission Control.  <answer69262> Clicking and holding on the dock icon will open the context menu, though it will also dismiss Mission Control at the same time (but that still saves you the step of having to dismiss Mission Control yourself first).  <comment80487> Perhaps there is a hack/interface app or some sort?
