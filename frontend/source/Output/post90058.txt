How to customize Finder's Share menu? <body> Is there a way to add custom services to Finder's Share menu?  I have created an automator service to copy selected files to my Dropbox directory (similar to this).  I enabled this service in the keyboard preferences.  Now I want to add this service in the Share menu rather than having it in the general contextual menu.  <answer91626> From this tip, it looks like you need to edit:  precode/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/ShareKit.framework/Versions/A/Resources/SHKServicesOrder.plist /code/pre  Don't have a Mac in front of me to try it.  <answer91633> I haven't tried it but I would suggestion following :   ol liCopy your automator service in code/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/ShareKit.framework/Versions/A/PlugIns//code/li lirename it codeServicename.sharingservice/code/li liNow edit code/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/ShareKit.framework/Versions/A/Resources/SHKServicesOrder.plist/code by adding your service. (CFBundleIdentifier in Info.plist + function name) /li /ol  <answer92055> I don't think its possible, at least in a "conventional" way. That contextual menu is populated by adding accounts to the Mail, Contacts &amp; Calendar preference pane, not sure if its even possible to build a workaround for that.  <comment107881> I tried just copying the Facebook service and renaming it, and adding it to the plist file, but it didn't show up anywhere. <comment107882> I also tried logging out and back in, but nothing changed. I have a feeling that the particular share services need to be requested by the app.
