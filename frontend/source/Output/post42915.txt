Complete documentation of the iOS Settings app's URL scheme <body> The iOS Settings app provides an URL scheme (codeprefs:/code) which can be used to open the app directly on a particular page from other apps, in particular, shortcut apps such as Launch Center.  There are various pages on the web that have a list of some of the URLs, but these pages all seem to provide the same subset, and I know there is at least one shortcut that's not included. In fact, I'd imagine that emevery/em page in Settings will have it's own URL.  Can anyone provide the complete list of URLs for the Settings app?  <answer42951> A lot of the previous App URL structures seemed to have changed with the iOS 5.01 update, at least for the for the native settings.   For example,   precode prefs:root=General&amp;path=Bluetooth /code/pre  now returns a "URL could not be opened".  <answer42955> precode    About – prefs:root=General&amp;path=About     Accessibility – prefs:root=General&amp;path=ACCESSIBILITY      Airplane Mode On – prefs:root=AIRPLANE_MODE      Auto-Lock – prefs:root=General&amp;path=AUTOLOCK     Brightness – prefs:root=Brightness     Bluetooth – prefs:root=General&amp;path=Bluetooth     Date &amp; Time – prefs:root=General&amp;path=DATE_AND_TIME     FaceTime – prefs:root=FACETIME     General – prefs:root=General      Keyboard – prefs:root=General&amp;path=Keyboard      iCloud – prefs:root=CASTLE      iCloud Storage &amp; Backup – prefs:root=CASTLE&amp;path=STORAGE_AND_BACKUP     International – prefs:root=General&amp;path=INTERNATIONAL     Location Services – prefs:root=LOCATION_SERVICES     Music – prefs:root=MUSIC     Music Equalizer – prefs:root=MUSIC&amp;path=EQ     Music Volume Limit – prefs:root=MUSIC&amp;path=VolumeLimit      Network – prefs:root=General&amp;path=Network      Nike + iPod – prefs:root=NIKE_PLUS_IPOD      Notes – prefs:root=NOTES     Notification – prefs:root=NOTIFICATIONS_ID      Phone – prefs:root=Phone     Photos – prefs:root=Photos      Profile – prefs:root=General&amp;path=ManagedConfigurationList      Reset – prefs:root=General&amp;path=Reset     Safari – prefs:root=Safari     Siri – prefs:root=General&amp;path=Assistant     Sounds – prefs:root=Sounds     Software Update – prefs:root=General&amp;path=SOFTWARE_UPDATE_LINK     Store – prefs:root=STORE      Twitter – prefs:root=TWITTER      Usage – prefs:root=General&amp;path=USAGE     VPN – prefs:root=General&amp;path=Network/VPN      Wallpaper – prefs:root=Wallpaper     Wi-Fi – prefs:root=WIFI /code/pre  strongBUT/strong embe warned/em, none of it works any more as of yesterday and the iOS5.1 update.  <comment49295> This is just the same incomplete list that I provided links to in my question. It doesn't include, for example `prefs:root=INTERNET_TETHERING`. <comment49303> Beg your pardon, I thought it was expanded, however the pertinent part of the answer still stands.  This no longer works on current software levels. <comment49306> Yup. That fact makes my whole question a bit pointless. Hopefully this will get reinstated at some point. It was a very useful feature! <comment58484> Ahem... 5.0.1... <comment290467> Works for me with iOS 9.  I wanted to go directly to accessibility and it works great.
