El Capitan - Right Click Menu - Open Terminal Here <body> I know this may have been asked several times, however I cannot find a valid method that will work for me.  On El Capitan - I want to add a option to the right click menu (not the services section) that allows me to open a file or directory directly in terminal from the right click option.   Would somebody be able to provide a working method?  <answer217521> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9fKnp.png" alt="Exhibit A"  As already mentioned in comments, using the built in service definitely works for folders. As for files, if you were to open them in finder, nothing would happen unless you can first established default editors in your code.bash_profile/code.  If you're not dead set on using the right click menu, one way to open a folder location or file with terminal without downloading additional software would be to drag a file or folder onto your Terminal icon in the Dock. I do this often and it works great.  <answer217793> When I upgraded to El Capitan, I was able to open terminal at finder as I was before and never had to try to make it work again.  <answer217814> As an addition You can add codealias/code in Your code.bash_profile/code:  precodealias cdf="eval \"cd \\\"\\\`osascript -e 'tell app \\\\\\\"Finder\\\\\\\" to return the POSIX path of (target of window 1 as alias)'\\\`\\\"\"" /code/pre  This will not solve your problem, but You can use existing Terminal window and codecd/code to selected directory in Finder by codecdf/code command.  <answer229073> Here is a small tool that will do the job: https://github.com/qparis/FinderOpenTerminal  <answer238566> There are more utilities of this kind available. E.g. Go2Shell is also a possibility.  <comment262243> What's wrong with Services? It already exists as an option there. <comment262244> @Tetsujin - So far it doesn't allow me to open a file in terminal. Only Folders. I previously used XtraFinder which no longer works on El Capitan without disabling a seucrity feature of el capitan. <comment262247> hmmâ€¦ ok. The service is actually 'Open Terminal at Folder' so I guess you're right <comment262275> How do you want to open the file in terminal? <comment262837> What would you expect it to do with a file? <comment292619> Can you please go in depth, for example describe what Go2Shell can do? <comment354016> I prefer this method. Just wanted to note that this is using the last active window if there are multiple windows open.
