Where can I find a single parent emoji? <body> Is there a single parent emoji anywhere, maybe from a third-party app? I mean, not all kids have two parents.  <answer206857> Emojipedia doesn't seem to think such an emoji exists. Sorry!  <comment249351> The question is (obviously) is there a single parent emoji in another app than the default one? From what I understand. <comment249352> What did your Internet search reveal? What homework have you done? The default emoji keyboard on iOS 9 doesn't have one.  Submit feedback to Apple if you wish. <comment249547> With no wish to actually be cynical about this this question - the reticence to provide Single Parent emojis may be that they could also be considered 'Jimmy Saville' emojis.
