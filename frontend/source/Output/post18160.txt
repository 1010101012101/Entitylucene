How do I take a steathy picture with my iSight camera from the command line? <body> Is there a command line utility that allows me to take a picture from the built in camera?  Something like screencapture allows for, well, screen captures.  The reasoning for a command line tool is I would like for it to be stealthy, without a countdown or flash or other indication to the user that a picture is being taken.  <answer18161> OS X does not come with any utilities for this purpose.  A third-party solution is imagesnap. It lets you capture an image from any connected video device, defaulting to the built-in iSight camera. It's available as a single binary file you could bundle with your software, and is released into the public domain.  There are many references around the internet to the iSightCapture utility, which used to be a popular choice for this, but it is no longer maintained.  <answer22690> Natively, there is a way but it is extremely basic. You can use Automator to make an application that takes a picture. The action is called "Take Video Snapshot" and requires a "built-in camera, iSight or other webcam, or digital camera connected to your computer." Just check the box to codetake picture automatically/code and you now have an app you can call from the command line. Save it as an app and then you can call it from the command line like codeopen TakePicture.app/code.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ND6d9.png" alt="Take Video Snapshot"  <answer23040> As another poster mentioned there is a utility called iSightCapture which can do this.  I once wrote a script to periodically grab an iSight image and a grab of my two monitors and post it to a private website so I could see what's going on at my computer.  Here's how I scripted iSightCapture to do so.  precode#!/bin/bash ~/scripts/isightcapture -w 320 -h 240 -t jpg ~/capture.jpg  RESULT=$? if [ $RESULT -ne 0 ]; then     growlnotify -s -a FaceTime -m "isightcapture failed ($RESULT)" $0     exit 1 else     sips -f horizontal ~/capture.jpg fi  screencapture -S -tjpg ~/scr1.jpg ~/scr2.jpg  RESULT=$? if [ $RESULT -ne 0 ]; then     growlnotify -s -a FaceTime -m "screencapture failed ($RESULT)" $0     exit 2 else      sips -z 240 320 ~/scr1.jpg      sips -z 240 320 ~/scr2.jpg fi exit 0 /code/pre  Note the use of 'sips' to flip the isight capture horizontally.    A working download link (2012-10-05): iSightCapture (via), tested on OSX 10.8.2  <answer39665> Use imagesnap. It can be installed with codebrew install imagesnap/code or by downloading the binary from the website.  One use for it is to take series of snapshots:  precodewhile :; do     imagesnap ~/Desktop/$(date +%y%m%d%H%M%S).png     sleep ${1-1} done /code/pre  It doesn't crop images horizontally either. (Photo Booth changes the aspect ratio to 3:2.)  <answer270968> Unfortunately codeimagesnap/code no longer appears to work on OSX10.11/El Capitan so another alternative is to install ffmpeg (MacPorts: codeport install ffmpeg/code or codebrew install ffmpeg/code) and run:  precodeffmpeg -f avfoundation -video_size 1280x720 -framerate 30 -i "0" -vframes 1 out.jpg /code/pre  <comment19820> Anything native? <comment19821> @dacracot Unfortunately Apple hasn't provided anything like this. <comment25902> Tried this and it worked, but I was hoping for something more stealthy. <comment25906> @dacracot I figured as much. Like I said, this is the only native way I know of so you'll have to go the hard route if you want stealth. <comment57353> Take a look at the source code for http://preyproject.com/ -- they do this stuff with their app and the code for it is open source. <comment78143> Remember that the green LED next to the iSight will briefly activate when the camera records the image. <comment235634> Also note that `imagesnap` has a `-t` flag to take a picture every `x.xx` seconds. So that while loop could be replaced with `imagesnap -t 1`; though, in this case, `imagesnap` will generate its own filename (e.g. `snapshot-00000-2015-07-23_10-36-52.853.jpg`). <comment269630> if you plan to use `imagesnap` via ssh, you'll need sudo privileges.  I use it to check in on my cats.
