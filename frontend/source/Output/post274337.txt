Anyone know of a single-pane Markdown editor for MacOS <body> Just looking for an markdown editor that is one pane, and will let me toggle back-and-forth between "edit mode" and "display mode" with a keyboard shortcut.  I really how the cells in python's Jupyter notebooks can be toggled back and forth between markdown content, and want to duplicate that behavior.  <answer274339> Check out MacDown, it is free and although it has possibility to show edit both panes, you can close one pane using kbdShift/kbd + kbdCmd/kbd + kbdH/kbd and then you can switch between edit and display mode using kbdShift/kbd + kbdCmd/kbd + kbdE/kbd.  Hope it helps!  <answer286596> There is an app that might work out for you, called Versatil Markdown (https://versatilapp.com).  It has a display mode and an edit mode, toggled with kbdcmd-return/kbd.  Might be worth checking out if you're still looking.  <comment344908> See [this post](http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/a/2181/88313) for important guidelines that should be followed when asking for a software recommendation.
