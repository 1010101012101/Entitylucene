How can I keep my Mac awake AND locked? <body> I want to leave my Mac awake overnight so it syncs 4GB of data from Dropbox. I need to prevent the machine from going to sleep because that pauses the Dropbox sync  I've been using Caffeine to keep the computer awake, but it also keeps the computer unlocked which is insecure.  I need a method to keep my Mac awake (so that Dropbox can sync overnight) but also locked (so no one can read my email). It'd be great if this method emalso/em turned off the screen (to preserve power), but honestly that's not even 100% necessary.  <answer76108> ol liIn System Preferences  Energy Saver, check the box for "Prevent computer from sleeping automatically when the display is off" (on laptops, this is under the Power Adapter tab)/li liIn System Preferences  Security &amp; Privacy, check the box for "Require password after sleep or screen saver begins" and set the delay in the dropdown menu to "immediately"/li /ol  Now, you can hit kbdcommand/kbd-kbdoption/kbd-kbdpower/kbd to turn off the display without sleeping the computer, and doing anything that turns on the display (like hitting a key or clicking a mouse button) will prompt you for your account password.  <answer127991> Wimoweh $$ will automatically keep your mac awake when user selectable processes are running and will control the display sleeping (or not) as well.    <answer186300> You can try "Lock Me Now" app from the app store. It gives a pretty neat way to lock the mac.   <answer270962> If you don't use an Apple keyboard, you can lock it with the mouse by selecting your name in the right-side of the menubar and click codeLogin Window.../code  <comment149976> Note this is control-shift-power on newer macs without an eject key <comment169382> With external keyboard without the eject key, one can check the `Show keychain status in menu bar` option in Keychain Access App's Preferences. Then you will be able to `Lock Screen` in the menu bar by clicking the lock icon. <comment210031> If I change the setting to never go to sleep, will the MacBook still go to sleep if I manually tell it to? <comment264601> In Yosemite, there is an option named *Prevent computer from sleeping automatically when the display is off" in System Preferences  Energy Saver. <comment268972> @NobleUplift Yes, of course. <comment277947> So the computer is still awake when the display is off and locked? Does it keep working when in the password prompt window? And this would apply to keeping scripts (python and php in terminal) running? <comment279357> Yes. Locking access to your device and/or keychain does not stop other processes from running. <comment286058> Note: The Energy Saver settings are different now than when this question was answered. OS X no longer provides a way to prevent computers from sleeping while on battery power in the UI. Here is a screenshot of the current Preference pane in OS X 10.11.4: [Energy Saver](http://i.imgur.com/G8vFybQ.gifv) <comment300684> We like answers to be more than just a single line.
