Adobe Acrobat opens whenever I save a PDF file. Please make it stop! <body> So. I installed Acrobet. I generally like it for dealing with large PDF files. However, since I've installed it, is insists on opening emevery time/em I download a PDF from Chrome.  I'm sure this is a silly-ass setting somewhere, but I've not found it.  Help?  strongUpdate/strong  The exact behavior is that I look at the PDF in Chrome, then "Save As" to save it.  At that point the Adobe Acrobat takes over.  Sadly, codechrome://plugins//code is no help.  See screenshot attached:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8WmmN.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer203054> You can disable/remove the Adobe PDF plugin from chrome://plugins/.  As part of the installation of Adobe Acrobat, there is an option to Customise the install and choose whether to install the plugin. It's enabled by default.  <comment244889> Are you opening the PDF from finder or is chrome pushing the download to open in the app? <comment244912> See above, there's no adobe plugin listed. <comment244957> the PDF automatically opens in Acrobat after downloading.
