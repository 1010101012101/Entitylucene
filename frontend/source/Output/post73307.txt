I deleted songs right off my iPod, why are they again in my iPod after syncing? <body> I have 887 songs in my iTunes library, and last night I deleted some of them right off my iPod touch, 4th generation. At the end I got 769, and in the morning I connected my iPod to iTunes, I did some changes that had nothing to do with my music, because they were fine, but then I clicked sync and again, the songs I deleted from my Ipod were again in my iPod! how do I sync my iPod to actually "update" my iTunes library, I don't want to delete the music again or do I need to delete the same songs from my iTunes library too?  <answer73317> You need to tell iTunes not to sync those songs.   ol liUncheck the songs you do not want to sync in the iTunes "Music" list./li liCheck "Sync only checked songs and Videos" in the options for the device./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/z8EFv.png" alt="item checkbox"  <comment301344> "sync only checked songs and videos" is grayed out for me.
