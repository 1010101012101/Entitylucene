My Macbook falls asleep everytime that I pick it up? <body> If my MacBook is sitting on the desk and I go and pick it up, it will fall asleep and will not wake up regardless of pressing space bar or pressing the power button. Literally the only way I can get it to work is by shaking the macbook (I then hear a soft single beep) and then I place it back on the desk and then hit the laptop lightly against the desk and it will wake up. What is the problem and is there anyway I could fix it. (I feel like the beeping noise might mean something when it is in sleep mode?)   Anyways my Macbook is a late 2011 Macbook Pro and it is on 10.7.5. Thanks  <answer123811> It sounds like it might need repairs; there could be a loose ribbon cable inside that's disconnecting when you move it.  That said, the whole scenario sounds mysteriously uncommon.  <comment100597> @jadav This and a couple of other comments are not constructive.
