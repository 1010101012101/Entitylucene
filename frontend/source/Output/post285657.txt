How can I set up an Apple TV (4th gen) connection to a PPTP/L2TP VPN? <body> I have in the offices an Apple TV with a custom app that allows each office to see a dashboard with data.   The problem is that this data is in the main server, in the office headquarters. Is there any way I can setup a PPTP/L2TP VPN connection (something always on) in the Apple TV so that the app could gather the data from the main server?  PS. Opening the data in a public link or changing the app is not an option.   <answer285659> One way to do this is to use a router or Mac to connect to the VPN and then share that connection with the Apple TV.  Below is strongone example/strong of how you could do this using a Mac. This should also give you the basic idea if you need to do something similar with a Windows machine or routersup1/sup.  strongShare VPN from a Mac/strong  ol liConnect your Mac to the internet via ethernet cable (i.e. connect it to a router, modem, etc via ethernet)/li liSet up your VPN connection in System Preferences  Network (obviously you'll need the address and authentication details to do this)/li liClick on the kbdAdvanced.../kbd button/li liEnsure you tick the emSend all traffic over VPN connection/em checkbox/li liYou will also want to make sure that the two emDisconnect/em options are not enabled/li liClick kbdOK/kbd/li liEnsure you also tick the checkbox for emShow VPN status in menu bar/em/li liNow go to System Preferences  Sharing/li liHighlight (but do not tick) the Internet Sharing service in the lefthand pane/li liOn the righthand side, select the VPN connection you created at Step 2 from the emShare your connection from/em drop-down menu/li liNow select the Wi-Fi port (i.e. tick the checkbox)/li liClick on the kbdWi-Fi Options.../kbd button/li liGive your new Wi-Fi network a name, password etc/li liClick kbdOK/kbd/li liNow tick the Internet Sharing service in the lefthand pane/li /ol  sup1/sup It's impossible to give you precise steps as routers vary significantly. However you would need to ensure your router is capable of doing this and will need to refer to its user guide.  strongNOTES:/strong   ul liYou can also share a Wi-Fi connection via ethernet (although I suspect that's not practical in the case of a Mac  Apple TV./li liIf you can't connect your Mac to a router/modem via ethernet at Step 1, you could use a Ethernet to Wireless adapter instead. This just means the adapter is connecting to your usual Wi-Fi network and that you're connecting your Mac to the adapter via Ethernet./li liSince you want this to be an emalways on/em connection, it'd mean your Mac will need to always remain on. It's also why Step 5 above is important. You emmay/em also need to adjust your System Preferences  Energy Saver settings./li /ul  Now, whenever your Mac is connected to the VPN, it will share the connection via Wi-Fi. This means you can connect any device to the new Wi-Fi network you created at Step 13 (such as your Apple TV).   strongUsing the VPN connection/strong  To make this work with your Apple TV:  ol liOn the Mac, click on the new VPN Status icon in the menu bar/li liSelect the Connect option pertaining to the VPN connection created previously/li liOnce the connection is established, your Wi-Fi icon in the menu bar will change to indicate your Mac is now sharing the VPN via Wi-Fi/li liNow go to your Apple TV and connect it to this Wi-Fi network/li /ol  <comment360446> Great! I think I'll use this option, but using a small and cheap router just to connect to the VPN and let the Apple TV connect to the server. The apple configurator app have some vpn options.. would that work?
