No Calendars Sync - iCloud or Google <body> I have two Macs, and iPhone and iPad. I have setup iCloud and Google accounts with Calendars on all of them. Its works everywhere, syncs and loads up great, except for 1 Mac.  One of them just won't sync any calendars, be it iCloud or Google. I enable the Google Account and then I just get no calendars download and appear.  Any help much appreciated, thanks.  <answer276215> On your Mac that isn't syncing, go to System Preferences  Internet Accounts. From the list of accounts in the left column of the screen, select the account that isn't syncing in. Make sure that "Calendars" is checked.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ibovY.png" alt="enter image description here"  Next, open your Calendars app. Click "Calendar" (next to the Apple icon in the menu bar)  Preferences (NOTE: Clicking "Accounts" instead of "Preferences" will just send you back to System Preferences  Internet Accounts). In the Preferences pane, click "Accounts". Select the account that wasn't syncing. Then make sure that "Enable this account" is checked.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/svPQU.png" alt="enter image description here"  If the calendar still isn't appearing, make sure that you're not hiding the calendar. There is a toggle button in the Calendar app that hides or shows the list of calendars available to display. If you cannot see a list of calendars on the left column of your Calendar app, then click the "Calendars" button in the top left corner of your Calendar app. This will display a list of calendars on the left side of the app. Make sure that your missing calendars are checked. Unchecked calendars will not show up in your calendar view.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kjmqu.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment347646> Thanks but this doesn't resolve anything. These are basic instructions for displaying your Calendars, not a resolution for ones that are not syncing as in my case.
