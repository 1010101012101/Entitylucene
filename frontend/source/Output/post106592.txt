Why are my preferences reset after restart with Mavericks? <body> My desktop wallpaper, the desktop icons - the file preview icon goes away, my default sound device, all get reset back to the default after a restart.  I removed the com.apple.desktop.plist from the Library folder, but it still reset.  How can I fix this?  <answer107433> Have you tried repairing the permissions on your home folder?

Are you sure you are not on a "Guest" account? <comment180444> I have noticed a couple of settings (Safari, for instance) being reset after reboot, since I upgraded to Mavericks. I wonder if it has to do with the dreaded cached preferences thing introduced in 10.9...
