Want to create a custom-named folder fram a selection of files. What are my options? <body> I have a large number of files, and I want to create custom-named folder from a selection, where the selection can vary in number of files.  I would like to name the folder with the name of the 1st file, based on either time-stamp or the incremental name. If possible, I also would like to add info from the EXIF-data to the folder name.  Preferably, I would like to have a short-cut and maybe also a selection from a right-click menu, to access the creation of a folder.  What are my options?  ul listrongAppleScript?/strong I tried different examples from the net w/o any success. Have not read that much about it. Is it possible?/li listrongAutomater?/strong Same here as with AppleScript. Is it possible?/li listrongBuild my own app using Xcode and Swift?/strong Not a professional, but I can handle it. Not sure if it is possible to have it accessible from short-cut, or if I need to make it work in another way. Is it possible? Is it much work?/li listrongAny other options?/strong/li /ul  strongNote:/strong Of course I appreciate a complete solution, but I don't expect that. I want to know what my options are, and what can be done.  Thanks in advance!
