Re-enable default action for right Shift button <body> Once upon a time I set the right Shift action to "Show Desktop"  I don't like it anymore and want to re-enable the default action for the right Shift key.  I tried via System Preferences but without success  Give me a clue, please?  <comment232161> are you saying it is not in the syst pref -keyboard-shortcuts ? <comment232196> I'd guess you did it with something like Karabiner, as you can't differentiate R/L shift in System Prefs. <comment232199> I can't find in syst pref -keyboard-shortcuts, and can't to replace with something else, when click right shift in field to put new new combination, it does showing desktop <comment232201> I expected to find some textual config file, where all shortcuts are gathered and manually remove this shortcut <comment232210> I fix this with karabiner, but I don't like that fix. I need karabiner to be lauched always now. <comment232211> how can I do it natively?
