How much use can you get from an Apple Watch if you don't have (or plan to get) an iPhone? <body> The Apple Watch uses an iPhone for network connectivity (WiFi) and GPS, and reportedly will have some basic capabilities when you don't have an iPhone nearby.

So if you want it for the features above then yes.  If you do not plan to get a iPhone ever, then NO.  <comment170783> I'm skeptical of claims that it can use Apple Pay without a connection to the phone, because as far as I know, the phone won't transmit information required to create the one-time payment tokens.
