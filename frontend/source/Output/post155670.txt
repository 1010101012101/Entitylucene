Keyboard shortcut to dismiss notifications <body> I'd like to be able to dismiss and open notifications with the keyboard  (Not talking about opening/closing the notification center)  Is this possible? And if so, how?  <answer155681> Not quite what you asking for:  You could limit the time displayed for banners type with  Terminal and paste in the following  codedefaults write com.apple.notificationcenterui bannerTime #/code  with the # number sign replaced with the amount of seconds you want banner notifications to stick around, then log off and back on.  To restore original function (5 seconds) use codedefaults delete com.apple.notificationcenterui bannerTime/code  I know you said no: but you could strongcycle/strong the Notification on/off with a script and assign a keyboard short cut to it. Temporarily disable Notification Center in Mountain Lion from command line?  <answer155736> You can create Automator service to run this Applescript and give it a keyboard shortcut in the System Preferences Keyboard shortcuts  This will close Alert and banners Notification  hr  In Automator choose a new service  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MfD6H.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  Add a Run Applescript Action   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/caxzg.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  and replace it's code with:  precodemy closeNotif() on closeNotif()      tell application "System Events"         tell process "Notification Center"             set theWindows to every window             repeat with i from 1 to number of items in theWindows                 set this_item to item i of theWindows                 try                     click button 1 of this_item                 on error                      my closeNotif()                 end try             end repeat         end tell     end tell  end closeNotif /code/pre  hr  Set the 'Service receives [no input] in [any application]'  Save the service.  hr  Open the Keyboard shortcuts in System prefs and set your for your service under 'Services' img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/H1AAd.png" alt="enter image description here"  Now any newly launched app will pick the shortcut up.  (Note: I structured the script to counter throwing an error that will occur when the notifications/windows start to close.  otifications/window are numbered 1 through to the total count. But as they close the script would still be working of the old count.  But the system will be re assigning the index of the windows.  So where we say start at 1 -6 the script will try and close window 1, window 2, window 3 and so on. But the system has re assigned the window numbers 1,2,3 to the last remaining windows. But the script will try and close window 4 and throw an error because it does not exist. The script will catch this and deal with it. )  hr  If you want to click the 'Show' button on an Alert Notification. you change the button you click from 1 to 2.  precodeclick button 2 of this_item /code/pre  Banner notifications do not have a button 2.  But you can just click the window.  So this code should take care of Showing.  precodemy closeNotif() on closeNotif()      tell application "System Events"         tell process "Notification Center"             set theWindows to every window             repeat with i from 1 to number of items in theWindows                 set this_item to item i of theWindows                 set cnt to count buttons of this_item                 try                     if cnt &gt; 1 then                          click button 2 of this_item                     else                         click this_item                     end if                 on error                      closeNotif()                 end try             end repeat         end tell     end tell  end closeNotif /code/pre  <comment183221> Thanks, this is really cool. The one thing it's missing is how to also open a notification rather than close it... is that something you could add, and I will gladly accept your answer! <comment183227> @Drewdavid updated the answer :-) <comment183498> Did you see that update you asked for? <comment183592> Thanks for posting; the time limit is also worth noting here :) <comment184876> Hi, after a day or two of using this, I'm getting the following in a dialog box: "The action “Run AppleScript” encountered an error." Screen cap here: http://grab.by/ClAw This is true for both the open and close actions. <comment184887> @Drewdavid How odd. It still is working in mine. What do you get if you run it in Automator <comment222971> I think on banner this will click and trigger whatever action is behind the notification -- is it possible just to dismiss and not trigger these actions? <comment260877> @markhunte i'm getting the same thing as Drewdavid "The action “Run AppleScript” encountered an error." It runs fine in automator, but not from a shortcut. Any ideas? <comment271301> Drewdavid: I am having the same problem, and gave up fixing it under Security & Privacy and just set up a global hot-key through BetterTouchTool.
