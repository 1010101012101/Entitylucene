Syncing without deleting <body> I got mt iPhone last september, and I never synced it to a computer. If i do so now will it erase everything on my iPhone or can i just do it? My sister says you can just as long as I havent synced it to a computer. Im connected to iCloud if that helps and I have backed up my storage.  <answer141695> You can definitely sync your iPhone to your computer, without having to worry about the data that is currently on your phone. In fact, backing up and restoring all the data currently on your device is done by syncing with iTunes (or iCloud).   <comment166994> What computer and iTunes are you syncing?
