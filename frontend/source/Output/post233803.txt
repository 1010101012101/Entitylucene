How do I find a recently added contact? <body> I recently met someone and got them to type their info into my contacts.  I was really busy for a few days and didn't get around to contacting them.  Now I can't remember their name.  Is there a way to view the most recent additions to my contacts list?  <answer233873> The built-in contacts app doesn't provide a user-friendly way to search by 'most recent'.  This app is very basic and is good for most users but, as you've experienced, if you need something a bit more advanced, it won't work as well.  You can try doing a Spotlight search by the location you were at or by the company that person works for, any little thing they might've added to their contact on your iPhone.  If none of those approaches work, and you're not willing to jailbreak to get access to the Contacts database, you can try going thru each name one-by-one until you see it.  It's slow and annoying, but it works.  <answer233920> I've discovered a free app called iContacts+ (there are several such apps, I just grabbed the first that didn't look too ghastly).  It allowed me to search by most recent addition.  <answer261995> I've made an app to see recently added contacts. It's not free, but apart from those others, it has a widget.  <answer262614> Contacts by creation app from appstore is all you need.  <answer276294> On iPhone, you can download several different apps.  The one I found was free, quick, and simple called 'Recent Contacts' by Kyle Gorlick.   On Android there are also several apps, but I have not tried them myself.  <answer276410> Recents is another that's available on the iPhone that I find attractive.  It's also well reviewed with 4.5/5 stars from 14 reviewers.  I haven't personally had cause to try it.  <answer281020> I add my contacts to a Group I created called "recent contacts" and then remove them after I synch to salesforce database or tag them with the info needed to recall them. Its a non-app workaround but works for me.  <comment285888> I've discovered that there's a IFTTT recipe that adds a note in my calendar whenever I add a new contact.  In the future that will take care of the issue. <comment285898> That's good to hear!

I tried a different app which I added in an answer below: http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/276294/194618 <comment347850> It appears to be so.  iContacts+ is no longer available.  I have withdrawn my answer. <comment347851> Rather than attempting to keep up to date I'll leave it up to the community to select the best answer with their votes.  Therefore I will abstain from selecting an answer to the question in the future. <comment347852> Recent Contacts does have In-App-Purchases, or at least one for $2 called "Mystery Features".  Don't know what that's about.
