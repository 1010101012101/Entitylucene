Can Touch ID for the Mac Touch Bar authenticate sudo users and admin privileges? <body> ul liDoes Touch ID for the MacBook Pro 2016 Touch Bar support elevating admin privileges in macOS?/li liSomewhat differently, can the Touch ID give sudo access in Terminal?/li /ul  I'm guessing that the former may be possible, but probably not the latter since it depends on string input.  I wonder this because I'm considering getting a YubiKey which can do string input to password fields, but Touch ID for Macs may render it unnecessary.  <answer262890> 1) TouchID does support elevating privileges, but as of now, it only seems to be supported in Apple's own apps. My guess is that 3rd party apps will have to be updated to support it, unfortunately. I still end up typing in my password a lot.  2) This PAM module will let you use TouchID for sudo in the terminal: https://github.com/hamzasood/pam_touchid  <comment326910> check this out: https://github.com/mattrajca/sudo-touchid <comment327249> @pathikrit - close but it looks like a PAM module would be a much better solution than a forked sudo. I haven't seen any that have been written yet; I may try my hand at it <comment340021> Has anyone actually done this? Looks pretty scary :) <comment340053> @NicCottrell yes, working fine on my end
