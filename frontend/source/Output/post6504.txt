How do split panes in Terminal work? <body> I tried to open a split pane to run another command but instead it displays the same in both panes and I can only interact with one of them. I thought it would split the view so I could use the two panes independently like two windows.  I have the Visor installed but I don't think it would interfere.  precodeTerminal - version 2.1.1 Visor custom (84d1873) based on 1.5 /code/pre  <answer6506> It's meant to be like that. See this Super User answer:     You're misinterpreting the feature. It's not meant for two separate   terminals. It's intended to allow a   user to see two different view points   in the same terminal. For instance, if   you have 3000 files in a directory,   and you perform an ls command, that   output is going to be very long.      If you use the split pane, you can   scroll through that long output   without having to flip back and forth,   possibly losing your place along the   way.      If you want two terminals, use tabs,   or separate windows.   I would add that, for two separate terminals, you can use separate tabs as well.  <answer7083> iTerm 2 supports split panes with independent shells in each pane, not one linked shell.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pDYrO.png" alt="Split panes in iTerm 2"  <answer7092> You should really have a look at codescreen/code (that´s an already installed command line tool, not a separate application), which gives you the ability to split your Terminal into two (or more) separate ones. I use that with Visor and it works like a charm. Have a look around here, there are quite a few tips on how to use "screen" on a Mac.  <answer69530> Also don't over look tmux. Its like screen but more features I believe.  <comment6867> this is really disappointing... <comment7556> Supposing you use iTerm 2, would you say that it works "better" than Terminal.app + Visor for a quick "pop-in, do-something, pop-out" workflow? I am a Rails web developer if that helps to visualize my needs. <comment7564> There is always emacs if you are already in Terminal, but the learning curve is a bit steep. <comment7566> @Vrinek not sure. You could still use Visor and iTerm2. <comment80775> Can you add a bit more details to your answer? Why is tmux better, how does it solve to problem and where do I get it if needed? <comment264989> @Mark: or `tmux` or `screen`. <comment264990> This sounds like a feature request to me.

Where? <comment372995> @Eliethesaiyan Sorry, if this was not clear — "here" meant to suggest searching for "screen" on this very website.
