Where is the unavailable disk space? <body> br I recently uninstalled a 120 GB windows 7 (installed and uninstalled via boot camp) on my Mac mini machine. I suspect that part of the disk space used in that installation has been made unavailable. Look at the following terminal commands:  precode$ diskutil list /dev/disk0    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.1 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI                         209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            389.0 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3  $ df -h Filesystem                       Size   Used  Avail Capacity  iused      ifree %iused  Mounted on /dev/disk0s2                    362Gi  319Gi   43Gi    89% 83772049   11198653   88%   / devfs                           200Ki  200Ki    0Bi   100%      693          0  100%   /dev map -hosts                        0Bi    0Bi    0Bi   100%        0          0  100%   /net map auto_home                     0Bi    0Bi    0Bi   100%        0          0  100%   /home /code/pre  The results above show that I am missing 110 GB of disk space. I know that the operating system itself uses space, but I very much doubt that it is that much.  <answer95740> It looks like uninstalling Windows via bootcamp did not merge the space reclaimed by removing the old windows partition into your Macintosh HD one.
