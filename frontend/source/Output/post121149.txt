Mounting an SMB share uses the share name and not the local directory name <body> I'm mounting an SMB share via the command line in 10.9 with the following:  precodemkdir /Volumes/MountName mount_smbfs //user:password@server/Share$/SubDir /Volumes/MountName /code/pre  Previously in 10.8 this would be mounted on the desktop with the codeMountName/code directory name I manually created for the mount point.  Now it's displaying with the remote share name codeShare$/code. The mount point hasn't changed and still appears as code/Volumes/MountName/code.  How can I force the local name of a mounted drive in 10.9?  <answer152314> I think that you might be looking at the /Volumes/ folder with Terminal, right? But it shows the proper name of the same folder using Finder.  The share$ name in /Volumes/ only affects my shell scripts, so I've ignored the difference and life is not too bad ;)  <comment216974> No, the `Share$` is appearing in Finder - the actual path in Terminal is correct.
