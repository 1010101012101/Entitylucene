Change tabstop in TextEdit.app <body> How does one change the tabstop in TextEdit.app for Snow Leopard?   The current tabstop is em8/em spaces. I would like to change this to em4/em spaces.br Is there any way to achieve this?  <answer40045> Yes.   ol liMake sure codeFormat &gt; Text &gt; Show Ruler/code is enabled./li liLocate the tab stops in the ruler (Fig. 1)./li liMove the first one to 1/4 inch (Fig. 2)./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nhtaX.png" alt="Fig1" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CsWsV.png" alt="Fig2" Alternatively, you could use something like Keyboard Maestro, TextExpander, or BetterTouchTool to map four spaces to the Tab key. This is the only way I'm aware of to do it for plain text files (code.txt/code).  <answer165117> strongTextEdit bases its tabs on distances,/strong not number of characters.  If I set the text to 30pt, the tabs are four spaces. At 14pt, they are eight spaces.  Consequently, there is no set "number of spaces" that could ever be modified.  One solution is to:  ol listrongchange your font preferences/strong for RTF files to match my TXT preferences./li litemporarily strongconvert your TXT files to RTF/strong while editing (cmd-shift-T)./li /ol  (do some editing)  ol start="3" listrongconvert back to TXT/strong when you quit (cmd-shift-T)./li /ol  The RTF tabs default to 4 spaces for me -- it depends on the font and size.  <answer165118> A kindly soul has slightly strongmodified TextEdit/strong to add a field, "Tab Width", at the bottom of the "New Document" tab of the "Preferences" window.  Type in a number between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and it will change the width of tabs to that number (in character widths).  Download at strongcode.google.com./strong  Since I couldn't replace the main TextEdit app, strongI used "show package contents" and replaced the inside of the app/strong.  <answer175287> For plaintext tabs, you don't need to replace the entire TextEdit app to change it. I looked at the source they changed and it provides the simpler answer: Open the Terminal and type  codedefaults write com.apple.TextEdit "TabWidth" '4'/code  Where '4' is the number of spaces a tab should be.  <comment45299> If your document has existing content, select all of the content before making this adjustment so the tab stops are applied to all of the paragraphs. <comment45308> This works for rich text documents. It seems not to show a ruler for plain text documents. I'll keep this in mind. Thanks! <comment45327> Oh, sorry, didn't realize it didn't work for .txt files. Oh well! <comment54632> @phwd Added an alternative for .txt files. :) <comment54634> Sweet looking into them now <comment208009> Fantastic, I basically only use it in plaintext mode anyways. Would upvote more if I could :) <comment238178> Nice! Worked perfectly! <comment359251> this should be a selected answer.
