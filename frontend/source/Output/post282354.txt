How to delete ghost photos on iPhone 4? <body> My Camera Roll is empty and so is my Photo Stream, and I've deleted all the photos in my iCloud account. So why can I still see (thousands of) photos via the Photos app? How can I get rid of them?  hr  iPhone: iPhone 4, Version 7.1.2 (11D257)  <comment355678> Which Photos app? On your iPhone 4? On a Mac? <comment355695> @Monomeeth: On my iPhone 4.
