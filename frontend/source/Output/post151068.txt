Where is the OS X Volume Change Feedback Sound File located? <body> I upgraded Yosemite, and turns out they changed the "pop" sound that plays when you change the volume. I have another Mac, which is on Mavericks, and I would like to get the old sound back.  I saw Where are the Mac OS X alert sound files located?, and it is NOT there in Macintosh HD ▸ System ▸ Library ▸ Sounds  Any help would be appreciated.  <answer151079> The volume up/down feedback audio file is called strongvolume.aiff/strong and is located in:  precode/System/Library/LoginPlugins/BezelServices.loginPlugin/Contents/Resources/ /code/pre  <answer154369> Go to codeSystem Preference &gt; Sound/code, and check "Play feedback when volume is changed".  You may have to restart your computer if it doesn't work when you check it. I did and now it works.  <answer200632> The volume up/down feedback audio file is called volume.aiff and is located in:  /System/Library/LoginPlugins/BezelServices.loginPlugin/Contents/Resources/  Then you may need to restart terminal and your computer if you are editing that file.  <comment177757> Thanks very much!  How did you think of looking in there? This information might be useful in other cases too! <comment177759> To be perfectly honest... I googled your question, word for word.  I knew it was in /System/Library, however I didn't remember the exact path. <comment177765> Huh! That's embarassing (for me)! <comment178523> @gunner I was working on this answer, but Patrick was faster by one minute:) I did this in Terminal: `cd /System/Library && find . -name *.aiff`. <comment181893> That wasn't my question. <comment241752> I'm unable to find "LoginPlugins" on my MacBook Pro running OS X 10.10.4 "Yosemite". <comment241764> Verified I have that folder and file (OS X 10.10.5). Odd that it is not on your system.
