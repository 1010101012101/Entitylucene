Locate long file paths on external drive with terminal <body> I need to move a large volume to a new raid server that's PC formatted. However I have a couple paths and filenames that are interrupting this process.  I would just like to know how to use the terminal to:  ol liLocate the targeted external drive/li liThen search that drive for paths/files that are over 130 characters/li /ol  Can anyone help?  I know how to search for long paths find " . -type f -name '?????...*' ", just not sure how to target my external drive.  <answer291177> The following command will print out all files that have more than 130 characters  precodefind -E . -type f -regex '.*[^/]{130}' /code/pre  The Terminal (bash) command to list the disks attached to the system is codediskutil/code.  The command codediskutil list/code will output all disks - just select the identifier that matches your external device.    For example:  precode/dev/disk3 (external, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.1 GB   disk3    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk3s1    2:                  Apple_HFS FreeAgent Go            499.8 GB   disk3s2 /dev/disk4 (external, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk4    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk4s1    2:                  Apple_HFS My Passport for Mac     999.8 GB   disk4s2 /code/pre  codedisk0/code, codedisk1/code, and codedisk2/code are in a CoreStorage volume.  codedisk3/code and codedisk4/code are my external drivers  To access the drive (assuming it's mounted), look in the code/Volumes/code directory for the appropriate mount point.  Assuming you wanted to search "My Passport for Mac" you would enter the command:  precodefind -E /Volumes/My\ Passport\ for\ Mac/ -type f -regex '.*[^/]{130}' /code/pre  <answer291178> The external drive is mounted under code/Volumes/code, run codels /Volumes/code to see the exact name.  Afterwards you can use   precodefind /Volumes/NAME-FROM-ABOVE -print |     while read line; do [[ ${#line} -gt 130 ]] &amp;&amp; echo $line; done /code/pre  to list all files where path and filename combined are longer than 130 characters.  PS: This will not work for file/path names containing new lines and similar stuff (which usually isn't a problem) PPS: If your volume name contains spaces you need to wrap it in code""/code - codefind "/Volumes/LaCie - BRYT" -print .../code  <comment367629> Standard `find` doesn't support `-regextype`, unfortunately. <comment367630> @patrix - you're right...I'm on ssh session to a different machine so of course, when I tested, it worked.  Duh... <comment367631> But `-E` works - `find -E . -type f -regex '.*[^/]{130}'` :-) <comment367632> I was just reading the man page on `-E` when your comment came in.  Unfortunately, I don't have any files that long to *really* test it out with.  Thx! <comment367633> So if my identifier is "disk3s2" how would I write it (sorry very noob). <comment367634> Like this: 'find -disk3s2 . type f -regex '.*[^/]{130}' <comment367635> To clarify, you want to find all files on an external disk longer than 130 chars?  Is that correct? <comment367638> So my volume I'm wanting to target is 'LaCie - BRYT' but I think the name of the volume is messing with my print. I'm getting a return of "unknown primary or operator". <comment367640> See edit. But go with Allan's solution for the whole thing, it's much nicer, slightly faster and will also work for edge cases like file names with new line characters <comment367641> yes, that's my objective. the dive name is LaCie - BIRK and I believe is messing with the command. But I could be wrong, I'm just far too new to know. <comment367643> Ok got it! I was able to run  find "/Volumes/LaCie - BYRT" -print | while read line; do [[ ${#line} -gt 130 ]] && echo $line; done Which printed a lot.  Thank you guys!!
