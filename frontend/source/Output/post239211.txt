Minimum requirements for Mac Book Pro Core2Duo to boot <body> I got an older Macbook Pro as a present, without battery and harddisk. Memory is installed, LED power adapter is on. Since the machine doesn't boot, my question is if I have to install harddisk or battery to turn it on?  <comment293533> When you say it doesn't boot, what does it (not) do?  Please add some details like what you are seeing, what happens when you plug in the power adapter, etc.  Remember, we're not there to look over your shoulder. <comment293575> Ah, sorry. "Not boot" should have been "not turn on" I plug the powercord in, after a few seconds the little green LED is lit. Pressing the Powerbutton does not result in any visible or audible reaction.
