Is it possible to programmatically monitor the recently changed files on my OSX system? <body> I'd like to find and keep a list of the 1000 most recently changed files on my system.  I've looked a little bit at programs like fswatch that allow you to monitor a specific directory, but I'm not sure that these can be used across the whole file system. Is there a good way to do this performantly?
