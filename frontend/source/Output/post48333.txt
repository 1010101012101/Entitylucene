Lion Mail "Show Format Bar' button missing <body> In Lion Mail there is supposed to be a "show format bar" button at top right of a new mail window. It is not there for me. How can I get it to show?  <answer48339> You have to customise the toolbar and add the format button.  Drag the format button to the bar:br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/o13l3.png" alt="enter image description here"  And when you compose a new message, you can click on the format icon:br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xUYBs.png" alt="enter image description here"  And the bar will appear.  <comment56013> This is the correct answer. It would have even been better to say "you have to customize the toolbar using View  Customize Toolbar" because this was not immediately obvious. Nevertheless, thanks!
