What is the DeviceInfo folder in my home folder <body> Since a few days there is a DeviceInfo folder in my home folder. In it, there is a text file. What is this and where does it come from?  I can delete the folder, but it will reappear after a few days!  <comment258371> What's in the text file? <comment258389> a string with probably a device id <comment258401> In a Terminal I'd run the following command in an attempt to see if that text string is a Device ID, `system_profiler | grep '$string'`, replace "$string" with what's in the text file.  If it outputs something then investigate further with directing output of `system_profiler` to a text file where it can be searched from TextEdit to see the information around that string.  `system_profiler  filename.txt` <comment259675> it doesn't output anything <comment259683> you may need `system_profiler -detailLevel full` to see everything. <comment259727> Could you please explain, what I should do? <comment259884> What is the output of `lsof ~/DeviceInfo/text file`? If the command has no ouput, delete the folder and run `while :; do lsof +D ~/DeviceInfo 2/dev/null; sleep 1; done` until the folder is created and post the output (if any). <comment261072> there wasn't any output at all.
