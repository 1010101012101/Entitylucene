iPhone 6 - Phone call keypad not recognized <body> Recently, when I am on a call that requires pressing a number on the keypad (for instance: to select an option or join a WebEx), I can press the appropriate button and I see the press respond and hear the tone, but the other end of the line does not recognize that the number was pressed.  I thought it was only WebEx, but two other calls did the same thing today (one of them being an Apple support call).  strongHow can I fix/debug this?/strong  I tried searching Google for "iPhone 6 numeric keypad not working" but came up empty. strongIs there another term I should use in my search?/strong  <answer261835> As an update, I have not had this happen since upgrading my phone to iOS 10, so I can only assume that it was a bug with previous versions of the operating system.  Aside from that, I have not found a "solution".  <comment210429> The tone is not being "heard" on the other end of the line.  The only time I have this trouble is when the wireless signal is on one bar or less.  Improving your signal strength is the likely solution. <comment328800> Why the downvotes? After a year and a half, I don't have a "solution" except to upgrade and I thought that might be helpful to others. Should I provide more info (I'm not sure there is any)? SE recommends against deleting questions so I didn't want to do that. Let me know how to do better and I will.
