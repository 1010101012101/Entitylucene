16GB RAM filling up too easily on my 2015 15.4" MBP? <body> Anyone know why my Macbook Pro is easily filling up RAM and even using swap just for 10 Chrome tabs and maybe couple of basic apps idle in the background? It is currently under macOS Sierra.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/knWG0.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment341574> Please add some concise details - e.g does it use 64 MB or 4 GB of swap (example: [Mac OS X Yosemite using too much RAMâ€¦ Why?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/196752/mac-os-x-yosemite-using-too-much-ram-why)) <comment341575> It could be anywhere from 100 MB to 2 GB <comment341579> Can you please add at least a screenshot from Activity Monitor showing memory usage (the process list *and* the summary at the bottom)? Also, are you just wondering about memory usage or are you experiencing bad performance (if yes, measured how)? <comment341584> I added a screenshot. It seems normal, but to me, it just feels like its more RAM hungry than my previous MBP with 8GB RAM. Under similar workload, it would consume maybe 6GB of RAM whereas my 16GB MBP would probably consume 10GB of RAM. Do systems with more RAM take them more freely because it's available or..?
