How to use 3rd-party USB Ethernet adapter with El Capitan <body> I am plugging a USB Ethernet adapter (not Apple-brand) into my MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013). No go.  I do not see any relevant "USB Ethernet" item listed in codeSystem Preferences/code  codeNetwork/code. Should one appear when I plug in the adapter? Should I add an item with the "+" button?   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Gcnvv.png" alt="enter image description here"  When I use the "+" button, I only get a list of "Thunderbolt Bridge", "Thunderbolt 2", "Thunderbolt 1", "Bluetooth PAN", "Wi-Fi", "VPN", "PPPoE", and "6 to 4". I do not see any option for a USB-Ethernet adapter. Is this no longer supported by Apple?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Q1I3E.png" alt="enter image description here"  The codeApple menu &gt; About this Mac &gt; System Report (button) &gt; Hardware &gt; USB/code report shows that I have a product by Realtek Semiconductor Corp. (company web site)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8XjIq.jpg" alt="enter image description here"   <answer215002> If your adapter wasn't specifically advertised as Mac-compatible, then its unlikely to work. There are a couple of 3rd party brands that positively will work  but I wouldn't trust just any off brand adapter and if its a PC manufacturer brand, then it definitely won't have the internal circuitry that a Mac-compatible adapter will have so the answer, unfortunately is just... no.  See: [Do I have to use the Apple USB Ethernet Adapter for a MacBook Air? for further details on adapters that definitely are compatible.  <answer215003> You don't describe which adapter you might have bought, but if the OS does not provide a driver for it, you will have to install a driver from the manufacturer.  <answer230008> Old post, but just wanted to give an update.   Sometimes you just need to install the chipset's drivers.   h1Asix Driver/h1  If you are lucky, you will have an Asix's chipset and you can follow these steps to get it working. I did with an Acer's USB Adapter and it worked perfectly.  <answer242642> As far as I understand, you can run a lot of generic ones that don't have Apple-signed drivers by disabling "System Integrity Protection" (SIP)   From:  http://inkandfeet.com/how-to-use-a-generic-usb-20-10100m-ethernet-adaptor-rd9700-on-mac-os-1011-el-capitan     strongSteps to get your adapter working if you've never used the adapter before in Mac OS 10.11 El Capitan./strong      ol   liUninstall the dozens of other drivers you may have installed in the process of trying to get this working./li   liUnplug your USB adapter, and reboot and give yourself a clean slate./li   liReboot.

See original page for a discussion on the security risks of using this method.  But, if you need it to, and are aware of and OK with the risks, it works.  This worked for me on El Capitan (10.11) with a random off-brand adapter (can't remember the brand or if it even had one).  <answer243044> For a Cable Matters adapter, I had to get the drivers from here: http://www.asix.com.tw/download.php?sub=driverdetail&amp;PItemID=131  <answer248166> For Realtek based USB 2.0 or 3.0 Ethernet Adapters, you can get the driver from Realtek which works for both 8153 and 8152.  <comment305837> Can anybody help where to get the USBCDEthernet.kext ? I installed the quantum USB to Ethernet driver(IC is of Realtek) but it did not provide the .kext. From where do I get this .kext file? <comment332359> Just to comment that this worked for me with [this](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B009XPCNLW) adapter. You can re-enable SIP after installing the driver. <comment348724> This answer was pretty useful but RealTek - the makers if the 8152/8152B and 8153 Ethernet chips that are used by the majority of these generic USB connectors released an official, signed driver here: http://www.realtek.com.tw/Downloads/downloadsView.aspx?Langid=1&PNid=14&PFid=55&Level=5&Conn=4&DownTypeID=3&GetDown=false. Please use this because `csrutil disable` creates a security risk <comment348725> Thanks for this, this is the new correct answer. The previous answer by @[Aaron Wallentine] and @inkandfeet requires using `csrutil disable` which opens your system to malware. <comment348733> Nice @Eric, thanks for that.
