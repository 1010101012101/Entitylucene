How to find just deleted files in Time Machine? <body> I am going through many old photographs on my Mac, deleting duplicates that have occurred for one reason or another.  However, I realise that I may have deleted the wrong duplicate in some cases.  I have deleted several hundred duplicate photos, across multiple folders.  I have my whole hard drive backed up in Time Machine.  However I don't want to simply restore all the files in Time Machine for my photos folder since I have made some changes since doing the deletion that I want to keep.  There are too many files involved to hunt for them in Time Machine individually.  Is there a way I can identify the files in a folder in Time Machine that strongdo not/strong exist in the current filesystem?  And then a way to restore them.  I think the command line tool codetmutil/code may be helpful but I am not experienced with this.  <answer115493> Assuming you deleted the pictures directly in Finder  ul liopen (in Finder) the folder which used to contain the pictures/li liaccess Time Machine via the menulet/li liTM will open, showing the different time slices of your folde/li liGo back in time until before the deletion/li liRight-click on file(s) in question to restore them/li /ul  <answer202760> You can access time machine via a mount and then search and copy back to your machine using the automation technique of your choosing.

The basic functionality of Time Machine is not much help - I am looking for a more automated solution. <comment244603> Answers on Ask Different need to be more than just a link. It's okay to include a link, but please summarize or excerpt it in the answer. The idea is to make the answer stand alone. <comment244778> @patrix I added some more details from the link. Is that the type of details you were looking for? <comment244826> Thx.
