How can I download an application from the Mac App Store which is not compatible with my OS X version? <body> Is there any way to download app from the Mac App Store which requires a more current OS X version than I have running on my Mac? I know it will not run, but I need the actual file.  <comment205867> No, would be the answer, no matter what app it is. <comment205959> Ok, then do you know of a place where I can download `Install OS X Yosemite.app`? I just need the files. <comment205981> No, there is no official source to download it other than the Mac App Store.
