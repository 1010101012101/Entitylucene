Is there still iTunes plus upgrade for DRM'ed music? <body> Thanks to the tip here, I was able to make a smart playlist containing all the DRM encumbered music in my iTunes library.  I remember in the past there was an offer from iTunes Plus that lets you pay a fee to "upgrade" your DRM'ed songs to unprotected ones.  Does this still exist? How do I get non-DRM'ed versions of these songs nowadays?  Thanks!  BTW, I am running iTunes 10.5.1 on Mac OS X 10.6.8.  <answer31655> Open up iTunes. Go to the iTunes Store. Click on the iTunes Plus link at the bottom of the navigation window:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YzJee.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment36355> I tried it, but got a message saying I have already upgraded to iTunes plus, and no other options. However, I can obviously see DRM'ed songs in my library. What should I do???
