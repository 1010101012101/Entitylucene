There is only a short prehistory. But I think it isn't connected with this issue.  <answer194646> h2Bad News/h2  The Truecrypt Formula on Homebrew has been removed due to bugs, and probably uncertainty in the community regarding truecrypt's safety.  There also used to be a homebrew cask which was removed due to installation bugs.  However, it was also moved to homebrew-unofficial and scheduled for removal.  For more information about the 3rd party audit, and why Truecrypt is still safe to use, please see the links mentioned here.  h2Good News/h2  I have created a Homebrew Tap for Truecrypt 7.1a which fixes the installation problem, and works on OS X code10.10/code Yosemite!  h1Installation/h1  First, make sure you have installed codehomebrew-cask/code if you haven't yet:  precodebrew install caskroom/cask/brew-cask /code/pre  Then, run the following in your command-line:  precodebrew tap trinitronx/homebrew-truecrypt /code/pre  h1Usage/h1  strongNote/strong: For info run:  precodebrew cask info truecrypt /code/pre  Once the tap is installed, you can install codetruecrypt/code!  precodebrew cask install truecrypt /code/pre  <comment147747> `brew info truecrypt = Error: No available formula for truecrypt` <comment147749> That means what? I cannot follow you... <comment147752> It means that I can't reproduce the error and it seems that truecrypt is not on brew... (but I might made a mistake). Try to run `brew update` then `brew info truecrypt` <comment147756> Thats the [prehistory](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/126143/how-can-i-use-an-app-after-installing-it-via-brew-pull/126161#126161) <comment147809> Yes, I know, I'm the one who answer you. I told you to do that because `brew pull truecrypt` worked. It seems that truecrypt is no longueur on brew so I can't reproduce the error and that's might be the reason your installation is not working. <comment150288> Ok, I'm sorry. However, because I had a few problems more I chose the good old windows-way: Reinstall the OS and everything. It worked :) <comment150289> 19 days to re-install the OS :p anyway, can you tell us who did you install TrueCrypt this time ?
