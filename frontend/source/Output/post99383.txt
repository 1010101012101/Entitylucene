A little help writing a Homebrew formula for Apache Nutch? <body> I'm trying to automate the installation of Apache Nutch by writing a Homebrew formula. The official tutorial requires users to download a TAR.GZ / ZIP from a mirror, extract, cd, run codeant runtime/code, and finally, get the binaries into codePATH/code. That's a pain to do over and over, so I'm trying to write a Homebrew formula to automate this for fellow Mac users. The trouble is, my formula isn't working for some reason.  When I run codebrew install nutch --verbose/code, the build process appears to succeed, but the coderuntime//code directory is missing from the Cellar, resulting in a failed codebrew test nutch/code.  Could someone help me debug my nutch.rb install formula?  precoderequire 'formula'  class Nutch &lt; Formula   homepage 'http://nutch.apache.org/'   url 'http://mirror.reverse.net/pub/apache/nutch/2.2.1/apache-nutch-2.2.1-src.tar.gz'   sha1 'c5d5d535a87d518aad41e89047c1eeb4331b74d2'    def install     system "ant runtime"     prefix.install Dir['runtime/']     bin.install_symlink prefix/'runtime/local/bin/nutch'   end    test do     system "#{bin}/nutch", "parsechecker", "http://nutch.apache.org/"   end end /code/pre
