restoring to mavericks from yosemite, partition disappeared after fail <body> I have an mbpro 15" with 2 hard disks:  Main: SSD with OS Extra: Time machine backups and data  For different reasons I wanted to downgrade to Mavericks. I rebooted with cmd+r and went to time machine backups. Selected from the Extra HD and selected the Main to restore to. Insert Filevault PW, etc, next, etc. I clicked 'restore' and then it gave me an error:  "cannot restore" Without any specifics.  Rebooted and tried again but this time I didn't see my Main. I selected the time machine backup, because the Extra hard disk is there. But I couldn't choose Main as a restore point!  I checked with disk utility:  Both HD's are there. But it seems the partition dissapeared on my Main. I can't repartitions or format, the options aren't there.   Verify and repair disk didn't mention anything.  Who can help me restore to Mavericks? If not possible, restoring to yosemite is fine too, as long as I can use my Mac!

You may either recreate those or delete the Logical Volume Group wIth some corestorage commands. BTW how did you manage to get the output of the two mentioned cmds posted here so fast in recovery mode? <comment188736> You should try [DiskWarrior](http://www.alsoft.com/diskwarrior/), has saved my disks tons of times (you need an external OS to boot from though .) <comment188738> @klanomath i copy and pasted the terminal output to a usb drive. Unfortunately I don't understand what else you're saying :) But now I'm following this answer: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/152645/attempting-to-revert-to-mac-os-x-mavericks-now-cant-get-out-of-os-x-utilities?rq=1 <comment188739> @flowen I will write an extended answer soon. At the moment i'm afk and using an iPhone to comment. <comment188740> @listik Only DiskWarrior 5 (published a few days ago) can handle CoreStorage volumes. <comment188742> @klanomath I'm using the answer I'm posting and it's already restoring right now. Just waiting for it to finish and double check if everything is okay :) Don't want to waste your time until then! <comment188870> I basically did that using the answer from http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/152645/attempting-to-revert-to-mac-os-x-mavericks-now-cant-get-out-of-os-x-utilities?rq=1 but thanks for taking the time and it is EXACTLY what I did and what fixed the problem :) <comment188873> @flowen i just took my answer there and adapted it to your question (and the different conditions)
