locate isn't finding a file that exists <body> The file in question is:  code/Users/me/Library/Containers/com.dell.Toad/Data/workspace/.metadata/.plugins/com.dell.toadext.oracle.core/connections.xml/code  What is wrong with locate?   <answer239415> Nothing is wrong with locate. By default, it doesn't search for/in hidden files/directories.  The directories code/.metadata/code and  code/.plugins/code are both hidden by the fact they are prefixed with a period "." which means that locate is not going to index the files within those directories.  I prefer to use the codefind/code command:  codesudo find / -name connections.xml/code  <answer239424> You need to make sure the daemon is running on your machine:   precodesudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.locate.plist /code/pre  Alternatively you can also run the following command and build the database:  precodesudo /usr/libexec/locate.updatedb /code/pre  strongNote/strong, that indexing of files from the filesystem would take a while, so codelocate/code will not show you all the files matched immediately.   hr  Or you may use the regular codefind/code for search of what you need.  <answer239428> The codelocate/code database in built by the script code/usr/libexec/locate.updatedb/code. The script is run by the user codenobody/code in this line  precodetmpdb=`su -fm nobody -c "$0"` || rc=1 /code/pre  unless the user codenobody/code has access to a directory then the content of that directory is not recorded in the database. A simple solution would be to use codemdfind/code.  precodemdfind -name connections.xml /code/pre  <comment293797> Do you have the daemon `/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.locate.plist` enabled ? <comment293832> I tried mdfind connections.xml, it didn't return results. <comment293834> Thank you.  The find command works.  Is there a way to default enable locate to search in hidden directory and for hidden files?  I am used to linux and locate actually locating things. <comment293836> Thanks for the reply.  If the daemon isn't running ios will tell you to build the locatedb with those commands when you call locate.  I had already run them - I think the problem has to do with hidden directories. <comment293837> I would have to do further research because once I found that it *didn't* search for hidden files way back when without some editing of the .plist file, I abandoned it and went with `find` insead.  Besides, `find` is universal across OS X, FreeBSD, and Linux.
