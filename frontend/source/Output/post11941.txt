Using a dropdown menu with arrow keys in Photoshop <body> This may be a tad specific but it's one thing that irks me with OS X.  In Photoshop, if I want to change a layer style from 'Normal' to say 'Overlay', I need to click the dropdown list and select 'Overlay'. If I then wanted to change this again, I can't just use the keyboard buttons to scroll up or down the list - I need to go in using the mouse again and it's a bit of a pain.  Scrolling with the arrow keys works fine on other drop down lists like fonts etc.  Any ideas?  <answer12660> I am not sure if you can do this with the arrow keys but there are shortcut keys for navigating the layers box  h2Changing layer styles/h2     (with layer selected) hold down ⌥ + ⇧ (option &amp; shift) and use the + or - keys to cycle through the various layer dropdown     h2Navigation of layers/h2     UP  ⌥ + ]       DOWN ⌥ + [   h2Repositioning a selected layer/h2     (with layer selected) Move up a layer    with ⌘ + ]      (with layer selected) Move down a   layer with  ⌘ + [   these work for me with the CS5 version of photoshop  <comment12493> Hear, hear! Though this might be unanswerable and be because of how Photoshop is written. I've also noticed that navigating in the dialogs doesn't work as in other apps, even when [keyboard access: all controls](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/7263/how-can-i-select-buttons-with-just-the-keyboard/7269#7269) is selected in the OSX preferences. Arrow keys might work in font, opacity etc. drop-downs because they allow keyboard input.
