Enabling Things iPhone legacy sync messes up recurring tasks and areas - can this be avoided? <body> I'm trying to enable Bonjour Legacy Sync in Things iPhone (so that I can sync with an old and unused version of Things Mac on Snow Leopard).  Having followed the instructions linked above, when I restart Things in Things 1 mode it shows lots of instances of a recurring task in Today which weren't there before, and doesn't show a large number of changes I've recently made to Areas.  I've now turned off Things 1 mode and restored the Things 2 database. strongIs there a way to enable legacy sync without disordering my tasks and losing some recent changes?/strong  emRunning Things 2.2.3 on iOS 6.1.1 (deliberate non-upgrade to avoid battery problems on a beaten up 4S)./em  <answer116290> Prompt response via email from Julia at Cultured Code to my support request using the feedback form answers the question:     When you revert to Things 1 mode, the data from Things 2 cannot be   converted to the older database format. There should be a note warning   about this when converting to Things 1 mode; if not, I apologize for   the confusion this caused.      Basically, if you want to have the to-dos from Things 2 in Things 1,   you have to re-enter them manually. Since this downgrade path is one   that only very few customers chose to take, we didnâ€™t spend time on   implementing a downgrade path for the data.
