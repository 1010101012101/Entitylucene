Manually update carrier settings after dismissing prompt <body> My iPhone with iOS 10 recently popped up a dialogue prompting me to update my carrier settings and I accidentally pressed not now.  Is there a way to re-open that dialogue? A button that should be pressed somewhere? A page that needs to be opened in one of my apps? I have tried opening software update, Carrier settings, Phone settings, etc., but I just can't update my carrier settings.   <answer272981> Going to Settings  General  About should trigger a manual check for carrier settings updates.
