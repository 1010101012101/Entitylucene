Safari and Firefox displaying different colors than Chrome <body> On this website, the blue button has the defined color code#1E9AE2/code. In Safari and Firefox on macOS, this color is displayed as code#449AE0/code:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NdNcE.png" width="381"  In this screenshot, Safari is on the left, and Chrome to the right.  If I switch the following setting to "sRGB IEC61966-2.1", Safari and Firefox display it like the others too:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NVj0I.png" width="406"  What's the reason for this difference?  Do all macOS computers have this setting as a default?  <answer278952> The difference in color rendering is because of color profiles. Some browsers support color profiles, others don't. Embedding color profiles in your images will make their file sizes a bit larger, but will cause truer colors across browsers.

Instead it's probably defined in the css with: `background-color: #1E9AE2;` <comment351101> That second link explains it all (including CSS elements) under "Why tagging images for the web is not a complete answer?". In the end, it doesn't even matter. Everyone will have differently, and often ill-, configured displays.
