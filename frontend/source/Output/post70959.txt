Any stock means of inserting a period by pressing the spacebar twice? <body> I've grown to really appreciate the ability to press space twice on my iOS devices and have a period manually inserted without having to switch keyboards.  Though I realize the need isn't quite there on actual keyboards since the key is accessible at all times, I'm curious: strongIs there any way to get the same behavior using baked-in functionality on Mac OS X?/strong  This is assuming the most recent version of Mountain Lion is installed.  <answer70965> Try this:  ol liGo to strongSystem Preferences / Language &amp; Text / Text/strong/li liAdd a new rule where strong"  "/strong (double space) is replaced with strong". "/strong (period space)./li liMake sure you've got emSymbol and Text Substitution/em enabled, and this new emrule/em checked, too. /li /ol  It appears not to work emeverywhere/em, though.  <comment82412> Sweet, I'll check it out when I get home and accept this guy if it works out. Either way, thank you for the answer! <comment169147> This doesn't work in OS X 10.9.4. The original text cannot contain spaces: http://link.olivierlacan.com/image/0A1L3k1N2I1p. It's too bad, really.
