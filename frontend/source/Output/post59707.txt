What Is the Keyboard Shortcut for Sleep Display Without Eject Key? <body> I read that if you want to put your display into sleep the keyboard shortcut is kbdControl ⌃/kbd+kbdShift ⇧/kbd+kbdEject ⏏/kbd, but what is it in Mountain Lion or Lion using a retina MacBook Pro or MacBook Air without an eject button?  <answer59710> Found a solution over at the Apple Support Communities:     I just found out that pressing the function (fn) key and the power button calls up a dialog box where you can choose to sleep or shut down (shut down is the default when you press return.   Give it a shot!  <answer59711> Found two options:  ol liUse BetterTouchTool add global keyboard shortcut and choose Sleep Display./li liUse Hot Corners (System Preferences - Desktop &amp; Screen Saver) and choose Put Display To Sleep. (You can hold down kbdCommand ⌘/kbd and then it will only work when you're in the selected corner and while kbd⌘/kbd is pressed.)/li /ol  <answer59740> There's a short program on StackOverflow which uses a "semi-undocumented api" to put all displays to sleep.  Putting this in Automator should allow you to hook it to a global keyboard shortcut, I think.  <answer62275> (At least on the Retina display MacBook Pro) use the Power button the same as you previously used the Eject button. So kbdControl ⌃/kbd+kbdShift ⇧/kbd+kbdPower/kbd puts the display to sleep and kbdCommand ⌘/kbd+kbdOption ⌥/kbd+kbdPower/kbd puts the machine to sleep.  <answer73247> I finally found the solution to get the same functionality as the previous model (The model with the kbdEject ⏏/kbd button).  The same thing can be achieved by replacing the kbdEject ⏏/kbd button with kbdFn/kbd + kbdPower/kbd button.  kbdControl ^/kbd + kbdShift ⇧/kbd + kbdFn/kbd + kbdPower/kbd: Turns off your screen  kbdCommand ⌘/kbd + kbdOption ⌥/kbd + kbdFn/kbd + kbdPower/kbd: Put Macbook to Sleep  All other solutions involved a third party software, a new shortcut or did not work.

Call me crazy, but I *think* that's one option.  ;) <comment68737> This only allows the user to sleep the computer, not the display.  Also, on a sidenote, it doesn't matter whether you press fn or not – the power button does the same thing.  At least, that's true for me on 10.8. <comment68738> That one I'm not entirely sure on. The post over there comes to an abrupt end after the solution is posted. <comment68739> Ah, there you go. <comment68743> The combination 'control-eject' is a shortcut for 'power'.  (ADB keyboards had a real power button, but virtually none of Apple's USB/BT keyboards do.)  So 'control-shift-eject' seems like it should be the same as 'shift-power'.  Does that combo work for you? <comment71963> At any rate, this is the best answer. <comment71964> Is there anything in this question that isn't covered here: [Is there a similarly fast alternative to Crtl + Shift + Eject for new Macbook Air?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/18365/) Also relevant are [What's the purpose of the eject button on the MacBook Air?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/5736/) and [Put the display to sleep without putting the whole computer to sleep?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/27279/) <comment71965> @CajunLuke I agree, but my money is on this [other question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/5736/) being the best question. <comment71966> @bmike It's probably a duplicate of the first one, but the second one is misleading for owners on 2011 or 2012 Airs and this question is only covered in an answer in the third. <comment76888> +1 nice use of __key tags__ by new user. Welcome! <comment104512> WOW. I didn't know that a 'Put display to Sleep' even existed. I think Command ⌘ + Hot Corner is the way to go. The Mac is so AWESOME. :D <comment106170> This does not answer the question which is about how to put the display to sleep **without** the eject key (not present on devices without an optical drive) <comment106698> @Ken Shift+Power combo doesn't work. <comment141755> and this will put the display to sleep? <comment142592> Strangely, this seems to deactivate my USB network adapter at the same time. <comment185379> Since Mavericks (10.9), just the Power button sleeps the display (does not put the computer to sleep). <comment185380> Since Mavericks, just the Power button sleeps the display (without putting the computer to sleep).
