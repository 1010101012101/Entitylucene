vim does not accept syntax in vimrc <body> When I put the following in ~/.vimrc and save it,       syntax on   vim get errors while opening. I think there are some vim configuration conflicts. Herewith the errors:     Error detected while processing /Users/Home/.vimrc: line    1: E484:   Can't open file /usr/share/vim/syntax/syntax.vim   I'd appreciate if you can help to get rid of this problem. I'm running osx snow loepard 6.8  <answer91664> A quick and dirty fix is to create the missing file with contents:  precode" Vim syntax support file " Maintainer:   Bram Moolenaar &lt;Bram@vim.org&gt; " Last Change:  2001 Sep 04  " This file is used for ":syntax on". " It installs the autocommands and starts highlighting for all buffers.  if !has("syntax")   finish endif  " If Syntax highlighting appears to be on already, turn it off first, so that " any leftovers are cleared. if exists("syntax_on") || exists("syntax_manual")   so &lt;sfile&gt;:p:h/nosyntax.vim endif  " Load the Syntax autocommands and set the default methods for highlighting. runtime syntax/synload.vim  " Load the FileType autocommands if not done yet. if exists("did_load_filetypes")   let s:did_ft = 1 else   filetype on   let s:did_ft = 0 endif  " Set up the connection between FileType and Syntax autocommands. " This makes the syntax automatically set when the file type is detected. augroup syntaxset   au! FileType *    exe "set syntax=" . expand("&lt;amatch&gt;") augroup END   " Execute the syntax autocommands for the each buffer. " If the filetype wasn't detected yet, do that now. " Always do the syntaxset autocommands, for buffers where the 'filetype' " already was set manually (e.g., help buffers). doautoall syntaxset FileType if !s:did_ft   doautoall filetypedetect BufRead endif /code/pre  which is valid (at the very least) for codevim/code 7.0 through 7.3, as the file hasn't changed in years.  If you take a closer look, though, it is quite surprising that codevim/code tries to open code/usr/share/vim/syntax/syntax.vim/code: I checked the path of codesyntax.vim/code on different OS X versions and this is what I got:  ul liOS X 10.8.3 "Mountain Lion"   precode/usr/share/vim/vim73/syntax/syntax.vim /code/pre/li liMac OS X 10.5.8 "Leopard"  precode/usr/share/vim/vim70/syntax/syntax.vim /usr/share/vim/vim72/syntax/syntax.vim /code/pre/li /ul  I'd expect Mac OS X "Snow Leopard" to follow a similar pattern, so why is the path different? What has changed in codevim/code, have you compiled a newer version or replaced it?  It could also be that code/usr/share/vim/vim&lt;version&gt;/syntax/syntax.vim/code exists, in which case, as an alternative, you could create a link:  precodesudo mkdir -p /usr/share/vim/syntax/ sudo ln /usr/share/vim/vim&lt;version&gt;/syntax/syntax.vim /usr/share/vim/syntax/syntax.vim /code/pre  <comment107561> If you start `vim`, type `:syntax on` and then Enter, does it work? <comment107588> It says "No Syntax items defined for this buffer" <comment107706> How did you install vim? Are you using the version installed by default with OS X? <comment107862> Sorry for the late reply jaume, I had no access to my Mac. I don't remember how I've installed it. in /usr/share/vim, there is this file only: vimrc.save <comment107897> Thanks for your feedback, why don't you create `/usr/share/vim/syntax/syntax.vim` with contents as shown above and see if that solves your issue?
