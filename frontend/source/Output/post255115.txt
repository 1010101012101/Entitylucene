macOS Sierra How do disable Siri prompt? <body> After upgrading my wife's iMac to macOS Sierra 10.12.0, she chose to disable Siri from the System Preferences for her own reasons. Now, every time we press the play/pause button on one of the older white infrared Apple remotes, the following dialog appears:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vOVCC.png" alt="&quot;Do you want to enable Siri?&quot; dialog window in macOS Sierra."  Is there a way to prevent this from displaying, even if it means somehow nuking Siri altogether?
