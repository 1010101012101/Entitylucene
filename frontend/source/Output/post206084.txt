Stereo audio for screen recorder <body> I tried quicktime and monosnap to make a video tutorials, but both produce a mono audio. What should I do to make it stereo?   emnb: I'm using Steinberg CI2+ soundcard + ISK mic./em  <answer206090> You may need to record the audio separately, then merge it with the screen capture. If nothing else, you can accomplish that in iMovie.  <answer206411> I'm sorry, I've figured out this problem. Actually, in my soundcard there is a Mono button and when I activated it, it convert the Mono audio to Stereo. :)  <comment248485> You mean it is recording only one side of the stereo field, or it's summing a true stereo source to mono? I'm assuming you have a mono mic anyway, so what tells you it's recording in mono, & what are you expecting a stereo recording of a mono mic to sound like? <comment256710> Can you mark this as the correct answer? <comment256860> Ups, sorry I forgot to marked it.
