How to set a Calendar alert for AFTER completion of an event? <body> I would like to set calendar alerts to happen at the scheduled completion time of my events - whatever that may be.  I can't seem to figure out a way to do this.  You can create alarms that go off before an event starts, at the start time, or a fixed number of minutes after start time.  But is there a way to set an alarm that triggers AT OR AFTER the completion time of an event, without having to specify the exact date &amp; time?  <answer178013> Just enter an alert at a customized time (which is equal to end of the event).  This works for iCal 5 (Mac OS X 10.7):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eqwI0.jpg" alt="iCal 5"   and also for iCal 7 (Mac OS X 10.9). It looks a bit different though:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hhMer.png" alt="iCal 7"  <answer178971> Well there doesn't appear to be any actual proper solution to this, so I have resorted to simply putting an alert in at the pre-set duration of the event.  Definitely not what I was hoping for but... it's the best that I could come up with.  This gets me an alert at the end of the time block, but unfortunately won't automatically adjust if I alter the duration of a block.  <comment210738> J van Clote, that is indeed unusual event alarm. Did you try something in the Automator ? <comment210739> Haven't tried anything special, just trying to set this in Calendar natively.  Really don't want to have to jump through any hoops or do anything more complex for something this basic.  I just want certain alerts to notify me when a scheduled block of time is up. <comment210771> My request was specific to not having to input the exact time & date. <comment210772> @JonathanvanClute Oh sorry, i misread that
