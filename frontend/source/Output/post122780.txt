Writing to an NTFS volume is disabled on 10.9.2? <body> Hi I recently upgraded to 10.9.2 and I cannot write to NTFS anymore - in fact I cannot mount NTFS anymore unless I removed the the lines that allow me to write NTFS in the past in /etc/fstab...  I also tried NTFS-3G and it's the same result - the system won't mount my NTFS drive unless I reverse to the default system files or settings (which only allow me to read NTFS, without enabling the write feature).  Did Apple disable NTFS write? Why?  Also I tried Tuxera NTFS and it gives me this error message: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Em2n8.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer122974> In my experience, using paragon NTFS drivers works perfectly.  <answer122999> no paragon NTFS doesn't work either. The solution I had was:  In the terminal:  precodebrew remove osxfuse brew remove fuse4x brew remove NTFS-3G /code/pre  ul liThen remove everything in code/etc/fstab/code/li liRestart the computer/li liInstall Tuxera/li liPlug in the hard-drive, get an error message/li liEject the hard-drive/li liRestart the computer/li liPlug in the hard-drive, now it works!/li /ul  I think 10.9.2 installs some additional files that removed the support for NTFS-3G. For now I am happy with using Tuxera - and if anyone finds out how to use NTFS-3G, please share!  <answer124806> I found a description on how to use NTFS-3G. According to this source updated March 2014, the package ntfs-3g is updated and you have to sym link the mount_ntfs file to a new destination, so if you have set up before and have updated your brew you may need to unlink a few dependencies and definitely link to the new destination mount_ntfs destination. Also on completion when a ntfs disk is mounted a new error is displayed but the disk still mounts and is read/writable.  http://coolestguidesontheplanet.com/how-to-write-to-a-ntfs-drive-from-os-x-mavericks/  I personally updated to 10.9.2 without problems with my NTFS drives. The only problem copying onto an NTFS Drive takes very long. I have installed in my system preferences  OSXFUSE 2.6.2 and NTFS-3G 2010.10.2  Yogi   <answer128758> I updated my guide - turns out the issue is that osxfuse is just needed with ntfs-3g - fuse4x has to be removed.  http://coolestguidesontheplanet.com/how-to-write-to-a-ntfs-drive-from-os-x-mavericks/  <comment143356> Did you try with paragon NTFS ? <comment143579> no paragon NTFS doesn't work <comment143580> Yes I have tried paragon NTFS. <comment143592> But you can't sudo brew... <comment143690> Sorry, I wrote this with my memory. You don't need sudo before the brew. Instead, if you have installed fuse4x you need to remove the files - so the command is sudo rf "location." <comment155415> This doesn't work for me "sudo: brew: command not found" in fact i have tried all the solution on the net and nothing worked. Help please! <comment163770> You might have to install brew. What version is your OS X system? <comment177034> This free solution worked for me. You need homebrew installed though. http://coolestguidesontheplanet.com/how-to-write-to-a-ntfs-drive-from-os-x-mavericks/
