Import Keynote Animation to iMovie <body> I have a Keynote file with a lot of animations on the slides. I wish to record myself giving a presentation while playing the slides in full screen as a movie.   Is there a way to export Keynote animations to a video format so that I can combine my audio recording with these animations in iMovie?  <answer229101> Found the answer:  ol liGo to codePlay/code - codeRecord Slideshow/code./li liGo to codeFile/code - codeExport To/code - codeQuickTime/code - codeSlideshow Recording/code./li /ol
