Unable to use Siri to ask questions not dictate on standard keyboard <body> When I hold down the home button I can usually ask Siri a question and she will reply with an answer to web results. Now, it's as if the microphone is not working and after a few seconds my voice doesn't register and gives me suggestions on what to ask Siri.  I tested using microphone using voice memo and that works fine.  There are no obstructions on the microphone area.  I tried:  ol liTurning off Bluetooth/li liTrying with wifi and LTE/li liTurn Siri off, power off, and turn Siri back on/li liTried turning on dictation and dictation off/li liresetting all settings using reset option/li /ol  I also noticed I can't dictate on the standard English keyboard  Any thoughts? I have iPhone 6 with iOS 9.3.2  <comment294844> If you turn hey Siri off and then on does it let you train it with your voice? <comment294845> And have you tried a different Internet connection? <comment294846> Front facing mic next to front camera is defective. Didn't know apple has two microphones <comment294848> So I guess you can use Siri with the EarPods's microphone till you get your phone replaced or fixed. Maybe WWDC will have something for you in a couple weeks.
