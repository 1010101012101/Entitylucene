Can I use my F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys only for specific apps? <body> I constantly use the brightness, mission control, volume, and iTunes playback shortcuts on my keyboard's function row. However, a handful of apps I use make heavy use of F1, F2, etc. for keyboard shortcuts, and it's annoying having to use something like kbdFn/kbd+kbdF7/kbd all the time for something that was intended to be a single keystroke away.  I can think of a few ways to get around this problem:  ol liManually reassign any and all keyboard shortcuts that make use of function keys to something else. Ugh./li liEnable the "Use all F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys" option in System Preferences, and re-train myself to use kbdFn/kbd whenever I want to use the system shortcuts. Ugh.br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/62IOn.jpg" alt="Screenshot"/li listrongFind a way to enable this option only for certain applications./strong/li /ol  Is this possible to do? Are there any third-party apps that can take care of this for me?  <answer49340> I've seen this application before when I was just browsing, never used it though. It's called FunctionFlip.     strongFunctionFlip/strong individually controls your MacBook or MacBook Pro's function keys, turning special keys back to regular F-keys, or vice-versa. FunctionFlip is a preference pane; you'll find it in the "Other" category in System Preferences.   <answer72280> Try Palua, I think this is exactly what you're looking for. Costs $0.99 / Â£0.69 in the Mac App Store.   In MacStories: Control OS X Function Keys with Palua  <comment56484> This sort of does what I want, except it works system-wide. I need something that does what FunctionFlip does but only for specific apps. <comment100201> Note - we have a [similar but distinct question on how to make system-wide changes to the keys](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/18527/can-i-over-ride-some-but-not-all-apple-keyboard-function-keys) to mix some as Apple defined and some defaulting to F6 (or whatever number desired). This question seems more about making one (or some Apps) have a different map as opposed to making a system wide change. <comment314076> This app no longer exists.
