Why does Mac OS X turn off monitor #2 when an application is maximized on monitor #1? <body> I am running OS X Yosemite 10.10.5 on a Mac Mini system with two monitors. When I maximize an application on monitor 'A', monitor 'B' then goes black while that application maximizes to fill 'A'.  Why the heck is this happening? How do I fix it?  Thanks!  <answer207410> Why?br Personally,. because I don't think they ever thought it through properly. There's a lot about fullscreen that's like that.   The fix is possibly System Prefs  Mission Control  check Displays have separate Spaces  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uwPtc.png" alt="enter image description here"  The better fix is don't use fullscreen, use Alt/click on the green button to maximise instead.  <comment250144> Thank you! This may sound silly, but you have made my night. Now my code development may exist peacefully now, with Firefox open... ;)!!!!! <comment250146> Nothing silly about having a comfortable workflow :-) I'm a big Spaces user myself - but fullscreen really messes Spaces up. See http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/179376/what-is-an-efficient-way-for-developers-power-users-to-use-osx-window-manageme/179403#179403 for some of my other ramblings on the subject ;) <comment250175> I believe OS X El Capitan will be changing some of this. <comment250176> I hope so, but I'm going to wait for the .1 release to see if it fixes some other things I found even more irritating in the GM ;)
