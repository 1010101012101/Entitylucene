MySQL Preference Pane is specifying a port number when it runs mysqld <body> As it says above. When I run mysqld using the preference pane for MySql, one of the arguments it is providing is --port=3307.  Does anyone know how I might go about changing this?  Operating System is OSX 10.10.4br MySQL version is 5.6.26  <answer199916> You may change the port in the file com.oracle.oss.mysql.mysqld.plist file in /Library/LaunchDaemons by editing it with   precodesudo nano /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.oracle.oss.mysql.mysqld.plist /code/pre  Change the port at  precode  &lt;string&gt;--port=3307&lt;/string&gt; /code/pre  near the end of the file to whatever you need it to be and reboot your Mac or restart the service.  <comment240788> Please add your current operating system and the MySQL version. <comment244100> I tried that on OSX 10.10.5, and only see binary data in Nano. Running `file /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.oracle.oss.mysql.mysqld.plist` gives me `Apple binary property list`. Am I doing something wrong or has this changed somehow very recently? <comment244101> @MJV Please change the plist format with `plutil -convert xml1 some_file.plist`. You may have to prepend "sudo" <comment244108> Thank you! I learned something new again. (Probably should have googled that myself, though.) Went with JSON but that's a personal preference.
