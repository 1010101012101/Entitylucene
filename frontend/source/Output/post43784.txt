How can I play YouTube in the background without using Safari? <body> Is there an easy way to keep playing YouTube videos in the background, even if I switch to a different app?  I'm not interested in using the Safari multitasking trick.

YouTube audio will resume playback./li /ul  <comment49780> Exact duplicate of http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/12005/how-do-i-play-a-youtube-video-in-the-background-on-my-ipad <comment49791> @Gerry Not realky: Ive specified I need an app, and not using Safari.
