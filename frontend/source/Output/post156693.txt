You could also use a cable to hook up your TV, or stream it from an iDevice. You could also put in on a supported video stream site (like YouTube), and play it from the Apple TV's app. There are more ways then I'm able to list in the answer, so explore!  <answer159364> But I don't think itunes support avi file since all Apple device only accepts .mp4, .mov and .m4v videos. You'd better convert avi to mp4 or other Apple supported video format before straming via AirPlay.  <comment184248> Thanks, I would like to stream the video _wireless_ to my AppleTV connected to a TV with an HDMI cable <comment184271> Thank you.
