How to remove rEFInd from macOS Sierra when a different partition was not made to install it. <body> I have a macbook pro(2017) with macOS Sierra(version 10.12.6). I was trying to install kali by following the documentation: https://docs.kali.org/installation/kali-linux-dual-boot-on-mac-hardware. While installing rEFInd, it gave me an error so I followed the following link to install it: https://www.deranged-society.com/en/hard-and-software/how-to-install-refind-0-10-4-on-mac-os-sierra/. I successfully installed refind and also created a bootable pen drive for Kali but I got the rEFInd not working on macOs Sierra: “Not found while loading legacy loader” error: https://superuser.com/questions/1127506/refind-not-working-on-macos-sierra-not-found-while-loading-legacy-loader. I found another way to do it: Installing dual boot Sierra and Kali-Linux but I dont know how to remove the rEFInd bootloader(and cannot by pass it because I did not create another partition while installing it) from Sierra. I am a novice and have just shifted from windows to mac, what should I do next?
