Why does Office for Mac need Safari and Chrome closed for installation? <body> In an update for MS Office for Mac, the installer asks to close Chrome and Safari â€” why?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zQIfz.png" alt="enter image description here"  What do those programs have to do with Microsoft Office?  br  I only have Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.  <answer94000> Presumably, the Office installer can modify/update the Microsoft codeSilverlight.plugin/code (which is installed in code/Library/Internet Plug-Ins//code), which Safari and Chrome could potentially be using.  It's primarily just a precaution against updating files which an application is actively using.  [EDIT]  After further investigation, it looks like it's actually the fact that the installer modifies the fonts in code/Library/Fonts/Microsoft//code which is the motivation behind requiring that several apps not be running. The following is an excerpt from the XML codeDistribution/code script that's in the code16807Office 2011 14.3.5 Update.pkg/code installer package:  precode&lt;choice id="fonts" selected="true" start_enabled="false" start_selected="false" start_visible="false" title="fonts-title"&gt;     &lt;pkg-ref id="fonts"&gt;         &lt;must-close&gt;             &lt;app id="com.apple.Safari"/&gt;             &lt;app id="org.mozilla.firefox"/&gt;             &lt;app id="com.google.Chrome"/&gt;             &lt;app id="com.operasoftware.Opera"/&gt;             &lt;app id="com.microsoft.Word"/&gt;             &lt;app id="com.microsoft.Excel"/&gt;             &lt;app id="com.microsoft.Query"/&gt;             &lt;app id="com.microsoft.Powerpoint"/&gt;             &lt;app id="com.microsoft.Outlook"/&gt;         &lt;/must-close&gt;     &lt;/pkg-ref&gt; &lt;/choice&gt; /code/pre  [EDIT]  Another pair of potential culprits are   precodeSharePointBrowserPlugin.plugin and SharePointWebKitPlugin.webplugin  /code/pre  They are installed by default with Office 2011 under code/Library/Internet Plug-Ins/code. (Note: Silverlight was not an option to install with 2011).  <answer182178> None of the above!!! just force quit Google and that's it!!   <comment110196> Interesting thought, but I see the same issue, and I don't have Silverlight installed <comment110569> I had always assumed it was Silverlight, which (IIRC) is an option that you can install. I always just assumed the installer was too lazy to check whether Silverlight was actually being installed. <comment110582> +1. It's incredibly annoying. <comment110586> Office does indeed add fonts - curiously, in a folder within your /Library/Fonts folder. Remove or keep at will. <comment110842> @Reid What would happen if you went ahead with the install & didn't close the browsers ? <comment110851> @Simon, there isn't a choice to continue the installation without closing the browsers. <comment110852> @thekirbylover Ah ok fine (unlike in Windows) <comment157655> Fonts make sense for first time install, but not for service packs. How often are the security fixes patching files in the fonts folder? This is just annoying. <comment159395> Also the /Library/Internet Plug-ins/OfficeLiveBrowserPlugin.plugin.  Have now deleted all three. <comment216818> How do you force quit Google? And how does this solve the problem described in the question?
