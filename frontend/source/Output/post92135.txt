How can I copy MP3s from PC to iPhone (which isn't currently synced with the PC)? <body> I have an iPhone 4 (with iOS 6.x on it) that is not synced with any computer.  How can I copy MP3s from a PC to my iPhone? iTunes is not synced with the phone so I cannot put the MP3s into the library and sync.   <answer92184> The default media player app needs to sync with itunes.  You could use a file manager like Documents (free), transfer the mp3 files to your phone and listen to them (in the Documents app).
