iBooks performance <body> I have noticed issues with iBooks lagging noticeably. While scrolling pages or browsing the store, I get little jerks, and mini-freezes. Seems like a CPU/processing power issue. But no other apps are suffering, only iBooks.  I have already killed other apps and rebooted the phone.  What is causing this? Anyone else have this issue? How can I fix it?  Interestingly, scrolling the bookshelf and the spinning bookcase animation when switching between library and store do emnot/em seem to lag at all. It's only in books, and while browsing/buying in the store.  Example if comparison to another app: in the App Store, press Buy and it smoothly morphs into the green button that actually buys. In iBooks, it jerks and lags, the green button appears partially, and takes several seconds to fully appear.  <comment87730> Does it happen in all books or only in specific ones? <comment87814> More so in books with lots of pictures, but most definitely happens in text-only books too. Also happens in the store, with no books open.
