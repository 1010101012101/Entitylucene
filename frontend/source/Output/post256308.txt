Word for Mac 2011 Space Issues <body> I have failed to find any solution to this ongoing problem that works.  Problem: The last page of every chapter of my document has a space at the top that I cannot delete. Each chapter is ended with a page break. If I key in a series of hard returns BEFORE the break they actually force the text up the page until it fills that space BUT I have been warned not to use hard returns this way as they can disrupt the book's overall formatting when finally printed.  Any ideas as to why the space to begin with and how to fix it?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6fL32.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment319644> Are you centering your page?  It looks that way and the only time I have seen something like this is when the page was centered vertically. <comment319850> G'day Allan, I'm not aware that I'm centering the page, although I did notice that is what it looks like. If that IS the case that's happening with the last page of each chapter then it must be happening with all the other pages. How do I fix that? <comment319856> You're brilliant, Allan. Your comment re centering put me on the right track and I have now solved my problem. Thanks heaps, mate!! <comment319866> Glad you found it.  I was just looking for a copy of Office 2011 to try and get you the answer.  Do me a favor and write it up as an answer and i will upvote you.  This way we can close out the question.
