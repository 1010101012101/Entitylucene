Is there an iOS PDF reader with support for PDF layers? <body> I was looking for a PDF Reader application which supported PDF layers (turning them on and off).  Do any exist?  <answer8351> I think the DocuWorks viewer will, but does not seem to be available in the U.S. store right now for some reason.   <comment8974> Who makes it? Can you provide a URL to a website for the product? (The iTunes link doesn't work for me) <comment8978> http://www.fxap.com.sg/product/productDescription.jsp?id=167
