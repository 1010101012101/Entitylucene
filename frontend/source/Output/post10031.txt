Weird keybindings in Mac OS X Terminal.app <body> I am trying to use the key "shift-tab" in emacs running purely under Terminal.app, but got an error saying there is no keybinding for "M-[ z" (where M is the meta key, set to be the option key under Terminal.app preferences). In other words, emacs thinks I am pressing "option-[ z" when I pressed "shift-tab" on the keyboard of my MacBook Pro running Mac OS X 10.6.6, what is the problem and how do I correct it? Thank you.  <answer10034> Terminal.app is actually doing what it's supposed to:  codeshift-TAB/code sends codeESC [ z/code which Emacs reads as codeM-[ z/code.  The problem is that the terminal description for codexterm-color/code (the one usually used with Terminal.app and other terminal emulators) is missing the codekcbt/code declaration, so Emacs doesn't know that that's what the key sends.  There are two ways to fix this:  ol liEdit the terminal description:  precode$ infocmp &gt;xterm-color.ti $ printf '\tkcbt=\E[Z,\n' &gt;&gt;xterm-color.ti $ sudo tic xterm-color.ti /code/pre/li liTell Emacs about it directly:  precode$ echo "(global-set-key "\M-[Z" 'something)" &gt;&gt;~/.emacs /code/pre/li /ol  The problem in both cases is that there doesn't seem to be a codebackwards-tab/code command to substitute for codesomething/code.  Emacs.app binds backtab to codeyank/code; what do you want it to do?  <answer20636> As of Mac OS X Lion 10.7, Terminal is more compatible with modern xterm† and therefore the default $TERM value is now xterm-256color, which contains the kcbt entry, eliminating any need to edit the terminfo entry. xterm-color describes an older branch of xterm and is missing a number of things supported by modern xterm.  † Highlights include: Terminal now uses the BCE (Background Color Erase) color model, it supports 256 colors, and the latest xterm-compatible escape sequences for switching to/from the alternate screen buffer.  <comment10473> I am trying to use "shift-TAB" to cycle through all headings expanded vs closed in emacs org-mode. <comment10475> Ok, I don't normally use that, but it has a `backtab` binding so you should use the first option (fixing the terminal description to define `backtab`). <comment10476> If someone is only concerned with “fixing” their one account, then the `sudo` can be omitted to re-compile into `~/.terminfo/`. This will also prevent it from being overwritten by a system update.
