iBooks in iOS 10 not working <body> Since updating my iPad  to version 10.01 my iBooks app simply crashes. Strangely no one else except me seems to complain.   Am I here all alone?  <comment314648> I have iOS 10 and I'm able to open iBooks without a problem.  Is it specific items you're trying to open or is it just opening iBooks causes the crash?  Have you tried deleting and reinstalling iBooks?
