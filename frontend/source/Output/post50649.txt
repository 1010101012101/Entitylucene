How to make bash (Terminal.app) remember history of previous sessions? <body> In my computer at work, my bash shell remembers history from previous sessions, even if I just opened a new terminal.br In my computer at home, this doesn't happen.br I have the same OS 10.6.8 in both machines and I don't have any history related setting in code.bash_profile/code.br How could I set this up on my home computer so it remembers history across sessions?  <answer50651> You'll need to tell bash where to keep your history file, and how many lines to keep:  precode# Set the location of your HISTFILE echo "export HISTFILE=/Users/&lt;USERNAME&gt;/.bash_history" &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile  # Number of lines to keep (1000 in this example) echo "export HISTFILESIZE=1000" &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile  # Set how many commands to keep in the current session history list echo "export HISTSIZE=80" &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile  # Ignore commands that start with a space echo "export HISTIGNORE=\"&amp;:[ ]*:exit\"" &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile /code/pre  <answer118764> I just discovered I had a similar problem, though my employer only has two Macs, and neither sits on emmy/em desk. Unacceptable, but a battle for another time.  Anyway, at home, Mac Mini (migrated from MacBook Pro) did not cooperate even after setting code.bashrc/code and/or code.profile/code. Then I discovered that my code~/.bash_history/code file was mysteriously owned by root. Had to do this:  precodesudo -iu root cd ~(myusername) chown (myusername) .bash_history /code/pre  (Yes, I know it can be done in fewer commands. Habit.)  Then I exited Terminal, and started up a new one. Woot! All sorts of history previously lost came rushing back. How very nice.  Likelihood anyone reading this has accidentally put themselves in this predicament: 0.2%. I'm sure I mucked this up when over-zealously "fixing" something else.  <answer161537> I had a similar problem as well, no history recorded. The given solutions didn't work, but at long last I found out that the problem was as simple as a missing .bash_history  The solution was to go to code/home/[username]//code and add a file code.bash_history/code, so  precodenano .bash_history /code/pre  and then type anything in the file (otherwise it won't be created), exit and save. After this the history started functioning normally.  <answer235023> I had this problem and what worked for me was create a file called code.bash_sessions_disable/code in my user folder (code~//code).  Basically OS X create history files in code.bash_sessions/code folder for each session (in my case, one for each Tab). And even properly closing these sessions, OS X don't replay the historical to code.bash_history/code.  Creating the code.bash_sessions_disable/code you disable this behavior.  precodetouch ~/.bash_sessions_disable /code/pre  <answer240256> This answer from this Reddit thread saved me:     It's probably RVM preventing the exit "hook" for bash_sessions to run. If you comment out the following line in your .bash_profile, it should work.   precode[[ -s "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" ]] &amp;&amp; source "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" /code/pre  <comment58044> Also asked at http://superuser.com/q/421544/4714 <comment58119> That should all be unnecessary by default. The default bash configuration (at least on Mac OS X) enables command history. <comment58130> Key word, /should/. If his isn't recording history, this will force bash to keep the history on init. <comment268241> Not merely *should*, but *will* unless something has been done to suppress the default history behavior, in which case, just slamming some values into these variables is merely papering over the actual problem. If this answer resolves the issue, then something else is really messed up and should be fixed to avoid other issues. <comment268242> If this resolves the issue, then something else is wrong and should be fixed to avoid other issues. If you start up Bash when there is no history file, it will create one. If it doesn’t try to create one, or it is unable to create it, there’s something wrong with some shell startup script or the home directory permissions.
