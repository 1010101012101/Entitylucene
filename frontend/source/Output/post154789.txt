calling open from terminal with smb file path and preview as application opens finder instead of preview <body> I am trying to open a file on an smb share in preview from terminal. The following command opens the containing folder in finder instead of the file in preview.   codeopen -a /Applications/Preview.app "smb://myshare._smb._tcp.local/path/to/file/my_file.pdf"/code  Update 1: I tried with and without the -a switch. The same thing happens in both cases: finder is opened with the last folder (/path/to/file). Preview is already associated with PDFs, so it should open automatically.   <answer154807> Just use code/Applications/Preview.app/Contents/MacOS/Preview /path/to/file.pdf/code instead of code/Applications/Preview.app /path/to/file.pdf/code and it should work.  <answer154876> 1.) Your situation is not related to the codeopen/code command. Before one can pass a remote share filepath as part of an argument, the share must first be established at a mount point. Here's an illustration to show what happens--or emdoesn't/em happen--using the simplest of commands:  codels smb://myshare._smb._tcp.local/path/to/file/my_file.pdf/code  Indeed, referencing a file in the manner you described--invoking its path via a mount request--causes that path to embecome/em a mount point. The Finder window you mentioned seeing:      ... finder is opened with the last folder (/path/to/file) ...   represents the last known directory the system could use to create a mountable share. Run the command as you did, and look in /Volumes to see what I mean. It's likely not the share name you're used to seeing on that machine.  2.) When using codeopen/code as a command to launch an applications which is present in /Applications (or in ~/Applications), it's not necessary to provide its full path or its extension. Although the man pages would seem to indicate otherwise from their presentation, the command codeopen -a Preview/code is equivalent to codeopen -a /Applications/Preview.app/code  3.) For that matter, if launch services associates a particular filetype with a default application--as with .pdfs and other image files with Preview, for example--it is not necessary to include the application name in the argument. The command codeopen /path/to/my_file.pdf/code is equivalent to codeopen -a Preview /path/to/my_file.pdf/code  4.) I'm not all that clever when it comes to UNIX, so my following attempt at a solution will no doubt soon be improved by someone who has the skills I lack.  I'll start with the simplest way I know to mount a remote filesystem (it doesn't require creating a /dev node as with codemount/code or creating a mount point directory as with codemount_smbfs/code).  codeopen smb://myshare._smb._tcp.local/share_name//code (quotes aren't necessary)  The share will be mounted in /Volumes, and you can open the file in Preview with this command:  codeopen /Volumes/share_name/path_to_file/my_file.pdf/code  The two commands can be combined into a one-liner with code&amp;&amp;/code:  codeopen smb://myshare._smb._tcp.local/share_name/ &amp;&amp; open /Volumes/share_name/path_to_file/my_file.pdf/code  I tested all of the above [OS X 10.9.5], and unless I made a typo somewhere it should work. Good luck.  <answer154898> didn't you just try "open -a Preview /path-to-your-file.pdf"  <comment182097> Is the SMB share mounted in `/Volumes/myshare`? As a workaround you could try `open -a /Applications/Preview.app /Volumes/myshare/path/to/file/my_file.pdf` instead. <comment182106> what does happen when you just try to run this command: /Applications/Preview.app ? does it open the Preview App ? <comment182125> @harlock59 You cannot run applications like that - it gives error that `Applications/Preview.app: is a directory`. @jaume - I want it to work when the share is not mounted - that is why I am passing the server path. <comment182127> That doesn't work either - it does seem to launch the app if not open, but it doesn't open the file in the app and opens just the folder instead. <comment182230> http://www.wikihow.com/Open-Applications-Using-Terminal-on-Mac <comment182232> in google super searcher mode !! <comment182280> Doesn't work, @harlock59
