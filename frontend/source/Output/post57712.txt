Hide username from menu bar <body> In Mountain Lion, my full name is displayed at the right of the menu bar (between the time and the search icon, to be specific). As it takes a lot of space, I was wondering if there is a way to hide this?  <answer57714> You just have to press the Command key while dragging the username out of the menu bar like you would to remove a dock item.  <answer57715> ol liOpen strongSystem Preferences/strong/li liSelect strongUser &amp; Groups/strong/li liSelect strongLogin Options/strong (emnot/em Login Items)/li li(Click the lock to make changes at the lower left corner of the window)/li liUncheck "Show fast user switching menu as .../li /ol  <answer57721> This is the fast user switching menu, which can be Command + dragged off.

No idea why it did that; I've never had fast user switching enabled on this laptop, and it only has one user account, so it doesn't even make sense for to be on. <comment66620> I didn't know it wasn't specific to 10.8, but I only noticed it after the upgrade. <comment81673> Thanks, this helped me with a reverse problem;) <comment115410> Awesome "trick"! <comment221770> Thanks, this worked even when the accepted method didn't.
