Headphone volume low <body> This just started happening recently. When I plug my headphones in, I get full high fidelity volume for a fraction of a second and then it becomes significantly muted.  I've checked "Sound" in Preferences to ensure that I've not reduced my system volume.   Any other ideas on what might be causing this?  UPDATE:  ul liTried restarting (multiple times)/li liTried resetting NVRAM to no avail/li /ul  System Specs: MBP 15" Mid-2014 on Yosemite  <comment275644> Ever find a solution? <comment277318> nope, not yet, please let me know if you did!
