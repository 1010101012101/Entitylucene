USB drive won't mount <body> I'm having a problem with a USB thumb drive that I used to be able to read and write to with no issues. On two different Macs: MacBook Pro and iMac, it doesn't mount. It doesn't even show up in DiskUtility. The only thing that happens when it gets plugged in is that codedmesg/code shows the line codeUSBMSC Identifier (non-unique): 0x58f 0x1234 0x1/code. I checked System Profiler and it showed the following for the device:  precodeMass Storage Device:    Product ID:   0x1234   Vendor ID:    0x058f  (Alcor Micro, Corp.)   Version:   0.01   Speed:    Up to 480 Mb/sec   Manufacturer: Alcor Micro   Location ID:  0xfa200000 / 2   Current Available (mA):   500   Current Required (mA):    100 /code/pre  Which to me looks like everything's good. Through some googleing I found out about USB Prober. Someone said that after running USB Prober their drive showed up. I ran the tool, but my drive didn't appear, and it showed this output for my device:  precodeHigh Speed device @ 2 (0xFA200000): .............................................

Don't even remember what happened to that drive.
