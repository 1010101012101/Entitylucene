Failed to update using wifi <body> I can update my apps in app store using cellular data but i have failed to update them using WiFi. I have tried resetting all the phone settings and resetting the phone and it has still failed. I use an iPhone 4 and an operating system of 7.1.  <comment326981> Have you tried different wifi networks to rule out a problem on the one you're using?  Can you browse the web, get email? What parameters appear when connected to the problematic wifi on Settings  Wi-Fi  and tapping the â“˜ to the right of the SSID? Also, check if Settings  General  VPN has anything configured.
