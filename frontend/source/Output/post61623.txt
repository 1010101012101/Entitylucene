Disable voiceover on login <body> I bought a used Mac from someone who was using VoiceOver on the login screen.  I don't have any handicap, and I would like to disable VoiceOver, which I personally find annoying.  Strangely, VoiceOver is ONLY on the login screen, and I can't find an option to disable it emanywhere/em on the computer. Also VoiceOver seems to come along with some sort of highlighting and on screen text.  Any help? I am running on Lion.  <answer61628> Being enabled only on the Login Screen you must disable it under strongSystem Preferences / Users &amp; Groups/strong. If the preferences are locked, click the lock icon in the lower-left corner of the page and type and administrator password to unlock them. Click strongLogin Options/strong and uncheck the emUse VoiceOver at Login Window/em.  VoiceOver, along with other features of this kind, can be enabled, and hence disabled, under strongSystem Preferences / Universal Access/strong.  <comment71153> it was SO hidden!! <comment155397> THANK YOU SIR.
