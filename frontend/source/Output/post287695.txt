Advanced configuration for email notifications about Apple Developer Certificates expiration <body> Mainly, I just wanted to ask the same question here, because the community here is active (comparing to what is seen on Apple Developer Forums, unfortunately):  https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/29994  So in other words, I need to understand strongwho/strong in my Developer Program strongemreceives the email notifications/em/strong about impending expiration of the following:  ul liiOS Distribution certificate/li liApple Push Services certificates/li liAPNs Development iOS certificates/li liVoIP Services certificates/li /ul  I want the email notifications from Apple to be sent to specific set of email addresses.  It does not look smart to me sending such email to Team Agent only, since he may miss it (for various reasons) and the app functionality will eventually fail. Definitely this must be received at least by developers who are admins and are responsible for managing Certificates/Profiles on company production servers. I have a distribution list mailbox for all interested parties and would like to subscribe it to those expiration notification emails.  Thanks for your attention.
