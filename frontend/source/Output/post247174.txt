How can I get photos in iPhone by wire? <body> I need to get photos from my Mac to my iPhone, but best way I found was by AirDrop, but it is too slow (I need to transfer lot of photos). I would think that it would be faster by wire, but I didn't find any way...  <answer247177> Let iTunes do that for you, check how to do it here in the apple documentation  Here's what the overall steps are as described in the link in case it dies:  ol liMake sure that you have the latest version of iTunes./li liOpen iTunes on your computer./li liUse the included USB cable to connect your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch to your computer./li liClick on the device icon in iTunes./li liClick Photos in the sidebar./li liClick the box next to "Sync Photos." If instead you see "iCloud Photos is On," all your photos and videos are already on all of your devices that use iCloud Photo Library. You don't need to sync them through iTunes./li liIn the drop-down menu, choose the app or folder that you want to sync from./li liChoose to sync all photos or selected albums.  Select "Include videos" to sync the videos from your app or folder too. Click Apply./li /ol  There are also 3rd party apps like RollIt that does that job too without iTunes, however it's paid
