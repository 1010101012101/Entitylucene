Can not successfully re-install MYSQL 10.8.2 <body> Removed the old installation as explained here:  https://superuser.com/questions/129193/how-do-i-uninstall-mysql-on-mac-os-x-snow-leopard  Installed the package contained in the mysql 5.1.67 DMG downloaded from MySql.com Installed the preference pane item Installed the startup item [THIS FAILED]  MySql will not load, it's preference pane show the error message displayed below:  precode The MySql database server installation was not found.   Please make sure the /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqladmin file is present /code/pre  I don't have much familiarity with unix commands so I'm not clear how to troubleshoot this further.  <answer79031> Try to uninstall the lates version completely and install the new one. According to your error log i think that you have another mysql server running on your machine. Try to find it out and uninstall it.  <answer123828> I got the same problem after installing mySql through homebrew codebrew install mysql/code.  After digging for a while, I realized that the problem was a missing symbolic link.  Since my codemySql/code was installed in code/usr/local/mysql-5.6.12-osx10.7-x86_64/code and not in code/usr/local/mysql/code as expected, all I did was create the symbolic link to map this missing path:  precodecd /usr/local sudo ln -s mysql-5.6.12-osx10.7-x86_64 mysql /code/pre  Now I can access code/usr/local/mysql/code, and the mySql on System Preferences works fine.  <comment91324> Is /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqladmin present? If so what does running it in Terminal show? <comment91337> UPDATE: I downloaded the 32-bit package (I had previously installed the 64 bit one) and it is installed. However, it will not run still. The error message in the preference pane now says: "Warning - The /Users/snp/emaildb/  directory is not owned by the 'mysql or _mysql user" <comment91339> That user directory is nothing to do with a plain mysql install- you must have some configuration or other program using it (and probably mysql) <comment91361> Ok so I did a complete uninstall again. Also uninstalled Logitech Media Server which is the only other thing on my system using sql. Rebooted. Did another install of the x64 bit version. Now I am back to getting the message that the MySql Database Server installation was not found, despite the fact that the installer reported a successful install. <comment91364> I tried another install, this one fails and reports these errors: (can't display them not enough characters available) <comment91390> try to make an update on OS. may be this can help you
