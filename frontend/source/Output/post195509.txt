iCloud login issue <body> I have lost my @me.com password and answer to 2nd security question. I have tried many ways but all suggestions ends at verify via email which I have lost password to access and 2nd is answer the security question which I have lost too.  Is there any way out or just dump the device and move to android (they got real time support).  Look forward to hear your honest advise.  Regards, Kazi  <answer195510> If moving to Android is an option, then you clearly don't need anything that's in the account. So just create a new one and link your device to that account instead. And when you do create a new account, be sure to link a mobile phone number and another email address to it, so that the same thing can't happen again.  <comment233412> Duplicate of http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/195500/46541 <comment233419> possible duplicate of [Our iPad is locked and we're not sure of the Apple ID / iCloud password](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/116010/our-ipad-is-locked-and-were-not-sure-of-the-apple-id-icloud-password)
