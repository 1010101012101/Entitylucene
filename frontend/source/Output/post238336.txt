Can digital certificates stored in iPads used for wifi authentication be used to authenticate in web applications? <body> I would like to use the same digital certificates already stored in my iPads to authenticate in the wifi (WPA2-EAP), to be used to authenticate to web applications.  I know that if this is possible, web applications would need to be updated to support this option.  Is this possible? Can these digital certificates be used for this?  <comment292309> Please clarify 'authenticate in the wifi'. <comment292788> @Brick Login in WPA2-EAP
