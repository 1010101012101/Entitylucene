I have a Macbook Air, early 2014. How do i get 3840x2160 resolution output? <body> I am getting only 1080p on my 4K TV, via thunderbolt to HDMI adapter. I want to know how to get more resolution output.   <answer182065> The GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) on a 2014 Air doesn't support 4K resolutions over HDMI, you'd need a newer model for this (early 2015).  Source: Using 4K displays and Ultra HD TVs with your Mac (apple.com)  <answer182066> That Macbook Air is only capable of 2560 x 1600 maximum resolution, according to Everymac     Although Apple only reports that this model can support a single external display up to 2560x1600, Intel reports that this model can simultaneously support two external displays up to 2560x1600 "daisy chained" via Thunderbolt.   There's a possibility you are limited to 1080p by the HDMI cable. make sure it's HDMI 1.4 capable.
