Time Machine backup from external hard drive stuck in trash <body> I got a new iMac after my old one died. As my old one was dying I made several Time Machine backups to a 1T G-Drive external. Unfortunately, I must have done it incorrectly because the backups have used up so much of the space on the external that there's not enough room to back up my new iMac to the external. The Time Machine backup for the old iMac could not have been more than 350 GB, so, I am a bit perplexed. Last night I attempted to remove some of the older multiple backups of the same files from the old machine by dragging them to the trash. It seemed to work until I got to the next most recent backup and when the files finally copied over to the trash the window said there were more than 1,500,000 files! After waiting for hours for the trash to empty, I finally gave up when their were something like 1,200,000 files remaining. Am I going to be able to delete these files from this backup and free up space on my external drive so I can backup my new computer, or do I just need to give up and buy a new external?  <answer198462> Time Machine performs versioning backups at specific time intervals and keeps making backups until it runs out of space on the drive, then it starts to prune away older backups to make room for the new ones.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NGKNw.png" alt="enter image description here"  The only way that I know of to control the amount of space that any one Time Machine Backup uses is to set up a partition on the drive in Disk Utility and then have Time Machine back up to that partition.  You will not be able to delete some of the time machine backup as it is stored like a database, and it is an all or nothing delete.  hr     Response to Trash Question   If you have 1.2MM files, Secure delete will take a very long time to do this.  If you do not mind that the data will not be overwritten and only the file associations will be removed you can do this to clear out the Trash.

Yours is likely on the root of the drive itself. As I don't know what that path will be I can't give you that step. Just replace that path for the one after codecd/code.

It has an option to recover erases/deleted/trashed files.  I purchased it online during a Macheist bundle. Use another computer to do this as you don't want your imac to overwrite the trash.

You need to be in `/Volumes/volume_name/.Trashes/$UID/` and then use `sudo rm -fR *` although it's probably more safe to just use `sudo rm -fR /Volumes/volume_name/.Trashes/$UID/*` , e.g. `sudo rm -fR /Volumes/Backup/.Trashes/$UID/*` <comment237491> I had already edited. However for USB externals, Their trash bins do show up in the dock and you can drag out to get the paths for all of the files... But yes, actually specifying the exact path is likely a better idea than drag and drop. <comment237492> I still like to cd to the directory first that way if you accidentally hit return before entering the path you don't wipe your Home directory. <comment237493> In the case of the OP it has nothing to do with the Home directory and only `/Volumes/volume_name/.Trashes/$UID/*` and you are over complicating things for the OP to resolve his particular issue! <comment237494> And I added that to the edit as I said that I did not know the exact path his external drive would have. I also added your suggestion. <comment237495> Jeff, lets say the name of the external drive when you manually deleted things from the Time Machine backup is 'Backup" all you need is the following command to cleanup the mess: `sudo rm -fR /Volumes/Backup/.Trashes/$UID/*` <comment370996> I don't think this answers the question. Jeff Cline wants to delete files from the Time Machine backup. <comment371011> Time Machine essentially expects a partition pr machine to backup.  If you need to use a disk for multiple machines, partition it.  Note that OS X Server appears to be able to control the disk space for each time machine backup on it.
