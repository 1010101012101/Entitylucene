My iPhone is sending iMessage from my e-mail, however its activated to send from my number? <body> My iPhone is sending iMessages from my e-mail, but when I go to change it to my number it's supposed to be sending from my number? When I send a text message it is from my phone but not my iMessage? I've looked in Settings - Messages and it does not say waiting for activation as it is already activated. I just want it to send from my number for both iMessage and text.  <comment167619> Is Settings - Messages - Send & Receive - Start New Conversations From set to your mobile number? <comment167621> I've just tried it and it states that i can be reached by iMessage by my number, even though it is my email!it is highlighted grey so i cannot click on it at all! <comment167625> I think you're looking at "YOU CAN BE REACHED BY IMESSAGE AT". Your phone number will always be greyed out there. Look at the section below titled "START NEW CONVERSATIONS FROM". What is selected there? <comment167731> i do not have that selection below! <comment167733> Which version of iOS do you have on your phone? <comment167756> IOS.7.1.2 thats what it saids
