How can I open a port (not application) in the OS X 10.6 firewall? <body> Let me preface this by saying:  ul liI do not want to drop my firewall completely/li liYes, I really do need particular ports rather than an application./li /ul  So I see that there is the option to allow particular applications through the firewall, but no equivalent way of opening ports.  It seems hard to believe that this is actually impossible.  How can I open a specific TCP port in OS X 10.6 while keeping the rest of the ports firewalled?  <answer33875> The application WaterRoof will be able to let you do this and more.  <answer36922> TheÂ builtin firewall used by OS X is ipfw. To learn more about it from the Terminal you can enter codeman ipfw/code.  To create a new firewall rule to allow incoming traffic on to a particular port you can enter the rule from the Terminal as follows.  precodesudo ipfw add 40000 allow tcp from any to any dst-port portnum /code/pre  where codeportnum/code is the number of the port you wish opened. In this case I've added a rulenum of 40000 to the rule so that if you ever wanted to remove it the following command will suffice.  precodesudo ipfw delete 40000 /code/pre  If you enter the command codesudo ipfw list/code you will see the active commands. To reload the firewall issue the command codesudo ipfw flush/code  If you want to log the hits the rule is getting you can add the codelog/code command as follows, codesudo ipfw add 40000 allow log .../code  I chose the rulenum 40000 somewhat arbitrarily as rules exist from 1 to 65535, though certain numbers are privileged. This just makes it easier to delete the rule later, if needed.  <answer71299> Worked for me.  I wanted to open traffic on port 70, so I entered the following:  precodesudo ipfw add 7000 allow tcp from any to any dst-port 70 /code/pre  The response from the command-prompt was:  precode07000 allow tcp from any to any dst-port 70 /code/pre  Yes, the 0 was automatically added to the rule #, so it is worth noting that any rule ID &lt; 10,000 will be prefixed by one or more zeroes.  <comment72928> Tried the above solution and got the error: ipfw: hostname ``dst-port'' unknown <comment73142> What exactly did you input? <comment103372> As I wrote above, you need to specify the actual port number for `portnum` but `dst-port` is correct. Please refer to man page for ipfw. <comment139163> Or the open source IceFloor (http://www.hanynet.com/icefloor/index.html) for the PF firewall in OS X 10.7 and later. <comment243310> Apparently this command is gone in 10.10 (Yosemite).
