Finder closes and reopens over and over <body> I recently created a RAID 1 set with two external 2TB drives, and it caused me lots of issues.  First, my iMac (10.8.4) kernel panicked a dozen times before I found out it was the 256k block size which freaked it out. After formatting both drives again, now I have a working RAID set (with 128k block size).  Cool, if it wasn't for this little thing: open Finder windows now close and reopen every minute or so.  It seems like an unexpected crash, but Finder says nothing: it just closes all the open windows and instantly reopens them, blocking every copy/move in progress. The rest of the OS is fine, every other app is working.  Could it be related to the new RAID set? If not, how can I solve this problem? I found only threads from 2007 to 2008, like this.  <comment120949> Are there any relevant log messages? You could try removing `~/Library/Saved Application State/com.apple.finder.savedState/` or `~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist`.
