How to recover IMAP folders from iCloud? <body> I accidentally (!!) deleted a synched IMAP folder on iCloud from Mail.app. It was a large project folder with many clients in it but none of them show up in deleted messages.  This is incredibly urgent and devastating. Can anyone tell me how to perform a recovery? Initial Google searches have revealed surprisingly little on that scenario.  <comment62485> In ~/Library/Mail, the folder still exists even with all the subfolders. Problem is that only one subfolder holds a Info.plist and thus only that folder shows up in mail. All other folders a empty. <comment62487> If the folders are empty, the content is gone. Did you check the Trash on icloud.com (small chance though) and the Trash on your Mac? <comment62494> Do you have Time Machine backups?
