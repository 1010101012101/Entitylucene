Why does restart ipad fix website spam redirect? <body> I was helping someone with their iPad that was redirecting a webpage to spam.  The site was a respectable news site, and loaded fine on other devices.  On his ipad, half way through loading the page it redirected to other sites - you have a virus, download this etc.  I wiped all safari data - Clear History and Website Data.  But the redirect continued.  I tried other browsers but was still redirected.    Network - Other devices on his network loaded the site fine, and moving the ipad to another network still had redirects.  Then we turned the machine off and on again, and it was fixed on all browsers.  Why would this be?  I am guessing it might be a cache issue but wiping the data should have cleared the cache?  How would ha have got the problem to start with?  <comment300669> Could it be malware tricking you into thinking it was fixed after restart? <comment300965> it didnt redirect.  It redirected before.  Im not sure what you mean or why it is malware if it doesnt do anything.
