App store update loop since sierra <body> My app store is somehow corrupted. I have installed Sierra, Numbers, Pages and Keynote. However I can install Sierra as often as I want. The app store does not recognize it to be installed and offers me the option to install it again. Further and even more annoying the three office apps permanently appear in the updates tab and are stuck in an update loop: They appear in the updates tab after installing they simply appear again. Is this a known problem to anyone and are there any solutions?
