If the Apple Watch has wifi - does it connect to my local router? <body> It would appear the Apple Watch has the ability to communicate via wifi.   When I set mine up, I didn't have a step to identify my local router, so I assume it may have obtained configuration about my local router from my phone, or that it doesn't connect (directly) to my router at all.   My question is: strongIf the Apple Watch has wifi - does it connect to my local router?/strong  <answer188431> Yes. It uses the wifi networks already configured on your phone. Mine worked over my home network perfectly with zero configuration on my part.
