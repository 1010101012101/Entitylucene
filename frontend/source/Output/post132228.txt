mac pro going to sleep on nohup <body> I have the following scenario. I have shell scripts that I want to run remotely on my mac pro, so I ssh in, launch them with nohup, and log out.  I've done this for years on linux based machines, and I just started trying it out on the new mac pro.  However, I find that the mac goes to sleep while these are running, and it takes much longer to finish.  Obviously I can disable sleep in the energy preferences, but there are definitely times when I want it to let it power down.  Is there anything I could do, in terms of a command line argument, that would disable sleep while the process was running?  <answer132269> You can use codepmset/code to temporarily prevent mac from going to sleep.  codepmset noidle &amp; PMSETPID=${!};sleep 10; kill $PMSETPID/code  Replace codesleep 10/code with your command.  You can also write a function and save it to code.bash_profile/code.  precodeinsomnia() {     pmset noidle &amp;     PMSETPID=$!     $($@)     kill $PMSETPID } /code/pre  and use it like this: code$ insomnia sleep 10/code  I recommend to use codescreen/code instead of codenohup/code.  Edit: emon newer Macs you should use codecaffeinate/code as described by Graham Miln. codepmset noidle/code still works, but since 10.9 it is marked as "deprecated" in the documentation./em  <answer132273> h2caffeinate your scripts/h2  Use the OS X built-in caffeinate command to prevent your Mac going to sleep. codecaffeinate/code is the recommended way of lodging a temporary restriction against your Mac entering a low power state.     codecaffeinate/code creates assertions to alter system sleep behavior. If no   assertion flags are specified, caffeinate creates an assertion to   prevent idle sleep. If a utility is specified, caffeinate creates the   assertions on the utility’s behalf, and those assertions will persist   for the duration of the utility’s execution. Otherwise, caffeinate   creates the assertions directly, and those assertions will persist   until caffeinate exits.   <answer136650> I made a function inside my ~/code.bash_profile/code, like so:  precode# ~/.bash_profile  # wrap ssh so computer doesn't go to sleep ssh() {     echo "caffeinating ssh session..."     LC_CTYPE= # fix issue with UTF8 on server     caffeinate -i ssh "$@" } /code/pre  Now when I use my "common" the ssh command it get wrapped in strongcaffeinate/strong therefore keeps the system from going to sleep.  Now when i start a ssh session, i can see codepmset -g/code telling me:  precodesleep                10 (sleep prevented by caffeinate) /code/pre  <comment162159> Very nice indeed!
