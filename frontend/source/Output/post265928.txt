How do I save terminal output to a file? <body> How do I save the output of a command to a file from terminal?  That is if my command gives some output and it is printed directly on terminal but I want it in some text file or may be other kind of file.  <answer265929> Just add right sided arrow after your command:  precodesomeCommand &gt; someFile.txt   /code/pre  Or if you want to append data(will create file if it doesn't exist):  precodesomeCommand &gt;&gt; someFile.txt /code/pre
