Add GPS Coordinates to iPhone Contact <body> I like to hike (with dogs).  Please how can I add GPS coordinates to an iPhone contact address field or otherwise like "the lodge near Au Sable Falls, NY" at 44.181430, -73.965213.  There is no road within 2 miles. I can add it into the Notes field but minor pain to copy/paste each time I need the information.  <answer194044> I added your coordinates Apple Maps, I don't know if the place is correct,  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xes3S.jpg" alt="pin at coordinates on Apple Maps"  anyway, after finding the correct location on the map, tap and hold if there is no pin to drop one, and then tap on the pin to show options.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xJBGH.jpg" alt="dropped pin options"  You can create a new contact or add to an existing one from there.  <answer194045> I would create new contact named "the lodge near Au Sable Falls" or your choice.  Then in the home address enter the coordinate 44.181430, 73.965213  It will now allow you to show it on the map.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JkvIh.jpg" alt="location"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0DtjA.jpg" alt="location"  <answer242076> Drop a pin to the location. Then do the following:  ol liTap Share icon./li liChoose Mail. Then a mail draft will open./li liSend the mail to yourself./li liOpen the received mail in iPhone. The mail will have "Dropped Pin.loc.vcf" attached./li liTap "Dropped Pin.loc.vcf". Then Contacts App will be launched./li /ol  Then you have the map URL. (The coordinate is embedded in the URL as well.)  <answer265311> Use ABGPS app : http://roudgersoft.com/en/app/abgps/  ABGPS  • adds your GPS location to your Contacts cards.  • opens your favorite navigation app directly from the device address book.  <answer287647> You can do it using a workaround, by adding a URL to a contact. In the URL you type http://www.google.com/maps/place/(coordinates), for example:  http://www.google.com/maps/place/29.927639,31.078943  Now when you open the contact and click on that URL it'll open the location in Google Maps.  <comment231888> No,when i select/touch the GPS coordinate in the contact (getting it there works fine), nothing happens. I had thought that was working some time ago, but it hasn't worked for some time, at least since iOS 8.3, maybe before.  Obviously I should go 8.4 but am hesitant because it's iPhone 5, and already a bit sluggish, and poor on battery, and I don't want to use Apple Music (yet), AND I lost all my many KB shortcuts with 8.3.  Thanks.  (the coordinates are wrong cause I haven't been there lately, just wanted to make the question interesting--it IS one of the nicest places on Earth :) ) <comment231892> did you pay attention how to enter the coordinates numbers ? <comment232339> I tested entering GPS three ways ways; 1. Add from maps, 2. copy and paste from whatsmygps.com, or similar Safari site, and 3. copy and paste from compass app.  If I have to actually type them manually that's too kludge and defeats the purpose.  Thanks. <comment233558> So far no correct answers; the methods above add an address but not a GPS location.  That's not helpful when hiking off-road.  Anybody actually know how to do this? <comment233559> So far no correct answers; the methods above add an address but not a GPS location.  That's not helpful when hiking off-road.  Anybody actually know how to do this? <comment233563> Maybe we're answering the wrong question, what would be the purpose of having the GPS coordinates added to the contact? <comment235214> Having GPS in contact is the easiest way to find them later.  I suppose I could copy and paste them into an app like OneNote or EverNote if I am anal about documenting with keywords, but that's painful both at the time of save, AND when finding later.  Too much copy and paste, and no SIMPLE, quick way to search for, especially when out of range.  As mentioned, i'm pretty sure I was able to do this some time ago. <comment235217> But are this places or persons? For places I use other apps, like Garmin's Basecamp, Motion-X GPS For instance, that have some tracking / waypoint capabilities that may be of use.
