What is the difference between iTerm2 and Terminal? <body> I keep hearing that iTerm2 is much better than Terminal. I downloaded iTerm2 today and played around with it, but I couldn't see what is so much better about iTerm2. iTerm2 seemed just like Terminal.br What is the difference between iTerm2 and Terminal? Why do you use iTerm2 and not Terminal? Basically, convince me that I should switch to iTerm2.  <answer25146> There are several features listed on their features page.  Some of the features I like are:  ul liSplit pane view/li liHotkey window for instant terminal anywhere/li liSearch will highlight all found words (like in Chrome and Safari)/li liMouseless copy/li liInstant replay (can "rewind" your session in case you forgot to note/copy something)/li liPaste history/li liGrowl support for notification when a process completes/li /ul  <answer25179> The feature I chose iTerm for is being able to cut or copy by just selecting text and paste by just using the middle button  <answer25180> @joel's answer is good, but Terminal.app gained some exclusive features in Lion:  ul lisupport for Lion's restore feature/li lisupport for system services - this means I have a system shortcut for “new terminal in this folder” without strange hacks./li lisupport for system services means great automator integration/li lidocument proxy in the window and generally better D&amp;D support/li liright click on a string to search in man pages or open its man page in a cool floating window. Really handy!/li /ul  See: http://www.macosxautomation.com/lion/terminal.html  <answer25234> Besides the features already listed, iTerm2 is constantly improving, while Terminal receives minor updates every few years. Feature requests have a much better chance of being honored in iTerm2. There are some cool things coming in the next release that are not yet documented, but have a look through the recent release notes to see them:  http://code.google.com/p/iterm2/source/browse/trunk/appcasts/testing_changes.html  Also, I'd note that there's some confusion about split panes in a comment in the OP. Terminal's split panes give you two views of the same window, while iTerm2's give you unlimited independent terminals in one tab.  <answer25448> I just love iTerm because it does have the auto-complete for commands.thats just awesome.  From the feature list for iTerm2's on its website:     Just type the start of any word that has ever appeared in your window   and then Cmd-; will pop open a window with suggestions. The word   you're looking for is usually on top of the list!   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/03LjW.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer81381> iTerm supports opening windows in full screen by default, and there is an option to use custom full screen windows that don't have the animations for changing spaces and don't disable ⌘H.  It also has an incremental search banner instead of a find dialog. And you can select text by searching for the start and pressing tab to extend the selection by single words.  <answer87703> If you're a keen user of VIM then mouse mode in iTerm2 works properly - you can position the cursor and select text using the mouse (it kind of works in Terminal but it's buggy). Plus when you're running VIM (or other console based apps that use the 'alternate' screen (t_ti, t_te)) then the scrolling works properly too.  <answer220734> I use iTerm2 since I can't configure my Mac Terminal have different colors background when I open different Terminals.  <answer236043> From the iTerm2 web site:     iTerm2 has a lot of features. Every conceivable desire a terminal user might have has been foreseen and solved. And these are just the main attractions!   iTerm2's feature page highlights the following:  ol liSplit Panes/li liHotkey Window/li liSearch Highlighted/li liAutocomplete/li liMouseless Copy/li liPaste History/li liInstant Replay/li liConfigurability/li liUnixyness/li li256 Colors (or more!)/li liReadability/li liMouse Reporting/li liGrowl Support/li liExposé Tab/li liTagged Profiles/li liMulti-Lingual/li liTriggers/li liSmart Selection/li liShell Integration/li liAutomatic Profile Switching/li liInline Images/li liTimestamps/li liPassword Manager/li liAdvanced Paste/li liAnnotations/li liBadges/li liCaptured Output/li /ol  <comment28365> honestly, terminal has gotten much better from LeopardSLLion. iTerm used to be required, now it is just a bit nice. I actually switched back to Terminal in Lion now that ANSI colors are fully supported. No more SIMBL! <comment28397> Press Cmd+Shift+D and learn. <comment28473> @Fake Awesome! But Terminal does that already. <comment28509> I understand those are standard X11/Xterm behaviors, but they are not standard for Mac OS X applications. Other than being used to it, why are those significantly more convenient than the usual Copy/Paste commands? Note: Terminal has partial support for Middle-Click, which invokes the Paste Selection command. <comment28511> As always, if something is important to you, please file a detailed enhancement request or bug report at https://bugreport.apple.com . That's the best way to ensure that your voice is heard. Talking about it online is hit-or-miss. Though, Lion Terminal does have a number of enhancements and fixes partly due to feedback seen online. <comment28512> 256 colors, Background Color Erase (BCE), customizable ANSI colors, Full Screen, status indicators in the tabs and Dock icons, including live terminal displays in minimized windows. Oh, and, a much improved visual bell :-) <comment28755> because you don't use the keyboard using these , alos less actions to do the copy and also you can copy from a window that you do not have to click to get the focus <comment28795> Make sure you label this as iTerm2 a different development altogether. <comment28797> So does Terminal. <comment28798> @slomojo I should change the name to iTerm2? <comment28799> @daviesgeek It will avoid confusion, the two are totally different products, iTerm is pretty much abandoned at this point, while iTerm2 is in very active development. <comment28800> Although autocompletion is a feature of `bash` and other shells (`zsh` has particularly awesome autocomplete) and not the Terminal app itself. iTerm2 also has a special autocompletion mode too ... http://www.iterm2.com/#/section/features/autocomplete <comment28809> @slomojo yes,the ⌘-; is pretty much cool. <comment28834> I have to add that, personally, I think the zsh completion is about the best I've used inside a shell / terminal. (Especially when used with [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) - [by the way...take note.](http://tumblr.mobocracy.net/post/9078264612/iterm2-oh-my-zsh-speed)) <comment29020> @daviesgeek - Hmmm, looks like they added that in lion. <comment29024> @FakeName I have it in SL. <comment29060> @daviesgeek - What the hell is going on..... <comment29061> @slomojo I see now. (the picture explains it) <comment60170> @ChrisPage you might want to add that you need to be a registered Apple Developer to be able to log on to that website. <comment60495> @WimDeblauwe: Yes, you need a free developer account to create a bug report. Also note that you can use http://www.apple.com/feedback/macosx.html without any sort of account. Having a (free) developer account means you can track your bug report’s status. <comment79084> I cant get the autocomplete working on my Iterm2.When I do command-, it zoom in the entire window. Nevermind got this working, had to put a colon also, but can I get the same functionality through tab? <comment79085> Also, whenever I type command+-+; along with the autocomplete window, it reduces the window size. <comment121356> the tags for iterm2 and iterm seem to be merged; tagging iterm2 completes to the tag iterm. AND in 2013 the terminal basically has all of iterm2's features covered. <comment159732> Amazing! I've always wanted that feature on! :) It seems that it doesn't work on Terminal, why is that? like, :set mouse=a doesnt do anything which I guess is the point, iTerm2 is better :) <comment165538> @FakeName Nothing happens when I press Cmd+Shift+D in terminal, I suppose thats what you meant not iTerm <comment267202> You mean...  Shell  New Window  pick your theme here?    The default terminal app definitely allows you to choose a different color per window. <comment267203> If you prefer a tabbed view...   Shell  New Tab  pick your theme here.   Each tab will have its own color scheme. <comment267211> how you can set each tab window to different color theme? <comment267212> As mentioned above.   From the menu bar at the top of the screen, select Shell  New Tab  then pick the color scheme you want to use for the new tab. <comment267213> it does't work on my Mac Version 10.9.5. <comment267214> Gotcha... I'm using 10.11.2, tabbed windows (for Finder, Terminal) were introduced in 10.10 or 10.11 (can't remember which) <comment267216> ok, it works now. if  just press CMD-T and just new tab for default color theme.  I'm  looking for that for long time. Thanks <comment279037> My opinion? Basically, it's the difference between a rolls royce and a honda.  Both will get you where you want to go, but one of them is a much nicer ride with a lot of nice features.  The current beta version has even more features.  Wonderful.
