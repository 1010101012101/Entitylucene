Setting .plist path to user Library <body> I have created a OS X launch agent that is installed per user. It is listening socket and automatically launched when socket connection arrives. On my .plist I have  precode    &lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;array&gt; &lt;string&gt;~/Library/Containers/com.mycompany.myproduct/myproduct.app/Contents/MacOS/myproduct&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;/array&gt;  /code/pre  When connecting to my launch agent socket I get a message in console saying my launch agent is not found. When changing .plist ProgramArguments to  precode&lt;string&gt;/Users/myusername/Library/Containers/com.mycompany.myproduct/myproduct.app/Contents/MacOS/myproduct&lt;/string&gt; /code/pre  Launch agent is loaded correctly. So it looks like I need to modify .plist for each user during launch agent installation. How can I do this automatically or easily? Is there a standard way for this? Or should I do something totally differently here to achieve what I want?  <answer95324> Use EnableGlobbing:  precode&lt;key&gt;EnableGlobbing&lt;/key&gt; &lt;true/&gt; &lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt; &lt;array&gt;     &lt;string&gt;~/Library/Containers/com.mycompany.myproduct/myproduct.app/Contents/MacOS/myproduct&lt;/string&gt; &lt;/array&gt;  /code/pre  It works with ProgramArguments but not with Program.  <comment111791> Why not install for all users and so in /Library/Containers/com.mycompany.myproduct/.... <comment111796> I thought there is something like this, but never seen it before. Brilliant. <comment111798> Mark, my user agent is a helper app for Mac App Store app - should I then install it for all users? Users can download the helper from my website to extend main app functionality beyond sandbox limits. If yes I should probably also move launch agent from ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ to /Library/LaunchAgents/ ? <comment111809> Based on documents this is what I need, but after adding EnableGlobbing to my plist I still get the same error. <comment111811> Also, there is no directory /Library/Containers/ on my Mac, should I just create one for my launch agent to work? <comment111979> I solved the problem by installing launch agent to /Library/LaunchAgents.
