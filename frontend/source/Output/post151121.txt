Cannot find users on login screen - only guest login available <body> I am using OS X Mavericks and when I boot the machine I only see the guest login.br When I log in as a guest everything functions correctly but I can't access my files.. I ran OSX utilities and all my drives were verified with no errors.  How do I find my accounts again?  <answer151134> When at the login screen showing just the Guest user hold down kbdOption/kbd  or kbdalt/kbd and the right arrow key.  It will populate more users if they exist.  If that doesn't work you can boot into either single user mode (guide to boot to single user) or Restore partition and open terminal.app and run this command:  precodedefaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow SHOWFULLNAME -bool yes /code/pre  This will change the login window to be the name and password field.  Then you can enter your username.  <comment177821> Did you run the disk utility restore preferences?
