Web Visit Generator - Similar to JingLing <body> I would like to know if there is a software for Mac similar to JingLing for Windows. I am looking for a free desktop software to generate automatic visits to my websites.  If you know something online it would be OK also.  <answer196507> A quick Google Search shows that a lot of others have asked this question before, but with no real answers. Instead people are suggesting using Bootcamp.  <comment234730> Yep, what I don't want is use Bootcamp, that is why I am asking. <comment234731> I understand that but this question has been asked before, no one has offered an alternative solution, thats why I am saying it. Have you considered using Terminal + Apache Bench?
