How can I keep a Java-based pop-up open even when its parent page is closed? <body> I'd like to run the Java client for Runescape but want to quit Safari while the Java pop-up is open. How can I do this?  My idea was finding out the URL of the client and running it through the codejava/code terminal command, but I'm having huge difficulty location the URL. =/  <answer30901> The runescape client is running as part of Safari so you can't quit Safari without killing the client. But you can delclose/del stronghide/strong the main Safari window (e.g. with kbdCmd-H/kbd) at least which will keep Safari running and the client open as well.  <answer31604> I tried looking a the source, but the website developer has embedded the applet information inside a bunch of JavaScript.  Also, even if you had the jar(s), if the applet requires communication back to the server, it would be a real pain to get it running.     For future reference, if they hadn't gotten all creative with the applet code, you could have simply run this command line:  precode$ appletviewer http://world87.runescape.com/ /code/pre   What I recommend is to create a dedicated strongFluid App/strong for the website.  It's super easy, just point Fluid at the base URL, and it creates a dedicated application wrapped around the website.  The coolest thing is that you can then simply launch your game directly from Applications.  emFluid is 100% free, and I am not affiliated with them in any way./em  <answer31619> Well, this won't answer the question but will solve your problem: use the downloadable version of Runespace.  Then, for the question itself: you couldn't do what you're asking for, since Safari is responsible for the Java plugin. The only way would be to download the applet code and use the command @OverZealous gave.  <comment35542> I wish, it still closes =/ <comment35549> Ah yes, the Java applet is linked to the main runescape window so you can't close that on. Hidding would be possible though. <comment35591> any chance to isolate the jar file and run it solo? i had no luck with it so far :s <comment36247> The downloadable version has issues running certain graphics modes. Also, I have Fluid, but it avoids the reason i'm looking for the sole executable. I wish to have my mouse's keys to change to a profile specific to rs only when the client is the active window.
