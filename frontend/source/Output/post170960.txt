Application for manage and sync PDF collection <body> Unfortunately is not possible synch the PDFs files  using iBook, so i'm looking for an alternative. I have a huge collection of PDF file and i work with different computers.  I'm looking for an application that can takes care of all my PDFs and generate an archive that can be put on Dropbox / iCloud Drive.  Sometink like Calibre but possibly with a better UX. It shouldn't be necessarely free.  Thanks.  <answer171102> Try one of these for PDF management:  http://reinventedsoftware.com/together/ This works with iCloud to access your library on multiple devices  http://www.ironicsoftware.com/yep/  You can also attach PDF's to notes in evernote.com  <comment201302> See: BibDesk, Papers, or Mendeley. <comment201337> together seems to be a nice app, i will try for a couple of week. thanks. <comment210892> I have no problems syncing PDF files in iBooks via iTunes.
