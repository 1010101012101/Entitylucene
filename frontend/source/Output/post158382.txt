Why doesn't Google Drive show up in the list of apps when sharing a photo? <body> ol liOpen the Photos app/li liSelect an image/li liPull up the menu (bottom left icon)/li liAvailable apps are Message, Mail, Twitter, etc./li /ol  Google Drive does not show up in that list (which seems to be called "Activities").  I have signed in to the Google Drive app and even restarted my phone.  <answer158408> For Google Drive to show in an extensions list, the app must have been updated to support these extensions in iOS 8. It would appear at this time that the app has not been updated to support this.  <answer189349> It's a pain, can't be done at this time, but you CAN go through the Drive APP and select + and Upload Video and Images option to do about the same, but its not as intuitive / easy I agree.  <answer257491> Answers above are old we are at iOS 10.  Google Drive did show and now it has disappeared just after successfully uploading from Photos to my Google Drive.  I'm signed in and can see my drive contents.  <comment186264> I find it hard to believe that Google forgot to add this feature to their app <comment186265> @ŠimeVidas Extensions are a relatively new addition to iOS and *most* apps are not updated to take advantage of this. <comment186273> I see. But still, iOS 8 didn’t fall from the sky, there was a beta. Google should have prepared app updates for the launch of iOS 8. It is incredible that users still aren't able to upload images to Drive from within the Photos app. (Unless, of course, I'm missing an alternative method - I *am* a brand new iPhone user.) <comment321537> I had to close and restart both apps.  now working.
