How to Tell Siri to Send a Text Message with Special Characters Such as Enter (Newline or EOL) - Dictation Commands <body> I'm using Siri a lot in my car to send text messages. The problem is I don't know how to convert characters into the text. Think like questionmarks (?), dots (.) and enters.  Example:  This is a question [questionmark]? [enter] End of text [dot].  Thanks in advance!  <answer230359>    This is a question?br   End of text.   Was generated by me sayingbr "this is a question question mark new line end of text full stop"br sub though I did have to then manually fake it into SE's markdown format /sub  SE isn't great for formatting tables, so this is really just in case the link ever disappears  Original Source [&amp; far easier to read] - Siri User Guide : Dictation Guide  precodeCommand                         Action                                          Before                                                                  After New line                        Move to the next line        New paragraph                   Start a new paragraph        Cap                             Capitalise the next word                        I like 'cap' sunshine                                                   I like Sunshine Caps on ... caps off            Capitalise a section of text                    'caps on' twenty types of flower 'caps off'                             20 Types of Flower All caps                        Make the next word all uppercase                I 'all caps' love summer                                                I LOVE summer All caps on ... all caps off    Make part of what you say uppercase             I 'all caps on' love summer 'all caps off'                              I LOVE SUMMER No caps                         Make the next word lowercase                    I like 'no caps' Capitals                                               I like capitals No caps on ... no caps off      Make sure part of what you say is all lowercase We like the cities 'no caps' London and Sydney 'no caps off' the most   We like the cities london and sydney the most Space bar                       Prevent a hyphen from appearing in a normally hyphenated word        No space                        Prevent a space between words        No space on ... no space off    Prevent a section of text from having spaces between words       "Period" or "full stop"         Place a "." at the end of a sentence         Dot .
