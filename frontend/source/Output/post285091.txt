Recurring iMessage error? <body> Recently, I was prompted with a notification that my Apple ID was being used for iMessage on an iPod touch. My family, nor I, own an iPod touch, so I immediately changed my Apple ID password. After logging back into everything on my phone and Macbook (the only two devices connected to the Apple ID), I tried signing back into iMessage on my laptop and received a message saying "An error occurred during activation. Try again." I'm not sure how to fix this, I've signed out of iCloud and back in, seeing if that would do anything. Nothing happened :/ I've tried and retried signing into iMessage, and no luck. Any help would be appreciated.
