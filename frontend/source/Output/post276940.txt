Get back my Photos from iPhone after taking backup with iTunes then restoring backup <body> I've tried to take a backup on iTunes for the first time, then delete all photos from the photo gallery. While restoring back to phone from iTunes, I accidentally pressed restore backup.  <comment348614> If you used iCloud for your photos **before** you did the restore then they should all still be there. <comment348625> Something doesn't add up â€” if you've taken a backup and then restored the backup, you shouldn't lose anything. Can you [edit] your question to clarify exactly the steps you performed?
