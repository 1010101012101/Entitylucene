Bootcamp Fails to Boot After Partitioning Drive OSX 10.11.6 (12/1/16) <body> This post was made because I cannot find any forums that address my specific problem. After 4 hours of searching and following instruction I have decided to ask for help.  So I've been trying to work on getting my partitioning corrected after a horrible mistake to create a partition that would be shared on both OS X and Windows 10. This problem has occurred to a significant amount of other people but I have been following quite a bit of forum posts to see where I can get.  I am always stopped to the problem of my disk1 not wanting to unmount. The thing that I have noticed the most is having a different disk number.   precode/dev/disk1 /code/pre  (This just might be me being inexperienced to recognize that disk one means nothing.)  I also tried gathering emfdisk /dev/disk1/em information but because I am writing this and gathering info I can't really do that. If it is required that I get this information I will edit the post.  So I tried to follow all the steps with the variable of emdisk(x)/em and still didn't get anywhere. I will post all of my outputs for my efforts.  Here is em/dev/disk0/em  precodeMacBook-Pro:~ Admin-Mac$ sudo fdisk /dev/disk0 Password: Disk: /dev/disk0    geometry: 60821/255/63 [977105060 sectors] Signature: 0xAA55          Starting       Ending  #: id  cyl  hd sec -  cyl  hd sec [     start -       size] ------------------------------------------------------------------------  1: EE 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [         1 -     409639] &lt;Unknown ID&gt;  2: AC 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [    409640 -  682350776] &lt;Unknown ID&gt;  3: AB 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [ 682760416 -    1269536] Darwin Boot  *4: 07 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [ 684029952 -  293074944] HPFS/QNX/AUX /code/pre  This is my first forum that I followed Repairing Boot Camp after creating new partition.

I got this to work once and I'm not sure how I bypass:  precodefdisk: /dev/disk0: Operation not permitted /code/pre  but after I inputed emy/em I continued to restart my computer and tried to access Windows 10. No luck.  I decided that I would do this in the Internet Recovery mode emCmd+Opt+R/em and I felt as if I was getting somewhere but closed the forum in habit of closing all of my apps on my iOS device.   I couldn't of saved the log from that console usage anyway due to it being on the IR mode.  With the Method I was using in Internet Recovery I was instructed to write down the emStart/em and emSize/em of the fourth partition and it was going to have me realign the partition somehow but I was again stopped short because the drive (even in Internet Recovery) would always say it was busy.   I'm not really sure where to go from here. I would love some help shedding light on the subject.
