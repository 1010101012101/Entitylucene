Phone is off / black when I plug it into charger, only the Apple logo is displayed <body> My small nephew dropped my iPhone 4s. There is a small crack on the screen. Now the iPhone is off / black and when I plug it into a charger only the Apple logo is displayed.   How can I retrieve my photos &amp; contact list from the mobile? Is it not repairable?  <answer267089> Give TinyUmbrella a try. It's a powerful tool to exit the recovery state of the iPhone without the data loss.  ol liMake sure that your iPhone is on (showing the Apple logo in your case)/li liConnect your iPhone to your computer via USB/li liDownload and install TinyUmbrella/li liLaunch TinyUmbrella and wait until it recognises your iPhone/li liAs iPhone gets recognised press codeexit recovery/code shown in the main menu/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Xp47N.png" alt="TinyUmbrella screenshot"  <answer284654> In most cases, you can solve these problems by putting the phone into recovery mode and restoring it from backup. To do that, follow these instructions:   ol liConnect the iPhone's USB cable to your computer, but not your iPhone./li liTurn your iPhone off. If the phone won't turn off in the traditional manner, just keep holding the buttons until the screen goes dark. /li liOnce you've turned the device off, press the home button on the face of the device and plug in the USB cable to the device's dock connector. /li liWhen it turns on, keep pressing the home button until the iTunes logo appears on the screen. /li liYou'll know the phone is now in recovery mode because a window in iTunes will tell you. /li liYou can then start the restore process by clicking the "Restore" button in the iTunes window./li /ol  If this still doesn't work, then you can use commercial software such as Dr.Fone to fix this kind of issues. A simple tutorial can be found out in here.   <answer295192> Try holding the home button and the power button for 10 seconds.  If it worked, the Apple logo will appear, then it should turn on.  <comment335005> Have you tried turning it on? Does your computer recognise the iPhone? <comment335006> Yeah, i tried it but it did not worked...same the apple logo is displayed is on & off only. <comment335007> So, your computer doesn't recognise iPhone when it's on (connected via USB)? <comment335009> Yes... :(  How can i retrieve my photos & contact list?? I had not connect it to i-cloud too :( <comment335013> If it won't boot & you have no backup, then your only hope is that a repairer can fix it without needing to restore it. Otherwise, your data's gone.
