Mount disk via Automator â€“ wrong charset <body> I use Automator to mount external disk. The disk is mounted successfully, but I am not able to open some files. I tried the same process on my Ubuntu system and I have found out that the reason is wrong encoding for mounted disk. If I set iocharset=utf8 in mount on Ubuntu, everything is OK. But I cannot open files when I use iocharset=cp1250. Is there any possibility to set encoding when I use Automator to mount this disk?
