Profile Manager: Enroll gives a error 500 <body> I'm new to iOS and I'm trying to configure a server to use it as a MDM solution via Profile Manager.  So far I have:  ul liConfigured my OS X Server./li liAdded a signed SSL certificate./li liSent some invitations to end users./li /ul  BUT when the user reaches the stronghttps://mock_domain/mydevices//strong and tries to enroll it (does a POST to stronghttps://mock_domain/devicemanagement/mdm/mdm_enroll) returns a **error 500/strong.  After checking the strongerror_log/strong it looks like there is some security issues (probably related to the SSL certificate):  emAH01630: client denied by server configuration/em  I dont know exactly what is happening but might be related to the SSL certificate.  My OpenDirectory service is configured with a self-signed certificate and the rest of services are configured to use the certificate that I bought.  I have tried to change the certificate of the OpenDirectory to explore that path but I can't and I dont know if it is really related to the error 500 issue.  Any advice??  <answer231365> Bit late to the party, but it seems to be resolved through opening Server, turning Off open directory, waiting a few seconds, then turning it back On. Repeat if necessary.  This has happened twice in the past month, both times were resolved by doing this. I'm now searching as to why this occurs, and if it happens again I'll test reinstalling the Server App.  Hopefully this helps someone.  <comment227913> The messages is : The character encoding of the HTML document was not declared.
