How to raise verbosity of Installer.app? <body> I'm having troubles with the system installer (code/System/Library/CoreServices/Installer.app/code) where certain things are not installing and are not providing sufficient details in code/var/log/install.log/code.  I get the dreaded "The installation failed" error: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/l38bt.png" alt="The installation failed"  Without sufficient details within the log as noted above.  Is there a way to raise verbosity so as to ascertain precisely where it may be failing within the install process?  I have been hoping that there is a flag that can be executed to increase this verbosity, but I've not found anything for   precode/System/Library/CoreServices/Installer.app/Contents/MacOS/Installer  /code/pre  as of yet when executing it from the shell...  <answer258398> You can use the command line codeinstaller/code (in code/usr/sbin/installer/code).  From the man page:     The installer command is used to install Mac OS X installer packages to a specified domain or volume.   and use the code-verbose/code or code-verboseR/code options.  By example :  precodeinstaller -verbose -pkg DeveloperTools.mpkg -target / /code/pre  <answer258403> If it's on macOS 10.12 you can use the new codelog stream/code command together with code--predicate/code flag to narrow down the issues. Please note that log gives you a lot more output then syslog does/can.   codelog stream --predicate examples:     --predicate 'eventMessage contains "my message"'     --predicate 'eventType == logEvent and messageType == info'     --predicate 'processImagePath endswith "d"'     --predicate 'not processImagePath contains[c] "some spammer"'     --predicate 'processID &lt; 100'     --predicate 'senderImagePath beginswith "my sender"'     --predicate 'eventType == logEvent and subsystem contains "com.example.my_subsystem"'/code  You can also add code--level=debug/code to get the maximum verbosity from log, and then narrow down the Installer.app issues with code--predicate/code
