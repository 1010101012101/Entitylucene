Problem with Non English(Farsi, ...) subtitle <body> When I want see movie or video in mac os x (with VLC, DivX Player, Quick Time) and want to load subtitle these video player application can't load my subtitle correctly and show in strange text.  my subtitle languages is Farsi (rtl language). I think I must change some unicode settings but I don't know where anyone have any idea?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IQpHG.jpg" alt="alt text"  <answer1022> It could be (and looks like) a possible issue regrading encoding. It's probably not UTF-8, and something different.  That being said, if VLC can't play it nothing can. I suggest trying to find different subtitles.  <answer1198> Try with MplayerX which features:     ul   liAuto detect the encode method of subtitle file (with Universal Charset Detector)   ul   liNow could support multiple sub files with different encode method/li   liLoad subtitles while playing - just drag or double-click it/li   liLetterbox for the subtitles/li   /ul/li   /ul   <answer2559> According to Trezoid answer on superuser the solution is:    By default the language encoding on strongVLC/strong (and possibly others) is set to "default" which is codewindows-1252/code (possibly only if your language is set to english, but I'm not sure)  This will not display other languages very well. To fix it, open up strongVLC/strong preferences, click on the Subtitles and OSD tab, and change "default encoding" to codeUTF-8/code  This will give the program a much wider choice of characters to display from allowing it to render the characters as they should be.  <answer232563> for solving this problem use this link and follow the instruction from my blog.

I can watch this subtitle in vlc in my windows I just have problem in my os x. <comment2122> I turn off MplayerX auto encoding recognition and test as many as encoding that I think was related but still can't see them correct. <comment2125> Are you sure that the content is correctly encoded? Try to open the subtitle file with TextWrangler, it should display the charset in the status bar. At this point you can even save in UTF-8 and whatnot. <comment286038> Please provide the solution instead of linking to an external website.
