VLC issues on macbook and photos app on OSX El Capitan <body> I have a problem with Vlc player on my macbook pro, it keeps 'not responding' every time I tried to play a video. The weird thing is also my photo app doesnt show anything when I open the app.  It's happened everytime I restart my mac. These two apps always like this.  My mac is running el cap. Please help  Thank you  <comment256668> Does it work if you go into Finder, select the file, "right-click", and choose Open with VLC? I find if I have VLC open, and use its file menu to run a video, I only get audio, no video, and the video options are greyed out. Opening from Finder, I also get proper video. Is it just me? or some quirk of the VLC interface? <comment256672> For me it's just not responding at all. I have this problem for awhile now, I just keep restarting my mac till it works. It's so annoying.
