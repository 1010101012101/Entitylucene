SD Cards "forgets" written data <body> I have an SD Card I bought from ebay. It works, sort of. Recently, it somehow acquired the weird habit of "forgetting" things I copy to it. For example;  ol liI would normally place my music folder to the left taking half of the screen, and the window with the sd card to the right taking the rest of screen./li liI would then copy a folder to the sd card/li liemsafely remove/em the sd card (or not, tried it both ways)/li liPull it out/li liPlace it into my phone (or back into the mac)/li liCan't find the copied folder, like I've never copied it./li /ol  This is weird, and only happens sometimes. I think it happens more when I pull out the card up to 5 minutes after I copied something.  Is this a cache problem? What's the course of action to find the root of this?  <answer181958> It sounds like that SD card has a faulty controller chip. From your description, I'm guessing that you bought it second-hand through ebay, so you might have been "burned" there.  Something you can try is to open strongDisk Utility/strong, choose the SD card, and then click strongVerify Disk/strong.  Something else you can try (crossing fingers) is to reformat the SD card and hope for the best. However, if the SD card is acting flakey, then it might be best to scrap it for a new one.  Question: In strongDisk Utility/strong, select the SD card and choose strongInfo/strong. What strongFile System/strong is the card formatted for?
