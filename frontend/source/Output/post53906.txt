iCloud streaming <body> I have an Apple TV and it works great. I can stream my movies and TV shows from the cloud and watch them on my TV.  I also have a MacBook Air, with a small HD. How can I stream my movies and TV shows from the cloud and watch them on my MacBook Air when I'm out of town? Download to watch isn't a good fit because of limited HD space.  <answer53908> No. iCloud does not have movie streaming for Macs (yet). Although I would suggest Hulu or Netflix instead, it may be more costly.
