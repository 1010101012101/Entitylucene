How to change Default alert sound in iCal? <body> I would like to change the default sound ("basso") that plays when an Alert is fired from iCal in the notification center?  I have tried changing the sounds in notification center, but it seems to be overridden by the iCal settings. Can the sound be changed to "glass" or any other?   One way, I can do it is by changing the Alert sound when I create a Calendar Event. This is just too cumbersome to do everytime.   Please assist.  <answer154788> There is a alternative way to do that.  Go to System/Library/Sounds and create a sound file with the same name as Basso.aiff and it will supersede Basso without the need for deleting a system sound file.  <answer180306> strongI hate the basso sound./strong I prefer not to have any sound on my alerts, except on rare occasions.  I went to the command line and did 'touch Basso.aiff'. That creates a zero kb file that you can copy to /System/Library/Sounds/  I do wish however, that there were a way to set the alarm default to "no sound". That would be the correct way to solve my problem.  <answer181272> Make a .aiff file containing silence  <comment215555> That doesn't really answer the question, though it does answer part of it.
