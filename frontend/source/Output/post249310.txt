iTunes playlists won't sort by Name anymore <body> I have recently had to upgrade to Windows 10, and with the 2 subsequent downloads of iTunes, I can no longer sort playlists by Name (Song title), which is what I prefer on my iPods. They USED to sort like the Songs list does (just click on Name and voila). Now I get fancy, multi-coloured lists I can't read or manipulate in any way. Not user-friendly at all. Help!  If I hadn't just had to completely re-create all playlists; all ratings, and reinstall all music into iTunes with the change, I'd be a lot more patient, but this is already a 6-month project to get back to where I was before.   <answer249333> The layout will be different on Windows, as the menus are inside the app itself [accessed by pressing kbd Alt /kbd if not already visible] but the method is the same...  View Menu  View As  Songsbr Then you can click any column header to sort on that column [current sort on Title highlighted with the red square].  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vRM6A.png" alt="enter image description here"
