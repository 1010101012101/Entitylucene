Some images aren't displayed in Safari Mobile but are when using HTTPS <body> My website contains some user pictures that weighs about 70kb.       Using Safari strongon Iphone 6/strong, there're some images that aren't displayed (blank content) in HTTP strongbut are in HTTPS/strong.  It well works using an iPhone 4S with simple HTTP.  I don't figure out the reason, any idea?  <comment215084> Interesting related discussion: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6563683   = Safari bug on Iphone 6 ?!
