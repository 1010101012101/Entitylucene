will RAM from a mid-2011 MacBook Pro work in an early 2011 iMac? <body> Will RAM from a mid-2011 MBP work in an early 2011 iMac (and vice-versa)? Both are listed as 1333 MHz PC3-10600 DDR3.   I have 16 GB (2x8GB) in the MacBook Pro, and 12 GB (2x4GB + 2x8GB) in the iMac.  I want to swap the MacBook Pro's RAM with the 2x4B set in the iMac.  <answer168436> The memory for the MacBook Pro 8,1; 8,2 and 8,3 is the same as for the iMac 12,1 and 12,2.  Just as a point of clarity, the models possible are:  Early 2011 MacBook Pro Late 2011 MacBook Pro  Mid 2011 iMac Late 2011 iMac  <comment200392> I also have a Mac Mini (mid 2011, 2.3Ghz i5) from the same era. Also compatible? <comment200729> The Mid 2011 Macmini5,2 features 2 - 204-pin PC-10600 (1333 MHz) DDR3 SO-DIMM. While Apple officially states max. 8GB, it can actually happily support 16GB. If you fully populate it with max memory, you'll likely notice quite a nice improvement in performance.  Also, for all the information you could want on pretty much any Apple product, check out Mactracker from the App Store. it's available on both OS X and iOS. Free. Excellent app.
