Mac mode where you can see code on startup <body> In emThe Outliers/em, Bill Joy is quoted as saying      "If you put your Mac in that funny mode where you can see the code, I   see things that I can remember typing 25 years ago."   I'm intrigued - what is this mode? How does one use it?  <answer201644> There's no such thing (from the user point-of-view). Mac OS X is not an open-source operating system.  <answer201661> More than likely, He is talking about single user mode. Single user mode is a state of the operating system used to repair functionality of the operating system.  <answer201704> Single user or Verbose mode.   h2Verbose mode start up/h2  ul liRestart the Mac/li liImmediately hold down the command + V keys/li /ul  You have successfully entered verbose mode when you see white text appear on the screen.   See Apple Support   <comment243101> Must have been a developer tool, then? <comment243103> If you're a developer and you work in Cupertino, sure! <comment243109> What Mac? What OS? It might be [MacsBug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacsBug) and the programmer switch on the old 68000 original Mac line, but it's hard to tell without more clarity. <comment243111> @2xedo Unix is the Mac OS "core". And it is Linux's too. If you're interested in seeing what a Unix code might looks like, you can do it through Linux: in Linux you can download (and eventually edit and publish your own distro) the source code <comment243130> Coding was done on the black screen which still exists under all that GUI.  You can see that it starting up in Verbose Mode - which is also the way to get out of  kernel panic. Hold down Comm-V. <comment243131> Or is it referring to Terminal? Lol. <comment243132> @Zo219 Yes, either verbose or single user mode. The output seems as if it is the "code". Enough speculating. <comment243167> I think this is what was being referred to. Thanks!
