What is the read speed of the SSD in the Macbook Air A1466 model? <body> I'm having trouble finding a figure or proper specs on Google, and I was wondering how fast it is.  Anyone know?  <answer128263> According to this article, it's over 700MB/s.   <answer128268> That depends on our exact model so look it up here.  It can be as high as 6 Gb/s.  <comment150242> So then would one of the USB ports be a bottleneck in transferring things off the drive via USB?
