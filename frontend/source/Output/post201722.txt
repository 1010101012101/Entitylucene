Screen Not Working and Lock Button Stuck <body> The screen has broken on my iPhone 4S and the On/Off button does not work. I had an idea that it might fix if I restart it (tell me if I'm wrong) but I can't. Is there a way that I can restart or even better update it from iTunes on the MacBook? I do know how to back it up.   <answer203151> strongMethod 1:/strong Reboot iPhone by setting "Bold Text"  ol liOpen the Settings app and head to “General”/li liGo to “Accessibility” and locate “Bold Text”, flip that to the ON position/li liAn alert will show up saying “Applying this setting with restart your iPhone” – so tap on “Continue” to immediately soft reboot device/li /ol  strongMethod 2:/strong Restart the iPhone By Resetting Networking Settings  ol liHead to Settings app and go to “General” and then to “Reset”/li liLocate “Reset Network Settings” and select it, then tap to confirm and reboot your phone./li /ol  If the issue is still not solved you'd better to call Apple or have someone check for you. Or you can check hcqs.cc for replacement parts and repair it yourself.  <comment243199> You need the screen to login before you can back it up & you need the top button to be able to force it into DFU mode if it won't behave... so you're going to have to get one or the other fixed. <comment246592> Probably I suggest you to go to the nearest machine store there.. They may help you with the button that gets stucked.
