Auto sync local files to remote <body> Are there any OSX tools that can watch for file changes in a directory then sync (SFTP) those changes to a remote server?  Basically I want to edit files locally (whatever files, whatever program) and have them automatically upload to the server.  Rsync can't watch a directory for changes on it's own, and I can't seem to get lyncd to run on osx, due to no inotify tool.  Any ideas?  <answer21558> I'm only aware of proprietary systems like DropBox.  But it seems like this could be done fairly easily, using kqueue to detect file changes, and running rsync a few seconds later.  <answer21560> If you are happy writing a script, Folder Actions let you achieve  what you require:  http://www.simplehelp.net/2007/01/30/folder-actions-for-os-x-explained-with-real-world-examples/  The following page seems to offer exactly the solution you are looking for:  http://sites.google.com/site/andreatagliasacchi/blog/osxautomaticsyncwithfolderactions  <answer21574> Here's an article about doing just that with a Ruby script.  It uses emFSEvent/em, the eminotify/em counterpart on Mac OS X.  <answer21575> RE : "..

You're in luck, DoubleDown will do exactly what you specified :  Direct Download for DoubleDown here.  DoubleDown download page with more info here.  More info on DoubleDown :     Doubledown keeps a complete local copy of the remote directory you're   syncing so all your local operations are lightning fast. After it   performs an initial sync (being careful not to clobber any local   changes), Doubledown is notified of changes by Mac OS X's FSEvents   framework and responds by creating, uploading, and removing files or   directories as required.   Hope this helps.  <answer245068> Use codeentr/code command-line tool to watch for file changes in a directory. It has special code-d/code option to react to events when a new file is added to a directory. The implication is that if a new file appears it must exit to allow an external shell loop to rescan the file system, so when code-d/code is used, you've to use it with a loop. For example (to check for changes in codepath//code directory):  precode$ while true; do &gt; find path/ | entr -d sh -c 'rsync -vuar path/ example.com:. &amp;&amp; echo Updated' &gt; done /code/pre  Installation via Brew: codebrew install entr/code.  <comment23688> Perhaps belongs on SU? <comment23694> I disagree - I think this is an OS X question and belongs here.
