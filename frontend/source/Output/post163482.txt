Or please tell me how i sync my village on my iPad to my new Game Center account  <answer163501> If you have a device with your old Apple ID already on it, just go to the App Store and download a random app. Then, take that email, and use it as your Game Center email. If you forgot the password, hit the aptly named "Forgot Password" button. If you really need to use your new Apple ID, just sign in.  <comment191473> This question appears to be off-topic because it is about CoC. <comment191477> @Buscarì›ƒ yea. I though there was a duplicate about this, but I couldn't find one. <comment191479> Sorry, we do not support CoC questions.
