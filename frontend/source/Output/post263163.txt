Finder drag and drop file issue (snap to grid) <body> I'm having issues with my Finder in that when moving files to another folder by dragging the file and dropping it onto a directory in the sidebar, it doesn't move the newly moved file to the very end of the folder. Here's a few screenshots showing the issue: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QjT3M.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/W5Wh9.png" alt="enter image description here"  As you can see in the last image, the file sig.html is right on top of a folder. Also, just to be clear, the Documents folder has more than 10 things in it and this file happen to be moved to 4th row, 1st column (my folders have 5 columns).  This does not happen in the root folder and a few other places. I've tried Automator to set view options, I've manually deleted .DS_Stores, finder.plist, and resetting the view options and then clicked 'Use as Defaults', but none fixed this issue.  Not sure if it's relevant or not, but I upgraded from Mavericks straight to Sierra.  I'd appreciate any help to fix this.
