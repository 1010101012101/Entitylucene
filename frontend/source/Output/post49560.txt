Enabling Personal Hotspot feature <body> My current carrier does not allow the Personal Hotspot feature for iPhone 4 so this option is missing in the menu. Is there a way I can enable this? I don't mind jailbreaking it. I don't want to use MiWi or any aditional application. I want to use the native one. Thanks  <answer49580> Tetherme is an app you can purchase and install on a jailbroken device that will attempt to enable the iOS personal hotspot feature on devices and with carriers that don't support it.  Reports are mixed, some user indicating it doesn't work with their particular configuration, others reporting that some carriers detect this usage and disconnect when the personal hotspot is active.  While you are interested in using the iOS personal hotspot, chances are good that the more reliable method is to use a third party utility.  However, if you must use the iOS personal hotspot feature, tetherme seems to be only available option right now.  <answer49612> To enable tethering (aka Personal Hotspot) you need to load a modified "carrier file", to do that you'll need what's known as the "Wortel Commcenter Patch."  ol liJailbreak/li liInstall the Commcenter Patch through Cydia from this repo/li liReboot/li liEdit your carrier.plist according to these instructions :/li /ol     ol   librowse to /System/Library/Carrier Bundes/your_carrier.bundle//li   liDownload your carrier.plist file from your iPhone and save a copy of this original file, just in case./li   liOpen the downloaded carrier.plist in your favorite text editor/li   liUnder APNS-APN look for something with your carriers WAP settings. Change the type mask integer from 4 to 53 - which should   change allowing MMS to MMS, data and tethering. A explanation of these   numbers is here.

It's a dark art and caution is advised.  <comment56730> Which carrier would that be? <comment56741> Movistar in Peru <comment56761> Ooh. A non-standard carrier... <comment56762> If possible, can you add a link please? <comment56763> @daviesgeek Done. <comment56764> Awesome! Thanks! <comment56785> What iOS version are you on ? <comment56794> Great answer, Adam. <comment57115> I'm on iOS 5.1, the last one.
