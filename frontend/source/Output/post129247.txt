Refresh OSX to get rid of stuck info tag <body> Every now and then I get an info tag stuck on my screen on top of all my applications. The only think I know that will remove it is restarting my computer. Is there an easier way to refresh OSX that would get rid it?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9JcJ9.png" alt="Stuck info tag in OSX Mavericks"  I'm running the latest OSX Mavericks. I tried creating a new desktop deleting the main desktop. The problem persists unto the new desktop.  The tag does go away temporarily when I slide over to the dashboard and when I show the desktop but comes right back when I return to my applications.  <answer155256> Turns out this is a common problem.  One of the following should get rid of the tooltip:    ul liHover over another element with a tooltip in the same app that generated the stuck tooltip, as explained here/li liClose the app which you think generated the tooltip/li liLog out of OSX and log back in/li /ul
