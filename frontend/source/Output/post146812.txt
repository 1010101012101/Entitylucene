Now I want add a voice over.  Can I do that and if so how?  <answer146813> Go to strongPlay/strong → strongRecord Slideshow/strong and click the strongRecord/strong button at the bottom to begin.        img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FcLlS.png" width="575"  <answer249025> You could also use QuickTime Player to record the audio separately, in case you want to edit it, add pauses, etc. QTP is actually a pretty versatile tool; it can do screencasting and general recording but most people don't even know it's there.
