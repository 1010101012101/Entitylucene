How do I make symbolic links invisible in the Finder? <body> I use codeSetFile/code via the terminal to render files and folders invisible inside Finder windows. This does not appear to work on symbolic links: the symlink destination is made invisible, rather than the symlink itself.  I see a number of symlinks in code//code which are invisible in the Finder (e.g. code/etc -&gt; private/etc/code), so it seems to be possible. Can I duplicate this behavior?  <answer24306> To hide:  precodechflags -h hidden &lt;symlink&gt; /code/pre  To show again:  precodechflags -h nohidden &lt;symlink&gt; /code/pre  <answer24308> Reading fail.  precode-P                                # perform action on symlink instead of following it /code/pre  This flag has strange indenting in codeSetFile -h/code, and I must have just ignored it assuming it was related to the code-m/code date flag.  So,  precodeSetFile -P -a V my_symlink /code/pre  <answer24309> If you use codeln -s source_file target_file/code from a terminal you'll get e.g. code/etc -&gt; private/etc/code shown in the codels -la/code - but only shown the target_file in the folder.  <comment27218> I got your flag, but it is okay to answer your own question if you find the answer yourself. Just be sure to check the other answers to make sure there isn't one better than your own. No worries. <comment105435> Note that the -h option was only added in Lion. I prefer using chflags, since SetFile only comes with Developer Tools. <comment373534> -h      If the file is a symbolic link, change the mode of the link       itself rather than the file to which it points.
