Bluetooth keyboard keeps trying to pair but fails to <body> I have a wireless bluetooth keyboard and a Macbook Pro with OS X Yosemite 10.10.4. Whenever I press the power button, it requests to pair with the macbook, popping up the window with the code for me to enter. However, I'm unable to enter the code with the keyboard. Pressing the power button again just fires off more pairing requests. Holding the power button to turn off the keyboard and turning it back on again doesn't seem to fix this issue. What can I do to get my keyboard to pair successfully?  <comment240387> Does the keyboard pair with other Macs? And does the MacBook pair with other keyboards? <comment240389> Yes and yes, and I've gotten this problem with multiple keyboards on multiple macs.
