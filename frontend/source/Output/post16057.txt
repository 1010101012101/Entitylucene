Do Macbooks with protective cases fit into the BookArc Desktop Stand? <body> I have a 15" Macbook Pro in a Speck protective case.   Will this fit into a Twelve South BookArc Desktop Stand for Notebooks comfortably? The protective case adds a little to the body of the Macbook, my concern is that it won't fit.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7rk83.jpg" alt="Speck case for Macbook"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BQJIB.jpg" alt="Twelve South BookArc Desktop Stand for Notebooks"  <answer16069> It works great with the Speck case, just go up an insert size and you're good.
