Where's the # key in Lion <body> In Snow Leopard alt-3 used to print a #, in Lion it doesn't.  I'v tried different key combination keyboard viewer but still no luck. Any ideas were the # key went?  <answer21461> You're talking about the hash key? Doesn't it print when you press Shift+3 ? Or maybe your keyboard layout is different but on every keyboard I've seen in the United States that's where the hash key lives.  <answer21464> It's still Alt-3 on my UK keyboard -- ###.  <answer21466> Since it varies by keyboard layout - why not open your keyboard viewer and find out?  In the US keyboard layout on lion, it's still kbdshift/kbd + kbd3/kbd  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qHiQZ.png" alt="enter image description here"  You have to select this from the menu bar after enabling it in the menu bar  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VkKQl.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer34153> I like to use the widget:  h2CharacterPal/h2  Searching and copying a needed character is faster than with the keyboard viewer:  ul liYou do can look through all characers at once. With the keyboard viewer you need to hold kbd&#x2325;/kbd and kbd&#x21E7;/kbd to see more characters. /li liCharacters are sorteded by type: greek, keyboard, math.../li listrongTOP/strong: You can find special (keyboard) symbols like kbd&#x2326;/kbd, kbd&#x2318;/kbd, kbd&#x238B;/kbd, kbd&#x23CF;/kbd, kbd&#x2324;/kbd .../li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XgttD.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VMwKX.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer228615> on a french keyboard # is: alt-shift-£  crazy huh?   <comment23556> It depends heavily on the localization you set - what layout are you using? (It is selected when you first customize your OS and can be changed in the **Language & Text** system preference under _Input Sources_ ) <comment23557> Perhaps the questioner isn't in the United States? Apple keyboards in the UK have no hash symbol marked on them at all, but you can get hash with Alt-3 (in Lion as well as Snow Leopard). Similarly, the Euro symbol € is Alt-2, which *is* marked on the keyboard, and Alt-1 and Alt-4 through Alt-0 also produce different unmarked characters. <comment23559> The post author did mention trying keyboard viewer.  But perhaps did not hit shift or alt+shift? <comment23561> Any chance you're on a UK keyboard? Or UK keyboard setting at least? If so, try `Alt+3`... <comment23562> I have my Input Source configured to U.S. <comment23563> apparently uk keyboard has alt-3 as # & shift 3 as £; the U.S. keyboard is vice versa <comment23566> It's Shift-3 even tough I have the £ sign on my 3 . <comment23567> More likely the input source was changer on her. <comment23574> ¡™£¢∞§¶•ªº–≠ alt is fun ⁄€‹›ﬁﬂ‡°·‚—± how much comes out when non-Macs view this web page? <comment23615> I can see all of that from the windows computer I use for work. Why? <comment38965> this is correct, alt-3 for # on UK keyboard
