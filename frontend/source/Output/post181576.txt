iOS - Lower volume before playing video <body> Sometimes I want to play a video but I'm in a meeting or a place where I can't afford to wait for the video to start to then quickly press the volume buttons to make it softer.  Is there any way I can mute the audio for a video before playing it? It seems like a valid scenario.  <answer264919> You can lower volume without playing the video.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/z5rRgm.jpg" alt="ios control center"  from another answer:     The control center works (swipe up from bottom of screen and slide volume slider as desired).       In iOS 9 at least, you can also go Settings - Sounds and under the Ringer and Alerts section, turn off "Change with Buttons", then use the volume buttons on the side of the phone to adjust the media volume. You can leave this option off to always have media volume control with the hardware buttons if you are OK with the ringer volume being just off or on at a preset level using the silent toggle switch on the side of the phone.   <comment215943> have headset ready to plug them in :) <comment216111> Is this the only way? It feels wrong not to let the user mute his phone unless it first starts loudly <comment216118> what happened to your volume button  on the ipad? <comment216372> Change the setting for the volume buttons to make them affect system sound, not ringtones. Settings app  Sounds  "Ringers and Alerts" section  turn off Change with Buttons. Or just use the Silence button on the side of the device.
