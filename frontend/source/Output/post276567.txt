How to restore my Mac Safari bookmarks and history after iCloud sync? <body> I have various Safari bookmarks on my iPhone. I got a new Mac laptop, and when I enabled iCloud on the Mac, all the bookmarks and history from my iPhone were copied over to my Mac. I did strongNOT/strong want that.  How do I restore the bookmarks and the history that I formerly had on my Mac?  I am using iOS 10 and Mac OS 10.12 (Sierra).  <comment348260> Is it possible they were merged? http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/21476/how-do-i-get-safari-macs-bookmarks-to-overwrite-safari-ios-bookmarks  Also, if it was a new Mac, did you have any bookmarks on it? *Are you really asking how to keep your Mac and iOS bookmarks separate?* <comment348292> @studiohack: Yes, I did have some new bookmarks and favorites on my new Mac. How do I recover them?
