"Bookmarks are being synced..." message in Safari <body> What causes the iPad to show     Bookmarks are being synced. Please add the bookmarks once syncing has completed   when attempting to add a bookmark or favorite in Safari and how can it be prevented?  <answer231446> It's part of iCloud! You can either turn off iCloud bookmark sync   or   I am not sure it can be done for individual bookmarks, I believe it is a system wide setting.
