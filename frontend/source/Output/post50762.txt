How to Auto-Hide the Address Bar in Google Chrome? <body> How can I hide the address bar in google chrome?  I found this article but I am unable to find a solutions for Mac OS.  Ideally I would like all tool bars to disappear similar to how they do in Quicktime. see images: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lGWcM.png" alt="With tool bar showing" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lZn4F.png" alt="Hidden tool bar"  Is there such a solutions available?   <answer50797> I'm not entirely sure I understand what you're asking, but I think you mean in full screen mode judging by the tags.  Simply uncheck strongView  Always Show Toolbar in Full Screen/strong (kbd⇧⌘F/kbd):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rkjJy.png" width="530"  <answer143089> To get full screen w/o address bar in Chrome on OSX use kbdCmd-Shift-F/kbd  <answer191170> As in other answers to this question, the best option I could find is by running chrome from a shell and passing in the --app (which runs google chrome in application mode or something of the sort) option as follows:  precode/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --app="http://www.google.com" /code/pre  <answer209415> You cannot disable 100% the address bar in any browser anymore.  To do that, you need to recompile the sources of Chromium, Firefox etc. with the necessary changes.  This rule of mandatory address bar has been accepted because of scams and other critical issues caused by people that create fake evil things.  <comment58207> This does not answer my question, I looking for how to fill the entire content of a chrome window with html content without the necessity to be in full screen mode. <comment58208> You should ask for clarification in a comment what a question is asking before answering if you are not sure. <comment58237> @rudolph9 To be fair, there *was* a full screen tag. <comment58238> So you can see how there might be a vague possibility I'd think you were talking about being in full screen mode. <comment58244> If you do **not** fully understand what a question is asking you should **not** submit an answer. <comment60744> Btw, the article that you found is out of date.  Apparently Google did not like the way that experimental feature was turning out and disabled it.  :(  I have yet to find a way to do it either. <comment71291> Did either of you find a way to solve this yet? I'm still using an ancient version of Chrome (~12.x), which is starting to break with all this new-fangled HTML5 stuff around. <comment83127> @bassplayer7 will do, I have been neglecting the OSX stackexchange a bit. <comment83282> Good. It benefits you and the answerer - the answerer not just with rep but also tags, I believe. <comment83330> So maybe some way to emulate fullscreen mode without actually going into fullscreen? <comment83541> Out of curiosity: why do you want such a solution? <comment83557> I love full screen mode apps, especally full-screen chrome not having to look at an address bar, however I don't like being limited to one app per window... eventually I would like to be able to navigate between my browser windows the same way I navigate between windows in vim, and I this as an effective way of accomplishing this. <comment83763> @rudolph9: No worries, on the 0%. Thank you for taking the time to make sure. I appreciate the effort to keep SE a good resource. <comment111496> +1. While it did not answer OP's question, it did answer what I was looking for! <comment168550> This does not answer the question.  Please read more carefully. <comment236360> Well, I found this answer useful when Googling this precise issue!
