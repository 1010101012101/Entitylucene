Messages applescript not working under Mountain Lion? <body> Tried adding an AppleScript to run a specific command when I'm sending or receiving a message in Messages on my server, but for some reason it never seems to get called.  Placed it first in code~/Library/Scripts/Applications/Messages/code, and then in code~/Library/Application Scripts/Messages/code, but it doesn't seem to work in either. It appears at the bottom of the AppleScript menu when I have Messages front though.  Here's the test script:  precodeusing terms from application "Messages"     on message sent theMessage for theChat         display dialog "Triggered on message sent"     end message sent     on message received theMessage from theBuddy for theChat         display dialog "Triggered on message received"     end message received end using terms from /code/pre  Any idea why neither of these fire?  <answer96317> I believe that the Applescripts need to be called in Preferences  Alerts. Select an event and then select "Run an Applescript Script:"  See if that helps.  <comment113123> That worked perfectly! So is this how it always worked with Messages (that it didn't trigger these scripts by default), or did something change with Mountain Lion? <comment113130> As far as I can recall it has always worked this way, but I can't recall very far.
