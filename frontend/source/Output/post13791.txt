Converting HTML to PDF using convert utility in Mac OS X <body> I'm trying to convert a bunch of HTML files into PDF files. I'm looking for an automated solution so that i don't have to open each HTML file individually and convert it to PDF. In Mac OSX, codeconvert/code utility can be used to convert HTML files to PDF. I'm facing two problems.   ol licodeconvert/code utility is not applying CSS style to generated PDF content./li liMy AppleScript for batch convert is not working./li /ol  Here's my AppleScript:  precodeon open input_documents     repeat with this_document in input_documents          if this_document is not document file then             set this_document_path to POSIX path of this_document             do shell script "/System/Library/Printers/Libraries/convert -f " &amp; quoted form of this_document_path &amp; " -o " &amp; quoted form of this_document_path &amp; ".pdf"         end if     end repeat end open /code/pre  I use this script to create a .app and then drag the documents folder onto the generated .app file. Note that all images associated with images are placed in a subdirectory/subfolder. My document structure looks like this:  precode/HTML /HTML/Images/ /HTML/a.html /HTML/b.html /code/pre  Any suggestions?  <answer13792> Have a look at wkhtmltopdfâ€” a command-line utility that uses the WebKit rendering engine to produce PDFs from HTML. I've found that it produces a nicer result. You shouldn't have any trouble integrating it with your current script.  <answer13793> Have you considered writing an AppleScript script to open each HTML file in a scriptable web browser (like Safari) and then using the browser's standard print command to print to a PDF file?    <comment14657> Have you looked into the `textutil` command? It also supports HTML. <comment14680> @Mustafa You should avoid cross-posting -- ask a moderator to migrate it for you. <comment14681> I believe stackoverflow has more visibility than stackexchange. Duplicate won't hurt, it might just work for me. <comment14682> Just ran `./wkhtmltopdf *.html *.pdf` and it worked great, with an exception. It produced "*.pdf" file instead of separate files for each html. Do you know if this utility has the support to generate separate files? Thanks much. <comment14683> Hi Mustafa, try something like (in a directory of HTML files) `for f in *.html; do wkhtmltopdf $f "$f.pdf"; done` to loop through the files in a directory. <comment14684> With a little modification e.g. `for f in *.html; do ./wkhtmltopdf "$f" "$f.pdf"`, it works beautifully. Thanks much. <comment14685> Hm, i'm not that good with AppleScript :) In fact, i've recently only done Hello World like stuff in AppleScript. <comment16804> @mankoff, I did. It doesn't support the conversion of html files to pdf. It supports: txt, html, rtf, rtfd, doc, docx, wordml, odt, or webarchive <comment94131> Chrome's print screen command on certain sites (this site for example) does not produce an exact replica of the html on the site. So the more accurate wkhtmltopdf solution might be necessary, depending on needs.
