'which openssl' returns nothing when trying to upgrade OpenSSL <body> I've been working the last day or so to get openssl upgraded on my machine. I've followed the answers here and here and now I've got some pretty funny results.  When I type codewhich openssl/code I get no response.br When I type codeopenssl version/code I get code-bash: openssl: command not found/codebr When I type codebrew install openssl/code I get codeWarning: openssl-1.0.1g already installed./code  Why does brew recognize an installation, but my other terminal commands suggest that nothing is installed? What do I need to do to get my system to recognize the installation that brew is seeing, or what do I need to remove to allow me to do a fresh install of openssl?  Edit: 'brew doctor' gives me the following:     Warning: Your XQuartz (2.7.4) is outdated   Please install XQuartz 2.7.5:    https://xquartz.macosforge.org      Warning: Python is installed at /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework      Homebrew only supports building against the System-provided Python or a   brewed Python. In particular, Pythons installed to /Library can interfere   with other software installs.   <answer127263> This command should show you where any openssl binaries may be located on your system:  codelocate openssl | grep bin/openssl/code  For homebrew, make sure you have /usr/local/bin and /usr/local/sbin in your $PATH. You can check your current path setting by issuing codeecho $PATH/code.  <answer127314> It looks like openssl was installed in /usr/local/Cellar/openssl/1.0.1g/bin/openssl and needed to be symlinked to the desired location. The following command accomplished that for me:  ln -s /usr/local/Cellar/openssl/1.0.1g/bin/openssl /usr/local/bin  After that command was run, 'which openssl' returned "/usr/local/bin/openssl" and 'openssl version' returned "OpenSSL 1.0.1g 7 Apr 2014"  <comment149105> What does `brew doctor` give? <comment149115> Post edited to include what is provided by the 'brew doctor' command. <comment149145> When I run locate I get a warning about the locate database not being created. <comment149151> ah, then you can run:  `sudo /usr/libexec/locate.updatedb`  that will run a complete filesystem sweep of your system and store all information about files and directories in a locate database. You can then run the `locate` command after it has run to find the openssl files. <comment149152> There are of course other ways to achieve the same thing. Another is to use spotlight's terminal command:   `mdfind 'kMDItemFSName=openssl&&kMDItemContentType=public.unix-executable'`
