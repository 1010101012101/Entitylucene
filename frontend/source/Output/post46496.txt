Can't see drafts folder in Mac Mail <body> I have a recent MacBook Pro that was running OS X 10.6 but was recently updated to 10.7. My work email switched from Gmail to Exchange and they said to use the built-in Mail app. Overall, I like it, but I can't figure out how to see my drafts folder. According to the help, it only shows up if I have something in it, but I tried composing a message and saving it, and I still don't see my drafts folder in my list of folders. What am I supposed to do about this?  <answer46510> This is a setting in Mail preferences. Go to Preferences  Accounts  (account)  Mailbox Behaviors and enable Drafts. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NxLVw.png" alt="preferences"  If that doesn't work, show the Favorites Bar (View  Show Favorites Bar) and Drafts should be an option. Click it. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kkJth.png" alt="favorites bar"  <answer46511> I just tried it with an Exchange account in Mail app with Mac OS 10.7.3. I got this when I save the message :  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qI6hX.png" alt="Saving message" Then I find it in the Draft folder (which were not here before) :  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cYcm4.png" alt="Draft folder appears"  Did you try to quit Mail after you saved your message then reopen again ? Check that you have this option enabled in your account preferences too :   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0Fi8l.png" alt="enter image description here"  Otherwise it could be an Exchange issue.  Hope this helps !  <answer46516> I fixed this issue by restarting Mail. I have no idea why the drafts folder wasn't showing up before.  <answer155888> Same deal - I had the same issue then resolved by creating a new message, closing the message out, then saving it as a Draft. Magically my draft folder appeared. Problem solved. Not a great user experience though!  <answer166315> Right Click - Get Account Info-Drafts-Show Messages   You will be able to see drafts folder thereafter .  Cheers!!!
