Macbook pro13 (2015) Battery dropping significantly during sleep <body> I went through articles, but I'm requesting an answer for my instance. The relevant details are shown below,  precodeHealth Information: Cycle Count:  336 Condition:    Normal Health: 90% /code/pre  According to the console, it seems like something is happening.img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TT5q5.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ntAd8.png" alt="enter image description here"  The Mac, was put to sleep at 23:08, and according to the console it seems like it has been doing something.. so please give me expert advice, for that period about 8hours,  20% of the battery has drained :/ There are more stuff in the console, but I can post only 2 links here  <answer291111> I'd suggest going into Activity Monitor and see if there is any tasks using lots of CPU. I'd also recommend uninstalling/deleting any software that didn't come with the machine that you don't use or don't know how it because installed on your machine in the first place.  Also make sure you do all your app and system updates and restart your machine. If the issue persists I'd recommend taking it to an Apple Store or an authorised Apple Service centre and having a professional have a look  <comment367511> [battery graph](http://imgur.com/a/9UEzf#963MRDw)
