iMac encounters kernal panic if an Android phone is plugged in when booting <body> This is an issue I've noticed since I got the iMac but I only submitted it because I realized it is abnormal. My iMac wouldn't boot up if I have an Android phone plugged in via the USB cable. I've tried a number of phones over the years but got the same kernal panic message. An iPhone on the other hand wouldn't generate such message.  The oddity here is that I plugged my Samsung S7 into my Mac Pro today while booting, and it was fine. Then I realized it could be an isolated issue. So I tried Macbook Pro and it was fine. Then I tried booting into Windows 10 on the iMac, it was fine too. So I wipe everything on the iMac and installed a fresh 10.11.6, and it didn't fix it.  Anyone else had this issue before? How did you solve it?
