Screen Capture on Retina MacBook Pro at a Lower Resolution? <body> I use kbdCommand/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbd4/kbd to capture screenshots on my MacBook Pro with a Retina display.  I'd like to paste these captures immediately into another app I'm using. The problem I'm encountering is the resolution is so high, I have to first load them into an image editing app and scale them down 50%.  I was wondering if there was some system config to control the scaling of screen captured images automatically to save me the extra step?  <answer148184> I just ran into this exact issue the other day. Try RetinaCapture: it's a free app that captures screenshots in both 1x and 2x simultaneously (or, alternatively, just one or the other). And it's a "true" 1x capture: it redraws at 1x rather than taking the 2x version and scaling it down.  It also supports the same types of captures as the built-in Grab.app – full screen, timed screen, selection, or window – and you can save either to the clipboard or a file.  <answer173587> Try the "RetinaCapture" app - www.retinacapture.com/  <comment174634> Possible duplicate: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/105185/how-can-i-stop-my-retina-display-from-taking-2x-sized-screenshots <comment204242> Welcome to Ask Different!
