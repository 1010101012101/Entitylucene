Should I upgrade Mac OS 10.6.8 to El Capitan on Macbook Air 2010? <body> I have the Macbook Air 11' late 2010 with Core 2 Duo and 2 GB RAM. I decided to install XCode 7, but it requires Mac OS 10.11 El Capitan. So, should I upgrade OSX on my 5-yearold macbook air? I worry about work speed.  <answer225134> I'm posting this answer from a late 2010 11" MacBook Air running El Capitan, and I have no performance issues. It runs very well. But this machine has 4GB of RAM, not 2GB, and that might make a difference.  Remember that 10.6.8 has not received security updates for years now, and will be full of unpatched vulnerabilities. It is a risk to keep running it.  <answer225238> Here is a link to Mac's system requirements for El Capitan. http://osxdaily.com/2015/06/09/os-x-el-capitan-system-requirements-compatible-mac/  Macbook Air is listed as needing "MacBook Air (Late 2008 or newer)".  In addition, you mentioned your processor.     ... the Mac must have a 64-bit CPU, which is typically   an Intel Core 2 Duo or newer processor. Beyond that, the requirements   are pretty soft and forgiving   Based on the system requirements released by Mac, you sound clear.  <comment273187> 10.6.8 for me as Windows XP for Windows-users. The last optimal and stable Mac OS version from Jobs. Also there is the new technology - Metal - in El Capitan, but it is not supported on macbook air 2010 videocard. Do u made clear install or updating? <comment273191> I updated, but I updated through every version on the way. If I was going straight from 10.6 to 10.11, I think I would do a clean install. <comment273193> What's the better way to backup all files? <comment273194> Time Machine, either to a Time Capsule or to an external drive. <comment273195> yes, I forget about Time Machine, thanks! <comment273276> I always run the latest software on all my Apple stuff (iPhone 6s, iPad Air, 2009 MacBook Pro, Apple Watch) and really never have any problems. Don't worry about it.
