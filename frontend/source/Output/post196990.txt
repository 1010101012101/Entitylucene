How to identify codec (AAC vs ALAC) used in an m4a file <body> Given that the m4a format is merely a container, and can contain music encoded with a lossy (AAC) or lossless (ALAC) codec, is there a simple way to determine which codec was used for a given file?  <answer197013> If you go to codeiTunes &gt; View &gt; View Options &gt; Show Columns &gt; Kind/code it will include a column that tells you if the file is Apple Lossless or AAC  <answer197021> When I use the codefile/code command on an .m4a file, I get back a generic response of "ISO Media, Apple iTunes ALAC/AAC-LC (.M4A) Audio" for both AAC and ALAC files. I can think of two other approaches off the top of my head that don't require either the heavy hand of iTunes or installing new software :  ol liOpen the audio file in question with QuickTime Player. Select "Show Movie Inspector" from the 'Window' menu (or press âŒ˜-i) to see the file's size, data rate, and the codec used in its creation./li liUse the codeafinfo/code (audio file info) command in Terminal.app to get a more information than QuickTime Player provides. Here's some sample output:      precode$ afinfo /Users/admin/Desktop/01\ The\ Guns\ of\ August\ 1.m4a  Num Tracks: 1 Data format: 2 ch,  44100 Hz, 'alac' (0x00000001) from 16-bit source  4096 frames/packet  Channel layout: Stereo (L R)  estimated duration: 18702.930431 sec audio bytes: 1006059541  audio packets: 201367 bit rate: 430332 bits per second  packet size upper bound: 12334 maximum packet size: 12334  audio data file offset: 48  optimized audio  824799232 valid frames + 0 priming + 0 remainder = 824799232 /code/pre    /li /ol  hr  emFor any readers unfamiliar with using the terminal, it's quite simple, and you won't break anything. Open Terminal, and type in--or cut and paste from below--the word afinfo followed by a single space:/em  precodeafinfo  /code/pre  emNext, drag an audio file over to the Terminal window and drop it in. You will see the file's path get appended to the afinfo command. If dragging the icon caused the Finder to become the active process, you'll need to click on the Terminal's window to wake it up before the final step of pressing enter to run the command. If you like, you can get information on more than one file at a time by dragging and dropping multiple icons instead of just one. When you're finished, just quit Terminal.app as you would any other program./em
