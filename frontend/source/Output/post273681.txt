What type of provisioning profile is required for TestFlight external testing? <body> I've been trying to get Ionic push notifications to work on my TestFlight app for beta-testing for weeks now and I still have not managed to implement them successfully. When I build for release via Xcode, everything works fine. I have double-checked to ensure that the necessary certificates are set up fine yet for some reason however, push notifications fail to be received (though device token registration works fine) on TestFlight.  I have read many conflicting answers on forums, documentations and tutorials stating that an Ad-hoc provisioning profile is needed for TestFlight while others state that a distribution profile must be used. First of all, somehow the Ad-hoc profile does not attach with the build when I Archive and try to upload onto TestFlight via Xcode. Second of all, I have managed to upload on TestFlight using the Distribution profile but the push notifications are not received. I am now stumped on how I have to get push notifications to work on TestFlight.  My question is: which provisioning profile has to be used for a TestFlight app and what could be the reason why it is not working? Thank you.  <answer276872> I have few questions for you,  ol liDid you check push notification getting to your device in developing mode?/li liDid you deployed .pem/p12 file in the backend setup for distribution mode?/li /ol  If you have done with both of them and still con't proceed, then there might be problem with any of the following  ol liUnchecked your testing devices when generating strongAd-hoc Provisioning Profile/strong  ./li liProblem while exporting strongp12/strong file or generating strong.pem/strong file./li liTry validating your build before uploading it to the strongTestflight/strong./li /ol  <answer276873> Since Testflight has been integrated in the App Store / iTunes Connect, you'll need to upload it to iTunes Connect, which means you need an emApp Store/em provisioning profile, not an emAd-Hoc/em one. I can imagine that older tutorials, made when Testflight was a stand-alone platform, still describe the situation were an Ad-Hoc provisioning profile was necessary.  As for the push notifications:  ul liare you sure you use the Production environment of APN (the Sandbox environment only works for debug builds)?/li lido you get any error messages (on the server) when sending the push notifications?/li liif you call the Feedback service of APN, do the devices appear there?/li /ul  <comment344098> Have you tried looking [here](https://developer.apple.com/testflight/) for information?
