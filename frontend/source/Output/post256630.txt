Apple Developer: Distributing apps in-house and managing ios devices remotely <body> I'm developing an iOS app for my company which will be running on 5 iPads located in our salesroom. Do I have to enroll to the Apple Enterprise Developer Program or is it enough to buy the "normal" Apple Developer Program membership and use Ad-Hod app distribution?  Additionally, is there a method to remotely manage those iPads? For example, push updates to my app and automatically run it afterwards, perform iOS updates and shut down and turn them back on a daily basis/manually.
