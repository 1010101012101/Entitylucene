How to import dashboard stickies from an old hard disk without using migration assistant? <body> I recently installed a new hard drive in my Macbook Pro for a fresh installation of OSX Lion.  How can I get my dashboard stickies from the old hard disk without using migration assistant?  <answer55393> You'll need to copy two files from the old installation of OSX:  precode~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dashboard.plist ~/Library/Preferences/widget-com.apple.widget.stickies.plist /code/pre  The first tells Dashboard which Widgets to show, the second contains your notes.  Copy these to your new code~/Library/Preferences/code and you should be good.  You'll need to restart, logout and login, or kill the Dock, for example by opening Terminal and running codekillall Dock/code.  It worked for me - but I should warn that my home path was the same on the old install and new install.  <answer120973> Make sure that you guys are in the users library (Users/Your username/Library) which I believe is hidden by default. This is different than the computer's Library folder (contains application support and all the other non-user dependent stuff).  I was able to find the file there when I originally thought it would be in the main library folder.  <comment63711> While we're on the subject, have you found a way to get stickies to retain type and size information? There is a "use as default" menu item but it has no effect (for me anyway). <comment63724> I don't know if I've ever been able to resize the stickies on the dashboard, sorry I'm of no help. <comment63740> Chris: resizing is not the problem (it's easy), remembering a default typeface and size is my question. I find the default 10 pt Helvetica (or whatever it is) tough to read and prefer a larger typeface. I'd like all new stickies to assume that size and typeface. I thought if I just changed one to what I wanted, then chose "use as default" it would work. It has never worked for me. I'm wondering if you or anyone else has ever had this work. I should probably post this as a new question...
