Macbook pro, boot camp, can't enable wifi adapter <body> I installed Windows 8 on my macbook pro (Item No : 8899069, Mftr Part No : MD313LL/A) via boot camp. I installed the boot camp support tools. The wifi adapter says that it is working correctly. However, when I go into the control panel, the wifi adapter is not enabled. When I try to enable it, it says "enabling...", but then goes away. It's not enabled afterwards.  I tried to uninstall the driver, and then repair the support tools. No luck.  I followed these directions, with no luck. I also tried to run setup.exe from these drivers, with no luck. Last, I tried to run setup.exe in compatibility mode, with no luck.  Has anyone been able to get the macbook wifi enabled in Windows 8? It reminds me of a time when I couldn't get my wifi card to work, and then I realized I didn't press the 'enable wifi' button on my pc.  I don't even see an error in the event viewer :(  Has anyone been able to get wifi to work in windows 8?  EDIT: The network card is a Broadcom 802.11n network adapter (as per the device manager)  <answer121311> Try to install the Windows 8.1 driver from this website: Link (or here you have the Download Link directly: download).  One solution would be:      ol   liBoot into OS X/li   liSelect Windows as primary boot partition/li   liRestart your Mac (it should boot now directly into Windows)/li   liRestart Windows (NOT turning off. Start  Restart)/li   /ol   Second suggestion:     ol   liUninstall the driver completely /li   liRestart into OS X/li   liThen restart into Windows/li   /ol   Sometimes the WiFi driver is working after a few minutes. If not: Install the driver from above (from the Download link).  It has something to do with Bootcamp and Mac. This isn't a Windows problem. The driver isn't loading properly. Maybe Apple is going to fix this.  <answer122266> I bought an Edimax wireless card to see if it resolved the problem, but I had similar issues.  As per Edimax support:   ol liPlease uninstall ZoneAlarm/li liReboot your computer/li liThen you can enable the wireless network connection/li liAfter the wireless is working properly, you can re-install ZoneAlarm back./li /ol  I've tested steps 1-3, and now both the built in wifi and the edimax card work.  <comment141608> I didn't have luck with this unfortunately. The drivers you linked to wouldn't install successfully. And the device is still disabled after following these steps. <comment141610> Side question: Why does the boot camp select drive menu also have a drop down for wireless networks? <comment142319> The answer to the side question is that you can reinstall OSX via wifi from the boot menu, and this is an interface to connect to secured wireless connections.
