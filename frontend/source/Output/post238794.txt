How do I change iTunes to new email address <body> I had used an answer for changing my new email address back to my old, as was suggested in a prior recommendation.  Now, the system wants to send a code to my old address in order to make the change. The problem is that I no longer have access to my old email address. As it stands, I no longer can use iTunes as it shows my old address in grey and it doesn't allow me to change it to my new address. What can I do?  <answer238880> If you cannot gain access using the security questions, the only option you have is to contact Apple Support.
