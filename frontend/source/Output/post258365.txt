Is there any official reason why OSX does not have a native package manager? <body> I’m new in the OSX world, after a few search on internet, I realized that all package managers for OSX are 3rd party tools.br OSX as a Unix-based system, I just can’t imagine that Apple hasn’t thought about a built-in package manager.  ol listrongIs there any reason why Apple didn’t provide a packet manager ?/strong/li listrongDoes Apple (officially or not) support one of the existing 3rd party package managers ?/strong emI heard that the author of Homebrew is now working for Apple/em /li /ol  <answer258367> Apple's primary audience are not command line users.  Apple provide the Mac App Store for distribution and updating of both their own and third party software. The store can be reached through strongApplications  App Store.app/strong.  With regard to the history of Homebrew and Max Howell's employment by Apple, Max has since left Apple.  <comment322962> Various Macports developers have also worked at Apple e.g. Jordan Hubbard <comment322965> And yet,  OSX has become the most used desktop operating system among developers.   http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016#technology-desktop-operating-system <comment322968> Consider Apple's viewpoint. Why dedicate engineering resources to a package manager when the community has filled the need? How would a package manager benefit Apple's primary audience – the general public? Consider [asking Apple directly](https://www.apple.com/feedback/) or lodge an enhancement bug.
