TestFlight user received invitation, but no apps available from within TestFlight app <body> I sent a bunch of invitations for users to join the TestFlight beta for my app.  For the most part, it's worked fine, and many people are using it successfully.  But one user, who received the TestFlight invitation and installed the TestFlight app, does not see my app available to download when they launch TestFlight.  This user does have an iPhone that was registered in South Korea originally; could that have anything to do with it?  For what other reasons would a user not be able to access the beta after receiving an invitation?
