Boot Camp "Non System Disk" <body> I'm trying to install Windows via USB on my 2010 MacBook Pro (by doing some plist editing, it doesn't matter). I used the Boot Camp Assistant to create a bootable flash drive, and let it install the software. (I did have an SD card in there at the time). So it worked, and I partitioned 64gb of space for Windows for playing games, and suddenly...  "Non system disk".  How do I fix this? Should I install rEFIt? I've booted back into OS X at the moment. Using Yosemite 10.10.1.  EDIT: I've installed rEFInd and now I'm confused as to what to do next. I deleted the Boot Camp partition.
