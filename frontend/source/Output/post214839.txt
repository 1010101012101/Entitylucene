How to solve the issue of "%" on Calculator giving different results on iPhone vs Mac? <body> To see the result of  precode2000 × 19% / 12 /code/pre  I used both the Mac's Calculator app (with El Capitan or Mavericks), vs on the iPhone with iOS 9.1.  On the Mac, when I press code2000/code, code×/code, code19/code, code%/code, it gives me code380/code, but when I press the division button code÷/code, then it gives code760000/code right away, and finishing with pressing code12/code, code=/code gives code63333.33333333/code.  On the iPhone, I do get the expected result:  code31.6666/code.  So how can this be understood and how can it be done on the Mac?  <answer214843> Here's a short article that does a good job of describing the behaviour you're observing with OS X's in-built Calculator app: How does the calculator percent key work?  h2What's going on?/h2  When performing an operation involving two values followed by the percent key, the product is first calculated (i.e. code2000 x 19 %/code = code380/code) and this then replaces the second value in the emongoing/em calculation, which becomes code2000 x 380/code. When you then press the division key code÷/code the product of the ongoing operation is calculated (code2000 x 380 = 760,000/code), as you described, before you input the divisor to perform another operation.  h2Working with percentages using OS X's in-built Calculator/h2  To work with percentages in this instance you should express them in decimal form:  precode2000 × 0.19 ÷ 12 = 31.6666 /code/pre  This works with both iOS's and OS X's Calculator. I would advise against using the percent key in favour of working with decimals. The same can be said when using physical calculators, where the behaviour can differ between models.  <comment259483> thanks for your answer.  I am somewhat stunned to know of "the way to use it on the Mac is not to use it"
