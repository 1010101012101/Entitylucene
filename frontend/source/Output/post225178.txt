Mac losing connection every 10 minutes. Have to turn wifi off/on every time <body> I'm having a problem with my Mac Air with OSX X Yosemite.  It loses the wifi connection every about 10 minutes.  Interestingly, connection summary shows Internet as recheable:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wWztr.png" alt="enter image description here"  To solve it, I have to turn off/on my wifi every time.  I had tried this solution, which seems to work for a while,  but does not solve definitely.  strongThis problem doesn't occurs in others devices using the same Wifi/strong  <comment273227> Have you tried upgrading to El Capitan (10.11)? <comment273232> Not yet.. Without time right now. Upgrade would solve this issue? <comment273323> I can't promise it would, but I believe many people have found that applying OS X updates fixed the widespread WiFi connection problems that people were seeing a couple of years ago. <comment273369> I've experienced the same problem on El Capitan, so upgrading might not solve this issue. Followed a guide myself and it seems to work. <comment274864> @Hoshts which guide? <comment274865> @nekomatic I updated the to El Capitan and solved this problem for some days. Now, its back again.. <comment274877> @Rodrigo it's the same guide as you mentioned.
