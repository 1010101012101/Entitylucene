iPhone home screen not showing after erasing network and content settings <body> I have erased my network and content setting from iPhone 5s. Now my home screen does not show anything. I want my home screen icons and apps back. How can I do that, or how can I reinstall them? I want this screen, kindly help me out.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UEx3H.jpg" alt="Example of iPhone home screen"  <answer141257> If you have not powered off the phone recently, try that. A reboot often works wonders. Also what happens if you swipe right to left, do you get other apps? Are there 2 or more dots centered just above the dock? What I am getting at is it may be that you just have a blank home screen and all your apps have somehow moved to other screens. Swiping might reveal them and allow you to move them back.  Wiping just the network setting should affect nothing else. I've done it many times and never an app out of place.  Hopefully you have backed up your phone recently, you may have to restore from backup.  <answer141267> As mentioned above, powering the phone off and turning it back on is one option.   Another option is to reset it which involves pressing and holding both the power button (top right) and the home button (bottom front center).  The reset process should not affect user data, but should reset some settings that may cause the screen to display correctly.  There is also a software reset (inside iOS 7) through General - Reset - Reset Home Screen Layout. I have not personally tried this but it may correct your situation.  The Reset page also includes reset options that erase all data and settings. You may want to try one of those.  Have you backed up your phone to your computer lately?  If none of these options work, and the phone is new, I suggest taking it back to the store where you made the purchase.  HTH.  <comment166359> Are you just left with the default iPhone apps?
