Upgrade iPad to newer (but not latest) iOS <body> How do I upgrade my iPad 3 from iOS 5.1 to 7.x (now when the latest version is 8)?  <answer211890> ul liFirst backup your iPad in case something goes wrong (if you have jailbroken your device I advice you to save your shsh blobs, it's not necessary)./li liNext download the os version you want to upgrade to from https://ipsw.me/ /li liFinally open iTunes, cancel if asked for an update. Go to your iPad's summary page. Hold alt/option key (OS X), or Shift key (Windows) and click on restore. A window will show up choose the ipsw your downloaded before and and your upgrade will start. Then afterwards reinstall the backup. /li /ul  <comment255851> iOS 9 is perfectly fine. It's a little buggy, but you don't have to worry about it screwing up your iPad 3. <comment255852> What site is ripsaw.me and does it contain legal software? <comment255865> @Mark Yes it contains ipsw <comment255936> @RedEagle2000 I'm mostly worried about performance when running iOS 8 or 9 on an old iPad 3. Isn't it slower than iOS5, require more memory etc? <comment256034> I would advise against downloading any software from a non Apple source. They may be OK (probably in fact) but there is an increased risk of malware. This is not a comment against this particular website. <comment256036> @AliBeadle the website only mirrors the correct ipsw for the iDevice, the download link comes from apple.com ! Check http://api.ipsw.me/docs/ <comment256039> Just verified that ( http://c2n.me/3pc12kE.png ), that's great. <comment256041> @salle Hope my answer will help you. <comment256425> Happy to help :) <comment280825> @Tetsujin This question is interesting, because at the time that OP asked the question, Apple was still signing iOS 7. So while the answer is quite simple for this particular question (download the IPSW and restore with iTunes), and the answer was relevant for a short time, it shortly became stale. Regardless, it was always a duplicate of that question. So whether the mods want to mark it that way is up to them. Like you, my stance is that it is a duplicate, so I'm going to flag it as well. <comment280831> Apple are *still* signing iOS 7, if you have an iPhone 4. Not for anything else. I'm marking any of these 'can I have something other than current iOS' questions that I find as a dupe of that particular one, because the answers are the most canonical. <comment366655> Thanks for the site, but I don't really see how this helps since usually all but the latest version is unsigned and can't be restored in iTunes.
