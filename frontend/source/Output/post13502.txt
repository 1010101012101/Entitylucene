Transparent Background in Terminal? <body> On Ubuntu, I can change the terminal background to be semi-transparent.  I've seen other people do this in OSX, but I don't see the setting anywhere.  Is there some way to make this happen?  <answer13503> When you select the color picker for the Window - there's an opacity slider there:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MlZTg.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer224622> ol liopen Terminal/li liin menu bar: Terminal  preferences  profiles  text  Background  color &amp; effects/li liyou will get something like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YDte3.jpg" alt="enter image description here"/li liplay with different blur values/li liEnjoy/li /ol  <comment14316> Aha! Thanks!  Now I feel like an idiot. :) <comment19022> +1 - Thanks very much. I've been searching too and it never occurred to me to look there. <comment148159> Only setting Opacity (Deckkraft) and Cmd-N to open a new termnial made no difference. I do get to choose a background color and it applies directly to the TotalTerminal window, but no effect on new non-TotalTerminal windows.
