Can the iPad support multiple Regional Settings simultaneously? <body> I need spell-checking in different languages such as English, German and Norwegian. I currently have only German spell-checking and it is quite irritating that it messes up with other languages' words. Is there some easy way of having spell-checking in multiple languages on the iPad?   What about keyboards? Is it possible to have many regional settings on one iPad, easily?  <answer61787> You can have multiple keyboards enabled: codeSettings -&gt; General -&gt; Keyboard -&gt; International Keyboards/code. Add whichever keyboards you wish. Then, when you are typing text, hit the globe key on the keyboard to switch between the different keyboards.  As far as I know, you can't have multiple languages enabled at the same time for spell checking. However, you can switch between them using codeSettings -&gt; International -&gt; Language/code.  <comment71371> Spell-checking is tied to the currently-selected keyboard so zwitching keyboard result in different language suggestions. Thank you, worked +1, aber `"Einstellungen  Allgemein  Tastatur  Internationale Tastaturen"` und `"Einstellungen  Landeseinstellungen   Sprache"` ;)
