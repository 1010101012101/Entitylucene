What should I do to restore my computer's hard drive to how it was before I partitioned it? (and do I need to?) <body> For a few months, I used the hard drive on my iMac to do Time Machine backups for my MacBook until I got a Time Capsule. Since Time Machine refused to back up directly to the iMac's HD, I partitioned it and backed up to the partition.  The partitioning didn't seem to be a very simple process. I meanâ€”what I did was simple, but Disk Utility spent hours and hours moving Core Storage data to a different part of the disk, and in the end actually messed up and overshot the partition size: what was supposed to be 500 GB became 1.11 TB.  Now that I have the Time Capsule and I'm backing up to it, I deleted the partition on the iMac, and I just have one partition again. However, I'm a little uncertain because the deletion was very quick and I wonder if I would do better to put those Core Storage files back where they came from somehow.  So my question(s) deal(s) with that. Should I expect my Mac to take a performance hit because those files were disturbed? If so, how would I go about restructuring them? I suppose it's a lot of worry for a small problem, especially when everything is working fine, but I want to make sure I'm not making some mistake here.
