My Gmail messages bear "MacBook Pro" rather than my name <body> A few days ago I purchased a MacBook Pro 13.3" and now notice that Gmail messages I send from it do not bear my name but instead say "Macbook Pro."  How can I replace "Macbook Pro" with my name?  <comment207858> In the header field? Using Mail.app or through a browser? Please provide more detail. <comment208112> Hi. Thanks. I was able to solve this via the Apple icon  System Preferences  Users & Groups.
