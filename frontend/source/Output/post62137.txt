Finder Search attribute "Tags" <body> It looks like the search attribute "Tags" is no longer available in the Mountain Lion Finder. I used this to quickly find Open Meta Taggged files on my Mac by means of a Smart Folder. Is there an alternative way?  mdfind still recognizes tags  "mdfind tag:tagname" works fine. Obviously the same holds for Spotlight "tag:tagname" works fine.   <comment71782> Do you mean Mountain Lion **Finder or Spotlight**? <comment71784> Mountain Lion Finder - when you start a search query you can select "other" and you could select "tags". Spotlight (like mdfind) still works find since you can still find tag:tagname in Spotlight.
