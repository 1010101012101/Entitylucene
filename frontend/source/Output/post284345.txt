How do you activate an iPhone with broken home button iOS 10 <body> My iPhone 5s had recently been cleaned of all files and data, including iCloud so I need to activate it. It prompts me to press the home button to activate but the home button on my iPhone doesn't work. Is there a way I can activate this phone without pressing the home button?  <answer284348> You can activate Assistive Touch to have a floating software button that will let you press the home button.   Go to Settings App  General  Accessibility  AssistiveTouch (slide switch to the right)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vOuXa.png" alt="assistive touch"  <answer284349> If you can't summon an on-screen home button, you can always perform activation on iTunes connected to USB.
