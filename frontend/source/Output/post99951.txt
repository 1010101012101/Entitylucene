How to make the email app on iOS work like Gmail app? <body> I tried searching for codeMacy's e-receipt/code by typing in codeMacy receipt/code on my Mac using Gmail, and the result came back in 1 second. (some of those emails were 1 month old, and another one 2 months old).  But when I tried that using the email app on iPhone with iOS 6.1.4, nothing came back, and I click "Subject", and I changed the keyword to codeMacy's e-receipt/code and clicked "Continue Search on Server..." and it just kept on turning the spinning wheel for 2 minutes and nothing came back.  And then I searched for and installed the Gmail app on the iPhone, and type in codeMacy receipt/code and the result came back in 1 second.  So how do I make the email app standard on iOS work like Gmail's search?  <comment117597> @tubedogg does that question tell you how to make the email app work like Gmail's app or does it tell you to just use the Gmail app instead? <comment117598> The underlying issue is that Mail.app's search appears to be broken when using it on a Gmail account. There is no way to fix that short of re-engineering Mail.app, which unless you work at Apple is not going to be possible.
