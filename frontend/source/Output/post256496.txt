Unable to install an application for me only <body> I'm currently installing Microsoft Office 2016, I have two accounts on my Mac and I would like to install it for me only. However, the option is greyed out: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZlZPy.png" alt="enter image description here"  How can I do the installation only for me? Is it possible by moving the code.pkg/code or should I just move the apps once installed? I am an administrator on the machine so I do not understand why it is not possible.
