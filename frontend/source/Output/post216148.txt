What is "Paused (On Battery)" mean in Mail.app? <body> I saw the message "Downloading Messages Paused (On Battery)" in Mail.app in El Capitan.  What does this mean? The MacBook was plugged in to the wall, not running on battery. What would cause downloading to stop/pause?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/95cy9.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer226110> It may have paused while you were operating on battery power. See the referenced support page from apple.  https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205263  <answer286946> The article is not useful if you want to disable this behavior when mobile. There is indeed a way to change this to operate as though it was plugged in.  <comment274534> Welcome to Ask Different.
