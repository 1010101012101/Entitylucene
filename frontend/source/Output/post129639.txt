Disable "Updates Ready to Install" <body> Apps from OS X 10.9 (Mavericks) have started to ask me to restart when there are updates ready to install. Is it possible to completely disable this notification?  Screenshot of notification:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BGOOa.png" alt="updates-ready-to-install"  <answer129651> To stop the notifications, go to System Preferences  App Store and disable 'check automatically for updates.' This will stop the notifications.
