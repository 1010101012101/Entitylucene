⌘+Delete does not work in Firefox <body> Firefox, for whatever reason, doesn't support the OS X-standard kbd⌘/kbdkbdDelete/kbd shortcut for deleting the current line of text.   How do I get it back?   10.8 with FF22, but this behavior has been around for a while.   <answer95825> It doesn't work for me either. You can use control-U to delete a complete line, but it also deletes the part on the right side of the caret.  Or if you use KeyRemap4MacBook, add something like this to private.xml:  precode&lt;item&gt;   &lt;name&gt;firefoxcmddelete&lt;/name&gt;   &lt;identifier&gt;firefoxcmddelete&lt;/identifier&gt;   &lt;only&gt;FIREFOX&lt;/only&gt;   &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::DELETE, VK_COMMAND | ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::CURSOR_LEFT, ModifierFlag::SHIFT_L | ModifierFlag::COMMAND_L, KeyCode::DELETE&lt;/autogen&gt; &lt;/item&gt; /code/pre  <comment112463> How come you are not a Mod ? By choice ? <comment112526> I'd note that Ctrl-U doesn't work on Stack Exchange answer boxes, because it is coded in the page as a shortcut to create an unordered list - as I discovered while trying to answer this last night :) <comment127382> control-U does nothing at all in Firefox 25.0, iMac 10.8.3; it used to work, delete line, in ff 21.0. grrrrrr
