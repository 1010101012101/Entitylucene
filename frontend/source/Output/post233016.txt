In Yosemite, suddenly the application Photos is not open anymore <body> Photo.app does not open when clicked on in the dock or in the list of apps. Message comes up "The application "Photos.app" is not open anymore". How can I re-open it?  <answer264273> I'd try clearing the saved state files.  From Finder:    ul likbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd N /kbd  /li likbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd Shift ⇧ /kbd   kbd G  /kbd    /li liCopy/paste code~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Photos/Data/Library/Saved Application State/code/li /ul  Find the folder com.apple.Photos.savedState and delete it. That should give Photos a fresh start.  <comment331113> Link to http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/264218/photos-app-not-responding/264272#264272
