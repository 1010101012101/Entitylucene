What methods are available to (re)install Lion on a Mac? <body> With genuine Lion install media being a rarety (and only included on certain newer Macs), there are a lot of queries by users on how they are best able to re-install (or even simply install) Lion on their computers.  I think it would be very useful to have a single canonical answer that is able to present every sensible install option on a single page, from which machines include the USB install media to how to use Internet Recovery, and all the homebrew options of self burning an image to DVD etc inbetween.  So, what methods are you aware of, or have you used, to re-install Lion on your Mac?  Please try to include 1 answer per answer, and detail it as fully as possible in order to prevent duplicate answers, or answers that contain bits of the method etc.  Feel free to edit others answers to increase the detail level. Try not to link to existing guides or external webpages without summarising or paraphasing, it is far better to include the information directly on this site.  <answer47246> h1Buy a bootable OS X Lion USB stick/h1  You can buy a bootable OS X Lion USB Thumb Drive from the Apple Store: http://store.apple.com/us/product/MD256Z/A  img src="https://i.imgur.com/iXU2K.jpg" alt=""  <answer47247> h1Lion Recovery (requires internet connection)/h1     Reinstalling OS X Lion via Lion Recovery requires broadband access to   the Internet via Wi-Fi or an Ethernet connection.

This will install Lion after a reboot. Your strongapplications and personal data will not be removed/strong. But you should perform a backup before the upgrade.  <answer47485> h1Using TimeMachine backup/h1  I only realised recently, but if you have used Time Machine on a mac with Lion, the restoring partition is also copied on the drive. So you can simply choose to boot from the TM backup drive, and install lion from there. The restoring partition is moved on the internal drive, and then installing is the same with other procedures .  <answer47486> h1Use Lion Recovery Disk Assistant/h1  A third way is to download the Lion Recovery Disk Assistant which is 1MB in size and will preform the upgrade to Lion. For this option, an existing Recovery HD and an external hard drive is needed and what is does is the following: reinstall Lion, repair the disk using Disk Utility, restore from a Time Machine backup.  <answer47488> h1Upgrade install (from Leopard)/h1  Since you need the Mac App Store, Snow Leopard is required to install Lion. But when you have a copy of Lion (being a bootable disk mentioned above or a Thumb Drive), you don't need Snow Leopard to install Lion.    It's more of a brute-force method, but it will work.br There are three main steps in this process. Backup your data, clean your hard drive and install Lion on the clean drive.   There is a more in-depth tutorial on how to install Lion over Leopard.  <comment54138> Ah, bummer, too late I see. <comment54139> Not too late to improve., the other answers need splitting out - 1 method per answer, and you can still get busy increasing details - screenshots, commentary, gotchas etc. <comment54140> So, you want just one method per answer? <comment54141> Yes, that way each answer is canonical, and there is no duplication.  Anyone can then improve an existing one without worrying about treading on toes. <comment54142> Ok, I'm on it!! <comment54144> **Restoring iLife**: On a Mac that came shipped with Lion, you can simply re-download iLife from the Mac App Store after signing in with your Apple ID.
