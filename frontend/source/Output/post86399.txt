New photos added to iPhoto aren't available for creating books <body> Some time ago I started creating a book with iPhoto. Since then I uploaded new photos to iPhoto, but they are not available amongst the photos I can use to create the book.  How can I have them available? They are in the library.  <answer88370> I have always had to place new photos into my project to be able to use them.  Once I do they are listed among the available options in the Keepsakes editing screen.  To do this:  ol liSelect photos you want to use./li liDrag and drop into your project shown in the left column under "Keepsakes"./li liOpen your project. /li /ol  Voil√†! They should show up as options for use in your book.
