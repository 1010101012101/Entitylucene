iPhone 6 after death <body> My 89 yr old Dad just died.  Before I catch static, yes, I have a death certificate.  He was somewhat forgetful and would often forget passwords and reset them (and forget those too).  I have his phone and I know his iCloud ID but I do not know his phone unlock code nor his iCloud ID.  When I try to reset his iCloud ID, it wants to notify his iPhone (which I cant unlock).  Can I:  ol lierase his iPhone -- so it will be unlocked/li lihave iCloud send the password reset to the iPhone/li liget into his iCloud and then restore the phone?/li /ol  <answer271079> If you don't have any way to get in to his iCloud:  Reset the iPhone.  If you have the iCloud password:  Unlock the passcode with iCloud.  <comment340642> Look at the answers to [this question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/150517/88313) and see if they help.  Your options are limited. <comment340748> Do you have access to the email account he used to setup iCloud? <comment340846> Just want to say sorry for your loss, feel ya. If your problem is unresolved after a while, comment back `@owlswipe` and I can devote some extra effort. <comment341698> My condolences. You can reset the iPhone, then unlock it with the iCloud account. If you cannot gain access to the iCloud account you will have to conjure up the receipt and bring the receipt and death certificate to an Apple Store. With that information, they can unlock the iPhone for you.
