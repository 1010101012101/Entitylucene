How to disable automatic song rating in iTunes <body> If I give one song on an album 5 stars, iTunes automatically gives all the other songs on the album 5 stars. If I give one song on an album 5 stars and another 3 stars, iTunes automatically gives all the other songs on the album 4 stars: i.e. the average of my ratings. This doesn't work for me.  If I sort my library by number of stars to create a playlist of favourite songs, I now have a bunch of songs automatically rated at 4 or 5 stars, interspersed among songs I've actually heard, liked and would like to hear again. That gets in the way of a simple select, drag and drop.  Has anyone figured out how to disable the automatic rating function? None of the suggestions offered here work for me: How to remove the automatic ratings from songs in iTunes?
