How can I test with Internet Explorer while on my Mac? <body> I work on a Mac, but most of my users are on Windows. What's an easy way to test my websites in IE 7, 8, &amp; 9?  Wine seems kinda buggy and unfriendly.  <answer58899> ol liDownload and Install the free Oracle Virtualbox Virtual Machine software  /li liUtilize the scripts noted in the OS X Daily article Internet Explorer for Mac the Easy Way: Run IE 7, IE8, &amp; IE9 Free in a Virtual Machine to download, convert and install Microsoft's free IE Testing VMs to be used on VirtualBox./li /ol     We’re going to walk you through how to install Internet Explorer 7, 8, or 9 in a virtual machine running Windows, directly in Mac OS X – for free.

There's VirtualBox as mentioned above, which is a free open source project. There are also two commercial offerings, Parallels and VMWare Fusion. Both of those have free trials so you can evaluate what might work best.  If you're wondering why to pay when VirtualBox is free, Parallels and Fusion are both commercially developed and strongsupported/strong software. If you run into problems, you can get help, rather than spend time searching for answers yourself. Additionally, VirtualBox is cross-platform, so it has fewer Mac niceties, and it's more of a DIY product - no quick setup or anything.  But you can make the call for yourself. TidBITS has a fairly recent article comparing Parallels and Fusion, with a good section on VirtualBox as well, and Ars Technica has a pretty comprehensive comparison of the latest versions of Parallels and Fusion.  Hope that's useful for you!  <answer59094> The age old question for web designers…  VirtualBox is awesome, but a pain to have multiple versions of Windows taking up space on your hard drive. Another option is using VirtualBox and only installing and running an app like ietester which is only available for Windows but allows you to render multiple versions of IE in one window.  Finally, my personal option of choice is a website called browserstack, You have to pay for it but it's really cheap and well worth it if this is how you make your living. I also own a Windows laptop just for doing thse kind of tests but more often than not use browserstack instead.  <answer73007> http://www.spoon.net is fantastic tool and the reason I prefer it is it installs emjust/em the browsers, and side-by-side with your other programs in task bar. It works like a charm, however it is commercial, $12 a month, $60 per year. They plan to publish the app. on Mac soon.  IETester is OK for some basic testing, but it doesn’t handle scripts correctly and therefore is not a 100% reliable testing solution.  <answer88865> Just thought I would add to this as I just found a great new free tool to view IE on a mac. Download "Sauce" from the mac app store. I have been using Virtualbox the last two years and this is much easier to install, doesn't have huge VM files, and the interface is much smoother. Sauce also has the ability to preview in IE 10 (which is complete crap). There is also another cloud based app called browser stack. Tried the free version and the interface is nice but it does cost some $$.   <answer88875> In addition to virtualization there's Codeweaver's CrossOver  http://www.codeweavers.com  <answer103564> I have the emperfect/em solution! In 2013, Microsoft released a free officially-supported solution to help Mac developers test with Internet Explorer versions 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 on Macs:  ol liGo to http://www.modern.ie/en-us/virtualization-tools/li liSelect your desired testing OS ("Mac")/li liPick a virtualization platform from among VMWare, Parallels, and VirtualBox. If in doubt, choose VirtualBox (which you can download from the VirtualBox site)/li liFollow the directions to download VMs for the version of IE + Windows you want/li liIf you're confused, check the detailed instructions from Microsoft and from Rey Bango/li /ol  Hope this helps.  <answer117015> I don't have enough reputation to post a comment on @Anirvan's answer which helped me greatly. I'd just like to add that Rey Bango's blog which advocates for security reasons to set Windows Update to automatic causes a problem since IE gets auto-updated as well! MS has created separate auto-blockers for IE 9 through 11. I downloaded all the auto-blocker scripts and created a wrapper to call them on Dropbox. Extract the contents of the zip file and run IE9-11_blocker.cmd to block IE 9 through 11.  <answer196697> h1A new, better answer./h1  First I used virtual box. Then I used browserstack  Now I use parallels  Around for a few years but lately made robust and even friendlier.  It's even easier than the others, setup is easier, saving state is easier, keyboard-mouse integration is better. Generally its better.  Only item of note is that it cost about $80  which should be petty change for most developer who are paid that in an hour or two.  Paid software is actually my preference - it gives me some confidence that it will actually be maintained going forward.  Plus I'm a developer... paying a... developer.  Seems like a good thing.  <answer272057> Probably not as professional as the other answers, but if one just wants to see how IE is rendering the site, the following options are free and work without any heavy installation:  ul liGoogle Chrome Extension strongIE Tab/strong (Windows only)/li liGoogle Chrome Extension strongIE-On-Chrome/strong/li lihttps://netrenderer.com//li lihttp://browsershots.org//li /ul  Note that none of them work locally (i.e localhost or 127.0.0.1).  Similar questions were asked in SO (here and here), but they are pretty old and the topics are closed.  <comment68131> Wine _is_ kind of unfriendly, but I have used [PlayOnMac](http://www.playonmac.com/en/) before which greatly improves the user experience. It has a GUI installer for Internet Explorer and might be worth a try before setting up a VM. <comment84927> Ah, I remember the days of space being an issue in these decisions.  Nowadays my 500GB drive seems to help quite a lot. <comment85113> I wish space wasn't an issue, all of my machines are 500gb plus and by the time I have my apps loaded (adobe master suite, autocad and ableton live+native instruments are the real space hogs here) my hard drive is feeling pretty stuffed already! let alone giving up the hundred odd gig of space it takes to run 5 different versions of windows. <comment103019> Yeah, but all I am looking to use is browsers.  I certainly would not want to use Adobe image manipulation tools through an emulator given the drag-drop and other interactivity issues there would be. <comment104196> http://crossbrowsertesting.com is also a useful and inexpensive site. It will also allow you local machine access in case you're need to do redirects to a local reverse proxy when you're testing. <comment121856> These instructions are potentially outdated. Microsoft now distributes Windows + IE 6-11 VMs for web developers in a variety of formats at http://www.modern.ie/en-us/virtualization-tools <comment121893> Anirvan, I tried that link and it all seems to be about subscription services (after free trial). Also many of the links don't go anywhere/  Not a solution I can recommend in the current form. <comment121926> go to that link, and click "Download a Virtual Machine" (instead of the Browserstack link). I have step by step instructions at http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/103564/1777 <comment162953> Microsoft now has free Mac virtual machines just for this purpose. https://www.modern.ie/en-us/virtualization-tools <comment185854> AWESOME!!!! Its a shame we need to do this at all, but this is the BEST solution. Great share. Thanks. <comment212327> New tool released by Microsoft - https://remote.modern.ie/ <comment215828> For sure... as a web dev in 2015 I will actually go the extra mile and say its fking ridiculous we have to run a virtualization tool to run a browser just to test... but hey, once they figure out fusion power in another 5 years maybe we will have a better solution lmfao <comment249901> Agreed. I wish we could emulate the browsers, or at least install them side-by-side. Too bad Microsoft has a terrible architecture across the board. On a mac the apps could come bundled with all the libs they need to run. Oh well. And as far as Web Dev 2015... Why are we even supporting IE*? *sob* <comment327096> Note this does not appear to be available in the UK
