What is the default working directory of a script run via launchd? <body> I'd expected this to be easy to find on Google, but wasn't able to discovery anything.  I know that the working directory of a launchd agent/demon can be changed via the codeworkingdirectory/code key. However, this key is optional. If no working directory is specified, what does macOS use?  <answer284758> The codeWorkingDirectory &lt;string&gt;/code in a emlaunchd.plist/em is an optional emkey/em used to specify a directory to chdir(2) to before running the job. If this emkey/em is not present, then the emroot/em code//code directory is used.  I verified this by running a emshell script/em as both a Launch Agent and a Launch Daemon that, when run, appended a directory listing to a text file. In all cases, without the codeWorkingDirectory &lt;string&gt;/code emkey/em, the output was the emroot/em  code//code directory of the emstartup disk/em.  Depending on whether or not it was run as emroot/em or the emcurrent user/em the output as emroot/em also contained the hidden directories even though that was not explicitly set to output by the script.  As a side note, the codePATH/code passed to the emshell script/em when run as both a Launch Agent and Launch Daemon was:  precode/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin /code/pre  Note that this was tested under OS X 10.8.5.
