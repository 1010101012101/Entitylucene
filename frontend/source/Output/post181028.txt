Mac crashes every time I try to run boot2docker <body> I recently got a new MacBook Pro running OS X 10.10.2, and I installed boot2docker 1.5.0 on it. Aside from Chrome, this is the first program I installed on my new machine. However, when I try to run it, the terminal window opens up for a few seconds, saying boot2docker is up, and then my computer restarts automatically.  I tried to uninstall 1.5.0 and install 1.4.1 (as that is what I was using on my last machine), but I encountered the same problem.  The last thing I see before my laptop restarts is this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8pQ56.png" alt=""  The error report my computer shows after the restart is this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EbTCN.png" alt=""  Has anyone every had this problem before, or know how I can address it?  EDIT: I downloaded the installer from boot2docker's github repo: github.com/boot2docker/osx-installer/releases  <answer181030> There's a problem with OS X Security Update 2015-003 and boot2docker/virtualbox as discussed here:  https://github.com/boot2docker/boot2docker/issues/800  The fix is to install the latest VirtualBox.  <comment215175> I forgot to mention, I downloaded the installer from boot2docker's github repo: https://github.com/boot2docker/osx-installer/releases <comment215177> Welcome to Ask Different!
