They are available in `/var/log/apache2/` if you use Apache as part of OSX. If you have installed your own web server, look wherever it writes its log files to. <comment280819> ::1 - - [07/Mar/2016:21:50:45 +0700] "GET /com/ HTTP/1.1" 404 1031 my website like this: localhost/com/ why it can't find com/ <comment280820> `DocumentRoot` could be wrong then. I would start with simple things (without rewrites and stuff) and, once they work, add the rest step by step. <comment280821> KROLNOEURN/Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/apache2/htdocs" This is document root right? and KROLNOEURN is a user <comment280822> `DocumentRoot` should be defined as such. And AFAIK the path used in a `Directory` block should be absolute (starting from `/`), how should Apache know where to find `KROLNOEURN` otherwise.
