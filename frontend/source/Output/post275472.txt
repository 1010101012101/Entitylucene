How to copy an Error message from Xcode 8? <body> I have seen this answer, which tells about copying a warning message(Which also does not work), however I always have to type that again in browser, How do i copy it  <answer275550> I've always just right-clicked onto the warning message and selected Copy. This then places it on the clipboard and is available for pasting into other apps.  Below are two emexamples/em of how the copied message looks on the clipboard (or when pasted somewhere else):     /Users/Username/Documents/Projects/Username (Developer)/iPhone   Apps/Trivia Apps/Draft Versions/Trivia Apps/App name.xcodeproj Update   to recommended settings      file:///Users/Username/Documents/Projects/Username%20(Developer)/iPhone%20Apps/Trivia%20Apps/Draft%20Versions/Trivia%20Apps/App%20name.xcodeproj/xcuserdata/Username.xcuserdatad/xcschemes/App%20name.xcscheme:   warning: Missing file: /Users/Username/Documents/Projects/Username   (Developer)/iPhone Apps/Trivia Apps/Draft Versions/App   name.xcodeproj/xcuserdata/Username.xcuserdatad/xcschemes/App   name.xcscheme is missing from working copy   strongNOTE:/strong Both of the above were copied from warning messages generated in Xcode 8.2.1, although I have changed the real username and app name.  If I'm misunderstanding your question, please clarify/let me know.  <comment346647> I do the same thing as @Monomeeth and I get the same results.  It appears that just plain copy/paste works fine.
