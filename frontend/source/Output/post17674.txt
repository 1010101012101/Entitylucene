Is there a way to export syntax color settings from one Xcode installation to a new one? <body> I have installed a new XCode 4 on a machine and I'd like to copy/paste the syntax coloring settings from the first one to the new one. How may I do this ?  <answer17677> Custom syntax color themes are located in  precode~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/FontAndColorThemes/ /code/pre  (Note that this directory may not exist if you've not yet modified any of your themes or haven't created a custom theme of your own, but will be created as soon as you do.)  The files have a code.dvtcolortheme/code extension. Simply retrieve the file from that directory and copy it into the same directory on another machine.  hr  I quite like Ethan Schoonover's strongemSolarized/em themes/strong; I find them to be very readable and easy on the eyes, and can be installed as explained above.  <answer244528> I found this answer while looking how to move the new (at the time of writing this answer) Civic theme in Xcode 8 to Xcode 7.3. Now themes are bundled inside of the Xcode application's bundle at following path:  precodeXcode.app/Contents/SharedFrameworks/DVTKit.framework/Versions/A/Resources/FontAndColorThemes /code/pre  Also Xcode8 theme has extension codexccolortheme/code while Xcode7.3 has codedvtcolortheme/code. From my experience - it's safe change the extension without modifying the file itself.  <answer250968> With Themeinstaller, you can just open .dvtcolortheme files and they will be installed in your Xcode folder.  In case you wanted some new themes there are many to be found on codethemes.net, having Themeinstaller, you can install them, just by clicking "install" under any of your choice.  <comment311879> How do you get the theme from your current Xcode?
