Downloads folder shows Access Denied icon <body> Starting this morning Chrome, Safari et all started showing my code~/Downloads/code with an access denied icon. Finder does strongnot/strong show this icon. I suspect this is something Code42 CrashPlan did overnight (it's a work issued MBP with some pre-installed apps). Now, the question is, how do I make my downloads again available?  ul liadding read/write myself and everyone via codechmod +ai/code/li liadding read/write myself and everyone via Finder - file - Get Info/li /ul  codels -el/code shows that code~/Downloads/code is missing some attributes compared to other folders like code~/Documents/code:  precodedrwx---rwx+  6 xx  yy   204 Jan 11 19:15 Documents  0: XX-AE59E7573812 allow list,add_file,search,add_subdirectory,delete_child,readattr,writeattr,readextattr,writeextattr,readsecurity drwx---rwx+ 25 xx  yy   850 Jan 27 08:35 Downloads  0: user:xx inherited allow list,add_file,delete  1: group:everyone inherited allow list,add_file,delete  2: group:owner inherited allow list,add_file,delete drwx---rwx@ 51 xx  yy  1734 Jan 24 16:41 Library  0: XX-AE59E7573812 allow list,add_file,search,add_subdirectory,delete_child,readattr,writeattr,readextattr,writeextattr,readsecurity /code/pre  The existing ACLs on code~/Downloads/code are the one I added myself. Still, the browsers show it as Access Denied. Attempt to save a download fails silently (no error, but no file either).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DjtKr.png" alt="enter image description here"  OS X El Capitan 10.11.6  <answer270541> Make sure this is emyour/em Downloads folder. Click the little upside-down carat next to the "Save As" text field to see an expanded window, press Command-Shift-H to go to your Home folder and then see if the Downloads folder there is still inaccessible.   <comment339988> Also, what's the result of "ls -el" in /Users/...since the permissions are inherited, let's see what they are inheriting. <comment339994> `Make sure this is your Downloads folder` D'oh, that was it! <comment340062> glad it was a simple solution. You might want to reset the permissions that you changed while trying to work on this problem. <comment340063> I tried to change "The existing ACLs on /~Downloads" to "...~/Downloads" but Ask Different won't let me because edits must be at least 6 characters.
