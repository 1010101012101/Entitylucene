Disk not recognized when plugging an external hard drive <body> Before I give up on my external hard drive, I wanted to give it a shot here.   I was working on iMovie with the library being on an external hard drive. At some point during the editing of a project, the application crashed which I believe was the start of my nightmare (sorry for the drama!). I don't recall the specifics now but shortly thereafter, the hard drive became inaccessible. Here's what I've tried:  ol liMounted on Win system using a couple of recovery software used at work - it was able to see the drive and strongsome/strong data. I was able to recover the data, but I could not open most of them./li liMounted on my MBP and tried "Stellar Phoenix" - same results and took almost 3 days./li liTried TestDisk - similar results except that I was not able to actually recover any data (or did not get the opportunity to)./li /ol  I came across a post relating to a "partition map" error which is what I saw when I tried to run First Aid in Disk Util which seemed to have fixed the error, but I still can't access the drive. When running DiskUtil in Terminal, here's what I get for the drive now:  precode/dev/disk2 (external, physical): #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER 0:                                                   *801.6 GB   disk2 /code/pre  Any suggestions is greatly appreciated before I put this issue to bed and say my goodbye to this hard drive. The drive contains a lot of media - family photos and videos of 5 years. Unfortunately, that same week was when I had planned to backup my data and this happened - hard lesson learned! Thanks in advance!  I am on a MBP Ret, Mid-2014 with El Capitan.
