Is there a way to completely disable Spaces in Yosemite? <body> Is there a way to completely disable Spaces in Yosemite (without turning off Mission Control, Dashboard, etc.)?   As someone who frequently switches between multiple monitors and using my Macbook on its own, I frequently run into baffling setups where windows on one monitor become a Space on another monitor. I'd like to end this behavior.   <answer163145> I did this recently to get an iMac to better support an X-Arcade Tankstick and MAME. I do not know that it totally disabled Spaces, but is has effectively eliminated them for me.  ol liSystem Preferences  Mission Control: Uncheck everything.

Once your spaces are shown on the upper part of the screen, you can just go over your diferent "spaces" with you mouse and then a cross will appear letting you shut down.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uqgla.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  hope this is helpful!  <answer228657> I did it this way In system preferences: Keyboard, unchecked the Mission control and the 3 below it and it turned it off.  <comment222844> @mikemaccana Thank you for the edit <comment373189> this is not working for Sierra
