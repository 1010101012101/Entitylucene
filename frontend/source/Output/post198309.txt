Apple Macbook Mid 2010 Ram Upgrade & Equipment & Windows Compatibility <body> Now I have 2 gb (1gb x2) as standard I want to upgrade it. "Hi-Level 4GB 1066MHz DDR3 Notebook Ram (HLV-SOPC8500D3/4G)" is it okay to be upgraded? and after I replaced that one with one of my standard ram should I dislocate the other one? I mean can I use 5 gb ram (4+1) ?   And my second question is about removing process. Which equipments I'll need? If it is not obligatory I don't want to buy as a kit. Could anybody name these equipments I need?  Finally, will 16 gb or 8 gb RAM work for windows (dual-boot) properly? (LAST QUESTION DID NOT ANSWERED YET)   <answer198311> This Apple Support document details what you need to remove and replace the RAM.  Using the wrong spec RAM can cause serious problems. The specs for the RAM are very specific: 204-pin PC3-8500 (1066MHz) DDR3 SO-DIMM  Apple spec is for max of 4GB RAM, but it use 16GB with Mac OS X 10.7.5 or later and the latest EFI firmware update.  DataMemorySystems has inexpensive RAM for this model.  Disclosure: I'm a satisfied customer of DataMemorySystems, as is my employer. We have purchased most, if not all of our RAM upgrades for hundreds of laptops &amp; desktops (Mac &amp; PC) from DataMem.  <answer198415> Your Macbook 2010 will be fine if you buy 2x8gb of 1066mHz DDR3. You will dual boot without issues. Correct ram speed is important, see my answer to a similar question here about possible issues with faster ram.  You will need Philips #00 screw to upgrade your memory. There is also a great guide at iFixit.  <comment237260> Thank you for you quick reply. 16 Gb with mac os x 10.7.5 or later okay got it but what about windows? Does this os also support 16gb or 8 gb ram? <comment237261> Windows? I don't understand. This is an Apple site. <comment237262> Dual boot I mean. I have mac os x as main os normally. It won't effect windows negative right? I think I'll buy that one if it is okay : http://www.datamemorysystems.com/dm50-223-1-x-2/ <comment237280> I have no practical experience with dual-boot stuff: I'm a Mac guy through and through. You should edit your question to include the dual-boot aspect of your situation and ask if all 16GB will be used by Windows. You should certainly purchase RAM that is compatible with the hardware. <comment237438> mid 2010 macbook pros (I assume 13') do not work with 16gb of ram. <comment237446> oups... The laptop looks different in the link you send me. Is there a possibility that laptop is not mid 2010? because mine is white and bottom cover is completely different. 7,1 is written in system information for me. Is it right? <comment237453> My mistake - you have the polycarbonate one - MacBook 7,1. (It's an almost identical to MacBook Pro 7,1. I have changed my answer and links to the correct article.
