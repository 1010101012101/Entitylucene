npm commain in Automator <body>  Hi, I would like to write an automator workflow which allows me to install node packages.  I tried with   code$ npm insall/code   but doesn't work any idea how I could solve this?   <answer205782> That's because when you run shell command from Automator, it's codePATH/code variable does have all the paths as when you run from Terminal. Use full path to npm executable. You can find the full path with codewhich npm/code in the Terminal.  <comment248112> That looks a shell command you ran. So how have you tried from automator and what were the errors <comment248146> `which` is an external command. In any posix shell, you can use either of the following builtin commands: `type npm` or `command -v npm` <comment248149> @fd0 I had `which` installed when I got the PC. :|
