How do I disable Cmd-D in Terminal? <body> kbdCmd/kbd-kbdD/kbd splits the terminal screen horizontally. How do I disable this "feature"? (Every time I accidentally this key, I have to undo it using kbdShift/kbd-kbdCmd/kbd-kbdD/kbd and then re-maximize the window).  This answer offers a command line which does not seem to change anything on OS X 10.11.6 (15G1004). Also, I would like a "permanent solution" - do I add the command to the code.bashrc/code? code.profile/code?  People also recommend iTerm2 - I do emnot/em want to install anything, I am quite happy with codetmux/code on top of the regular terminal - except for this stupid problem.  Thanks.  <answer254264> Assign a different key combination to codeTerminal/code’s codeSplit Pane/code menu item:  ol liQuit codeTerminal/code/li liOpen codeSystem Preferences/code/li liSelect the panel codeKeyboard/code from the second row/li liSelect the tab codeShortcuts/code at top center/li liSelect codeApp Shortcuts/code from the bottom of the list on the left/li liClick the code+/code button, bottom center and a smaller panel appears/li liIn the dropdown menu codeApplication:/code, select codeTerminal/code  ol liif Terminal isn’t on the list, scroll all the way to the bottom and select codeOther…/code (otherwise, skip to step 8 below)/li liwhen a dialog window appears, go to the folder codeUtilities/code and select codeTerminal/code/li /ol/li liIn the codeMenu Title:/code field, enter the text “codeSplit Pane/code” without quotation marks, but with capital letters “S” and “P”/li liIn the codeKeyboard Shortcut:/code field, enter your custom key combinationbr/Pro tips:  ol lifor a feature you hate, select a key combination you’ll never enter on accident, such as kbdcommand ⌘/kbd‑kbdcontrol ⌃/kbd‑kbdoption ⌥/kbd‑kbdshift ⇧/kbd‑kbdD/kbd/li liselect and hold down the modifier keys (that is, kbdcommand ⌘/kbd, kbdcontrol ⌃/kbd, kbdoption ⌥/kbd, and kbdshift ⇧/kbd) embefore/em you select the letter key (in this example, kbdD/kbd)/li /ol/li liClick codeAdd/code/li liRestart your Mac and fire up codeTerminal/code/li liBecome less unhappy /li /ol  <answer277794> Copy and paste into the terminal:  precodedefaults write com.apple.Terminal NSUserKeyEquivalents '{"Split Pane" = "@~^$d";}' /code/pre  This is equivalent to the GUI step-by-step instructions in the accepted answer.  Alas, those steps have to be done after every OS update, so a command line approach is a good idea.  <comment316482> Rebind the shortcut in keyboard preferences in system preferences? <comment316513> @JohnKeates: I tried. I can't find the place where the key is bound to something in terminal. I guess I can create a global binding for it, but I will need something completely harmless because I often hit cmd-d instead of alt-d. <comment349905> It's not necessary to quit Terminal in order to make this change.
