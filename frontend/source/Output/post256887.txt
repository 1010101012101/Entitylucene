Can't revert document, permission denied <body> When closing an edited document there are 3 options: 'Revert changes' - 'Cancel' - 'Save'. 'Cancel' and 'Save' works fine but every time I click on 'Revert changes' there is message "Operation can't be completed. Permission denied".  I downloaded Cocktail app to fix the permission on the HDD but still didnt help. Anyone knows how to fix this issue?
