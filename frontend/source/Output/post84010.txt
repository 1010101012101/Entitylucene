DHCP server settings not loading <body> I’m trying to activate a DHCP server using Server.app but all I get is an empty window "Loading…" and a spinning wheel "Getting service state…" which spins forever. All other services seem to run without problems (except for the spinning wheel which somehow often does not stop spinning). How would I go about troubleshooting this problem?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WDDkC.png" alt="Server DHCP window"  <answer84012> Apparently, Server.app messed up code/etc/bootpd.plist/code by inserting a code&lt;/dict&gt;/code in the middle of the configuration.
