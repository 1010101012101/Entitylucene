Synchronize only selected Google contacts on iphone <body> Following these instructions, I was able to synchronize all my Google contacts to iOS.  However, this bundled together emall/em my Google contacts: people without phone numbers, people I haven't communicated with in years, etc... I was hoping to see only my frequent contacts list.  Is it possible to only synchronize a selected group of contacts on the iphone? Alternatively, can I only emshow/em a few of the groups, as is possible with iCloud contact groups?
