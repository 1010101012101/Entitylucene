Load .bash_profile automatically on Terminal.app startup? <body> I have seen various questions that ask something similar. They suggest changing code.bash_profile/code to code.profile/code. However this doesn't work either.  I have aliases setup up in code.bash_profile/code. I would like these to be available automatically every time I open Terminal.app. Instead, I currently have to run the file manually each time I open Terminal.   Please advise on how this can be run automatically each time terminal starts.  <answer83738> The FILES section in the man page for bash says that code~/.bashrc/code is executed at the start of every interactive shell while code~/.bash_profile/code is executed for login shells only.  <comment96363> Welcome to the site! The guide on [Ask] will help you refine your question by showing what you've tried and/or what exactly "you don't get". If you don't get a good answer, feel free to try editing in some details or links on what question you used and what step is failing or doesn't make sense. We love details here. <comment264196> If renaming `~/.bash_profile` to `~/.profile` works, then one isn't using Bash. Bash will run either of those. If only `~/.profile` is run, one is almost certainly using some other shell that doesn't know about the bash-specific file. <comment264197> Voted to close. The symptom has too many possible causes, and the OP hasn't responded or been active for over two years.
