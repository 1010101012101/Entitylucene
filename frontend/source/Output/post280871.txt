How do I play or share a voice memo? <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/l8E9x.png" alt="enter image description here"  I can't play this voice memo. It won't play. I also can't share it.   iOS 10.3.1  <answer280874> I hear this happens when the app crashes mid-recording. Does it pop up when you try to sync the voice recording with iTunes?   You could try extracting it with a program like iExplorer. Find it under the 'recordings' folder.
