Unset iTerm as the https:// handler <body> I made iTerm the default handler for a number of protocols that it doesn't know how to handle. How can I unset these protocols? And how can I set them to be handled by Chrome?  So far I have tried removing the value from these protocols in this file:     open ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices.plist   But this hasn't worked. iTerm is still handling these protocols.  <answer202943> Download and install RCDefault and change all URLs associated to iTerm2 to their proper apps, especially https.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/S9xqn.png" alt="enter image description here"  To unset iTerm2 handling particular URLs open the Apps tab, navigate to iTerm2 and untick those URLs.  <comment244783> You are a life saver.
