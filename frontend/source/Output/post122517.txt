K.W.  <answer122520> You'd have to set Soundflower as the default output for audio (System Preferences-Sound), otherwise it will only accept input from whichever program has been specifically set to send output to Soundflower. Then in AU Lab, select Soundflower as the default input. This should capture everything.
