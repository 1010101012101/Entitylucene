A New Balance data base appears every time I use Safari. <body> Every time I use Safari, I find a New Balance data base listed.  I have never knowingly signed up for this data base.  Every time I log off from Safari I delete this data base but it reappears every time I use Safari.  How can I get rid of this data base once and for all?  <comment374438> I suggest you look at the URL saved in Safari Preferences  General  Homepage to see if it contains the link to this database. <comment374441> I'd do what @IconDaemon suggested. However, if this doesn't resolve the issue, can you edit your question to clarify what you mean by *I find a New Balance data base listed*? In particular what you mean by listed?
