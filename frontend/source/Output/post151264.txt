Warn before quitting in Safari <body> Is it possible to activate some safety check, like "Warn Before Quitting" in Chrome, to quit Safari? Sometimes we can press kbd⌘/kbdkbdQ/kbd by mistake, and it's a pain to have the entire application closed.  <answer151267> My tweak is to use BetterTouchTools and set kbd⌘/kbdkbdQ/kbd to run the following script:  precodetell application "System Events"     set theName to name of the first process whose frontmost is true end tell tell application theName     display dialog "Are you sure you want to quit?"     quit end tell /code/pre  This works fine, but it isn't neat.  hr  A few more detailed steps for newbies:  ul liOpen up script editor, paste the script above, save anywhere safe as something like "quit script"/li liOpen up BetterTouchTool, go to the Keyboard section, /li liSelect Global for ALL apps or Safari (or whatever app) for just that one/li liRecord a Cmd+Q as the keystroke/li liIn the perform action popup, search for 'script' and choose the 'launch app/script' choice./li linow select your script file. /li liviola! /li /ul  <answer217879> Fabio's answer seems not to works as expected, not sure if I have a different version of BTT, or osx. Anyway, I found another option: simply bind Quit Safari with another keybinding.  Go to system preferences - Keyboard - Shortcuts - App Shortcuts - Add new one ('+' sign) - Choose Safari from the Application menu - Enter in the Menu Title the exact text: Quit Safari - Set another shortcut than cmd-Q, I used ^-cmd-Q (option+command+q). img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/D1V4M.png" alt="Snapshot"  If you do want quit Safari, you can use this shortcut, or quit from the menu.  <answer242469> I have a quick solution for users who own Keyboard Maestro. The key idea is to prevent quitting the application when the codeCommand + Key/code is pressed, and allow quitting application when you hold the key combination for a specific amount of time.

Chrome and Opera both provide this option (not sure about Firefox since I seldom use it). The loss is too great when I have typed ten paragraphs and accidentally hit Command Q (some websites with text fields do not warn before closing tabs). I actually began to like Safari 8 and am moving more and more of my browsing to Safari (before Yosemite I never gave it a s**t); but this, coupled with other missing features (e.g. prompt for each download) is still preventing Safari from becoming my default.
