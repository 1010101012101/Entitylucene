Does FaceTime work if I purchase my iPhone in Saudi Arabia then move countries? <body> I purchased an iPhone 6 with FaceTime from Saudi Arabia. Can I use FaceTime while I am India because someone told me that if you purchase an iPhone in Saudi Arabia the FaceTime does not work anywhere.  <answer172104> This blog-post claims, strongselecting a different country in the settings while setting up your account/strong already does the trick. But since the article is from 2010, it may not apply to iOS8: http://www.macgasm.net/2010/10/23/facetime-saudi-arabia-workaround/  YouTube video about iOS 8 and Facetime, based on a jailbroken device using Cydia: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6QSRN3NUec  It's a shame Apple bends down to those regimes and prunes down key functionality. Clearly shows that iMessage / Facetime encryption works (as long as you trust Apple).  You might want to look into Signal (encrypted audio calls, Instant messaging should be coming in first half of 2015): https://itunes.apple.com/app/signal-private-messenger/id874139669?mt=8  Hope this helps!
