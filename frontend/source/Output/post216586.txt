How to completely remove Fuse for Mac OS X NTFS-3G <body> I have problem with the removing of NTFS-3G. These instructions say:     If you have followed those instructions then you've installed three   packages.      fuse_wait just replaces a single file of the NTFS-3G install with an   updated version. So you don't really need to do anything to uninstall   this package; when you remove NTFS-3G it should automatically remove   that updated version.      To remove NTFS-3G either open the NTFS-3G preference pane and click on   the Uninstall button, or run the script at   /System/Library/Filesystems/ntfs-3g.fs/Support/uninstall-ntfs-3g.sh.      To uninstall FUSE for OS X open the FUSE for OS X system preference   pane and click the Uninstall button.      If the two preference panes are still there after running both   uninstalls, then just right-click on them and select the "Remove ...   Preference Pane" option.      And reboot your Mac.      To confirm that the file are gone you could run the following commands   in Terminal. Hopefully you shouldn't get any results.      pkgutil --pkgs | grep fuse  kextstat | grep fuse   But when i run "pkgutil --pkgs | grep fuse", i always get the result "com.github.bfleischer.pkg.fuse_wait". How can i solve this?  <answer223998> I don't think this is a problem.  The codepkgutil/code command is just telling you that the strongfuse_wait/strong package has been installed on your Mac. If this is the only result from that command then it means the other fuse packages have been uninstalled, and since the fuse_wait installer only replaces one file in the fuse install that file has likely been removed from your Mac.  Also if you are running the codekextstat | grep fuse/code command from the linked answer and getting no results then it further confirms that strongfuse/strong is no longer running as part of your Mac.
