Microsoft Word cannot copy or paste <body> I use a MacBookPro 2012 with 4GB ram. My Word 16 used to work perfectly but recently the Copy and Paste function hasn't been working properly. If I copied a text (from a PDF or any other application) into Word, it would not work. Only if I used the special paste function did it work.  Second, when I copy words in the Doc file into other applications, rather than pasting the contents from the Word Documents into that other application, it does nothing. When I copy contents from a word Document it is only compatible with other word documents. If it is not a Word.app file, it does not copy.  <comment331282> Do you use the right-click menu to copy-paste? <comment331285> I use the Cmd C and Cmd V
