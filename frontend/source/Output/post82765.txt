How to determine which traffic goes over the PPTP VPN? <body> I setup a PPTP VPN on mac os x lion, on the advanced tab I do not have the send all traffic over VPN connection checked. I only want traffic to a specific server connected to go through the vpn, everything else should not be sent over the vpn.  Where do I look to find out which IP addresses will be included for traffic over the vpn and which ones will not?  <answer84243> Have you tried using the route command to declare a static route?  For instance, I use the following with my VPN:  precodesudo route -v -net 10.41.0.0 -netmask 255.255.0.0 -interface ppp0 /code/pre  This tells any traffic going to 10.41.x.x to go over the VPN interface (ppp0).  <answer200874> I had to add codeadd/code to your command for it to work on OS X.  First, connect your vpn and find the interface name: codeifconfig/code. Mine was also ppp0. Then run: codesudo route -v add -net 10.41.0.0 -netmask 255.255.0.0 -interface ppp0/code.   code-net/code is a modifier on the codeadd/code command.  Works like a charm.
