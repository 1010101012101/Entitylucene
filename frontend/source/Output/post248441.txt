Removing packages previously installed by Homebrew <body> So I uninstalled emHomebrew/em, and didn't remove the packages previously installed by codebrew/code. Is there any way to remove these packages? Without codebrew list/code returning anything I don't know where to begin with removing them. I stored a list of the packages so I know which ones to look for but don't know where to find them.  Here's the list:     ul   liautoconf/li   lifreetype/li   lijasper/li   lilibtasn1/li   limpfr/li   lisane-backends/li   liautomake/li   ligcc/li   lijpeg    /li   lilibtiff/li   linettle/li   lisqlite/li   liboost/li   ligd/li   likakoune/li   lilibtool     /li   linode        /li   litmux/li   licarthage    /li   ligdbm        /li   lilibevent    /li   lilibusb  /li   liopenblas/li   litree/li   lichromedriver    /li   ligit /li   lilibgpg-error/li   lilibusb-compat   /li   liopenssl /li   liunixodbc/li   licscope  /li   ligmp     /li   lilibgphoto2  /li   lilibyaml /li   lipkg-config/li   liwget/li   lielasticsearch   /li   lignutls      /li   lilibicns     /li   lilittle-cms2 /li   lipypy3       /li   liwine/li   lielixir      /li   lihttpie      /li   lilibksba     /li   limakedepend/li   lipython  /li   liwxmac/li   lierlang      /li   lihub     /li   lilibmpc      /li   limicro       /li   lipython3     /li   lixz/li   lifontconfig  /li   liisl/li   lilibpng/li   limongodb/li   lireadline/li   lizeromq/li   limercurial/li   /ul   <answer248449> All packages installed by homebrew should be located in code/usr/local/Cellar//code I think you can simply remove them from there.  <comment307824> What steps or script did you use to uninstall? The tool has been around for a while, so there are different versions of the uninstaller. The good news is /usr/loca/ contains all the files in almost all cases. <comment307894> Don't forget the symlinks in `/usr/local/bin` and possibly stuff in `/usr/local/etc` and possibly others. There is also a cache somewhere in `/Library/Cache` I think. <comment307919> For the uninstaller I ran: `/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/uninstall)"` <comment307920> `/usr/local/Cellar/` doesn't exist for me :( <comment308258> @Souljacker try ``` which jasper``` for example and that will tell you the path where the bin is installed.
