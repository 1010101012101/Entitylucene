Reduced data usage when using YouTube in background? <body> As I understand it, it's possible to listen to YouTube audio in the background, by playing it from the safari app, on iOS devices. What I wonder: does doing this reduce the bandwidth, the amount of data because solely audio (and no video) is being output?  <answer140780> No, even though you're only listening to the audio, the video will continue to be streamed to the device.
