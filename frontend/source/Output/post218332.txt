Iphone 6, 9.1 iOS, Sync problem <body> Just upgraded to an iPhone 6 from the 4s, as soon as I plugged it into my computer to re-sync all of my music it gave me an update to 9.1. After the update I began to sync my music only to have maybe 11/274 songs actually work. It says the name of them on my phone but they're all grayed out and I can't play them. The phone keeps connecting/disconnecting from my computer without me touching the cord. I also don't have the latest version of iTunes if that makes a difference. Some help would be nice idk if this is user error or software error.   <comment263928> Can you change the title please.  It has no relation to your topic now. <comment263930> That's three questions in one. SE works best when there is one question to answer. Fix the 2nd one first - try another cable, then update iTunes, then see http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/90305/greyed-out-songs-when-trying-to-add-from-itunes-to-iphone?rq=1
