Why large size calculation difference: Mac Finder vs du? <body> I have just noticed that for some of my directories on an external disk there is a huge difference in calculated size depending on whether I use the GUI Finder or codedu/code (or rather codedu -h/code). Using Finder on this directory I get 145 GB, whereas codedu/code gives me 135 GB. That is a difference of 10 GB! Checking another directory I (on my local machine) I get 41 vs 43,7. So there seems to be almost a 10% difference here. Can anyone explain this?  <answer147909> I'm not entirely sure but 145GB is exactly 135 GiB so I think Finder gives result with decimal prefixes while codedu/code uses the binary ones.br See this article  <comment174349> See also http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/83412/difference-between-du-and-finder-file-sizes <comment174488> That must be it -- very informative (and convincing) article reference as well. Thanks! <comment174588> @Rnhmjoj This happened to me as well, but I tried googling "122.13 GB in GiB" (my home folder file size according to Finder) and I get 113.742 GiB. However `du` gives me 161G. <comment174621> @Arc676 I made a search and `du -kh`should count files by 1024 byte blocks. So what I thought is correct but there must be also something else. I can't figure out.
