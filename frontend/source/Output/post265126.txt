Apple Watch won't unlock MacBook Pro unless watch is restarted <body> My issue is unlocking my Mac with the Apple Watch feature. I've read where turning off the watch and phone will then in turn allow me to unlock my Mac.  This works, the problem is, I have to do this every single day.  Since enabling this feature, I haven't gone two days in a row without having to restart my watch/phone to be able to use this feature.  Once I do this, the feature works great all day.  But it's very frustrating to have to do this on a daily basis.  Note: I turn my Mac off at night and turn in on in the morning at work. Anyone else having this same problem, or know of a fix?

There's many questions here about using the Watch to unlock the Mac and most of them are because it wasn't setup correctly to start, so I wanted to eliminate that as part of the problem. <comment334453> I'm hoping it will no longer be slower than typing my password or using Knock.  Because up until now both of those are MUCH faster options <comment334463> I'm just hoping I type an answer too soon.  It better continue working tomorrow also!! <comment334465> *didn't type an ...
