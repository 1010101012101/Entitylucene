iOS Developer Account With VISA Debit Card <body> Can anyone confirm whether Apple accepts VISA debit card to buy iOS Developer account that costs $99.  I can use the same card to purchase apps from the App Store but is this card can also be used to buy iOS developer account?  <answer92143> According to Apple iOS Developer website, only valid credit cards are accepted. Googling suggest attempted purchase using debit card didn't work, unfortunately.  <answer92280> I've used debit cards for years. But I'm in Europe, where debit cards are standard; it's possible that things are different in the US.  <answer142532> I have just used VISA Debit card which works for me :)  Form says credit card details and however debit card works.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XV6cc.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer247626> Debit cards with "Verified by Visa" or "3D SecureCode" will failed on international transactions.   Please use any debit cards without these verification steps in order to bypass the USSD command to send you the verification code to your phone.   <comment108258> Good point. @AJ112, are you in Europe, US, or elsewhere? <comment305575> Just don't tell this to all the online stores I frequently buy stuff at with such a card :-)
