Playing Music while recording? <body> So I'm having the issue; How can I play music on iOS 7 while recording?  I've seen this post but "JamCam" isn't something I'm interested in.  Is there a Cydia tweak which allows this? I'm surprised I can't find it on Google!  <answer226020> You can try with this app: Record And Listen  This app solves the problem of not being able to record a video while playing music from your library. You choose a song and record a video which is automatically saved to your phone. This app is great for taking dance videos, or if you just want to continue playing your music while taking a video. Price is 0.99$.  <answer270633> Check out Media Monster I use this, you can record video unlimited with music playing at all times. Very easy to use compared to the ones.  <answer295080> You can also try Relish - Record, Listen, Shine  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofdy-CEDsmA
