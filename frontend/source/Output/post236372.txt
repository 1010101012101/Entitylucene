How to prevent mail app from marking e-mails from VIP as spam <body> I set someone's e-mail address as VIP, but lately his e-mails end up in the junk folder. Is there any way in the mail app to prevent a certain address's e-mails to be marked as junk?  <answer236376> First, make sure this person is in your Contacts, including the email address you want to mark as not being spam.  This is important because Mail checks there when determining what's spam.  Then, go to the codeMail --&gt; Preferences/code, codeJunk Mail/code tab, and make sure the following options are checked:  ul liEnable Junk Mail Filtering/li liChoose codeMark as junk mail, but leave it in my Inbox/code/li liThe Following Types of Messages are exempt from Junk Mail Filtering:  ul licodeSender of message is in my Contacts/code/li licodeSender of message is in my Previous Recipients/code/li licodeMessage is addressed using my full name/code/li liAlso select codeTrust junk mail headers in messages/code/li /ul/li /ul  After you do all this, Mail might still put some email in Spam/Junk.  Just right-click on the email and select codeNot junk mail/code.  It's not perfect but eventually it should learn.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KAkyY.jpg" alt="enter image description here"
