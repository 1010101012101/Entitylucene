Remove auto suggestion for usernames <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7v2xl.png" alt="enter image description here"  How do I remove this function?  <answer286087> It's up to the website to disable autocorrect on fields. You can disable autocorrect globally: go to System Preferences → Keyboard → Text and uncheck ‘Correct spelling automatically’.  Instead of disabling it, you can click the × to cancel that correction, and once you've done that a few times, the word will be added to the dictionary and won't be autocorrected.
