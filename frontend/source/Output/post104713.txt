Change Ctrl+Arrow and Ctrl+Shift+Arrow to jump/jump+select a single word rather than the whole line? <body> In order to change the way kbdhome/kbd and kbdend/kbd function on OS X so it matches other devices I frequently utilised this 'hack'. Is there a similar way to override the way kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdarrow/kbd and kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbdarrow/kbd work?  I appreciate that if I was completely moving to OS X it's silly, however, when all other devices use these keys in this fashion it makes sense to reconfigure them on the one device that doesn't match.  In short, I want to make kbdctrl/kbd+kbdleft/right arrow/kbd jump by word/punctuation separator as it does on Ubuntu and Windows rather than to the end of line.  I would prefer to use a native override rather than installing an app to perform this task, but if that's not possible then please let me know of any apps.  <answer104749> Create code~/Library/KeyBindings//code and save a property list like this as codeDefaultKeyBinding.dict/code:  precode{   "^\UF702" = moveWordLeft:;   "^\UF703" = moveWordRight:;   "^$\UF702" = moveWordLeftAndModifySelection:;   "^$\UF703" = moveWordRightAndModifySelection:; } /code/pre  Then quit and reopen applications to apply the changes.

Though like I said above, I want to have the same functionality as other operating systems.
