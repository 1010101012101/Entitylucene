One of three monitors does not start after upgrading from Lion to Mountain Lion <body> I've just updated to OS X 10.8.2 (earlier 10.7.5) on my Mac Pro. And I have 3 monitors - DVI, DisplayPort (primary), DVI; attached to 6850. Everything works fine, but every time I start the computer, the primary monitor remains off.  This can be fixed manually re-connecting the DisplayPort cable.  I did not have such issue while being on 10.7.5.  How can I get rid of this behavior with software changes?  <comment92966> Nobody knows now? :(
