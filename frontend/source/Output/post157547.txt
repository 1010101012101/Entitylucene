JDK 7 on mac 10.6.2 (32bits) <body> I want to install JDK version 7 on my mac Snow leopard 10.6.2 (32bits).  How can I do it ? Pleas give me some help ? is it possible or not ?  <answer157549> Oracle is only supporting Java 7 on Mac OS X 10.7 and above.  However, there is a possible solution/answer on our sister site here.  Or visit Adobe help here.  But, I am not sure it is possible at all on 32 bit, so consider if your system can support 64 bit.  <answer157553> I have tested this solution, and when I install jdk version 7, the installation is failed. And when I go into em/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_72/Contents/Home/bin/java/em in order to run java it return strongBad CPU type in executable/strong.  Is the problem because I have a mac with 32bits?  <answer157555> Java 7 and Java 8 is only available in a 64-bit version on OS X, and therefor it can only be installed on a 64-bit Mac.  <comment185263> You may have to consider using a Virtual Machine (VMWare, Virtual Box) and use another OS on it? <comment185267> Please do not use answers for follow-up questions; edit your original question instead or if a new one arises, ask a new one. In this case though, your OS version is simply not supported.
