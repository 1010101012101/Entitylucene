MacBook hard drive formatting <body> I removed Filevault to resize the main partition. I had about 320 GB of data on my hard drive so I tried to reduce this partition. The partition wouldn't budge so I closed emDisk Utility/em and shut down the computer. It wouldn't shut down properly so I forced it to shut down. Now that I have started the computer again the hard drive is said as having 586 GB of data.  I want to know what all this extra data is and how do I get rid of it. I really need the extra space to double boot it.  emEdit/em The output of the commands given:  precodejamess-MacBook-Pro:~ james$ diskutil list /dev/disk0    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *750.2 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            749.3 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3   jamess-MacBook-Pro:~ james$ diskutil cs list No CoreStorage logical volume groups found   jamess-MacBook-Pro:~ james$ df  Filesystem    512-blocks       Used Available Capacity   iused    ifree %iused  Mounted on /dev/disk0s2  1463469952 1093708872 369249080    75% 136777607 46156135   75%   / devfs                379        379         0   100%       657        0  100%   /dev map -hosts             0          0         0   100%         0        0  100%  /net map auto_home          0          0         0   100%         0        0  100%   /home map -hosts             0          0         0   100%         0        0  100%   /hosts /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OpjGE.png" alt="About this mac storage page" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DSMTm.png" alt="Command line responses"  <answer217282> I restarted in recovery (command + R) and repaired the disk which appeared to return it to its original state, I am now retrying to format the disk   <comment262663> The question as it stands now is hardly answerable. Please add the output of `diskutil list`, `diskutil cs list` and `df` entered in Terminal.app and/or a screenshot of *About Your Mac* which show the occupied space of your main volume. <comment262664> Well it's probably messed up data from turning of FileVault. After doing a Disk-based task, you should really properly shut it off. <comment262665> it was refusing to turn off, the screen was black and had the spinning circle <comment262668> is there any way of clearing any items that may have been left behind. If there is a place they would be placed or anything i may need to delete <comment262676> @JamesTompkins Well a spinning circle on a black screen indicates it's turning off. If it was taking a while, it would've needed to properly unmount the disk. Look in `/tmp` and see if there's anything extra. I'd also go to disk utility and verify your disk.
