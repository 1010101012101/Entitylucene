Which are the default settings of the key repeat rate? <body> I tried adjusting my repeat rate for the keyboard, on Snow Leopard, by using the following:  precodedefaults write NSGlobalDomain KeyRepeat -int 0 defaults write NSGlobalDomain InitialKeyRepeat -int 7 /code/pre  I wish to set the InitialKeyRepeat value to its default setting, how could I go about doing that? Could someone check and let me know the value of the InitialKeyRepeat they are using?  Thanks  <answer56531> precodedefaults delete NSGlobalDomain KeyRepeat defaults delete NSGlobalDomain InitialKeyRepeat /code/pre  and reboot.
