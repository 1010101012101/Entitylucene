To-Do list which could read the task on time <body> I'm looking for the application for OS X (Maverick), which could merge two tasks for me.  One is the TO-DO list just like "Reminders". The second one is more tricky - I wish "Reminders" to read task on loud as soon as the task will be close to specific time frame.  I use similar functionality in the OSX's clock, which tells me each 15 minutes what time is it.  Do you have any suggestions?   <comment143719> Are you looking for an OS X app or an iOS app? <comment144192> @grgarside, I'm looking for the OSX app.
