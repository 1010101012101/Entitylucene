Unknown tag in finder <body> I have an external SSD which i used on my previous mac. The SSD had couple of files tagged in various colours (green, red etc)  When i moved to new MAC, the files still retain their colours and is not corresponding to new mac, though the colours are same.  Green was from my old MAC, and I have no option of removing it from my new one.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qh7n0.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer181633> If the files you have issues with are self-created simple files like the text file you depicted, you can run a Terminal command on those files to clear out specific or all extended attributes.  This will effectively remove ANY tag you attached previously.  Once done, you can re-attach tags in the fashion you already know.  Keep in mind that some applications may use extended attributes to complement the data inside a file.  So, deleting all attributes is not always the best idea.  For simple (text/image) files, it should be ok however.  Here are the commands to clear the responsible extended attributes:  precodexattr -d com.apple.FinderInfo /drag/your/file/from/Finder/here xattr -d com.apple.metadata:_kMDItemUserTags /drag/your/file/from/Finder/here /code/pre  Here is the command for clearing ALL extended attributes on a given file:  precodexattr -c /drag/your/file/from/Finder/here /code/pre  To know what extended attributes are attached to a file, you can run the following command in Terminal to list them:  precodels -ld@ /drag/your/file/from/Finder/here /code/pre  Output from that last command will look something like this:  precodedrwxr-xr-x@ 2 youruser  staff  68 Apr 19 14:28 /your/file/from/Finder/here     com.apple.FinderInfo    32      com.apple.metadata:_kMDItemUserTags 52  /code/pre  <comment215974> Did you try just right clicking the file & removing the green tag? The names don't have to match <comment216115> Thank you so much. It worked well to remove the tag. <comment216117> In addition to this, I have raised a new issue on this. http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/181704/tags-not-associated-in-mac-os-x
