Change default applications <body> I have somehow managed to replace the default movie player, with my FTP client. I'm not sure how that happened, but now every time I double click a movie file in Finder, my FTP client launches.  Can someone tell me how I can go about changing the default application that launches for certain file extensions?  <answer84141> Select a video file, press âŒ˜I, change the application under Open with, and select Change All.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VYw3Q.png" alt=""  You can also use duti to configure default applications in a text file.
