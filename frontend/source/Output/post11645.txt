How can I use Nike+ with roller skates? <body> Is it possible to use Nike+ with rollerblade skates? How?  <answer11646> Nike+ is a step counter, so it's measuring steps. With rollerblades you're not stepping usually.  You can try to calibrate your device with your moves of your rollerblades, but I don't think it will measure it correctly.  <comment37737> You might be better with one of the GPS based training apps. <comment42415> Actually the new Nike+ App is GPS based (Called Nike+ GPS) - so no problem if you got an iOS device with GPS: http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nike-gps/id387771637?mt=8
