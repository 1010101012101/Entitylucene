Need to regularly check windows for changes <body> I'm looking for a fast and reliable method to monitor changes in some windows belonging to a application.  After I hit a hotkey I'd like a method to monitor those windows for a change in specific pixels, and if it detect any changes it should trigger an action (more specifically move that window to other coordinates).  I've got a copy of Keyboard Maestro, which could be certainly a help. Also GrabFS may help.  What's the best way to achieve my goals?  <answer189640> PixelPeeper is the only OS X app i've found that comes close to achieving this goal. Unfortunately it only watches a single pixel and has no adjustments for sensitivity.  I too wish to find an app to monitor multiple specific regions of the screen and activate a script when significant changes occur.
