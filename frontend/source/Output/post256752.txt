Where can I find the OS X installer? <body> Everything I've seen says get it from the App Store, but when I search the App Store I get 'nothing found'.  I am trying to build a USB boot stick on one old 15" MacBook Pro for an even older 17" MacBook Pro.

There is no software download for OS X Snow Leopard. You need to find the install disk, buy a new install disk, or take your laptop to an Apple Store, where they will reinstall the OS for free.  <comment320299> What version of the OS are you looking for? <comment320302> Whatever version will run on this machine. <comment320304> No other way? What if I don't need the latest OS? <comment320307> Then you'll need an older install disk. Easiest thing to do is take it to an Apple Store if there's one nearby. If not, the install disks go for ~$10 on eBay. <comment320309> Are you sure they'll install it for free at an Apple Store? It was originally a paid upgrade, and I don't think that ever changed. On the other hand, you can apparently still order discs from [Apple online](http://www.apple.com/shop/product/MC573Z/A/mac-os-x-106-snow-leopard) for $19.99. <comment320312> @GordonDavisson Yes they'll do it for free. I went in to my local Apple store twice for them to do it on an old 2006 Mac Mini I had.
