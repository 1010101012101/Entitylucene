How to make "say" command speak AND output to the file at the same time <body> When using the codesay/code command I can give it an option code-o (file name)/code for it to record to a file. However, that suppresses the audio output.  Is there a way to make it do both in one command?  <answer201319> It appears difficult or impossible with the built-in codesay/code command.  You may be able to redirect the audio from codesay/code into a listening AUNetSend that in turn writes to disk and plays the audio; see Audio Hijack below.  h1espeak and ffplay/h1  You can use the open source codeespeak/code and codeffplay/code tools to achieve this. The following command both says "Hello world" and creates a code.wav/code file of the recording:  precodeespeak --stdout "hello world" | tee -a hello.wav | ffplay -i - /code/pre  The command combines three tools:  ul licodeespeak/code converts the text into audio./li licodetee/code is used to divert a copy of codestdout/code to a file./li licodeffplay/code plays the audio./li /ul  codeespeak/code can read from a file or web page using the codef/code flag:  precodeespeak --stdout -f myfile.txt | tee -a myfile.wav | ffplay -i - /code/pre  Another tool such as codeffmpeg/code or iTunes can be used to convert the codewav/code file to an MP3 or AAC file.  h2Install/h2  To install espeak and ffplay, use HomeBrew or MacPorts. With HomeBrew set up, the install command is:  precodebrew install espeak ffmpeg /code/pre  h1Audio Hijack/h1  Alternatively, a good option is to use a third party tool like Audio Hijack:     Record any audio, with Audio Hijack! Save audio from applications like iTunes, Skype or Safari, or from hardware devices like microphones and mixers.   This screen shot shows Audio Hijack taking output from Skype, recording to disk and playing back through the speaker.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kTUHn.png" alt="Audio Hijack splitting audio"  <comment242662> Thanks for the great extensive answer! I'm trying to do something very specific with the say command though. <comment242663> Then Audio Hijack and routing through the `AUNetSend` module is likely your best option. Good luck.
