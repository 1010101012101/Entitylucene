File browser alternatives with remote connections <body> I have been linux person for 6 years, now converting to mac world.   I am looking for the file browser, which would enable me to:  ul lidelete files and folders by pressing delete/li lirename files by shortcut or right mouse button/li lienter folders by pressing "Enter"/li linavigating in the tree by shortcuts (keyboard only)/li /ul  and also importantly:  ul lido the same things on REMOTE linux servers, especially edit files on the fly/li liopen remote text files in my favorite editor (whichever I want, such as Sublime)/li /ul  In Ubuntu, I just typed to the directory address ssh://name@server and file system acted completely the same way as if I was on the local computer. Perfectly easy to use and understand.  I don't mind paying small/medium amount of money if needed.  <answer101850> You can use sshfs or Transmit to mount SSH locations as local volumes.  ↩ renames files in Finder. ⌘↓ or ⌘O opens files, ⌘⌫ moves files to the trash, and ⌥⌘V moves files copied with ⌘C.  You could also take a look at Forklift or Path Finder. Both support making return open files but not making forward delete move files to to the trash.  <comment120087> a little off topic, but... how is it you don't have a username?
