What does "CMD + <" do in AZERTY keyboard? <body> What does kbdCMD/kbd+kbd&lt;/kbd do in AZERTY keyboard layout? I'm trying to assign it to a program using apptivate, but it keeps telling me it is already assigned to a system-wide shortcut.   I've been looking around in the keyboard prefpane, but nothing uses this shortcut yet. I've also tried to use the shortcut in many different applications, but most of the time it does absolutely nothing, with an occasional error beep.  What can I do?  <answer13248> the shortcut is meant to go to settings of what ever program is running in the foreground (it will be the program in the upper left corner of your screen). However you can customize your shortcut settings in System Preferences  Keyboard  Keyboard shortcuts  <answer13254> On my Swedish system, kbdCMD/kbd-kbd&lt;/kbd switches between windows in the same application, at least for some applications.  <comment13973> how are you listing the shortcut?
