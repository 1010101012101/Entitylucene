Upgraded to iPhone 7 from 6S and updated to iOS10.2.1. Text messages are showing incorrect contact sometimes. <body> I just upgraded phones and synced from a (same-day) backup on my computer of my old phone. I immediately updated to the latest iOS software (10.2.1).  Now some text messages for new and existing threads show a contact name (from my address book), but that's not the contact / phone number from the thread.  If I tap on te name to see the thread, the name at the top changes to the correct contact.  If I click the info icon from there, I also see the correct contact and phone number.  I return to the text messages list screen and see another person's name.    This has happened to me twice now that I have noticed on two separate text threads.
