How to disable ._ AppleDouble files for SMB? <body> I have a small problem. I don't want that our Macs here create the code._/code files to the network drive. For example when you copy an image over the finder to the SMB storage.  Is there a way to disable this function in Finder?   The code.DS_Store/code file is already disabled, but not files such as code._pic1.jpg/code .  We activated veto files in samba to prevent creation of code._/code files, there arose an error – not enough permissions on the drive.  Thank to all ;)  <answer7131> Don't know of a way within Finder, but Blue Harvest (paid application) offers this functionality: http://www.zeroonetwenty.com/blueharvest4/  <answer57832> h1Finder/h1  Finder does much to ensure integrity of data, and to make its results compatible with a broad range of Apple operating systems.   Please, you should strongnot attempt to prevent Finder/strong from creating code._/code (dot underscore) files during copy or move routines.   h1File system/h1  If you prevent creation at the file system level – as you did with your configuration of Samba – you make that file system partially incompatible with at least:   ul liApple Finder/li liMicrosoft Office Excel, PowerPoint and Word 2011./li /ul  (For any use case that involves Office 2011 saving to a file system, you must allow code._/code on that file system … and so on.)  hr  For more detail please see my answer to a more recent question, Why are dot underscore ._ files created, and how can I avoid them?:   ul liPurposes of .DS_Store and ._ files/li /ul  <comment7608> possible duplicate of [How do I stop OS X from writing Spotlight and Trash files to memory cards and USB sticks?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/6707/how-do-i-stop-os-x-from-writing-spotlight-and-trash-files-to-memory-cards-and-usb) <comment66533> More recent, with an accepted answer: [Prevent Apple Double Format Files on Remote Share/Disk](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/20389/8546) <comment66566> Thx. The post is a bit older and there is no way to prevent it. I have made a script which delete this files.
