Nsurl error domain (1012) subscribing MDM Server <body> I'm trying to strongmanage iPads/strong with an own strongMDM-server/strong. I configured the ProfileManagement but it doesn't work (anymore).. I always get an strongNsurl error domain 2012/strong when trying to prepare the iPad (on the device). I searched a lot on the internet.. It seems to be with https? Certificates? But nothing specific for Profile Manager / MDM.  So I don't have any idea what to do right now.  I'm preparing the iPads with Apple Configurator 2 (Version 2.2). I created a blueprint with the following settings for MDM:  ul listrongConfiguration/strong: Manual/li listrongServer/strong: https://mdmserver.domainname.be/devicemanagement/mdm/dep_mdm_enroll (When I visit this URL in the browser, I get 405 Method Not Supported : GET)/li li.../li /ul  There are a lot of certificates for the server, and maybe its because they aren't the good ones..  I don't have any Certificate for https://domainname.be..  Certificates of the server: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WYjUs.png" alt="Certificates Server"  macServer  Messages (APN) (VPP appleid added):  precodemdmserver.domainname.be - apns:com.apple.calendar mdmserver.domainname.be - apns:com.apple.contact mdmserver.domainname.be - apns:com.apple.mail mdmserver.domainname.be - apns:com.apple.mgmt mdmserver.domainname.be - apns:com.apple.alerts /code/pre  Under ProfileManager, I can add certificate.. But don't know how (where to download/find) and which one I have to use? img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8r2Bb.png" alt="Add Certificate" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/77QbE.png" alt="Options"  hr  More additional information  strongMac version/strong: OS X El Capitan (10.11.4)  strongOS X Server/strong: Server 5.1  strongHostname/strong: mdmserver.domainname.be  strongComputername/strong: macserver  strongInternet/strong: Available on mdmserver.domainname.be  I opened port strong80,443,2195,2196,1640/strong on the firewall (https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202487)  <answer238061> The problem is solved. The problem was caused by the strongcertificates/strong. I really needed strongsigned certificates/strong for "mdmserver.domainname.be" (Server  Certificates).  But keep in mind, it has to be with a strongCSR/strong created by the strongos server/strong, it's not enough to create a CSR with a CSR generator (like directadmin, ..). Thats because you can't add your own private key/csr, the server has its own.
