How to use Mouse's Right Click Manually on keyboard? <body> I'm using MacBook Pro. My Apple mouse that I only got last year when I right click on the mouse, nothing happens. I'm supposed to get a delete message so I can "move to trash" or "remove reference" my files. Since my right click on mouse isn't working. How do I get the delete followed by "move to trash" or "remove reference" to appear by clicking what on keyboard?  <answer201934> Use kbdoption/kbd click.   You can set your mouse to use right click in the strongSystem Preferences/strong. Go to the ï£¿ logo at the top left of your screen to get there. Or click the icon on your dock.
