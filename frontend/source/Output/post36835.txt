Waking up MBP for external display <body> According to the docs, to use an external monitor as the sole/primary display device, I can close the lid on my MBP. To wake it up I can either press a key on my bluetooth or mouse.   Therein lies my problem. I am using an external USB apple keyboard and a logitech M705 mouse. Both of these devices don't seem to be able to wake up my MBP.   Any idea?  <comment41889> why not just use both? why turn down the free screen real-estate? <comment41890> Using the macbook closed can cause heat build up if ur running ur macbook at high load constantly <comment41892> Personal preference I suppose. Also, using 3rd party aero snap software doesnt snap my folder/programes to the edge of my right screen on my external. <comment41893> Have you tried cinch? It does the same thing and it works only both my displays just fine <comment41894> lol lack of aerosnap justifies not using a whole second monitor at all? :O <comment41895> btw u can use cinch for free as a trial (it's $1 on sale on the mac app store) if u download it from the website and just suffer through a a 3 second delay every time the program starts, it's no big deal
