Continue managing external drive backups on a different computer <body> I have an external drive with data on it that is shared on the local network. There's another external drive that's daisy chained where backups are stored.   The computer that was originally managing the backups with Time Machine has been replaced and the drives have been moved to another computer.  hr  h2The Problem/h2  When I select the backup drive for time machine, it attempts to duplicate all the files again since it doesn't recognize the previous backups since they were made on a different computer.  I have tried using codetmutil inheritbackup/code and codetmutil associatedisk/code but have been hit with a couple errors.  precode$ sudo tmutil inheritbackup /Volumes/BACKUP_HD/OLD_CPU Unexpectedly found no machine directories for "/Volumes/BACKUP_HD/OLD_CPU" during collision check. $ sudo tmutil associatedisk -a /Volumes/DATA_HD /Volumes/BACKUP_HD/OLD_CPU/Latest/DATA_HD Not a snapshot volume. /code/pre  Attempting to manage the backups on the new computer ends up trying to duplicate the data again, which is less than ideal.  <answer93062> A simple solution I found is to switch the new computer's name to the old one through codeSystem Preferences &gt; Sharing/code .  Not quite the solution I'm looking for, but it works.  <comment108559> I assume you are trying to avoid starting over with  a wiped disk, but it may prove simpler ... <comment108565> Yes. If possible, I'd like the new computer to pick up where the last one left off without needing to transfer it to another drive. <comment111014> You know what, that may be a perfectly good solution. That's the only official place to change the computer (host) name ...
