Macbook Aluminum wakes up - Lion Updated <body> I have recently updated my macbook with Lion. Now it keeps on waking up in my bag for some unknown reason. Here is what i get in the console.  codeAn Unknown USB Device (Port 4 of Hub at 0x4000000), may have caused a wake by being connected/code  I'm not sure what is at the port 4 of Hub? Also what i have discovered is that my bluetooth module apparently is not connected!? strongWhat would cause this to happen?/strong  This is from system info:  precodeUSB Bus:    Host Controller Location: Built-in USB   Host Controller Driver:   AppleUSBOHCI   PCI Device ID:    0x0aa5    PCI Revision ID:  0x00b1    PCI Vendor ID:    0x10de    Bus Number:   0x04   Apple Internal Keyboard / Trackpad:    Product ID:   0x0236   Vendor ID:    0x05ac  (Apple Inc.)

Could it be bluetooth module?   <comment23230> If you look in System Information, you might be able to see what that device is. <comment23239> @jtbandes updated question. <comment23244> Have you tried restarting your computer? <comment23247> @jtbandes I have restarted it many times, i even reinstalled OSX from scratch now. So its fully stock. <comment23271> I have ordered a replacement for monitor data cable - as i have also discovered that iSight is not working - since those both work on same cable I'll replace that and see how I go.
