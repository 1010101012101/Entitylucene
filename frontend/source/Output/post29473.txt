How can I remap the "`" key to "Esc" <body> I am using a Mac after five years of Linux. I had remapped "Caps Lock" to "Ctrl" and swapped the "`" with Escape.  I was able to figure out how to convert Caps Lock to a Control, but can't figure out how to do the second. Please suggest a good tool so I don't have to undo many years of muscle memory.  (I use OSX Lion)  <answer29476> The only way I know of doing this is by using a third party app; BetterTouchTool. Set it up to look like this : img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yr1D1.png" alt="enter image description here"  Create an applescript with codetell application "System Events" to key code 53/code and save it. Then add a new shortcut to BTT which runs the script.  <answer29479> The inconveniently named KeyRemap4Macbook should do that, without the need for an external applescript.  <answer29483> h2KeyRemap4MacBook/h2  A preference pane with currently about 1500 remapping options. Includes codeBackquote(`) to Escape/code and codeEscape to Backquote(`)/code.  hr  h2Ukelele/h2  You could create a custom code.keylayout/code like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JCODw.png" alt=""  Esc on the layout above worked with all of the things I tested:  ul liOS X UI actions like canceling a dialog and exiting full screen/li liOn some websites with keyboard navigation like Google Search/li liAs a meta key in Terminal.app/li /ul  Modifying special keys from a code.keylayout/code usually results in some unexpected issues though.  <comment33860> KeyRemap4MacBook works great! Thanks a ton. <comment33861> Hey! This seems like overkill for this, but thanks for letting me know of such a neat tool. I can see a lot of other things I can do with this.
