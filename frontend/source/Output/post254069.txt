Why are "People" different between macOS and iOS Photos? <body> I had assumed that macOS and iOS photos would be synchronized through iCloud (assuming all iCloud features are enabled) but the people I see in "People" on iOS are not the same as the ones I see on macOS.  As of today, iOS has spent days finding people and has nearly completed the process, but when I look in Photos on macOS, I see two contradictory things, neither of which is very comforting:  ul liPhotos on macOS says it is just starting to scan for people, even though the process on iOS is nearly complete, and/li liPhotos on macOS shows a different but larger set of people (with different photos, completely different numbers, and names, connected to contacts, which iOS lacks)./li /ul  This is unexpected, since Photos is synced through iCloud.  What's going on here:  ul liWhy do Photos need to be scanned again for faces on macOS, even though they've already been scanned on iOS?/li liWhy are there already Faces in macOS; and why are they different?/li liWhy isn't iOS aware of the name sand contact entries associated with the people they do share (at least by actual person)?/li /ul  Why are "People" different between macOS and iOS Photos (and how does that make any sense)?  <comment316263> I already had to redo these faces more than 5 times including after certain beta updates and after upgrading to the iPhone 7 and today it's again gone after resetting my iPhone 7 due to another issue and doing a full iCloud restore; so to get to the bottom of it for some reason Apple has decided to keep the faces database on the phone itself and not sync it with iCloud. <comment316264> @PinchusG.: Are you saying that People on macOS and People on iOS are different things?! <comment316266> unfortunately that's exactly what I've learned the past few weeks <comment316268> @PinchusG.: That can't possibly be the intent, can it. No wonder Apple is dead last in cloud services! <comment316276> @tubedogg: Yep, it's a dupe. Thanks! <comment327023> @PinchusG.: This nonsensical non-feature has been repaired in 10.1.1.
