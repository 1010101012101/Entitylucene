Invisible folder after usage of trash-cli <body> Recently, I decided to install trash-cli on my MacBook Pro after using it successfully on my Ubuntu machine. To set it up I ran the following commands.  precodegit clone https://github.com/andreafrancia/trash-cli.git sudo python setup.py install /code/pre  After installation, I decided to delete a folder using codetrash-put/code. So I run codetrash-put ~/anaconda//code. However, this folder has never arrived in my code.Trash/code folder, yet it disappeared from my Finder (see below, sorry for the mess of files).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/m57tS.png" alt="Screenshot of Finder in Terminal run with &lt;code&gt;ls -a&lt;/code&gt;"  So far so good, the folder disappeared. However, when running codelocate anaconda/code in a Terminal window the folder Anaconda is still there (only the first couple of lines are shown in the screenshot below).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7ct7g.png" alt="Screenshot of Finder in Terminal run with &lt;code&gt;locate anaconda&lt;/code&gt;"  Now, my question is whether any of you guys could have an idea on how I can delete this folder or at least make it re-appear in my Finder?  So far, I've tried restarting my MacBook without success. I've also tried to run coderm /Users/admin/anaconda/code which failed, too.   Running 10.10.1 on a MacBook Pro Mid-2012. I do have administrator rights and full access to all files.  hr  strongUPDATE 1/strong  ol licoderm/code output  rm: anaconda: No such file or directory/li licodefelix/code and codeadmin/code are the same user. I have renamed it for my own convenience purposes, but they are strongthe same/strong!/li /ol  <answer159647> As you have seen by running codels/code and coderm/code (and viewing in Finder), the code/Users/admin/anaconda/code folder and its contents are no longer present in the filesystem.  codelocate/code uses a database that is updated approximately once a week in OS X, so deleting a file/folder and immediately (or even later that day or week) using codelocate/code will not reflect its removal.  You can manually update the codelocate/code database by running this command:  precodesudo /usr/libexec/locate.updatedb /code/pre  See the locate.updatedb(8) man page for further information.  <comment187484> Why did you think that a CLI tool for the XORG environment would work on a Mac?? What exactly was the result when you tried the `rm` command for the folder? I also note that your `ls -a` and `locate` commands show you (Felix) as the user but the search result shows the `anaconda` directory located in the user `admin`'s directory.?? <comment187494> @douggro I've had it installed on my Mac before. I think under Mountain Lion. <comment187610> MacPorts includes the `rmtrash` command line utility, which uses the native OS X trash.
