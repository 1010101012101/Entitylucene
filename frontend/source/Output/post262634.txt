iCloud sync slowly taking up space <body> Over the course of like 15 minutes, iCloud starts filling up the hard drive, and when I restart, the space is freed again, and the process begins again. What should I do to prevent this?  <comment329035> How is iCloud filling the hard drive? Where do you see it being filled and how do you know it is iCloud? <comment329333> When I turn off the Wifi on my computer, it stops, and I have iCloud drive.  But when I go online, it continues. I also tried `while true; do killall cloudd; killall birdd; done` in Terminal, and it slows it down. @JaimeSantaCruz
