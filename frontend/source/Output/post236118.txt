How to make [return] behave as a [return] within Messages, Skype… <body> I am using codeMessages/code on both Macs &amp; iPhones and I am typing a lot of E-mails. Within all these environment I am used to the normal behaviour of the kbdreturn/kbd key.  Within codeMessages/code this key doesn't behave as a return key thus causing me to prematurely send truncated messages.  I found this very similar question: How to insert new line on return key press in iMessage on Mac OSX and I already knew the workarounds proposed kbdctrl/kbd+kbdreturn/kbd, kbdalt/kbd+kbdreturn/kbd. But these workarounds didn't answer the original question. Moreover I already use them but this still leave me with an strongunacceptable error rate/strong.  From my point of vue, the kbdreturn/kbd should never be associated with a "function" within an environment where you are at typing text. This is a stronghuge ergonomic design error/strong.  I tried to override the actual shortcut mapping with:  precodedefaults write com.apple.iChat NSUserKeyEquivalents '{ "                             " = "insertNewline:" ; } /code/pre  Which is a silent failure.  I suspect that the syntax of the function might be wrong, but codeMessages/code doesn't write any error about this.  Is there a documentation about the exact syntax of internal codeMessages/code functions which can be called from a shortcut?  Is there any other correct way to make the kbdreturn/kbd behave as a plain kbdreturn/kbd?  <answer236187> In Messages the keyboard combination to insert "new line" is:  ul likbdCTRL/kbd + kbd↩︎ Return/kbd/li /ul  It will not send the message, but will insert return carriage sign (a new line).  I'm using this all the time, when writing SMS/iMessages from MacBook... but yes, not really comfortable, as way too much of accidents when you are sending the truncated messages.  In most of Applications alike Skype and other Messengers insert of new line works on next keyboard shortcuts:  ul likbdCTRL/kbd + kbd↩︎ Return/kbd/li likbd⌥ Option/kbd + kbd↩︎ Return/kbd/li /ul  I do not recommend to override these shortcuts, as it's common-knowledge and standard behavior when working with Messages and Messengers.  In text processors, code editors and email editors have different behavior, as you see the big text area, and kbd↩︎ Return/kbd acts as a "new line" action. Modifiers alike kbdCTRL/kbd, kbd⌥ Option/kbd, kbd⌘ Command/kbd might work as additional functionality to insert "soft" new line, to insert new page, line break delimiter, etc.  hr  You might want to use strongBetterTouchTool/strong, which is was a free utility which can disable keyboard shortcuts (and has many other uses). The list of your actions to disable/enable the shortcut could be next:  ol liInstall emBetterTouchTool/em/li liClick on the codeBetterTouchTool/code menubar item and choose codePreferences/code/li liClick on codeKeyboard/code/li liClick the plus sign at the bottom of the codeSelect Application:/code pane/li liChoose codeMessages/code (in code/Applications/code folder)/li liClick code+ Add New Shortcut/code/li liClick codeKeyboard Shortcut/code, hit kbdreturn/kbd/li liClick codeTrigger Other Keyboard Shortcut/code, hit kbdctrl/kbd+kbdreturn/kbd/li liLeave codeTrigger Predefined Action:/code to codeNo Action/code (which is the default)/li lirepeat steps 7,8 &amp; 9 to remap kbdcmd/kbd+kbdreturn/kbd to kbdshift/kbd+kbdreturn/kbd/li /ol  Which should lead to such a screen: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Oryr6.png" alt="Better Touch return remapping"  <answer236255> Create a file (on a standard install, the directory codeKeyBindings/code doesn't exist):  precodemkdir ~/Library/KeyBindings /code/pre  containing the following 2 remappings:  precode$ cat &gt;~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict &lt;&lt;end_of_file /* my keybindings */ {         "\U000d" = ("insertLineBreak:") ;         "@\U000d" = ("insertNewline:") ; } end_of_file /code/pre  code@/code means kbdcmd/kbd in this dictionary, code\U000d/code means Unicode of the standard return (== code0x0d/code).  Restart codeMessages/code and from now on,  ul likbdreturn/kbd will put a strongreal/strong kbdreturn/kbd,/li likbdcmd/kbd+kbdreturn/kbd will strongsend the message/strong./li /ul  hr  h2Drawback/h2  This solution is applied to any application using code~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict/code.  h2Advantage/h2  This solution is applied to any application which does a non emnatural/em use of the return in a text area. Most notably I now have a codeSkype/code with which I don't send any more prematurely truncated messages.  <answer247214> h2Install Karabiner/h2  Which can be found there: Karabiner: a keyboard customizer for OS X  h2Make a codeprivate.xml/code/h2  Read the codeKarabiner/code documentation on the topic: private.xml Reference Manual  Create the code${HOME}/Library/Application Support/Karabiner/private.xml/code with the following content:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;   &lt;appdef&gt;     &lt;appname&gt;MESSAGES&lt;/appname&gt;     &lt;equal&gt;com.apple.iChat&lt;/equal&gt;     &lt;equal&gt;com.skype.skype&lt;/equal&gt;   &lt;/appdef&gt;   &lt;item&gt;     &lt;name&gt;Messages return modification&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;appendix&gt;Change Return to Newline&lt;/appendix&gt;     &lt;appendix&gt;Change Newline to Return&lt;/appendix&gt;     &lt;identifier&gt;swap Return and Newline&lt;/identifier&gt;     &lt;only&gt;MESSAGES&lt;/only&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::RETURN, ModifierFlag::COMMAND_L, KeyCode::RETURN&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::RETURN, KeyCode::RETURN, ModifierFlag::CONTROL_L&lt;/autogen&gt;   &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  Depending upon your taste, use codevi/code, codeemacs/code or codeTextEdit/code (but of course not codeWord/code).  h2Load your codeprivate.xml/code/h2  Tell codeKarabiner/code you will use a custom setting: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/klCH7.png" alt="Use prepared settings"  and load it: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4KgNQ.png" alt="Apply prepared settings"  h2Test it/h2  Start codeMessages/code or codeSkype/code and check that you can type kbdreturn/kbd within any message and send a message with kbdcommand ⌘/kbdkbdreturn/kbd.  <comment288875> Any tweak may be dependant on you having both Return & Enter keys on your keyboard [not that I have an answer, just that laptops tend to only have one general purpose Ret/Enter, whereas desktops have both] <comment289205> I have many keyboards on which I am working, some of them do have an `enter` key others don't (Mac Book Pro). Anyway, the key I have problem with is the key which is basically designed to enter a return many times per minute and is purposefully one of the larger of any keyboard. •••• I want my return :) ! <comment290085> Hm, but is it a problem really, especially with Skype? it uses the standard keyboard behavior, alike other messengers do, so it's quick to get used to default behavior. I'm almost not using a mouse/touchpad, only keyboard combinations, and the chance of sending truncated messages almost absent. <comment290229> It was regularly a problem because I am fast at typing and the return is a regular one I use. •••• This nightmare is now finished :). <comment327855> Thank you so much for this, just what I was looking for.
