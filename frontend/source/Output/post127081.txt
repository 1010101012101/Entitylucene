How can I recover photos from Photo Stream to my computer? <body> My iPhone's screen decided to die on me, so the screen is black, and I got a Samsung to replace it. The problem is that I can't get anything off of my phone. I did back up to my iCloud but how I am going to get all of my photos that I saved on iCloud?  <answer127095> As this is tagged photo-stream I presume that you 'backed up' to Photo Stream. You can recover the photos from your Photo Stream by opening the Photo Stream on your computer.  precode~/Library/Application Support/iLifeAssetManagement/assets/sub /code/pre  Inside this folder are all the photos from your Photo Stream. Copy them to your new phone.  <comment148877> Welcome to AskDifferent, could you please add more relevant information about your issue?
