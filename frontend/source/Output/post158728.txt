Can spotlight do Int > Hex conversion ? <body> Spotlight is great to do some fast calculation and conversions.   But can he also do some geeky conversions like strongIntegers/strong &lt; strongHexadecimals/strong or strongIntegers/strong &lt; strongBinary/strong ?   <answer252742> I use Alfred for the Mac -- one of the most used tools I have. https://www.alfredapp.com  You will need the PowerPack for workflows. As a user I would recommend the lifetime update option. It keeps getting better and better.  There is an Alfred workflow created: https://github.com/obstschale/NSC/ that easily does number format conversion.  <comment186586> Don't think so, but calculator can, Cmd 1/Cmd 3 to swap between <comment347509> @Tetsujin Man, I wish I could up vote your comment 100 times!
