No Wifi Connection on Macbook Air <body> I have an issue with my MacBook Air.  It won't connect to my home internet but strangely enough it will connect to my iPhone and my sistes Mac Air but not mine.  Is there any solution?  <comment114962> Let's see if anyone has a ready answer. If not, we can help you edit your question to provide more details on what you've tried, what exactly you don't get. See the guides on [about] and [ask] if you don't get an answer and decide to edit your question. They are often helpful in refining / reframing your query. <comment114963> Specifically: Did you try to use the network assistant? Can your sister's MBA connect to your home network? Can your iPhone? How is the network set up (WiFi, Ethernet) and connected to your telco/provider? <comment114971> Sometimes opening the Guest Network, with no password, works in that subsequently, the machine can connect normally.
