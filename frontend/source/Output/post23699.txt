Is it possible to send mail using Command + Enter in Mail? <body> I can't think of any reason why kbdCommand ⌘/kbd + kbdEnter ↩/kbd would not send a mail draft, instead of the current shortcut, which is kbdCommand ⌘/kbd + kbdShift ⇧/kbd + kbdD/kbd Is there a way to change this?  <answer23704> You can look at this answer and apply accordingly to your case.  TL;DR version:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pkj3E.png" alt="system preferences keyboard shortcut"  <answer52574> I tried to use the System Preferences, Keyboard Shortcuts tab to define Command+Return to send a mail.  But the effect was that Command+emShift/em+Return sends mail.  <answer147786> I found a solution in Mathias's dotfiles. In a Terminal window, type:  precodedefaults write com.apple.mail NSUserKeyEquivalents -dict-add "Send" "@\U21a9" /code/pre  Then restart Mail.app  <comment173415> Did you solve this? I have the same problem. <comment173691> Daniel Serodio, I am using MailMate now, which kind of solves it, but it's not what you had in mind...
