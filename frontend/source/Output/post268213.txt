What are the tools required to develop iOS applications? <body> What are the tools (hardware/software) required to develop iOS applications? Because I want to learn iPhone application development.  <answer268216> You'll need a Mac (any current model will do) and Xcode which can be downloaded from the Mac App Store. It comes with all the tools necessary, including a Simulator. It nevertheless is recommended to test apps on the hardware (aka an iPhone) as well.  Additional details can be found here.  <comment336621> He also needs Mac hardware... <comment336625> Could probably link to this: https://developer.apple.com/xcode/ide/ ? <comment336637> [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) is your best starting point. <comment336873> Thanks for help. :-) IconDaemon <comment336965> You're welcome, Jyoti.
