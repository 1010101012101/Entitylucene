cal command - start monday <body> I was wondering - is there a way to make 'cal' (a terminal program) start the week on monday?   Usually it can be done with the -m flag, but this does not have any effect on the Mac. AFAIK, for freebsd you need deskutils, but I could not find any equivalent on the mac, even in homebrew.  Is there a switch or alternate source for a cal tool that allows weekday start changes?  <answer93909> GNU cal has a code--starting-day/code option:  precode$ brew install gcal $ alias cal='gcal --starting-day=1' $ cal        June 2013  Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa Su                  1  2   3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10 11 12 13 14 15 16  17 18 19 20 21 22 23  24 25 26 27 28 29 30 /code/pre  codencal/code also starts weeks on mondays by default:  precode$ ncal     June 2013 Mo     3 10 17 24 Tu     4 11 18 25 We     5 12 19 26 Th     6 13 20 27 Fr     7 14 21 28 Sa  1  8 15 22 29 Su  2  9 16 23 30 /code/pre  <answer93980> This Macworld.com OS X Hint shows some scripting to put Monday firstâ€¦  precodecal | awk '{ print " "$0; getline; print " Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa Su"; \ getline; if (substr($0,1,2) == " 1") print "                    1 "; \ do { prevline=$0; if (getline == 0) exit; print " " \ substr(prevline,4,17) " " substr($0,1,2) " "; } while (1) }' /code/pre  Result:  precode      June 2013  Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa Su                  1  2    3  4  5  6  7  8  9   10 11 12 13 14 15 16   17 18 19 20 21 22 23   24 25 26 27 28 29 30  /code/pre  <answer126305> code$ man cal/code says: em"The cal utility displays a simple calendar in traditional format and ncal offers an alternative layout, more options and the date of easter. The new format is a little cramped but it makes a year fit on a 25x80 terminal. If arguments are not specified, the current month is displayed"/em. To me, it seems preferable to use codencal/code as opposed to implementing an ugly hack.  <comment110120> Yeah, I was aware of that - which makes it even stranger. However, ideally I would prefer using 'cal' instead. Thanks for your answer though, it is appreciated. <comment226502> The **cal** of OSX has something different with GNU/Linux. I will use the **gcal**, thank you very much!
