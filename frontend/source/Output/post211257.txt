How to set up Keyboard Maestro correctly so that it doesn't catch its own Macro? <body> I used to insert kbd;/kbd character by pressing button below kbdESC/kbd on Windows, (which does kbd&lt;/kbd on MacBook) and kbd$/kbd by holding kbdalt/kbd + the button next to kbdL/kbd key on Windows.  I've downloaded Keyboard Maestro and it worked pretty well on Yosemite, but on El Capitan, it somehow, probably, does catch its own keystrokes, randomly. I've got two Macros:   ul likbd⌥;/kbd - should write $/li likbd&lt;/kbd (below esc) - should write ;/li /ul  The problem is, that when I press kbd&lt;/kbd, it does catch my Macro, wants to insert correct keystroke (kbd;/kbd) but somehow inserts kbd$/kbd for unknown reason (maybe because when they simulate original shortcut for kbd;/kbd, which is kbd⌥;/kbd, second Macro catches it?). It does happen very randomly. Quick try:  precode;$;$$$$$$$$$$$$;$$$$$;$$$$$$$;$$;$;$ /code/pre  How should I workaround this without having to add any more keys or something like that?
