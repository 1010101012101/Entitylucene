Podcast App with "nice" cloud features <body> I'm looking for a podcast playing app with the following properties:  ol liI can import a bunch of old episodes easily /li liIt is possible to keep emall/em of the episodes, either on Dropbox or on an external hard drive, and sync a selection of the episodes onto my iPhone (for different trips, I'll bring different sets of episodes along)./li /ol  Does such a thing exist? So far all of the apps I've looked at appear to sync all episodes.
