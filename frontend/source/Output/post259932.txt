Facebook notifications are shown multiple times <body> Whenever I get a new Facebook notification, the same message is displayed 20 times in the notification center. I noticed this is only the case for Facebook, and I've been experiencing this since I upgraded to Sierra.  Any ideas on how to solve this, or what might be the cause of this issue?  strongEdit:/strong There is a thread on Apple's discussion forum about this issue. However, not solved yet.  <answer260411> One useful method would be to turn off notifications in the settings then turn it back on. If that doesn't work, try rebooting your system too.  strongTo Reboot The iPhone:/strong Hold the power button for a few seconds, then slide at the top to power off. Wait a few seconds then hold the power button for a few seconds to power on the iPhone.  strongTo Reboot The iMac:/strong Click "Restart" in the Apple menu. If that isn't possible, press the iMac power button to power off then press it again to power on.  strongTo Reboot On Windows:/strong Click the Windows icon, then click the short arrow, which will give more options. Click "Restart" to restart the Windows system.  <answer273704> There's a different thread on the official Apple forums that claims to have a solution:  ol lidisable all facebook related notification settings in system settings - notifications./li liremove your facebook account from system settings - internet accounts./li liremove all facebook related objects from your keychain and restart your mac./li lilog on to facebook, you will be asked if you want to use this account for mac system integration, click on later./li liin facebook go to settings - security - where you're logged in - delete all old session, especially the ones under "Apple OS Integration"./li liclear safari cache and restart your mac./li lilog on to facebook, you will be asked if you want to use this account for mac system integration, this time click ok and check the notifications setting, if everything ok, restart your mac once again./li /ol  <comment326094> This is meant for just the Mac... Not for Windows or iPhone! <comment328259> I did not know that.
