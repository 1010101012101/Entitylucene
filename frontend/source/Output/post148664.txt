MacBook Pro won't recognise Sandisk 64GB Mini SD card <body> I bought a 64GB Sandisk for my GoPro Hero 3+ and it works fine.  However, when I either plug in my GoPro directly via a USB cable or try to access the drive by using an SD-card adapter, all that comes up is     The disk you inserted was not readable by this computer.   The options presented are codeInitialise/code, codeIgnore/code and codeEject/code. When I select codeInitialise/code it comes up with a program I have never used or seen before.  I am not very good with computers so any help is great! I have recently had my laptop updated but I am not sure which update it has.  (My laptop reads other cards and this card works on a Windows computer.)  <answer148677> The HERO3+ camera uses the exFAT file system format and it should be readable on your Mac if it uses Mac OS X from Snow Leopard on up. The link above notes that if you are having difficulty using a 64GB card, that you can use a 32GB or smaller card and format it with the old FAT32 standard.  <comment175174> Thanks for your help, i have had a look at the link above and my Mac has Mavericks so i don't think it is compatible. Any suggestions in how i can make it work? <comment175212> Problem sovled, very happy. <comment175259> Please mark my answer as the solution, please, if the problem has been solved.
