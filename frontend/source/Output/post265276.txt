iPhone note disappeared after restore from iTunes backup <body> I lost my iPhone 6s and got new iPhone 6s. I restored my iPhone from iTunes backup. All data appeared but a note which is very important to me disappeared. I saw all notes for few seconds and then they disappeared.   How can I recover my notes from the backup or bring back the disappeared note?   <comment332712> Maybe check on iCloud.com?
