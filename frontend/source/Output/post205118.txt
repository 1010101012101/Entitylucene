Once you've glanced at the video size,  there's nothing stopping you from cancelling the upload right away so you dont spend unnecessary data.  An option that needs no upload is the View Exif app extension - it will process the video file on your phone/iPad and tell you the size of the video and no need to leverage another service.  <answer283900> Connect your iphone 6 to computer and iphone 6 folder appear in computer this pc. Now click on video whose size you want to find. or hover mouse over that video file and it shows the size of video file.  Secondly try to share it on utube and it will show size of video before uploading to utube.  <comment247431> iOS often [compress videos](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/39105/does-the-iphone-compress-emailed-videos) somewhat before showing the compose email window, I believe.
