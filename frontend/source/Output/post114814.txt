How to reinstall/repair OS X without losing files? <body> I bought a Macbook Pro in 2012, it came with OS X Lion. (came with NO disc, etc)br 1 Month ago I downloaded the update "Mountain Lion". About 2 weeks ago I removed some of the OS X Mountain Lion System files (Twitter, Facebook, etc)  After I deleted some of the system files, if I quit Notes, Contacts and other apps they freeze. I have also noticed other issues with the Mac. I have restarted, cleaned, repaired permissions, made a new account, etc but no good.  Am I able to somehow reset/repair everything, like doing a reinstall of Mountain Lion, without losing my files, apps, etc? I have no problem with the settings being set to default (I would like that).  For example, with Windows you can do a reinstall but all the files and apps are kept in a Windows.old file, and with Windows 8 you can do a config/system settings reset but all your files will be kept.  Time Machine has been disabled since I got this Mac.  <answer114816> You can do an strongArchive &amp; Install/strong which will reinstall OS X but keep your files.br emDon't forget to make a backup before you reinstall in case something goes wrong./em  ol liBoot with âŒ˜R to enter the Recovery HD./li liChoose Reinstall OS X./li liFollow the instructions./li /ol
