OS X Numbers. Column labels to numbers <body> HibrI am using Numbers on OS X br It show me column names with letters img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kV66X.png" alt="enter image description here"  But I want to show it with numbers, like Rows. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/e3BZf.png" alt="enter image description here"  Thank You.  <answer206745> Generally, what is done is to create a strongColumn Header/strong.  You already have a perfect example of this in the table shown in your question. Row 1 contains field names for each data record.  i.e.: "Image", "whale_00", etc. (See "Work with Rows and Columns" in Numbers Help)  ul liSelect strongRow 1/strong and convert to strongHeader Row/strong/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GtSNd.png" alt="Converting row to header"  If you wish, you can create a header row with you own number system. This would be much faster and less tedious than renaming the column designations.  (In answer to your question: Cannot presently be done in Numbers.) NOTE: By design, Numbers will use your emHeader Row Data/em in calculations so you can easily identify the data being referenced.  ul liAdd a strongRow Above/strong your first row./li liEnter ordinal numbers in the first and second cells.  For example: codeA1 = 1, B1 = 2/code/li liSelect both cells in the row and drag the "yellow dot" across the width of the row to number each column./li liConvert this to a strongHeader Row/strong/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CvRU7.gif" alt="Auto numbering row ordinaly"  <comment248779> Welcome to Ask Different.  I have to ask, Why?  Even if it were possible (I don't think even Excel has this feature) it would cause confusion in cell references. "A1" would become "11".  What is the specific reason you need numbers as column id's? <comment249199> Because I have very big csv file. And I want to see, for example what in 1234th column, <comment249222> to downvoter, anything I could improve?  I don't mind a deserved down-vote, but an explanation would be nice. <comment250195> Dont mind bro, Your answer is really helped me. Thank you again <comment250196> Glad it helped! Cheers!
