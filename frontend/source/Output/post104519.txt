OS X software RAID 0 with 6x SATA SSD? <body> I will be able to use a former video editing "Mac Pro" code:)/code for a bit, free to configure anything I want in software.  I would like to experiment with setting up OS X software RAID 0 with 6x SATA SSD.  No data reliability required, I will have to relinquish the box after a few tests.  Is this the very best I can get from the storage layer of this machine? Does it make sense to RAID 0 6x SSD drives? Will I be able to install OS X on the software-striped logical volume?  If you have theoretical arguments in favour or against, please explain your rationale. If you have practical experience with OS X software RAID with no parity, that would be ideal!  <answer104924> I suspect that 6 SSDs can provide more bandwidth than the SouthBridge Controller on the MacPro can support (maybe 8Gbit/s or 1GB/s)? This may also depend on the model of MacPro that you're using.  The throughput supported by the drives themselves may also come into play...Some SSDs achieve reads of about 250MB/s, while others support rates around 480-500MB/s. Your 3Gb/s SATA ports will probably top out at 375MB/s  My money's on a benchmark of about 1GB/sec for your 6xSSD RAID-0 volume's read rates...Probably a little less for writes...You can probably attain the same speed by striping 3 or 4 drives together.  You can definitely install OS X on this striped volume, but you may not be able to put the recovery partition onto that drive.  Regardless, the AJA Kona System Test is a good utility to use for this benchmarking. I'd be interested to hear what you find.  <comment123743> I have since been discouraged to RAID-0 those drives.. I never run a proper benchmark on them though. I should have, as you said. I can confirm installation on the striped drive works.
