An error occurred while moving messages to mailbox “(null)” <body> I just moved my IMAP email from one server to another and now while I'm trying to delete any emails, Mail produces the following error:     An error occurred while moving messages to mailbox “(null)”.   I Google'd for it and found a lot of folks out there who are having the exact same issue but was not able to find solution.  <answer156377> This helped in my case (same error message, IMAP-server, deleting messages always popped up this error):  Mail → Preferences → emtroubled account/em → Mailbox Behavior and removed the tick on "store deleted messages on server".  Here is where I found help: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/1986823?tstart=0  <answer165179> Try selecting the Trash mailbox (folder) and then the menu item:  strongMailbox/strong → strongUse This Mailbox As/strong → strongTrash Mailbox/strong  <answer166937> If this is occurring with a Gmail IMAP account:  This problem occurred for me because my codeTrash/code label in gmail was not set to 'show in IMAP' (despite following the recommendation of @rcarver).  I required one additional step first, i.e.  ol liIn Gmail settings, make sure that the trash label is set to 'show' and 'Show in IMAP'./li liIn Mail.app, select the trash folder, Mailbox → Use This Mailbox As → Trash Mailbox.br [see @rcarver's answer above]/li /ol  <answer182532> Unsure if you've resolved the issue but I've just had the same problem and fixed it.  Select the trash folder in your new email account. Click 'Mailbox' from the toolbar and 'Use this mailbox as', then click on trash.  Solved it straight away :)   <comment187093> very risky! accidentally deleted message is `GONE` for good! no thank you! <comment196079> Why the downvote?? <comment206337> This worked for me, so I don't know. <comment217361> your answer brings nothing to the table, as this question been already answered & accepted and you just repeating what the other guy already said. <comment251544> I've no idea, but it feel like that this should be the right answer. <comment251628> Had same issue with El Capitan and this fixed it. Thanks. <comment261270> This makes it so deleted messages are gone permanently - not a viable solution to the original post question - I guess. <comment262279> I was having this issue with an IMAP account on a custom domain on El Capitan and this fixed it as well. Thanks! <comment280085> This worked for me. The Mailbox → Use This Mailbox As → Trash Mailbox option was greyed out.
