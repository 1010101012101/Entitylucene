Show thumbnails of AVI and WMV files in finder <body> In OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion, I could view thumbnails/previews of code.wmv/code and code.avi/code files in Finder through the software Flip4Mac. However in Mavericks, I cannot see previews although I've installed the newest Flip4Mac (3.2.0.16) software. Did something in OS X 10.9 Mavericks change for previewing in finder? Is it possible to get a preview of code.avi/code and code.wmv/code files?  <answer295172> Apparently I was a bit trigger-happy with the bounty, because after a bit more Googling, I stumbled upon strongQLVideo/strong, which:     "-- allows macOS Finder to display thumbnails, static QuickLook previews, cover art and metadata for most types of video files."   The Github page has an installer (.pkg) under the releases page, but if you have Homebrew installed, you can also use codebrew cask install qlvideo/code on command line (that's what I used â€” and thumbnails started generating immediately).   It even has couple of settings available:     ul   licodedefaults write uk.org.marginal.qlvideo SnapshotAlways -bool XX/code      ul   liControls whether QuickLook "Preview" shows static snapshot(s) even if   a playable preview is available. Default is NO./li   /ul/li   licodedefaults write uk.org.marginal.qlvideo SnapshotCount -int XX/code      ul   liMaximum number of   snapshots to show in a QuickLook "Preview". Default is 10./li   /ul/li   licodedefaults write uk.org.marginal.qlvideo SnapshotTime -int XX/code      ul   liTime offset in   seconds for thumbnails and for single snapshots. Unless the video clip   is shorter than twice this value, in which case the snapshot is taken   at the mid-point. Default is 60./li   liThis setting doesn't affect thumbnails that have already been generated - use codeqlmanage -r cache/code and re-start Finder to force regeneration of existing thumbnails./li   /ul/li   /ul   <comment142228> Could you edit your question with the actual Flip4Mac software version? Just to make sure you have the correct one. <comment142231> Did you also download the new player (v3.2.1)? (see for more info [the F4M support page](http://www.telestream.net/telestream-support/flip4mac-wmv/faq.htm?kbArticle=mavericks&kbURL=http://kb.telestream.net/Flip4mac/Flip4Mac/01Technical_Specifications/01System_Requirements/OS_X_10.9_Mavericks_Support)) <comment142232> I hate it when a software needs to be updated after installing the most recent version from the website. Nevertheless 3.2.1 has the same result. The problem is really only with previews and thumbnails and I'm guessing something changed so that plug-ins for displaying other content is not allowed in mavericks?! :( <comment373162> Accept the answer given or post a comment with what happened.
