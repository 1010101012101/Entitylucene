Create SavedSearch Criteria Using OR not AND <body> I'd like to create a savedSearch in Finder that looks for recent Documents AND pdf's. If I create a rule such as:  precodeKind is Document Kind is PDF /code/pre  it will look for things that are Documents AND pdfs. How do I set it to look for Documents OR pdfs?  <answer161931> Since PDF is also a Document those can not be separated with a "or".  If you want to search only for pure Documents (non PDF) , the use the serch box and select what kind of document you are after  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kgXHu.jpg" alt="document"  If you want to search for PDF (that are also Documents use that.  <answer161936> Yes, you can:  ol liSelect Finder. Create a Smart Folder using the key combination kbdOption/kbd+kbdCommand/kbd+kbdN/kbd/li liClick the code+/code icon. codeKind is any/code is the default search rule. Leave it for now. /li listrongMost important step:/strong Hold down the kbdOption/kbd key. You will see the code+/code icon change to code…/code/li liSimply click the code…/code icon to add strongemconditional criteria/em/strong. Use the default, code"Any : of the following are true”/code/li liSpecify the criteria using two rules: codeKind is Document/code and codeKind is PDF/code/li liNow, delete first search rule made in Step 2. Here is a screenshot of the result:/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kYrlW.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  As you can see, “any of the following..” functions as “or” (versus “all of the following..” which functions as “and”)   <comment189288> This is so great! You can even combine "Any" and "All"! <comment189481> @Adam_G Yes. And a TON more criteria to search by exist in the `…` dropdown than that which exist in the default dropdown. It’s a hidden feature that allows for one to search his filesystem in a much more powerful way! Cheers.
