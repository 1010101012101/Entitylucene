How to transfer video files from ipad air to macbook air <body> There is no file explorer type utility in iOS just like we have it on Android system. So how can I copy files from/to my iPad from/to other computers (MacBook/Windows)?  Specifically I am interested in the video created by the iOS Camera app.  <answer161365> Use AirDrop. With the video selected on the iPad, and the MB Finder in AirDrop, chose the Share button (box w/ curved arrow), then find and chose AirDrop.   strongEDIT:/strong See Import photos and videos from your iOS device to MAC or Windows  <answer161395> I use Dropbox's automatic Camera Upload feature. If you've installed Dropbox on your computers, they should start downloading the videos as soon as the iPad has uploaded them.  <comment188751> The Dropbox (and other cloud-based solutions) are good but they limit me to have a working internet connection. What if I don't have the internet connection at the moment, or is it too much slow to upload MBs of data.
