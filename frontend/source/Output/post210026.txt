Upgrading from Snow Leopard (10.6.3) to Mountain Lion <body> How do I upgrade to Mountain Lion, and then to El Capitan?  I just installed Snow Leopard (10.6.3). I have tried to upgrade to Mountain Lion, but that requires that I have 10.6.8 or higher, which I don't.

Do all the upgrading on a system where the data was migrated in. Once all is done you could image that system back to the Mac or re-run the installers on the primary system.
