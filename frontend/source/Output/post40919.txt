Better tabs management in Safari 6.x <body> I'm looking for extensions to allow the Safari 6.x versions to manage a large number of open tabs better than the current implementation. In particular I'm looking for two features:  ol liemVertical tabs/em. This is possible in Firefox by means of the extension Tree Style Tab./li liemApp tabs/em. In Firefox it is possible to pin tabs as emapp tabs/em./li /ol  Up to know I've found and tried several times SafariStand but it doesn't look great and it doesn't provide the features of emTree Style Tab/em. I would really like to move from Firefox to Safari, but for the problem of "I have too many useful extensions in Firefox." :)  Has anyone discovered extensions that add these features to Safari for OS X?  <answer113725> Safari does not allow extensions or plugins to mess with the tab bar. If you really need this functionality, your best bet is to use Firefox with the plugin you mentioned.  <comment46356> I don't know of any, but I would give my right arm for an extension that did this http://blogg.antrop.se/interaktionsdesign/redesigning-the-browser-window - well, someone's right arm, no point wasting a good one... <comment98205> Myself as well, I love that extension for Firefox, and I just found one for Chrome as well, but when I am one my mac I really would prefer to use Safari, I guess I am just weird that way. <comment98254> IMO the best Safari enhancer out there is glims (http://www.machangout.com/), but it doesn't appear to have the two features you require. :-( <comment108211> This article on Mac Stories describes how to get vertical tabs in Safari *4*. I haven't tested it, and don't know if it still works in 5, but maybe this would work for you: http://www.macstories.net/tutorials/how-to-get-vertical-tabs-on-safari-4-106/ <comment108212> 6, even. Safari version numbers seem to be incrementing faster than I realise. :P <comment109278> @AlexChan that link is for SafariStand which is in the question. However SafariStand is the only think I have seen that does any form of vertical tabs <comment110959> Since Safari 7 is announced to make major changes in how tabs are handled, let's make this specific to Safari 6. Should 7 not be as different as it looks, we can edit that out - but we should focus on a narrow version since there clearly isn't an add-on that works across all versions that are out (let alone what's coming). <comment133424> However you can get the equivalent extra functionality with SafariStand it adds a vertical set of tabs and leves Safari's in place. However doe not work with Safari 7 <comment133425> Patching Safari with SIMBL is not a long-term solution.
