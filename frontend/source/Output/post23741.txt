Customize the Boot Camp Drive Icon in Lion <body> A while ago, I remember having customized the Boot Camp drive icon with a pretty simple hack.  It was on Mac OS X Tiger.br And it was that hack.  Now I'm running Lion. Windows 7 is comfy on his Boot Camp partition, and i'm willing to get some candy finish for my Mac OS' desktop icons.  The problem is: I can't find any way to do it in Lion. Google has been of no help. The hack above isn't working anymore. (It wasn't working in leopard or snow leopard neither, as far as I remember)  Magical solution needed, anyone has a clue about it?  Does OS X Lion discard completely the use of non-writable drive icons?  <answer23767> delWill Candybar work for you? It allows you to change icons, but I'm not sure about drive icons. Lemme know if it works for you./del  Ok, according to this article, you can:  ul liPaste your icon (in the Get Info window) onto a USB thumb drive formatted as FAT32./li liThe name of the drive doesn't matter.  /li liLaunch Windows through Boot Camp, Parallels Desktop, or VMware Fusion.  /li liOpen the thumb drive in Windows.  /li liSelect Folder Optionsâ€¦ from the Tools menu, and set it to show invisible files.  /li liCopy the two files .VolumeIcon.icns and ._[cr]File, where [cr] is a carriage return, to the NTFS drive.  /li /ul  According to the article, that'll work.  <comment26570> Yes, Candybar does indeed allow to change drive icons. I own a copy of it for a while now. But as the Boot Camp volume is NTFS formatted, you can't write to it. So you can't change the icon from Mac OS X.
