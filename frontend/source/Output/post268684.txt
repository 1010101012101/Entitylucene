I can only get a capital P with caps lock on, mid-2014 Macbook Pro <body> So, when I hold the kbdShift/kbd key and hit kbdp/kbd,nothing happens. If I select kbdCaps Lock/kbd and then kbdp/kbd, I get a capital "P".    What gives?  I've looked in System Preferences and don't see that key combination as a shortcut.  Any ideas?    <answer268719> My first suggestion would be to reset both your SMC and NVRAM.   strong[Reset NVRAM]/strong  ol listrongShut down your machine./strong Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out./li listrongPress the kbdpower button/kbd emand then/em press the kbdcommand/kbdkbdoption/kbdkbdp/kbdkbdr/kbd keys./strong You have to make sure you press these keys before the gray screen appears or it wonâ€™t work./li listrongHold those keys down/strong until your Mac reboots again and you here the startup chime./li listrongLet go of the keys and let your Mac reboot normally./strong/li /ol  strongNote:/strong When you log back in you strongemmay/em/strong need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. speaker volume, screen resolution, startup disk selection, time zone information, etc).  strong[Reset SMC]/strong  To reset the SMC on a Mid-2014 MBP follow these steps:  ol liShut down your computer  ol start="2" liKeep the MagSafe adapter (power cable) strongplugged in/strong./li liPress at the same time kbdshift/kbdkbdoption/kbdkbdcontrol/kbd (on the left side of the keyboard) strongemand/em/strong the kbdpower button/kbd/li liLet go/li liTurn your computer back on with the power button./li /ol/li /ol  <comment337399> Is the problem only with "P" or does it happen anywhere else? <comment337402> Have you tried resetting the SMC? <comment337403> It's only the P.  It's the weirdest thing I've ever seen. <comment337404> What's the SMC?? <comment337406> Nevermind.  I just looked it up.  I'll try that.  Thanks!
