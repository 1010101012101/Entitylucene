Using AppleScript to find information about images in Pages documents <body> I'm trying to extract information about images placed into a Pages ('09 v 4.3) document. The following script is my attempt:  precodetell application "Pages"     tell front document         repeat with pg in pages             tell pg                 set im to images                 repeat with i in im                     tell i                         get image data                     end tell                 end repeat             end tell         end repeat     end tell end tell /code/pre  While it doesn't produce errors, and finds every image, it doesn't return any data either and I don't know why it doesn't:  precodeget every image of item 1 of every page of document 1         --&gt; {image 1 of foreground layer of page 1 of document id 14126328} get image data of image 1 of foreground layer of page 1 of document id 14126328 get every image of item 2 of every page of document 1         --&gt; {image 1 of foreground layer of page 2 of document id 14126328} get image data of image 1 of foreground layer of page 2 of document id 14126328 get every image of item 4 of every page of document 1     --&gt; {image 1 of foreground layer of page 4 of document id 14126328} get image data of image 1 of foreground layer of page 4 of document id 14126328 ... /code/pre  <answer105348> Nice work you almost got it. I would suggest looking at the properties instead of the data ;)   precodetell application "Pages"     tell front document         repeat with pg in pages             tell pg                 set im to images                 repeat with i in im                     tell i                         get properties                     end tell                 end repeat             end tell         end repeat     end tell end tell /code/pre  <comment123872> Thanks! (+1) With AppleScript you never know how close you are... :) Do you happen to know how to get the image's filename - there's no `image data` property in the listing of this script, although it's in the dictionary?
