Compose an Email with a Selected Email address in Apple Mail App <body> I want to compose an e-mail from my Mail Application on my desktop.  I have two e-mail addresses.  How do I select one, or make sure, that the email is being sent from one e-mail address and not the other?   I'm not replying to anyone, I'm composing a new e-mail.  Thanks!  I'm attaching the form field, it doesn't show an option to select which e-mail address to send the email from?img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3Hs86.png" alt="enter image description here"  When I click the box next to orders@myemail.com, my other email address doesn't show?  <answer130712> What is shown in the top part of the Mail app can be customised  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/K93My.png" alt="enter image description here"  Click on the box I highlighted and choose Customise. You will get a list of fields to show.  One of them is the From fields which is the one you want. Strictly with well behaved mail clients and users the Reply-To is really more relevant as that is the one a reply will be sent to However I find that some correspondants don't use it - I don't know why.   <comment153323> How do I customize it so it shows "From email@email.com"? <comment153325> The From field will allow you to choose from all your accounts <comment153349> I'm sorry, there's no option where you say it is?  I'm attaching a screen shot. <comment153355> I figured it out.  I have to click on the e-mails own individual inbox to get the email address to appear as the "from".
