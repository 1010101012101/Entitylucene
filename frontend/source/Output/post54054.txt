.bash_profile not running with multiple commands <body> I am having an issue with my code.bash_profile/code script.  If I simply have the line  precodesource ~/sh/bashmarks.sh /code/pre  the codebashmarks.sh/code script runs as expected.  However, if I add an alias  precodesource ~/sh/bashmarks.sh alias gs='git status ' /code/pre  I get the message:  precodeNo such file or directory/bashmarks.sh /code/pre  I should be able to add additional commands after I specify the script correct?  What could be wrong here?  <answer54055> That sounds like a line-endings issue. Make sure your bash file is using UNIX code\n/code instead of Windows code\r\n/code.  <comment61856> Indeed it was.  I am learning the Sublime text editor and the default line ending option was set to 'default' which I assumed meant LF.  Changing the setting to 'unix' fixed the issue.
