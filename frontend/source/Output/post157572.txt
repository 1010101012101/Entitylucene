How to fix MacBook HDD, keys out of order and disk full error? <body> I have MacBook late 2008 10.6.8 120GB HDD.  Lately its been kernel panicing once a week and last panic was really bad.  After panic, i booted and verbose log says this:  checking catalog file keys out of order (4, 18556) rebuilding catalog b-tree disk full error the volume macintosh hd could not be repaired (hfs) exited with signal 0  Then mac shuts down.  How bad this "keys out of order" thing is? How likely i lose some files?  So the problem is too little space in HDD. There is about 7GB space now and it is heavily fragmanted and it is HFS+ compressed by Clusters app. Filevault is off.  I plan to use target disk mode from old ibook 10.4.11 to delete some big and old files like Photoshop to make more space.  How much space rebuilding catalog b-tree requires?  I plan to make dd bit-by-bit backup and superduper bootable backup too. I plan to do superduper backup using ibook and target disk mode. Superduper which i can run under 10.4.11 is 2.7.1 and it was released before 10.6.8. Does that create any problems?  I found this from net. Is this correct code i should try in single user mode? sudo dd bs=512 if=/dev/rXX# of=/Volumes/BackupDrive/Macintosh HD.dmg conv=noerror,sync  I have lion in external usb hdd and i tried to boot from it by pressing option key down, but this hdd just beeps repeatedly and it appears in screen briefly and then disappears with kind of clouds animation. Lion would be newer than 10.6.8 so superduper would surely work but i'm not sure why it wont work.  Thanks for help  <comment185282> If you can first recover your stuff using target disk mode. After that you are free to do what ever- like reformat that drive.
