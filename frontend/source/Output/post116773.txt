I installed both GCC 4.9 and GDB 7.7.1 on Mavericks via Homebrew, but GDB does not work entirely correctly. I can set breakpoints, but cannot query the values of variables. GDB always reports that it `could not find the frame base` for some functions. Apparently many people also encounter the same problem. Would you please elaborate on how GCC and GDB were installed on your Mac? <comment166748> I installed it via brew. I don't remember the steps now, but did not struggle much. <comment166775> Thanks. I guess this kind of problem is very hard to resolve. <comment193162> I recently ran into this again and was able to make do by prefixing `sudo`, did you try that? <comment250749> I've followed these steps on Yosemite, and it still doesn't work. I can run gdb as root, however.
