Is there a way to change 3 finger drag to 4 finger drag <body> Is there a way of using third party software like Better Touch Tool to configure a 4 finger dragging gesture?  I want to reserve 3 finger gestures for many other actions.  <answer174570> In Better Touch Tool, I find these four-finger gestures... No four-finger drag, I guess.    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5Kj1i.jpg" alt="threefinger"  But to be sure you could try asking at http://blog.boastr.net/what-is-bettertouchtool/
