Vim like terminal <body> I recently discovered terminal's feature, you can set the keys emacs or vi style  I prefer the second. so if you do  precodeset -o vi /code/pre  You can use k j l h keys to navigate on the command line. And you can switch between 'Normal' and 'Insert' modes like in vim.  However there's no way to visually distinguish one mode from another, even cursor doesn't change. Which makes vi-style pretty much useless. Is there a way to make it truly vim-like?  <answer124426> ul liYou can switch from codebash/code to codezsh/code. I will not describe here how to set up mode indicator in Z-Shell – there are a lot of howtos over Internet, e. g.: [1], [2]./li liIf you’re using GNU Bash version 4.3 (most probably you are not, it was released last month, so you'd need to upgrade), you can set Readline option codeshow-mode-in-prompt/code./li /ul  Like so:  precodeset show-mode-in-prompt On /code/pre  in your code.inputrc/code or  precodebind 'set show-mode-in-prompt On' /code/pre  as a shell command. This adds a character to the beginning of the prompt indicating the editing mode: code@/code for Emacs, code:/code and code+/code for vi normal and vi insertion respectively.  I. e. your prompt will look like code+agzam@pc:~$/code in input mode and code:agzam@pc:~$/code in normal mode. As far as I understand this can not been customized in any way, but still it’s better than nothing.  <comment142192> You can look into ZLE settings (it is zsh line editor). it allows to edit every command line in external editor.
