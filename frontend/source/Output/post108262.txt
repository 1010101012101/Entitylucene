Can I configure terminal to show stderr output in different colour <body> Is it possible to configure the terminal in OS X to show codestderr/code output automatically in a different colour than codestdout/code output from a process?  Or is this only possible if the process is outputting coloured output?  <answer108265> You may want to have a look at stderred which allows to output Stderr in red.   It's OSX compatible and there is a manual to install it on OSX.   <answer108267> There is no straightforward solution, but there are at least a few workarounds available to do this.  ul liYou can install hilite by building the single C file (codehilite.c/code in this case) or by using codebrew install hilite/code (with homebrew installed on the system). Use it as codehilite &lt;command&gt;/code./li liYou can use the command from this answer on serverfault (substitute codecommand/code with the name of your script/command) to make stderr appear in red (for other colors, refer the ANSI escape sequences list and change the em31m/em in the below command accordingly):  precodecommand 2&gt; &gt;(while read line; do echo -e "\e[01;31m$line\e[0m" &gt;&amp;2; done) /code/pre/li liYou can use stderred to color stderr in red./li /ul  <comment133661> hilite can also be installed using homebrew:  `brew install hilite` <comment133664> Thanks. I updated the answer with this information (brew is a better choice to install it).
