How can I reset the PRAM if Recovery Mode keeps overriding the PRAM command? <body> Lion uses the kbd&#8984;/kbd + kbdR/kbd to boot into recovery mode. Resetting the PRAM in anything less than 10.7 was kbd&#8984;/kbd + kbd&#8997;/kbd + kbdP/kbd + kbdR/kbd.  Recovery mode now seems to override the PRAM command. Does anyone know if there is a new way to reset the PRAM now that Lion is installed?  <answer21035> Resetting the PRAM works the same way it always did.  This is a function of the hardware - not the OS.  What makes you think it doesn't work anymore?  (tested on Macbook, Mac Mini).  <answer32260> Nate , PRAM reset is not working because you turn on Password Firmware Protection. Turn it off and P+R+Option+Command will work.  <answer32296> Or she has spilt something on the keyboard and the shift key is telling the computer it's being held down, so no matter what, it will boot into recovery mode. I work for an apple specialist and see it all the time.  <comment23087> It's a matter of timing. You need to push these key immediately after turning on. If you wait too long, the bootloader is already active, which uses Cmd+R for the recovery function. <comment23138> I tried it 4 times on my wife's MacBook and it booted into recovery mode each time. <comment339687> If you have the option, try using a (different) external, wired keyboard. If the reset PRAM shortcut works, then maybe it's something with the original keyboard?
