Thunderbolt display "disconnects" after 17" MBP 2011 goes to sleep <body> My Thunderbolt display was working flawlessly until I upgraded my 2011 17" MBP to OS X 10.9. Now, when the MBP goes to sleep the display will not wake, the MBP wakes fine. The USB drive plugged into the back of the display is disconnected as well.   I have to unplug the thunderbolt cable and plug it back in.   <comment125104> I would promptly make apple aware of the issue: http://www.apple.com/feedback/macbookpro.html <comment133232> I see this issue on my 15-inch, Mid 2012 MacBook Pro as well.
