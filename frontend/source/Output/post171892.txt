How can I backup usb drive to img <body> If I have a bootable USB drive Yosemite Installer. How can I back up its data to img, so someday I can use dd to restore and install Yosemite.  <comment202318> Sorry, I've read this 3 times & still don't know what you actually mean. Could you edit for clarity. <comment202721> I have edited for clarity <comment202777> I'm still not sure what you want. You need to clone a Mac boot USB, so someone else can make a new bootable USB, on a Windows machine? I doubt win32diskimager could use a .dmg file, try transMac - see http://superuser.com/questions/383235/create-a-bootable-usb-drive-from-a-dmg-file-on-windows <comment203965> You understand what I wanna say,I use win32diskimager  write niresh dmg to usb drive,it can do what I say.However transMac is also OK,but first how to create such bootable dmg file? <comment203968> That would make this a Hackintosh question, which is off-topic for Stack Exchange. <comment204022> Let's hold this to clarify the problem. As Tetsujin has mentioned - supporting windows tools is a better fit for SuperUser and if this question gets enough details, I'm happy to migrate it there, but it's really not clear enough in present form to even know if it's on or off topic here thus the temporary hold. Please edit or [participate in meta](http://apple.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/participate-in-meta) to ask for assistance with this specific question's editing. <comment207081> I just wanna explain how to backup MBR PBR and partition data. It's not a mackintosh question.
