How to launch TextMate (and probably other software) from the command line? <body> I am very new to Mac, coming from Linux.   I am using TextMate, and I suddenly discovered I do not know how to launch TextMate from command line. Using completion, nothing looks like TextMate. Where is it located from a command line perspective?  Sorry for this odd question that also applies to other software, I guess.  <answer116341> For Textmate there is a command line tool, strongmate/strong, that can be installed. Once installed you just use codemate &lt;file&gt;/code to open that file in text mate.  For application that don't have a command line tool, you can use the codeopen/code command with the code-a/code flag and the name of the application. i.e.  codeopen -a iTunes/code  This also works for TextMate:  codeopen -a "TextMate 2"/code  The executable file is located in the app's Contents/MacOS subfolder, so for TextMate 2, it would be:  code/Applications/TextMate\ 2.app/Contents/MacOS/TextMate/code  But if you run it from the command line like that, it will hang the shell until the application is quit (on certain older OSs; this was resolved as of 10.8)  If this happens to you, put an code&amp;/code at the end of the command to background the process.  Such as:  code/Applications/TextMate\ 2.app/Contents/MacOS/TextMate &amp;/code  The problem with this is that if the shell exits (by quitting Terminal or closing the window) then TextMate is terminated without warning.  <answer277807> I have made this apps for myself.

Then exit out of the file, and then type `source ~/.bashrc` <comment349637> Welcome to Ask Different!
