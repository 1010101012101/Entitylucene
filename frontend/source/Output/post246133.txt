Input sources missing <body> All my input sources have disappeared.  I use Finnish, Japanese and Korean keyboards. For language switcher next clock on top menu-bar it shows "(NULL)" and "(NULL)" for Hiragana and Hangul input methods.  Other input sources like English are fine and still in place.  How can I re-install these?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sYvvT.png" alt="No Japanese input" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/R5o7q.png" alt="No Korean input" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/m9Uyj.png" alt="These are all ok"  <answer246134> System Preferences - Language &amp; Region - Preferred Languages  Click on the kbd+/kbd button to add a language.  Let us know if this worked? :)  <comment303391> Hi, these are all ok: http://i.imgur.com/0G8hL8A.png - All the input sources (keyboards) are missing. <comment303419> @koreanname01 Set up a new user account and see if you have the same problem when logged into that. <comment303804> @TomGewecke work on guest account, but not for my own. <comment303810> @koreanname01 That probably indicates a broken .plist in Home/Library/Preferences.
