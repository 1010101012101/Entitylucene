Disable auto-update of Google Chrome with Firewall? <body> I need to keep using an older version of Chrome to access an old work VPN which requires Java applets and for some reason crashes after several minutes when launched from Safari. The latest versions of Chrome has Java applets disabled, so I need to download an old version of Chrome and disable the autoupdate. I know you can disable the updater interval, but can I disable it by blocking certain domains in code/etc/hosts/code by pointing them to 127.0.0.1 or using Little Snitch to block connections?  <answer209919> From this link:  This works to stop Google Chrome from updating itself automatically in Mac OS X:  ul liLaunch the Terminal, found in /Applications/Utilities//li liEnter the following defaults write command and hit return:/li /ul  codedefaults write com.google.Keystone.Agent checkInterval 0/code  ul liExit out of Terminal and restart Google Chrome/li /ul  Direct Google search here.  YMMV.  <comment254251> Thanks! If I accidentally open the "About Chrome" box - will that still trigger the auto update? (I've read on the forums that this was the case at some point). <comment254266> No idea, @NicCottrell, sorry!
