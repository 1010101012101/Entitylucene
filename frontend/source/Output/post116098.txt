New MacBook Battery and charging <body> I bought a new battery as my old one cut out the system. Since installing the new one its been acting really strange. It's been sitting around 2-5% charge for the past few hours and now I've got it upto 11%. I've reset the SMC and the PRAM reset too and when I plug everything back up the MacBook run fine in start up then died due to the low % of battery.  As I said its at 11% just now and here is my log:  precodeBattery Information:    Model Information:   Serial Number:    W01107AW7D3BA   Manufacturer: TOP   Device Name:  A1331   Pack Lot Code:    3230   PCB Lot Code: 30db   Firmware Version: ddae   Hardware Revision:    dac2   Cell Revision:    2b39   Charge Information:   Charge Remaining (mAh):   589   Fully Charged:    No   Charging: Yes   Full Charge Capacity (mAh):   5500   Health Information:   Cycle Count:  2   Condition:    Normal   Battery Installed:    Yes   Amperage (mA):    -1564   Voltage (mV): 11225  System Power Settings:    AC Power:   System Sleep Timer (Minutes): 16   Disk Sleep Timer (Minutes):   0   Display Sleep Timer (Minutes):    16   Wake on AC Change:    No   Wake on Clamshell Open:   Yes   Wake on LAN:  Yes   Current Power Source: Yes   Display Sleep Uses Dim:   Yes   PrioritizeNetworkReachabilityOverSleep:   0   Battery Power:   System Sleep Timer (Minutes): 15   Disk Sleep Timer (Minutes):   10   Display Sleep Timer (Minutes):    15   Wake on AC Change:    No   Wake on Clamshell Open:   Yes   Display Sleep Uses Dim:   Yes   Reduce Brightness:    Yes  Hardware Configuration:    UPS Installed:    No  AC Charger Information:    Connected:    Yes   ID:   0x0100   Wattage (W):  45   Revision: 0x0000   Family:   0x00ba   Serial Number:    0x005b514c   Charging: Yes /code/pre  I was hoping someone could tell me from that if this battery is fine and just needs a proper good 100% charge or if I have to do anything else to the MacBook?  Thanks  <answer116902> Charger was replaced and now its working
