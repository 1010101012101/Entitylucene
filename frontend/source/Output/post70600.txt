Can Eudora be set to be the default mail client on OS X? <body> I was using Eudora for email on my Mac.  I just activated the Apple Mail application and now I can no longer receive new messages in Eudora.  I can send, but not receive.  I get an error message alluding to password error.  I can read the new messages in Apple Mail, but prefer Eudora.  Can I uninstall Apple Mail?  <answer70618> Yes.  Open up Mail.app, and visit the preferences (Menu BarMailPreferences).  Change the default mail client in the drop-down menu under "General" to Eudora.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qi4GP.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  If you really wanted, you could just drag Mail.app from your Applications folder to the Trash at that point, but I would just leave it and ignore it.  <comment81973> Could you edit your question to specify Eudora and OS X versions and perhaps a screen shot of the eudora error (or at least a precise wording) of what it says is the problem. <comment81987> In addition the title/goal (get rid of Apple Mail) doesn't directly match the problem (wrong password/connection problem) encountered. What exactly do you want to accomplish?
