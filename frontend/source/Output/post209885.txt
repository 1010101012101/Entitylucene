Pages: line break appears before end of line <body> For some very strange reason, I cannot seem to fit the text on line 2 inside the empty space of the 1st line. I tried deleting the words and re-writing them, which didn't work. I tried changing font sizes back and forth, still didn't work.  I couldn't find this bug being referenced anywhere...  In the animation below / screen cap, I am only using delete and text keys of the computer.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kXfn5.gif" alt="enter image description here"  <answer209888> This might be Non-breaking space between the words. Please press kbd⌘ cmd/kbd+kbd⇧ shift/kbd+kbdi/kbd to enable non visible characters. Here's example:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PJfjr.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment253194> Did you try to retype the space character between "altération" and "handicapante" as well? Might be a non-breaking one <comment253195> Yes, that helps since I do see these when pressing this key combination. But how did this weird space get there? I didn't do anything special, just type! And yet my document seems scattered with these <comment253197> Key combination to insert Non-breaking space is `⌥`+`Space`, maybe You did this by accident? Or this text was copied from other source? <comment253198> No, like I said, I just typed the text... Weird! I'll leave the invisible characters on to watch this strange phenomenon closely... Thanks a lot for your help!
