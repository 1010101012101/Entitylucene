Advertise app on mac app store <body> Is there a way to advertise my app on the mac app store similar to search ads on iOS?  <comment354174> Nope, Search Ads is iOS-only. <comment354196> Thanks. So you can't advertise an app in the mac app store anyway? Or is there an alternitive? <comment354218> You'll need to advertise your app in more traditional ways: think Google Adsense or similar.
