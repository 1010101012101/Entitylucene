Is it possible to restore contacts from a few days back <body> I honestly don't know what happened, but it appears that I lost a number of key contacts out of my address book. I didn't delete them manually, but regardless of what the cause was - they are gone.  Is it possible to restore contacts back, say from a few days ago?  Additionally, and this might be symptomatic of a bigger issues, some of my contacts appear in duplicate.
