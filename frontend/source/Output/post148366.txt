How do I silence FaceTime notifications without silencing others? <body> With FaceTime on my iPad now notifying me of iPhone cellular calls, it is important to be able to silence FaceTime notifications, without silencing others (such as alarms or reminders); but there appears to be no way to do this.  How do I silence — not disable, just silence — FaceTime notifications without silencing others?  <answer160184> The best you can do is configure the strongDo Not Disturb/strong settings. You can set strongAllow Calls From/strong to Everyone and then set strongSilence/strong to either always or only while iPad is locked and you should still get notifications but they will be silenced.  <answer225031> Either Settings  Notifications  FaceTime  Sounds  None or I have misunderstood your question. Do you mean to prevent the notifications from making noise or just dismissing a notification after its begun?  <answer247913> This seems to have the answer.... albeit a convoluted one!   http://www.quepublishing.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1873027&amp;seqNum=3  <comment273048> That's the opposite of what the original poster asked. <comment305911> Welcome to Ask Different!
