Macbook Pro GPUs: overheating and noisy fans <body> I'm sure everyone with a Macbook Pro has experienced the heavy heating and the fans sounding like they are about to take off. It's totally understandable when I run a GPU-heavy process such as video editing or gaming. My problem is that this is happening even with simple tasks such as web browsing or watching a video...  My understanding is that it is due to the Intel CPU doing all the work to save energy. Am I wrong? Then why even have a dedicated GPU! It's a shame that the algorithm to switch from CPU to GPU is not smart enough to avoid the overheating issues.   So I have two questions:  hr  ol liI've read that the Automatic Graphics Switching box in ParametersEnergy Savers lets you control if you want CPU/GPU or only GPU for all graphical computations. In the CPU/GPU mode, some algorithm (whitelist?) decides whether an application should run on the Intel or Dedicated GPU. Apparently it can't tell that Chrome should run on GPU rather than burning my laps... Is there a way to edit that list?/li liWhat is your software of choice to monitor/control this behavior?  Do you manually check/uncheck the box throughout your day? I'm trying out strongiStats Menus/strong which seems great for monitoring usage. I've heard about stronggfxCardStatus/strong, is it usefull? And finally i've read about various strongfan control apps/strong but is it really a good idea to prevent the CPU from cooling down?/li /ol  hr  This seems to be a case of Apple trying to hard to simplify something that really wasn't complicated: nowadays if you're buying a laptop with a dedicated GPU you probably understand well enough the difference between the Intel on-chip GPU  and a dedicated GPU performances to make this kind of decisions.   Thanks for your help!  <answer255627> Have you tried resetting the SMC?  strongReset the SMC/strong  It's easy to reset your computer's System Management Controller (SMC). The instructions for resetting the SMC on a MacBook depends on two things:  ul liDoes your device run from a removable battery? /li liDoes your device run from a built-in battery?/li /ul  Now, because you haven't specified your model of MacBook Pro, I will provide the process for both.   strongFor MacBook Pros, MacBooks etc that you can remove the battery from, here’s what you do:/strong  ol liShut down your computer/li listrongDisconnect/strong the MagSafe plug (power cable) from the computer/li liRemove the battery/li liPress the kbdpower button/kbd for 5 seconds and release/li liPut the battery back in/li liReconnect the MagSafe cord (or power cable)/li liTurn your computer back on with the power button/li /ol  strongFor MacBook Pros, MacBook Airs, and MacBooks where you can’t remove the battery on your own (i.e. it's a built-in battery), here’s what you do:/strong  ol liShut down your computer/li liKeep the MagSafe adapter (power cable) strongplugged in/strong./li liPress at the same time kbdshift/kbdkbdoption/kbdkbdcontrol/kbd (on the left side of the keyboard) strongemand/em/strong the kbdpower button/kbd/li liLet go/li liTurn your computer back on with the power button./li /ol  Hope this helps. Please report back and let us know.  strongReset your PRAM/NVRAM/strong  Older Macs had what's called Parameter RAM (PRAM), newer Macs use Non-Volatile Random-Access Memory (NVRAM). It may be worth you also resetting this. Here’s how to:  ol listrongShut down your machine./strong Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out./li listrongPress the kbdpower button/kbd emand then/em press the kbdcommand/kbdkbdoption/kbdkbdp/kbdkbdr/kbd keys./strong You have to make sure you press these keys before the gray screen appears or it won’t work./li listrongHold those keys down/strong until your Mac reboots again and you here the startup chime./li listrongLet go of the keys and let your Mac reboot normally./strong/li /ol  strongNote:/strong When you log back in you strongemmay/em/strong need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. mouse speed, time and date/timezone, etc).  <answer255643>    I'm sure everyone with a Macbook Pro has experienced the heavy heating and the fans sounding like they are about to take off.   Sure, but depending on what the Macbook is doing it could be normal behaviour. Also some Macbooks heats more than others. What's yours?  Anyway, there are two possible situations:  strong1) you always experienced heating and loud fans:/strong  I would say it's normal behavior (but you can always try what suggested at strong(2)/strong if you feel it's really too much heat/fans)  strong2) heating and lound fans started at some point during the life of your macbook:/strong  Try to fix the problem  ul limake sure the macbook can cool down normally (fans exhaust grid are not obstructed)/li lireset the SMC (see other answer)/li liuse strongActivity Monitor/strong to check if there is a connection between overheating and specific application/processes/li libring the macbook to apple service center/li /ul  hr     My problem is that this is happening even with simple tasks such as web browsing or watching a video...   Web browsing pages that use strongFlash/strong or intensive JavaScript and/or watching videos can be CPU/GPU strongintensive tasks/strong.  hr     My understanding is that it is due to the Intel CPU doing all the work to save energy. Am I wrong?   Yes, you're wrong.  Macbooks Pro have an integrated GPU (integrated into the CPU) and a discrete GPU.  The difference between the two is that the integrated GPU heats less, drain less power but has limited features and computational power than the discrete.  When possible the OS uses the integrated GPU to save energy. When not possible (ex. you're using photoshop, you attach an external display,... ) the discrete is used and the MBP heats more.  You can see what GPU is used with stronggfxCardStatus/strong  The strongEnergy Saving/strong GPU option tells the OS that you want to use the integrated GPU whenever possible.  <answer285754> I first quit the dropbox app, because according to the activity monitor, that app used a lot of CPU. It helped, the noisy fans were a bit less erratic, but still they went on making noise and my mbp got hot. After I deleted all obscure apps (that sometimes come with visiting a website), it is all back to normal.   <comment318387> Can you please provide the actual model and specs of your MacBook Pro? <comment318391> Just because the GPU has switched on, doesn't mean that it'll get hot. Have you tried an SMC reset? Check in Activity Monitor to see if there is a process that is using more CPU usage than expected. <comment318568> Please limit your posts to one question per post. That said, your second question is actually more like 4 questions, and software recommendations are [off-topic](http://apple.stackexchange.com/help/dont-ask).
