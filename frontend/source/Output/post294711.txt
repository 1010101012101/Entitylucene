How do i fix left click mouse behavior for Logitech M720 Bluetooth mouse? <body> I'm seeing the following symptoms on OS X Sierra:  After a duration of time, my Logitech M720 Triathlon Mouse will register all left clicks as a left-ctrl click. This results in web links being downloaded instead of opened - etc etc.   Turning off the mouse does nothing.  Turning off Bluetooth seems to reset to default behavior.  How do i determine whats causing this issue?   <answer294732> I occasionally experience this behavior with my G700s. I think it's a problem with the Logitech driver/utility (if you happen to use it). I suggest you update to the latest version; it was released just a few weeks ago.  Now that I think of it, I haven't had that problem in quite some time, nowâ€¦  <answer295394> This is a work around.   Turning off bluetooth, and turning it back on fixes the issue. The challenge was that i have an external mouse and keyboard that use bluetooth to connect.   Turning off bluetooth left me unable to turn bluetooth back on.   To do a full cycle reboot of bluetooth, i did the following.   Install http://www.frederikseiffert.de/blueutil/  precode$ brew install blueutil $ blueutil power 0 &amp;&amp; sleep 10 &amp;&amp; blueutil power 1 /code/pre  This turns off the bluetooth radio, waits 10 seconds, and turns the radio back on. Upon bluetooth radio restart, the symptoms are fixed.   <comment372227> Im running latest
