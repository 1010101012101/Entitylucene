Notes saved as a document? <body> Can I save a Note I created in my documents?  I don't know how to saVE A NOTE to my documents or elsewhere, I have tried all I know.  I know there is textedit, but I have had it lose some important docs and don't trust it.  I would use it if someone could tell me how to find a doc that wasn't saved then computer shut down.  In word it at least auto saves.   Thank you in advance B  <answer154280> You can Export a Note as PDF file.  or you can copy/paste in to word document.
