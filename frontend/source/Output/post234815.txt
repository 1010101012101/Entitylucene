What does a star next to a song in the Music app in iOS indicate? <body> What does the star next to track #2 and #3 indicate in this screenshot?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zkGFu.jpg" width="300"  <answer234817> Looks like it indicates a song's popularity.     @rjonesy It's an indication of the song's popularity in the iTunes   Store.   https://twitter.com/AppleSupport/status/720277245865107457  <answer234833> @SteveMoser is not incorrect, it's also the star rating that you've given a song/disc.  While listening to a song, tap the artwork.  From there you can give it 0-5 stars.  The stars will show-up next to the song, like in your image.  <answer275727> It means that either Apple has used this song, or, it means it is a popular track.   <comment287149> I just tried this out and it doesn't seem to correlate. Maybe you can show a screenshot with more than one star next to a song in the album list view? <comment287151> It won't show more than 1 star next to it.  Every song/album I've "star'd" has the star next to it.  Maybe I just star popular songs? <comment287160> It would be awesome if you could make a short video of rating a song on your device and a star appearing. But I understand if you can't. <comment287165> My free Apple Music subscription expired so I can't access it anymore, sorry. <comment346910> Welcome to Ask Different and thank you for your answer.
