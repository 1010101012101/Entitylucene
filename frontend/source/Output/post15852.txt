How many HD video minutes do I get per 1GB of free storage? <body> I have 7GB free. If I give that to someone to record, what sort of ballpark figure would I get for a HD video recording? There may be about 10 individual videos being recorded over a couple of hours, if that makes a difference. Maybe just one hour long one.  I just want to know a rough figure but ideally with some maths so I can work it out myself.  <answer15863> The iPhone 4S takes video at 1080p and 30 fps and initial tests are showing that video takes 200MB per minute. At roughly 12 GB per hour, what seemed staggering a year ago is now quite quaint with the iPhone 4 recording at less than 5 GB / hour.  MacWorld reports that an hour of iPhone 4 video is 4.8 gig.     The iPhone records its 720p HD video at around 10 megabits (Mbps) per second. That translates to about 80MB per minute, as we noted above, or a staggering 4.8GB per hour. (Hope you sprung for the 32GB model!)   <answer80289> It's impossible to estimate without looking at the footage first, or at least having a description of what will be shot (a crowd of people running around at Grand Central or 2 people sitting on a bench), the lighting conditions (night, with no lights, or day), the way it will be shot (on a locked tripod or over the shoulder, panning left and right like a maniac), etc...  <answer106346> 1gb from a  ul liWebacm-30 mins/li liiPhone 5s-55 mins/li liiphone 5-45 mins/li liiphone 4s-30 mins/li liiphone 4-27 mins/li liiphone 3gs-23.5 mins/li liiphone 3g-17 mins/li liiphone 2-6 mins/li liiphone 1-3 mins/li licamera-1.25 hour/li lifilm cam-3 hours/li /ul  <answer159291> I just made a 15.5 minute test video with my iPhone 5S. File size is 1.31 GB, or 85 MB/minute. 7 GB of storage would handle 82 minutes of video.  Of course the complexity of the video and audio should have an effect on the compression, so this is just a rough guideline.  <answer242334> It is scientifically proven that 1gb will take a 58 minute video for an iPhone 6.  <comment17255> Somewhat a duplicate of http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/15642/ipod-touch-4g-video-and-music-capacity <comment17365> No, I didn't get that version but I have way enough space to capture what I need - thanks! 4.8GB! Wow! Apple didn't mess about there! <comment17383> Doesn't look like a duplicate to me, @jmlumpkin. But it sure is related. <comment17391> That "hope you sprung" was from the article. I'm perfectly happy with my 14 GB iPhone 4. <comment17396> The reason I think it is a duplicate is the update to the question. <comment298055> This answer makes no sense as written.  Did you mean to say *a 58 minute video will take 1GB of space?*  Now, where is this "scientifically proven"?  If this is the case, you should provide links.  Also, what resolution?  I would bet a lower resolution would take less space than a higher one,  wouldn't it?
