Accessing Java Applets on website in iPhone 4S <body> Is there any way, strongwithout jailbreaking/strong, to open java applets  on websites on an iPhone?  I want to open a java based online ssh service (applet) : http://www.cryptzone.com/products/agmindterm/  I will be using it from Usermin (Webmin).  Is there a strongfree/strong solution?  <answer33511> Java applets are not supported on iOS.  <answer66629> You would have to use a cloud browser or a VNC client to your PC.  <comment38144> You mean: running java applets on the iPhone? <comment38343> Is there absolutely NO WAY whatsoever to open applets like the above? <comment38348> Applets will NOT work. There might be solutions that use Java **Script**, but that is a whole different world and would require programming on your end.
