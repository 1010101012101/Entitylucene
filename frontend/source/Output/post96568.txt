Installed and uninstalled apps LOG on ipad <body> Can I view all the installed and uninstalled apps on my iPad?  Say I want to find out versions numbers and other details of an app I uninstalled / installed last week. Can I do that someway with a log or some sort of history viewer.   <comment113372> The app is a 3rd party app, and not installed through App store. <comment113376> How do you install apps without the Store in the first place? <comment113390> We can get installation files straight from some developers. Just click on a link, and the app installs.
