How do I view emoji in Google Chrome in Lion? <body> This question is an extension of Daniel L.'s question and my own question. I upgraded to Lion after asking my question. I'd like to be able to view emoji in Chrome when using Lion.  So stuff like this:    I'd like to be able to see in Chrome. How do I do this? If possible, I'd like to use the system font that's already included on OS X Lion.  <answer43946> This isn't exactly what you're looking for, but it should actually work, which is an advantage.  Create a service in Automator. The service takes strongno input/strong.  Two actions.  h2First action:/h2  strongRun AppleScript/strong Here's the script:  precodeon run {input, parameters}     tell application "Google Chrome" to activate     tell application "System Events" to tell application process "Google Chrome" to set myvar to value of text field 1 of tool bar 1 of window 1     if myvar contains "://" then         -- do nothing     else         set myvar to "http://" &amp; myvar     end if     return myvar  end run /code/pre  h2Second action:/h2  strongWebsite Popup/strong  Assign it a keystroke and you're good to go.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LDI5l.png" alt="enter image description here"
