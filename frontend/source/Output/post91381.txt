How can i reset my Terminal? <body> just some time ago i installed the OS X Server app on my mac and since this day it always appears codeserver/code as the chosen directory in my terminal.   But because i dont really like the Server application i just removed it but the codeserver/code in my terminal is still left.  So i wonder now how i can get the default back like codeusers/.../code  I am running mountain lion on my mac.  I am a real newby to both mac and usage of terminal but i need it know for some work and i just get errors every time i am trying to enter something.   <answer91396> Goto your strongHomeFolder - Library - Preferences/strong and delete the file : emcom.apple.terminal.plist/em  That should reset the settings on your Terminal   <answer99273> emSince you have mentioned that running codepwd/code shows a path not mentioning codeserver/code, I believe you are mistaking codeserver/code for being the directory when it is actually the hostname./em  OS X Server will change your hostname (by default) to codeserver.&lt;name&gt;.private/code, so Terminal will show codeserver:~ username$/code (in Bash with the default prompt).  To change the hostname, you can use the following command:  precodesudo scutil --set HostName yourhostname /code/pre  supReplace emyourhostname/em with your preferred hostname/sup  <answer186951> System terminal:  precodedefaults delete com.apple.Terminal /code/pre  iTerm2:  precodedefaults delete com.googlecode.iterm2 /code/pre  <comment107312> what does `echo $HOME` returns ? Or maybe you have something in you .profile or your .bashrc_profile that changes the Default Working Directory. <comment107331> If the full prompt is like `server:~ username$`, you can [change the hostname](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/88463). If it's just `server` or something, check your `~/.bash_profile`. <comment107335> echo home returns /Users/username <comment107336> I can not find the terminal.plist i.e. it does not exist in my preferences libary <comment107342> What does running `pwd` show? <comment107356> From the Finder menu bar, select **Go ▹ Go to Folder** and copy the following line into the text box that opens:       ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Terminal.plist <comment107516> `pwd` returns the same `/Users/username` <comment107517> I removed it but it does not change anything. Tried to even reboot after removing and install+uninstall the server app but nothing changes. <comment131870> The file is `com.apple.Terminal.plist`. <comment131871> @swe19 — No, `echo home` certainly does not return `/Users/username`, it does return `home`. Computers are delicate and picky.
