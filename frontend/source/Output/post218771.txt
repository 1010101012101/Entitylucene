Two itunes accounts on one laptop <body> My wife and I have two separate iTunes accounts and two separate laptops.  Now that we are married, when it came to the time we both needed to replace our own laptops we decided just to buy one.  I would be grateful for any advice on what the best way would be to deal with our separate iTunes accounts.  Can we merge them, or both have our own iTunes accounts installed on the same machine.  Any advice would be much appreciated.  <answer218772> You should each have your own user account/login on the computer then you can have each use your own iTunes, iCloud, email, Facebook, Twitter, etcâ€¦ accounts.
