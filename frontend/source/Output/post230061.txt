How to restore macbook from icloud? <body> I've bought new macbook after hdd crashing of previous one. Is there a way to restore data without repairing old drive? I know that backups of iOS devices are storing at iCloud. What about mac os? I need to restore files only. I dont remember was backupping setted up on previous machine. If setting it is necessary - how to do it?   <answer230070> iOS has the option of backing up to iCloud.  OS X can use iCloud Drive to maintain remote synchronised copies of some data. For everything else, you need to have been using Time Machine locally, or a paid online backup solution such as Backblaze for disaster recovery.  It is your responsibility to ensure these are active &amp; up to date.  With no backup, then you need to be looking at data recovery solutions. Whether that is software such as Disk Drill or Data Rescue or a dedicated [&amp; expensive] Data Recovery Service depends on the actual cause of the HD 'crash' &amp; the value of the lost data.
