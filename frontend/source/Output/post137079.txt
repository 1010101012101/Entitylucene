Applescript to set Track Comment to Rating <body> I'm trying to develop an applescript that sets the comment tag to the track's rating.  i.e., if it's a 3 star track, I want the comment to say "3 Star".  precodetell application "iTunes"   set theTrack to (item 1 of (get selection))   set comment of theTrack to theRating end tell /code/pre  This isn't working for me.  Any Ideas?  <answer137083> First thing is that the rating value is just stored as "rating". But iTunes stores the star rating as a value between 0 and 100, so you need to convert from that value to the number of stars.  There might be a smarter way to do this but this code seems to work.  precodetell application "iTunes"     set theTrack to (item 1 of (get selection))     set theRating to rating of theTrack     if theRating = 100 then         set comment of theTrack to "5 Star"     else if theRating ≥ 80 then         set comment of theTrack to "4 Star"     else if theRating ≥ 60 then         set comment of theTrack to "3 Star"     else if theRating ≥ 40 then         set comment of theTrack to "2 Star"     else if theRating ≥ 20 then         set comment of theTrack to "1 Star"     else if theRating = 0 then         set comment of theTrack to "0 Star"     end if end tell /code/pre  <comment162794> Perfect. Thanks a lot.
