Syncing sunrise calendars on multiple devices. <body> I've added events to the sunrise calendar app on my iPad, and the new events don't sync with the sunrise app on my computer. How do I fix this?  <comment193038> What is the Sunrise Calendar app? Please provide a link. What have you tried so far? How does it sync (iCloud, Dropbox, proprietary, etc)? Have you contacted the developer for assistance? <comment193041> Here is the link:  https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sunrise-calendrier-google/id599114150 <comment193042> The calendar is synced with my google account (among others like dropbox), so when I add an event (or anything else) to one device, shouldn't it automatically be updated on the other device? <comment206949> This also happens on my android phone.
