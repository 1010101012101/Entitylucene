Save a file with the extension I want <body> In Chrome, when I download a file with an extension that the OS doesn't recognize (in this case, code.erb/code, the dialog defaults to appending code.txt/code to the end of it. I highlight the .txt and delete it before hitting save, but then I open the directory and find codefoo.erb.txt/code where I should find codefoo.erb/code.  How do I get the system to save the file with the extension I told it to?  <answer96454> Apparently this is a chrome bug that's been around for some time and never seems to have been fixed.   Several bug reports are available but I haven't ever seen a fix or even a chrome extension that fixes it.  I think if the web server identifies the content or mime type correctly it might work, but looks like there's nothing you can do about that from the browser-side of things.   http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=38213 http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=39708&amp;q=download%20filename%20extensions&amp;colspec=ID%20Pri%20M%20Iteration%20ReleaseBlock%20Cr%20Status%20Owner%20Summary%20OS%20Modified
