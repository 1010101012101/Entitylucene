Rails Command Fails Because of Space in Path <body> I tried setting up a Ruby on Rails project on my nice safe volume called "Data RAID". The set up failed with some strange errors that I eventually tracked down to the space in the path name. It works if I execute it on another volume. I tried setting up a symlink to the directory, which works fine with the cd command, but doesn't help with the set up. Is it possible to get an application to use a symlink or other method that avoids the pathname with a space?  The Terminal command I'm running that errors out is  precoderails new projectnamae /code/pre  One other twist is something I set up to specify the location of the gems:  precodemkdir ~/.bundle touch ~/.bundle/config echo 'BUNDLE_PATH: vendor/bundle' &gt;&gt; ~/.bundle/config /code/pre  It is with the gems that I'm getting the error.  <comment117007> @tubedogg, thanks for suggesting the changes. I rejected them because they didn't look right in the change panel. In the end, I think I made all the same changes on my own. <comment117008> I was kind of confused about that, yes. :)
