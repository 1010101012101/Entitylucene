Copy cells' content w/o adding quotes - Apple Numbers <body> I want to copy text from a cell, exactly as it is. However, Numbers (3.6.2) put quotes around my text.  strongExample:/strong     This is text inside a cell.   When trying to paste the string that I've just copied into TextEdit for instance, I'm left with this:     "This is text inside a cell."   Any way to prevent Numbers from doing that?    <comment327342> Why do you think it's Numbers and not TextEdit that's adding the quotes (when it recognizes a text string)? <comment327346> Cause I can paste it no matter where and it already has the quotes. <comment327382> I just tried to reproduce this in Numbers 4.0.5, but it did not happen. Is there a reason you're not updating Numbers? If not, try updating the app. <comment327467> I seem to have found the issue. Some of my cells included line breaks. Only text of those were quoted. Try reproducing that.
