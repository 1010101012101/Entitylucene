unable to download updates on the Mac App Store <body> There are several updates for apps I have installed, but whenever I try to download them, I get the following message     This update is not available for this Apple ID either because it was   bought by a different user or the item was refunded or cancelled.   I have never asked for a refund, or canceled a purchase, and I only have one Apple ID.  I'm in Belgium, and so my mac switched to the Belgian App Store. But when I tried to download the updates, I first got the message "This Apple Id is only valid for making purchases in the Dutch App Store."  So I switched to the Dutch App Store, and then I got the message above.  Two questions  ul liWhy does Apple care from which country I'm downloading FREE updates?/li liHow do I fix this./li /ul  <comment178777> I don't remember the error message, but when connected through mobile the App store doesn't work. Maybe not your case, just for the records.
