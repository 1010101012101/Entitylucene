Specifying $MANPATH after installing coreutils doesn't affect the man page displayed <body> I installed the GNU core utilities via codebrew install coreutils/code. I also added codePATH=$(brew --prefix coreutils)/libexec/gnubin:$PATH /code to the beginning of code~/.bash_profile/code (and it's auto-sourced in code~/.bashrc/code) as to enable accessing these utilities with their default names, ant not prepended with codeg/code.  I also want access to the codeman/code pages of these utilities, so I added codeMANPATH="/usr/local/opt/coreutils/libexec/gnuman:${MANPATH-/usr/share/man}"/code to code~/.bash_profile/code as the second line. Unfortunately, when I type codeman ls/code for example, I still get the BSD man page, instead of the Gnu one. How do I fix this?  <answer248991> OK, so after researching about code$MANPATH/code with regards to Linux\UNIX, I came across the idea of adding codeexport MANPATH/code right after defining it in code~/.bash_profile/code. This solves the problem as required, i.e. giving me access to codeman/code pages for codecoreutils/code, and only then to their BSD versions, if no GNU version exists.  <comment308618> .bash_profile should source .bashrc i.e. the opposite way to the way you have said https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Bash-Startup-Files.html but that is probably not the issue <comment308619> what does `echo $MANPATH` show? <comment308620> @Mark /usr/local/opt/coreutils/libexec/gnuman:/usr/share/man <comment308622> What happens if you- `man gcat`? <comment308624> The I get the man page for GNU cat.
