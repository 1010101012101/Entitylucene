iMac software causing I phone messages to appear up on older iMac <body> Just upgraded older iMac with neatest software.  Now my spouse's text messages show up on iMac.  Her iPhone software is old and she cannot turn it off from her iPhone. Is there a way to turn it off from the iMac?  <answer180632> Open the "Messages" App on the iMac, go to settings and remove the iMessage account.  <comment214573> Welcome to the site.
