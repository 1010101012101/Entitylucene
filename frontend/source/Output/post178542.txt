"problem connecting to server" when trying to access local disk <body> Ever since I have upgraded to Yosemite, I get two pop-up windows with error "there was a problem connecting to server" when I try access one of my two hard drives through Finder. I dismiss the errors and the Finder window appears OK. I then don't get these errors for some time and then I get them again - and always two errors  It seems the access request goes through NAS which fails   "NetAuthSysAgent[11958]: ERROR: AFP_GetServerInfo - connect failed 62"   and NetAuthSysAgent[11958]: GetStatus: connecting to self not allowed"   but then it gets actioned as a local access. Can anyone think of why NAS gets involved? And mainly how to get rid of it :^).  There is nothing in login items that mounts either of the disks as a server.  <comment211471> This is not an answer but I do notice that from time to time and I have always thought that there was an alias somewhere that the Finder was trying to resolve. But I am just guessing here. Never been real happy with Apple networking, always seemed slow connecting to shares compared to Windows.
