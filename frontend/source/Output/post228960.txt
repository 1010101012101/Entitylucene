Is there a limit to amount of bluetooth devices connected to a MacBook Pro? <body> Problems arose today when I connected the 5th bluetooth device to my MacBook Pro.  ul li1 new Apple keyboard/li li1 new Apple trackpad/li li1 old Apple keyboard/li li1 old Apple mouse (most recently connected)/li li1 Beats Wireless/li /ul  After connecting the mouse, I suddenly started hearing skipping through the headset whenever I clicked keys on a keyboard or moved the mouse around. Reverting back to 4 bluetooth devices "fixed it". Interestingly, using the Trackpad did not have the same effect.  Any thoughts on how to fix this? Or is this simply a hardware limitation?  Due to pair programming I actually do need to have all devices connected (although I can use a cable for some if this is a codewontfix/code).  <answer228962> Here's the info from Apple site:     strongConnect multiple Bluetooth devices to one computer/strong      The official Bluetooth specifications say seven is the maximum number of Bluetooth devices that can be connected to your Mac at once.   However, three to four devices is a practical limit, depending on the types of devices used. Some devices require more Bluetooth data, so they're more demanding than other devices. Data-intensive devices might reduce the total number of devices that can be active at the same time.
