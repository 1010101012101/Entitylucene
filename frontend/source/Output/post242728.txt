Turn off non-Wifi Internet access on iOS <body> I want to use internet only via Wifi, and be asked if I want to use the internet via my SIM (3G or so).  How can I do that? Is there a setting for it?  <answer242729> you can turn off cellular data (or your internet over your SIM) when you go to Settings-Cellular (or Mobile data) and then turn of Cellular data. Or in Romanian: Configurari-Conexiune celulara and turn off Date celulare  this way you'll use only your wifi connection (if you're connected to WiFi).  <comment298674> Is it the same with "Mobile Data"? I cannot find "Cellular" in my settings. I'm using iPhone SE. <comment298677> what software version do you have on your device? you can see it on Settings-general-about <comment298678> I'm using `9.3.2 (13F69)`. <comment298679> Then you should have Cellular in settings... Is your SIM card in the phone? <comment298680> Yes, it's there and everything works fine. I just want to make sure this won't eat my `$` when I'm not connected to WiFi. It's my first smartphone. :) <comment298681> No problem :) there should be Cellular in Settings for sure, I have 3 iPhone SE's in front of me with this version. <comment298682> I uploaded few screenshots here: http://m.imgur.com/u2RlYSI,EAJ0dSA,wmXTJLb,fGfZNnn,timbsnJ <comment298683> Then it's mobile data in your case :) <comment298685> OK, thanks :) Don't forget to update your answer with that, then. I asked a new question, maybe you can help there as well: http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/242739/87092
