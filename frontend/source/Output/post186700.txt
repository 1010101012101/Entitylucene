Cable lock with Mac Mini <body> How do I use a cable lock with my Mac Mini? It doesn't appear to have any mounts for the typical cable lock. Do I have to get an enclosure and secure that to the desk?  <answer186705> Yes, you need an enclosure to use a Kensington lock.  As you can see Mac Mini doesn't have a pin lock.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lnBSn.jpg" alt="Mac Mini rear"
