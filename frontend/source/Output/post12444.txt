How do I change GNU Screen's meta-key to Cmd-a? <body> GNU Screen's default meta-key is kbdCtrl/kbd-kbda/kbd, which is really inconvenient for me because I frequently use kbdCtrl/kbd-kbda/kbd and kbdCtrl/kbd-kbde/kbd to move the cursor to the beginning or end of the line.  I'd prefer to change this to kbdCmd/kbd-kbda/kbd instead. I know this can be changed in my code.screenrc/code file, but how do I encode the kbdCmd/kbd key?  <answer12446> I generally think the command idea is a bad one, because it is intended to be the system key for app manipulation. kbdCmd/kbd-kbdl/kbd appears to be unbound in the application menus, but I couldn't use any tricks to view what it's keycode may be. Thus, I would suggest kbdShift/kbd-kbdCtrl/kbd-kbda/kbd.  Having said that, if I understand the man page, and a resource on the Ubuntu Forums on the topic, I believe you can change it to Shift-Ctrl-a either by using the -e flag (which I suggest you use to test with before putting it in your code~/.screenrc/code).  You should be able to run codescreen -e ^AA/code. code^/code is a common identifier for "Ctrl", and A means capital-a (shift + a), as opposed to a lowercase a, meaning the character by itself.  If that works, you should be able to add a line into your code~/.screenrc/code that says: codeescape ^AA/code for it to automatically take place on any standard execution of codescreen/code just by itself.  <answer92782> run 'cat' in a terminal and press cmd-a to see what characters it sends. You can then use that in your .screenrc  <answer92787> As usual, I would also recommend trying out tmux. It's kind of a "screen on steroids". It uses codeC-b/code as its prefix key, but even that is configurable. codetmux/code allows you to easily configure every aspect of it. As per the codetmux/code FAQ, you can change the prefix to codeC-a/code like this:  precodeset -g prefix C-a unbind C-b bind C-a send-prefix /code/pre  Of course, since you wanted to get rid of codeC-a/code anyway, you may be happy with codeC-b/code instead.  You can easily install codetmux/code if you have MacPorts installed, by running:  precodesudo port install tmux /code/pre  <comment13007> I assume you use Ctrl-a too often to get used to Ctrl-a (release ctrl) a to send Ctrl-a to the shell? - The problem with Cmnd-a is that it is the builtin for "Select All Text", which I am not sure how you will be able to undo. <comment13009> @VxJasonxV hmm, I may be able to live with Ctrl-a,a but yeah I will probably mess it up too often. If Cmd-a won't work I'd settle for something like Shift-Cmd-a. <comment57034> Also see http://superuser.com/questions/142680/bash-vs-gnu-screen-replace-ctrl-a-with-ctrl-shift-a <comment108814> Welcome to the site! How does this differ from the other answer? If it does, can you please elaborate your answer a bit to make it easier to understand and follow? <comment108883> Thanks, for the record I have long since switched to tmux.
