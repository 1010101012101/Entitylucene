restore deleted iPhone backup - iTunes <body> I deleted by mistake the latest backup for my iPhone directly in iTunes preferences. I want to recover it. How can I do this ? I look into User/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/BackUp and it is not there anymore. Where could I find the deleted folder containing my latest backup ? I have a MacBookAir ElCapitain with iPhone 5C 9.3.5  Thank you very much !!  <answer251125> You might get lucky &amp; find it in the Trash - otherwise iCloud, Time Machine or recovery software...br ...though I wouldn't hold high hopes for that, my current iPhone backup folder contains strong43,181/strong items, all with catchy, memorable  names likebr code0d0c1bdbcfa1d8f0cde357e7a4ab3db7783e26ff/code  <comment312181> Thanks for your answer. I found in the Trash a -ipsw file but I cannot open it... I didn't empty my trash and I don't use TimeMachine or iCloud (shame on me...). I know the beginning of my file name but i don't know where to find it... Does iTunes has a special folder where the deleted stuff are in there ? <comment312191> The ipsw, is just the iOS update - you can get a fresh one of those any time from Apple. Your backup is thousands of cryptically-named files, there will be nothing recognisable in there. <comment312314> Ok thank you... I can't recover my deleted backup then...
