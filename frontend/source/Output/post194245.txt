Stop prompting to unlock disk <body> I have two hard disks on my 2012 Mac Mini. The first disk is partitioned with Mac HD and Data HD. The second drive has OS X Public Beta and Windows partitioned.  I want to prevent OS X on my main disk from auto-mounting OS X Public Beta and Windows 7. Both are encrypted (FileVault 2 and Bitlocker).  I tried to edit /etc/fstab and /private/etc/fstab which seem to be replicated but it doesn't work. I thought I was doing something wrong, so I added a line for Data HD which is not encrypted and it didn't mount.  sudo vifs  UUID=NUMBER none hfs ro,noauto  That's the line I'm issuing for Public Beta. I'm assuming its not hfs because of FV2 so is there another file system I need to enter? I also tried hfs+ and it didn't work, I still get prompted to enter passcode.  For Windows 7, I'm assuming I would use ntfs? I'm not using BootCamp so I don't think it would be fat.  <answer194272> Instead of using codeUUID/code try using codeLABEL/code. This will help to rule out UUID problems.  The following line in code/private/etc/fstab/code stops the drive named strongSpareSSHD/strong from mounting on OS X 10.10:  precodeLABEL=SpareSSHD none    hfs rw,noauto /code/pre  My drives are encrypted with FileVault2 and this works.  The following links provide more detail:  ul liHow can I tell OSX NOT to mount some of the drives in my computer?/li lifstab(5) manual/li /ul  code/private/etc/fstab/code and code/etc/fstab/code are the same file. As @forquare confirms, they are symlinked. You can edit either.  <answer194293> Try 'xx' instead of rw or ro. Since a FV2 drive doesn't mount until you unlock it, the rw,ro won't do anything.   <comment231621> Why don't you just keep the drive turned off until you need the Public Beta or Windows? <comment231668> You are correct they are the same file, `/etc` is a symlink to `/private/etc` as you can see here: `lrwxr-xr-x@  1 root  wheel    11B Oct 20  2014 etc@ - private/etc` <comment263747> I'm on OS X 10.11.1 with a configuration like this, and it isn't working for me. I tried using the LABEL form, with the "Volume Name" from Disk Utility, and all the UUIDs associated with it. I still get a "Enter a password to unlock" prompt upon login, though this `fstab` change prevents the disk from actually mounting once I enter the password to unlock it. Is there another way to do this? Or something else that needs to be used for the LABEL?
