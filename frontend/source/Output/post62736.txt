Can the Safari 6 omnibar search be changed from google.com to google.co.uk? <body> How can I change it so when I search using the omnibar it searches google.co.uk and not google.com.  For example when I want to look at prices for a product, I use the omnibar to search google but it shows me prices in dollars as it is looking results in google.com.  I would like to show results from google.co.uk to get localized search for the UK.  <answer62743> I installed a extension, called Keysearch. So that you can config some keywork to do the search. Fo example, you can config a keywork 'gguk' for google.co.uk, and in the ominibar, you can use gguk plus what you want to search.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z1qZF.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer62750> Glims will let you define any search engine as the default, along with many other great features&nbsp;&nbsp;:)  It is not an extension, but a plugin. Agreed, this is not as good as native, but is a one-time install with much less runtime overhead than extensions.  <answer63313> Just delete all your google.com cookies (not the google.co.uk ones) and it will magically start working!

This worked.
