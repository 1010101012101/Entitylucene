Is it possible to downgrade an ipad 2,4 without shsh blobs saved? <body> (iPad running iOS 9.3.5, have ubuntu 16.04 LTS and Windows 10 machines)  I tried doing so using odysseusOTA (back when I thought it was an iPad 2,2), but alas, it is an iPad 2,4.  Am I boned or is there a thing I can do?  Links to existing articles work if someone already answered this.  Alternatively, is there a way I can put another OS on this thing?  It's functionally useless at this point, so I'm not worried about bricking the bloody thing.
