Remove eject button from finder <body> I accidentally ejected an external drive in the finder, is there an option to hide or remove/disable eject button from finder?   <answer157609> You can use the command below to edit the com.apple.finder preference.  precodedefaults write com.apple.finder ProhibitEject true /code/pre  that will set it for the current user, to set it system wide use  precodesudo defaults write com.apple.finder ProhibitEject true /code/pre  The eject button will still show in finder but will not do anything when pressed.  <comment185295> Let me take a crack at this, Daniel.    "I **don't** want to accidentally eject an external drive when I'm in the Finder, is there an option to hide or remove eject button from Finder windows?"    Is this correct, @IAmJulianAcosta? <comment185310> defaults write com.apple.finder ProhibitEject true <comment185327> Thank you, is possible to do this only for one drive? <comment185329> Not that I can think of easily.  If you don't mind opening it from terminal all the time you can hide the external drive and it won't show in finder at all. <comment302469> Is it possible to disable ejecting just for one certain drive?
