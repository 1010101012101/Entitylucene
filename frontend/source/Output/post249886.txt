Is it safe to wrap Mac cord with a cloth? <body> Okay so the cord from the brick has teared a bit and the charger only works on certain angles lol..   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/E6Mui.jpg" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KoUGg.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  So what i did to hold the cord together was tying a cloth around it. I wanted to know is that safe? Or should I tie an IDE cable?  <answer249891> I'm assuming that you are referring to a Macbook brick.   The thin (low voltage) side is either 14.5V (Air) or 20V (Pro). I don't know about the USB-C connector.   Cloth strongMIGHT/strong be safe on the low voltage side if just the covering separated, but if it has to be in a specific position to work, you probably have a broken wire as well which could lead to sparking under the wrong conditions.   The only emtruly/em safe thing to do is replace your adapter. You can use proper electrical tape until then, but it should only be a temporary measure.  If it's on the other side of the brick, replace immediately.
