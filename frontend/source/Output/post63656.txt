How to create a binary plist file from the command line on OS X? <body> I am looking for a solution to create a binary plist file from the command line on OS X?  I want to create the code~/.MacOSX/environment.plist/code and setup the codePATH/code there.  I know that this plist file has to be in the binary format and I know how to write to it using the codedefaults write/code command. Still, I do need to create the file before doing this, and creating an empty file does not work.   Note: I need a command line solution.  <answer63660> This piece of bash solved my problem:      precodeif [ ! -f '~/.MacOSX/environment.plist' ]; then   mkdir -p '~/.MacOSX'   defaults write ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist TEST_VAR 1 fi /code/pre  Still, I have to warn others that OS X 10.8 seems not to be loading the file.  <answer63664> You could also create an XML or old-style property list and convert it with plutil:  precodeplutil -convert binary1 test.plist /code/pre  It modifies files in place by default. You can specify a different output file with code-o/code or print to stdout with code-o -/code.
