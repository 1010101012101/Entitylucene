How to enlarge the reading pane font in Office 365 (Outlook)? <body> The font is too small on the reading pane of Outlook 2016. Is there a hack to enlarge the reading pane font? I've had Macs for years but then Helvetica Neue font is too small for me.  <answer198115> While in the reading pane of Outlook 2016 click strongFormat   Increase Font Size/strong or press kbdcommandâŒ˜/kbdkbd+/kbd on your keyboard.  This should increase the font size of the message content in the Reading Pane.  <comment237021> This does indeed work.  Command - will decrease it. Unfortunately this is not persistent and Outlook does not remember the setting.  However the OP can send Microsoft some feedback regarding the issue.
