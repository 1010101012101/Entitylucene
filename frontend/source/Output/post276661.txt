Can you connect two pairs of airpods to one computer at once <body> I would like to watch a movie with a friend, but silently. Can we each use a set of airpods at once? If not, what about other wireless headphones?  <answer280946> I don't have a pair of Airpods to test this with but it worked perfectly with a bluetooth speaker and my headphones.  ol liPair both Airpods to the computer. You need to be able to select them separately as Outputs in System Preferences - Sound - Output (Set the output volume for each Airpod now as you can't set it once you select the combined device. You can always switch back to the individual ones and change their volume before going back to the combined one)/li liOpen Audio MIDI Setup in Applications/Utilities/li liClick the + at the bottom left and select Create Multi-Output Device/li liCheck the boxes next to both Airpods (or any other 2+ output devices)/li li(Optional) Rename the output by clicking on the name Multi-Output Device in the list/li liSelect the new device you created from the volume menu or from the Sound System Preferences./li liEnjoy sharing audio with your friend./li /ol  <answer294561> Bose has a "Music Share" feature which allows one Bose device to share its audio with another. Open the "Bose Connect" app and click the icon that looks like 2 headphones.     Share your favorite music or audio with a friend by streaming it between two Bose headphones.   <comment348272> I believe this might be a duplicate.  If not surprised <comment348379> I believe it "might" be a duplicate too, but that doesn't help me very much. <comment353464> Airpods can be paired to any device as standard Bluetooth headphones, including older Macs: https://9to5mac.com/2016/12/19/how-to-pair-airpods-bluetooth-devices-pc-mac/ <comment364334> I should have said: Thank you! I'm sure you are right and that it would work with two AirPods as well as two of any bluetooth devices.  - I'm just also hoping for someone to confirm it works with two AirPods, just cuz.
