Cannot add applications to favorites bar in Finder <body> I am a new Macbook user, which is exciting but alas confusing as well. I am trying to add favorites in the side bar under Finder. I read that one can just drag and drop from Applications as in this thread - How can I add new folders to the Favorites in the Finder sidebar?.  However, when I have done it, it does not stick and the icon just goes back into the Applications list as if I have not done anything.  Does anyone know what I might be doing wrong or why this isn't working?  Thanks!  <answer211826> You can only add favorites strongDirectories/strong to the finder sidebar.  But you can add some favorites applications on the strongDock/strong : https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201730  <answer211853> Although this tip does not add Application Alias' to the Sidebar, they can be added to the toolbar.  h3Add Application Shortcuts (Alias') to the Finder Toolbar/h3  ul liOpen 2 Finder Windows (From Finder use kbdâŒ˜/kbd+kbdN/kbd)/li liBe sure one of them is showing your Applications Folder and both can be seen on screen together/li liUsing the other Finder Window, right click or kbdoption/kbd+click in the toolbar area and select strongCustomize Toolbar.../strong from the dropdown.
