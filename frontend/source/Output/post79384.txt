Audio balance changes randomly in MacBook Pro Retina 15-inch' mid-2012 <body> I'm having some strange issues on my MBP Retina running OS X 10.8.2.  The audio balance changes, and the right speaker is almost muted.   Anyone know what could be wrong here?   <answer80279> I have this exact same issue. mid-'12 rMBP 15'' 256/2.6/16GB. OS X 10.8.2  First noticed the sound issue with my ear monitors (Shure headphones) plugged into the computer: the sound in my R earbud was like 80% diminished. But the earbuds worked fine on my iPhone 5, perfect output in each side. Last night, while watching a Netflix movie (occasionally plugging in my earphones into the rMBP), the laptop's R speaker suddenly lost all output. I freaked out, obviously, but quickly discovered that the balance bar had been shifted 90% to the L. Funny how that just changed itself mid-movie watching. Also, after I fixed the slider bar and the laptop's speakers started functioning as normal, when I plugged my earbuds back in, I had to go BACK into Audio preferences again to change the balance bar. Strangely enough, it was shifted L again, but more like 50%, not as extreme as it was for the laptop's speakers themselves.  Absolutely a software bug.  <answer90260> I've had this problem on multiple MacBooks (from my old Powerbook 15 from 2003 to prior to finding this question on my late 2011 MBP 13").  Apple has acknowledged it as a bug when pressing the volume buttons during heavy CPU usage way back in OS 10.2! The solution was to go back to preferences and set it back where you wanted.  <comment91686> Could you verify that this i not caused by a broken jack cable? Try replacing the cable between your mac and your speakers. If it's broken and you move, it might lose the signal of one channel. <comment91710> Yeah, sure, I've already checked this. I've tried with earphones/speakers and mac own speakers, so when I check the balance on the system preferences  Audio and the balance bar shows it has been changed to left... oddly enough <comment91761> Do you use Skype or some other VOIP program?  While in a call, these usually only play audio from one speaker to avoid interference with the microphone.  Perhaps it's related to this. <comment91919> Nope, I've checked that too, and I don't even have Skype installed on my machine... <comment93625> I'm having the same problem w/ my 13" retina, but it goes to the right.  I've yet to isolate the behaviour.  I don't have a cinema display like some other threads have suggested, but I do use an external display. <comment103565> I have the same issue w/ my 15" MBP Retina. Hope Apple comes out with a patch for it soon! <comment104499> I also have a retina macbook pro 15" mid 2012, and am experiencing the same bug. I was googling to see if I was the only one, but apparently I am not. For me, it faced 1/4 towards the right speaker. I only notice when I listen to music and feel like I'm not positioned correctly for the sound. In the settings, I can place the slider back to center and it works for a few days. I do not use external speakers, only headphones. I also airplay to apple TV. <comment109489> I'm having the exact same issue with my MBP Mid-2010 "13. I noticed it a few days ago whenever I plugged in my speakers or headphones, and I thought it was a headphone issue until I decided to check the sound balance, and it was almost completely to the left. It's happened several times, and it seems as if it does it every time something is plugged into the headphone jack. It has to be some weird bug that Apple has yet to issue a patch for! <comment201984> Control + volume buttons adjust the sound balance. This might be it. <comment242150> This has been so confusing, thank you. <comment355815> Thanks for this. Apparently is still happening on MacOS Sierra, as I had to re-center the balance for the millionth time :) <comment356924> This is one of the most annoying bugs I can remember of (probably just below kernel panic crashes). So how much it's been? 10 years without a fix?
