Mac OS X runaway process: AuthBrokerAgent <body> I'm trying to pinpoint the problem with a runaway process on my Mac (Lion 10.7.2) and I have a hard time finding any kind of info about that process on the Internet. It is simply called codeAuthBrokerAgent/code. I would like to know what is its function.  I'm not a developer and I didn't installed the developer tools on my Mac.  Thanks a lot!  P.S. I've already started a thread on Apple Community forum.  <answer36769> Problem solved. The codeAuthBrokerAgent/code is responsible for handling proxy credentials. If the credentials of a proxy setup are improperly stored (for example in one's keychain) then the codeAuthBrokerAgent/code can runaway.  More details and context on a follow-up posted on Apple Community forum, but the solution was to clear out bad user/passwords from the keychain and use Safari to re-ented the correct user/pass for the web proxy and check the box to have Safari save the password in the keychain.
