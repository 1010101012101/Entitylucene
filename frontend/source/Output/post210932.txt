What happened to my macros after update to Word for Mac 14.5.7? <body> AutoUpdate loaded the Office Service Pack 14.5.7. When I open MS Word, my macros are no longer there. I tried restoring my Normal.dotm file from   ~/Library/Application Support/Microsoft/Office/User Templates/  Just realized that custom AutoCorrect entries still exist. I had assumed that they would be missing too.  Still no macros are showing up. Is this a bug or am I missing something?  <answer211264> Turns up that the Office update changed my preferences in MS Word. Previously templates had been stored in   precode~/Library/Application Support/Microsoft/Office/User Templates/ /code/pre  When AutoUpdate ran, the location changed to   precode~"UserName"/Library/Application Support/Microsoft/Office/User Templates/ /code/pre  <comment254646> please edit your question instead of adding a comment. <comment254682> Thanks for good tip, IronC, and for being gracious! Good example.
