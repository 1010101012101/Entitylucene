How can I dismiss a frozen "Deleting Trash" dialog box? <body> I have the trash dialog box up, and it's frozen. What process needs to be killed in order to remove it, without having to restart?  <answer67115> Try codekillall Finder/code in Terminal.app.  <answer147184> Relaunch the Finder if you don't want to use the terminal. Apple menu  Force quit...  Finder  Relaunch.  <answer215614> If you want to stop ONLY the Empty Trash process, open the strongActivity Monitor/strong utility and strongforce quit the Locum process/strong.  Enter your admin password when requested.  <comment79110> wont that close all open programs in finder? <comment79111> it will only stop the finder, no other apps. since the finder is what is frozen, it would be what you have to kill <comment79115> Perfect! Thank you. <comment182581> This worked, easier to use than terminal for most users. <comment268622> I don't see Locum. Has is been renamed?
