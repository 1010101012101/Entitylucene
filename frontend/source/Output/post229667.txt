Need to boot my MB Air (mid 2011) to an external monitor <body> I broke the display on my MB Air.  I can't see anything on the screen except for the top right hand corner which shows the percentage of the battery and the keyboard icon.  I have an external monitor connected via thunderbolt and a keyboard connected via USB.   I've tried doing fn CMD F1 and CMD F1 at boot but the monitor remains blank.   Is there a way for me to set up the monitor when I can't even log in to the computer to get to the display settings?  Please help!!!
