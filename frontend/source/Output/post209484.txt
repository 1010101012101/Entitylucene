Attaching External HD to Airport - Is It Secure? <body> I am thinking about attaching an external HD to my Airpot (ac), which I will use to back up my computer using SuperDuper on a nightly basis. However, I am concerned about security. I know that I can set a password to access the disk. But is the disk available via the internet? I'm concerned that someone outside my network might be able to access the disk.  <answer209495> Disks connected to an Airport router aren't, by default, accessible from the Internet. This is for a few reasons:  ol liYour ISP is almost certainly running firewalls that would make it hard to do this anyway./li liBy default, disks are only accessible from your local network./li /ol  That said, it's empossible/em to make a disk accessible from the Internet if you want to - see this post on the Apple support forums. If you don't specifically take those steps, the disk won't be publicly accessible.
