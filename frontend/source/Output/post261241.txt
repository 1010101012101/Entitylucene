Missing Favorites Font Collection <body> This is long. I hope that not only can someone straighten me — or rather my computer — out in a way that will be useful to other people, or that some of the information here will be useful in its own right.  In the Show Fonts dialog there is an empty "Favorites" collection. In Font Book there is no Favorites collection. In ~/Library/FontCollections there is no Favorites.collection.  ul liWhere is the "Favorites" in the Fonts dialog coming from if I don't have a Favorites collection?/li liIf I create a collection called "Favorites" it is just a regular collection in the middle of my others. It does not appear with "All Fonts", "English", and "Recently Used". In fact, there is still a "Favorites" before "Recently Used", but it is still empty./li liApple documentation says "Mark a font as a favorite: Drag a font from the Typeface column to the Favorites collection in the Collection column. Or select a font, click the Action pop-up menu [gear image here], then choose Add to Favorites." I see no gear image anywhere, there is no "Add to Favorites" in the contextual menu, and Font Book Help shows no hits for "Favorites"./li liI think the gear menu is supposed to be at the bottom left of the Font Book window. All I have there is a plus — I don't even have a minus, so all in all things are looking highly suspicious./li /ul  On the other hand, other Apple documentation makes it seem that you have to create your own Favorites collection. (Search for "Organize fonts as collections" to see where the documentation shows adding a Favorites collection. But then again, that page must be pre-Yosemite (?) because it shows things I don't have in the Font Book: specifically a "Computer" and "User" collection.
