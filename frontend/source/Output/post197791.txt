No bootable disk when booting Windows after installing Linux on Mac <body> That must the weirdest title you've read in a long time.br I have a MacBook Pro Mid 2012, I installed Windows 7 with Bootcamp and all was working fine.br Last night I installed Kali Linux with a bootable USB, and during the installation I checked something like "master boot record" or something like that, not too sure. Now when I'm greeted with the boot menu in mac thanks to coderEFInd/code and select Windows, this message comes on :       No bootable device -- Insert boot disk and press any key   I've read online this has something to do with GRUB, but don't know how to proceed. Let me know if you need any more info, thanks.  <answer198355> https://youtu.be/BmMR5lJAtnw I saw here and i always fixed my problem   <comment236655> Was this the [window](http://i.imgur.com/HxpKaDI.png?1) where you checked: *something like "master boot record" or something like that*. BTW, did you install using a LVM? <comment236775> Yes that's the screen. LVM ?! I don't think so <comment237320> Hi KArs, while this link may answer the question, it is better to include the essential parts of the answer here and provide the link for reference.
