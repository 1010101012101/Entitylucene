Where do I find my user folder in the OS X folder hierarchy? <body> In Terminal, how do I go from strongMacintosh HD/strong to places such as strongjohnsmith/strong that contains Downloads, Desktop etc. In a Finder window, it seems they are independent of each other.  From Macintosh HD, I see Library, Applications etc. but under User I couldn't find johnsmith.  The Mac file tree is rather confusing for a Windows user like me who are used to "My Computer" then all files are managed by root drives and folders. What is consider as root on my Mac? Is it Macintosh HD or johnsmith? It is possible to do a partition on Mac like that on Windoes?  <answer51281> OS X is Unix-based so there is only one big filesystem visible to the user, even if it is distributed across several partions. This also applies to external drives which are accessible under code/Volumes/NAME-OF-DRIVE/code.  The individual user home folders (which contain all the nice stuff like Downloads, Documents etc.) are available in code/Users/code, each user has his/her own directory there with a name matching their short name. Type codels -l /Users/code in Terminal to see all of them.  And to actually "go" there, enter codecd ~johnsmith/code (for user codejohnsmith/code) or just codecd/code (for your own home folder), followed by codels -l/code to see the content.  <answer51282> To find where it is, open Terminal and type codepwd/code for "Print Working Directory". This works because the Terminal opens in your home folder by default.  You can move to your home folder in terminal by typing one of codecd/code (defaults to your home folder), codecd $HOME/code (moves to the location in that environment variable), or codecd ~/code (a shortcut for home), or codecd /Users/johnsmith//code (the absolute path).  <answer51300> To get path into Terminal without a lot of typing:  •Open a Terminal window.  •In Finder, navigate to the folder (or file) you want, and drag its     icon onto Terminal window.  •The appropriate path string will appear in terminal window.  <answer51317> You can find the location to your home directory by looking in the "Users &amp; Groups" System  Preference pane.  ol liOpen "System Preferences" application/li liClick "Users &amp; Groups"/li liClick the padlock to unlock it, if it is not already unlocked. Enter user name and password for an Admin user./li liRight click on the User name you want to find the home directory for, select "Advanced Options..."/li liObserve the path as noted next to "Home directory:"/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/a7Y9v.png" alt="System Preferences:Users &amp; Groups: Advanced Options"  Now, once you see where OS X thinks your home folder is located then you can work on un hiding it if it is not showing up where it is suppose to be.  Make sure its name does not start with ".", Additionally you can use the codeSetFile -a v /pathToHome/code command to make it visible if it appears to be hidden for no apparent reason.  <answer186471> Normally, your user folder is located at code/Users/johnsmith//code.  However for the case that you are in Recovery Mode, your user folder is located at code/Volumes/Mac/Users/johnsmith//code. This is because Recovery Mode is like another operation system started from another disk partition, so the disk partition with your main system appears as a mounted volume (like an external hard disk does normally).  <answer252102> Very easy solution:  In "Finder", choose "Preferences". Click on the "Sidebar" tab, and under the "Favorites" column, there should be your user name (usually your name: "firstlast"). Check the box. Now when you open finder, you should see your user name, and when you click on it, you will see the directory of all your files. :-)  <answer271753> Your home directory should be /User/$USER  $USER is a variable so it is not really $USER  Type in the terminal "echo $USER" and replace $USER in the first line of my answer with the output, that's your home folder.  <comment58615> in my User's there's only "Shared".... <comment58616> Strange indeed, can you share a picture? In addition, open a Finder window for your home folder and Command-Click on the window title to show the folder hierarchy it resides in. <comment58648> Mac OS X with one hard disk is like Windows with one hard disk. Your home directory is at /Users/johnsmith. <comment58653> Also, report the results of `echo ~` -- that should print where your home folder is. <comment58692> The folder may be hidden. You could try `SetFile -a v /Users/johnsmith` in Terminal to make it visible again. <comment313634> Peter, the question is specifically about finding the User folder *inside Terminal*.
