How can I switch to an open tab in Safari using osascript? <body> Trying to switch tabs in Safari with codeosascript/code. I have tried multiple versions of the following:  precodeosascript -e 'tell Application "Safari"' -e 'keystroke "2" using command down' -e 'end tell /code/pre  Tried replacing "Safari" with "System Events and "2" with "-2". But nothing I do is working. Can someone tell me what I'm doing wrong?  <answer237167> It's System Events that handles the emkeystrokes/em.  In normal AppleScript the emcode/em would look like:  precodetell application "Safari"     activate     delay 0.5     tell application "System Events"         key code 19 using command down     end tell end tell /code/pre  As an codeosascript/code command line, it would be:  precodeosascript -e 'tell application "Safari" to activate' -e 'delay 0.5' -e 'tell application "System Events" to key code 19 using command down' /code/pre  The codeosascript/code command line from above shown below as multiple lines for clarity:  precodeosascript -e 'tell application "Safari" to activate' \           -e 'delay 0.5' \           -e 'tell application "System Events" to key code 19 using command down' /code/pre  strongNotes:/strong Before telling System Events to emkeystroke/em, the emtarget/em of the emkeystroke/em must have focus. So first, Safari must be made the frontmost window with codeactivate/code. You must then allow a moment for it to have focus before the emkeypress/em and that is done with codedelay 0.5/code and the value of codedelay/code may need to be adjusted in emseconds/em and or emdecimal fractions/em thereof. So once Safari is the frontmost window, then System Events can issue the emkeystrokes/em.  emThis of course assumes Safari is already open with at least one window having two tabs!/em  The emkeystroke/em used herein with Safari is a Safari 9 (El Capitan) keyboard shortcut as shown in: Safari 9 (El Capitan): Safari keyboard and other shortcuts     Select one of your first nine tabs &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Command-1 to Command-9   <answer237227> Use the codekey code 19/code command, because the codekeystroke "2"/code command simulate the key code 84 (numeric keypad) instead of key code 19.  precodetell application "System Events" to key code 19 using command down /code/pre  To know the key code of some key, download this application -- https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/key-codes/id414568915?mt=12  hr  But, you do not need strongGUI Scripting/strong to select a tab in Safari, use this script  precodetell application "Safari" to tell front window to set current tab to tab 2 -- this select the second tab /code/pre  <comment290356> This isn't working for me. It works if I manually press Cmd 2 but otherwise it just stays on the same tab after safari activates. I tried delaying for 4.0 and still nothing. <comment290357> You need to allow setting the tab via cmd-number in settings of safari under the `tabs` setting <comment290361> I've done that. If I manually push it on the keyboard it works fine. But nothing happens with the script. <comment290363> @Seamus, I'm not sitting at a system that's running OS X 10.11 and Safari 9 to test this however later today I can test this under OS X 10.11. This works under OS X 10.8.5 when substituting the appropriate keystroke and I assumed the same paradigm would work, sorry.  Also the `delay` doesn't need to be 4.0 and typically 1 second of fraction thereof is adequate. <comment290372> I appreciate your help. Yeah the 4 second delay was overkill but I just thought I'd try it to rule out the possibility. It is strange. It works just fine using the same format with letter presses like `'keystroke "a" using command down'` so I don't see why this would be any different. <comment290412> Just to add for the sake of clarity: I am using Safari 9.1 on Mac OS X 10.11.4. as well as Bash 4.3. <comment290451> Thank you both of these examples work. Quick question - How would it be phrased if the command uses 2 or more keyboard modifiers like command and alt at the same time? <comment290461> Never mind I got it. In case anyone else needs this its `osascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to key code "19"  using {option down, command down}' -e 'end tell'` Thanks for your help. <comment290463> @Seamus, you do not need to use `-e 'end tell'` when the `tell` statement in in the `to` form.  In other words `tell application "AppName" to ...` negates the need for an `end tell`.
