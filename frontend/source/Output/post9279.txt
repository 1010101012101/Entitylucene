Conditional SUM() based on text of a cell using iWork <body> I have some basic data  precodeName | Amount Jake | 10 Jake | 12 Jake | 13 Ben  | 1 Ben  | 14 Ali  | 9 Ali  | 4 /code/pre  I want to total up the codeamount/code for each person so I end up with something like  precodeJake | 35 Ben  | 15 Ali  | 13 /code/pre  Rather than specifying which cells are Jake's, Ben's and Ali's I want to do this using a function. Pseudo code might look like:  precodeTOTAL = WHERE `Name` IS "Jake" IN `COL-A` + `Amount` /code/pre  <answer9285> It would appear that codeSUMIF()/code does exactly this  precode =SUMIF(test-range, “test”, [sum-range]) /code/pre
