What does photolibraryd do whenever I log in to my Mac? <body> Whenever I log into my MacBook Pro the CPU cranks up to 100%+ for a few seconds, my board gets hot, and the fans start going.  I open up Activity Monitor to find that the culprit is 'photolibraryd'.  What's going on?  What's it doing that uses so much CPU?  <answer270780> In my case photolibraryd wants to conntect to edge.quantserve.com on Port 80 (http), probably to set a tracker-cookie or web-beacon. I stopped this behaviour with Little Snitch.  For more information on quantserve, read this guardian-article: https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/apr/23/quantcast-tracking-trackers-cookies-web-monitoring  <comment222325> Did you recently update? If so, there's a chance the new Photos application is doing some optimization magic. Have you tried letting it run overnight? <comment222383> Admittedly it only lasts for a few seconds each time I log in (long enough for the fans to make lots of noise), but it breaks up others virtually silent operation.  I suppose it's not a huge deal but if I can find out more about it maybe I can prevent it. <comment222450> Maybe iCloud sync stuff? <comment222482> With that much CPU?  Seems a bit much... <comment222511> I assume you have iCloud activated and Photos set to sync? If so it's easy to test because you can deactivate some of that stuff, restart and see if it still  happens.
