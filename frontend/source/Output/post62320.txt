Mountain Lion won't wake up after an extended sleep <body> I've recently upgraded my MacBook Air to Mountain Lion. Now whenever the machine sleeps for a long time (more than two hours or so) while disconnected from the mains, it won't wake up.  I had to hold the power button to reboot the machine.  Is there a solution to this problem?  <answer62326> I encountered the same problem, maybe you can try the following ways to wake up your Mac.  Hold the power button for two seconds, then release the button, not until reboot.  If this way does not work, try this:br Adjust the light button F2, maybe just the screen does not light.  Good luck!  <answer63182> This is a known issue that hasn't been fixed as of 10.8.1. When Mountain Lion hibernates (either directly or as part of standby mode), it couldn't wake up and thus need to be restarted.  The current workarounds are:  ul liDisable hibernate mode./li liDisable standby mode./li /ul  I've written an article how to get around this issue by preventing OS X from hibernating.
