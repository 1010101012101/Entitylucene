Is it possible to exclude bad memory? <body> I have a MacBook Air 2012 (A1466) and it developed some memory errors. It crashes every half an hour and Apple Hardware Test says      4MEM/9/40000000: 0x79eea590   Unfortunately, RAM is soldered on the motherboard and it is not replaceable.  I made some research and I have found that it is possible to tell operating system to ignore wrong memory addresses if you use Linux: Ubuntu Forums: Exclude Bad Memory   Is is possible to somehow exclude faulty RAM addresses in Mac OS X?  I currently use Yosemite (10.10) but I am willing to downgrade if necessary.  <comment281854> I have about the same problem. I've 16GB RAM in my MacBook and it seems like not even 56k of it are defect. I definitly don't want to pay a lot of memory to replace everything. I just want that bad memory to be flagged for not using (or somehow blocked)
