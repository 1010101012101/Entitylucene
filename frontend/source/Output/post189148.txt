iPhone 5c won't stop blocking a caller <body> My iPhone 5c keeps blocking a certain caller without my knowledge. I keep having to go in and unblock the caller's number; her name and number appear in the blocked list again and again without my having asked for her to be blocked. I have never requested her number be blocked, so what gives?  <comment224193> The blocked list actually works in conjunction with the carrier, you will likely need to contact the carrier as this is a likely a problem on their side.
