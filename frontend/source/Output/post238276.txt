When I text someone, they receive it from 2 numbers <body> Whenever I text or iMessage someone, they recieve it from both my number from my old phone that I transferred over, and the number on this phone. How do I make sure only 1 number is in use?   <answer238291> Open the Settings app. Then, go to the "Messages" section. Then, tap "Send &amp; Receive".  After that, check to make sure that you only have one number checked.  <comment292159> Welcome to ask different.  It's helpful to provide the device you are using and  the iOS version.
