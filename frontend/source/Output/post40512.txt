How do I share a post in the Facebook app for iPad? <body> My mom uses the Facebook app for iPad and wanted to share a post, such as on the web interface:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sabqv.png" alt="FB Share"  How does one share a post within the app?  <answer40513> Unfortunately, the Facebook for iPad app does not allow this in the native app.   One way to do this on the iPad is to log into Facebook from Safari and share a post as you would from any web browser.   Another possibility is the strongFriendly Plus for Facebook/strong app. I'm not sure if it allows sharing of posts, but it does say in the release notes for version 3.5.3 that it "fixed share issue" so it's a possibility. Worth $.99 I'd say.  <answer40514> You cannot re-share posts from the iOS Facebook app.   You can re-share posts if you:  ul liBrowser to https://www.facebook.com/ in mobile Safari/li liLog in/li liClick the three bar icon in the upper left hand corner to bring up the side bar  /li liScroll to the very bottom of the side bar/li liClick the "Desktop Version" link at the very bottom of the side/li /ul  This will give you the full Facebook desktop web view and from here you can re-share posts in your timeline.  <answer55765> Google post to facebook marklet- its a copy of the web page post to facebook JavaScript. Keep as bookmark, activate in browser when on page you'd like to post. Pop ups cannot be blocked tho. A new tab will pop up with the familiar posting window (provided u r loogged in tuo fb or have nactive cookies!)  <answer74011> The latest version (5.2.2) of the Facebook app has added support for the share button.     New Share link to re-post stories from your news feed   <comment45821> I would like some verification on the app you mention. If anyone has used it, please let me know if this works! <comment45822> Yeah, unfortunately I don't own an iPad (yet) or I'd try it out myself. <comment45823> Good workaround.
