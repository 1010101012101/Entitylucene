Will recompiling bash to avoid Shellshock cause more harm than good <body> I wasn't particularly worried about Shellshock until I learned that a malicious DHCP server may be able to exploit my DHCP client to run arbitrary code on my system. It's not clear to me whether Macs are vulnerable, but if so, I want to fix it ASAP.  That said, the version of code/bin/bash/code on my Mac is code-signed by Apple.  precode$ spctl --verbose --assess --type execute /bin/bash /bin/bash: accepted source=Apple System /code/pre  If I follow these instructions and replace Apple's code/bin/bash/code with one that I compile myself (hence emnot/em code-signed by Apple), am I setting myself up for trouble?  <answer147163> Macs don't use Bash for DHCP, so that particular vulnerability does not apply. Unless you run a vulnerable web server or have restricted remote access accounts, it's not worth the trouble to recompile Bash on OS X.  <comment173480> I wasn't sure whether Macs use Bash for DHCP. Glad to hear they don't! <comment246834> You could get a developer ID and sign the re-compiled `bash` as yourself.
