SIPS: Only Resize if Image is 315x300? <body> I'm currently using codesips --resampleHeightWidth 250 300 "S1"/code to resize new images in a folder but I think that it might be resizing images that were already resized.. Is there anyway to know this for sure?  If not what do I add so I can only resize images taht are 315x300?  <answer107657> Here is a bash script to check the size before :   precode#!/bin/bash  #theFile given in input    theFile=$1            #using sips to retrieve the width &amp; height             size=($(sips -g pixelWidth -g pixelHeight theFile | grep -o '[0-9]*$'))                        #the size you want width=315                                                                                        height=300  if [[ ${size[0]} -eq $width &amp;&amp; ${size[1]} -eq $height ]]; then                                         #put here your command for files that are 315*300                                                          fi                                                                                                 /code/pre
