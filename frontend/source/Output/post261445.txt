"You must update to iOS 8.0" when trying to download apps on iPhone 4 <body> I go to download my apps on my phone and it won't let me. It just comes up with this:     This application requires iOS 8.0 or later.br   You must update to iOS 8.0 in order to download and use this application.   I go to update my software and it says there are no updates available. What should I do?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/W1Tox.jpg" width="320"  <answer261446> The last version of iOS that the iPhone 4 supports is iOS 7.1.2. You will not find any more software updates for the iPhone 4 beyond this.  This means you are unable to install any apps that require a more recent version of iOS (not all apps require iOS 8 and later), however it may be possible to download a previous version of an app that does support iOS 7 by adding the app to your purchase history using iTunes on a computer first.
