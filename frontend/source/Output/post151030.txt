Does clean install reset everything, including SMC? <body> strongTL;DR/strong: Does a clean install reset emeverything/em (like SMC, for example)? If not, what else should I do to be sure the computer is completely reset, like it just came from the factory?  My macbook has been acting weirdly for the past few weeks, so I decided to give it clean install with Yosemite.  I think I messed up the SMC and resetting it does not help. I have a Bootcamp partition that I used to play games. My macbook pro would get very hot while gaming on Windows, so I installed Lubbo's Fan Control. That worked for a couple days, until I realized that while booted in OSX the fans were not working at all or working full speed. I tried resetting the SMC, but that didn't help. So I installed iStat Menus, and controlled my fans manually (yeah, a lazy solution). Now I have one fan controlling app on Windows and one on OSX, and neither work as expected (in iStat when I set it to 'default' the fans stop working).  Also, I have been installing a lot of things, and leftover files are all over the place. So, now I'm getting rid of Bootcamp and clean installing Yosemite. How do I go about doing this properly and thoroughly? I'd like to make the computer fresh as it just came out of the factory. Should I do anything besides a clean install?  <answer151032> A fresh OS install won't reset the hardware, SMC or PRAM. It might be well worth checking both those are correctly reset before going so far as a wipe &amp; install.  Reset the PRAM first - hold Cmd/Opt/P/R at the chimes &amp; wait for the chimes to happen a second time.  SMC varies per machine, Mac Pro is sufficient to power off &amp; leave the mains plug out for a minute. MacBooks are different - http://support.apple.com/kb/ht3964 covers all the variations.

I want to clean install anyway. Do I reset SMC and PRAM before reinstalling? <comment177684> I'd reset both & see if it fixes things on its own - just might save you the trouble. If not, then you can always repeat before or after reinstall; it won't hurt anything. Run basic drive tests too - from Recovery or booted to OS. Disk Utility, repair permissions & verify [or repair] the disk.
