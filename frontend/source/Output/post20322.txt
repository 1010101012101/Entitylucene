Can you run Disk Utility from bootable lion disk? <body> I've made a bootable lion disk by extracting the InstallESD.dmg from the lion installer app's package contents. - (ContentsSharedSupportInstallESD.dmg)  When booting from this disk, can you run disk utility or any other utilities from the menu bar (like you could in the SL install)?  Thanks  <answer20325> Yes, you can.  plug in the disk, boot up in it by holding down kbdoption/kbd, select the disk, and and then run disk utility from the main window.  Why do this however, when you have the Restore partition available to do this without a disk?  <comment22524> The reason you might want to do this is if you had a mac with SL and you wanted a clean install of lion in one step :) <comment22525> OK, I can see that then.
