Intermittent ding/sonar sound coming from Macbook Pro... even when turned off! <body> My MacBook Pro late 2014 is making a ping sonar-like noise every 30-35 seconds, strongeven when muted and the laptop is turned off./strong It seems to be coming from the left side of the MacBook and is very loud.   I've made a video so you can hear the sound and how frequently it occurs (first noise at 0:14, then 0:53 and finally 1:31).  <answer186179> There is an alert noise when logic board is failing/has failed.   Have you tried various start-up options?
