Technical comparison: MBP 15" mid-2010 or MBP 13" 2012 <body> I plan to use the MBP to edit a lot of pictures.   I am torn between spending less than $600 on a mid-2010 MBP 15" (Core i7 2.66Ghz) or a 2012 MBP 13" (Core i5 2.5Ghz) for less than $800.   The MBP 15" tech is too old and it doesn't even have a USB 3.0 port but has a fast processor while the MBP 13" screen is too small for editing pictures (but I can attach it to an external monitor, no problem there).   Should I just wait and save up for the MBP 13" or buy the MBP 15" now?  Can someone share they experiences and advice including the Graphics performances?  <answer165006> Let me provide you with my opinion:  ul liThe CPU can not be changed (well it could but at about $1000)/li liThe slower USB is normally not a issue unless you are high user of external disks, etc. (and even then it is unlikely to make a noticeable difference)/li liBuying an external screen will always be an option regardless of model (only budget question)./li liPortability? Do you have to travel a lot?/li /ul  Since your main use is to edit pictures, how about a graphics quality comparison?  hr     h3MacBook Pro (15-inch, Mid 2010)/h3      strongGraphics and video support/strong      ul   liNVIDIA GeForce GT 330M graphics processor with 256MB of GDDR3 memory on 2.4GHz and 2.53GHz configurations; or 512MB of GDDR3 memory on 2.66GHz configuration/li   liIntel HD Graphics with 256MB of DDR3 SDRAM shared with main memory/li   liAutomatic graphics switching/li   liDual display and video mirroring: Simultaneously supports full native resolution on the built-in display and up to 2560 by 1600 pixels on an external display, both at millions of colors/li   /ul   supSource: http://support.apple.com/kb/SP582/sup  The Cons:br The MacBook Pro 15″ Mid 2010 had an 'intermittent black screen or loss of video' problem caused by the graphics card.

Is it going to be able to cope with you continuous higher demand on processing power over that period (CPU). What will you be doing in 3 Years where the Mac should cope with it. <comment193511> You may want to check if this MBP 15 mid 2010 doesn't have the GPU problem like mine does. Some units may crash a lot (GPU panic) even without much "stress". Here's some info: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5759538?tstart=0 There are a many discussions about this on the internet. <comment193513> I'll probably use this for 12-18 months until I can afford to buy another machine with better specs. <comment193514> I didn't use graphics quality in my criteria but you have a good point. Not sure which one renders better. Also, I will be using the MBP mostly at home where I do all my photo work. <comment193515> @grgarside - looks like a shopping question to me
