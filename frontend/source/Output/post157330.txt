SSH with ipv6 working only if I pass %en0 with my ipv6 address <body> I am trying to ssh with Mac OS X (10.10.1 Yosemite) terminal using ipv6. If I use command like   precodessh username@ipv6_address /code/pre  It's not working and I am getting error "No Route to Host". But If I use command like (with %en0)  precodessh username@ipv6_address%en0 /code/pre  It's working and I am able to SSH with ipv6 address..  Can you please guide me what's the reason of not working without %en0?  Thanks.  <answer157356> When you want to connect to an unroutable address like link-local you need to specify the interface. This is because for unroutable addresses your system can't determine the outgoing interface by looking at the routing table.  Unroutable destinations include link-local addresses (fe80::) and link-local multicast (ff02::) and more.  <comment184969> Which IPv6 addresses are you using. Having to specify the interface is only necessary when using link-local addresses (those starting with `fe80:`). Those are not routable and not very convenient to use. You'll want to get routable IPv6 addresses (from an ISP, a tunnel provider or ULA) when using IPv6. <comment184970> @SanderSteffann Yes, It's starting with fe80. Means to connect with local need to specify interface? <comment184993> Yes. I'll put this into an answer <comment185006> Thanks for the reply. For routable ipv6 address, I can get from ISP, correct? or need any changes in network configuration? <comment185056> http://superuser.com/q/99746/144961 <comment185074> From your ISP, or for internal use (not to connect to the internet) you can generate your own ULA addresses.
