External keyboard issues on Sierra? <body> Some people I know have not been able to use function keys on their external keyboards after upgrading to macOS Sierra. I have not upgraded to Sierra because of this. Is anyone else experiencing these issues and is there any known solution?  <comment324279> Without knowing the specifics like which machines (model/years/specs) and the types of external keyboards, it's going to be tough to diagnose. <comment324280> All of the computers are 13 inch MacBook pros (2012 or 2013) and the issue apparently occurs with any keyboard.
