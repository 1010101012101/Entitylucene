How can I see what bandwidth each App or process is using? <body> I see suddenly that my downstream bandwidth is 400 KBps which is the maximum my ISP gives me, so there's an application downloading at its top capacity.br The thing is I didn't start any download, so it's doing it in the background without telling.br How can I know which app or process is using it?br Or, basically, how can I determine how much bandwidth each open process or application is using?  <answer16696> codesudo fs_usage/code might id the process  <answer16753> emlsof/em and emiftop/em (direct Link to install package) are the best tools that come to mind.  Also, take a look at this question.  <answer30459> This help at all? Take a look at the NetMonitor Sidekick add on. Have not tried it myself but will probably load on virtual machine to see how it works.  http://homepage.mac.com/rominar/net.html  <answer38604> Rubbernet is a really great app that allows you to see the per application network usage of your Mac plus it supports Remote Monitoring. You can install a Rubbernet plugin any Mac that you have administrative access and then monitor the per application bandwidth utilization of all the Macintosh on your network from your own computer.  It does cost money (30 Euros on their website but for some reason its $19.99 on the Mac App Store but they have a fully functional Free Trial on their website. I haven't bought the app yet, so I can not confirm that you can buy one license for the app and then install the plugin on any number of Macs for now additional charge. But that seems to be the situation.  The Developers are the same folks who do the Linkinus IRC Client.  <answer38606> Another option that is not quite as good as it does not have any kind of remote monitoring mechnaism and didn't seem to do as good a job is OS Track. Its also available on the Mac App Store for free. I didn't really like this app as it seemed to consume a lot of resources itself. But that might be something they fixed in a later version.  <answer168944>    Quote: "How can I know which app or process is using it?"   You can try nettop(1) in the Terminal. It is pre-installed, and refreshes every few seconds to provide a dashboard of all open network connections (by process) with their usage. Better than codelsof/code since it shows the usage data too.  precode$ nettop /code/pre  Then hit 'd' and look for odd-looking entries or entries with consistently large traffic in the 'bytes in' or 'bytes out' column. The 'd' instructs nettop to only show differences in each screen refresh.  h3Practical usage notes:/h3  If you don't recognize the process name, Google it.  If you don't want the process around, get the pid (the number next to the process name in nettop), and kill it with codekill -9 &lt;pid&gt;/code. If that doesn't solve it, find out if you can uninstall the process.  If you're interested in what the process is transmitting over the network, use the client port number for that particular connection (e.g. '53133' from code10.0.0.1:53133-&gt;74.125.68.100:80/code) to run a tcpdump(1) to see the data in the packets being exchanged: codesudo tcpdump -nnvvXSs 1514 port 53133/code  If you're interested in the destination the process is talking to, but the destination IP address doesn't have a reverse DNS hostname (like in the previous example), then try visiting that IP address in a web browser as https://IP, click the broken lock icon in the address bar, and view the certificate details to find out which domain is served there (*.google.com in this case). This won't work if SSL port 443 isn't open on the destination.  <answer253357> You can easily view all network activity from the Activity Monitor; it's built right in to OS X.  ul liOpen Applications  Utilities  Activity Monitor/li liClick Network tab/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/g36e0.png" alt="Activity Monitor, Network Tab; Sorted by Packets Sent"  <comment18241> I've stumbled across a firewall app before that can graph network usage per app and per user... but I can't seem to find it anymore. :/ <comment18261> HandsOff shows per-app usage <comment18271> was the automatic software update? <comment18301> @jm666: That was my first suspect, but it wasn't <comment18312> But it doesn't show which app is using the bandwidth <comment18341> @Petruza, you can identify the program associated with a particular connection using lsof and then monitor the bandwidth of the connection with iftop. It should be enough information to audit the suspect connections/programs. <comment18342> @Petruza, in your case you would probably start with iftop to identify the connection using up your bandwidth then trace the connection to the owning app with lsof or netstat. <comment198366> I don't understand the reason for the negative vote. AFAICT, the answer is *exactly* what the OP is looking for (how to monitor which process is using up the bandwidth). <comment251798> **Link dead @ Oct 2015** <comment374258> The product seems to be here : http://netmonitor.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/net.html
