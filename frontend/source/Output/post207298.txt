Upgraded to iOS 9.0.1 and lost all health weight data <body> I just upgraded my iPhone (model MG5D2LL/A) to iOS 9.0.1 yesterday, and I did one backup restore to resolve an issue with the Podcast app (still not resolved).  I lost most of my Health app data. I lost all of my manually entered weight data (several years worth) and my Medical ID. For some reason the dashboard is still showing the last 7 days of steps, walking, climbing data.  Is there any way to recover that data?  <answer207317> Backups don't backup health data unless they're encrypted backups.  Thus, if you restore one of these unencrypted backups, you won't restore the health data. This data is goneâ€”it's not stored in iCloud for privacy reasons.  <answer209858> Same happened to me this morning. Switching phone off and back on seems to have done the trick.  <comment249969> Was your backup encrypted? Without an encrypted iTunes backup, passwords & health data are not saved. <comment249973> It wasn't, thanks for the info. So the info was wiped out (replaced by "empty info") during the backup? <comment249974> As far as I know, yes, sorry - I only made that mistake on my first ever iPhone, a long long time ago <comment254492> My backup was encrypted. My data disappeared during 9.0.1 update. Switching phone off and back on also worked for me.
