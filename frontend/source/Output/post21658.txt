How do I make an AppleScript with a drop-down menu without Xcode? <body> How do I make an AppleScript that displays a drop-down menu without using Xcode?  <answer21666> You don't need Xcode for AppleScript. Just open the 'AppleScript Editor' in 'Applications/Utilities' (Finder shortcut for the Utilities folder: âŒ˜+shift+u). There is some sample code for dropdown menus here.  <answer21671> There is no built in concept of a menu in the dialogs-alerts within the AppleScript language.   The closest you could do would be to name some dummy files (in a temporary folder) with the appropriate action and have the user choose the file labeled with the action you wanted to perform.  precodeopen folder blah   with selected file bah     do whatever /code/pre  A horrendous "solution" to a problem that needs a cocoa menu - whether you make it in Xcode or someone else does - strongXcode/IB is the tool that creates a menu/strong. MacRuby is a nice way to script an app that needs a more full featured UI than AppleScript. You don't need Xcode/IB to ruby up an app from pure script.  You could create a NIB using Interface Builder and script it all using AppleScript, but the nib defines the menu itself - not AppleScript (even if AppleScript can populate or delete the menu items at run time).  <answer27309> Additionally, if you just need a list to choose from, you could also do   codechoose from list listYouDefined with prompt "Choose from the list."/code   Google "AppleScript Choose from list".  <answer27346> One option would be to use CocoaDialog:  precodeset l to {"aa", "bb", "cc"} set choices to "" repeat with x in l     set choices to choices &amp; quoted form of x &amp; " " end repeat set dialog to paragraphs of (do shell script "/Applications/CocoaDialog.app/Contents/MacOS/CocoaDialog" &amp; " standard-dropdown --title title --text text --items " &amp; choices) if item 1 of dialog is "2" then return -- pressed cancel button item ((item 2 of dialog) + 1) of l /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Af8g1.png" alt=""  You could also just use codechoose from list/code:  precodechoose from list {"aa", "bb", "cc"} with title "Title" with prompt "Please choose" default items "bb" with multiple selections allowed /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/27NaQ.png" alt=""  <comment23820> I have already looked at that link. The script requires a NIB/Xcode interface. <comment23824> It's a great example of how AppleScript can modify the menu items at run time though :-) <comment23838> Yeah, but not exactly what I'm looking for.
