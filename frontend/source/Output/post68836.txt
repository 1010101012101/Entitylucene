Where can I download Safari for Windows? <body> This sounds like an absurd question, I know, but when I go to:  http://www.apple.com/safari/  There isn't a download link! I'm sure it used to be there :-/  Here's what I see:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3OcFV.png" alt="enter image description here"  Scrolling further just has more features. No link!  <answer68837> Safari strong5/strong is available via Apple's KB. The original page no longer exists, but the EXE is still hosted. According to 9to5mac, it seems that have Apple decided to stop producing Safari for Windows, so Safari 5 is all that's likely to be available moving forward.  <answer69089> There is no link to Safari for Windows because Apple stopped making it. If you want a copy of Safari for Windows you have to download the installer somewhere, or retrieve it from your backup.  strongUpdate:/strong This link still works: SafariSetup.exe  <answer94010> The Windows version was discontinued.  As of 2016-09-29 version 5.34.57.2 is available from Apple here: http://appldnld.apple.com/Safari5/041-5487.20120509.INU8B/SafariSetup.exe  As of 2013-06-14 version 5.1.7 is available from Download.com here: http://download.cnet.com/Apple-Safari/3000-2356_4-10697481.html?tag=mncol;1  <answer191407> Like the others have said, Apple has ceased development for it. The latest Windows version is 5.1.7 and you can find it in several places including FileHippo (http://filehippo.com/download_safari/)    It will give you warnings galore, that its not the latest most secure browser, but if you must run it for some reason - there it is.  <comment79956> Weird! I guess it has something to do with v6 coming out. Thanks! <comment110524> Apple ceased support on May 9, 2012. <comment157283> It is still available to download at the Apple website via: http://support.apple.com/downloads/#safari <comment225583> the kb link is no more valid. http://support.apple.com/downloads/#safari only lists downloads for mac OS versions. <comment253800> Official download links now no longer exist. <comment256280> That really bytes! <comment272171> Good that the webarchive of Apple's KB article is available/cached. Sucks that Apple removed it. <comment285050> BAD IDEA to install this old thing; it's riddled with security holes, and does not support modern web site SSL protection, so more and more sites will not even load at all in it anymore. <comment297597> @cnd The only reason any of us are downloading this stupid is browser is so that we can support our clients. <comment302198> And removed from their website after July 25, 2012: http://web.archive.org/web/20120725034340/http://www.apple.com/safari/ <comment328640> Curiously version 5.34.57.2 says version 5.1.7 in the About Box <comment335296> Where did that 5.34 link come from? I can't find any reference to this download anywhere else. Is there an official download page where I can point clients to who are using the old version? <comment336473> Unbelievable. I agree with the commenter who said above "North Korea of the technology sector" <comment369878> @mpen now that you know it is stupid to have this outdated browser, it is your duty to let your clients know. If you are worried about osX users, they'll be very few to still have an SL. If you really want to support your users, reproduce their environment the best you can (the least being an up-to-date VM).
