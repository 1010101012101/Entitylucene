Cellular Settings no longer Editable in iOS 9.0.1 <body> Upgraded my iPhone 4S to 9.0 and had no issues. upgraded to 9.0.1 and now if I change the settings under cellar so I can use my apps when not near secure wifi, the settings won't stay. Only the cellular settings that were set before i upgraded to 9.0.1 are available and working. what gives?  If I reset all settings - will I have to reenter my at home wifi and the wifi passwords for my family's homes? upgrades are a pain!!  <comment251184> not the same issue - because the remedy for the above was to upgrade to 9.0.1! that's what ruined my cellular settings and now none of the settings stay when i set them <comment251186> The remedy in the linked duplicate was to restore without restoring from backup, or [deleting CellularData.db](https://georgegarside.com/blog/ios/cellular-data-app-preferences-not-saving-on-ios-7/) once it's possible. <comment251200> Check this article out: https://apple.news/AEdnHsTkYM8yLXCnjtXG2vQ I guess that the way I copied the link, it'll only open in Apple News, but you do have an iPhone running iOS 9. <comment253253> @Red apple.news redirects to the article's website. <comment253380> @grgarside Not if opened on an iDevice. <comment253381> @Red I know; I'm saying the link doesn't only open in Apple News.
