How can my son access my iTunes account from his windows 8 'sign on' on my computer? <body> I want my son to be able to access my full iTunes library without signing in to my Microsoft account on my Windows 8 pc.  He has his own Microsoft account/sign in. I have tried Home Sharing, but this seams only to work if he has a different computer (and we only have this one). I do not want to create a separate iTunes account for him.  When he opens iTunes and looks at the songs list, he can see some, but not all of the songs in my library. Can anyone help?  <answer126280> Apple provides an answer to this question.  In short:  ul liQuit strongiTunes/strong/li liGo to strong\Users*username*\Music\iTunes/strong (where strongemusername/em/strong is your /li liMove the strongiTunes Media/strong (might be strongiTunes Music/strong) folder to a public folder, e.g. strong\Users\Public\Public Music/strong/li liNow, on each Windows account: ul liLaunch strongiTunes/strong/li liIn the strongEdit/strong menu, select strongPreferences/strong/li liClick the strongAdvanced/strong icon**/li liClick the strongChange/strong button/li liNavigate to strong\Users\Public\Public Music/strong (or whatever public folder you moved your music to)/li liClick strongOK/strong/li /ul/li /ul  You should be all set. If you’re not, that might be because iTunes for Windows apparently doesn’t automatically move your music to its strongiTunes Media/strong folder. emIn the account which holds the music/em:  ul liLaunch strongiTunes/strong/li liIn the strongFile/strong menu, select strongLibrary  Organize  Consolidate Library/strong. Your music will be emcopied/em into the strongiTunes Media/strong folder. You may want to do a bit of cleanup to avoid data duplication. /li /ul  <comment147894> if you found a question worthy a answer without need for additional questions... give the OP vote up :) <comment147919> @Buscar웃 True. I tend to vote up questions which are of particular interest to me, but voting up well written question does make sense.
