iPad stuck on Guided Access with broken home button <body> My iPad is stuck on Guided Access. I do remember the passcode but my home button is broken. I've been using the on-screen home button but that too is disabled. Will draining the battery out fix my problem or is there another way?  <answer255576> After a quick google search, I found this video that may help you, depending on what version of iOS you have. There are many other tutorials on youtube that you should check out as well.  Good Luck!
