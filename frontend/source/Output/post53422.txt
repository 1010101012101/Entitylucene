Save screenshot with my own name <body> When I save a screenshot I want to be able to specify any name I want (and maybe destination directory). Sharpshooter for mac does this, but it's a ridiculous $15. Cheaper alternatives?  <answer53425> Skitch lets you do this, as well as online sharing, annotation, and drawing, and it's free.  <answer53470> h3Changing the prefix part of the names/h3  precodedefaults write com.apple.screencapture name "My Screenshot" killall SystemUIServer /code/pre  h3Changing the format of the names/h3  precodef=/System/Library/CoreServices/SystemUIServer.app/Contents/Resources/English.lproj/ScreenCapture.strings f2=~/Desktop/ScreenCapture.strings sudo cp $f $f2 sudo chown $USER $f2 plutil -convert xml1 $f2 open $f2 -a TextEdit /code/pre  Change  precode&lt;key&gt;%@ %@ at %@&lt;/key&gt; &lt;string&gt;%@ %@ at %@&lt;/string&gt; /code/pre  To something like  precode&lt;key&gt;%@ %@ at %@&lt;/key&gt; &lt;string&gt;My %@ %@ at %@&lt;/string&gt; /code/pre  (The default format is currently something like codeScreen Shot 2012-06-12 at 8.02.40 AM/code depending on the locale settings.)  precodesudo chown root $f2 sudo cp $f2 $f killall SystemUIServer /code/pre  h3Changing the default location/h3  precodedefaults write com.apple.screencapture location ~/Pictures/ killall SystemUIServer /code/pre  h3Using custom scripts/h3  I've disabled the default shortcuts and have assigned shortcuts to scripts like codescreencapture -i ~/Desktop/`date '+%y%m%d%H%M%S'`.png/code.  <answer53750> LittleSnapper does this and more. It's $40, but worth every penny.  <answer53752> A much easier way than Laurie's answer is to use a free application called Deeper. It is emreally/em easy to use. Just enter in the name of that you want in the screenshot name field (under the General tab):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZX9hv.jpg" alt=""    Click "Apply" and you are done. A nice feature of Deeper is the ability to restore all the default settings. If you've made a change to the settings that is causing your system to act up, no problem! At the bottom of each tab is a button that says "Restore Defaults". Deeper will fix up all your settings. I highly recommend this app, as it is free and adds a great deal of customization that OS X doesn't provide.  <answer250887> You can configure Better Touch Tool to open a window like the following after taking a screenshot:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bA8ty.png" alt="enter image description here"  where you can edit/annotate your screenshot and then save it with whatever name you like, or save it to the cloud.  It's a pay-what-you-want model (minimum $3).  Best purchase I've ever made (for screenshot-ability and for many other reasons).  <comment61554> It's also frequently available as part of Mac software 'bundles' where you can get 10 apps for $50, so keep an eyes out for that. <comment61555> Skitch is the cheapest and easiest solution, by far. If you don't already have it, I highly recommend that you take a look at it. <comment61556> I would never ever ever recommend editing a file in /System/. You can change the prefix of new screen captures via defaults, e.g. `defaults write com.apple.screencapture name "Foo Bar"` and then `killall SystemUIServer` You will still get the date/time information at the end of the filename, but I think that's a feature. You've provided a great answer. It was just that one part that was dubious, IMO. <comment228242> "depending on the locale settings" -- this is useful for people who are looking to get 24-hour time strings into their screenshots so they sort properly on your desktop! Change your date and time settings in system preferences to do this. <comment251589> I tried setting my screen capture location to a remote filesystem which is not always connected. Initially it worked. Then when I disconnected the filesystem it started using the desktop. When I reconnect to the filesystem, I need to do `killall SystemUIServer` again otherwise it keeps using the desktop.
