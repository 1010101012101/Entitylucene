Macintosh HD no longer shown in ‚å•-boot menu after creating partition in Boot Camp <body> Today I was in Boot Camp Windows 7 creating a partition from some free space for Time Machine backups (I know this isn't the best way to store backups, but that's not the problem). I clicked to create a new simple volume and it said it was created as "TIMEMACHINE". Formatted as FAT32. Everything's going fine.  Now, I restart my computer into Mac mode, and I find that the "Macintosh HD" option is completely gone.  When running Internet Recovery, I see the correct partitions are still there for Boot Camp, Mac, etc. as disk0s1 and disk0s2 (they are the correct sizes), but they are not labeled as anything except disk0s1 and disk0s2
