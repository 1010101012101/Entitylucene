Pair with a Bluetooth device over Terminal <body> I am trying to connect and pair a Bluetooth device from the command line. I can do it over the GUI using the standard process but I am looking to automate the whole process.   I am looking for commands that can be executed in a shell script to connect to the Bluetooth device. Just like Linux has "hcitool", "pand" commands, I am trying to find equivalent commands for macOS.  How can I accomplish this?  <answer268374> This seems a little bit "hacky", but you can do this by using an oascript which emulates the GUI-interactions needed for connecting: https://stackoverflow.com/a/23018886/5269642  I couldn't really find any documented API's for bluetooth unfortunately, the oascript-approach was the best I could find/think of so far.
