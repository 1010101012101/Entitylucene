fish shell suggests commands in tmux <body> I use fish shell, it's has option "suggests commands", so it is works like in the next screenshot.   strongExamle:/strong You type command codegit status/code. In the next time when you type just codeg/code or codegit/code fish give you hint (like in the next screenshot), so you can press codectrl+F/code and you are getting full command codegit status/code(like tab arrow in other terminals).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mex8T.png" alt="suggests commands in fish shell"  But when I use tmux, this option strongdoesn't work correct/strong. There are no hint like in first screenshot. For examle: when I type codegit/code, it should be give me hint codegit status/code(like in first screenshot), but there are no any hint, I just see what I type. But when I press codectrl+F/code I get full command codegit status/code  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8SdEq.png" alt="enter image description here"  In ubuntu it's works fine.   <comment192900> What is your question exactly? <comment192937> @Tyson update question, hope it became more understandable. <comment192938> Does it work in Ubuntu if you use `tmux` there? <comment192946> @patrix yes in Ubuntu it works. <comment192948> The key point is whether it works **with tmux** on Ubuntu? <comment192954> The key point is that it works with tmux on Unbuntu but not on OS X.Maybe problem in config, but I don't find any solution for now.
