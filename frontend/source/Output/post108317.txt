Configure OSX Notification Banner self-dismiss time <body> How can I reduce the amount of time before an OSX notification banner dismisses itself?  <answer108365> Currently, you cannot change the duration. But you can dismiss it manually by placing the cursor over the banner and doing a two finger swipe from left to right on a trackpad (or a one finger swipe on a magic mouse).  <answer215083> Open your terminal and run this command  precodedefaults write com.apple.notificationcenterui bannerTime SECONDS /code/pre  where SECONDS is a number for how many seconds you want the banner to be displayed.  <comment127131> Bummer. Maybe I go plist digging if I have some free time later.
