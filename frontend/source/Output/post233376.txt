App Store reports updates but no updates are available <body> It's one day that the AppStore icon and application of my iPhone 5S reports that there is one update to be done, but, in fact, no updates are available. I already tried to switch the iPhone off and on or reopen the app, but nothing changes.  Why does this happened, and how can I fix it?  <answer235714> Why not why can't they update it seems like this is a scam so that apple can get more money what do you think  <comment288308> http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/219156/ios-app-store-will-not-update-apps-unless-the-update-button-is-pressed-many-time perhaps? <comment288311> Welcome to Ask Different!
