Changing New Mail Sound in macOS Sierra <body> As of macOS Sierra, assigning a custom sound file in strongMail/strong no longer appears possible. All I get is “New Messages Sound” in addition to the old options:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nBfSV.png" alt="New Messages Sound"  Is there a way to assign a custom strongMail/strong sound in macOS Sierra, possibly via editing a plist?  The interesting thing is, I’ve logged into the strongGuest/strong account, and even though the same option is selected, the sound that plays when a new mail comes in is the sound I had previously under MY user account. But I can’t seem to find where that sound file is assigned.  <answer257325> Add your custom mail sounds to code~/Library/Sounds/code. Then they’ll show up in the strongMail/strong preference pane.  <comment321287> Awesome. Thanks! Now if only those sounds would show up in **Messages** and **FaceTime** too…
