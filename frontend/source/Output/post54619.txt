Are there any widget to tell whether I'm still connected to the internet? <body> I have an unreliable 3G tethered connection. It breaks when shut window blinds, close a door or when I'm moving around the place.  What I'm really looking for is an icon / indicator whether I'm connected to the internet.  Actually I tried some solutions such as Surplus Meter and iStatNano desktop widget but this is not what I'm looking for.  Ideally I would like to strongping some service every 5 secs/strong to see if I'm still online... Are you aware of any solutions providing that feature?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GLAJH.png" alt="istat nano widget"  <comment62559> Do you have Growl installed? <comment62665> I may have... OK... Will give it a try, see what options are available :) <comment62666> Shouldn't be too difficult to write a short shell script with ping in a loop and write a growl message whenever the reachability of a selected host changes.
