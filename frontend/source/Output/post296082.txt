What prevents using .bashrc to initialize Terminal? <body> A few months ago, I made it easier to run scripts I'd written by creating a .bashrc file.  It worked for a while, but it has not worked in a few weeks.  As the Terminal snippet below shows, the file apparently does not run when Terminal is launched.   I haven't changed anything that should affect this.  Is there a Terminal preference that non-intuitively has this effect?  Does use of 'homebrew' override?  precodeMBP-WWG:~ Admin$ echo $PATH /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin MBP-WWG:~ Admin$ ls -late@ .bashrc -rwxr-xr-x  1 Admin  staff  45 Jul 29 14:35 .bashrc MBP-WWG:~ Admin$ cat !$ cat .bashrc  export PATH=~/bin:$PATH export $path=$PATH  MBP-WWG:~ Admin$ echo $SHELL /bin/bash MBP-WWG:~ Admin$ echo $path  MBP-WWG:~ Admin$  /code/pre  <comment373909> You should be using `.bash_profile`  Also see:  https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/119627/why-are-interactive-shells-on-osx-login-shells-by-default/119675#119675 <comment373910> Well, that detailed discussion tells how to get around the problem, but doesn't explain why it worked for a little while and than quit. <comment373911> Terminal.app  PreferencesProfilesShellStartupRun command could cause bashrc to be read. I suggest you read the bash manual under the heading INVOCATION. BTW, where did you define `$path`? <comment373915> export $path= was an error; should have been export path= <comment373916> The "run comand" was off, and I had never changed it (until now).  The command was blnk but when I checked the box, it was auto-filled with "-bash"  Since the other method already got things working, I turned this off again.  I use MacOS man pages but I don't trust them.  I've already found some copied from other unixes without having Apple's changes edited in. <comment373938> Is there another issue here besides the `export $path=$PATH` error?
