USB devices unrecognized; stuck in connection purgatory <body> I have had a frequent issue with the USB ports on my MBP (Retina 13" Early 2015; OSX 10.11.5). This happens a few times per week, and reappeared today.  I was working with a USB device (Arduino) with no issues. I unplugged it to test something, and then plugged it back in a few seconds later... but my computer refused to recognize it. So I switched to the other USB port, on the other side of my computer. This worked.  But I tried to figure things out, and looked at the USB tab of System Information. emWith my device unplugged, I still saw it listed in the USB device tree!/em Then upon plugging it in, emtwo entries/em appeared in the device tree; both identical. Yet the USB device was unaccessible.  I attempted to plug in a USB flash drive – no luck, on either port. The power LED turns on but there does not appear to be a signal, and it doesn't show up in the device tree.  After some more playing around, I got the other USB port "bricked" with my Arduino. That is, with no USB devices plugged into my computer, two entries for the device appeared in the device tree; identical except for the location ID. Then if I plug the Arduino in, I now see three entries; still, nothing works and my USB ports are all but useless.  Some interesting notes:  ul liMy phone will not charge over either port. Power is being supplied (as confirmed by Arduino and flash drive) but my phone won't take it. Computer-side, it shows up in the device tree but is unrecognized by Photos and iTunes./li liThe SD card slot currently works./li liI see codesystem_profiler[20425]: SPUSBDevice: IOServiceGetMatchingService did not return anything for location 0x14100000/code in Console when I try to plug my Arduino in./li /ul  I mentioned this has happened before; occasionally in different forms:  ul liFlash drives not appearing/li liSD cards not appearing/li liPhone not charging/li liHDMI monitors not being connected or ejected (i.e. I unplug monitor but it remains "connected")/li /ul  strongHowever, a reboot invariably fixes all these issues, every time./strong I'd just prefer to not have to reboot a couple of times per week.  I have spoken with Apple Support, and have tried the following, none of which worked:  ul liReset PRAM/li liReset SMC/li liRestoring the OS (not a full erase/restore)/li liCreating a new user account (probably therefore a hardware issue)/li /ul  The issue with options 1 - 3 is that they all involve rebooting, which already emtemporarily/em fixed the issue... so I can't be sure what helps.  This answer only gave errors complaining about being unable to terminate USB kernel services.  The Genius Bar offered to send it off for repairs (possibly replacing an IO board), but might there be any software fixes I can use in the meantime without necessitating a reboot?  <comment303456> After restarting, all issues were resolved until this afternoon, when again I lost USB on one side. I'm not testing the other side because I don't want to be restarting my computer every single day.
