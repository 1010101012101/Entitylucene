How to lock screen of host machine with TDM on Sierra <body> I regularly use my iMac as an external display for my macbook using target display mode (TDM).  Since upgrading my iMac to Sierra, the screen locking behavior has changed in a disturbing way.  I'm hoping there's a configuration flag I can set to revert to the old behavior.  Here's the situation:  ol liI unlock the iMac.  (log in to my account)/li liConnect the two macs with thunderbolt./li liHit command-f2 to enable TDM.  iMac is now an external monitor for macbook./li liUse the macbook for a while.  Lock the screen, walk away.  Wait a long time./li liUnplug the thunderbolt cable./li liThe iMac is logged in and unlocked. (!!)/li /ol  Previously (before Sierra) on step 6, the iMac would have its account locked, which is of course what I want my mac to do if I haven't been using it in a long time.    How can I get my iMac to lock its account when it's being used as an external monitor in TDM mode?  Right now, it seems using TDM is a major security hole for the iMac.  <answer262105> This should not happen at all if your iMac locks itself after a period of time without TDM.  To lock your iMac's account after a period of time, follow these steps:  ol liChoose Apple menu  System Preferences, click Security &amp; Privacy, then click General./li liClick the lock icon  to unlock it, then enter an administrator name and password./li liClick Advanced./li liSelect “Log out after... minutes of inactivity.”/li liSet the amount of time before the user is automatically logged out./li /ol  (quoted from https://support.apple.com/kb/PH18670?locale=en_US)  .  It definitively emis/em supported to log out a user while using Target Display Mode (TDM):     Any apps that are open on your iMac remain open and active while your iMac is in Target Display Mode. (...)      If you've set your iMac to automatically log out, apps are paused or closed when this happens but your strongiMac remains in Target Display Mode/strong.   From: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204592#options  .  Also check these options in System Preferences:  ul liEnergy Saver  Wake for network access (uncheck)/li liSecurity &amp; Privacy  General  Require password emimmediately/em after sleep or screen saver begins (check)/li liDesktop &amp; Screen Saver  Screen Saver  Start after: em1 Minute/em/li /ul  Please let me know if this solves the issue.  <comment328266> Did you perhaps turn off the screensaver on your iMac or have set a very high log off time - as far as i can remember activating TDM never put my iMac into sleep mode it just normally takes so long till i switched back that the normal log off from screensaver already started <comment328835> Good guess, but no.  The account goes to screen saver after a couple minutes of inactivity, and screen saver locks the account very quickly.  At least all this works when not using TDM. <comment328838> Okay, this worked, but I still think there's a Sierra bug here.  Before (when I was seeing this behavior), my settings were for screen saver after 2 minutes, password after 5 seconds, and wake for network access.  When I changed to 1 minute, immediate and no-wake-for-net it started logging out properly.  Thanks! <comment328846> @Leopd thanks for your reply. The .plist file (where the settings are stored) may have become corrupt. Often it helps to change a setting (+ a reboot) and to change it back to the original value. Let me know if this works for you.
