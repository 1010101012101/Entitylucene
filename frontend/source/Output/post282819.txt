Videos look blurry on Macbook pro 13 2015 <body> So I just got my brand new 2015 13' macbook pro, after a long thought if I should get the new 2016 model.  So I'm used to the 2015 15' from work, and now when I watch videos on youtube, or even browsing facebook, everything looks a bit blurry.. I'm using the default resolution that apple recommend but something is missing. The retina display looks way better on my 15' MBP.. is there anything that I missed?   <comment356430> if you're streaming, it could be you're being served a different resolution. Did you check? If the text on FB is crisp, it's not the monitor. <comment356432> what do you mean by "being served?", Yes you right the text is crisp, but the videos aren't and the chat thumbnails are blurred.. <comment356433> served == 'streamed' by YouTube etc - they change your picture quality based on [a guess at] your current connection capacity
