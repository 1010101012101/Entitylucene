Run Terminal Command from .terminal file <body> I just figured out how to export settings from terminal which creates a code.terminal/code file. And I realize that the codeExecutionString/code parameter has changed to the codeCommandString/code parameter.  I put a command in the string tags and it worked but it jumped straight to code[Process Completed]/code after it was done. Is there anyway to get it to give me a new prompt line for more commands?  <answer210621> In the .terminal file, codeRunCommandAsShell/code should not be set to code&lt;true/&gt;/code.  This correlates to the "Run inside shell" checkbox in the "Shell" section of the preference window; which is more intuitively named.  When the preference is not selected (codeRunCommandAsShell/code is true), then the default shell is replaced with whatever command you've used.  If the preference is selected (codeRunCommandAsShell/code is either false or not listed in the .terminal file), then the command is run after the default shell is loaded for that Terminal window/tab.  <comment253440> Can't you start a new terminal window to enter commands? <comment253449> In the .terminal file, is the "RunCommandAsShell" value set to "true/" ? <comment253555> @Kent that was it! I don't understand exactly what that does. Could you explain? <comment254199> I moved the expanded explanation in to the Answer section. <comment254201> thank you, this may seem like a silly question, but how can the command replace the default shell if `RunCommandAsShell` is true? Doesn't a command need a shell to run in? <comment254208> It's a pretty good question.  As far as I understand it, a command doesn't need a shell but just a parent process.  There are API hooks in OSX to allow a program to execute a unix command directly, and this is probably what Terminal is doing.  Sorry if that doesn't completely answer your question, but if you want more information, I think that would be a good question to ask either here (for an apple-specific answer), or at Super User (for more general unix info).
