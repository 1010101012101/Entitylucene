What privacy setting must be enabled to use Night Shift's Sunset to Sunrise option? <body> I'm trying to enable the Sunset to Sunrise option for Nightshift. When I do so, a pop-up informs me that it "requires location for time zone to be enabled," and offers a button to send me to the appropriate privacy settings page. Here's a screenshot of the pop-up.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kEzCY.png" alt="Night Shift error"  But the privacy settings appears to have no option corresponding to what's referenced in the pop-up. Here's two screenshots showing my privacy settings:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/W2UcY.png" alt="privacy settings 1" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KDKmJ.png" alt="privacy settings 2"  As far as I can tell, all privacy settings are enabled, but Night Shift still refuses to enable sunset to sunrise. Does anyone know how I can enable it?  <answer290568> h2Reboot./h2  Sometimes, settings don't come into effect until you reboot your device, especially if it's a system-wide preference. Rebooting tends to solve most System Preferences-related issues.   Sometimes, System Preferences won't tell you to reboot your device, but if something isn't working, rebooting should solve your issue.   strongNight Shift location services do not take effect until your computer is rebooted./strong  <comment366778> Have you rebooted since you checked the time zone setting box? <comment366781> That was it. I didn't think to reboot and I don't remember anything prompting me to, but it may have.
