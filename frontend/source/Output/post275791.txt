How to stop Google Photos from launching at system startup? <body> Google Photos starts every time I turn on my Macbook Pro. It is annoying and I believe it slows down the OS' startup speed. Is there a way to turn the launch at startup option off? I do not see it in Google Photos' preferences. It seems the only option is to uninstall it:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yRHcQ.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer275797> If it's listed in System Prefs  Users &amp; Groups  [yourname]  Login Items,br select &amp; hit the minus sign kbd - /kbd  underneath.  <comment346989> is it listed in System Prefs  Users & Groups  [yourname]  Login Items? If so, select & hit the minus sign - underneath. <comment346997> Sorry @DylanChensky, i dind't see this comment, i'll delete my answer. Sorry for the inconvenience.
