Right speakers malfunction on MacBook Pro Retina <body> My laptop has this crackling sound on the right speakers no matter the volume. The noise is not heard with a headset. I noticed this after updating my software to the latest one.  <answer191511> To isolate whether this is truly a hardware or software problem..  ul liLaunch /Applications/Utilities/Audio MIDI Setup.app  /li liIf it doesn't already show, select Audio Devices from the window menu/li liSelect your Speaker output on the left Sidebar; the tab on the right should show Output highlighted &amp; Input greyed out/li liBottom right, select Configure Speakers…/li liIn the new dialog that drops down you should see 'front left' &amp; 'front right' each with a drop menu beneath.  The channels are likely just labelled 1 &amp; 2.    ul liSwap the channels - set left to 2 &amp; right to 1.  /li liTest with some audio playback./li /ul/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/64mq5.png" alt="enter image description here"  If the right speaker still crackles - it's a hardware problem.  If the left speaker is now the one affected - it's a software problem.  Add a comment if it's software &amp; we can test further.br If it's hardware, it's a trip to the Apple shop, I'm afraid.  <answer191516> Because you said it dosen't present on a headset I would check the speakers out prior to doing any sort of complex testing.    Plug your speakers into another source like an iPod/iPad, another Mac/PC or anything you can find with audio out.  If the symptoms still present, then the problem is your speakers.    <comment227459> Not a rational testing method. Proof of a lack of something is not proof of the presence of something else. <comment227551> Your logic is sound, but incorrectly applied.  First, you are postulating a lack of outcome when I specified a positive presence of one.  Were you reading *my* post?  Additionally, given that he stated "the noise is not heard through a headset" the next logical course of action would be to test the speakers, not continue to test the system which was just proven functional.  Unless, of course, you are charging him by the hour.... <comment227588> It's a laptop - "plugging the speakers into another source" would involve removing them from the macbook first. Pretty sure my test would be the cheapest - were I charging by the hour ;) <comment227643> You are assuming he doesn't have a phone with an audio jack, then.  You are also going to send him to the Apple store before you rule out the speakers... I see. <comment227646> You're somehow assuming that any sound from another source will bypass all the electronics in the laptop. Either that or you are assuming the OP means external speakers. There is no simpler way to test for hardware or software before going any further than simply reassigning the outputs, left for right. <comment227648> I thought it was external.  My external speaker suggestion wouldn't apply.  However, there is no software malfunction that would create "crackle" on one set of speakers and not another.   Even though they are internal to the MBP, they are still "external" to the system <comment227649> … hence my quick test of swapping channels… 10 seconds flat to eliminate or confirm one possibility - that it is, as we expect, hardware. <comment228298> The answer that I can see right now (http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/191516/33075) seems to be assuming you're talking about external speakers.  I wonder if that's the case?  My reading of your question (as it appears rifght now) looks like it could be talking about the built-in speakers.  Can you clarify? <comment304499> I have the same problem! I think it might have been a hardware issue. Like it got magnetized or something. <comment304500> Wow it is a hardware problem. Damn. I guess it got magnetized somehow!!!
