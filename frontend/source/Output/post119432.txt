Keyboard switches layout to a disabled input method when playing a game <body> My standard keyboard layout is Italian, QWERTY, which is this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cByk3.png" alt="enter image description here"  You can see it in detail on the Apple site too.  However when trying to play Urban Terror, a free fps online game, my keyboard layout changes. This only happens in game. My keyboard becomes a QZERTY, inverting Z and W and also changing all of the numeric keys. Instead of the regular, numbers from 1-9, I have this (can't find it on the Apple site):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rAzTZ.png" alt="QZERTY image"  As you can see, it's almost completely different. The problem is that my binds in game do not work, because the mapping differs since it's another layout. I could use those keys and "solve" the problem, but it still gives me some troubles sometimes and I'd like to solve the issue completely, than using a workaround. I think (not sure) that the game is actively changing my layout, but can I do something from my side? For your information, this second layout is called "Italiano - m. da scrivere", where m stands for "macchina", and the whole expression means "Italian - Typewriter".  I can't remove this layout completely from my Mac using standard means, so I'd prefer less invasive solutions.  The layout is not being loaded so I don't know why it manages to select that one when it's clearly disabled:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/imBEw.png" alt="Input source choices"
