No Macintosh HD <body> I was attempting to use an Internet dongle but it wasn't working so I followed some steps online to try and get it to work. I reinstalled El Capitan on to my MacBook but when I returned to recovery mode my Macintosh HD had disappeared. I fear I may have accidentally formatted it in the process and there were no backups in time machine. Now my Mac only turns on in recovery mode and when I try to reinstall the software - I've given up hope on restoring my files - the only drive that is there is a base OS X drive which means there is nowhere to install my software. I'm currently on holiday so can't even take it in the Apple Store so any help would be really appreciated!   <answer243204> I'll assume you want a step by step guide to erase and install El Capitan.  If so, that is here:  ul lihttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204904/li /ul  strongStep 6/strong of the erase section is where you would name strongMacintosh HD/strong as the volume name.  <comment299388> When you go into recovery mode, can you go into Disk Utility and take a screen shot of what you are seeing? <comment299389> Has there been an unexpected shutdown or a power failure during the reinstall process? What were the steps you followed and what do you mean by saying "_...but when I returned to recovery mode my Macintosh HD had disappeared._"? After reinstalling OS X you should see the desktop just like regular startup, were you in recovery mode when you tried booting up? <comment299393> *"I followed some steps online.... I reinstalled El Capitan..."* How does one logically follow from the other anyway? It's redolent of buying a new car 'cos the ash-tray's full <comment302289> In disk utility, does your drive show up at all? Not Macintosh HD, but the physical drive itself
