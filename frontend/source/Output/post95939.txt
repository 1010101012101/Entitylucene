Format disk with one Windows and one Mac partition <body> Can I partition an internal hard disk (in a Mac Pro or Mac Mini) such that it contains one partition usable for Mac OS and one usable for Windows?  I know Boot Camp does that for the boot disk but I wonder if it will work for a second disk as well?  Basically I want the system to start either Windows or Mac and use the second disk for data.  <answer95946> If you have 2 hard drives you can do this way:br 1) On 1st drive install osx. Then use bootcamp assistant to re-partition the disk 1 and install windows on second partition. At this point you can via disk utility format the second drive as you wish (e.g.: second drive 1Tb= 500gb fat/ntfs for win data and 500gb hfs+ for osx data);br 2) On 1st drive install osx. Then use bootcamp assistant and select secondary hd (not the osx' one) and install windows. Now you have dual boot on 2 separate disk, 1 fully dedicated to osx and one to windows.   <comment112615> Method 1 is what I was looking for. Have you tried this out or do you just assume that it will work? <comment112645> I've got this setup up and running atm onto my laptop (replaced optical drive with second hd).
