Disable Photos auto-import when connecting memory card <body> I use Lightroom and external CF card reader on a MacBook with 10.11.6. Every time I connect a memory card the Photos import dialog pops up, which is quite annoying since its starts reading from the memory card and often locks up.   How do I disable it globally?  <answer249676> You can disable the auto pop box in iPhotos , In the preference you can turn it off the auto import option. Link  <answer249678> The common answer to this question is to uncheck the auto-launch box in Photos. The problem is that every time you format your memory card in-camera, Photos sees it as a new device and you have to start over.  The only way I have found to disable the auto-launch of any program when inserting a memory card is by going to Terminal and following the instructions here:  Stop Photos Auto-Launch  <comment309789> Unfortunately this sets the flag per volume (CF card) - not for the card reader itself. But its still a working solution unless you have deal with tons of cards. <comment309793> Unfortunately, this answer is incorrect.  The global solution is for iPhoto, not Photos. There is no equivalent global setting in Photos. <comment309876> Ideally, add a summary of the steps described on the link, because links tend to rot. <comment309886> Ideally, someone with greater knowledge of Terminal commands could explain it. I don't feel qualified to summarize and explain those instructions that alter the guts of the OS, other than to say I tried it myself and it works.
