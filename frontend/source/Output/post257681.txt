How do I import my fitness data from Android and keep it in sync in the future? <body> I have used Google Fit on my Android phone for a while, and recently switched to the iPhone. How do I import my step counts and other fitness data into Apple Health on the iPhone from Google Fit?  Are there cross-platform cloud services that store this data in the cloud and have both iOS and Android clients so that I don't have this problem again the next time I switch phones?  I posted the same question on android.stackexchange.com to get answers from Android users.
