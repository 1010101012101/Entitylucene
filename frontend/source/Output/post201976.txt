Can't delete photo, right clicking doesn't bring up trash can <body> I'm trying to delete a photo but it won't bring up any trash icons I've read about when right clicked.br I tried dragging it to trash on the Dock and there are now multiple copies of the photo in the trash but it is still in my photos.  <answer201989> The shortcut to delete files in Finder is usually kbdCmd/kbd+kbdDel/kbd.  And in other apps it is usually just kbdDel/kbd.  <answer202038> Dragging a picture out of Photos will generate a copy of that picture wherever you drag it - including in the Trash.  To completely delete a picture from photos, select it in the All Photos view (not in any Album or Event), then kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd Backspace ← /kbd or right click &amp; Delete (1) Photo  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ReTt7.png" alt="enter image description here"  This will move it to Recently Deleted.    To purge it from there, Edit menu Show Recently Deleted, select it &amp; Delete, or Delete All.  <comment243570> Where are you trying to delete the image from?
