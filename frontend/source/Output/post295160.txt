RSS readers and malware <body> I recently had an issue where some RSS feeds were causing my IT department to think my MBP was infected by ransomware and was connecting to a ransomware server.  Ransomware/malware can be 'caught' just by visiting a compromised website so one would like to think RSS readers, mine is Vienna, block the execution of all code in the pages they load. Is that so? My discussion on Vienna's GitHub page was far less than satisfactory on the matter.  So two things.  The first is to bring this issue to people -- I had no idea my RSS reader could be a potential source of exposure to malware.  RSS readers offer convenience, but apparently I need now to balance that convenience with the potential risks associated with malware.  I believe not many people are thinking of this issue and they might benefit from being aware of it.  Two, is there a way of sandboxing a RSS reader (ideally in the most complete way), so that it cannot be a source of malware?  is disabling JavaScript and plugins in the RSS browser enough (not really clear what plugins the internal browser has to start with...)?
