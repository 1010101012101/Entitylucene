For a bash script I want to replace a folder without changing owner and permissions <body> I want to replace a folder with codecp -f/code without changing owner and permissions  precodecp -R -f "newfolder" "oldfolder" /code/pre  Because I create backups of the old folder with the bash script I tried to use codechmod --reference=/code and codechmod --reference=/code but it looks like this isn't availabe on OS X. Is there any other way to achieve this on OS X?  <comment154998> Have You tried `-p` option in `cp`? <comment154999> I don't want to preserve anything from the source folder but from the target folder. I use `cp -p` for the backups. <comment155003> Can you elaborate on why you want the target folder's permissions? <comment155005> Would using `rsync` without `-p` be an option? <comment155039> @patrix not quite
