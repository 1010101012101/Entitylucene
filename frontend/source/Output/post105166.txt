Find My iPad setting prevents restore <body> I'm trying to restore my iPad because the screen passcode was changed and cannot be remembered correctly. When attempting to restore from an iTunes backup, an error message says to first turn off strongFind My iPad/strong in iCloud settings. I cannot access any setting in the iPad because of the screen lock passcode. Is there another way to do a reset or full factory reset while screen-locked?  <answer105192> You can turn off strongFind my iPhone/strong by logging in to icloud.com from your computer if your iPad is offline (not connected to the Internet).  If it's online, first turn off the iPad completely (press and hold the power button until the strongslide to power off/strong prompt appears, then tap and slide on the prompt to power it off).  To turn off strongFind my iPhone/strong on your iPad, follow these steps on the Apple support page iCloud: Remove your device:     h2Remove your device from Find My iPhone/h2      ol   liSign in to icloud.com/#find with your Apple ID (the one you use with iCloud).br   If you’re already using an iCloud web app, click the app’s name to switch apps./li   liClick All Devices, select the offline device, then click Delete img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/W2MjJ.png" alt="enter image description here"./li   /ol      The Delete icon appears only after Find My iPhone has tried and failed to connect to your device (this may take a few minutes).        Note:   You can also click “Remove from Find My iPhone” in the device’s Info window.      ol start="3"   liClick Remove./li   /ol   <answer116061> I had the same problem; none of the suggested fixes worked.  I used voice commands to disable "voice over". This allowed the unit to unlock.  <answer116732> Try setting the iPad in recovery mode:  ol liconnect the iPad to your computer/li liturn it completely off/li lipress the power button (top button) for three (3) seconds/li liwithout letting go of the power button, press the Home button/li likeep them pressed for ten (10) seconds/li liafter the ten seconds, let go of the power button emwithout letting go of the Home button/em/li likeep pressing the Home button until a message pops in iTunes saying     iTunes has detected a device in recovery mode, you must restore it before you can use it. /li lirestore the iPad/li /ol  Try doing this a few times if you dont succeed the first time.  <comment123722> I followed these steps to remove device from (Find My iPhone) after loging into iCloud. iCloud now reports 'No Devices'. The iPad still will not do a reset in iTunes. The same error displays "Find My iPad must be turned off... go to iCloud settings on your iPad..." Is there some other way to do a reset on this thing? <comment135821> Could you elaborate on how to set up or use voice commands? <comment208420> I get same result as @stepjo, removing ipad in icloud settings from icloud website does not make the message go away. Also tried full power off cycle. <comment208423> This is what worked for me, though I had to try a couple of times -- both the press-and-hold for booting into recover mode, and doing factory restore in itunes. The first attempt failed with "unknown error 4005" from itunes.
