iOS undo text field clear (x) <body> Seemingly fairly regularly, I find myself clicking on the X in a circle to the right of a text field in an iOS app on my iPad, instead of just placing the cursor next to the final character in the text field. Extremely annoying.  Is there a global undo operation that I just can't find through google, or at least one for the factory provided "Clock" app, which I seem to have the most of this type of problem with?  <answer112452> The global undo guesture is to shake the device.   <comment132132> Wonderbar. Thanks!
