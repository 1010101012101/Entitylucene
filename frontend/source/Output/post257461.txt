OS X drives working attached externally but not as internal ones <body> My OS X went corrupt badly on my SSD(A)(internal), I had to wipe it completely.   I downloaded and installed OS Sierra onto a USB flash drive(B) using another OS X Lion HDD(C)(externally). When I try to install a new OS onto my SSD using USB flash drive and try to reboot holding the option key, it does not work if the SSD is mounted internally.   But if I connect the SSD mounted in an external USB case, it worked well. It installed Sierra and runs properly. Not only that if I use the Lion OS X Drive (C) internally, it does not work either, in any case if I connect any drive internally, whole computer fails. In fact it does not boot from an already connected USB flash drive too.   All in all, I can use drives externally but not internally. What can be possible reason? Is the hard drive SATA cable broken? How can I diagnose it?   <comment321466> Possible duplicate of [osx internet recovery older version problem](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/257231/osx-internet-recovery-older-version-problem) <comment321467> This is a duplicate post of the same question.  Voting to close. <comment321470> @klanomath - I guess I see some potential x-over but I retracted the vote... <comment321472> I am just wondering here how to determine if cable is broken or other hardware which preventing using a drive to fail internally. <comment321475> @AmitBravo I had several broken SATA cables. In all cases it was possible to read data - but no way to write data. Since data also has to be written while booting, OS X doesn't start. Such cables may be broken completely of course. Then neither r/o nor r/w is possible.
