How do I open a filtered port in pf? <body> I have opened a number of ports, and am familiar enough with pfctl, but even though I have opened various ports, then show up as "filtered" - which means of course that they are not open.  How can I Open them, or is it a function of having a suitable app using them? For example  precodepass in proto tcp from any to any port 53 /code/pre  In a scan this shows up as ...     53 dns Filtered   How can I open this port?  <answer211185> Usually port scanners use UDP and TCP to scan port. Since most implementations of DNS servers use UDP you probably also have to open 53/udp:  precodepass in proto udp from any to any port 53 /code/pre  <comment255155> PORT   STATE         SERVICE 53/udp open|filtered domain 53/tcp Filtered <comment255156> the command above in pf.conf just opens the UDP port, doesn't change the "filtered" flag for tcp
