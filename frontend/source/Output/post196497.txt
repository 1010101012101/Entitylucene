Why can't I see my photos in finder? <body> When I search for photos in finder I can see just Photo Booth's photos:    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Fa10Z.png" alt="enter image description here"  But I have a lof of pictures in Photos app, why can't I see them?  strongUpdate/strong  The option "use as system photo library" (in Italian: "usa come libreria foto di sistema") is disabled.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UuJbt.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer196500> It seems like you might need to open the Photos app, and within Preferences choose "Use as System Photo Library"...

Other applications such as Preview are able to use Photos as system library (the option is disabled because it is already selected).  <comment234723> The option is disabled (see the edit). <comment234724> The latter would be my suggestion then. I don't know what the issue is sorry. <comment234732> Answer found: I was trying to import a photo from Powerpoint, but it's the application that doesn't support it.
