Google Chrome could not connect to localhost <body> I am using OS X Mountain Lion 10.8.4.  I tried the steps in Installing Apache, PHP, and MySQL on Mac OS X to setup my dev environment, but I am not able to open the virtualhost I created – or codelocalhost/code for that matter.  cURL gives me this error:     curl: (7) couldn't connect to host   For those who are interested, here's my codehttpd-vhosts.conf/code file,  precode&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;     DocumentRoot "/Library/WebServer/Documents" &lt;/VirtualHost&gt;  &lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;     DocumentRoot "/Users/AnkurKaushal/Documents/workspace/dev"     ServerName ankur.local     ErrorLog "/private/var/log/apache2/ankur.local-error_log"     CustomLog "/private/var/log/apache2/ankur.local-access_log" common      &lt;Directory "/Users/AnkurKaushal/Documents/workspace/dev"&gt;         Options Indexes FollowSymLinks         AllowOverride All         Order allow, deny         Allow from all     &lt;/Directory&gt; &lt;/VirtualHost&gt; /code/pre  and my code/etc/hosts/code file:  precode127.0.0.1       localhost 255.255.255.255 broadcasthost ::1             localhost fe80::1%lo0     localhost 127.0.0.1       ankur.local /code/pre  What might I be missing here?  <answer97396> Just do codesudo apachectl -t/code, that will help you fixing any issue your having with Apache configuration.   In that case, it was just a simple space in codehttpd-vhosts.conf/code file that was causing the issue.  <comment113657> Okay I fixed my own question, those who are having any issues like this. Just do sudo apachectl -t, that will help you fixing any issue your having with Apache configuration.  In my case, it was just a simple space in httpd-vhosts.conf file that was causing the issue. <comment113679> Great job, to help us managing this place please make it in a answer so it can be marked as completed.
