Limiting TCP connections <body> How can I limit TCP connections on Mac using Terminal?  I used iptables on Linux (eOS) to limit the connections of an application (Ace Stream Player) as follows:  precode$iptables -A OUTPUT -m limit --limit 50/s -j ACCEPT $iptables -A OUTPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT $iptables -A OUTPUT -j ACCEPT /code/pre  Then I started the application and typed:  precode$iptables -R OUTPUT 3 -p tcp -j DROP /code/pre  If there is a similar program on Mac, how would these lines look like?
