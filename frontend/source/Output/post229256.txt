Which "Go To Top/Bottom" shortcut to use: Fn-Left/Right vs. Command-Up/Down? <body> Are there universal "go to the top" / "go to the bottom" keyboard shortcuts that will work for all apps when using Mac keyboards that lack Home/End buttons (e.g. MacBook Pro)?   The Mac Keyboards Shortcuts page on the Apple support site says:     ul   listrongFn–Left Arrow/strong Home: Scroll to the beginning of a document./li   listrongFn–Right Arrow/strong  End: Scroll to the end of a document./li   listrongCommand–Up Arrow/strong    Move the insertion point to the beginning of the document./li   listrongCommand–Down Arrow/strong  Move the insertion point to the end of the document./li   /ul   Does that mean you need to use different go-to-to/go-to-bottom shortcuts for UI that has insertion points (e.g. document editing) vs. apps that don't (list of emails, web browser, PDF reader, etc.) ?    Another way to this question: is one of these pairs of shortcuts equivalent to Ctrl+Home/Ctrl+End on Windows which always scrolls to the top strongand/strong moves the insertion point to the top or end, regardless of whether it's a document-editing app or not?
