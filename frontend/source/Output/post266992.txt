Different speed for Magic Mouse and built-in trackpad <body> Is there any way to set different tracking speed for Magic Mouse and for built-in trackpad?  I'm using both, but Magic Mouse acts good for me at max tracking speed, but trackpad good for me at average tracking speed.   I see that tracking speeds are adjusted separately for each input device, but actually they affect both mouse and trackpad.   Is there any chance to set different configurations?
