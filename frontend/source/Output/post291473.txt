macOS change chrome default geolocation? <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VP8fo.png" alt="enter image description here"  By mistake, Chrome set my default location and search domain to Romania. How to change it back on macOS. I know this is possible because I have done it before. I just forgot to properly record how I did it so I know how to again...  <comment367982> Is this a problem on Google Search Enigne or on Google Chrome? <comment367986> @gioalexiou Chrome
