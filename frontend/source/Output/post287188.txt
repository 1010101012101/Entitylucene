ipad gets message "infected with virues" must install app j91.gdn. Ipad locks up <body> When in Facebook, get message, system infected with virus. Must load app j91.gdn or elae. Ipad locks at that point. Must kill power and restart to use ipad.  Virues?  <comment362513> I really doubt it but seems like an adware that want you install some apps. What actions did you take? <comment362533> Just to second esQmo_'s comment. It is very unlikely that your iPad has a virus. The message is most likely intended to trick you into installing something malicious or handing over credit card details.
