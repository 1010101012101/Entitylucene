App icon duplicated, with a 'grayish' overlay.. iPhone6 - ios8 <body> So, I've got this iPhone6 since a week now. Today my WhatsApp duplicated itself with a 'grayish' overlay on it. I can move it around, but when tapping it nothing happens.  How does this happen and how can i get rid of this? I guess it might have happened after an update, second time this happened. First time it happened a different app duplicated itself just like this.  I've been searching the internet, but could not find any explanation/solution. Hope you guys can help me out!  Thanks in advance!  Down here i made a screenshot of it.  a busy cat http://i58.tinypic.com/m93d00.png  <answer175374> This happens sometimes when an app installation or update fails and SpringBoard still shows the icon from cache.  To fix it, try any of the following:  ul liSometimes, holding down on any icon to start edit mode, then tapping the strong×/strong to delete the placeholder will work fine./li liReboot—this clears SpringBoard cache./li liIf your device is jailbroken, run codeuicache/code as mobile, then respring./li /ul  <comment206751> The '×' does not appear on this specific clone, i will edit the post while i make a reboot as you suggested. :) <comment206752> Reboot worked fine, hopefully this bug will stop repeating itself and Apple will fix this issue soon. Thanks for helping! <comment242701> Same thing happenend to me on my brand new iPhone 6. Reboot fixed the issue thanks for the tip <comment367247> I had the same thing but the name under it kept changing. It said twitter when I saw it, then switched to target and then podcast. It did not have the x to delete and disappeared when I rebooted. It looks unlike any app I have
