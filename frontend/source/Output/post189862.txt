Parallels desktop keeps creating windows/ubuntu folders in launchpad <body> When i remove Windows/Ubuntu folder from ~/Applications i am not seeing them in the launchpad.  But whenever i launch parallels desktop - it automatically creates Windows/Ubuntu folders:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VcXs0.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  How to prevent parallels from creating these folders again?  EDIT. My question is not about how to delete these folders - question is about how to stop parallels from creating these folders again and again after i launch parallels.  <answer189877> Turn the first one off and they won't show up in Launchpad:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SfEdl.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment225303> possible duplicate of [How to remove shortcuts from Launchpad installed by Windows through Parallels 10?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/189778/how-to-remove-shortcuts-from-launchpad-installed-by-windows-through-parallels-10)
