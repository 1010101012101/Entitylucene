Application runs, but I can't find the .app file (Pages, Numbers) <body> If I open up a .pages or .numbers file on my computer (macOS 10.12.4), the respective applications open without delay.  However, when I search for Pages.app or Numbers.app in Finder, I cannot find either application! Neither application is listed in the Applications directory.  Where are these apps located?  <answer277849> You can check where any application is located via the Dock.  Right-click on the app's icon in the Dock and go to Options  Show in FInder.  If you haven't already got Pages and Numbers in your Dock, you don't need to add them. You can still do the above while they're running.  <comment349677> Ah... thanks, now I feel silly. Both files were in a directory below `Volumes`, and were invisible to search. How strange... <comment349682> In which directory were they found? They should begin /Volumes/Macintosh HD/Applications or perhaps /Volumes/Macintosh HD/user_account/Applications. <comment349909> @IconDaemon They were in a folder directly below /Volumes that had the same name as one of my external hard drives, which had long been unmounted. I don't know why or how they ended up there. <comment349965> And have you have moved them back to the /Applications folder where they belong? That's the sensible location.
