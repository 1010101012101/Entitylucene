Cut files in ForkLift 2 <body> I decided to give ForkLift 2 a try, since it is currently on sale in MAS. I've been using XtraFinder to enable normal (Cmd+X) file cut operation in Finder.   Now that I'm trying to move to ForkLift I can't find a way to make this command work.br No shortcut in the preferences can be set for the operation. Is there a workaround?   <answer202050> Finder doesn't have a cut kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd X /kbd  behaviour for files, only for file names.   It uses Edit menu  Copybr or kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd C /kbd    then Edit menu holding kbd Alt ⌥ /kbd  Move Item Herebr or kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd Alt ⌥ /kbd kbd V /kbd instead.  ... or Drag holding kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd between volumes  <answer202052> From the Forklift manual...     Copy      To copy the item(s) selected in the active pane to the folder opened in the opposite pane you can use the following methods:      ul   liclick the toolbar icon/li   liselect File  Copy to from the menu/li   liuse the cmd-c keyboard command to copy the item(s) to the clipboard, then switch to the second pane with TAB and use cmd-v to paste/li   licopy is also available in the item list context menu/li   lithe commander style keybinding set allows the use of F5 for 'copy to'./li   /ul   <comment243675> I know, that Finder doesn't have that functionality by default. As I've mentioned, I use the XtraFinder plugin to add that functionality. Now I'm wondering how I can do the same with ForkLift. <comment243677> I thought I had put it straight enough that I wanted to have `Cmd+X` in ForkLift. It's faster to `mv` in the shell if I can't just `Cmd+X` in the file manager. <comment243681> Then put the details in your question. I've had enough of chasing answers for you that you didn't specify you'd tried or eliminated in your question. <comment243682> I'll undelete my previous answers to save anyone else wasting their time. <comment243684> My question clearly states "Now that I'm trying to move to ForkLift I can't find a way to make this command (Cmd+X) work. No shortcut in the preferences can be set for the operation. Is there a workaround?" I can't see how one can state it more obviously, that I need to set a shortcut (Cmd+X) for the file cut operation in ForkLift (like it is possible to do in Finder using XtraFinder). You should've read the question before trying to answer. <comment243685> I'll let the community decide.
