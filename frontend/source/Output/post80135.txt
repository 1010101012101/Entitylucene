Restoring a jailbroken iPhone <body> I'm trying to restore a iPhone 3g I got that was jailbroken. I plugged it into itunes and hit restore and received the error 1015 that it could not be restored. I've tried using the tinyumbrella solution I believe I did it correctly but it did not work. Anyone have any suggestions?  <answer81125> You need to put it in DFU mode before restoring...  This can be done by:  ol liOpen iTunes and connect the iPhone to your Mac or PC./li liPress and hold the Home button and the Sleep/Wake button at the same time. After exactly 10 seconds release the Sleep/Wake button. Continue holding the home button until you iTunes pops up a message telling you that it has detected an iPhone in recovery mode. /li liThe iPhone screen will remain black./li /ol  NOTE***: It may take a few attempts to get your iPhone into DFU mode. Generally, I hold down both buttons then release the Home button just before I think the Apple logo would appear. If you are still holding both buttons down and you see the Apple logo you are holding them down for too long!  <comment92472> What version of iOS? <comment92478> Near duplicate: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/12777/iphone-sleeps-in-recovery-mode/13020#13020 <comment92480> Are you trying to restore to a certain firmware? You may need to upgrade to the latest version your device supports. (4.2.1, I believe)
