About 5 months ago my friend installed a new app by his own apple ID on my phone and now unfortunately I can't sync any app or music.   iPhone 5sbr iTunes version:   12.0.1.26br iOS version:     7.0.4  How can I fix this problem ?  <answer163353> As @patrix said, check the Apple ID under Settings  iTunes and App Store on your phone. Also, make sure you strongDELETED/strong the app your friend bought with their Apple ID before you try syncing to your iTunes on your computer.  Goes without saying, make sure your strongsame/strong Apple ID is used on your iTunes on your computer.  <comment191105> Which user/Apple ID is logged into the App Store *on the phone*? Check in Settings and set back to your ID if necessary.
