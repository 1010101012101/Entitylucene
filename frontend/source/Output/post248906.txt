batch convert audio files in vlc <body> I am trying to add some files to iTunes: some .wma files which it will not import, and some .m4a files which it will import but not play because it does not know bitrate or duration.  I have tried the following:  ul liconverting with VLC: the files all play fine in VLC but I can only convert them one at a time, despite being able to give multiple files as input for transcoding, which implies batch conversion should be possible./li liusing ffmpeg to convert the files. This gives the error:  precodedyld: Library not loaded: /opt/local/lib/libx264.142.dylib   Referenced from: /opt/local/bin/ffmpeg   Reason: no suitable image found.  Did find:     /opt/local/lib/libx264.148.dylib/libx264.142.dylib: stat() failed with errno=20` /code/pre/li /ul  when I try to reinstall ffmpeg in homebrew, building from source, as suggested in this question on github I get the error message codeError: SHA256 mismatch/code.  There must be a simple way to batch convert files, either with vlc or command-line tools. How?  <answer249176> I haven't tried VLC for batch conversion, or CLI alternatives, but searching on Google returns Mediahuman on first place. It's a free app and it can work with .wma.  I haven't used it -install with care, watch for uninvited crapware.  I've used fre:ac with great success for batch processing. It's open source and free.      It currently works with MP3, MP4/M4A, WMA, Small Vorbis iconVorbis,   Small FLAC iconFLAC, AAC, WAV and Bonk formats.
