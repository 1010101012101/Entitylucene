How do I stop marking mail as read caused by looking at the preview pane? <body> I use Mountain Lion.  How do I prevent Mail.app (6.0) from marking a message as read automatically, just because I have looked at it in the preview pane?  <answer58834> You can change the mark as read delay to a great value, for example 30 seconds, by typing the following in the Terminal:  precodedefaults write com.apple.Mail MarkAsReadDelay 30 /code/pre  (NB: A value of -1 will disable marking as read from Preview if the preview window is hidden.  Tested on Mail 5.2/OSX 10.7.4)  <answer58837> An other way to do do (without using the Terminal), is installing TruePreview. It's an 3th party app which allows you to do exactly what you expect.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QvYM3.png" alt="enter image description here"  Do check for a recent version of TruePreview as older versions don't work well with Mountain lion.  <comment71485> The latest release 1.8a4 supports ML - http://christianserving.org/project/truepreview/releases <comment71952> The *defaults write* isn't being recognized by Mail.app in Mountain Lion. Recent versions of TruePreview weren't working either, but the latest build now works. <comment85809> I don't want to install that plugin though. What defaults write command will work in ML? <comment120778> Do you need to log out and log in again? I executed that in Mac OS X 10.8.4 but no effect. I doubt they removed the ability to do it even if it's not documented. <comment136983> This don't work in Mavericks
