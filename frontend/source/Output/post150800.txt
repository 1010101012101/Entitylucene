Cannot update to XCode 6.0.1 <body> When I press update or update all buttons in app store on my OS X it shows a loading animation and does nothing. Before this it was asking for more space. I have freed a space and now it is 8.88Gb available. That should be enough right?  <answer150801> That should be enough space. Try downloading Xcode from the Apple Developer Downloads section. You may have more luck there.  <comment177454> thanks. Is it equivalent to updating with AppStore? <comment177455> It seems to be, yes. <comment177463> This saved my ass. Thanks buddy! :) <comment177464> You're welcome :)
