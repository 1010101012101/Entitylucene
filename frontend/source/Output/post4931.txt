Apple TV subtitles <body> How can I find out if (and what languages) subtitles are included in Apple TV movies before i buy it?  <answer4953> Is this for translation or closed-captioning purposes? The languages a movie supports should be listed in iTunes, and all of the movies emshould/em (but might not) have closed-captioning for those with disabilities.  <comment4968> When you buy a movie on iTunes, is there any difference if you buy it via an AppleTV or not? <comment4989> Probably not. Is there a way to find it out in iTunes? <comment4991> I'm non native English speaker, so it helps me to understand the spoken text better if i can read it as well. That's what I need it for.
