Open Image in New Window did not work at Safari's Web Inspector mode <body> I opened a website in Safari, opened strongShow Web Inspector/strong, selected one of images from the strongImages/strong folder, right-clicked and selected strongOpen Image in New Window/strong, and it did not open a new folder.  I used Chrome and used strongInspect Element/strong- strongOpen Image in New Tab/strong, and Chrome opened the image in new tab.  Is there some problem with Safari or my MacBook Air?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PG0OB.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer209515> Follow these steps to fix safari issue  ol liGo to Develop -- User Agent -- Safari .../li liSelect it and do inspect then you can see the button on left side top corner./li liNow set to default setting by redoing the first point./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aeMIy.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment147524> I suspect you meant 'open in a new window' not 'open in a new folder.' In any case, this occurs for me as well in Safari 7.0.2 (9537.74.9). For the record, the other options, 'Download Image' and 'Copy Image' work as expected. I just filled out a feedback form @ apple here: http://www.apple.com/feedback/safari.html and described the problem. You should take a minute and send feedback as well. <comment147547> @IconDaemon Thank you, I have filled out a feedback, too.
