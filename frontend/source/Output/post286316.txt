My AirPods connected to Macbook doesnt work when I connected two displays to macbook <body> Simply:  ul liconnected my headphones (mini jack)/li liconnected first display (Thunderbolt 3)/li liconnected second display (HDMI)/li /ul  and the effect is following:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bGC3e.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Couldnt set the volume, the music from iTunes doesnt play sound on my headphones.  But... when I disconnect BOTH displays:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1mqP7.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  iTunes plays music beautifully on my headphones.  Why it doesnt work with displays connected?  <comment361273> Check your audio output! I'd guess your audio output has Thunderbolt or HDMI selected instead of your headphones
