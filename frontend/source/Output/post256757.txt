Can I use DDR3L 1600MHz cl11 memory on my late 2011 13" MacBook Pro? <body> I've been waiting for Apple to announce updated MacBook Pro models, but so far all we have are rumours. At the moment, I'm growing impatient with my late 2011 MBP that seems to be showing its age, so I'm thinking about doing some RAM upgrade as a quick solution. I currently have 4GB in mine and I'm considering upgrading to at least 8GB. I've seen many articles around the Web about the topic of RAM compatibility with old MBPs, but so far I haven't seen this specific question. I've been trying to look for RAM whose specs are as close to what Apple say my machine supports, but I'm finding it difficult to find them in my area. The only ones available are of the specs I've posted. So, will this kind of module work with my late 2011 13" MBP?  I'm thinking about buying one unit, and testing it out for compatibility first. Does my machine have built-in diagnostics tool to check?
