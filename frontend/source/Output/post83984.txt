iTunes Media Folder Location seems to act oddly <body> I have a separate partition setup for my Media.  If I set it to F:\ the structure for music is:  F:\{Artist}\{Album}...  If I set it to F:\Music the structure for music is:  F:\Music\Music\{Artist}\{Album}  How can I set it up so that the media is stored F:\Music\{Artist}\{Album}?  <answer84053> In iTunes, go to the File menu, then select "Organize Library" and tick the box next to "Reorganize files in the folder 'music'".    <comment96695> This will work temporarily to accomplish your objectives. However, iTunes on my Mac does a similar thing. It places some of my music in "[location]/iTunes Media" and some of my music in "[location]/iTunes Media/Music". It is highly annoying and AppleCare was unable to resolve it for me. I can organize my library but it will inevitably start separating new imported material out again randomly.
