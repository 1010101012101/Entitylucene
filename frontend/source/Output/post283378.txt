Mid 2012 Macbook Pro fans spin fast when resuming from sleep even when system is cool <body> Sometimes (about once a month) my Mid 2012 MacBook Pro Fans start spinning  at full speed when resuming from sleep. None of the temperature show as hot.  One cool morning, the highest temperature sensor reading was 81F (27C) degrees and the rest were below 77F (25C).  If I suspend it again by closing the lid, the fans do not slow down, in fact they keep running at the same high speed (5500 to 5900 RPM).  The only way to get the fans to slow/stop to "normal" is to perform a SMC reset.    I don't mind the fans spinning fast when the system is hot, but it is really annoying and seems like a bug when they spin fast when the system is cold. Is there any hope of preventing this from reoccurring?  The SMC version is 2.3f35. MacOS Sierra is version 10.12.4
