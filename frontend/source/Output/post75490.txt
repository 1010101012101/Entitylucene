How do I view disk usage on my desktop computer icon? <body> How do I get disk usage information on my 'Machintosh HD' icon on my desktop?  I did it on my old computer, so I know it's possible, but can't seem to find the option again.  I am on MacOSX 10.8.2.  <answer75491> Right-click a blank location (e.g. not on an icon) on your desktop and click 'Show View Options'.  Check the 'Show item info' box:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WL3zd.png" alt="Desktop View Options"  The effect happens immediately.  <answer75492> Command i will show you the info panel for any file or folder in finder  <comment87647> Doing `Command`+`J` will Show the View options too. <comment87650> While true, this doesn't answer the OP's question.
