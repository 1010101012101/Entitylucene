Using iTunes match, my collection seems peppered with songs that cut out before their full length <body> Using iTunes match, my collection seems peppered with songs that cut out before their full length.  An example: A song would be 5 minutes long, the song timer would show it as being 5 minutes long, but after 3 minutes, the song just cuts out and there's nothing playing for the remaining 2 minutes.  Has anyone else encountered this? Better yet resolved it?  <answer35606> Maybe the file is corrupt, try another file. If the file is corrupt delete it and download it again.   <answer107018> Use the “Get Info” screen and go to the “Options” tab. See if you have accidentally added a Stop Time (the box will be checked and/or the text field will say 3:00).  Just something to check!  <comment40539> first thing to ask, have you checked your internet connection? <comment40541> Yes - it's fine; these were re-downloaded and no interruptions were reported. Also I would expect itunes to tell me if a download was interrupted. <comment40542> and are you listening to these on a Mac or iDevice? <comment40543> Both -- iPhone and iTunes (on Win7) <comment40544> and the issue is on both? or just one? <comment40545> Sorry -- both it seems to be the file itself. However, if I deleted and redownload it, it's fine - I just don't want to have to do this for my 16gb+ worth of files :-) .... <comment40557> I've had download and upload corruption on a small handful of files. And this is why I haven't really gone crazy with iTunes match upgrades yet except with a small number of albums. <comment55819> I had the same thing on one track from an album I bought on iTunes last week. The customer advisor told me to redownload it, which worked. So maybe this is a general problem with iTunes. <comment55910> I've just set up a new iTunes match against a new iPhone, and am having the same problem as described here. Re-downloading doesn't seem to fix it. Also worth noting - deleting the song from iTunes, and then downloading from match on my Mac produces a working song - it is only the phone that has trouble. <comment95016> Are they **matched songs** or **uploaded songs**?
