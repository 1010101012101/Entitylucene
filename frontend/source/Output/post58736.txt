Is there a way to stick a window? <body> Is it possible to choose a window and force it to be sticky (stay in front) if I switch to another application?  <answer58738> There's no built-in functionality like this, but you could try something like Afloat, which adds this and some other window management options. However it does require SIMBL, which is a bit hacky, and can result in bugginess, especially on newly released OSes, where the developers may not have had as much time to test.  <comment67638> What do you understand with "sticky"? Do you want to keep the window in front or show on all desktops or something else? <comment67640> Sticky for me means that even if I focus another window the sticky window will not be hidden and will still be shown
