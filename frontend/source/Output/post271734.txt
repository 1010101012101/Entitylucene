How to convert an .iso file to .dmg in terminal? <body> I want to convert an code.iso/code to code.dmg/code, how can I do this from Terminal?  <answer271735> OS X has codehdiutil/code, a command line tool for making, manipulating and using disk images with an option to convert between different types of images.1   To do this use the command with verb codeconvert/code and option code-format/code.  Option code-o/code is used to specify the path and name of the output file.  There are several formats available from which I post two for .DMG and one for .ISO:  precode  UDRW - UDIF read/write image   UDRO - UDIF read-only image   UDTO - DVD/CD-R master for export /code/pre  Use the first one for a read/write-able .DMG. The resulting command is:  precodehdiutil convert /path/file.iso -format UDRW -o /path/file.dmg /code/pre  The backward conversion would be done by  precodehdiutil convert /path/file.dmg -format UDTO -o /path/file.iso /code/pre  <comment341602> Possible duplicate of [Creating A Bootable USB Of Windows 8.1 On OS X?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/103874/creating-a-bootable-usb-of-windows-8-1-on-os-x) <comment341607> It's the same question and same answer just yours is more general in scope.
