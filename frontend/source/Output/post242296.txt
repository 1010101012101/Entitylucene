How to add another integrated dictionary to iOS9 <body> I am learning Russian language and I was wondering if I could add a Russian-English dictionary to built-in dictionaries of iOS. I want to be able to look up Russian words in iBooks app without leaving the app.   <answer242317> ul liTap on the word you want to define to select it and activate the popup./li liTap on codeDefine/code to call up the dictionary./li liTap on codeManage/code in the lower-left corner./li liIf you find yourself in the word details screen, check for the code&lt; Dictionary/code selection on the upper-left to back to that screen./li liTap the emiCloud/em button beside any extra dictionaries you want to download./li liTo delete a dictionary, swipe left and select codeDelete/code./li /ul  I've found this to be hit-and-miss.  Some dictionaries will show-up and some will not.  I don't know why but hopefully the dictionaries you want will be displayed.  <answer283092> I use Yandex.Translate by Yandex LLC https://appsto.re/us/Vr50I.i  ol liGet it from App Store/li liSet in the settings Russian/li liIn Safari, Chrome, iBooks or somewhere else select word or phrase/li liPress Share, and choose Translate  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EMzdD.jpg" alt="enter image description here"/li /ol  Sorry, but I can't add more images because I'm beginner   <comment297983> There's no way yet for users to add integrated reference dictionaries to iOS as far as I know.  (It can be done for OS X, however.) <comment298038> But there is NO Russian - English dictionary provided by Apple so this will not be of any help.  You should delete this answer. <comment298042> @TomGewecke I won't delete the answer because it answers the question in the title about how to add a dictionary in ios. While there is a Russian dictionary available there isn't a built-in one for translation. Someone could make one and this is how you add it.  I'm sure you down voted the answer for that reason. <comment298070> Unfortunately It makes you look like you were unable to understand the actual question, which is how to add one which is not built in, and is of no help to the person who asked it. <comment298078> I disagree.  In fact, it does make your comment completely incorrect because you stated "There's no way yet for users to add integrated reference dictionaries to iOS..." yet I just showed that it is possible.  Now the OP just has to find the specific translation dictionary he wants, or any kind of dictionary, actually, and I provided the instructions for adding it. <comment298111> Only Apple can add such dictionaries.  There is no way for the user to "find" one anyplace other than inside iOS.  That is the whole point of this question.  Many people want to add new dictionaries to the built-in ones but it's not possible.  You don't seem to be aware of that fact. <comment298277> it used to be possible in an older iOS version. I think I had done that in my good old iPhone 3G. So, I thought maybe there was a hack for it. Just to make it clear, my older iPhone was 'Jailbroken'!
