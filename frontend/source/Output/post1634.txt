Any other action may void your warranty.  <answer1636> It depends on which one you have. I have replaced LCDs and glass screens on the 3G before. Following tutorials at Repairs Universe is really helpful. They have videos and detailed instructions. Here's a tutorial. I haven't looked at it, but it popped up by Googling "replace iPhone battery."   Hope this helps!br Thomas  <answer30616> iFixit has excellent text and video guides for replacing the battery on all models of the iPhone.  Here's their iPhone 4 battery replacement guide.  <comment35127> *IF* it's within warranty - it is *very* helpful. Your battery will be covered. They'll replace the phone. <comment277720> I have successfully replaced my iPhone 5 screen using this guide a few months ago. (The procedure is very similar to replacing the battery; obviously both require opening the phone.) <comment304501> Protip: I found I needed a much stronger suction cup than the simple one included by iFixit. I used one from a vehicle windshield GPS-mount that has a plastic lever-clamp to really make it suction down hard on the glass. That was perfect and popped the screen loose about 10 times easier!
