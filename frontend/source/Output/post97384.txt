Can I recover deleted Safari shortcut icons in iOS? <body> In iOS 6, I accidentally deleted non-app icons that were made using Safari browser.   Is there a way to recover them?  <comment114239> Help us to help you. Give us bit more information, like deleted from where? <comment114249> The only way you can recover them is if you bookmarked those Safari bookmarks before making them shortcut icons. <comment114267> Won't be way from Iphone itself.   It is just an URL to a web-address.   If it is something that you used often you should remember what it was and redo it.   Otherwise you might find something in the backup in Itunes if you have one... not sure about the structure of that file though
