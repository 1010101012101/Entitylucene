iPad: how do I sync whole folders using any cloud platform? <body> I've recently purchased an iPad and I need to keep a folder of files synced to it for offline usage. In my desktop computer I use Dropbox, and I can't find a way to do the same on the iPad. It seems Dropbox, iCloud, Google Drive and MSFT OneDrive all allow setting individual files as offline but not whole folders. Is there ANY platform that allows syncing whole folders, or is this an iOS limitation?  Thanks!
