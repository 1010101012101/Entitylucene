Why do I have repeated "Are you sure you want to open it?" messages when launching applications? <body> My Security settings are set to "Mac App Store and identified developers". I'm still getting this problem though I've allowed the app to run more than once as an Administrator. Specific apps that are experiencing this problem are Coda 2 by Panic, PDFpenPro by Smile Software, and Firefox.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nsMau.jpg" alt="&quot;Coda 2&quot; is an application downloaded fro the Internet. Are you sure you want to open it? Safari downloaded this file on August 29, 2012"  Panic and Smile Software are identified developers if I'm not mistaken. And Transmit by Panic opens fine without these warnings.  Any idea why this is the case?  <answer62724> Solved the problem! The quarantine metadata was not clearing correctly for some reason. I fixed this by doing:  precodesudo xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Coda\ 2.app /code/pre  Big thanks to Thomas Reed in the Apple discussion forums - Link to answer.  <answer62727> If other applications keep showing the dialogs, you could also try disabling the quarantine warnings completely with codedefaults write com.apple.LaunchServices LSQuarantine -bool false/code. It also disables the warnings shown by Gatekeeper even if it was enabled in System Preferences.  <comment72411> And this is every time you launch these apps even after confirming the dialog? I'd try Repair Disk Permissions first in Disk Utility. <comment72418> @Gerry just tried that and found some permissions errors but unfortunately the problem still persists :( <comment72419> Have you tried [rebuilding the Launch Services database](http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20071102084155353)? <comment72420> Tried that and I got: `-bash: /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister: No such file or directory`  Is that the correct command? I'd appreciate it if you could repost in pastebin.com <comment72426> I edited the comment a few minutes after sending it. Stack Exchange inserts ZERO-WIDTH NON-JOINER characters in the middle of long strings without spaces. <comment102007> Thanks! That was getting annoying---for me it was Adium <comment285140> This was the answer I was looking for; it worked perfectly! Thank you.
