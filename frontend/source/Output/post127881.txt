Text not displaying correctly <body> We just recently got new iMacs at work, and we're all having the same issue  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wCcP4.jpg" alt="Screenshot"   Not only do we get characters like those in all web browsers, but even some apps!  Is there a way to fix the characters? We've tried changing default fonts without success :(  I'm running 10.9.2  The problem happens in local apps as well, not just browsers. How can I check fonts integrity?  <answer127886> In your Applications folder, there is an app called Font Book.  Open this app and go to File â†’ Restore Standard System Fonts. This will remove any non-standard fonts on your system and reinstall any missing standard fonts.  <answer186809> Go to font book and disable Helvetica font family  <comment149857> Try a safe boot  http://support.apple.com/kb/PH14204  Have you added any non-Apple font to these machines?  It looks like a junk version of the Last Resort Font substituting for Latin.
