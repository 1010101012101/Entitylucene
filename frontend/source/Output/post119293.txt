how to install hypre using terminal on OS X 10.9.1 <body> I want to install the lastest version of Hypre. It must be safe So using terminal is the safest way. I have brew.   My question is : How can I do this using the terminal ?   <answer119300> I don't really understand why you say it's safer to install it from the terminal. It's (almost) the same when you install it from the GUI.   Since the official website uses a form with a CGI, you'll have to download the installer from your browser.   <answer167188> Did you try codebrew tab homebrew-science/code and then codebrew install hypre/code?  <comment139207> Yes I installed and unpacked it already but the problem is when I follow the instructions it says on terminal type ./configure but nothing happens . That is the problem. <comment139212> I searched on the net and sites I have read are saying hypre is not provided for mac. <comment196023> Hypre is not available in any default tap. Could you add the tap that includes hypre? <comment196027> @grgarside you are wrong. `$ brew search hypre` results `homebrew/science/hypre` <comment196029> @jherran That's exactly what I tried, [image](http://i.stack.imgur.com/2RYHL.png)
