Airport Broadcom Kext Using lots of RAM? <body> I'm seeing a lot of memory consumption by my kernel_task process (800MB-1.2GB) and in debugging, I'm noticing that the airport kernel extension seems to be using the most RAM.    If I use...  codekextstat | awk 'NR==1{ printf "%10s %s\n", $5, $6; } NR!=1{ printf "%10d %s\n", $5, $6; }' | sort -n/code  ...to see which kext is using the most memory in kernel_task, I see the  Broadcom controller listed as the major memory hog.  code7086080 com.apple.driver.AirPort.Brcm4360/code  I've tried a SMC and PRAM reset as well as throwing away my Networkinterfaces.plist, etc and restarting the computer.  Any ideas?  <comment329791> 800-1.2GB is normal for daily usage.
