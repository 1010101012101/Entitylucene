Disable shape detection in Preview's annotation tools <body> When I try to draw a line on an image using Preview's annotation tools, it doesn't remain as I drew it but instead the line is drawn linear. How can I set it to be preset as nonlinear?  So looking to the images, I don't want it to be set like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/obRTK.jpg" alt="Linear"  Instead I want it to be preset in this way, instead of clicking the actual function everytime to make it nonlinear.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0ACzg.png" alt="Non Linear"  <answer272486> It's currently not possible to disable the shape detection used by default in the markup tools.     If your drawing is recognized as a standard shape, it’s replaced by that shape; to use your drawing instead, choose it from the palette that’s shown.   suphttps://support.apple.com/kb/PH20218/sup  You can provide feedback to Apple here:  ul lihttp://www.apple.com/feedback/macosx.html/li /ul
