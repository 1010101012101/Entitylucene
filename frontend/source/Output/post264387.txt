Google Play Music Manager doesn't upload on macOS Sierra <body> Whenever I try to upload my iTunes library to Google Music, I use Music Manager. However, ever since I upgraded to macOS Sierra, Music Manager has stopped functioning properly, instead hogging the CPU while stalling the progress bar within the its own System Preferences.  Is there a way to resolve this and make Music Manager functional again on Sierra?
