error no such device entering rescue mode grub rescue <body> I am using one strongMacbook Pro with OSX 10.7.5 Lion/strong. Yesterday I was experimenting to install strongdebian 8 in my flash drive/strong. It was successful.  I started from holding down strongoption key/strong in my keyboard. Then choose, boot from my flash drive. After installing Debian in my flash drive, I removed it.  Now the problem is everytime I start my laptop. It is showing the following screen. I need to hold down the option key to select Mac HD for entering into my os.  How can I solve this strongGRUB/strong issue!!!  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9qqEr.jpg" alt="enter image description here"
