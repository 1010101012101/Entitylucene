How to change Bluetooth channel used by Google Earth <body> This might be more a Google Earth issue, but here goes.  I've paired my Mountain Lion laptop with a Garmin Bluetooth GPS, and can confirm getting NMEA data over the serial channel with  codecat /dev/tty.GarminGPS10-Gps10/code  However, when I try to connect to the GPS inside Google Earth, I see the message     Reading /dev/cu.Bluetooth-PDA-Sync   and nothing happens. How do I point Google Earth to the proper tty?  I've tried:  ul liremoving my Android phone from know Bluetooth devices/li lireinstalling Google Earth and reinstalling/li /ul  <answer74806> Solved it.  Seems Google Earth cycles through all available COM ports until it finds a feed. Left it on for a while and it connected to the correct port eventually
