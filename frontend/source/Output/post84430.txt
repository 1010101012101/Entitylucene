Remove _specific_ items from Finder Open With menu <body> Is there any way to purge emspecific/em applications from the Finder's "Open With" menu? Mine is cluttered with all sorts of applications I'd never choose to open HTML files with (Word, Calibre, all sorts of undesirables; see image). I know there're various tricks to remove duplicates or uninstalled applications, but I'd just like to prune.  strongFailing that/strong, is there a way to move an app higher in the list (I'd like Sublime Text 2 higher up the list), or simply to bypass the menu and open the file in the two applications I'm actually interested in opening it with (Sublime and Chrome, essentially).  Running 10.7 Lion, if applicable.   <answer84432> You can't do that. It used to be possible, using something like Open-With Manager, but changes in 10.7 prevented this from working. I've not seen any other hacks to do this since.  <answer84445> This might do the trick. Under code~/Library/Preferences/code you'll find a file called codecom.apple.LaunchServices.plist/code. This file lists the preferred applications to emopen with/em for the different formats.  Opening the file with an editor such as TextMate should let you edit the associations.  <answer84467> Never say never. You can do that (albeit manually from the command line) with a CLI called lsregister - code/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister/code. It can be used to either register launchers or unregister there. code-dump/code will show you all the present associations, and code-unregister/code can be used to selectively remove.  <answer84491> You can for example open code/Applications/calibre.app/Contents/Info.plist/code and remove entries from the CFBundleDocumentTypes array. To apply the changes, run codesudo touch /Applications/calibre.app//code or code/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -f /Applications/calibre.app//code and relaunch Finder.  If the application is signed, it invalidates the code signature. And since 10.8 some applications like TextEdit and Chess have crashed on launch if the Info.plist has been modified.  <answer84498> RCDefaultApp can do it and it has a nice GUI.  See this blog post for a quick explanation of how to use RCDefaultApp   <comment97252> `lsregister -f -u /Applications/SomeApp.app/` only removes the application temporarily. The application gets registered again when it is opened.
