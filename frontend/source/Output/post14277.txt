How to Kiosk Mode a Web Page OSX - Chrome <body> I have to let members of the public use my laptop to access a member signup web page at a student fair in a couple of weeks.  Chrome doesn't have kiosk mode on Mac, is it possible to disable CMD+Q, prevent the title bar from showing up etc..?  Is there software designed for this?  Any other advice?  <answer14279> Have you considered using strongOpera/strong as a browser for the signup. It does provide a kiosk mode that is easy to enable:  /Applications/Opera.app/Contents/MacOS/Opera -kioskmode -noexit  The documentation has information about a 'Go To Home' timeout mode that will restore the kiosk after a set interval.  <answer14287> There's a plugin called Saft which enables kiosk mode in Safari. (Saft has been discontinued as of late 2012; it doesn't work beyond Safari 5.0.5.) If the computer is being used in public, create a new guest user in the system preferences and use this one for the fair. Even if somebody breaks out of the kiosk mode, they can't see your private data or mess anything up.  If you want to stay with Chrome, there's an AppleScript on Superuser, to launch Chrome in kiosk mode.  <answer14514> try eCrisper from http://ecrisper.com  <answer98512> If you setup a new user in System Preferences and setup the parental controls to let it have a simple finder then you can allow only Chrome to be opened and you can set it up so that the only webpage allowed to be accessed is your webpage.  <answer119978> It's tricky but I managed to get Chrome in a proper kiosk mode. By editing the Chrome's codeInfo.plist/code in the package contents you can force it to hide the menu bar in presentation mode (set codeLSUIPresentationMode/code to code3/code). The codeContinue where I left off/code setting might help.  Use parental controls to block or white list websites.  There is a Chrome plugin called kioskmodehelper that limits tabs and hides ui elements.  <answer133095> http://barbariangroup.com/ Makes a free Mac kiosk WebKit based app called PlainView.  Check it out, it's quite configurable.  <answer142891> I'm working on a minimalist kiosk webviewer whose only purpose it is to provide a secured container for a predefined url/webapp. Features basically are:  ul liNormal-/Kiosk-Mode/li liOptional password protection for leaving Kiosk-Mode/li liPredefined URL (aimed at webapp)/li liOptional Webapp admin URL/li liIn-App registration as login/startup application/li /ul  Could do with some tweaks and further "hardening" but serves its purpose - and it's open source for that matter.  https://github.com/tschiemer/filmothek-kiosk-osx  <answer232074> Chrome has a Kiosk mode for Mac OS. Sort of. You can pass it command line args to get the kiosk mode as follows:  [22:34:02] ~ /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --kiosk 192.168.168.53  = This opens a chrome window without any window decorations, maximized to full-screen (like any other Mac App that is maximized.  For all the Chrome command line args check out: http://peter.sh/experiments/chromium-command-line-switches/#load-extension  <answer251609> Open codeScript Editor/code and using the following:  precodeset strUrl to "https://example.org" do shell script "/Applications/Google\\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\\ Chrome --app=" &amp; strUrl  tell application "Google Chrome" to activate tell application "System Events"     keystroke "f" using {command down, control down} end tell /code/pre  This will open a url in app mode as kiosk isn't available on Mac.  It then sends the keys kbdctrl/kbd + kbdcmd/kbd + kbdf/kbd to enter fullscreen as the older shortcut kbdcmd/kbd + kbdshift/kbd + kbdf/kbd no longer seems to work.  <comment15385> For what it's worth, I think Kiosk mode is enabled but you have to open Chrome from the command line to pass it the --kiosk parameter. That being said, I haven't been able to pass any parameters successfully. <comment15388> You can hide the title bar with fullscreen mode (cmd-shift-F), but the menus are still all enabled. <comment15405> The apple script isn't real kiosk mode, it's just normal full screen. Thanks for the link to safe. <comment15406> --kiosk isn't enabled in OS X as of yet <comment166214> It doesn't work anymore after they switched to Chromium <comment166215> Doesn't work in OS X 10.9: bars are hidden but the user can just hit the top and bottom borders and they will show up. <comment166216> This is what we're using. An alternative could be [xStand](http://www.xstandapp.com/) but it's more expensive
