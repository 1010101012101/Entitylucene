Where are the Thunderbolt components? <body> I've been looking around for a few weeks now and still dont see any Thunderbolt adapters, like a SATA/eSATA adapter or anything similar, is it still too soon ? i just havent seen anything on Newegg or anywhere else.  <answer14528> h3Currently Thunderbolt is advanced hi tech Vapor Ware./h3  There are a few prototype external drives floating around but until I can physically plug delsomething/del multiple Thunderbolt enabled devices (as promised) in to my MacBook Pro it doesn't exist.  I love my MacBook Pro but Apple mis-represented Thunderbolt in it's initial marketing.  The multi monitor display capability specs were removed from the website.   .  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/phqLb.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer15391> See the recent Computex event for information on that. Promise and LaCie demoed Thunderbolt-capable storage devices slated for a Summer release.  <answer18779> Check out Apple Thunderbolt Display:  http://www.apple.com/displays/  It's a Thunderbolt - Firefwire, USB, Ethernet, and Thunderbolt adapter.  <comment15680> To be fair, you can plug in a monitor that supports Mini DisplayPort. <comment15681> Very true.  I have mine plugged into a 27" Cinema Display.  I just felt like I was mislead into thinking I would be able to use Thunderbolt to connect 2 displays and an external drive to the port. (It's coming soon) <comment15694> Reality begs to differ if you actually have two Thunderbolt ports (27" iMac): http://www.engadget.com/2011/05/03/apple-imac-hands-on-with-dual-30-inch-displays-video/ Now if someone released a monitor that actually chained correctly... <comment17752> Any word on Thunderbolt -- FireWire adapters? I'm looking to replace my ageing MacBook with one of the upcoming 13 inch Airs. I have a FireWire sound card though and I'd need an adapter to hook it up. <comment17753> For those interested, someone pointed me here -- http://www.sonnettech.com/news/nab2011/index.html. <comment18548> @Chris_O regarding multiple monitors - you can do that. http://www.engadget.com/2011/05/03/apple-imac-hands-on-with-dual-30-inch-displays-video/ How's that for your "Thunderbolt doesn't exist"? <comment18920> Would you perhaps edit this to make it less of a temporary and subjective. What exactly are you looking to do with eSATA or similar adaptors?
