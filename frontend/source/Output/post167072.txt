SSD upgrade for 2013 21" iMac? <body> I have got an iMac (EMC 2638) here, with 1TB hard drive. I have read that there is a PCIe SSD slot on those iMacs as well, originally for the fusion drive. Is it possible to upgrade my iMac with such a SSD module? I don't care if it would work as a fusion drive, or simply have it as the main drive for OS and programs.   If this is possible, where can I buy such a SSD module? iFixit has repair instructions, but maybe I can let this be done by my local Mac shop.  <answer167182> It seems there is a workaround for this. One can buy an external Thunderbolt SSD, and set up a Fusion Drive. Since Thunderbolt is extremely fast, this is a low cost, low work solution that is very suitable for desktop machines like the iMac.  There are a lot of guides online on how to set up the disks.  It boils down to   ol liBacking up your machine using Time Machine/li liInstall OS X onto a third external drive./li liBoot from said drive./li liCreate fusion drive over external SSD and internal HD./li liReboot from fusion drive and re-install OS X, restore from Time Machine/li /ol  Maybe one can skip the install to external HD, since newer Macs come with Internet Recovery. This would save quite a bit of work.  Once in recovery, you can see your disks using codediskutil list/code. Let's say you see the disks disk1s2 (internal HD, OS X partition) and disk2 (clean SDD).  Now you can create the Fusion Drive:  precodesudo diskutil cs create [ArbitraryName] disk2 disk1s2 sudo diskutil cs createVolume [UUID] jhfs+ [ArbitraryName] 100% /code/pre  The output of the first command results in a UUID which you use in the second command.  After this, you should be able re-install or restore OS X onto the Fusion Drive.  I haven't tried this yet, it is merely a summary of the linked article! So be careful and make backups!  <comment196017> I often wish someone brought Thunderbolt thumb drives to the market.  They'd be scary fast. <comment196047> That'd be a great idea. For an upgrade fusion drive, 64GB would probbly be enough. Ose could probably be manfuctured with rather rather small cases.
