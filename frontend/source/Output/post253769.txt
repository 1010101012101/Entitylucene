With Safari, can I allow pop-ups for specific sites? <body> I have chosen "Block popup windows" in Safari's security tab, yet there are a couple of sites for work that still use popups for login etc. Is there a way to add exceptions (in advanced settings or directly in the plist file perhaps?) Or maybe via a Safari extension?  <answer253827> There isn't any exception list for popups in Safari.  It's an "all-or-nothing" approach for now.   I recommend telling Apple your thoughts on the Safari feedback page: http://www.apple.com/feedback/safari.html  <comment315958> use Adblocker, allow pop-ups in safari, then add a rule to addblocker
