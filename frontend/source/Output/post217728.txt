Can't Delete Partition <body> I created a partition to run Snow Leopard on my computer running El Capitan and no longer need it. I allocated 20GB to that partition. Here's what I've done. I first go into Disk Utility, select my partition and click 'Erase'. It apparently erases everything but there is still 67.4 MB being used on the partition that I can't remove:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nBtst.png" alt="enter image description here"  If I go into finder this is what I see on that partition:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AD5Yw.png" alt="enter image description here"  Those are hidden files obviously and I can't delete them. I then go to the hard drive itself and click 'Partition' but when I do that and select the partition I want to remove, the minus button isn't an option:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QGfoy.png" alt="enter image description here"  I can't manually resize the partitions either (I want to re-allocate the disk space to my main drive).  Any ideas on why I can't remove the partition?  <answer217784> In Disk Utility, there's a difference between deleting and erasing.  strongErasing/strong a partition simply clears all data on that partition. The leftover .blah files are OS X config things. The partition still exists on the disk, it just now doesn't have anything in it.   strongDeleting/strong a partition means removing the partition from the partition table. That partition will then no longer exist.  From your question, you would like to delete the partition completely.  Thus:  ol liClick on strongApple SSD SM02.../strong at the top of the Disk Utility drive menu. This is the Red box on the image below./li liClick on the strongPartition/strong tab at the top of the window. This is the green box./li liSelect the strongSnow Leopard/strong partition, then click the strongminus sign/strong at the bottom of the partition display. This is the purple box./li liClick strongApply/strong, and Disk Utility will work its magic. This is the black box./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fWkeK.png" alt="Disk Utility Partition Deletion Steps"  The names and OS X version in the image are different(I think that is from 10.9), but the steps and buttons are the same.   strongEDIT:/strong This may be a workaround if you do not have the minus button:  ol liMake a Time Machine backup of your main OS X hard drive. It is probably a good idea you store this on an external hard drive or in the cloud./li liRestart your Mac in Recovery mode by holding down Command + R when you turn it back on/li liGo to Disk Utility /li liReformat the Snow Leopard partition as OS X Journaled  through the erase tab/li liNow try to delete the partition /li /ol  <answer232586> I solved this on my external drive using diskutil to merge the problem partition with a following partition.  Update: Klanomath points out this won't work if you've booted from the disk you want to modify.  strongNote: Data will only be preserved on one of the partitions (the first mentioned in the codediskutil mergePartitions .../code command) so create a backup first if you need to./strong  Get a list of partitions on the drive. Leave out the disk identifier codedisk2/code if you want to see all disks  precodediskutil list disk2 /code/pre  Merge the problem partition with the following partition giving the merged partition a name, say codeMyNewPartition/code  precodediskutil mergePartitions HFS+ MyNewPartition disk2s2 disk2s3 /code/pre  This results in all the data from codedisk2s3/code being deleted and codedisk2s2/code being extended into the space that was used by codedisk2s3/code  In my case the merged partition still could not be resized or deleted in Disk Utility but at least I had removed the unwanted partition.  <answer256882> I've had the same issue in El Capitan. The instructions above which feature the old version of Disk Utility are obsolete as the new version (El Capitan and up) does not offer the same set of options.  That said, in order to remove the extra partition for which the minus button was greyed out, I simply rebooted into Recovery Mode (CMD+R during boot) and ran Disk Utility from there. The button was no longer greyed out.  Hope this helps!  <comment263224> Is either partition encrypted? Are you running FileVault at all? <comment263250> @ash, I don't believe so. I haven't done either of those (and haven't really heard of it) so I'm guessing the answer is no. <comment263356> I mentioned in my message that I don't have the option to choose the 'minus' button when I click on the partition. It doesn't give me that option. From other tutorials and threads, they explained that I have to 'erase' the partition first and then remove it which is why I was using erase as well. <comment263359> Yeah, you do have to erase it first. The minus button still isn't avaliable? <comment263375> No it's not available. That's basically the issue here. It's 20 GBs I can't seem to re-allocate to my main drive. <comment263376> Hmmm.... Your best bet then may be to boot into a live CD of Linux and partition from there. **Backup before you do this!!**  I can post a guide if you would like one. <comment263379> Ok if that's the only way than a tutorial would be good but it seems like there must be a simpler solution to it? <comment263411> I may have found a better solution, try the new answer. <comment263845> Thanks Kisa, I'll give this a go after the work day today when I can do my time machine backup and then come back and let you know if it worked. <comment263919> No problem! If it still doesn't work, I'll post the Linux solution. <comment284214> This answer doesn't solve the problem because here the (external) disk is no disk the Mac booted from. Additional you don't have to erase disk2s2: the command `diskutil mergePartitions HFS+ MyNewPartition disk2s2 disk2s3` only deletes the data of the third partition and the second partition is extended while preserving its data! <comment284269> @klanomath If you first created and booted from a clone, would you then be able to merge partitions on the internal disk? <comment284274> If you boot to Internet Recovery Mode you should be able to merge partitions. But disk0s2  and disk0s3 probably are the main OS X volume and the **Recovery HD**. So you'd have to merge disk0s2 and disk0s4 (and all partitions in between) to remove the Snow Leopard partition and rebuild the Recovery HD later.
