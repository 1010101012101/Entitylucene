How to search text in files of all types (including binary)? <body> I want to find some text inside binary files. Is it possible to do in Finder (it skips binary even if I set up "All kinds" of file types)? Otherwise I would be thankful for utility that can do it.  PS: I need to search among many files in directory.  <answer32604> You should use the codestrings/code application in the Terminal.  precodestrings filename(s) | grep text_to_search_for /code/pre  From Wikipedia:     In computer software, strongstrings/strong is a program in Unix-like operating systems that finds and prints text strings embedded in binary files such as executables.   I'm not aware of any way to use Finder to search for text in binary files.   <answer32675> After some digging on Google I found EasyFind.app. This app can search in selected or all file types.  <answer34258> You can try Insider for Mac.  <comment39081> Welcome to Ask Different!
