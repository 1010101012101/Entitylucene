Email notification for specific emails containing "n words" if n > 500 <body> I have an iPhone 5 and, like many of you, I receive emails on it. I do a little bit of translation on the side and receive emails on projects, where the email for example contains the sentence "800 Words".  My question is, is there any way I can adjust my settings such that I only get notifications on emails containing the string "n Words", where n is greater than, say, 500?  Thank you for your time!  <answer259060> If using Gmail or Google Apps (Google for Work or G Suite), filters may be of help. You can make specific email go to a specific folder on arrival, bypassing the inbox.  There is a discussion here on Gmail filters and wildcards that may point you in the right direction for creating the filter. Questions about Gmail will have better (and non-off-topic) answers there.  The problem with this solution is that you won't get notified.  I can think of two ways to get actual notifications from those specific search terms: filter everything that does not match the criteria out of the inbox, so you'll only get notifications from incoming mail that matches, or adding an IFTTT recipe that notifies you when the criteria is fulfilled â€”this looks promising:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yxG5K.png" alt="ifttt Gmail recipe options"  I'd go with "New email in inbox from search" trigger and then enter your search terms. Here is a guide from Google on search operators that allow you to construct a custom search, OR probably, but you'll have to experiment the search syntax that gives you the desired result.  <comment323464> What email service do you have? <comment323978> Hotmail.com. (Apologies for the late reply.) <comment324130> Thank you so much for your time writing this. I will read your post more thoroughly now. <comment324131> Regrettably I cannot upvote your comment due to lack of reputations. <comment324132> You are welcome. I'll add IFTTT's URL on it. You should be able to accept and/or up-vote the answer though. <comment324133> I just noticed that you use hotmail, I'm not sure IFTTT works for it. Sorry for the confusion. I'll update the answer if I find a working solution. <comment324135> No, that is fine. If you recommend me using Gmail then I can just simply change my email from hotmail to gmail. No biggie. <comment324137> @Christopher I do recommend it. Hotmail does not work with IFTTT and I don't know much about its filters or rules. <comment324138> Alright. I will change to Gmail. Thanks again for your time.
