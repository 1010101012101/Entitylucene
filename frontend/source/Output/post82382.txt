how to tab text blocks in terminal input line <body> precode$ I want to be able to tab from the start of one word to the next in this line, but how? /code/pre  usually if I paste something in the input line then want to change something in the start or middle, I have to press  the left arrow for a long time, is there a faster way to do this?  <answer82384> Use kbdoption ⌥/kbd+kbd→/kbd and kbdoption ⌥/kbd+kbd←/kbd. You will be able to step by one word.   strongUpdate:/strong   You can also go to start of the line using kbdcontrol/kbd+kbdA/kbd or to end of the line using kbdcontrol/kbd+kbdE/kbd  <answer82386> If you check Preferences  Settings  Keyboard  Use option as meta key, you can also use ⌥B and ⌥F (and ⌥⌫  will delete a word backward).  Terminal's default settings also affect programs like vim and nano where M-f doesn't go a word forward. I have deleted them and added this to ~/.inputrc:  precode"\e\e[C": forward-word "\e\e[D": backward-word /code/pre  This would also make ⌥⌦ delete a word forward:  precode"\e(": kill-word /code/pre  <answer82387> Press kbdESC/kbd then kbdb/kbd or kbdESC/kbd then kbdf/kbd to go back and forward respectively.  <comment95076> What version of Mac OS X are you running? What works in Terminal from, say, Mountain Lion doesn't always work in, say, Panther or Tiger.
