Mavericks Server: Unable to use 3rd party SSL Certificates with Open Directory <body> We have a Mac OS X Server (Mavericks) - codeMac OS X: 10.9.2/code,  codeServer: 3.1/code  Our Open Directory Master is set up and running but we cannot for the life of us get it to accept our 3rd Party (DigiCert) SSL certificate. The certificate is active for all other services (Mail, Calendar, WWW, Messages) but whenever I select it for Open Directory and click codeOK/code the Server app just reverts back to "None".  I've tried destroying the OD Master and rebuilding it but this didn't help; problem persists.  This seems like a show stopper; anyone know how we can fix this?  <answer221300> I believe Apple fixed that bug in Server 4 but I can't reproduce it on Server 5. Have you checked the codeserveradmin/code command line tool to check your settings and status:  precodesudo serveradmin fullstatus dirserv sudo serveradmin settings dirserv sudo serveradmin -x settings certs /code/pre  The -x argument instructs serveradmin to format the data as XML, which often shows more information (at least in the case of certs).  Sometimes you can set things there that the GUI balks at - but you also want to have the ability to call AppleCare for support or a great backup plan that's tested before mucking with sudo and serveradmin from my experience.  <comment146428> The same thing for me, but with a web server. If I set 3rd party certificate via website settings panel there is some diagnostic in Console log: `Error: The server '127.0.0.1' reported an error while processing a command of type: 'writeSettings' in plug-in: 'servermgr_web'.
