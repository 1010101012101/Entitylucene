Boot from USB iBook G4 Power PC <body> I recently got an old iBook G4 (as many of you might have noticed with all of my recent questions :D) and I wanted to install Ubuntu via USB (the iso doesn't fit on a CD and the iBook doesn't read DVDs, I've tried).  So I went a-searching the internet for ways to do this.   I started off trying to boot from the USB stick via holding down kbdoption/kbd after the chime, but that just listed the Macintosh HD. So I went on searching and came across this: http://ben-collins.blogspot.com/2010/08/booting-your-ibook-g4-from-usb-stick.html and tried it multiple times, but all failed (I believe the iBook wasn't recognizing the USB stick, as nothing came up when I ran codedev usb0/code and then codels/code.)  I then read this question: How do I make my 1.5 GHz PowerBook G4 boot from a USB stick?, but that didn't work, even when I swapped out the suffix code\\yaboot/code for code\\tdxi/code. Sadly, nothing is working!  Does anyone know of any workarounds or something I can do to get this working?  <answer273767> I know this old, but I just solved this problem, and I had found this question while searching for an answer.   In my case, 2005 iBook wouldn't recognise the 10.5 install DVD. I imaged the DVD to an 8GB usb stick in Disk Utility. I did format the USB stick as codeApple Partition Map/code first in case that makes a difference.  It wouldn't boot from the USB when holding down kbdoption/kbd or kbdC/kbd though I could get a menu.  I booted to open firmware by booting with kbdcommand/kbd+kbdoption/kbd+kbdO/kbd+kbdF/kbd then I ran the following command: codeboot usb0/disk@1:3,\\:tbxi/code  It booted into the installer and everything worked as expected.
