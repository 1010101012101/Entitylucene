Where is a reasonable sed? <body> On Yosemite.  The sed is old: does not understand code\t/code for example. I installed codecoreutils/code and can not find any codesed/code associated with same.  What are my options here?  <answer166584> Install fink . You will also need XCode if you haven't got it already.  Then install the latest sed (and lots of other useful things) like this:  codefink install sed/code  <answer166585> You need to install codegnu-sed/code, not just the coreutils:  precodebrew install gnu-sed /code/pre  Then, you have to add the following lines on your code.bash_profile/code:  precodeexport PATH="/usr/local/opt/gnu-sed/libexec/gnubin:$PATH" export MANPATH="/usr/local/opt/gnu-sed/libexec/gnuman:$MANPATH" /code/pre  Then your codesed/code version should be the latest:  precode$ sed --version sed (GNU sed) 4.2.2 Copyright (C) 2012 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

Just ``brew install gnu-sed`` and it will be available as ``gsed`` <comment195237> Fink is getting quite old.  I'd recommend [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) instead. <comment195239> The `PATH` statements lets you use the command `sed` instead of `gsed`. It's not necessary, but you won't need to remember to append the letter `g` to your `sed` command. <comment195244> Sure. But that might interfere with programs that expect ``sed`` to be BSD sed.  I don't know if that's a problem, but I'd expect it to be.  (if osx then bsdisms) <comment195251> @neu242 How is "old" a problem? Unix is 45 years old and we still use it. Fink itself is 6 years, long enough for the issues to be ironed out. Fink (and MacPorts) packages are updated regularly. <comment195277> If you run the stock OS X sed with the `-E` option, it should accept `\t`. See the `re_format` man page for details. <comment195363> `alias sed=gsed` in a profile, maybe? <comment195798> @paul Oh, I've just never encountered anyone using Fink the last 10 years or so.  Good to hear that it's still usable! :) <comment244480> It *should*, but it doesnâ€™t. `echo -e 'foo\tbar' | sed -E 's/\t/blah/'` yields `foo bar` on Mavericks 10.9.5.
