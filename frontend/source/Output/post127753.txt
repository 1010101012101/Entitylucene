How to configure outlook to send me Tracking report for my emails - Office 2011 for mac <body> All,   I want to configure my outlook 2011 for MAC to send me a tracking report for my sent emails.   Note: My Email Hosted by: Office 365.  Any idea?  <answer192137> Here are some instructions on how you can do that. You may also consider using a plugin called sidekick by hubspot. It's a chrome extension that allows you to track emails (not through a program) but I use it with gmail. I don't think it requires permission from the person, which makes it a little less conspicuous.  Let me know if this helps.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/w2VZZ.png" alt="Email Tracking through Outlook"  <comment149670> read receipt and or delivered receipt <comment149671> Prefer Both reports.
