How can I completely disable desktop background change? <body> I need to block the possibility for a single user to change the desktop background, or at least to make it possible only by inserting his password on OS X Lion / Mountain Lion.  I want to lock strongevery/strong possibility, from iPhoto to Safariâ€¦  <answer103458> One possible solution would be to set the permissions on code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.desktop.plist/code to be read-only for the user.  <answer161405> Found a way to stop background changing.    ol liRename code/System/Library/Services/Set\ Desktop\ Picture.workflow/code Change the extension.

Not the best solution, but works for me. <comment148196> Thanks. I may be on the verge of a solution. It seems like the system is caching changes to the preference somewhere else, and doesn't look at the actual plist until it's explicitly reloaded. So if I lock the plist by setting permissions and running `chflags uchg ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.desktop.plist`, then change the desktop image in System Preferences, the image will change. But it will change back if I log in and log out. I'm looking for ways to force that reload (and thus generalize to other prefs) - the CFPreferences stuff in CoreFoundation looks promising, but nothing quite yet. <comment148518> Sorry to bug you again @Napolux, but I've given up on my solution. How were you able to check for the background image? I was trying to get it with `defaults read com.apple.desktop Background`, but that has a few nested dictionaries. defaults isn't equipped to parse them, and I don't want to count on Plist Buddy being available. Are you getting the info another way? If you made your response the Answer to this question, I imagine it'd get some serious upvotes. ;) <comment148581> I have to find out where I hide my script and let you know :P <comment148616> Ha! Thanks. I think I've almost got it using grep and sed to isolate the value I'm looking for, but it'd be great if there were something cleaner. <comment188605> Forgot to add tested on 10.9.5 good luck!!
