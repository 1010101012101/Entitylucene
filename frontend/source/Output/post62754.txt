Resolution 2880 x 1800 not available in Windows 8 (VMware Fusion 5) <body> I've installed Windows 8 in a VMware Fusion 5 virtual machine. Actually, I upgraded the virtual machine from VMware Fusion 4.  I'd like to set my retina MacBook Pro's resolution to the display's native resolution strong2880 x 1800/strong, but Windows doesn't offer the option for that resolution. The maximum is 2560 x 1920 (or 2650 x 1600).  Is there a way to let Windows know that I'm using a 2880 x 1800 display? Do I have to install a monitor driver in Windows?  <answer64273> Can you try if VMware Fusion Technology Preview 2012 does the trick? On the What's new? they list "Added support for Retina-Display resolution with Windows 7 &amp; Windows 8 (Settings  Display)"  <answer64279> Per VMware's Retina KB article, you can enable 1:1 pixel mapping for a Fusion 5 VM by going to strongSettings → Display/strong and checking strongUse full resolution for Retina display/strong.  If after that you don't see the 2880x1800 resolution, you need to make some manual tweaks, following this KB article:  ol liOpen the code.vmx/code file in a text editor./li liAdd the line codesvga.autodetect = "FALSE"/code/li liAdd (or update if it already exists) codesvga.vramSize = 20774912/code/li liAdd (or update if they already exist) codesvga.maxWidth = 2880/code and codesvga.maxHeight = 1800/code/li liSave the file and open your Windows VM./li liIn the Windows registry (Start → Run → coderegedit/code) search for the codevmx_svga/code key. Per the article, "The correct key has several sub-keys, but it is the main key that should be edited."/li liCreate a new string value (REG_SZ) named Resolution.x, where x is one higher than the highest number listed./li liEnter 2880x1800 as the new value./li liRestart Windows./li liOpen the Display Control Panel to change to your new resolution/li /ol
