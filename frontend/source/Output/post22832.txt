How to navigate between screens on the Mac <body> Cmd+tab is like the task switcher in Windows, except it only pulls the menu bar up for the application, and not the application itself.  Q: How do I switch between applications such that the application is visible?  <answer22833> If you're asking what I think you're asking, kbdcmd/kbd+kbd`/kbd will usually cycle between application windows within a single application.  It's also possible you have no application windows open, and you're just getting a menu bar.  Also, this should probably be in the superuser stackexchange.  <answer22842> The application switching process is nearly the same as on Windows (&amp; step 5 is optional :-):  ol likbdCommand/kbd+kbdTab/kbd to your application./li liRelease kbdTab/kbd, but keep holding kbdCommand/kbd./li liPress kbdOption/kbd (which in Mac-Speak is the same as kbdAlt/kbd)./li liRelease kbdCommand/kbd./li liMake smarmy comment about how things are simpler on a Mac./li /ol  <comment25453> Unlike Windows, OSX doesn't require windows to be open for an application to continue running.  So when you hit 'x' on (most) applications it will leave just a menu bar with zero open windows. <comment25454> I've got Finder and Xcode open, and I can't navigate to either of them using the keyboard. <comment25455> Do have any windows open in either of them? <comment25456> Yes, I have windows open in Xcode, but not Finder. <comment25457> I pressed the minimize button, not the 'x'. <comment25461> Ah, I see from your above comment that you've minimized a window. I can't test this now, but it seems that pressing `cmd`+`tab` until you've selected the application and then pressing `option` while releasing will restore the last minimized window. Other than that, I don't know of any way to restore minimized windows. I honestly don't minimize things on OS X very often for exactly this reason. <comment25475> I've used MacOS X since the beginning, and even I didn't know this trick to show hidden windows. Simpler? Maybe. Intuitive? Not in this case. :) <comment25486> That's bizarre. Why go through all that when you can just command-H to hide an app and then have it appear automatically when you command-tab to it? <comment25501> cmd - tab doesn't show minimized windows
