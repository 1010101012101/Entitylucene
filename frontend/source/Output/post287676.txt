Completions for bash 4 never finish loading <body> I've installed bash 4 and bash-completions@2 with Homebrew following all kinds of guides I found online. However, when I open a new terminal it just hangs. By placing some codeecho/codes in my code.bash_profile/code it seems to be hanging on loading the completions.  My code.bash_profile/code:  precode# Import all files for DOTFILE in ~/.{aliases,env,functions,path,prompt,extra} do     [ -r "$DOTFILE" ] &amp;&amp; [ -f "$DOTFILE" ] &amp;&amp; source "$DOTFILE" done  unset DOTFILE;  echo $BASH_VERSION printf "Loading bash completions..." if [ -f /usr/local/share/bash-completion/bash_completion ]; then     . /usr/local/share/bash-completion/bash_completion fi printf "done!"  if [ -f "$(brew --prefix)/opt/bash-git-prompt/share/gitprompt.sh" ]; then     GIT_PROMPT_THEME=Default     source "$(brew --prefix)/opt/bash-git-prompt/share/gitprompt.sh" fi /code/pre  (the codeDOTFILE/code stuff is loading my dotfiles)  When I open a new terminal with the above code.bash_profile/code I get this output:  precodeLast login: Fri Jun 23 10:43:12 on ttys001 4.4.12(1)-release Loading bash completions... /code/pre  Running codebrew doctor/code doesn't say anything about bash completions.  What can I do to get this working?  strongUPDATE/strong There were a bunch of coderustc/code processes taking up a lot of CPU. Most likely related.  <answer287679> It turns out the problem was with coderustc/code. Upgrading the package with codebrew upgrade rust/code fixed it.  My current Rust version is now 1.18.0.
