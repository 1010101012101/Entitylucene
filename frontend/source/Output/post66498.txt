How can I control (start/stop) applications and services that start up after reboot? <body> I have a Mac that is slow when using the internet, but other PCs on the same connection aren't as slow.  I suspect there are too many AV scanners running concurrently, or there is some process that isn't installed by default slowing the whole thing down.  strongQuestion/strong  Where can I find strongall possible applications/strong that will be automatically started when the machine turns on?  (and how do I shut them off)  This should include  ul liApplications on the menu bar on the bottom /li liServices (like Antivirus) /li liMenu-bar applications/li /ul  <answer66502> h2Applications and Menu Bar items/h2  Most of these can be easily configured in:br emSystem Preferences &#x2192; Users&amp;Groups &#x2192; strongLogin Items/em/strong  h2LaunchAgents and LaunchDaemons/h2  Some applications are cannot be configured in the emSystem Preferences/em (e.g. Sophos AV Scanner, HandsOff Firewall,...) It's best to configure them in their own application to assure that everything runs as designed and intended.  You can look for related strongLaunchAgents/strong and strongLaunchDaemons/strong in:  precode~/Library/LaunchAgents               ~/Library/LaunchDaemons /Library/LaunchAgents                /Library/LaunchDaemons /System/Library/LaunchAgents         /System/Library/LaunchDaemons /code/pre  h2Startup Items/h2  After I installed the multi-boot utility rEFIt, it copied a file coderEFItBlesser/code which is run at startup. Items that run at startup can be found in the following locations:  precode~/Library/Startup Items /Library/Startup Items /code/pre  <comment78236> What do you mean by "too many AV scanners"? It's advised to only use one AV live scanner at a time. However, it's fine to have several on-demand AV scanners. <comment78248> Basically, this is a great introduction, but the full answer is to learn all of launchd and make sure all the legacy launchers that [launchd replaced](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launchd) but that software can bundle and activate like cron, rc.d and such... <comment78249> @bmike Yes, I still got a lot to learn :) This is just as much as I can help. If anybody wants to elaborate certain parts, we can make this answer a wiki post. <comment78250> I like it. The question is about where do things get started and to a first approximation, launchd and startup items preference pane is the answer. I wouldn't change anything here. I'll consider adding a contrasting answer later - how to test the idea that too much running is the cause of slowness by safe booting or running the OS installer to an external drive and A/B testing. For most, that is much more time-efficient than actually learning the guts of how launchd works. Having both will help more people that have similar issues. <comment78256> I suspect that many AV scanners are working at the same time.  I see Clam AV, and many others.  @gentmatt What singluar scanner is best (paid or non paid) <comment78259> I found ClamAV in addition to Sophos in ~\Library\LaunchAgents  I uninstalled ClamAV by dragging the application to the trash, but the .pslist file didn't get removed so I manually removed it.  Was this a correct action to take? <comment78260> I can't say because I've not yet seen any thorough comparison of AV scanners in OSX. I myself use Sophos because it offers live scanning and scheduled scanning of certain parts of the drive - for free. <comment78262> @makerofthings7 That's interesting because I don't have anything related to SophosAV in `~/Library/LaunchAgents`. However I do have a file `/Library/LaunchAgents/com.sophos.uiserver.plist`. If you have uninstalled ClamAV there is no problem to remove the `.plist` as well. <comment93238> Looking ahead: [App Store apps that comply](http://i.stack.imgur.com/wlo0w.png) with sandboxing guidelines may no longer appear in the Users & Groups pane of System Preferences. <comment93274> @GrahamPerrin Do you mean, as 'Login Items`? <comment93303> @gentmatt yes (there's *Login Items* in the linked screenshot … although the shot is **not** of System Preferences – sorry for any confusion). <comment313924> @gentmatt Thanks for the locations info in the answers but would be nice to know how to remove these applications. Spotify places its thing there -com.spotify.webhelper.plist . Is it ok to just remove it as rm -rf com.spotify.webhelper.plist ?
