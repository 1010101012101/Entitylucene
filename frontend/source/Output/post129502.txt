Make F8 work as F8 on MacBook Pro <body> I would like to make F8 key on my MacBook Pro to work as an F8 key, not Play/Pause key, without having to press codefn/code key at the same button.  How do I configure Mac OS X (Mavericks) to work that way?  <answer129503> This function can be set up by going to System Preferences → Keyboard → Keyboard and enabling Use all F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WU04Q.png" width="438"  <answer129504> You can use strongFunctionFlip/strong which can 'flip' certain function keys instead of changing all keys.     FunctionFlip individually controls your MacBook or MacBook Pro's function keys, turning special keys back to regular F-keys, or vice-versa.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rRfMP.png" alt="FunctionFlip"     FunctionFlip's purpose is simply to disable the special features — rewind, play, mute, etc. — on the function keys. For example, if you "flip" F7, F8, and F9, those keys — only those keys — will revert back to normal F keys. Press the fn key with the special key to get the special function back. That is, the "special" and "normal" functions are flipped.   hr  You can also use strongKeyRemap4MacBook/strong with a private.xml such as this:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;   &lt;item&gt;     &lt;name&gt;F8 as Function&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;identifier&gt;F8asFunction&lt;/identifier&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::VK_CONSUMERKEY_MUSIC_PLAY, KeyCode::F8&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::F4, KeyCode::VK_CONSUMERKEY_MUSIC_PLAY&lt;/autogen&gt;   &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  <comment151564> just the F8 or all of the F keys <comment151565> Either option would be good. <comment151569> Your answer worked except for the terminal (example: `mc`). <comment151578> @REACHUS: Are you sure you posted this command under an answer? ;) Besides, do you have enabled "Terminal - Secure Keyboard Entry"?
