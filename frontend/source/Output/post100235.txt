iPhone 5 non-responsive when ringing <body> I have an iPhone 5 with iOS 6.1.4. No third-party software like apps are installed --- the device is all but fresh from the factory.   The device gets non-responsive sometimes when I get an incoming call (about one call in 20) -- the phone keeps ringing but it's impossible to answer it because the touch screen won't respond. After clicking the lock button (on top of the device) a few times, the call is lost and the device gets back to normal, which makes me think this is an iOS bug and not a hardware problem.   Is there any workaround for this problem?  strongEdit:/strong After using the phone more, I've noticed that the UI may suffer hiccups in many more situations (for instance when texting somebody a message); the phone freezes and becomes unresponsive for a few seconds. This behavior is obviously most annoying when you can't answer incoming calls.  <answer101463> Restarting and resetting the phone seems to have solved the problems. It now works like a charm. It remains to be seen if the problems will resurface; I guess another reset will be neccessary then.   I have no apps installed, so this seems like an iOS 6 issue.  <answer123883> I couldn't ring out or accept incoming calls on new Iphone 5 as it had become unresponsive, there are very few apps installed on phone as it is new. Turned power off and back on and phone works again. Hope problem is not recurring.    <comment117969> Is **all** the screen responseless or just the lower are? <comment117970> @Thecafremo: I have tried pushing every visible UI element when the device has entered non-responsive mode to try to provoke some kind of response from the phone, but to no avail. These elements are all located in the lower area. <comment125064> After upgrading the phone to iOS7, the problem is gone. This further strenghens the case that this is an iOS6 issue. <comment144756> Are you using iOS7? I have not had any problems since upgrading from iOS6.
