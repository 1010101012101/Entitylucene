Mac Mini Server VNC from multiple windows users at once <body> I know I can log one user on from a windows server just not two.  There is a similar question but the answer did not include any specifics on how to do it.  Is there any way to use allow for multiple windows users to log onto a windows server at once?  <comment116399> Do you want the session to be shared, or a separate process (similar to what RDP does)? Also, your question ends with "windows users" logging onto a "windows server". Where does the Mac come into play in that scenario?
