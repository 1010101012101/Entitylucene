Spoof OS X El Capitan's Location Services <body> I was pretty excited about the new spotlight features introduced in Yosemite and El Capitan. Unfortunately those features aren't available in my country (India). In some forums I learned that these features can be made working by changing the Language and Region in System Preferences. But what I have discovered is whenever I try to search something in spotlight, I see a location arrow in menu bar indicating Spotlight is using the location as determined by the system's location service. Even using VPN has no effect on it. I am certain of this because Weather and Maps use the same location service and I don't see any change in the location shown by them.  So, is there a way to spoof/fool the system's inbuilt location service so that it can provide a different location to other apps and I can enjoy the new spotlight features?
