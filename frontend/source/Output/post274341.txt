Use Automator services from the context menu (right click) in iTunes? <body> My context menu in iTunes does not offer access to the various Automator services I have created. Is that by design or is something broken? The services are available through the iTunes application menu - Services and work fine that way but it is rather cumbersome to access them there if you use them frequently.  I saw this but as far as I can tell I don't have any plugins for iTunes (unless they are hidden in a really odd place?).  Using an updated version of iTunes.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nPYBT.png" alt="This is how the context menu looks when I right click a track in iTunes" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/faMD5.png" alt="And this is Chrome&#39;s context menu with its service submenu "
