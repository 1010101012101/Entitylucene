Can I disable macOS Sierra's sticky window edges? <body> In macOS Sierra, the window edges are sticky and grab the edges of the display, the top of the Dock and the bottom of the menu bar when being moved around.  This is very useful most of the time, but sometimes I would like to disable it. Whilst it is possible to move the window away from the edge and move it back again which seems to override the sticky edge functionality, I'd like something to prevent the initial grab in the first place.  Is there a way to disable macOS Sierra's sticky window edges?  <answer254228> Hold down option when dragging. Will disable "sticky" edges as needed, when needed, without disabling it all the time by default.  <answer295178> There are a few ways to override the sticky edge:  ul liMove the window faster. There is a speed threshold after which the sticky effect won't take place./li liAfter the edge sticks, simply keep moving in the same direction. The window will unstick. No need to move back and then forward again./li liAs mentioned in the question, move back and forth./li liAs mentioned in another answer, hold the option key while dragging./li /ul  <comment316470> Searching for an answer to this took me to [this blog](https://georgegarside.com/blog/macos/all-the-little-things-macos-sierra-hidden-features/) :-) <comment333003> is there a way to disable it all the time as the default? I never want the sticky behavior. <comment343552> Not that I have seen. It's one of those "live with it or stop using macOS" kind of decisions made by Apple.
