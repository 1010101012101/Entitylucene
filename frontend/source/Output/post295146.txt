Trackpad not working MacBook Pro <body> I am having issue with my trackpad of MacBook Pro Retina early 2015, As it was working properly a day before, the Hardware Keyboard and other things working properly.   I did tried Reseting SMC, PRAM, but no luck, I am on macOS Sierra 10.12.6.  Any suggestions?   <answer295153> Try to get any mouse and go to system preferences by clicking on the apple logo in the top left. Then go to accesability then mouse and track pad. If you have "mouse keys" enabled uncheck it then you should be alright. If this is not the issue and you have tried everything else then you might have a hardware issue.  <answer295163> Try to press firmly on touchpad itself and palm area of the MacBook few times. If after that touchpad will come back to life, then most probably you have problem with the battery. You'll need to replace it in a service center. I had similar problem with my MB.  <answer295166> I would start with the following:  ol liGo to Apple  System Preferences/li liSelect the Trackpad preferences pane/li liCheck your various settings under each of the tabs/li /ol  If nothing there resolves the issue, then try booting into Safe Mode to see whether booting into Safe Mode makes a difference, either during or afterwards.  strongNOTE:/strong Before proceeding below I recommend disconnecting any external devices (e.g. keyboard, mouse, etc). This also includes Bluetooth devices as well as USB.  strongBoot into Safe Mode/strong  Follow these steps to boot your Mac into Safe Mode:  ol liFully shut down your Mac/li liRestart your Mac/li liImmediately press the kbdShift/kbd key and strongkeep it down/strong /li liLet go of the kbdShift/kbd key when you see the login window (NOTE: If you have FileVault enabled you may need to log in twice)./li liTake a note of what happens (i.e. does your trackpad work, etc)/li liExit Safe Mode by restarting your Mac as normal/li liAgain, take a note of what happens (i.e. does your trackpad work, etc)/li /ol  Now, if after you've gone through the above steps you find that:  ul liyour trackpad works during Safe Mode but not when you're logged back in normally, let me know./li liit isn't working during Safe Mode at all, then it's time to test your hardware with Apple Diagnostics (see below)./li /ul  strongRun Apple Diagnostics/strong  Follow the steps below to run Apple Diagnostics:  ol liFully shut down your Mac/li liRestart your Mac/li liImmediately press the kbdD/kbd key and strongkeep it down/strong until you see the Diagnostics screen appear/li liWait for Diagnostics to finish (this typically only takes a few minutes)/li liOnce complete, one of two things will appear on the screen:  ul lia emNo issues found/em message/li lia brief description of any errors found plus further instructions/li /ul/li liIf the diagnostics test does find errors, take a note of what they are/li /ol  strongNote:/strong If pressing and holding the kbdD/kbd key at Step 3 doesn't work, start again at Step 1 and, at Step 3 press and hold both the kbdOption/kbdkbdD/kbd keys instead. This will try and run diagnostics from the internet instead, so you will need to allow more time for it to complete.   Regardless, take a note of what happens and let me know how you went.  <comment372549> tried every thing possible ! <comment372575> An excellent triage sequence. I might suggest adding an “isolate all pointing devices” step before doing safe boot, etc... https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/295164/really-strange-behaviour-on-trackpad-keyboard <comment372576> Please ignore the “ask a new question advice” above. An edit to explain precisely what has failed and a flag to review the close is better if the question at hand is not a duplicate.
