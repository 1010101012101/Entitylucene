saving / restoring the NVRAM <body> I need to find a reliable way to save and restore the contents of NVRAM.  Would this be correct?  Preservation  precodenvram -x -p &gt; ~/nvram.xml /code/pre  Recovery:  precodesudo nvram -x -f ~/nvram.xml /code/pre  <comment344433> In reading the man page for `nvram(8)`, the `-f filename` _option_ states, "_Set firmware variables from a text file. The file must be a list of "name value" statements. The first space on each line is taken to be the separator between "name" and "value". If the last character of a line is \, the value extends to the next line._" and by my interpretation an XML file does not conform to those specifications, whereas a straight dump (just using the `-p` _option_) to a file does. I'd read the man page (in Terminal `man nvram`). Since I haven't tested this, I'm posting as a comment vs. an answer. <comment344434> Also note it states "_Changes to NVRAM variables are only saved by clean restart or shutdown._", so keep that in mind when restoring.
