Finder sidebar icons gone <body> After a reboot caused by an empty battery, my Finder’s sidebar icons are just gone. I tried a few reboots, re-launching Finder, but I can’t fix it.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oNK9L.jpg" alt="Finder Sidebar"  <answer108772> Try resetting Finder by running the following Terminal command:  precoderm ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist &amp;&amp; killall Finder /code/pre  This will reset all Finder preferences back to default.  <answer108831> I just install Mavericks and that's fixed.  <comment127443> I did it and reboot, doesn't work. <comment303252> It did work for me to Reset Finder Settings.
