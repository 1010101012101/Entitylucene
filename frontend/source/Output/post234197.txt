Why doesn't pbpaste return cursor at new line in bash? <body> I run the command codepbpaste/code in Terminal (bash) to get the result of my clipboard, but unlike other commands which leave the cursor at a new line below the previous stdout, codepbpaste/code leaves it to the right of it, as in the example, showing the command sandwiched between two codeecho hello/codes:  precodehostname:~ jesse$ echo hello hello hostname:~ jesse$ pbpaste https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/noizio/id928871589?mt=12hostname:~ jesse$ echo hello hello hostname:~ jesse$  /code/pre  Why is it like this? It seems very odd and makes it difficult to read.  <answer234199> pbpaste pastes exactly what you copy.  In your case you have copied the line not including the CR/LF at the end. To get the return you need to copy from the start of the line to the beginning of the next line  From @patrix comment  Most commands do end with a CR/LF. e.g. codeecho "Hello"/code will put out a newline, however for echo this can be changed codeecho -n "Hello"/code.  If you want you can add a newline after a pbpaste by using codeecho "$(pbpaste)"/code instead.  <answer234205> This doesn't directly answer your question about pbpaste specifically, but I'm a user of zsh (with oh-my-zsh) and it handles the scenario you describe with the outcome you want for any terminal output.    precode➜  ~ echo -n hello hello%                                                                           ➜  ~ ➜  ~ ➜  ~ /bin/bash bash-3.2$ echo -n hello hellobash-3.2$ /code/pre  I realize it's embringing out the bazooka to kill a mosquito/em, but it solves your real problem where lack of a new line on what you pasted isn't handled gracefully.  <comment286313> What exactly did you copy? <comment286314> @Mark The characters in the string on line 4 of my code before "hostname" <comment286316> So what you're also saying is that almost all other commands with output include a terminating newline? <comment286322> @JesseJackson Not directly. `pbpaste` outputs whatever is in the clipboard, which usually doesn't contain a newline. `echo some text` adds a newline by default, but that's something that you can prevent from happening with `echo -n some text`. If you want to ensure a newline after `pbpaste`, use `echo $(pbpaste)` instead. <comment286332> Nice info, even if it is not relevant. <comment286333> @patrix Which other commands don't include a newline by default? I've never seen this behavior in bash before using the pbpaste command. <comment286334> @JesseJackson not many but pbpaste is copying that it gets which is need for uses where it is substituted in the middle of a command. As I noted cut and paste usually for me cuts the newline as I copy to the beginning of the line. Also see questions on python without readline <comment286337> @JesseJackson The difference is between commands intended to *output* some text in Terminal (like `echo`, `ls` etc.) and commands intended to *return* text/data from somewhere. The former add a newline automatically, the later just return (print) whatever they got (which in case of the clipboard may or may be without a newline).
