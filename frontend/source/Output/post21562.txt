Installing Imagemagick leads to weird error involving OpenCL <body> I'm trying to install ImageMagick on Mac OSX 10.7 and I'm getting the following errors:  When I try to run the suggested verification  precode$ convert logo: logo.gif dyld: Library not loaded: /System/Library/Frameworks/OpenCL.framework/Versions/A/Libraries/libclparser.dylib Referenced from: /opt/local/bin/convert Reason: image not found Trace/BPT trap: 5  $ identify logo.gif dyld: Library not loaded: /System/Library/Frameworks/OpenCL.framework/Versions/A/Libraries/libclparser.dylib Referenced from: /opt/local/bin/identify Reason: image not found Trace/BPT trap: 5 /code/pre  When I try pretty much anything...  precode$ identify -version dyld: Library not loaded: /System/Library/Frameworks/OpenCL.framework/Versions/A/Libraries/libclparser.dylib Referenced from: /opt/local/bin/identify Reason: image not found Trace/BPT trap: 5 /code/pre  I've followed the path and it looks like the libclparser.dylib is missing from the OpenCL.framework, but I'm unsure of where to find that or how to replace it, or even if that's the right thing to do.  <answer21563> Here's what I did to fix this.  ol liBooted up my old machine running OSX 10.6./li liCopied /System/Library/Frameworks/OpenCL.framework/Versions/A/Libraries/libclparser.dylib from 10.6 computer into the same folder on 10.7./li /ol  Now things seem to be working fine.  strongNote/strong: the file can also be found here:   <answer96825> If you're using Homebrew, try the following command:  precodebrew doctor /code/pre  to diagnose the common problems.  One of it could be to remove DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH variable from your ~/.profile if you have it.  Or you have to re-install libtool by:  precodebrew reinstall libtool --universal &amp;&amp; brew unlink libtool &amp;&amp; brew link libtool /code/pre  <answer97314> The top-voted answer on https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6764176/lion-10-7-not-supporting-convert1-dylib-error (minus the first two steps) worked for me â€” so basically just  ol licodebrew uninstall imagemagick/code/li licodebrew update/code/li licodebrew install imagemagick/code/li li(optionally) codebrew doctor/code and follow the instructions/li /ol  I did have to manually delete some files, but codebrew doctor/code tells you which ones. The order of uninstall, update, install, doctor probably isn't important.  <comment23701> How is installing a library not programing related? Maybe this should be migrated to apple.stachexchange.com? <comment23702> Or SuperUser ... it shouldn't have been just closed. <comment23703> Great, that worked for me too!  Thanks for posting it. <comment40389> I copied my old file from a backup but it bummed out. The download link worked a treat. Thanks! <comment41267> Thank you for addressing to my answer <comment106165> Can someone please re-upload ? The link is broke :( <comment114223> brew doctor checks things are OK so do first
