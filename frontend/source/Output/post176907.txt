Add Folder to Spotlight Index in Yosemite <body> I found a link somewhere that uses codemdimport -f/code command, however, when using it on the command line, I got the message that says     warning, the -f option has been obsoleted, and does nothing.   So, how can I add a custom path into spotlight index in Yosemite (10.10)  <comment209042> Mavericks is 10.9. Are you using 10.9 or 10.10 (Yosemite)? <comment209051> Sorry, I mean Yosemite @tubedogg
