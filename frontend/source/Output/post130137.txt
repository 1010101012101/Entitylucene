How to add a timestamp in log files on launchd? <body> In launchd, you can change the path of the log files using codeStandardOutPath/code and codeStandardErrorPath/code in .plist file, but when I used it to output a log returned by the process, the resultant log files didn't add a timestamp and hence I cannot tell when each line is written nor when the process is run to begin with.  So is it feasible to add the timestamp information to the log files? The minimum requirement is month, day, hour, minute, and second.  <answer130145> The keys you mention don't redirect log files, they redirect the standard output/error streams. It is the responsibility of the program writing to those streams to add timestamp information.  <answer146504> You could include the codedate/code command in ProgramArguments before your program path in your launchd .plist:  code&lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt; &lt;array&gt;     &lt;string&gt;/bin/bash&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;string&gt;-c&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;string&gt;date; program-path-here&lt;/string&gt; &lt;/array&gt;/code  It's the equivalent of running code/bin/bash -c "date; program-path-here"/code  <comment172633> the log output does not necessarily read an environment variable - and also this is one time for the whole file - and the OP wants different times on each line
