Windows 8.1 Won't Update-Continues to Recover/Refresh <body> I have a late 2015 4k iMac with a 1TB fusion drive and I have been trying to install windows 8.1 on it via bootcamp. My issue with this installation is either the install will not allow internet access at all, or that the installation of windows 8.1 will not update. If I try to do security updates etc via Windows Update, Windows will attempt to restart and will not be able to, thus making me have to reset the system to an earlier checkpoint and removing all the work I just did.   I would appreciate any advice regarding how to get Windows 8.1 to first install fully to my iMac and then how to update etc without it completely resetting the install. Thank you!  <comment279542> Did you install the bootcamp drivers?
