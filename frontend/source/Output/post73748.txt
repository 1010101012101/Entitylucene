Can't connect my Mac Pro4 to a Wifi <body> I've always had an Ethernet cable to connect to, until now. There is a wireless Internet signal at my location but I think this computer may not have the hardware to connect? I don't see the antenna icon that would normally appear in the bar at the top on Wifi equipped machines.   strongWhat do I need to purchase for this computer so it can connect to a wifi?/strong  <answer73749> You could go for a USB Wireless Adapter Amazon search, Google search  You could also go for a PCI wireless card.  You could also go for the Airport Extreme card.  I believe the model you need is codeMB988ZM/A/code  <answer73819> To see if your Mac Pro4 has a wifi device installed, go to System Preferences  Network and see if Wi-Fi appears in the list of connection types:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AW7PK.png" alt="Connection types list"  If you emdo/em have a wifi device installed, you can turn on its menu bar icon by clicking this checkbox:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ieJ2f.png" alt="enter image description here"
