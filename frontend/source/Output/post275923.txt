IDVD widescreen preview problem. I want 4:3 <body> I want to burn my movie but when i preview it in idvd i get the widescreen preview .If i burn it , it becomes widescreen. I select 4:3 when i start my idvd project and in project info. it automatically converts to widescreen, why?  I tried all different types of movie clips, they are normal and viewed in 4:3  How can i fix this issue i want 4:3.  all help is much appreciated   <comment347217> Could you clarify: Was the project always in 4:3? Or, was it originally in 16:9 and then you've changed it to 4:3? Or, are you saying this is a problem you're having with _all_ projects? Finally, can you confirm what version of iDVD you're using?
