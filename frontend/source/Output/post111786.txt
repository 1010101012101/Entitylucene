\u2018 includes a whitespace character under Mac OS X <body> Regardless of whether I use the GNU version of printf--and regardless of whether I'm using the code\u2018/code escape sequence in codeprintf/code or in nodejs's codeconsole.log/code--the unicode character codeâ€˜/code is always interpreted as the character with a space following it.  Any ideas on how to get this behavior to stop?    <answer111787> As it turns out the problem was an option that I had set in iTerm2.  When you have the following option set for your iTerm2 profile, code\u2018/code is interpreted as an ambiguous-width char and so is considered to be double-width, but since it isn't an double-width character, such as a kanji, a space gets appended to it.    Just make sure that you have the following option unchecked:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LYbvn.png" alt="enter image description here"
