I have a MacBook Air mid 2011, with:  ul liBluetooth Version 4.3 /li liBluetooth Low Energy Supported /li liLMP Version 0x6/li /ul     Does somebody experience the same behaviour?   <answer150936> Nope, it's not supported. You can see the system requirements for using Continuity here:  precodeMacBook Air (Mid 2012 and later) MacBook Pro (Mid 2012 and later) iMac (Late 2012 and later) Mac mini (Late 2012 and later) Mac Pro (Late 2013) /code/pre  <answer150990> Follow this guide, works on the release from yesterday as well, my Macbook Air 2011 is working great.  It's a workaround for sure, and if you are not comfortable with editing kext files... Run!  http://forums.macrumors.com/showpost.php?p=20015070&amp;postcount=609  <answer151003> My mid-2011 mb air supports Bluetooth LE and Bluetooth 4, yet apple has prescribed that it shall not support handoff.   The LMP Version required for handoff, 0x6, is also supported.   Why apple decided to not include support for handoff/continuity our mb air models when we have the hardware in place to run it needs further explanation from apple.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UubFg.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/boeWS.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer151443> strongAs of 10/23/2014 The creator of the tutorial below (@dokterdok) has released a software tool to automate the process./strong  Below is from the original macrumors post...

Read the link from the right answer. Everything works fine now. They just didn't include the model from 2011 in their registered files... <comment177996> I can confirm it's working, I had the same "Noes" in BT report.
