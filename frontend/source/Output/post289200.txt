Is it possible to use etc/hosts to block a specific part of a whole website <body> I know how to use etc/hosts to block something such as youtube.com  However, I when I try to use etc/hosts to block something such as: youtube.com/user/TEDtalksDirector  nothing seems to happen. Is it possible to block a specific channel on youtube with etc/hosts instead of the entire site, and if so how is it done?  Here is my etc/hosts file (youtube user is modified):  precode## # Host Database # # localhost is used to configure the loopback interface # when the system is booting.  Do not change this entry. ## 127.0.0.1       localhost 255.255.255.255 broadcasthost ::1             localhost fe80::1%lo0     localhost # 127.0.0.1       www.youtube.com/user/TEDtalksDirector /code/pre  <answer289205> No. You need a web proxy or other filter product that snoops on and processes the URL instead of just the main host.   <comment365315> No: [How to block URL with parameter in Windows hosts file](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32607694/how-to-block-url-with-parameter-in-windows-hosts-file) & [Uniform Resource Identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier#Syntax) - please check the example. The hosts file can only "manipulate" the *host* part of an URL by translating it to different IP-address.
