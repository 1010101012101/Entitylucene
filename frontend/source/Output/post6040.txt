Entourage MyDay replacement <body> I am migrating from Entourage to Mac Mail. Entourage has a tool called MyDay which is quite handy for getting an overview over my appointments first day in the morning.  Is there a competitive product available which snycronizes with iCal appointments and todo list?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/J9VPg.jpg" alt="alt text"  <answer6062> This software, iDeskCal might do it. It gives you access to iCal on your desktop, but it's unclear to me if it supports to-dos.  <answer9726> I think I found one app which could do the job on the app store, it's called "Today - Daily Calendar &amp; Task Manager"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gdo3v.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment6401> The problem with this application is that my desktop is cluttered with folders and Files, so I wont be able to see iDeskCal
