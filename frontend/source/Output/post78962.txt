How to download contacts from iPhone to Mac? <body> I was able to do a backup of the phone using iTunes, but how do I see and access the contacts?  Do I need to import them into Address Book?  Is there a better way to download contacts from iPhone to Mac?  <answer78974> The best solution *IS* iCloud sync.   Simple and without any fuss   But a simple syncing over USB or Wifi to iTunes should ask you if you want to merge your contacts when contacts syncing is enabled (iTunesiPhoneInfoSync Contacts)   <answer78975> The best way is to use the Apple supplied sync options - either over USB/WiFi local sync to the Contacts app (Address Book on Lion and earlier) using iTunes or using iCloud.  From there, you can backup / export them as vCard or inject them into Exchange, LDAP or other services. This way the contacts are in a standard / text format as opposed to the internal storage form for iOS or OS X contacts app.  To get started in syncing Contacts between iTunes and an iOS device, get your USB cable and open iTunes. From there - type strongsync contacts/strong into the help menu search field and iTunes help will walk you through the setup. With a few clicks, you should be at a window like this and can turn on the sync for that device.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/q6KyR.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment91274> Is there are a reason [iCloud](https://www.apple.com/icloud/features/calendar-contacts-mail.html) contact syncing wouldn't work? That seems like a "better way" to download contacts from iPhone to Mac. <comment91341> That's what I am trying to figure out. How to "local sync to the Contacts app (Address Book on Lion and earlier) using iTunes".
