installing old version of c++ compiler <body> I use codeOSX 10.10.5/code need to compile some codec++/code code with an old version of codegcc/code, namely code4.3.4/code. I don't think codeXCode/code provide that kind of tools. I suppose there is a way to do that by hand. How can I do that ?   <answer205577> I have compiled older gcc in the past as a last resort.   ol liGet Xcode - it gives you clang and lots of header files. If you can't stomach it, get the command line tools. /li liGet http://brew.sh /li licodebrew install gcc/code/li /ol  From there you can see if an older gcc is available or worst case, pull that source and compile it from the version of gcc you have running from above. It looks like you'll be able to use homebrew to get at the version 4.3 from the versioned source already in the tool:  precodemac:~ me$ brew search gcc gcc homebrew/dupes/apple-gcc42       homebrew/versions/gcc44          homebrew/versions/gcc47          homebrew/versions/gcc5 homebrew/head-only/gccxml        homebrew/versions/gcc45          homebrew/versions/gcc48          homebrew/versions/llvm-gcc28 homebrew/versions/gcc43          homebrew/versions/gcc46          homebrew/versions/gcc49 /code/pre  <comment247876> Welcome to Ask Different. Are you going to make us guess your OS X version and the old gcc version you need? <comment247881> @bmike I did not think it was `OS` specific. I have just updated my post <comment247883> I have already tried `homebrew/versions/gcc43 ` and I get this message : ` OS X Mavericks or older is required.` <comment247884> @Newben Did you find the source of that message and look at the code? You could probably comment out the check and see what breaks. Or you'll need to just get the source and start fixing compile errors. That's the "last resort" I mentioned above. <comment247885> next time - Consider helping us help you.
