Page up/page down not working in browser view in aperture <body> Recently page up/page down keys on my keyboard no longer scroll the browser window in Aperture.  They do work in chrome.  This rules out a coffee spill or other cause that would result in mechanical problems.  I have checked the customize keyboard.  Arrow keys are still defined to be page up/page down.  Other keys still work:  E.g. End goes to last image.    hr  Ok.  Switched to another project.  Page keys work.  Switched back.  Page keys work.  Bizarre.  Likely bumped some key that changed state, but what?  What am I missing?
