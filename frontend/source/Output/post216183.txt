Yosemite-Remove string of numbers with Automator <body> I'm exporting various mov files from Davinci Resolve and they all have a string of numbers after them. I've aded a "-" to the custom filename so they're easier to select, but I want to remove them in a less labour intensive way.  Ex. "Rob's_Birthday-0018936.mov"  How do I tell Automator to remove the dash and string of numbers but keep ".mov" suffix?
