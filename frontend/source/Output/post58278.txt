Add attachments to Calendar <body> Is it possible to add attachments (like photos) to Calendar events?  For example, I gathered the flyer of an event I want to attend. It is far in September, and having added the event to remember about it, I'd like to attach the picture I've taken of said flyer.  I don't know if the problem is the Italian version of Calendar, but I can't find the "Add Attachment" link - it is missing while editing.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MXIbL.png" height="400"  <answer58281> Yes, just click on "Add Attachement" in the Calendar Entry Detail.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xarP0.png" height="400" title="Add attachment to Calendar appointment"  <answer58333> Check this. It appears that attachments can be added to local calendars only. It may also be possible with calendars synced with remote servers, if the server supports it (but that's just a speculation, I don't know if such servers exist)  <comment67005> Hmm.. I don't see it in Calendar for Mountain Lion... <comment67006> @pistacchio, it's there though. Did you click "Edit"? <comment67068> Mine are google-calendar synced. This must be the problem :/ <comment67078> Try to create a local calendar; if you can add attachment to it, then that's the problem indeed.
