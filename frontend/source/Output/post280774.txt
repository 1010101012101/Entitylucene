How to connect to specific Tmux session using Iterm2 <body> I recently learned that I can use iTerm as tmux's window management system (https://gitlab.com/gnachman/iterm2/wikis/TmuxIntegration) by calling tmux -CC, and attaching to an existing session by calling tmux -CC attach. How do I specify which tmux instance to attach to?
