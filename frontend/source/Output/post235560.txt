iOS App with Free trial and subscribe after that <body> So we have an app under codeHealth &amp; Fitness/code category. The app is based on only one main functionality and no other sub functionalities. Now, the client would want to give users some free trial period like 7 days and if the user likes the app they can subscribe to continue using the app, if they choose not to subscribe they will not be able to use the app any further. So, I have done some research and came up with this result:  strongOption 1: Lite version/Paid version/strong  Obviously I don't see any hope that this would work for us. Since we cannot split the main functionality.  strongOption 2: In-App Purchase/strong  emRelated : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28396357/ios-trial-app-without-in-app-purchase-mechanism/em   From App Store Review Guidelines  ul li11.8 Apps that use IAP to purchase access to built-in capabilities provided by iOS, watchOS, and tvOS, such as the camera or the gyroscope, or Apple-branded peripherals, such as Apple Pencil or Apple Keyboard, or Apple services, such as Apple Music access or iCloud storage, will be rejected/li li11.9 Apps containing content or services that expire after a limited time will be rejected, except for specific approved content (e.g. films, television programs, music, books)/li /ul  As far as I understood, it states that Apps under codeMagazine &amp; Newspapers/code category alone utilize this exception. Is that correct? And it states we should not block the entire activity of the app instead we should limit the usage, is that correct?  Any help is much appreciated.
