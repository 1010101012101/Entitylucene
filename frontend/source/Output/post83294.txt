How to add localised holidays to iCal <body> How can I add a localised holiday calendar to iCal? I would like to add all public holidays to iCal/iCloud, how to best do this?  (Personally I'm after the Norwegian and Australian Holidays, but I'm after a general answer.)  <answer83295> Apple has many calendars you can add: http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/calendars/  <answer83377> update of the calendar files are not easy to find, however as indicated here, microsoft released a new holiday patch in july2012 for holidays up to 2022 (here).  Given a minimal editing it could be converted to ical and then imported.  For instance for Norway one would need to write following for the first 2 instances of Ascension (for more dtails on the syntax:RFC5545)  precodeBEGIN:VCALENDAR VERSION:2.0 PRODID:pyICSParser BEGIN:VEVENT UID:Ascension2012 DTSTART;VALUE=DATE:20120517 SUMMARY:Ascension END:VEVENT BEGIN:VEVENT UID:Ascension2013 DTSTART;VALUE=DATE:20120509 SUMMARY:Ascension END:VEVENT END:VCALENDAR /code/pre  <comment95913> Looks like they haven't been updated in 3 years. <comment95977> Can you describe the required editing for other users? <comment95979> just done so with example ical file <comment96014> The list may not be updated, but the calendars are fine. I have two country holiday calendars and they're always correct. <comment96019> May be because they follow the Gregorian calendar. Holidays for my country aren't updated.
