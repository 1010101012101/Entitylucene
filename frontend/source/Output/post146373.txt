Wiktionary in Apple Dictionary app <body> I have been trying to add wiktionary as one of the sources of Mavericks Dictionary.app but I could not. I have been following the instruction in this StackExchange post but the DictUnifier app get stuck indexing the content. Or at least it takes forever.... I leave the program the whole night (more than 10 hours in that situation) and nothing happened.   Does anyone know where I can get a wiktionary version ready to use in dictionary.app on mac?   <answer146376> Apple has changed quite a lot in their new OSX version. And as you see on the DictUnifier-website, the tool only was updated to support Lion in the newest version.      Support Mac OS X 10.7 "Lion"   So Mavericks isn't supported at all, which I think is the root of the problem.  <comment172485> Are you telling me that if I was Lion user I would be able to do the transformation? That is pretty sad. <comment172486> At least that's what I interpret from the owners website. <comment172515> Well, most of the times if it can run on Lion, it can run on Mavericks... <comment172529> Not all the time like you see it here.
