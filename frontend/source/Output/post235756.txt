MacBook Pro (2006, A1150) fails to boot <body> My MacBook Pro (2006, model A1150) fails to boot beyond the white screen AFTER the screen with the Apple logo and spinner.  I have tried:br Resetting PRAM     (doesn't work)br Resetting SMC     (how can you tell?)br Apple Hardware Test     (says no problems)br Swapping RAM chips with a similar machine     (no effect)br Re-installing OS 10.6.3.     (Seems to be O.K.)br Booting in "Verbose Mode"     (Stops at code"Unable to read Block 16 17 18 19"/code etc)br  Booting in "Target mode"     (this works!)br Booting in "Safe mode"     (this works too!)br  What is preventing it from booting, and how can I resolve this matter?  <answer235778> When you re-installed the OS, did you erase or repartition the hard drive? The Apple hardware test never found a hardware problem I had with my MacPro so it is not necessarily comprehensive.   The Verbose message sounds like a "can't read the hard drive at block...." message. Which would mean a damaged hard drive.   There appears to be some part of the OS that is stored on the hard drive at a particular place that can't be read at boot time. This part appears to be bypassed in safe mode and target mode.  Good luck!  <comment288885> Thanks for that.  Yes, I did indeed erase the HD before installation.
