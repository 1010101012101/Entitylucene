Remove rogue keyboard shortcut in OSX <body> I recently followed this blog to add a keyboard shortcut to lock the screen:  http://hpmalte.blogspot.ca/2012/01/keyboard-shortcut-to-lock-screen-in-os.html  I assigned the kbdcommand/kbdkbdL/kbd keyboard shortcut to this script. I recently discovered the built-in kbdctrl/kbdkbdshift/kbdkbdeject/kbd, which is better.  Now I'm trying to remove the kbdcommand/kbdkbdL/kbd shortcut, but it has disappeared from my keyboard shortcuts preferences! The keybinding still works, but it's not listed in keyboard shortcuts, and I do not know how to remove it now.  Does anyone know how? Thanks!  <answer68939> The Service should have been saved in code~/Library/Services/code (code~/code means your home directory), so have a look for the file there. Deleting it should remove the functionality (although it should be showing up in the Services section of Keyboard Shortcuts â€” check to make sure it's not in a collapsed section).  <comment80109> I've tried looking there and in the Services folder I have a few other automator workflows but not this one. It seems to have completely disappeared, but the CMD-L keybinding still does that suspension thing. I want to disable it so that, for example, in Chrome, I can keep the Chrome CMD-L binding. <comment80110> It's possible it got moved somewhere else (although I don't know why). Open Terminal and run `mdfind -name .service` and see if it turns up anything that looks right.
