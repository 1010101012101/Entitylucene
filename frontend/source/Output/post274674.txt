An Applescript that batch-copies the Song tag to the Movement tag <body> I have a rather large iTunes library (~300GB) that is mainly classical music. I really like the Work and Movement format, but sadly it is not practical to manually update my metadata to the Work and Movement format. Almost all of the extisting song tags are in the following format:  precodeTelemann - Concerto in E minor: I. Andante II. Allegro III. Largo IV. Allegro etc. /code/pre  A script that could automate updating the tagging system would look like the following.  ol liOn all selected songs, copy the Song tag to the Movement tag/li liDelete the roman numeral, period and space from the front of the Movement tag. Or, on the format where the entire work name in included in the Song tag, delete that./li /ol  Any help or pointers for actually implementing this script would be very helpful. I have looked at and used Doug's Work and Movement scripts, but they don't cover the matching process that would be needed to delete the roman numerals from the start.  strongEDIT/strong  It has become apparent that many of the tags are not in the above format, but in a format like below:  precodeSerenade for strings in C major, Op. 48 - I. Allegro Serenade for strings in C major, Op. 48 - II. Adagio Serenade for strings in C major, Op. 48 - III. Allegro moderato etc. /code/pre  OR in the same format as above except using arabic numerals in the place of the roman numerals.  The script should result in the "Movement" tags having the following outputs:  precodeAllegro Adagio Allegro moderato /code/pre  The idea is I would get the first part of this ("Serenade for strings in C major, Op. 48") and copy it to the "work" tag, which I have already implemented, then get the remaining text, remove the movement numbers, and assign it to the Movement tag. Any help on implementing a system that would do this would be appreciated.   Here is the script in its current form. It is based on Doug's Name to Work script.  precodetell application "iTunes"     set sel to selection of front browser window     if sel is {} then         try             display dialog "Nothing is selected…" buttons {"Quit"} with icon 0         end try         return     end if      set c to (count of sel)     set songName to (get name of item 1 of sel)       set userOptions to display dialog "Edit for Work name and then click OK." default answer songName --prompt for work name      repeat with i from 1 to c --set the movement numbers         set thisTrack to item i of sel         try             set work of thisTrack to text returned of userOptions             set movement number of thisTrack to i             set movement count of thisTrack to c             set movement of thisTrack to my delRomNum(name of thisTrack) -- copy movement text from song name and delete roman numerals         end try     end repeat   end tell  on delRomNum(t) -- the perl command search and delete any roman numeral (must be a word followed by the period and a space character)     do shell script "/usr/bin/perl -pe 's/\\b[IVXLCDM]+\\b. //g' &lt;&lt;&lt; " &amp; quoted form of t end delRomNum /code/pre  <answer274764> To delete the roman numerals, you can use the codedelRomNum()/code handler from this script:  precode--- this text as an example. set movementText to "Telemann - Concerto in E minor: I. Andante II. Allegro III. Largo IV. Allegro etc."  set movementText to my delRomNum(movementText) -- delete roman numerals   on delRomNum(t) -- the perl command search and delete any roman numeral (must be a word followed by the period and a space character)     do shell script "/usr/bin/perl -pe 's/\\b[IVXLCDM]+\\b. //g' &lt;&lt;&lt; " &amp; quoted form of t end delRomNum /code/pre  The result of the script is    precode"Telemann - Concerto in E minor: Andante Allegro Largo Allegro etc." /code/pre   hr  strongUpdate:/strong  If I understood correctly :  From each line in a string, the command must delete the characters    from the beginning of the line through the first occurrence of (a    roman numeral or an arabic numeral) followed by the period and a    space character, so use this handler:  precode-- call it, like this --&gt; set movement of thisTrack to my delRomNum(name of thisTrack) on delRomNum(t)     (***  from  the contents of the 't' variable (the end of lines must be an Unix Line Endings), so the 'tr' command change the carriage returns (Mac Line Endings) to linefeed (Unix Line Endings)     the 'perl' command delete the first character in each line through the first occurrence of a word  which contains (a roman numeral or a number) followed by the period and a space character ***)     do shell script "tr '\\r' '\\n' &lt;&lt;&lt; " &amp; (quoted form of t) &amp; " | /usr/bin/perl -pe 's/^.*?\\b[IVXLCDM0-9]+\\b. //g'" end delRomNum /code/pre  Example: the script pass this string to the handler as parameter  precodeSerenade for strings in C major, Op. 48 - I. Allegro Serenade for strings in C major, Op. 48 - II. Adagio Serenade for strings in C major, Op. 48 - III. Allegro moderato Serenade for strings in C major, Op. 48 - 4.

Allegro Ma Non Tanto 9. Largo Adagio etc. /code/pre  The handler returns:  precodeAllegro Adagio Allegro moderato Allegro  Molto Appassionato Adagio - Allegro Molto Allegro moderato Adagio - Allegro Non Troppo Allegro Ma Non Tanto Largo Adagio etc. /code/pre  <answer274868> Well, I've figured this out myself. In the case that this is helpful to someone else, this is the complete script.  precodetell application "iTunes"     set sel to selection of front browser window     if sel is {} then         try             display dialog "Nothing is selected…" buttons {"Quit"} with icon 0         end try         return     end if      set c to (count of sel)     set songName to (get name of item 1 of sel)       set workName to display dialog "Edit for Work name and then click OK." default answer songName --prompt for work name     set movementLength to display dialog "Edit to everything except the movement name. Do not include the roman numeral if one is present. If an arabic numeral is present, include it." default answer songName --prompt for movement length       repeat with i from 1 to c --set the movement numbers         set thisTrack to item i of sel         set songName to (get name of thisTrack)         set work of thisTrack to text returned of workName         set movement number of thisTrack to i         set movement count of thisTrack to c         set movement of thisTrack to my delRomNum(text ((length of text returned of movementLength) + 1) thru (length of songName) of songName as string) -- copy movement text from song name and delete roman numerals     end repeat   end tell  on delRomNum(t) -- the perl command search and delete any roman numeral (must be a word followed by the period and a space character)     do shell script "/usr/bin/perl -pe 's/\\b[IVXLCDM]+\\b. //g' &lt;&lt;&lt; " &amp; quoted form of t end delRomNum /code/pre  <comment345433> @jackjr300 You might be able to help? Take this as a complement. <comment345434> @kopischke You might be able to help too. Let me know if you can :) I'm pinging the "experts" at AppleScripting. <comment345591> This works really well, thanks so much. I really don't know what I am doing and actually added a section to the question and my current script, if you could take a look and give me any pointers then that would be extraordinarily useful. Thanks again. <comment345596> Please edit your "EDIT" and show the expected output you're looking to assign to the Movement tag from "_It has become apparent that many of the tags are not in the above format, but in a format like below:_" because the output you want is not obvious. <comment345597> @user3439894 Done. Thanks for pointing out the unclarity (is that a word?) <comment345688> see my updated answer.
