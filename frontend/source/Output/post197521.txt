How to split screen in TotalTerminal to end up with two terminals? <body> Often when you have codessh/code'ed into a server, you could like a second terminal to continue right off there, without having to codessh/code again.  I know that iTerm2 can do it, but it feels buggy on multi screens.  TotalTerminal makes a solid impression but seems to lack that feature, unless I have overlooked it.  Is there a way to split the terminal horizontally or vertically and have two independent terminals working off the same place?  <answer197522> The way I achieve this is ensuring that codetmux/code is installed on the machine I'm SSHing to.  Once you've issues codetmux/code you can do codectrl-b %/code to split the screen vertically, or codectrl-b "/code to split it horizontally.   This will give you two sessions within the same terminal window, and can also be persistent across logins. This may not be exactly what you want though.   <answer219078> Mentioning TotalTerminal—which doesn't have a split-pane feature—may be too specific. You just want to know if there's a solution for Terminal, right?  It would help if you elaborated on what you mean by “continue right off there” and “without having to codessh/code again.”  If you create a terminal using strongShell  New Remote Connection…/strong or strongShell  New Command…/strong to run codessh/code, Terminal’s strongShell  New Window/Tab with Same Command/strong commands can create a new terminal and run the same command within it automatically.  <comment264991> And, starting in OS X 10.11 El Capitan, Terminal supports Mouse Reporting, so you can enable mouse support in `tmux` and use the mouse to resize and manipulate tmux panes. <comment264992> This sounds like a feature request for Terminal.
