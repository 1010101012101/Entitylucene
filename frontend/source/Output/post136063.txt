Force Mac to display in grayscale <body> Is there a way to force OSX to display in monochrome(also known as grayscale)?  I'm working with a student who has ADHD (and I am mildly ADHD myself).  The colors are too much for him/her to handle.  strongEDIT:/strong Ideally I'm looking to assign a keyboard shortcut or create a desktop icon.  <answer136064> Yes, this can be achieved with AppleScript and Automator.  The setting to automate is located in:  strongSystem Preferences  Accessibility  Display  Use Greyscale/strong  The keyboard combination kbdoption/kbd + kbdcommand/kbd + kbdF5/kbd also shows Accessibility options.  This Apple discussion, Keyboard shortcut for "Use grayscale", shows how to use AppleScript and Automator to create a menu bar item that toggles the Greyscale on/off.  <answer261854> As of Sierra you can strongtell Siri to ‘use grayscale’/strong, the closest thing to a shortcut I’ve been able to discover so far.  <comment161332> Might there be a way to define such to a shortcut?  Maybe keyboard or dock icon? <comment161334> @LiamWilliam In the Accessibility Pane, you can check "Show Accessibility status in the Menu Bar" for easy access to the pane. Also, the keyboard combination OPTION+COMMAND+F5 brings up accessibility controls. <comment341248> The linked script no longer works for macOS Sierra. Might someone post an updated one?
