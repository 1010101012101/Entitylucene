Programmatically Change Screen Saver "Start after" time <body> I would like to change the time before my screen saver starts based on WiFi network. I am running Yosemite (10.10.1). I will use Keyboard Maestro to trigger the action.  I need to find the correct setting or possibly Applescript Library / Dictionary and I can take it from there.This is related to, but not quite the same as askForPasswordDelay. That setting determines how long, after the screen saver starts, before a password is required to entered. I want to change the delay before the screen saver comes on.  I've done a lot of searching and found nothing yet, any help would be greatly appreciated.   <answer166656> I was able to find the following:  precode$defaults -currentHost write com.apple.screensaver idleTime n /code/pre  Where n is number of seconds before screensaver starts (0 = never)  This is exactly what I was looking for. reference: http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20080207030932483
