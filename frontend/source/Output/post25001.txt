How can I forcibly shut down my Mac at an appointed time? <body> I'm looking for an auto shutdown app that will forcefully shut down the computer at an appointed time.  The most important part of this is that the shutdown should not be cancelable (unless the process is extremely onerous).  <answer25004> This can be scheduled in strongSystem Preferences  Energy Saver  Schedule/strong. I'm not certain that this will initiate a forced shutdown, you'd have to try it out. But that's a built in option to automate scheduled power down/up.  ul liYou can also forcibly shutdown the system with a terminal command (requires root):  shutdown -h now  You could put that command into a stronglaunchd/strong or strongcron/strong scheduled task. Check out strongthis article/strong for far more info on those two services./li liYou may also want to check out an application like the aptly named strongiWannaSleep/strong (not sure if this emforces/em shutdown)./li /ul  <answer25270> You can use codeshutdown/code directly to schedule a shutdown at any given time in the future:  precodeshutdown -h time /code/pre  where time specifies  a future time in one of two formats:              +number, or yymmddhhmm, where the year, month, and day may be defaulted to the current              system values.  The first form brings the system down in number minutes and the second              at the absolute time specified.  <answer25273> I'd take a look at this tech note by Apple  <answer25282> Ok, so further to my previous answer, I can walk you through getting cron (a built in UNIX schedule service) to run a scheduled shutdown command for you.  strongIt will run as root and will be forced./strong  ul liOpen Terminal (/Applications/Utilities/Terminal)/li liInput codesudo crontab -e/code/li /ul  strongYou'll need to enter your login password and then press enter./strong  You'll now be in a text editor (vim).

For many applications this is aggressive behaviour and does not provide the application with much opportunity to save state or data.  h2Schedule Assistant/h2  Power Manager includes a Schedule Assistant task for shutting down to a schedule.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QSLCb.jpg" alt="Power Manager - power off daily task"  Disclosure: I work with the company who make Power Manager.  <comment28539> What...??? I'm looking for an app. <comment28540> You may want to appear less ungrateful, but if you reread my answer you'll see that I recommend an app and if you do a little independent research you'll see that there are actually a few more applications that have this ability! <comment28543> iWannaSleep is the first result that people recommend on google, and it doesn't do what I want. And you're recommending me learn some unix thing to shut down the computer? <comment28544> No I am grateful for your help, it's just that your help is completely befuddling. <comment28546> I recommend it because it is an effective way to achieve what you want using built in tools. If you are unable to find an application that suits your needs then you may need to look to something along the lines of my suggestion. <comment28547> Thanks, what do I do now? <comment28548> you can use SendAppleEventToSystemProcess(kAEShutDown) then you can use the command killall -u username to kill all apps (since you don't want it cancelable) you might also want to check out the timer class: http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSTimer_Class/Reference/NSTimer.html <comment28551> Great article, but OP was balking about using cron or launchd, I doubt he's looking to code his own solution to this problem. <comment28552> Don't you need to put `sudo` there? I know that will probably cause it to hang up, but I'm pretty sure you have to be root to run `shutdown`. <comment28554> No exceptions needed, that's an amazing answer, quite happily surprised, especially after I replied to your rudely. Thank you very much for your help <comment28560> @daveisgeek - You are totally right, but note that we startup crontab with sudo. This means that we are editing root's crontab and therefore any scheduled commands within will be executed as that user. <comment28644> Hey, I did this, and at the appointed time I got a dialog that says, this computer will shut down in 10 minutes? And it asks me to cancel. I don't know if that was the result of the cron thing, or the energy saver thing I also did. Is the cron thing supposed to force a shutdown without a cancel dialog? <comment28667> You shouldn't be getting a dialog. Turn off the schedule in energy saver preferences, that's probably showing the message. Then it's just a case of waiting til the cron shutdown time :) <comment28691> This is what my crontab thing looks like: http://cl.ly/363p2J3M3F2x0q042x1c This is 10:30 PM? It just passed and nothing happened. <comment28887> Energy Saver Â» Schedule is *not* a good answer, because it will prompt the user 10 minutes before shutdown and offer to cancel the process. <comment28890> What do you mean by "app"? Does it have to be a GUI program or is launchd (which I suggest below) acceptable? If you do what a GUI app, what do you want it to do? Prompt for the time that the computer should be shutdown, when run? <comment28908> `shutdown` is in `/sbin` which is probably not in the default $PATH of cron. To fix, do the `sudo crontab -e` thing again, type `dd` to delete the line (assuming the file looks like the one you linked above) and reenter the line as `30 22 * * * /sbin/shutdown -h now`. <comment28960> @patrix Top man, I missed out the /sbin/! This works now :) <comment29007> @patrix thanks a lot! <comment36074> Whilst this may theoretically answer the question, [it would be preferable](http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/8259) to include the essential parts of the answer here, and provide the link for reference. <comment43641> When adding the shutdown command to a launchd agent in /Library/LaunchAgents/, it didnt work and 'console' would log 'shutdown: NOT super-user'. Perhaps this would have worked in /System/Library/LaunchAgents (but you're not supposed to put stuff there :-)) I only needed a normal shutdown, so I went with the osascript, and put it in ~/Library/LaunchAgents/bla.shutdown.plist. Worked fine. <comment43642> I had to use codeosascript -e 'tell app "Finder" to shut down'/code though <comment171028> This is the only correct answer. (in my opinion) <comment190434> How to cancel this crontab? <comment258547> yeah how do you reverse this if you don't want to do this anymore?
