brew bundle reporting "Error: unknown command: bundle" <body> I'm completely puzzled by this one. I have refactored my install scripts to use the new codebrew bundle/code feature. However, I'm getting "Error: unknown command: bundle"  precode$ which brew /usr/local/bin/brew  $ brew -v Homebrew 0.9.5  $ brew doctor Please note that these warnings are just used to help the Homebrew maintainers with debugging if you file an issue. If everything you use Homebrew for is working fine: please don't worry and just ignore them. Thanks!  Warning: You have a curlrc file If you have trouble downloading packages with Homebrew, then maybe this is the problem? If the following command doesn't work, then try removing your curlrc:   curl http://github.com  $ brew update Already up-to-date.  $ cat ~/.dotfiles/install/brewfile-basic # Important early installs  install hub # https://hub.github.com install git-extras # https://github.com/visionmedia/git-extras install bash-completion # http://bash-completion.alioth.debian.org  # Cleaning up Brew caches  linkapps cleanup prune  $ brew bundle ~/.dotfiles/install/brewfile-basic Error: Unknown command: bundle  $ brew bundle Error: Unknown command: bundle /code/pre  In all other ways, codebrew/code is working.  Any ideas? Is this feature not in the current build?  -- Christopher Allen  <answer148465> According to my question on this topic in the issues section of the homebrew repository, brew bundle has been deprecated.  https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/issues/32952  <answer152447> In essence, all commands you had in your Brewfile can be used in a bash script.  If you want to have a single file for your packages listing, one per line, and read it from your bash script, you can do codebrew install $(cat my-file-with-dependencies)/code.  Suppose you have in codebrewfile-basic/code:  precodehub git-extras bash-completion /code/pre  Now create codebrewbundle.sh/code:  precodebrew install $(cat brewfile-basic)  # Cleaning up Brew caches  brew linkapps brew cleanup brew prune /code/pre  You haven't run this command for a while. For the last months, it was said it was deprecated.  <comment201177> There's a new official alternative here now though: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-brewdler
