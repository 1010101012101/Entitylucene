Why is my Airport Express so much slower than ethernet? <body> I'm using the dual-band Airport Express and seeing download speeds of at least 50% that of an ethernet connection.  I get ~120 Mbps down at peak with ethernet; usually I'll see a peak down of ~70 Mbps with my Airport Express. I'm currently seeing ~25 Mbps down.  My network information is as follows:  codeCurrent Network Information: Plato:   PHY Mode: 802.11n   BSSID:    20:c9:d0:a4:d4:68   Channel:  1   Country Code: US   Network Type: Infrastructure   Security: WPA2 Personal   Signal / Noise:   -59 dBm / -92 dBm   Transmit Rate:    117   MCS Index:    13 /code  The transmit rate is typically 300.  Any thoughts as to why this might be happening, what I can do to isolate the issue, and ideally what I can do to fix it?  <comment146469> Did you try changing the Chanel? <comment146474> I hadn't yet. I have it set to automatic. <comment146475> I downloaded WiFi Explorer and set it to a channel that's not taken by another network. Still getting the same poor rate. It says the max rate for 2.4 GHz is 144 Mbps and 300 Mbps for 5 GHz. But the best I'm getting even on 5 GHz is ~70 Mbps.
