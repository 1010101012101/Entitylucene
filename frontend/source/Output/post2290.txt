How do I get Google Notifier (Mac) to report the number of new messages in Priority Inbox? <body> I'm using Google Notifier for Mac 1.10.6.879 and I want it to report the number of new messages in Priority Inbox. Previously, I had Notifier report the number of unread messages that had a certain label assigned to it (it was a quasi-Priority Inbox). I set up the notifier by going into terminal and typing:  precodedefaults write com.google.GmailNotifier Label -string "LABEL" /code/pre  When I substitute out LABEL for Priority Inbox, it doesn't provide an accurate unread count:  precodedefaults write com.google.GmailNotifier Label -string "Priority Inbox" /code/pre  Doesn't it make complete sense that Google Notifier and Priority Inbox should work together?!  <answer2293> I think that the label GMail uses for the Priority Inbox is "Important". Have you tried using that?  <comment1945> Kyle, you rule. Thanks! <comment13399> This still shows old and read messages. How do you fix that?
