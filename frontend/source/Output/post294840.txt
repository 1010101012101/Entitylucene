What email was read on my MacBook? <body> My MacBook Air (osx el capitan) was used during my absence and some mails (on the Mail App paired with the gmail account) were also read. It is essential for me to check which mails were read. Is there any "activity history" in Mail App/ gmail/ macbook to check what exactly was done during that time? Thank you for an answer and sorry if the question is stupid.
