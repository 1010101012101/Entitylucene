Can I turn off the screen with a keyboard shortcut? <body> One of the first customizations I make in Windows is to install WinBubble, an awesome piece of software that lets me add an option the the right-click menu of the desktop: 'Turn Off Monitor.' It's really quite awesome.  Now that I'm using Macs more and more, I want to know how to do this on a Mac. But instead of using the mouse (yes, I'm a keyboard guy), I want to use the keyboard.  Is it possible for me to turn off the screen with a keyboard shortcut? I'm thinking AppleScript - but something simpler is definitely better.  <answer46170> Control+Shift+Power For current Mac keyboard layouts. Control+Shift+Eject works for older keyboard layouts that still include the Eject key.  This page explains some alternate solutions as well.  Also, if you have "Require password after sleep or screen saver begins" set to immediately in strongSystem Preferences/strong - strongSecurity &amp; Privacy/strong, it will ask you for your password after doing this.  <answer46171> Yes - shift-ctrl-eject is the keyboard shortcut for this.  <comment52683> it's a photo finish! <comment52684> Wow. Two answers, 11 seconds apart. I'll have to give this one to you. May I ask where you found this? I looked in Apple's record of keyboard shortcuts and found nada. I can't give you the answer for 11 minutes, though. <comment52685> Here's an Apple article with these shortcuts- http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2448 I think I found that one out by accident, though. <comment52688> Found mine on Mac OS X Hints. <comment53803> This _does not work_ for new macs that lack an eject key. Not sure what does, just pointing out that some macs can't do this operation out of the box. <comment53862> @bmike this page explains some solutions for that http://www.midwesternmac.com/blogs/jeff-geerling/force-sleep-display-2010-2011 <comment53864> Woah - points here for summarizing and showing me I can put a modifier key on hot corners! FTFW! http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/47018/replacing-shortcuts-that-use-the-eject-key-on-macbook-air-lacking-such-a-physica <comment53866> Hadn't even seen your question yet! :) <comment234574> Just for the record, I don't believe this prevents your computer from going to sleep (eventually). You need to do an extra step for that: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/120639/how-can-i-stop-my-macbook-pro-from-automatically-sleeping-when-i-lock-the-screen
