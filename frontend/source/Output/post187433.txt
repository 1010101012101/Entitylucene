Setting up Port Forwarding for 2 y-cams on an Airport Extreme Base Station <body> I recently purchased the latest version of the Apple Extreme Base Station and I have 2 Y-cam IP cameras (Knight S and Cube) that I use for baby/kid monitors.  I want to configure them to be viewable from the outside internet and I cannot to get them working.  I have configured the Public UDP/TCP ports to use assigned ports and private UPD/TCP ports to 80 in the Network - Port Settings menu.  I have also given each camera a static IP address in each individual camera settings.  I also tried setting up a DHCP Reservation for one of the cameras using the DHCP Reservations setting in the Network section.  Does you have suggestions I could try to troubleshoot this issue?  bUpdate/b  For each Y-cam, under TCP/IP and UPNP setup I can configure the HTTP/RSTP port and RTP port ranges.  Under the UPNP setup it asks for the External HTTP/RSTP and RTP port ranges.  In the AirPort Utility, when I set up the IPv4 Port Mapping, it asks for public/private UDP/TCP ports.  So my question is, which port type in the Y-cam maps to the port type in the Airport Utility set up?
