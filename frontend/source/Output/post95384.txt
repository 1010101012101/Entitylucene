Changing the command prompt of Terminal <body> I have found myself to grow fond to CentOS's command prompt which looks like the following:  precode [user@host directory]$ cmd /code/pre  I, personally, do not like how Mac OS X Terminal is laid out, which is:  precode host:directory user$ cmd /code/pre  Is there any way to change the prompt of Terminal's commands to make it look more like the first one? I am very new to these things.  <answer95386> If you are using bash, simply do PS1='[\u@\h \w]$ '  More details and options in man bash (search for PROMPTING)  If tcsh, do man tcsh and search for "prompt"  <comment111857> That worked perfectly! Thank you! <comment111858> Also, I had to use \W instead of \w, because CentOS shows just the directory name, not the path.
