Did you try re-download file? <comment293950> Which Mac are you trying to upgrade, specifically? <comment293971> Two options - you might work with Apple Support to narrow down the error or you might need to edit in some specifics. What date is the Mac set to, do any App Store downloads work? Is the Mac hardware compatible with el cap?
