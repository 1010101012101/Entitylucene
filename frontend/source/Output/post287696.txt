MacBook Update Hanging on Second Part <body> I changed the logic board in my mac and I'm having difficulty with updating. I have tried using internet recovery to fresh install sirran and now USB installing El Captain.  I get to this stage and it completes all this: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/86Nul.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Then restarts and it hangs on this: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3hOUb.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Can anyone help?  MacBook Air 2011 11" Was i5 1.6 2gb Now i7 1.8 4gb  <comment363284> How long did you wait? Sometimes it takes really long. <comment363290> I left it about half an hour. But another time I left it over night and it did nothing. I hard powered it off and started it. It seems to all work... <comment363291> That would have been my next proposal. I had the same problem once, but it was all fine after a hard reboot. <comment363292> It's strange as it's a fresh install and happened on two different versions and separate downloads
