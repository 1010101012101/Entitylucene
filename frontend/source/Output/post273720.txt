Map the right ALT key to Option, instead of Command <body> I'm using a Corsair K70 keyboard with my Macbook Pro.  I've changed the modifier keys so that the ALT key, to the left of the spacebar, is the Command key instead, to replicate the layout on a Apple keyboard.  I would like to change the ALT key to the right of the spacebar, to map it to the Option key instead of the Command key like the left ALT key is. Is that possible?  I have installed Karabiner for OSX but I'm not sure how to use it to achieve what I want.
