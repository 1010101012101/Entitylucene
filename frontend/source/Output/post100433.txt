Finder- Reopen Last Closed Window <body> Finder does not seem to navigate to the last folder opened. For instance, when I am saving several files or images - it would be nice to (and used to ) open in the last place I placed something - now it defaults to "User" and I have to navigate each time - very frustrating.  <answer100435> In Finder, use the codeGo/code in menu = codeRecent Folders/code. This is the closest you can get to     "open[ing] in the last place I placed something"   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LRSRN.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongMore Information/strong:  If you don't like the default, you can change the default Finder window to open as well. Go to codePreferences in Finder/code.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/I0AzQ.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment118249> You are correct that Finder doesn't work in the way you describe. Are you looking perhaps for software to add this function like [DefaultFolderX](http://www.stclairsoft.com/DefaultFolderX/) or more interested in knowing if you have missed a setting? <comment359725> Thanks, this was helpful. Do you happen to know of any hot keys that will perform that same task (the equiv. of `shift + cmd + t` in Chrome to open the last closed tab)?
