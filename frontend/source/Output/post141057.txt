“Sign in to download from the App Store” dialog does not allow paste <body> OSX 10.8.5  I am using lastPass and have the appleID in there so I can copy and paste whenever needed.  Sometimes when I am told I have an upgrade I am asked to sign in to the app store. Annoying but ok. So I have generated a quite safe password - why am I not able to paste that into the password field? Any setting I can change? (I obscured the appleID in the picture below)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JU048.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer141981> You can use strongKeyboard Maestro/strong with a macro such as this which takes the current clipboard and inserts its contents by typing it rather than pasting, allowing the clipboard to be entered into fields where pasting is forbidden.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8x2Np.png" width="563"  Also, for what it's worth, OS X 10.10 Yosemite does let you paste into the aforementioned field and I believe so does 10.9 Mavericks.  <answer142511> h1AppleScript/h1  So, as I wrote in the comments, you can do this with AppleScript. Here I show how to create a service that types your clipboard using 'keystrokes'.  First create an automator 'Service' project and add a 'Run AppleScript' module. Enter the following script.  pre class="lang-as prettyprint-override"codeset clipboardText to (the clipboard as text) set theCharacters to characters of clipboardText repeat with char in theCharacters     tell application "System Events"         keystroke char     end tell end repeat  return input /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HmV7v.png" alt="Run applescript in automator"  Now you can find this 'Service' in your 'Service' menu.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/92DcP.png" alt="service menu"  You can also create a keyboard shortcut (for example kbdctrl/kbdkbdshift/kbdkbdv/kbd) in your System Preferences [Keyboard - Shortcuts - Services]. Now you can 'type' your clipboard anywhere when pressing kbdctrl/kbdkbdshift/kbd.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VM4jd.png" alt="keyboard shortcut services"  <answer162829> One possibility - right click &amp; select Paste from the drop menu.  Works for several 'awkward to paste to' destinations.  <answer162832> Yosemite (possibly even Mavericks) solved the issue  <comment167329> I might be missing something here. But are you ever allowed to paste a password into an OSX password field? <comment167340> Possibly not which is why I am looking for workarounds <comment167342> Any free solution? My iMac is too old to upgrade <comment167345> Applescript could do some typing I guess. No clue how. <comment167887> Learned some applescript today. Let me know if it worked. Good luck <comment167935> Thanks! I will try that - I will follow [this tutorial](http://arstechnica.com/apple/2011/03/howto-build-mac-os-x-services-with-automator-and-shell-scripting/) <comment190477> There are still some fields you cannot paste to, unfortunately, for which right-click/paste seems to work - though I'm glad you got your issue solved :)
