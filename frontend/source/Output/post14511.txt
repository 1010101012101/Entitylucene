Is there any software for mac to create this particular 3d histogram? <body> Is there any software for mac to create this particular 3d histogram:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7UEuH.gif" alt="3d histogram"br given a matrix of value?  I've tried with Numbers but it doesn't have 3d histograms.  <answer14512> Mathematica is able to do this.  <answer14513> You can do things like that in MatLab or the free clone Octave. There's a script here.   <answer14517> Grapher is probably the app you are looking for. It is already installed on your Mac by default.  <answer14520> Gnuplot mught be ablo to do this. I've seen pictures where something like this is done:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yZ3or.png" alt="hist example"  <answer15798> Microsoft Excel works for this sort of graph as well.  <answer30890> R Studio (the wonderful IDE for R) can do this. It's the kind of the thing it was meant to do really. Free, open source and, IMO, easier to grasp than Octave (and free, wherease Matlab is most definitely not). You'll likely want the RGL addon to do a 3D plot.  There's a StackOverflow question that deals with how you go about plotting the 3D histogram in R.  <answer36852> LibreOffice (~ OpenOffice ~ NeoOffice) to give some free office applications.  <comment15639> I see.. but you know, Matlab is though to install and then I've to code.. it is a bit though solution. I have a table in excel/Numbers with these values, it would be great to just copy paste this table and generate the graph... <comment15640> Any tiny software doing that by just adding values to a table ? <comment15644> @Patrick Of course, I was surprised that I couldn't find something in a quick google search. But I guess diagrams like this aren't mainstream enough for specialised software, so you have to use mathematics stuff. <comment15646> Uhm, the software you suggest is more for draw analytical functions... etc in 2D and 3D. I don't see the option to draw histograms given a set of values. <comment15647> @romeovs I might be wrong but I can't see 3d histograms in Gnuplot as well.
