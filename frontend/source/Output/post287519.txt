How are Notes Preferences Stored in MacOS? <body> Does the Mac Notes app store its preferences in a plist somewhere, or does it have a different method of storage? It doesn't seem to use code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.notes/code as most system apps do.  I'm hoping to find a method to script its settings programmatically (i.e. codedefaults write/code or similar).  h2Update/h2  As Alexander noted, Notes is sandboxed, and stores some data accessible via codedefaults [read|write] com.apple.Notes/code (case sensitive). However the preference pane settings I'm looking for (specifically the emNew notes start with/em setting) don't seem to be saved there. I'm hoping someone else can find where that might be kept.  <answer287522> codeNotes.app/code is sandboxed.  Its sandbox is code~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Notes//code  Its preference list can be found at code~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Notes/Data/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Notes.plist/code  <comment363083> Thanks. seems that `defaults read com.apple.Notes` (case sensitive) finds it in the sandbox just fine. Unfortunately it doesn't seem to save all its preferences there. Most of the preferences window options don't seem to have a corresponding key. I'll leave the question open for a while to see if anyone comes up with anything.
