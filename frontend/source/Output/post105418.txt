How to access LAN devices and files from iPad, iPhone? <body> Are there any strongfree iOS applications/strong that let us browse LAN devices, so we could access files from devices in same network.  I use ES File Explorer to do the same in Android phone but I didn't find any free application on iOS. Most of the file explorer for android mobiles include this functionality.  Any such strongfree app/strong?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YXUNX.jpg" width="360"  <answer148568> iFileExplorer may be what you need. It is free on App store. I am using it.  <comment124526> There are tons of such apps in the App Store. Maybe you can add some details about specific functionality/protocols you are looking for or list the apps you've tried but didn't like? <comment124585> I tried few of the applications like File Explorer, but it required paid/ full version to access those functionality. As I mentioned I only want to access shared files from the devices on same network (LAN) <comment174980> Could you expand your answer, preferably with a citation? <comment175020> here is the link https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ifileexplorer/id355253462?mt=8
