Can malware be the source or 600% load on 8-core i7 processor with nothing in Activity Monitor nor `top`? <body> My Mac suddenly started showing a heavy processor load, i.e. 600% or more.  When I checked in iStat Menus, Activity Monitor and codesudo top/code, no process was shown to consume more than 10%.  Should I worry about malware?  precode  Model Identifier: MacBookPro11,3   Processor Name:   Intel Core i7   Processor Speed:  2,6 GHz   Number of Processors: 1   Total Number of Cores:    4 /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7atF3.jpg" alt="Pic as it happened"  <comment300225> The screenshot of AM only shows your processes. Enable In the Activity Monitor menubar: View - All processes. Please also add the medium CPU core and the Palm Rest and/or hard drive temperature (as shown in iStat Menus) <comment300238> Try running a scan with Avast or BitDefender!
