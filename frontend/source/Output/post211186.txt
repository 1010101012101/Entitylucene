Corner radius of Macbooks? <body> I'm working on a sticker which I'll attach to a 15 inch MacBook Pro. I know that the size is:  precodeHeight: 0.71 inch (1.8 cm) Width: 14.13 inches (35.89 cm) Depth: 9.73 inches (24.71 cm) /code/pre  but what about the corner radius? And is it the same as the other MacBooks? I'm using a 13 inch MacBook Air and don't have access to a 15 inch MacBook Pro.  Thanks!  btl;dr/b  What's the corner radius of a 15 inch MacBook Pro?   <comment254969> You say you're using both a 15in MBP and a 13in MBA.
