Keynote 4.0 on Mavericks <body> I much prefer Keynote 4.0 (iWork'08) that came with my iMac OSX 10.5.8.   I bought a Macbook Air with Mavericks and Keynote 6. If I download Keynote 4.0 will it work on the Macbook?  Thanks   <comment145411> I have Keynote '09 (version 5.3) and that works on Mavericks. I'm not sure about '08. It won't hurt to copy it over from your old computer and give it a try. If you migrated your system over, the app might already be in your applications folder, probably in a folder called "iWork '08" (mine is in "iWork '09")
