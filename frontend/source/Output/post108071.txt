How can I edit a file without altering its modif date? <body> How can I edit a file without altering its modification date ? In command line. Is codevi/code able to that ?  <answer108075> The only way I can think of is to store it's modification date before altering it and then to set it back again.   I'm not aware of any CLI tool that would allow you to do that, however years ago I've written something in C that I used to set the modification date on a file to arbitrary value. I know this is not the answer that you're looking for, but I would do this the following way:   ol liget the original access time and the modification time for a file, before you alter it. For this, you can just use codestat()/code system call (read more about it by issuing codeman 2 stat/code). /li lialter the file, using codevi/code or any other editor you like/li liset the modification time back to what it was. This can be done using the codeutimes()/code call (again, you can read more by issuing codeman 2 utimes/code command). Please note, codeutimes()/code sets both the access time and the modification time./li /ol  strongEdit/strong   Actually it seems like there's already a CLI tool that can do that. According to this answer: How to change the creation (st_birthtime) date/time of a file in Lion?, you can use codetouch/code command to change those times: codetouch -m/code changes the modification time and codetouch -a/code changes the access time (you can use both options in one call). All you'd need to do then is use the codestat/code command line on the file before you modify it and display its access and modification times. Then do the edit and after that, use codetouch/code to set the access/modification times back to their values from before the edit.  <answer108126> You can use touch -t to change the modification and access times, touch -m to change the modification time, or touch -a to change the access time. All of them also change the creation time if the target time is before the original creation time.  precode$ ls -lT test.txt -rw-r--r--  1 lauri  staff  3 Nov  3 15:13:42 2013 test.txt $ date -jf %s $(stat -f%m test.txt) +%Y%m%d%H%M.%S 201311031513.42 $ vi test.txt $ ls -lT test.txt -rw-r--r--  1 lauri  staff  3 Nov  3 15:18:18 2013 test.txt $ touch -t 201311031513.42 test.txt $ ls -lT test.txt -rw-r--r--  1 lauri  staff  3 Nov  3 15:13:42 2013 test.txt /code/pre  stat -f%m specifies the format string as the modification time. In date -jf, -j disables setting the time and -f specifies the format.  <comment126736> All of this is complicated. But I may end using some of these commands. Thank you Mike.
