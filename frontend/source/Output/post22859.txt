"-bash: ls: command not found" <body> I installed the most recent update to OS X Lion (10.7). After I did that, my terminal won't recognize normal commands. I typed codels/code and got:  precode-bash: ls: command not found /code/pre  I figured I'd try to add usr/bin to my path, but I can't find .bash_profile to edit it since typing codeedit .bash_profile/code won't work. I can't set the Finder to show all files since my terminal won't recognize the commands necessary to do that.   what do I need to do?  <answer22862> Since two commands are missing something “stomped” your path.   Before doing anything big, kicking off a backup might be prudent.  The default path on Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion) is something like this:  precodePATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11/bin /code/pre  You can reset the path by typing the above into a shell window, and then typing codeexport PATH/code  So you can start there and see what else might be amiss.  <answer22901> To check that it is indeed a problem with your path, what's the result of code/bin/ls/code ?   If it works, than you should restore your path to code/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11/bin/code, you can use for example codeVI/code whose path is (on my mac) code/usr/bin/vi/code.  <answer23158> It sounds to me as if code/etc/profile/code wasn't run at shell startup. It's the global startup file responsible for initializing PATH. Check whether code/etc/profile/code exists and is readable and executable with the following command:  precode. /etc/profile /code/pre  If it isn't there, you'll need to restore it from a backup or another machine with Lion installed, or install Lion again. If it exists but isn't executable, try using Disk Utility to Repair Disk Permissions.  If it does exist and is executable (and it contains some code), either it may not be getting run when it's supposed to or your startup script may somehow be overriding it. As a workaround, try putting code. /etc/profile/code at the start of your code~/.bash_profile/code to ensure it is run. If you still encounter the problem, add codeecho $PATH/code after running it to see if PATH was initialized properly. If it was, something in your script is changing it.  Here's the default contents of code/etc/profile/code:  precode# System-wide .profile for sh(1)  if [ -x /usr/libexec/path_helper ]; then     eval `/usr/libexec/path_helper -s` fi  if [ "${BASH-no}" != "no" ]; then     [ -r /etc/bashrc ] &amp;&amp; . /etc/bashrc fi /code/pre  codepath_helper/code constructs the default PATH. You could try running  precodeunset PATH; /usr/libexec/path_helper -s /code/pre  to see what it produces.  In any case, if the problem isn't in your startup script(s), please contact Apple support http://www.apple.com/support/contact/ or report a bug at https://bugreport.apple.com/ to let Apple know there's a problem.  <answer223458> I was trying to set my maven path to envoronment variables when this happened. So I just moved my .profile and .bash_profile file to trash and tried again and it worked.  <answer236636> you can export the path as follows:  export PATH=$PATH:/bin:/usr/local/bin  <answer290760> This should fix the problem completely and permanently.  first, export environment paths by using below command in the terminal.  precodeexport PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11/b‌​in /code/pre  now you have the commands you want. (eg. try codels/code. You'll see the command is working). But this is only for the current session. If you close the terminal and open a new one, you will have the previous issue. To make this change permanent, use below command,  go to home directory  precodecd ~ /code/pre  open .bash_profile file in nano / vim (I'm using nano here)  precodenano .bash_profile /code/pre  This will open up nano editor. In a new line, paste the following;  precodeexport PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11/bin:$PATH /code/pre  press 'control'+'o' to save (WriteOut) and 'control'+'x' to exit nano.   All done ! Now try the commands.   <comment25488> Let's get a path and see what shakes out. `export PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11/bin` paste the dark part (or type it VERY CAREFULLY) - since two commands are missing - something whacked your path. Before doing anything big, kicking off a backup might be prudent. <comment25491> @bmike thanks! added that to .bash_profile and it's all working now. had to open .bash_profile like this: `/usr/bin/vi ~/.bash_profile` Put that as an answer and I can accept! <comment161544> For me, this provides a temporary fix. <comment161545> `unset PATH; /usr/libexec/path_helper -s` shows me PATH that is not contained in my `/etc/profile`.  Any suggestions? <comment161549> Running `. /etc/profile` temporarily fixes the problem.  I have pasted into the top of my `~/.bash_profile`, but it appears that this is not run either. <comment161553> linked to http://superuser.com/questions/573633/bash-profile-not-sourced/583493#comment714563_583493 ? <comment161598> Check the bash man page for the complete list of startup files and the order in which they are searched. If you have a login file it takes precedence over the profile, for example. Check for other startup files. <comment289606> Welcome to Ask Different!
