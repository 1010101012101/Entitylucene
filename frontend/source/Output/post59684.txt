My 13-inch MacBook from 2008 will not connect to the wireless network. Any suggestions? <body> My 13-inch MacBook from 2008 will not connect to the wireless network.  It worked last week, and then they installed a new router and it stopped.  My coworkers (with Dells) are fine.  There is no new password or anything.  Any suggestions?  I've got Mac OS X Lion 10.7.4 as my software right now.  My computer will still connect to other wireless networks, so it isn't a problem that I can tell with my Airport.  <comment68715> Try restarting the network: both modem and router or just router to see if that helps. <comment68719> I tried that to no avail. <comment68723> Have you tried deleting the network from the list of known networks in System Preferences and then starting over with it? Another thing to check is if there are any log entries giving more detail on the connection failure in the Console utility. <comment68767> When you say there is no "new" password are you saying there is a password but it is not new, or there was no password ever: an open network? Can you get access to the router's configuration controls? If yes, try turning off WEP to see if you can connect. If yes then turn WEP back on, change the password and help the Dells back on.
