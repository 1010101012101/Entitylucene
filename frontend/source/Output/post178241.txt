Latest (March 2015) flash player installer crashes on 10.9.5 <body> When I try to install flash player (the latest security update as of 3/25/15) on my machine it crashes. Removed the old one, both using the uninstall and the manual uninstall (removed plugin and install manager folders), verified that mach_kernel is not missing, and rebooted. The installer crashes every time.  <comment211095> try the distribution installer - see http://superuser.com/a/827335/347380 <comment211098> I presume you deleted com.adobe.flash.plist from /Library/Preferences, and com.adobe.flashplayer.installmanager from /Library/Caches, both in your home folder? <comment211119> There are 2 Flash Players types. One is a plug-in and it is specific to the browser. The other one is stand alone Flash Player. app The first one is in your system preferences and you can update it from there. The second one is in your Applications folder. I presume you are talking  about the plug-in version.
