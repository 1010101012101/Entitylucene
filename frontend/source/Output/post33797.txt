Adding files to iPad via iTunes not working since iOS upgrade <body> I upgraded my iPad 1 to iOS 5.0.1 and now I can't do file sharing through my apps in iTunes.  I've tried it with VLC, GoodPlayer, ComicBookLover, Penultimate, Evernote, etc and adding the file doesn't do anything.  Here is a video with what I'm trying to do:  http://www.screenr.com/4N6s  I had the iPhone SDK on my computer, so I uninstalled that, I uninstalled iTunes and reinstalled it .. not sure what else I can do!  <comment38594> Funnily enough I had a similar problem when trying to replicate the problem, but got at least an error message. Restarting iTunes fixed it, but you already have done that. Hmmm. <comment38603> I've done a lot of stuff so far ... even called Apple .. they seem to think that it's the 3rd party apps causing the problems :| .. not sure how all of them could be the problem.. <comment38604> I'm very close to my last resort of completely wiping my ipad and starting from scratch .. but then I won't have VLC
