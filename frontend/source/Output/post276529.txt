Set label to multiple files/folder same time with automator? <body> I have a service workflow and a key combination for it to label a selected file to a specific label/colour. But this only works for one file at a time, not mulitple selected files and folders. Even though the service icon is flashing in the menu bar the selected files dosen't get a label. How can label multiple files at the same time? If there is an easy solution not including automator I'm open for that too.   This is my workflow. I've tried to change the Service receives selected dropdown box to other values but then the workflow doesn't work at all.  El Capitan and Path Finder (not Finder) if that is relevant.  img src="https://image.ibb.co/czD6rF/Screen_Shot_2017_03_16_at_20_39_39.png" alt="workflow"
