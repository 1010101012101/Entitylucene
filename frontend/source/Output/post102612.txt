Is there a way to prevent iOS 7 from changing the colors of wallpaper images? <body> When I create a custom wallpaper image and assign it to the lock screen on iOS 7, the colors of the image are changed. Oddly, if I take a screen capture of the lock screen, the colors match those of the original image.  Is there a way to prevent this? Is it intentional? Perhaps there's something subtle about color management on iOS that I'm missing.  hr  Note: Providing images that document this is (clearly) tricky, but I hope to have some soon. In the meantime, perhaps this is a known issue or feature that someone can help with.  <answer102617> There is a toggle you can flip to increase this effect even further.  Settings - General - Accessibility - Increase Contrast  I'm a bit surprised the screen capture restores the original color, but I'm not surprised that on iOS devices with a powerful GPU that processing is happening on something as layered as the home screen / springboard view. That processing is one of the main design features of iOS 7 as I see it. Increasing text legibility on the home screen and the lock screen are clearly design considerations I would expect to see - even if they are subtle or slight as you describe for your current choice of custom image.  <comment120769> Could it be something to do with the "parallax" feature? To turn it off, go into Settings  General  Accessibility  Reduce Motion (turn it on) <comment120770> Good thought; but no. <comment120773> I haven't quantified the effect, but what I'm seeing could, as you suggest, be some kind of contrast enhancement; the effect is diminished in dimmer ambient lighting. The result however is certainly *not* to provide much legibility (that would require a different typeface). <comment120777> Maybe the lock screen can only properly display web-safe colors. Are your colors web-safe?
