Weird User in my login screen "puppet" <body> I just restarted my mac em"OSX El Capitan v10.11.1"/em and I'm seeing a weird User in my login screen called em"puppet"/em:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rBeWt.jpg" alt=""  I have not created this User and I don't know how to log on it.  The most concerning part is that I'm not able to delete it because I can't find it in the emSystem Preferences  Users &amp; Groups/em:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DeA8O.jpg" alt=""  Neither in the code/Users/code folder:  precode$ ls -l /Users/ total 0 drwxr-xr-x+ 11 Guest     _guest   374 Nov 23  2013 Guest drwxrwxrwt   6 root      wheel    204 Oct 20 12:00 Shared drwxr-xr-x+ 80 myuser    staff   2720 Dec  7 09:40 myuser /code/pre  One explanation I can imagine is that the automatization systems management tool I'm using (puppet) has created this weird User.. but the other explanation I can imagine concerns me more: I've been hacked :/  Nothing in /etc/passwd:  precode$ cat /etc/passwd | grep puppet # -&gt; nothing /code/pre  This file has been just created, looks like with my last restart:  precode$ sudo ls -l /var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/users/puppet.plist -rw-------  1 root  wheel  2775 Dec  7 09:38 /var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/users/puppet.plist /code/pre  Have someone an explanation for this? How can I delete that User?  <answer218528> As per puppet doc for mac installation:     The puppet master service needs a puppet user and group.   So you can be sure now that you haven't been hacked :)  <answer218779> FYI, you can hide this user from the login screen:  precodesudo dscl . create /Users/puppet IsHidden 1  /code/pre  Or in pre-Yosemite versions:  precodedefaults write  /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow HiddenUsersList -array-add puppet /code/pre  Source  <comment264185> Is it in /etc/passwd? <comment264187> @CedricH. nothing there, check the update <comment264188> Wow.. the puppet people should put this in red letters all around their website.. it is very weird to see a _magic User_ in your system with such a hacker-likely name :) <comment264345> Well, if you copy&pasted puppet recipies from random web sites, you will be hacked sooner or later anyway. These recipies have root access... <comment264367> @fguillen - I am not surprised they don't as if they understood OS X then the user would not appear. If the user id is less than 500 it does not appear as a login but just as a plain Unix login
