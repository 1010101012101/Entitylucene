iMac WiFi issue <body> I leave my iMac (24') on almost 24/7, putting it to sleep while not in use. Sometimes when I resume from sleep I encounter the following:  ol liWiFi shows full signal/li liLoading web page in Safari loads slowly then stops/li liWiFi sometimes shows degraded signal at this point, but sometimes it doesnt/li liI disable then enable the Airport using the icon at the top of the screen/li liWiFi works as expected/li /ol  Rebooting the computer fixes this issue, but it is becoming annoying. Is it a know issue, and can it be resolved?  <answer739> Try to check "Disconnect when logging out" on the emAdvanced/em preferences of Airport :   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5oQ7F.png" alt="airport"  <comment622> What type of Wifi router is the iMac connecting to? Is it the only device connected to the router when the issue occurs? <comment637> I forget what brand it is (net gear I think), but we have the iMac, a MacBook, MacBook pro, four iPhones, and the iPad connected to it, and the iMac is the only device experiencing this issue. <comment1337> Havent been having any issues lately, so marking as answer :) Thanks you Studer. <comment6491> I have not encountered the issue again since implementing this solution. I am confident that it is a winner :-)
