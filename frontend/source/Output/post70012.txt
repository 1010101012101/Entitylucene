How can I connect 2 non apple screens to my 13" mac book pro? <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   Can I plug two external monitors in to a MacBook Pro?       I've just purchased a new non-retina MacBook Pro 13" with the latest version of OS X (10.8.2).  I want to connect my two 22" displays (Samsung and LG) to my MBP and have a 3 screen workstation (laptop screen + 2 screens).  One external screen has got a VGA port and the other a DVI. The screen that has a VGA port has also got a DVI input.  Assuming I buy a VGA adapter that enables me to connect VGA to my MBP, could I connect my second screen to the first using the DVI port and see the 3 screens?  <answer70018> I believe the answer is yes:  This should do it: http://www.iogear.com/product/GUC2015V/  As should this:   http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/searchtools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=6939907&amp;SRCCODE=WEBGOOPA&amp;cm_mmc_o=mH4CjC7BBTkwCjCV1-CjCE&amp;gclid=CJyRgoSVp7MCFQ-f4AodtFAAHg  <answer70219> ol liGet a Mini DisplayPort to DVI adaptor, these cost around 5 bucks on ebay.

Here are some previous questions regarding this issue: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/7488/can-i-plug-two-external-monitors-in-to-a-macbook-pro and http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3894/can-i-connect-more-than-one-external-monitor-to-the-late-2010-macbook-air <comment81321> I've never seen good performance out of USB 2.0 display adapters.  Would a USB 3.0 version be any better?  If he got a new MacBook Pro it should have USB 3.0 ports. <comment81333> according to the [specs](http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/specs/), you can only drive one external display - "Dual display and video mirroring: Simultaneously supports full native resolution on the built-in display and up to 2560 by 1600 pixels on an external display, both at millions of colors" <comment81526> I strongly recommend against this, they simply don't perform well.
