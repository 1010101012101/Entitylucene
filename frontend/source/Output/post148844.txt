In Mail, how to navigate from single email to entire conversation? <body> I'm using Mail 7.3 on OS X 10.9.5. I have Organize by Conversation turned on.  I frequently have a scenario where I do a Spotlight search to find an email, select a result which opens that single email in a window, but then I want to navigate from that single email to the entire conversation thread so I can see it in context. Is this possible?  I know in the single email window, I can right-click on the title and it shows the folder tree for that email but clicking the parent folder only goes to that parent folder, not to the specific thread for that email.
