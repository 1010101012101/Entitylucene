Mass Change Security to Mac App only option <body> looking to see if others have created a successful way in using ARD to deploy a script to change the security settings from Mac App &amp; Identified developers to Mac App store only.  OSX - 10.9.5 Units from 2009 til now but same exact image on all of them.  My school has some smarty kids and are using a flash drive to install apps even though they are approved identified developers under security &amp; privacy.  I have about 1800 iMacs and 2000 Macbook Airs  looks to have this change to Mac App Store only and hope fully / should resolve this matter so they can focus more on school work.  I have been remote virtual to change a classroom of 35 it seems to work manually but i have a giant task -  Any one could help is appreciated -   I did see a forum for something like this except it was changing from anywhere to Identified developers not to the Mac App Store.
