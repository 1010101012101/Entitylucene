Upgrade iPad 1 from 4.2 to 4.3 <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   Cannot update iPad 1 to iOS 4.3 or higher        I have an iPad one that's being used for development. It currently has 4.2 on it but I'd like 4.3 on it. I've tried downloading an ipsw file and loading it in through iTunes but it rejects it saying the device is not eligible.  Any advice would be great!  Thanks!  <comment47031> Your question should be answered by this answer to a Apple.SE question: http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/31972 <comment47175> It doesn't answer it though. I said I tried that (ipsw is the ipad software/firmware) and it rejected it. That's why I created a new question rather than posting a comment on that issue, because something else is clearly wrong. Can you reopen the question for me?
