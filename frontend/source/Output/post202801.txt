Group processes by apps in Activity Monitor under Memory tab <body> I am using OSX 10.10.5 with activity monitor 10.10.0. Mac newbie.  In the memory tab, all the processes under chrome is scattered. I just want to know to how much of the resource is used by chrome all together. Is there a better app that will do it?  Basically, I want to see the resources used by all the apps that I using (seen on the side dock) grouped under the name of the apps.  <answer221807> I know this is old, but this feature does exist: Go to Activity Monitor, click "View" (at the top) and select "All Processes, Hierarchically".  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CcQY6.png" alt="group processes Hierarchically"  Hope this helps someone!
