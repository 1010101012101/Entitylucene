How can I make the App Store remember my password? <body> It seems that my iPod Touch (iOS 5.0.1) will keep asking for my AppleID password every time I try to install an application from App Store. It is really driving me insane.  I would be happy to add the password once at boot up instead of entering it each time.  I couldn't find a related option in Settings.  How do I change this behavior?  <answer35572> You can't change this behavior.  Although, when you download a free app, you have to enter your password; if you download another free app immediately after, you won't have to re-enter your pass.  That's as close as you're going to get to a remember password feature on iOS 5.  This is something that was intentionally in place and now it's intentionally changed on iOS 6 to reduce the need to re-enter your password just for updates.  <answer64503> Download "password pilot" in Cydia (the jailbreak app store) it will save your password so you wont have to keep entering it.   <comment40516> Yup. This additional security was added in response to kids downloading in-app upgrades within the 15-minute window and killing their parents' credit cards. Or something. <comment40520> that hardly explains why the option can't be deactivated by enabling disabling restrictions <comment40521> He asked for a way to change this behavior.  There isn't one.  No need for an explanation. <comment40522> We can't answer for Apple's decisions here, all we can do is tell you the facts.
