Previewing my HTML in Safari Using TextWrangler. <body> I've begin to construct a simple website with TextWrangler, and I have a question. In the online tutorial I'm following, the guy previews his website in Chrome. However, he is using Notepad++. Is there any way I can preview my code in Safari using TextWrangler? Thank you!  <answer54079> If it's a single page you can just open it in Safari with kbdCmd/kbd-kbdO/kbd.  If it's more elaborate, store it to code~/Sites/code, enable Web Sharing in the Sharing Preferences and point Safari to codehttp://localhost/~YOUR-USER-NAME/WHATEVER-YOU-CALLED-IT.html/code
