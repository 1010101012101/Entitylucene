New all-out installation of an old computer with time machine from another computer <body> I understand that time machine sometimes makes troubles when recovering thing it took from one computer to another computer thatâ€™s why the following question arises:  I have two Macs with the same Apple ID but different contents. Now I want to use the time machine from Mac A, erase everything from Mac B and initiate Mac B anew with the time machine from Mac A so as to have two identical computers. Is that a problem?  <answer195284> In theory no it's not a problem but you'd be better off using SuperDuper! or Carbon Copy Cloner to make an identical clone using Target Disk Mode over FireWire or Thunderbolt.  Also Apple has a built in app for migrating data via FireWire, Thunderbolt and Ethernet, even Wi-Fi if you want to wait!  The migration option is given after a fresh OS install, so if you are trying to get a clone these options would be a better bet than making a Time Machine back up then restoring from it, importantly the option for the Migration Assistant is actually in the same list of options at restoring from a Time Machine backup after a fresh OS install.
