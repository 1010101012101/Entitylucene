Just changed with a PAC but wrote in my number first <body> I just bought a iPhone 4s and I changed from tmobile to Vodafone using a PAC code. I am now waiting for my new service. However I wrote in my number on the settingsmy number. Will this effect my network transfer?  <answer140916> No - the PAC code is related only to changing the number which routes to your SIM. The number you've entered into your phone isn't for anything other than as a reminder to yourself!
