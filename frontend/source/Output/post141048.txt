NTFS External drive issue in Mac 10.9 <body> Earlier i was able to access the NTFS formatted External hard drive in my Mac 10.9 as read only device.  While trying to make the external NTFS drive writable i screwed up by unmouting it  this link     diskutil unmount /dev/disk1s1   Later when i tried mounting it again it failed     diskutil mount   Volume on disk1s1 failed to mount   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Puh87.png" alt="Error Message When i connect my External Hard drive"  <answer141167> Following the unmount you should also eject the disc before unplugging it.  precodediskutil unmount /dev/disk1s2     diskutil eject /dev/disk1s2 /code/pre  Alternatively you could use the usual methods: eject via finder, via dragging the drive icon into the waste bin, or with third-party apps like Alfred or Launchbar.
