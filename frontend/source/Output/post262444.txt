Why can't I find my office printer in the "Software" list when adding a printer? <body> I have a computer at office that I recently upgraded to sierra.  I am trying to add a Xerox office printer, but when I try to choose the Printer Software (when adding the printer), I have a very short list, and no Xerox printers there!  Choosing "Auto Select" in the Printer Add dialog box (under IP) doesn't work well with the printer (it chooses Generic PostScript Printer).  Any ideas why my printer doesn't appear in the list, and why is the list so short to begin with?  I tried finding drivers for the Xerox printer here:  http://www.support.xerox.com/support/global-printer-driver/downloads/enus.html?operatingSystem=macos1012  but I get no results.  I also checked the list of supported printers by Sierra, here  https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201465  and it is there:  WC 7556 * 3.81.1 P  <comment328837> Try [this link](https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1861?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US) at Apple Support for Xerox printer drivers.
