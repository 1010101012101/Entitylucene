What does nsurlsessiond transfer? <body> nsurlsessiond makes numerous calls to apple.com over port 80. From other posts I have learned that some of this is iCloud, system updates and similar data. Is there some analysis available about what exact data is transmitted?  <answer266398> nsurlsessiond can be called by so many different things in different cases. You can monitor what's being downloaded using (requires SIP disabled):  precodesudo fs_usage -w | grep nsurlsessiond /code/pre
