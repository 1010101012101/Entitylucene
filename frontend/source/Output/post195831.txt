Otool on JailBroken device <body> I jailbroke my iOS device running iOS 7.1.2 using Pangu. I have Cydia 1.1.23 and have installed "BigBoss Recommended Tools 1.3.2" as suggested here: otool BigBoss Recommended Tools   However, I am still unable to find otool on it. I checked in code/usr/bin/code as well and could not find otool there either.  <answer202656> I had to remove LD64 and then install the Darwin CC tools (2nd one had otool).  <comment261097> The "2nd one" being the package from the Cydia/Telesphoreo repository.
