How can Sudden Motion Sensor interrupt f.lux functionality to control screen color? <body> I have installed f.lux on my MacBook Pro (13-inch, Early 2011) running OS X El Capitan 10.11.5 to make the color of screen warmer at night. When I pick my laptop suddenly and Sudden Motion Sensor (SMS) activates, codef.lux/code stops controlling the color suddenly. Sometimes it does not resume its task after SMS stops sensing the motion.  codef.lux/code uses Location Services to detect the time zone and schedule color shift correctly.  According to this SMS parks the head of HDD and unlocks it in stable states so playing video and audio might be paused when the SMS engages. Playing video and audio needs reading from disk but codef.lux/code has no feature to provide working with files or disk.  ul liCan SMS affect Location Service or other running processes in the memory?/li liCan codef.lux/code or other processes have access to the state of SMS in realtime? em[Answered]/em/li /ul  Note: I have installed a SSD in place of Apple HDD and replaced my SuperDrive with a HDD Caddy containing my Apple HDD. But before this, I have this issue on OS X Yosemite.  strongUPDATE/strong: I found the answer of my second question. AMSTracker is a command line SMS monitor that can retrieve orientation values from the sensor in realtime.
