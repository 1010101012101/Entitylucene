How to run diagnostics on iPhone? <body> My iPhone currently has me stumped. It's an iPhone 6 running the latest iOS. I have a Mac running Yosemite and the latest iTunes. I can't figure out what's wrong, so a diagnostic method would be great. I've no access to a genius bar etc.   Initially the wifi indicator stayed grey. Then there seemed to be weird charging issues. Then it had moments of shutting off (once it even came with a blue screen,) but this may be down to the charging.  This all happened within a few hours.   Then it went to charging with only the apple logo. I assumed I was screwed.   A few days later (I was on vacation when all this went down,) I turned it on and it appeared to be working as normal, albeit with the wifi greyed. It allowed me to make a backup, which was nice. I reset the network connections - no joy.  I reset the other settings - no joy.  I had to wait until later to completely restore the phone and by that time I was left with an unresponsive phone never making it beyond the apple logo.   I connected to itunes and got nothing until putting it into DFU mode. iTunes picked it up and I tried a restore. Initially I got error 4013, then tried again and got 4005. I keep getting 4005 and can't get the phone off the "connect to iTunes" screen.   Really don't know where my phone is at, so a diagnostics method would be great.   <comment225020> 4005 & 4013 are USB errors. Try a different cable, different port. Remove all USB Hubs. https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201444
