Keyboard shorcut to switch focus between multiple displays on OS X 10.9.5 + (mavericks, el capitan, sierra) <body> The fact that each monitor acts on its own in OS X Mavericks is pretty cool. However, I find that I have to use my mouse and click on the unfocused monitor before I can actually slide back and forth its screens (or spaces).  What's the keyboard shortcut to switch focus to another monitor?  strongupdate:/strong follow up question  <answer106635> (This should be a comment but I don't have the reputation to post one.)  I have the same issue. I work almost exclusively in full-screen apps and switch between them with kbdctrl/kbd+kbd◀︎/kbd and kbdctrl/kbd+kbd▶︎/kbd. I like to work on my primary monitor and use the secondary for Messages. But I don't want to leave Messages visible when I'm not using it; I would rather switch back to the Desktop on the secondary monitor. But to put focus on the secondary monitor, I have to move the mouse pointer, totally defeating the time and effort savings of using the keyboard shortcut for app switching.  For what it's worth, you don't have to click on anything to change focus to a different monitor. You only need to move your mouse pointer where you want focus.  <answer107283> Best solution I've found thus far is to install the free CatchMouse utility off the app store.  It allows you to assign different keyboard shortcuts to "warp" the mouse pointer to the center of each monitor.  In my case I've mapped my left hand monitor to kbdCtrl/kbd+kbd⎇ Alt/kbd+kbd←/kbd, and the right one to kbdCtrl/kbd+kbd⎇ Alt/kbd+kbd→/kbd.  strongNote: The link to CatchMouse has been updated to an unknown and untrusted source. Download and use at your own risk!/strong  <answer107333> Here's a way that works from the keyboard:  ol liOpen codeSystem Preferences -&gt; Keyboard/code and click the codeShortcuts/code tab./li liChoose codeMission Control/code from the sidebar./li liScroll down until you see Mission Control listed in the main panel; check its box if not checked, and click the disclosure triangle./li liYou should see codeMove left a space/code, codeMove right a space/code, and then a series of codeSwitch to Desktop 1/code, codeSwitch to Desktop 2/code, etc. for as many desktop spaces as you have going at the moment./li liCheck all of the boxes of the codeSwitch to Desktop N/code type./li liIn my prefs, each of those Switch-tos has a shortcut already there - kbdCtrl/kbd-kbd1/kbd, kbdCtrl/kbd-kbd2/kbd, ... kbdCtrl/kbd-N, where N is the Desktop number (Control key is shown as a carat ('^'). You can assign whatever you want to these, but keeping them in a sequential scheme helps, so I suggest leaving them as is./li liNow, you can switch among your functioning desktops (aka Spaces), and if one you choose is on the other display, focus will shift to that display. /li liIf you don't remember which number a Desktop is, you could first use your shortcut for Mission Control itself (mine is kbd⌥ Opt/kbd-kbdUp Arrow/kbd, which I think was the default, but again you can set that for whatever you want). You'll see your current numbered Desktops, and can then use the appropriate shortcut. Press kbd⎋ Esc/kbd to get out of Mission Control./li liI see that if I have all of the Switch-tos checked, then if I had another Desktop and check keyboard shortcuts again, the new Desktop is added to the Switch-to list and its shortcut is checked as well. So no need to go back to Prefs after the above steps./li /ol  Thanks for stimulating me to poke into this. I was having the same frustration as you and others!  ADDED for El Capitan: In my October 31 2016 note I describe my latest finding for switching to a space in the external display. It seems you need at least two spaces defined on your external display, and then you need to hit Control-N, Control-M, and you will be live in space M, where N &amp; M are space numbers of spaces on the external display.  <answer108153> I use Keyboard Maestro to do just this. I mapped the kbdF16/kbd thru kbdF19/kbd keys in this order.  kbdF16/kbd Left monitor move left  kbdF17/kbd Left monitor move right  kbdF18/kbd Right monitor move left  kbdF19/kbd Right monitor move right  I created 4 Keyboard Maestro Actions for this, one for each monitor and one for each direction. Here is the basic shortcut which gets adjusted accordingly:  ol liMove the mouse over to whichever monitor without clicking./li liKeystroke kbdCtrl/kbd-[left arrow] or [right arrow], depending./li /ol  Actually I changed the Keyboard Shortcut in System Preferences under mission control from:  kbdCtrl/kbd-Arrow to move left/right a space to:  kbdShift/kbd-kbdControl/kbd-kbdOption/kbd-kbdCommand/kbd kbdleft/right arrow/kbd to free up the simpler control arrows for other activities. I also changed the Keyboard Maestro Macro to reflect the change.  While at it I also have the following mission control operations.  kbdF13/kbd Show desktop  kbdF14/kbd Show application windows  kbdF15/kbd Mission Control  I have it set up for the mouse to stay on the changed monitor but it could easily be set to return to where it started from.  <answer116889> sI just found an open source window manager called slate.. From my point of view it's better than strongdivvy/strong and better than strongsizeup/strong.. and it has a key binding for switching focus between screens. Its default key bindings are shown here (very customizable).. it defaults to~  kbd⌘/kbdkbd→/kbd and kbd⌘/kbdkbd←/kbd  strongbonus:/strong here is my slate config file.. it can give you some ideas to get you started/s  h1update/h1  From the comments I realized that my above answer isn't about switching focus, rather it's about throwing windows around from one monitor to another. That's not what the question was about.  This solution works assuming that you already have application windows already open in all your monitors..   Take a look at this screenshot to understand my solution (click on it to zoom):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qVsBt.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  strongscenario 1/strong i simply click on kbd⌘/kbdkbdtab/kbd to switch between the applications (ie i switch from chrome which is on the already focused monitor to terminal which is on the monitor i want to focus on  strongscenario 2/strong I do the same simply by clicking on kbd⌘/kbdkbd`/kbd, this makes me switch between windows of the emsame/em application.. in the example below i got chrome windows in all three monitors, so I simply go through them until I reach the window I want to switch focus to..  <answer275808> Keyboard Maestro can help you do that.   In my case, I use CTRL + 0,1,2 to refer screen 0, 1, 2. Below is how I configure that. Also, 0,1,2 on number pad is close to your arrow keys, then you can use CTRL + arrows to switch windows on selected display.  Notice, I use click because I want to move the focus to the window under cursor.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Gh9cc.png" alt="mouse movement to select display"  <comment125251> yeah the point is to avoid using the mouse all together for such a common and basic operation <comment125291> doesn't really solve the problem because you have to move you hand to your mouse to move the pointer into the other screen to then put you hand back on the keyboard for the Control + Arrow the only people that might profit are Lefties who use the mouse left-handed. best would be a Shift + Control + Arrow to switch between screens. Now to figure a way to get that Macro to work. <comment125328> @Stephan that's exactly what i'm asking about <comment125908> i see the value in what you're saying.. although i still wouldn't consider it ideal. b/c you are using dekstop numbers.. and to go back and forth to a specifically numbered desktop forces you to remember it (having to go through mission control to see the number of a desktop defeats the whole point of a 'shortcut').. the number one rule in human/computer interaction is "don't make me think".. i was hoping for something that's more intiuitive.. like +[ctr] or smtn.. that requires 0 brain memory/processing on the user's part.. but i still gave you a +1 :) <comment125912> after testing with your solution.. it definitely saves time.. but it doesn't address the main problem: **shifting focus**.. b/c even if it shows a screen i'm interested in.. that screen is still not in focus.. and so i still gotta take my hands of the keyboard and put my mouse on that screen.. then move my hands back to my keyboard.. :( <comment126006> Hmmm. If I use the Control-N shortcut described above (where N is the Desktop number), the display I just switched to gets focus if it wasn't the desktop in view on that display. If I press Control N+1, then Control-N, then Desktop N comes into focus. So I DO get to my chosen Desktop & display without leaving keyboard, but it takes an extra keyboard step, and seems to require having that N+1 Desktop available to switch to. Obviously sub-optimal, but it does avoid using the mouse. <comment126888> nice works well! <comment126889> The reason I picked [this](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/107283/43968) answer is b/c it involved the act of switching between screens (ie ctrl +  or ctrl + ) and that in itself guarantees that the screen being switched to gets highlighted.. and it's very intuitive too (ie no numbers involved or intermediate steps) <comment130368> Lazy people can click here, all others need not apply: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/catchmouse/id439700005?mt=12 <comment131659> I gotta add that the suggestion above doesn't do the highlighting in itself.. so what I do is that once the mouse cursor is on the right screen.. i switch between screens using ctr+left or ctrl+right <comment136277> It took me a while to figure out how to get Keyboard Maestro to move the mouse to my laptop monitor, so in case anyone else is having trouble too, I got it working like this:  `just move` at `SCREEN(Internal,MidX)`, `SCREEN(Internal,MidY)` relative to the `absolute position` <comment141914> +1 except for #9. Stays unchecked, so I have to go in the prefs and check it manually for each new desktop added. <comment165453> Hmmm, doesn't seem to be available in the US store currently. <comment181844> How did you get this to work? I've been playing with Slate, but it seems like those commands just give focus to the  next window to the right or left of the current one. Are you able to get it to solve the problem from your original question? <comment187315> yeah it did @shanebonham.. you just have to go through the config file and make sure you're doing the right command <comment187466> CatchMouse is still available from the developer as of 2014-12: http://ftnew.com/catchmouse.html <comment196868> @BruceVanAllen  I have 4 desktops/spaces going but my System Preferences  Keyboard  Shortcuts  Mission Control only shows 'Switch to Desktop 1.'  There aren't any options to switch to Desktop N. Any thoughts?  I'm using Mavericks. <comment261468> Does anyone know where CatchMouse ended up or if there is an alternative? The link on the Mac App Store and the link to the developer in the comments here are all broken. <comment283092> I don't think this exists with slate currently - https://github.com/jigish/slate/issues/458 I would really like to see this as well. <comment288604> @abbood This absolutely doesn't work, it's can change focus between apps but not between monitors, i've tries everything, and i've read the documentation. <comment312411> Thanks for this. Worked out of the box without having to touch the config file or create one. CMD + right arrow/left arrow switches focus between monitors. (NOTE - I'm using two external monitors with the actual laptop closed, in clamshell). None of the above solutions worked for me on OSX El Capitan. <comment313576> I was looking something like this long ago! ..thanks! <comment317904> cmd + tab usually works for me when trying to switch from my laptop to my external monitor. <comment319022> Sorry but I just tried it in El Capitan and it is not working :/ I can not change focus to my external display :/ <comment323631> I can't change focus to my external display too. :( (El Capitan) <comment324656> OK, here's what I've found in El Capitan. (Assumes Sys Prefs:Mission Control: Displays Have Separate Spaces is checked.) 1. In Keyboard: Shortcuts: Mission Control the number of commands for "Switch to Desktop N" seems to be set by how many Desktop Spaces you ALREADY have defined. 2.If you have at least two spaces created on your external display <comment324657> [Previous comment saved too soon.] 1. In Keyboard: Shortcuts: Mission Control the number of commands for "Switch to Desktop N" seems to be set by how many Desktop Spaces you ALREADY have defined. 2.You can see which number a space is by using your Mission Control Hot Corner (set if needed). 3. With at least two spaces created on my external display, say spaces number 3 & 4, this works: I am in the main display, space #1; if I hit Control 3, then Control 4, I am in the external monitor, space 4. Then Control-N to switch among spaces on that display. See if this works for you. <comment337844> Doesn't work for me. Not sure about the "working out of the box" experience. I am on Mac OS Sierra. <comment337847> Not available on our region? Why? :( <comment337848> Doesn't really switch between displays in Mac OS Sierra... <comment337850> It's sad that none of the suggested solutions work for Mac OS Sierra... I think this feature should be built-in the OS. <comment338080> the guys complaining are right.. i updated the answer <comment338081> i updated my [answer](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/116889/43968) below.. hopefully it better addresses the problem <comment346447> This is the best answer, Keyboard Maestro is well developed, is currently supported on Sierra, and has so many powerful options to control the mouse, this is awesome! <comment366622> [This github repo](https://github.com/ROUND/CatchMouse) seems to host it. This is the best solution as of now, in my opinion. July, 2017
