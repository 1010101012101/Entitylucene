Can I restore memories on ios 10? <body> I tried to delete a photo on memories but accidentally delete the whole of memories. Is there a way I can get memories back on IOS 10 if I accidentally deleted it? I have looked through the whole photos app but couldn't find anything to restore it. At the moment when I go to memories it says " No Memories. Memories will appear here when more photos and videos are added to the library.
