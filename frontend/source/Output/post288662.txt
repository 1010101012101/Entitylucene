How to stop OS X 10.11.6 (El Capitan) from using keychain <body> I really despise the keychain "feature" in OS X. I do not want my computer or my browser to know my passwords.   strongHow do I stop keychain from being active completely?/strong   Everything I've looked at discusses how to change your password or make it more accessible, but I want to disable this altogether.  <answer288666> You can remove all passwords stored in Keychain via menu File - Delete Keychain "login". This will create a 'fresh' keychain; you only have to remember emnot/em to store any new passwords in it when the system asks for it.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gPl8R.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  For Safari, open its Preferences and go to the Passwords tab. Uncheck the 'AutoFill user names and passwords' option:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/I6n4e.png" alt="enter image description here"
