Disable "space+shift" in Sublime Text <body> I want to disable the "space+shift" thing in Sublime Text, it creates something that looks exactly like a space unless marked, and it messes upp all my scripts because I always accidentally type it. I was not able to find anything like "space+shift" or "shift+space" inside the sublime-keymap.  <answer219689> On my system I can't reproduce the behavior of Sublime described by the OP. The problem may be related to an interfering third-party app/process.  One possible solution - configuring a new keycode with Karabiner to avoid the problem - is outlined below.  To disable or modify kbdShift/kbdkbdSpace/kbd in Sublime just remap the key combo with Karabiner. Usually you have to define an app in em/Applications/Karabiner.app/Contents/Resources/appdef.xml/em if you want to adjust/modify an app-only shortcut. Since the appdef list already contains emSublime Text/em you can immediately add a new remapping.  ol liDownload, install and open Karabiner/li liOpen in the menulet Karabiner - Preferences/li liOpen the tab emMisc &amp; Uninstall/em/li liHit the button kbdOpen private.xml/kbd/li liOpen the file private.xml with an appropriate editor/li liEnter the customized keycode  Example (kbdShift/kbdkbdSpace/kbd - kbdSpace/kbd):  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;   &lt;item&gt;     &lt;name&gt;Enable at only SUBLIMETEXT&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;item&gt;       &lt;name&gt;Shift+Space to Space&lt;/name&gt;       &lt;identifier&gt;remap.app_sublime_shiftspace2space&lt;/identifier&gt;       &lt;only&gt;SUBLIMETEXT&lt;/only&gt;       &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::SPACE, MODIFIERFLAG_EITHER_LEFT_OR_RIGHT_SHIFT, KeyCode::SPACE&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;/item&gt;   &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre/li liSave the file/li liOpen in the menulet Karabiner - Preferences the tab emChange Key/em/li liHit the ReloadXML button/li liEnable the emSublime Text/em remapping.

Additionally, looking at the file in a hex editor shows it as hex 20 which is nothing more then a space.  That said, this may not be the case in other Language/Region settings, so you might need to provide more information especially what exactly you mean by "and it messes upp all my scripts". <comment265685> Nothing to add to user3439894's comment except that you should add a screenshot of the messed up scripts. <comment265687> I forgot to add I tried  "shift+space" as well as "space+shift" and the results are the same, a space (hex 20) being typed. <comment265689> @klanomath What's interesting about seeing a screenshot of the scripts? Sorry if I didn't explain well, but it looks the exact same but it doesn't work the same. If I want to match a string that's exactly `string `(string+space) and I accidentally pressed that weird character, I will match `string `(string+weird character) and that messes my scripts up. <comment265690> @DisplayName As user3439894 I can't reproduce the behavior of Sublime you describe.  I also get 0x20 as result with the one or the other key(-combo). <comment265692> I typed it and opened it with an hex editor and got "C2 A0".@klanomath <comment265694> @DisplayName I've created a Sublime document with the content *abcd(shift+space)(new-line)abcd(space)(new-line)* and examined the file with Hexfiend. The two lines are identical. <comment265695> For me it appears as "¬†". <comment265696> Are you sure the issue is shift+space? This sounds to me like [alt+space issue](https://coderwall.com/p/myfhmg/dealing-with-alt-space-non-breakable-space-in-sublime-text-2-on-os-x), which inserts a non-breaking space ( which doesn't look entirely identical to normal space ).  As far as I can tell, shift+space just creates a normal space. <comment265702> @Joonas maybe alt+space has, for some reason, been remapped to shift+space? But yeah, I followed that guide and replace alt+space with shift+space and the issue is fixed now. If you want to, you could add that as an answer and I would accept it. <comment265713> You can answer it youself, if you want to.
