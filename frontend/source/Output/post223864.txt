How to show "time until next scheduled calender" event (in menu bar) <body> Is there a way to show emtime remaining until next calendar event/em? Preferably in the menu menu bar if possible?

I can see in the code that you excluded `'Birthdays'`, I tried excluding `'Week #s'`, along with a range of other calendars, with more `-ec`â€™s, but couldn't get it to work (again). Is there a way to inverse the process such that I only select my `Main` calendar and exclude everything else?
