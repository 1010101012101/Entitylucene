How can I increase java heap size on my Mac running PS3 Media Server? <body> i've some issues running ps3 media server on my MacBook Pro 13" on OS 10.8.3.  When I want to play a MKV on my xbox throught PS3 MS, no matter which movie I try, it plays only for 10s then the java player crashes.   By searching, I learned that it came from a lack of Java Heap size so i tried to increase it but i didn't succeed.   Where can I learn (or can you provide details) on how to increase the heap size for a specific app running under Java 7 man 17?  <comment103220> How did you try to increase the heap size?
