How to sync an additional folder to iCloud Drive similar to how macOS Sierra does it? <body> I want to add my Downloads folder to my iCloud Drive so that it can sync just like Sierra syncs with the Documents and Desktop folder.  Can this be done?  <answer270251> You could create an 'Alias' of your 'Downloads' folder and move it to iCloud Drive.   To do this:  ul liLaunch Finder and locate your 'Downloads' folder/li liRight-click on your 'Downloads' folder and select 'Make Alias'/li liDrag the new alias to 'iCloud Drive' in the Finder sidebar (You'll notice the animated pie graph icon filling up to the right of 'iCloud Drive' in the Finder window as it syncs)/li /ul  You can now remove the word 'Alias' from the name of the folder in iCloud drive if you'd like. There is no real technical reason for it to be there other than to remind you that it's an alias and not the original folder.  <comment339593> Look into symbolic links. <comment340148> This only uploads the alias file to iCloud Drive and not the contents of my Downloads folder. :/ <comment340161> @TreS I just tried my steps again in case I missed something and it's working perfectly for me. It's uploaded all contents of my Downloads folder including all sub-folders. I even went as far as to download a few new files to test and everything new that I download immediately syncs with the Downloads folder alias in iCloud Drive as well. What is the exact version of macOS Sierra that you are running? <comment369965> I do confirm @TreS is correct. Only the alias but the contents is uploaded.
