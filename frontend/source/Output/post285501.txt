Is there a way to reload/refresh iOS browser and scroll down when visiting a website? <body> I have a website that I visit which updates every few seconds at certain times of the day. I need to see all of the new updates and be able to scroll the page down automatically after each refresh. I found a bookmarklet that refreshes the site but it only shows me the top row of updates. I need it to scroll down as well to load all of the updates.
