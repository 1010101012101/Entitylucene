Re-arrange items in checklist in Notes 4 app in El Capitan <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mAUgR.png" alt="enter image description here"  The Notes 4 app bundled with El Capitan is revamped. It now includes a checklist feature. This feature becomes available after you agree to "upgrade" (convert) your existing data.  strongIs there some way to re-order the items in a checklist?/strong   I tried dragging, but I cannot find any thing on which to click to initiate the drag. I looked at the context menu, but no such item. The main menus offer a codeFormat/code  codeMark as Checked/code item, but nothing about moving items.  <answer213123> Unfortunately, there is no real functionality for re-ordering checklist items; these strongcannot be rearranged/strong properly through dragging or any other shortcut in the latest version of Notes (emNotes 4.0 on El Capitan/em).  At present, the checklists should be treated like interactive bullet points. They can only be selected and moved around in the same way that text can; I have experimented with the feature thoroughly.  Re-orderable lists can be suggested to Apple via their standard Feedback form.   <answer213125> h3Drag and drop worked for me (OS Version: 10.11.1 (15B42)):/h3  ol liHere is the list/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ibgUE.png" alt="enter image description here"  ol start="2" liSelect the line item that you want to move/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IE1FS.png" alt="enter image description here"  3.Drag it to the new place (using codecmd/code codeclick/code)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8DUSe.png" alt="enter image description here"
