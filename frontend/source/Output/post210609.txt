Using caps lock indicator for other purpose <body> Can I use the caps lock indicator light for another purpose; like indicating that the current keyboard layout is Greek?  <answer211790> It looks like Karabiner + Seil can get you that.  The starting point: is the “Change CapsLock Key” on this page: https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/list.html.en.  <comment259061> Neither of the programs can control Caps Lock *light*. Their purpose is to  remap Caps Lock key to another key or key combination.
