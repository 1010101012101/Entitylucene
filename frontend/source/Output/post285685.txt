iCloud not syncing? <body> It seems iCloud stopped to sync from/to Windows. Why?  In Windows I see the following picture: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hxCLz.png" alt="enter image description here"  The iCloud account is running on 1 Macbook, 1 iPad and 1 Windows pc.  I'm waiting for a couple of days already and I see no network traffic indicating something going in/out on Windows.  On Mac/iPad it works. If I create a file/folder on Mac it appears on iPad just after.  I have 15/1 Mbps (down/up) internet connection.  What can I do?  <comment360360> It looks like it's trying to upload 46,000 items, on a 1Mbps internet connection. <comment360368> Is there any problem, besides being slow? As I mentioned, there is no network traffic. <comment360376> Does your iCloud account sync on your Mac and iPad ? According to your question it seems like it doesn't, but it is not pretty clear. <comment360380> Question edited. <comment360381> Ok, and since when does it not work any more? Did you set the 2-step verification recently? <comment360387> I've noted it stopped to work just after I copied a lot of stuff (~5GB) to iCloud on Windows (expecting it to sync to other devices). 2-step verification was set a long time before. There is ~20GB free space in the iCloud account.
