OSX Yosemite My Calendar Icon Stopped Updating <body> Since upgrading to Yosemite, the calendar icon in my dock has been stuck on October 17. I have had no luck getting it to display the correct date.  Has anyone else run into/found a solution for this issue? Its driving me insane.  <answer153762> I restarted the computer and unchecked the "reopen all windows" checkbox, and the issue was resolved when I logged in.  <answer176145> Seems calendar needs to be open to update icon on dock.  <answer218118> This is a little old, but for those still looking for a quick fix:  Open up the terminal and enter the following command:br code'killall Dock'/code    This should reload your dock, including all of the icons thus updating the date displayed in the calendar icon.  <comment207960> Unfortunately, this is only a temporary solution, I have found that the issue comes back a few days later, and can, again, only be fixed with a restart. <comment207961> This is not the case for me, I never quit the calendar app and still have the issue.
