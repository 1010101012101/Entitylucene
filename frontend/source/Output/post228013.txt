False error Undefined property when debug php script in El Capitan <body> I have installed PHP and x-debug from homebrew in El Capitan:  code php -d xdebug.remote_enable=on -v PHP 5.6.18 (cli) (built: Feb  6 2016 06:53:53) Copyright (c) 1997-2016 The PHP Group Zend Engine v2.6.0, Copyright (c) 1998-2016 Zend Technologies     with Xdebug v2.3.3, Copyright (c) 2002-2015, by Derick Rethans     with blackfire v1.9.1, https://blackfire.io, by Blackfireio Inc /code  But, sometimes, I get this error while I'm debugin inside code  code Notice: Undefined property: Wanup\ChannelBundle\Command\CreateConstantsOTACommand::$definition /code  when execute, in this case, the method definition() of CreateConstantsOTACommand.  The Undefined property is always random but always the method name that is executed when crash.  With xdebug disabled the execution is done well.  Googling I read about Thread safe and thread unsafe issues, but I think that homebrew packages will be compiled in the same way.

I installed php,apache and xebug manually. <comment315859> Found this answer on it: http://stackoverflow.com/a/35650055/147949 Though I couldn't get the newest version working on my system for some reason so I couldn't test. <comment315889> I'm working with PHP7 and works well. I supose that bug has been fixed :)
