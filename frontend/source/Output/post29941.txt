How can I modify the Date Added field in iTunes 10 <body> I haven't tried doing this in quite some time (iTunes 7 era), but I seem to remember simply editing the XML file iTunes creates was NOT sufficient in updating the Date Added field in iTunes.  In case you're curious why I would want to edit Date Added, it is because I most often enjoy listening to music with iTunes sorted on Date Added field. Most of the time this is a logical order for me, but occasionally (when importing more than one album at a time) iTunes imports a batch of songs in a seemingly random order, so I might have very differing albums intermixed. In these cases, I'd like to go in and make sure the Date Added times are grouped by album.  <answer29942> The Date Added field is officially read only. AppleScript can't change it, nor can any menu or command within iTunes. iTunes Music Library.xml is a text file, so in theory it could be edited to modify the Date Added information, then force iTunes to rebuild the iTunes Library.itl file. Not particularly easy.  If there's a better solution, I'd love to see it, but I'm afraid Apple made the Date Added field difficult to modify.  <answer76849> You could try sorting by the strongDate Modified/strong field. strongDate Added/strong is readonly, but you can modify strongDate Modified/strong. There's an app called SortHelper for iTunes.  <answer132441> Just change the system clock and add the file again:  ul liRemove the track. /li liChange the date on your system clock to the desired date. /li liAdd the track. /li /ul  <comment39952> This won't work. When iTunes rebuilds the library from the XML file, the date added information is wiped out and replaced with the current date/time. <comment155750> Or he can just change the date in the `iTunes Library.xml` file <comment190731> @SethTisue if that is the case just change the current system date to what you need it to be, then change it back. <comment190759> Huh? How is that helpful? All the information I was trying to save is still wiped out.
