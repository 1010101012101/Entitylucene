Can I use an AppleTV when I travel off my home network? <body> I have a first generation AppleTV and I am wondering if I take it on vacation and connect to an HDTV with an HDMI cable, will it enable me to pickup programming off the WiFi in my vacation are for viewing?  <answer119092> You may have an issue with the hotel wifi.  Oftentimes hotel wifi networks require you to open a web browser to login and use the internet.  The Apple TV doesn't have a web browser so you might not be able to login and use their wifi network.  You might want to bring it along and see if there's a wifi network or hardwired ethernet connection that will work.  <comment138854> Where are you going?  What WiFi do they have? Please can you add more details. <comment139161> See https://discussions.apple.com/message/20517336#20517336
