iPhone Not Syncing Audio Recordings Added to iTunes <body> I made some recordings with the Voice Memos app, something I've done often; then I load the recording into iTunes and throw it in a playlist that does Sync with the phone.  When looking on iTunes, at the phone, the tracks are there. But in opening Apple Music on the phone, the tracks are not.  So what is happening? I've tried multiple Syncs, tried a direct "Add to Device" function, I've "Added to a Playlist" and the Playlist Syncs but the track doesn't.  I tried adding my name and my phone's name as artists to Sync only seems to Sync old recordings up to NEW RECORDING 72d. but I'm on recording 107; so why this selective Sync when I've done everything I can to try to get it to Sync all of them?  This started happening all of a sudden, I've done this before without too much difficulty at all.  <comment325531> What is the file extension on the files you are trying to sync?
