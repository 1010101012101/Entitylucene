El Capitan upgrade fails at late stage, unable to get out of re-try loop <body> I was upgrading my Mid 2009 Mac Book White to El Capitan. It was running on 10.5 (Leopard). Brought 10.6.5 (Snow Leopard), successfully upgraded it. Then from the automatic update, updated it to 10.6.8 and patched up Mac Store to download  10.11 (El Capitan). Downloaded 10.11 via Mac Store and ran the upgrade.  The installation was smooth untill it reached the following error saying that the installation couldn't be completed.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tAZIZ.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  I have started the machine a few times, and by default it boots back to try the install again, and stops in the exact same place.  I ran Disk Utility from the recovery mode to check and fix some issue and reran the installation, but it's still the same.  I have not been in this position with a Mac before, and am not sure what my next steps are:  ol liIs there any safe way out of the installation loop?/li liIf not, is there any way I could connect a USB drive in recovery mode, so I can retrieve some local files before wiping the disk for a complete re-install?/li liAlso is there a guide on reinstalling via a USB Drive on a Mac?/li /ol  <comment356079> What does the log say?  That would be the first step in figuring out what's wrong.
