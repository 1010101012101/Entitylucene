All Yahoo Calendar Entries appear on iPhone a day earlier at 11pm-11pm <body> All Yahoo Calendar Entries appear on my iPhone / iPad a day earlier at 11pm-11pm.br Problem continues on both iPhone5s, updated to iOS 10.1.1, and iPad. (I have both Yahoo and [paid] Yahoo Small Business Accounts.) Reinserting the correct day/time on  iPhone lasts for seconds before the entry reverts to 11pm a day earlier. Fortunately, the Yahoo calendar remains OK, but it is not practical to attend client meetings with an iPhone/Yahoo incompatibility.  <answer261110> Maybe the Yahoo Calendar is currently not compatible with the latest iOS 10.1.1. Just contact Yahoo or Apple support for advice.  You can also try this: Open Settings  Scroll down and tap on “Mail, Contacts, Calendars”  Select iCloud, Yahoo or other account  Switch off then turn on Calendar. Wait for a while, Calendar will show up on iPhone or iPad.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DtUXB.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer261126> It may be a time zone discrepancy.br Check that your Yahoo calendar timezone matches the timezone on your phone. For Hong Kong it should be UTC+08:00 on all devices. iOS devices may be updating your timezone automatically based on location.  To check the timezone on your device go to Settings  General  Date &amp; Time.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Yvjld.png" alt="timezone ios"
