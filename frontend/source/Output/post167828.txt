Remove an erroneous email address from iCal invitee list <body> I would like to remove an erroneous email address from an event's auto-completion list (via codeAdd Invitee/code) in iCal.  OX S' Mail application provides a codeRemove from Previous Recipients List/code option,  accessible from a drop-down menu located at the right edge of an email address:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Bg9qL.png" alt="enter image description here"  Is there a way to do so in iCal?  It is important that the solution doesn't remove my existing calendars or events.
