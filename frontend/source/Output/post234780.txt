Sharing & Permissions has 2 "everyone" entries, OS X 10.10.5 <body> I was doing some stuff with the system administrator to my computer and we are not sure what we did to have this happen but we now have 2 everyone permissions in  nearly every file on my compute. The only thing we did was try to install cocoa pods and give my account the proper permissions to read-write to files application and other files. I am currently trying to run Illustrator and it says I don't have read permissions here eiher.   Edit: also if i change the everybody with a custom perm to no access it says I have read and write again but sometimes it will still say you have custom permissions above the permission area.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SABR3.png" alt="Illustrator error"  and this picture   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NPCT3.png" width="300"  <answer234782> You can use Onyx - [freeware] to check/repair the disk, fix permissions &amp; reset ACLs.    Maintenance tab  permissions, check the box at the top &amp; Execute.  Make sure you get the Yosemite version, they're OS specific.  This will default whatever it is you did to the permissions structure... which looks a bit complex to pick through manually.  <comment287054> Have you tried repairing permissions with Disk Utility? <comment287056> Disk Utility doesn't reset ACLs in the User area, hence my Onyx suggestion.
