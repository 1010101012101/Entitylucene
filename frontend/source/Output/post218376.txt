Cant recover from Time Machine Disk because [UPDATE NEEDED] <body> I have an external drive with a bunch of backups and I want to make a restore from that disk. I've always been able to restore by starting the computer while pressing the option key and selecting the disk, where it would take me to an options panel where I could start the recovery process.  But when I try to access that disk now, It shows me a login page with a user called "[UPDATE NEEDED]". What should I do to pass this step? How can I make this work?  <answer218407> from the answer to a very similar question from 2014:     ul   liLog in into the Mac as administrator./li   liBackup the Mac with Time Machine (optional but recommended)/li   liLaunch System Preferences selecting System Preferences from the Apple menu./li   liClick the Security &amp; Privacy preference pane./li   liClick the FileVault tab./li   liUnlock the pane clicking on the padlock (administrator password required)/li   liDisable FileVault and wait (…about 3hrs with a 250GB no SSD HD)/li   liRestart the Mac (optional but recommended)/li   liGo back the FileVault tab./li   liEnable FileVault and wait (…about 7hrs for me!!!)/li   liRestart the Mac./li   liThe unknown user account will disappear./li   liThis should also now allow you to set automatic login./li   /ul   I assume, if thats the only account listed, it has to be an administrator account.  I know you might not be able or want to back up your drive again, though. So maybe this isnt what youre looking for (though that step is optional).  also heres a discussion on apple.com from 2011 with a similar question and answer. this one may be closer to your scenario as it also doesnt mention any accounts besides the "update needed" account  <comment264013> A picture of the screen would be helpful.
