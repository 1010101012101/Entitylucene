Terminal move cursor with mouse in any way? <body> Is there any way at all to use the mouse cursor to move the cursor in terminal, like click where you want it and press a key to move it there?  This is one of the most annoying things I've ever found using the terminal  I know kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdA/kbd will move to the beginning of the line but sometimes these commands are so long  <answer52427> Try emoption/em-click, that is, click with kbdoption/kbd pressed.  This works on the command line and also in screen editors, such as codevi/code and codenano/code.  emoption/em-click just sends the appropriate escape sequences to move the cursor to anywhere in the terminal screen. (To see this working, try it with codecat/code.)  <comment59981> Didn't know that, wonder if there is a way to make this work in iTerm. <comment59983> @Gerry, ah, finally a feature that Terminal has that iTerm hasn't! <comment60007> @Gerry, see [Option + click in iTerm](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/42825/option-click-in-iterm). <comment243601> This doesn't seem to work for me? Im holding the `option` button and then clicking on a specific position but instead of taking me to that position it will load the previously ran command!? Im using yosemite and a 2015 macbook pro.
