Open a URL in Chrome Canary as incognito <body> I am currently using this Automator AppleScript to create a service to open a URL using Chrome Canary in incognito mode  precodeon run {input}     set theURL to input     if application "Google Chrome Canary" is running then         tell application "Google Chrome Canary" to make new window with properties {mode:"incognito"}     else         do shell script "open -a /Applications/Google\\ Chrome\\ Canary.app --args {URL:theURL} --incognito"     end if      tell application "Google Chrome Canary" to activate end run /code/pre  Google Chrome Canary will launch with a new window, but the URL does not load. What am I missing?  Thank you.  <answer270448> I do not have Google Chrome Canary installed but I do have Google Chrome installed and because you've not shown how codeon run {input}/code is actually receiving its eminput/em, what I'm presenting is being done in AppleScript Editor however you should be able to translate it to your use with Google Chrome Canary in Automator.  The following AppleScript emcode/em examples do what it is you're trying to do albeit in Google Chrome not Google Chrome Canary however change instances of Google Chrome to Google Chrome Canary as applicable and it should work as the examples do work as tested.  This first example uses the codedo shell script/code emcommand/em in the codeelse/code emblock/em:  precodeset theURL to "http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/270413/open-a-url-in-chrome-canary-as-incognito"  if application "Google Chrome" is running then     tell application "Google Chrome"         activate         make new window with properties {mode:"incognito"}         open location theURL     end tell else     do shell script "open -a 'Google Chrome' --args --incognito " &amp; quoted form of theURL end if  tell application "Google Chrome" to activate /code/pre  strongNote:/strong When used in a Run AppleScript emaction/em in Automator you may not need to use codequoted form of/code with codetheURL/code, so the last part of the codedo shell script/code emcommand/em will in that case just be:br code&amp; theURL/code  hr  This second example forgoes the use of the codedo shell script/code emcommand/em in the codeelse/code emblock/em:  precodeset theURL to "http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/270413/open-a-url-in-chrome-canary-as-incognito"  if application "Google Chrome" is running then     tell application "Google Chrome"         activate         make new window with properties {mode:"incognito"}         open location theURL     end tell else     tell application "Google Chrome"         activate         -- close window 1   # Uncomment this line if you want the normal window that opens first to be closed.         make new window with properties {mode:"incognito"}         open location theURL     end tell end if /code/pre
