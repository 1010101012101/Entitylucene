Stream iPhone screen to Mac for free? <body> Is there a free way to stream my iPhone's screen to my Mac? I'm well aware of AirServer and Reflector, but I need a free solution that I can leave open for long periods of time, which is why I don't just use the free trial of Reflector.  <comment166094> There must be some way to do this for free, even if I have to make it myself.
