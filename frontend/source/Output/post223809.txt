VirtualBox VERR_NOT_SUPPORTED opening Windows 10 partition/vmdk <body> I'm trying to virtualize my physical Boot Camp partition, so I can do small Windows tasks from Mac without restarting. I followed mostly this tutorial but also read others.  But now when I try to launch the VM it prompts this: codeVD: error VERR_NOT_SUPPORTED opening image file/code  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6wQdl.png" alt="enter image description here"  Any idea what could I try?  <answer223818> This was (or obviously still is in VirtualBox 5?) a known bug of VirtualBox 3 which should have been fixed in strongem4.0.0/em/strong!

Then suddenly my VMs stopped booting. Problem persisted through a subsequent VirtualBox upgrade from 4 to 5â€”but this workaround solved it: thanks!
