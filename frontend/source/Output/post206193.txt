How do I change the password on a Time Machine backup image? <body> I've tried using Disk Utility, but after entering the current password, I get a small dialog reading codeUnable to change password for “$image.” (Inappropriate ioctl for device)/code. I've also tried codehdiutil chpass $image/code, which doesn't give me any errors, but results in both the old password and the new password working (I can codehdiutil attach/code the image using either).  <comment262042> In lieu of an answer, I've decided to simply start a new backup image and abandon this one. I've run `hdiutil erasekeys` on the old sparsebundle, followed by `shred` on all of its metadata files: that should be enough to prevent any data from being recovered even if the password is discovered later.
