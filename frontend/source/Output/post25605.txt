How can I stop my whole screen from flashing white on errors? <body> Whenever I access Terminal and press kbdCommand ⌘/kbd + kbdDelete ⌫/kbd my screen flashes white.  It also happens when Chrome's kbdCommand ⌘/kbd + kbdF/kbd returns no results.  Have I somehow messed up my settings?  I already verified that codeUniversal Access/code » codeHearing/code » codeFlash the screen when an alert sound occurs/code was unchecked. I've tried toggling the setting and still get the flash animation.  <answer25607> This sounds ridiculously simple, but it has worked for me in the past. Try checking and then unchecking codeUniversal Access/code » codeHearing/code » codeFlash the screen when an alert sound occurs/code -- this really sounds like that is the behavior in question, and sometimes setting it and the unsetting it resets to the desired behavior.  This basically checks that the preference file can be written to have a no then a yes and will clear up all sorts of minor issues in how apps can store preferences. The next step is to delete (or move to the desktop) the preference file for the affected application. In this case, the system stores this flash preference here:  code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.universalaccess.plist/code  At this point, you might need to expand to see if rebooting, trying a new user account helps isolate the issue.  <answer52598> Restart. This happens to me periodically. Restarting always fixes it.  <answer54881> precoderm -f ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.universalaccess.plist /code/pre  This will fix it every time.  Maybe someday apple will fix the bug that keeps corrupting codecom.apple.universalaccess.plist/code.  <answer122412> Could have to do with your audio alert set-up. This worked for me in OS X Mavericks. Under apple  preferences  assessability  audio: uncheck "Flash the screen when an alert sound occurs".  <answer139466> You can turn it off in System Preferences  Accessibility  Audio  Flash screen  <answer154567> Checking and then unchecking Universal Access » Hearing » Flash the screen when an alert sound occurs works pretty well. Seems there is some bug. Apple need to solve this issue.  <answer170723> Uncheck the 'visual bell' box in the preferences for your terminal style.  Terminals-Preferences-Profiles-Advanced:  Bell: Audible bell Visual bell &lt;  <answer215308> As discovered by corwin.amber in another post, the problem sometimes lies with a dead coreaudiod and can be fixed with:  precodesudo killall coreaudiod /code/pre  <answer221276> Reposting here from another post as suggested by David Wolever.   In a similar situation, I was about to give up and reboot, but then I found that restarting the strongaudio/strong daemon resolves the issue:  precodesudo killall coreaudiod /code/pre  The symptom was: in the "Sound Effects" system setting panel, selecting alert sounds didn't do anything (usually it triggers a preview of the selected effect). My guess is that OS X fails to play an alert sound, and falls back to the visual cue.  <comment29005> Some things you can do to try and isolate the issue is reboot in safe mode (shift key) to test. Also make a new user and log out of the broken user and into the new user to see if it's something local to your account. Good luck hunting this down. If you do - go ahead and answer it with what you found. It might be something unique that we can't reproduce well. <comment29006> Restarted. It works now lol. <comment29126> @carlos, if the answer helps, please mark it as accepted so others can benefit. <comment49567> I am having the same problem. I think it's an issue to do with the alert sounds. If you go to the Sound  Sound Effects menu, and click on any of the alert sounds, nothing plays. The Universal Access panel knows that you're not hearing anything so resorts to flashing the screen as an override. I think this is something to do with SoundFlower as I uninstalled that just before this problem began manifesting itself. <comment124458> OS X 10.8.5 does not have a ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.universalaccess.plist. Is there an equivalent file of another name? <comment124564> I wanted to enable the screen flashing on bell on this work Mac, but couldn't remember how I've enabled it in the past. So even though this post is asking the opposite question, it still answered mine. Have an upvote! <comment142862> Welcome to Ask Different! This is a [duplicate answer](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/25607/) but with a different way of accessing the option in a newer version of OS X.

I personally use the DisplayPort for my audio out to a sound system hooked up through my monitor, and have seen this issue. <comment298710> As someone above had put it, I had this exact same behavior "If you go to the Sound  Sound Effects menu, and click on any of the alert sounds, nothing plays. The Universal Access panel knows that you're not hearing anything so resorts to flashing the screen as an override."  And that killall did the trick for me! And fixed the alert in the pane as well! <comment320069> Restarting fixes this for me intermittently.
