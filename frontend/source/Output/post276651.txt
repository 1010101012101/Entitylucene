File launches in Launchctl with PID - Status 1 <body> I have a Python program that writes to the /etc/hosts file. It works correctly manually entered using the sudo command. I want it to open automatically. I can load it into sudo launchctl but it returns PID - Status 1.   How do I fix this?    <answer276658> PID - Status 1 means that the process doesn't have enough privileges to access some files (presumably /etc/hosts). To be able to execute script as root, you need to move the loader to code/Library/LaunchDaemons/code or code/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/code   (processes in code/Library/LaunchAgents//code or code~/Library/LaunchAgents//code are run as current user so they don't have root rights).   <comment348254> Please add a link to the python app/script/py file!
