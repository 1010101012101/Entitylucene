How to add wallpapers to iOS 7? <body> How can I add wallpapers to iOS 7 without adding them to Photos.app ?  Is there a way to add wallpapers to native iOS wallpapers?  <answer102970> h1No :(/h1  The list of Apple wallpapers in strongSettings/strong → strongWallpapers &amp; Brightness/strong → strongChoose Wallpaper/strong → strongApple Wallpaper/strong → strongDynamic/strong or strongStills/strong is not customisable by the user, without jailbreaking.  If you want a separate list of wallpapers, you can create an album in the Photos app, add your wallpapers to that album, then open that wallpaper in the strongChoose Wallpaper/strong → strongPhotos/strong list.  <answer102971> No. The only (non-jailbreak) way to add wallpaper is by selecting it from a photo album or Photostream.   However, once you have chosen the wallpaper and/or lock screen, you can delete the image from your Photo collection.   <comment121183> Short answer is no, at least not without jailbreaking.
