Can I pair an iPhone6 running 9.3.5 with an iMac using 10.9.5? <body> I've been trying desperately to pair my iPhone 6 which is running iOS 9.3.5 with my 27 inch iMac (late 2009) running 10.9.5 with no success. I have tried turning Bluetooth on and off on both devices, and was able to get the pairing code to show up each time, however when I click on the computer name the iPhone message says:  "strongConnection Unsuccessful- Make sure the computer is turned on and in range/strong".  or it says:  "strongConnection Unsuccessful- "Username iMac" is not supported/strong"  It should be noted that on the computer the iPhone is showing up in the Bluetooth drop-down menu from the top right. Also, it shows up in the Bluetooth preferences, but goes back and forth from being paired, and not connected.   <answer254016> As stated in this article, many older Apple machines, and specifically the hardware specified in the question, have no Bluetooth 4 support.    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/B9Qsz.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  The information on that site provides links not only to iMacs, but most Apple machines.   <answer254128> It is not supported to pair an iPhone and a Mac via Bluetooth and use the either of one as a Bluetooth speaker/receiver. Both are in simple terms in the wrong device class  But you could use a third party tool to make your Mac an Airplay receiver. The one solution I found was AirServer. Start this tool on your Mac and it should show up on your iPhone as an Airplay destination.  <comment314938> What about trying to connect from the Mac side? <comment314939> @Brick see last paragraph.  <comment314940> Ok. Sorry, didn't read. <comment315681> Why are you trying to pair them? <comment315682> @Harv   to share audio from the phone to the computer. <comment315857> Why not just update? <comment315861> @JMY1000 I have dozens of reasons not to update. My question was about whether these two devices are in fact capable of being paired. <comment315863> If it's only for a limited time, would creating a bootable volume of a newer version be a reasonable solution to the issue? I personally don't know why the issue is occurring or how to fix it, but there might be a workaround. <comment315906> it seems that this model of computer is not compatible with bluetooth 4 - https://eshop.macsales.com/guides/Mac_OS_X_Compatibility
