What to do before you change your Apple ID? <body> I have an apple ID in A country, and now I get a apple ID in B country. I am about to switch to the second apple ID. Switching ID may potentially cause problems, like data loss, information loss and etc.  I have noticed that the manual written by Apple discussed: What to do strongafter/strong you change your Apple ID.  I am asking: Apple ID: What to do strongBEFORE/strong you change your Apple ID, in order to protect the data, and transfer safely and seamlessly.  <comment165880> Protect what data? What are you worried about losing exactly? <comment165940> Like contacts, photos.
