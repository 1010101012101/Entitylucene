How to enable autocomplete for SpriteKit in XCode 5.1.1? <body> I am playing around with SpriteKit framework in XCode 5.1.1 and there doesn't seem to be any autocomplete for properties. (zRotation, position etc..)  I checked for new documentation and there doesn't seem to be any new documents.   I find it difficult to learn when autocomplete isn't working. It works for other frameworks and general autocompletes (CGRectMake etc..)  Check out the below image. I am trying to autocomplete to the 'position' property, but it doesn't show up.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XDBGz.png" alt="enter image description here"  And again here trying to type out the "zRotation":  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/91VWy.png" alt="enter image description here"  Any thoughts on what I may have to rebuild or reload?  <comment151017> As written it's borderline ontopic because it's about how to use Xcode and not about about software development per se. Let's see whether somebody has a an answer for you. If not we can help you in moving the question to another site on the SE network where more developers hang out.
