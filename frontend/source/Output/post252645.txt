Mac (Yosemite 10.10.5) cannot connect to Server on local LAN <body> A Mac (OSX 10.10.5) can't connect to server1 on local LAN (10.1.1.0/24). It can connect (PING) and SSH to other nodes (server2) on the local network without issues.  precodearp -a server1 (10.1.1.10) at fc:aa:14:2b:b1:5b on en1 ifscope [ethernet]&lt;br&gt; server2 (10.1.1.1) at 44:94:fc:28:53:ce on en1 ifscope [ethernet] /code/pre  tcpdump (on server1) shows response packets back to the Mac, however the Mac is not responding to those packets.  I have stopped the firewall on the Mac and server1 (CentOS 6) with no effect. Strange thing is server1 can connect to the mac via SSH and can PING.   Whilst server1 was connected to Mac via ssh, I tried connecting to server1 from the Mac via ssh or ping .. still no good to verify ARP issues.  The above scenario is when both nodes are connected via a 4 port switch/router. The Mac can successfully connect to the server1 when on connected via separate uplink switch, connected to the router and the Mac is on a different network(192.168.1.0/24)  This is driving me nuts ... any help/pointers appreciated.
