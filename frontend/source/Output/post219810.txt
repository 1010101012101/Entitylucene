Cannot set Finder window background colour / image <body> I have created a folder inside HDUsersUsername (the folder where default things like Pictures, Movies, Sites, Documents etc. are) and I'd like to change the background image. The only thing is, the option is greyed-out in View Options.  Some info -   2009 MacBook Pro, Yosemite 10.10.4  [Seemingly] every other folder (including all default folders) (I haven't tested EVERY folder, obviously) can be changed.  I haven't changed anything in the folder's preferences etc. The only thing different is that a folder within this folder has a custom folder icon image.  The folders within this folder also cannot have their BGs changed.  I have tried restarting computer &amp; relaunching Finder, to no avail.  Have I changed an option somewhere without realising? I have looked all over but no one seems to have had the same issue.   Thanks in advance.  <answer219943> I'd go for the standard toolkit first...  ul liIn Disk Utility, "Verify Disk Permissions" and if necessary "Fix Disk Permissions".  Also "Verify Disk" and if necessary "Repair Disk"./li liReset Home folder permissions &amp; ACLs using OnyX  - Maintenance tab/permissions, tick the box at the top then Execute./li liUpdate to 10.10.5 using the 10.10.5 combo update, not the delta from App Store/li /ul  <answer219955> Okay, so I just found a work around instead of a solution..   Made a new folder, changed background image and dragged everything over..   Thanks for the suggestion, I'm sure it would have worked but it seemed like a lot to try just to change the background on a folder.. A pretty pointless thing anyway really!  <comment266452> You should run my three suggestions anyway. Your issue implies deeper problems.
