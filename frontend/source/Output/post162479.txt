Paint.NET alternative for Mac OS X <body> I would be extremely grateful to anyone pointing me in the direction of the Mac OS X analogue for the free Windows image-editing software Paint.NET.  Basically the way I use it is I take lots of screenshots for work, then put arrows in there, some ovals and text - it's all for documentation purposes - mainly for Confluence.  The feature I can't live without is the arrows - they have points where you can easily curve them creating a very good visual e.g. for tutorials.  And of course it's great that you can do all of that in a lightweight app, couple of clicks manner.  <answer162482> You should try Skitch. It does exactly what you want, take screenshot, put arrows, etc.     Get your point across with fewer words using annotation, shapes and sketches, so that your ideas become reality faster.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aVuWz.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer162483> You can use builtin strongPreview.app/strong for adding arrows, shapes, text, magnifying glass etc. It's not as lightweight as strongSkitch/strong mentioned by @jherran, but does the job You need.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/A93xa.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer162594> Gimp is a  nice alternative. While it is a bit more complicated it can do a ton more  <answer162612>    Pinta is a free, open source drawing/editing program modeled after   Paint.NET. Its goal is to provide users with a simple yet powerful way   to draw and manipulate images on Linux, Mac, and Windows.   http://pinta-project.com/  <answer162684> Preview is quite lightweight, in terms of start up time. Plus, in OS X 10.10 Yosemite, you can use the markup that are part of Preview.app from within Mail.app (as soon as you have the Markup extension enabled (see System Preferences  Extensions  Actions).  Depending on the way you want to create your snapshots (i.e., for instance, including menus and the mouse), you might want to consider Grab.app.  If the normal screenshot options, or those available through Grab.app are not good enough, then using Skitch might be more your thing.  One final recommendation: if you use Google Drive instead of Dropbox (but they are working on Dropbox integration, too), Marqueed (https://www.marqueed.com) is an online tool for image annotation.  <answer162892> You can use TechSmith Snagit:  ul linon-free/li liMac OS X / Windows/li liProvide many kinds of annotations for screenshots:/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gw2cx.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer197966> PixelMator Is an amazing alternative  <answer199902> Although expensive, Napkin is purpose built for these tasks.  <answer222569> You could try Patina, which is free in the Mac App Store. It's very polished and has high ratings.  Improved answer:  ul liPatina has a very simple interface that makes the learning curve very short./li liPatina gives the user a lot of control by allowing the user to turn on and off certain features, such as anti-aliasing and interpolation (for the latter one, not yet at the time of writing this but very soon and most likely already by the time most people are reading this post)./li liOther features include continuous object rotation (not limited to 45 or 90 degrees), transparent image saving, a slider for controlling tool width thickness, and alpha blending of colors. /li /ul  <comment190149> GIMP is actually a massive pain in the ass. They're looking for a Paint.NET alternative, and that is a very, very simple program. <comment190150> I know I used to use it before getting a Mac and switching to gimp. It does have a learning curve but you can do some neat things. It can do things paint.net can do thus making it an alternative. <comment190151> "Alternative" implies "similar". GIMP is nothing like Paint.NET. <comment190192> Nice use of Preview to create an image demonstrating Preview. <comment190193> @Robin We need to go deeper ;) <comment190414> I use monosnap. Works great. <comment190954> Thanks for the tip about Pinta! It's looking very promising, is it in active development? Still missing a few primary features important for me, e.g. arrows. I couldn't paste image selection copied from Preview - was getting an error that no image was detected in the clipboard. Will look again at it after a while. <comment190973> you may want to look at the versión 1.5 available here :https://github.com/PintaProject/Pinta/releases/tag/1.5 <comment205665> The moment I select the shape, Preview annoyingly insert a default shape in the middle of the screen and then I have to resize and move the shape. This is counter-intuitive compared to other image editing programs - I drag and drop to create the shape. Also, I can't delete the shape I wrongly created! <comment205675> @eric You can delete the shapes. Select them and hit Backspace (`⌫`). <comment236769> Why is it? and where do you get it from <comment240802> He could also just use Preview.app to add some of these things too (not as complete as Paint.NET, but well...) <comment256313> http://pixelmator.com comment length filler <comment269750> It would be nice if you added some details about the similarities and differences, and generally why to use it. High Ratings and **Polished** are opinion-based, rather than factually based <comment271992> Patina is the best paint.net alternative I've seen. Thanks for this. <comment278233> I'd also recommend GIMP. You'll learn a powerful application which you can then use everywhere - Windows / OSX / Linux. I have switched from Paint.NET to GIMP myself and didn't regret, especially for portability reasons. <comment292669> FYI: Pinta requires Mono for OS X. <comment292683> Patina is a really great paint.net alternative. While it isn't free any longer, the price is extremely low. <comment328136> How difficult is drawing a straight line in gimp? I am trying from last 30 minutes. Waste of time. <comment334377> On Preview you can't even do File  New... I want to create a blank canvas to paste and arrange screenshots and I just can't. <comment334392> @dialex strange, when I have some graphics already in the Clipboard I do have an option `New from Clipboard ⌘N`. <comment334422> I also have that option, greyed out. But I don't have it on my clipboard, I want to create a new empty image with custom dimensions, that's the point. <comment361130> This seems like a sales pitch for the $30 product. Because the original question referred to a free program, you probably should have mentioned this one cost $$.
