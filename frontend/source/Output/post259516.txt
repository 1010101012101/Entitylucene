iMac OS X El Capitan crashing while playing World of Warcraft <body> I have suffered several crashes playing World of Warcraft. The video starts pixelating then my computer crashes and turns off.  I looked for info on video driver updates, seems unless you have some after market video, you will get all updates bundled with their single update.  Your advice is greatly appreciated!  <comment324713> Welcome to Ask Different.
