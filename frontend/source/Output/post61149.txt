What apps can view crash reports on iOS? <body> It's cumbersome to sync with iTunes to get a crash report. I'm looking for an app that can view and copy/paste or email crash reports from any other app on my iPhone. I want to see the full stack trace from the crash.  Is there an app for that?  <answer61490> Since iOS 5, you can do this straight from the Settings App. It's located at codeSettings &gt; General &gt; About &gt; Diagnostics &amp; Usage &gt; Diagnostics &amp; Usage Data/code.  <comment71064> Awesome! Thanks! <comment157435> In iOS 6, tap and hold in a crash report would present a Select All option. In iOS 7, Select All isn't there. If you know how to select all in iOS 7 or later, please comment with a solution. Thanks!
