How do you remove SSL certificate exceptions on OS X? <body> When connecting to a URL via HTTPS and the SSL certificate doesn't match (such as at a paid Wi-Fi hotspot), Safari shows a dialog asking whether the certificate should be accepted. If you accept the certificate, OS X adds an SSL exception and will never ask about that certificate again.  The question is, where is that exception stored? And how can I get rid of it?  Note that this question is essentially the OS X version of “How do you remove SSL certificate exceptions on iOS?”, however the iOS answers make no sense for OS X.  <answer220099> The exceptions are stored in Keychain Access. The certificate will be copied there, together with the trust settings. Double-click a certificate and you will be able to change it's settings. Note: you can have trust setting on system level and user level! They have separate keychains as listed in the sidebar.  <comment311903> Thanks John. Do you know if deleting immediately makes a certificate stop working or does it require a restart? I'm testing the quality of our SSL certificates in Apple Mail. <comment311938> Deleting or changing the trust settings take effect immediately.
