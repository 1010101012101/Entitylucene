Is it possible to use a gesture to go back in Finder? <body> I miss the ability to go back to previous directory via a gesture (swipe with two finger right like in Safari or Chrome) in Finder. Is it possible to enable it?  emEdit: I'm on a MacBook Pro, and using the trackpad./em  <answer33004> With BetterTouchTool, (almost) everything is possible! :) You can, for any application, map a gesture to a keyboard shortcut. You will then be able to attach Cmd+[ to the two finger left swipe gesture.  <answer33008> strongemUPDATE/em/strong  delemIt looks like this has been broken in Mac OS X 10.9 (and wasn't fixed in 10.9.1)/em/del  This works again in the latest Mac Os X 10.10.1, and presumably also in 10.10.  strongTrackpad/strong Three-finger swipe left goes back and forth in Finder, just like in Safari.  You don't need 3rd party software to do this, simply make sure your settings are correct.  Go to codeSystem Preferences/code via Spotlight or Launchpad, navigate to codeTrackpad/code and click the tab codeMore Gestures/code. The first option is "Swipe between pages", which enables swiping in Finder, Chrome etc. Make sure to choose one of the two codeSwipe/code options.  I've attached an image showing the screen for you here: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bVoUc.png" alt="Swipe between pages"  Make sure that you've chosen codeSwipe left or right with four fingers/code in the codeSwipe between full-screen apps/code so the two options don't overrule each other. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Xm4EM.png" alt="Swipe between full-screen apps"  You also want to make sure there is no checkmark in the codeThree finger drag/code. They are mutually exclusive. You can check this in the codePoint &amp; Click/code tab. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YvGCR.png" alt="Three finger drag"   strongMagic Mouse/strong If you use a Magic Mouse and want to be able to swipe back and forth in Finder, you have to turn off the codeSwipe between full-screen apps/code and change codeSwipe between pages/code to either codeSwipe left or right with two fingers/code or codeSwipe left or right with one or two fingers/code (both options enables you to swipe back and forth in Finder when using emboth/em fingers. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AhfRq.png" alt="Swipe back and forth with Magic Mouse in Finder"  <comment37724> That may work for a trackpad, but I can't get it to work with a magic mouse.  `Swipe Between Pages` option, which uses just one finger (no option for 3-finger gesture), allows for gestures in Safari, Preview, etc, but not in Finder. <comment37750> I'm updating the answer to provide more information, which might resolve your problem.  @cm2: The question didn't mention whether it was with a trackpad or a magic mouse. <comment37753> Upvoted as there is no need for a down vote, a comment with a future edit will do. <comment37755> This doesn't work for me on Lion. <comment37767> OK, I got it working. The reason it didn't work in my test was because the Finder window need to have focus and there is no visual feedback until the directory change (while there is feedback in Safari for example). Thank you, response accepted. <comment37777> @MatiasVad: Correct, but I was just adding more feedback to make it more general :).  Nice answer. <comment132162> It looks like this is broken in Mac OS 10.9 (Mavericks) <comment133935> @recklesscoder is, unfortunately, seems you are right. I just tested in the latest update 10.9.1, and it is still broken. I've updated the answer accordingly. <comment359402> Still works in 10.12.5. Great answer, very detailed :)
