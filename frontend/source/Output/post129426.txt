WLAN USB adapter and 802.1X <body> I've recently bought a WLAN USB adapter for my Mac: strongEDUP EP-N8508/strong with chipset Realtek strongRTL8188CUS/strong.  It works perfectly with WEP and WPA/WPA2 hotspots, but I can't make it work with 802.1X. That protocol is supported by the chipset (in fact, it's working in Windows) but on OS X there's no option for that in the Wireless Network Utility.   I tried installing codewpa_supplicant/code on OS X with no luck, since it's not really supported (despite their claims) and it doesn't compile. Well, with some edits it does compile but it doesn't work.   Does anyone know any way to solve/work this around?
