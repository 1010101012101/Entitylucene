Unable to copy OSX Installer from external drive to Mac <body> As usual I wanted to prepare bootable USB with OSX. Some time ago I've made a copy of my Mavericks, Yosemite and El Capitan to external drive.  I wanted simply to drag &amp; drop El Capitan to prepare USB drive.  After dragging El Capitan app file to desktop I get  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/C3LIM.png" alt="enter image description here"  The point is, that my codeDesktop/code does not contain this file. What's wrong? The same happens to all 3 files. I cannot copy them. Are those files corrupted? In a meanwhile I'm downloading new file form App store...  This disk was plugged into Windows multiple times. Is it possible that Windows damaged strongapp/strong files? I've noticed that Windows treats codeapp/code files as folders so maybe it changed the content?  <answer217417> This is a known bug in the Finder app of OSX. Options you can try :   ul liInstead of drag-dropping you can try right click - Copy Item and then paste it on the desktop/li liTry copying the files through terminal command./li liTry making a folder on the desktop, and then copy the files in the newly created folder./li /ul  Reference : Apple Discussions.  <answer217428> I tried Terminal even as the first option but strongno luck/strong in my codeiTerm/code. Then I tried all combinations with dragging and dropping and right click copy and paste. Nothing worked.  Finally I went level up and dragged and dropped parent folders called codeOSX/code. First time it just created empty codeOSX/code directory in my codeDesktop/code with the same error message. But when I did it for the second time, it started copying all 3 big installers.  It's absolutely weird. So finally it's done. I'm writing this response from clean, formatted El Capitan.  Up for Shaggy for all efforts!  <comment262828> I'm glad i could help. As i mentioned in the answer, it is a bug in the Finder and it's behavior is totally random. Please consider accepting it if it helped you. <comment262829> @ShaggyD, you said that this is a well known problem on El Capitan. I see that now it happens with all files I copy form external USB. Can you paste some link to this problem? <comment262869> The problem is not on El Capitan, it's in the Finder app. The link I've given in my answer is the only relevant link that addresses this problem. <comment263763> From your screen capture, it seems that you already have a file (or folder) named "Install OS X El Capitan.app" on your Desktop. The error message seems to be a correct one. <comment263765> This window is from my external USB drive. Not the Desktop. <comment263941> And just below the Finder window of your USB content is the icon of the existing file (or folder) named "Install OS X El Capitan.app" which is on your Desktop.
