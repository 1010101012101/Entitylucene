How to make Airmail to open mailto: protocol link? <body> I have searched for this but I can't find anything in search results answering this query.  When I click on mailto link given in a mail inside Airmail,it opens Mail.app window instead of opening it inside Airmail. On setting gmail account on Mail.app, starts downloading 2GB sized inbox.  <answer226368> I use RCDefaultApp to tweak this type of setting and many other.  Note that while this is an older app nonetheless it still works with OS X 10.11.x too.  It's a Preferences Pane style app and it's freeware. You can read more about it and see screenshots at the web site (linked above).  <answer226373> Open Mail  Preferences  General  Default Email Reader (Select AirMail)  <comment274883> How about this https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201607 ? <comment274954> it works for few seconds immediately after changing it then again it start opening in Mail.app and when I check Prefs, it is Mail as default back again
