What app to use for high res webcam photo capture? <body> Photo Booth does 640x480. I know the HD webcam on the 2011 MacBook Pros can do better than that. What app can I use for taking full resolution stills?  <answer16014> Kinda roundabout, but you could try this:  ol liOpen Quicktime./li liChoose File - New Movie Recording./li liOn the little down arrow to the right of the record button, choose maximum quality.  Also drag the record button holder to least obtrusive location./li liCommand-3 to fit to screen./li liTake screen shots with command-shift-(3 or 4)./li /ol  <answer24761> Photo Booth in Lion does 1080x720 captures in JPEG when the hardware supports it.  <answer24766> Try the free Skitch (also available from the Mac App Store). One of the many things it can do is a Cam Snapshot. To take one, invoke Skitch, then choose Capture  Cam Snapshot. You may need to fiddle a bit with the size of the snapshot to get full resolution.  This worked to the max resolution of the iSight on my older MacBook Pro; it's worth a try on the current models with their FaceTime HD cameras.  <answer126539> Quicky by BlackOp is my choice.  it lets you do lossless webcam video capture.  I then do a frame dump from the video with Quicktime Pro 7  <answer252750> I searched for that too. The best option for me was to use VLC.  ul liOpen VLC/li liType kbdCmd/kbd+kbdR/kbd/li liChoose your camera and the resolution that you want (that your camera is capable of)/li liThen type kbdCmd/kbd+kbdOption/kbd+kbdS/kbd to take a snapshot within VLC (aka your photo)/li /ul  You can also tweak the settings of VLC to chose the name of your output (which can contain variables), and its type (png, jpg, tiff).  <comment17499> Hm. Not a bad hack. Pair it with Grab for hands free pictures. <comment27830> You probably have a newer MBP.
