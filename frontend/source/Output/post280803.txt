I've tried to restart Mac, no luck.

In the Terminal run  precoderm ~/Library/Application\ Support/Dock/*.db; defaults write com.apple.dock ResetLaunchPad -bool true; killall Dock; /code/pre  NOTE: this method will re-arrange all of your launchpad icons. â€“ Martin Zhai  <answer286667> Much easier solution: you have to "long-click", just click and keep it pressed in launchpad. The buttons start to wiggle, the interface is copied from iOS.  <comment353525> The icon still exists after I run this command. :-( <comment353588> Try also running `defaults write com.apple.dock ResetLaunchPad -bool true; killall Dock;` <comment353700> This time the blank icon disappeared. But be careful, **this method will re-arrange all of your launchpad icons**. <comment356203> Thanks for the heads up @Martin Zhai, sorry if that was a pain to rebuild. <comment361970> This works most time, but not for this issue. There is no `x` on the icon after long pressing.
