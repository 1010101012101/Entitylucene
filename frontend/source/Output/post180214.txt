Is it possible to use `tmutil delete` or another command to prune one file from multiple backups? <body> I'm having problems clearing our a backup drive. I want to get rid of a couple large files so I can preserve the other incremental backups.  I can't use the tmutil delete command on entire backups since I'd lose all files from that interval and not just the offending file I want to purge.  here are the permissions for the library package file/folder:  precodeMac:~ bmike$ ls -laeO  /Volumes/Backups/Backups.backupdb/Mac/2015-04-09-072338/Macintosh\ HD/Users/bmike/Pictures/Photos\ Library.photoslibrary  total 0 drwxr-xr-x@ 10 bmike staff  - 340 Apr  8 20:05 .  0: group:everyone deny add_file,delete,add_subdirectory,delete_child,writeattr,writeextattr,chown drwx------@ 28 bmike staff  - 952 Apr  9 09:38 ..  0: group:everyone deny add_file,delete,add_subdirectory,delete_child,writeattr,writeextattr,chown  1: group:everyone deny delete drwxr-xr-x+  2 bmike staff  -  68 Apr  8 09:07 Attachments  0: group:everyone deny add_file,delete,add_subdirectory,delete_child,writeattr,writeextattr,chown drwxr-xr-x+  2 bmike staff  -  68 Apr  8 09:07 Masks  0: group:everyone deny add_file,delete,add_subdirectory,delete_child,writeattr,writeextattr,chown /code/pre  When I use the Time Machine interface, it errors out and I don't know which file or instance has errors:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4Tcpa.png" alt="unhelpful finder error"  I'm looking for a way to delete these protected files from all backup intervals in a similar manner to the Finder Gear icon action of strongDelete All Backups of "Photos Library"/strong   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tW56F.png" alt="Delete All Backups of &quot;Photos Library&quot;"  Is this selective pruning of a file/folder possible across all time intervals with Apple's built in tools, a custom script and/or other tool?  <comment213991> I get the feeling I'm going to have to program this in python - but I'm hopeful someone else has seen or made such a tool already. <comment213995> found this http://philglau.com/script-for-deleting-multiple-backups-from-timemachine/ <comment213997> @Buscarì›ƒ That script won't work - it prunes "all" files before a date which I can do trivially with the Apple supplied `tmutil` command. My php skills are so low, I can't really use that framework to craft a more surgical approach. Perhaps someone with PHP skills could adapt it, though. Thanks
