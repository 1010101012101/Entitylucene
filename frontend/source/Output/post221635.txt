External Hard drive are always read-only, even HFS+ and FAT32 format <body> I am running in to a peculiar problem. I have three external hard drives and a few weeks back, I may have ejected one of them ungracefully. Ever since, they all are getting connected in read-only mode.   I read online that I may have corrupted them (not sure how all three of them) so I bought another external drive to move data off of them for formatting. However, the new drive that I formatted in HFS+ mode is also read-only.   Here is codediskutil info/code on two of them:   precode/ ❯ mount /dev/disk1 on / (hfs, NFS exported, local, journaled) devfs on /dev (devfs, local, nobrowse) map -hosts on /net (autofs, nosuid, automounted, nobrowse) map auto_home on /home (autofs, automounted, nobrowse) /dev/disk2s1 on /Volumes/MEDIA (msdos, local, nodev, nosuid, read-only, noowners) /dev/disk3s2 on /Volumes/Seagate-Backup (hfs, local, nodev, nosuid, read-only) /code/pre    precode/ ❯ diskutil info disk2s1    Device Identifier:        disk2s1    Device Node:              /dev/disk2s1    Part of Whole:            disk2    Device / Media Name:      Untitled 1     Volume Name:              MEDIA     Mounted:                  Yes    Mount Point:              /Volumes/MEDIA     File System Personality:  MS-DOS FAT32    Type (Bundle):            msdos    Name (User Visible):      MS-DOS (FAT32)     Partition Type:           DOS_FAT_32    OS Can Be Installed:      No    Media Type:               Generic    Protocol:                 USB    SMART Status:             Not Supported    Volume UUID:              692180D2-5DED-3077-BCD2-2F543382FDB2     Total Size:               2.0 TB (2000365288448 Bytes) (exactly 3906963454 512-Byte-Units)    Volume Free Space:        1.6 TB (1624557748224 Bytes) (exactly 3172964352 512-Byte-Units)    Device Block Size:        512 Bytes    Allocation Block Size:    32768 Bytes     Read-Only Media:          No    Read-Only Volume:         Yes    Ejectable:                Yes     Whole:                    No    Internal:                 No /code/pre    precode/ ❯ diskutil info disk3s2    Device Identifier:        disk3s2    Device Node:              /dev/disk3s2    Part of Whole:            disk3    Device / Media Name:      Seagate-Backup     Volume Name:              Seagate-Backup     Mounted:                  Yes    Mount Point:              /Volumes/Seagate-Backup     File System Personality:  HFS+    Type (Bundle):            hfs    Name (User Visible):      Mac OS Extended    Owners:                   Enabled     Partition Type:           Apple_HFS    OS Can Be Installed:      No    Media Type:               Generic    Protocol:                 USB    SMART Status:             Not Supported    Volume UUID:              5EA6B3AC-1E26-31F8-90A2-FD96D83D7D2E    Disk / Partition UUID:    218C3E3F-7073-46C0-A069-4CD106AB78B6     Total Size:               2.0 TB (2000054960128 Bytes) (exactly 3906357344 512-Byte-Units)    Volume Free Space:        1.7 TB (1705024344064 Bytes) (exactly 3330125672 512-Byte-Units)    Device Block Size:        512 Bytes    Allocation Block Size:    4096 Bytes     Read-Only Media:          No    Read-Only Volume:         Yes    Ejectable:                Yes     Whole:                    No    Internal:                 No /code/pre  I believe I may have messed something up on my Mac but not sure how to fix it. I strongam able/strong to get these drives to work by first getting them connected as readonly and then running the following command:   precodesudo mount -u -w &lt;/dev/...&gt; &lt;/Volumes/...&gt; /code/pre  But this seems to be unnecessary as they are strongNOT/strong NTFS format.   My Mac details are:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GJYVm.png" alt="Mac system info screenshot"  Would appreciate any info. If there is any details I may have missed, please feel free to leave a comment and I will update the question to add necessary details.   <comment268416> Did you restart your Mac since you ejected and corrupted first external disk? <comment268417> @danielAzuelos Yes, several times infact. I have been trying several small changes like changing groups, permissions etc on my user as well as mount locations. But I don't want to make any more changes unless experts here recommends. :) Also the thing is I just ejected one drive without unmounting but all my external drives (even the new one) is always auto-mounted as read only. <comment268419> Repair your ejected and corrupted first external disk with `Disk Utility`. Don't play with `mount` line command on disks which aren't mounted automatically RW. There might be a good reason for this: protect them against further damage on a corrupted filesystem. <comment268421> @danielAzuelos Agreed. Unfortunately, the repair disk permissions option in Disk Utility is greyed out. I did do repair disk but that didn't yield anything fruitful. <comment268422> To eliminate the possibility you corrupted your system (too many `sudo` with random commands), check your first external disk with `Disk Utility` on a different and *clean* Mac.
