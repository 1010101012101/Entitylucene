iMessage won't work on my MacBook Pro OS X <body> I have a working Apple ID and internet connection but when I tried to login it always says "The server encountered an error processing registration. Please try again later." I've tried resetting PRAM, safe boot, deleting Flash Player data but it still won't work. Any other suggestion on how to fix this?  <comment204877> Try changing your Apple ID password, wait 15 minutes then try logging in again. Do you use iMessage on any other devices?
