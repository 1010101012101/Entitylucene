What are directories /Volumes/Untitled* (Yosemite)? <body> I've just started using a new MacBook Pro, which has Mac OS X 10.10.1 "Yosemite" pre-installed. I was surprised to find paths like code/Volumes/Untitled/code in my code/Volumes/code directory.  precode% ls -ld /Volumes/Untit* d--x--x--x+ 3 root  admin  102 17 Dec 17:10 /Volumes/Untitled d--x--x--x+ 3 root  admin  102 18 Dec 12:34 /Volumes/Untitled 1 d--x--x--x+ 3 root  admin  102 19 Dec 11:44 /Volumes/Untitled 2 d--x--x--x+ 3 root  admin  102 20 Dec 11:45 /Volumes/Untitled 3 d--x--x--x+ 3 root  admin  102 22 Dec 07:17 /Volumes/Untitled 4 d--x--x--x+ 3 root  admin  102 25 Dec 22:23 /Volumes/Untitled 5 d--x--x--x+ 3 root  admin  102 26 Dec 10:41 /Volumes/Untitled 6 /code/pre  Each directory appears to be empty, except for an empty code.Trashes/code subdirectory:  precode% sudo ls -lR /Volumes/Untitled total 0 d-wx-wx-wt@ 2 root  admin  68 17 Dec 17:08 .Trashes  /Volumes/Untitled/.Trashes: /code/pre  I am familiar with entries in code/Volumes/*/code being paths to external storage volumes. I have an external solid-state drive (SSD) mounted, and it has its own named code/Volumes/mySSD/code entry. I have a couple of drives mounted from a file server, and they have their own named code/Volumes/serverA/code etc. entries.  In previous Macs and previous Mac OS X versions, I didn't see entries like code/Volumes/Untitled/code.  The timestamps on the codeUntitled*/code directories are interesting. The first one is from about when I unpacked the new MacBook Pro for the first time. The most recent one is from about when I started up the computer this morning.  If I notice changes in the days ahead, I'll update this question.  I do not see other answers on AskDifferent explaining entries like these. There are answers like Problems creating Yosemite USB bootable drive which mention paths like code/Volumes/Untitled 2/code, but those appear to be paths for actual mounted disk devices that happen to have no volume label.  I also have a query in to Apple Support. If they tell me something useful, I'll post it as an answer.  strongUpdate 1/strong: A few answers to questions, and further details that seem relevant:  strongQ/strong: Can you run mount to see whether/which of these mount points actually point to an existing drive?  strongA/strong: I did so, and got this:  precode% mount /dev/disk1 on / (hfs, local, journaled) devfs on /dev (devfs, local, nobrowse) map -hosts on /net (autofs, nosuid, automounted, nobrowse) map auto_home on /home (autofs, automounted, nobrowse) localhost:/TdCrZmzerGhdW5I605Hbd7 on /Volumes/MobileBackups (mtmfs, nosuid, read-only, nobrowse) //userme@Gemini%28AFP%29._afpovertcp._tcp.local/Qmultimedia on /Volumes/Qmultimedia (afpfs, nodev, nosuid, mounted by userme) //userme@Gemini%28AFP%29._afpovertcp._tcp.local/serverA on /Volumes/serverA (afpfs, nodev, nosuid, mounted by userme) /dev/disk2s1 on /Volumes/mySSD (hfs, local, nodev, nosuid, journaled) /code/pre  strongQ/strong: Do you have a camera card in the slot, or other computers/devices on the network sharing their content? strongA/strong: No camera card. Yes, other devices, as noted above: an external SSD, and a couple of drives mounted from a file server.  Also relevant: the external SSD drive has two partitions. One is HFS+ formatted, and is labelled "mySSD" [exact name changed to preserve privacy]. The other partition is codeext2/code formatted by a Linux system, and as far as I can tell it has no volume label. It's visible from Disk Utility, but doesn't mount as a Mac volume.  The drive is connected by USB to the MacBook Pro.  Also relevant: I used Migration Assistant to bring my environment from a Time Machine backup of an older Mac to this computer. I migrated users, applications, system settings, and other files. Among the software installed on the old computer was strongfuse-ext2/strong 0.0.7, a utility to let Mac OS computers mount ext2 partitions. This software was running on the new computer:   precode% fuse-ext2 --version [...snip...] fuse-ext2 0.0.7 27 - FUSE EXT2FS Driver  Copyright (C) 2008-2009 Alper Akcan &lt;alper.akcan@gmail.com&gt; Copyright (C) 2009 Renzo Davoli &lt;renzo@cs.unibo.it&gt; [...snip...] /code/pre  I also discovered that every time I plugged the external drive into the USB port while the MacBook Pro was running, or every time the computer restarted with the external drive plugged in, a new code/Volumes/Untitled*/code entry appeared.  Finally, I found that fuse-ext2 was writing a log file at code/private/var/log/fuse-ext2_util.log/code. Below are excerpts of the contents. I added line wraps in long lines.

I included a lot of detail in the update so that search engines will index the clues, for future people with this problem.  <answer163700> strongTL;DR/strong: If you see paths like code/Volumes/Untitled*/code piling up, trying mounting and mounting external drives and see if that correlates with more entries appearing.  I diagnosed the problem. It seems that strongfuse-ext2/strong v 0.0.7 was creating the  code/Volumes/Untitled*/code entries when the external SSD was mounted, and was not cleaning them up when the drive was dismounted. Because it failed to clean up, when fuse-ext2 was ready to create a new code/Volumes/Untitled/code entry, it found that there was already an entry with that name, and so added an ever-increasing sequence number to the name.   I uninstalled fuse-ext2, by going to the System Preferences panel, opening the panel for fuse-ext2, and using the uninstall button there.  After uninstalling fuse-ext2, I could remove and add the external SSD, and restart the computer, with no further code/Volumes/Untitled*/code appearing.  The fact that code/Volumes/Untitled*/code entries correlated with new entries appearing was revealing.  The fact that the fuse-ext2 logs mentioned the exact path names in question, and with time stamps similar to the directory time stamps, was good confirmation.  fuse-ext version 0.0.7 dates from 2009-12-24. In the intervening five years, Mac OS has changed a lot. Yosemite, and before it Mavericks, caused a lot of problems for other software. While I don't know why exactly fuse-ext2 creates these entries and doesn't clean them up, it's not surprising that Yosemite causes problems for fuse-ext2 also.  I have deleted the code/Volumes/Untitled*/code from the command line, with no apparent ill effects.  <comment191652> Can you run `mount` to see whether/which of these mount points actually point to an existing drive? <comment191695> I suggest that someone tag this question "fuse" and "ext2". I don't have the reputation yet to do this myself. <comment191709> Do you have a camera card in the slot, or other computers/devices on the network sharing their content? It looks a lot like a DOS-format card was not unmounted properly and the system didn't get a chance to do some cleanup. <comment191851> Thanks for the reputation love! I now have the juice to add the tags myself.
