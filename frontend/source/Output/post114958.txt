In Fullscreen, disable auto-hiding Mac menu bar <body> (on latest Mavericks)  While in VirtualBox (Ubuntu) fullscreen, on a Mac host, each time the mouse goes near the top, the Mac auto-hide menu bar appears - and I want to prevent that, or at least, since it's the annoying component, reduce the time it takes to that menu to disappear when the mouse goes down [currently it's ~1 seconds].  Ideally the time needed to trigger that menu should be higher than currently [instant] - eg like keeping the mouse on top for 1 whole second.  Illustration below shows the Ubuntu menu that has been overridden by the Mac menu when the mouse hits the top of the screen.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3TTKl.png" alt="Ubuntu in VBox fullscreen - mouse hits the top..."   There are already a few questions like this one that are either old or not answered.  Any progress in Maverics, near 2014?  <answer137247> From the parallels forum, but could be a goer?     If you don't want the dock or menu to show up in Mac OS X full screen   then you need to turn on active screen corners and then set the screen   corners to not have any associated action.      (From the menu select "Virtual Machine"  "Configure...". Then select   "Options" from the toolbar and then "Full Screen" from the list on the   left side of the window. Check "Active Screen Corners" and select "-"   for each screen corner.)   Parallels Forum - Answer #4  <answer161339> So it seems someone found a working solution, at last.  First,  ul liclose your VMs/li liQuit VirtualBox/li /ul  then as emroot/em (or codesudo .../code)   ul licopy the file somewhere as backup, then edit (eg codevi/code) code/Applications/VirtualBox.app/Contents/Resources/VirtualBoxVM.app/Contents/Info.plist/code/li liand add the line shown in the middle/li /ul  the line code&lt;key&gt;LSUIElement&lt;/key&gt; &lt;string&gt;1&lt;/string&gt;/code to be inserted between codeLSCanProvideIMVideoDataSource/code and codeNSHighResolutionCapable/code  precode&lt;key&gt;LSCanProvideIMVideoDataSource&lt;/key&gt;    &lt;true/&gt; &lt;key&gt;LSUIElement&lt;/key&gt; &lt;string&gt;1&lt;/string&gt; &lt;key&gt;NSHighResolutionCapable&lt;/key&gt;          &lt;true/&gt; /code/pre  save, then start VirtualBox again (I didn't have to log out/reboot).  The VM will not show anymore among the opened apps icons, but you can double click the VM in the VirtualBox to switch to it.  The whole post by emMaestro/em is here.  <comment168665> Unfortunately doesn't work in latest Mavericks / VirtualBox (this answer is for Parallels actually). <comment177610> The virtualisation software being used is Oracle VirtualBox, not Parallels Desktop.
