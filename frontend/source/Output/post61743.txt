Best way to stream videos and music from my iPhone to my TV? <body> So I got a samsung galaxy s advance and found out that it can stream stored music and videos wirelessly (via WIFI) to my TV. It is very efficient with no buffering time and full HD quality.  I use an AppleTV for my iPhone, however the connection keeps dropping (the icon disappears), the buffering time takes ages to load a video stored in my iPhone, and the whole experience is very dissatisfying.  Is there another way (through an App or Cydia app) that allows streaming similar to the Galaxy S ?? I have a jailbroken iPhone so I can use cydia.  Thanks  <answer61750> Well, this is one of those things where there's 101 ways to do it and it's just trial and error to see which works best for you. You could try wired connections using an HDMI cable  or composite AV from your iphone to your TV, or there's a variety of aftermarket apps that may work better for you. I've detailed some ideas below:  h2Connect With HDMI/h2  You'll need to purchase an adaptor for this option.  ol liPlug the adapter into your device’s 30-pin iPod connector./li liPlug one end of an HDMI cable into the HDMI port of the adapter, and the other end into an available HDMI port on your TV./li liSwitch your TV to the appropriate HDMI input. For earlier models such as the iPhone 4, the original iPad, or the fourth-generation iPod Touch, the display won’t be mirrored, but it will show photos and videos in supported apps once you start playing them on the device./li /ol  h2Connect With Composite AV/h2  If your TV doesn’t support HDMI, or if it doesn’t have an available connection, you can link your device to the set through an analog connection, using an Apple Composite AV cable.  ol liPlug the adapter into your device’s 30-pin iPod connector./li liPlug the yellow video cable at the end of the adapter into an available analog video port on your TV./li liPlug the red and white audio cables at the end of the adapter into the red and white audio ports corresponding to the yellow video input on your TV./li liTune your TV to the appropriate composite video input. The display won’t be mirrored, but it will show photos and videos in supported apps once you start playing them on the device./li /ol  h2Connect Wirelessly via Airplay/h2  Apple developed a wireless technology called AirPlay specifically for streaming content from iOS devices to other devices that support it.  ol liMake sure that your iPhone is on the same wireless network as your other AirPlay devices./li liOn your iPhone, double-tap the Home button./li liSwipe the list that appears to the right, until you get to the volume and AirPlay settings./li liTap the AirPlay button to bring up a list of supported AirPlay devices on your network./li liTap the device to which you would like to stream. A TV icon next to the device indicates that you can stream images, video, and/or audio, while a speaker icon indicates that you can stream only audio./li /ol  h2Connect Wirelessly via DLNA/h2  If you don't want to shell out for an AirPlay-capable device, you may be able to use DLNA instead. These days, many modern TVs support streaming from a local network (wired or wireless) via the DLNA (Digital Living Network Alliance) standard. If your TV supports DLNA (or sometimes just "UPnP") streaming, you can use your iPhone as a DLNA server. Just download and install a DLNA-server app--Media:connect, for example--and you're good to go.  h2Connect Wirelessly with Aftermarket Apps/h2  You could try iMediaShare or AirVideoEnabler as alternatives to the standard airplay functionality.  <answer81092> I'm wondering if anyone else is using this. Here is a list of 14 useful DLNA Streaming Apps For iPhone.  <comment71308> Thank you for your reply. I am interested in Wireless streaming so the DLNA and aftermarket apps sound useful. I tried iMediaShare, however the video pauses and waits (buffers) while it plays, which is very frustrating. Is there a popular app that is known for its efficiency ? <comment71425> It'll depend largely on your equipment, what you're trying to stream, what you're trying to stream to, what router you're using etc. I would give DLNA a try and see if that works better for you, I think Media:connect is free. <comment93516> Could you please summarise the blog not just give a link <comment124206> How exactly is the Apple TV loading a video that's stored on your iPhone? Are you running a server there or are you using airplay and the phone is streaming video to the Apple TV? <comment124218> Im connecting my iPhone via Airplay and streaming videos to the TV. Anyway this was asked back in 2012 and my problem is fixed now. It was a router issue that keeps dropping my connection. <comment124231> Awesome update - glad it was sorted for you. I missed the accepted tick when I commented this am. Thanks
