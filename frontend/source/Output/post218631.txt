Is a "2 GHz Intel Core Duo" really the same as a "2 GHz Intel Core ***2*** Duo" <body> I'm trying to get Sling TV set up on an older iMac.  It has  ul li10.6 (the minimum required OS),/li li2.5 GB RAM (~2.5 times the required memory), and/li lia 2 GHz Intel Core strongem2/em/strong Duo./li /ul  However, the Sling TV web site claims you need a "2 GHz Intel Core Duo".  I wasn't aware that there was such a thing, but Googling for the difference between them turned up nothing apparently useful, and even Googling for "2 GHz Intel Core Duo" turned up very littleâ€”most results refer to the 2 GHz Intel Core strongem2/em/strong Duo.  HOWEVER there is a page from Intel which mentions "2 GHz Intel Core Duo".  Is this a different CPU, or just another way of referring to the 2 GHz Intel Core strongem2/em/strong Duo?  If they are different CPUs, can I assume the Core 2 came later, and therefore I have a newer CPU than Sling requires?  <answer218633> Yes, the Core 2 Duo and Core Duo are different and the Core 2 Duo came later so your iMac should support any software that requires at least a Core Duo.  You can tell because the Early 2006 MacBook Pro used the Core Duo while every MacBook Pro after that until 2010 used a Core 2 Duo. This isn't definitive in proving that the Core 2 came after the Core, but Apple's not going to continually downgrade the processor in its top-of-the-line laptop year after year, plus the "2" usually denotes a successor anyway.  <answer218634> They are different processors.      The Core Duo was released earlier in 2006. The Core 2 Duo was released mid 2006.
