how to assign keyboard shortcut to buried command? <body> In Chrome, if I do kbdcmd/kbd+kbdP/kbd to print, and click Print Using System Dialog, then click on the PDF dropdown button, I get a command called Save PDF to DEVONthink Pro.   In System Preferences  Keyboard  App Shortcuts, I created a shortcut named Save PDF to DEVONthink Pro. But pressing that keystroke has no effect.   How do can I call this command using a single keystroke?  <answer120105> Here is the code :   precodetell application "Google Chrome"     activate      tell window 1 to tell active tab to print     tell application "System Events" to tell process "Google Chrome"         delay 1         tell window "Print"             click menu button "PDF"             delay 1             try                 click menu item # of menu of menu button "PDF"             end try         end tell     end tell end tell /code/pre  Just replace the code#/codewith the index of your script in the menu.

I could provide the code but I don't get where you have your drop-down button. <comment140026> Hmm. When I Print using system dialog, then click on `PDF`, I get other options. <comment140027> Ok I see.  If no one answers this and if OP is patient, OP will get answer tomorrow :)
