Where is the "Free on iTunes" link? <body> Is "Free on iTunes" gone again? I'm unable to find the "Free on iTunes" link from the iOS app. I have seen no announcements nor news that "Free on iTunes" was going to be removed. How do I locate this link (if it's still available)?  <answer195389> On an iPhone, you're right it's currently missing even on 8.3. Perhaps an oversight. On iPad, it's ok. Open up the iTunes Store, it's in the footer for Music:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sxRZs.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment233246> In which app are you looking for this link? <comment233247> The latest version of iTunes to date, iTunes iOS 8.4 <comment233425> The iPad seems like the oversight as the link has also been removed from the desktop iTunes store. Seems like Apple is quietly removing free content.
