Fit 2 video clips in iMovie side by side without cropping <body> When using iMovie's side-by-side feature, it cropped the clips automatically by default.  How do we make it to fit the clips into the final clip without cropping any parts of the images?

Click Cropping, then set the style to Crop to Fill and extend the crop to be the entire size of your input video. Repeat this step for the other video clip.  hr  ol liAdd one of the clips to the timeline and drag the other clip above the existing clip in the timeline./li liGo to Adjust → Video overlay settings, set the video overlay style to Side by Side and the side for the current clip.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GcMzY.png" width="166"/li liGo to Adjust → Cropping and set the cropping style to Crop to Fill  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Nl9WI.png" width="287"/li liDrag the bounds box to the edges of the selected clip./li liRepeat the previous two steps for the other clip./li /ol  <comment162222> I see nothing, just black screens. <comment162239> @Buscar If you mean inside the device displays, it's meant to be like that. If you mean the screenshots themselves, something's broken with your internet.
