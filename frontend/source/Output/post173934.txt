OneDrive not syncing on mac <body> I have OneDrive on my new computer and I have about 50gb to upload using the OneDrive client from the Mac App Store. It scans the files but always hangs after trying to upload a few kilobytes. Any help?  <answer173937> Unless you have paid for additional OneDrive storage, you will only get 10 GB of storage to begin with. This may be why.  Also, you may want to contact Microsoft if you have paid for additional storage.  <comment204710> I have paid for 1tb of storage so I am certain that that isn't the problem. I think it has to do with the actual client software. <comment204712> @woakley5 Is there a crash log available? Also, could you upload it through the web interface? <comment204719> Can you login and transfer files without any problems through the OneDrive web portal?
