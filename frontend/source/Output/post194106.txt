Enable Web Inspector in Safari v 8.0 in Yosemite OS <body> I'm trying to show/hide the web inspector tool in mac os "Yosemite" using bash script, I used the following command in terminal but it didn't work even after I restarted Safari, so am I doing something wrong?  precodedefaults write com.apple.Safari WebKitDeveloperExtras â€“Boolean /code/pre  <answer194110> codedefaults write NSGlobalDomain WebKitDeveloperExtras -bool true/code  adds Inspect Element to the right-click menu  However, opening the Develop menu will do it too  codedefaults write com.apple.Safari IncludeDevelopMenu -bool true/code  One additional note about toggling the Develop menu this way is that it isn't interactive with the Safari prefs pane, &amp; can result in reversed behaviour if later toggled from there by the user.  <comment231423> Do you actually just write "boolean" or put a 1/0 there? (defaults write com.apple.Safari WebKitDeveloperExtras 0 or defaults write com.apple.Safari WebKitDeveloperExtras 1) <comment231424> I tried commands you added but unfortunately didn't work too <comment231425> Wouldn't it just be easier to hit Cmd/opt/i ? <comment231426> No because I need to write this command in a mac application. <comment231428> how about under NSGlobalDomain ?
