How to transfer contacts from iPhone to PC? <body> I have contacts on my iPhone 5 that I wish to transfer to my PC. I know how to transfer photos from iPhone to PC, but I don't know how to do the same for contacts. How can I transfer contacts?  <answer140415> You can use one of the free apps (e.g. My Contacts Backup) on the AppStore to export all of your contacts and Mail it to your e-Mail account or save it to Dropbox etc.   Another way is, if you have your Contacts on iCloud. SignIn on icloud.com navigate to Contacts - Press codecmd/code+codeA/code or codectrl/code+codeA/code on Windows. The in the corner left ist a Gear Symbol - and select Export vCard   <comment165503> Welcome to Ask Different!
