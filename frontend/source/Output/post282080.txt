disabling spell check systemwide still possible in sierra? <body> actually I wanted to comment my question directly in the thread emIs it possible to disable spell check systemwide?/em , but as I have not enough reputation to comment, I open a new thread:  I just upgraded from el capitan to sierra and wanted to disable spell check as always for years now with this procedure:  precodesudo mv /System/Library/Services/AppleSpell.service/Contents/Resources \         /System/Library/Services/AppleSpell.service/Contents/Resources.disabled killall AppleSpell /code/pre  source of the procedure is the thread linked above.  unfortunately this procedure doesn't work anymore as the emResources/em file does not exist anymore in emSystem/Library/Services/AppleSpell.service/Contents/em   does anybody know how to get rid of the spell check in sierra?  would be appreciated emvery much/em  thx :)
