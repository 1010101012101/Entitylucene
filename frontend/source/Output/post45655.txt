How to remap delete and shift+delete keys to delete and permanently delete a file in Mac OS X Lion? <body> I would like to delete and permanently delete a file in finder using del and shift+delete (windows style).  Is there any way to remap this in OS X lion?  <answer45658> If you want to delete files immediately, you can copy the files, open Terminal or iTerm, type coderm -r ‌/code and press ⌘V.  If you want to delete the files securely so that they cannot be recovered with an application like DiskWarrior or DataRescue, you can use codesrm -srf/code. codesrm/code uses the 35-pass Gutmann algorithm by default, but code-s/code only overwrites files with a single pass of random data.  You could also create a service like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/shMlV.png" alt=""  precodeosascript -e 'on run argv     set text item delimiters to linefeed     tell application "Finder"         display dialog "Delete the following files immediately?" &amp; linefeed &amp; linefeed &amp; text items of argv     end tell end run' "$@" [[ $? != 0 ]] &amp;&amp; exit 0 rm -rf "$@" /code/pre  I didn't use an Ask for Confirmation action, because it can't be used to display the paths specified as arguments, and the dialogs shown by it don't get keyboard focus.  The service cannot be used to delete a file if deleting it would require superuser privileges.  You can give the service a keyboard shortcut from System Preferences  Keyboard  Keyboard Shortcuts  Services. The shortcut recorders don't allow entering ⇧⌦ as a keyboard shortcut, but you can first give the service some temporary shortcut, then close the System Preferences window, then run something like codef=~/Library/Preferences/pbs.plist; plutil -convert xml1 $f; open -e $f/code, and then change the key equivalent to code$&amp;#x007F;/code:  precode&lt;key&gt;(null) - Delete Immediately - runWorkflowAsService&lt;/key&gt; &lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;key_equivalent&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;$&amp;#xU007F;&lt;/string&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; /code/pre  code$&amp;#x007F;/code is ⇧⌦ (where ⌦ is Mac forward delete / Windows delete). ⇧⌫ would be code$&amp;#x0008;/code (where ⌫ is Mac delete / Windows backspace). The format used for the shortcut strings is described in http://lri.me/keybindings.html.  hr  As for making ⌦ (Mac forward delete / Windows delete) move files to the trash, you can modify Finder's property list:  precodedefaults write com.apple.finder NSUserKeyEquivalents -dict 'Move to Trash' '\U007F' killall Finder /code/pre  However that also makes pressing ⌦ move a file to the trash when you are renaming a file.  <answer45667> If a two-step keyboard process is acceptable, you could always do:  KBD⌘/KBD + KBD⌫/KBD to move the file to the Trash  then  KBD⌘/KBD + KBD⇧/KBD + KBD⌫/KBD to empty the Trash (with confirmation popup) or  KBD⌘/KBD + KBD⇧/KBD + KBD⌥/KBD +KBD⌫/KBD to empty the Trash (without confirmation popup).   Obviously, that will also get rid of all the other files already in the trash.  Alternatively, maybe something like Trash X would help. The description says:     You can use it to instantly delete or shred file and folders without   sending them to the trash. You can use it to empty or shred trash only   on selected disks. And of course, you can use it just like the   trashcan you've always had on your desktop.   <answer77690> I have made a simple app in cocoa, which acts like the trash icon but with different behaviour ie. when a file or folder is dropped on its icon in dock, it deletes it permanently.  I have also written a blog post about it- Mac OS X : shift + delete  Here is the link for the app- DeleteMe  Basic idea is - use: strongrm -rf/strong  , exactly the same what is suggested in the most voted answer, but implemented in a different way ;-)  strongUpdate/strong  Now there is a better way to achieve 'permanent delete' functionality as specified by Matt Sephton in comment to this answer - strongJust use command + alt (option) + backspace/strong. Thanks to him for the update.  <answer98830> What you can do is send the file(s) to trash, and then click Finder-Secure Empty Trash.  You can also make a keyboard shortcut to make that process a little quicker, as described in this article.  It's not exactly what you want, but seems to be the closest you can get without looking into creating something with Automator or Keyboard Maestro.  <comment52013> Why? What is wrong with command-delete? <comment52021> If only your answer would only consist of that last sentence ;-) <comment52401> after reading the last line ... this approach is almost useless unless we have a workaround for using delete in renaming the file <comment116123> See [this](http://superuser.com/questions/10676/permanently-deleting-files-on-mac-os) question SU. You can also always use the terminal and `rm`. <comment116126> @Linuxios Very good find :) <comment116127> Sure. SU usually has better answers for these power user questions than the "consumer" oriented sites (Ask Different, Ask Ubuntu, etc.). <comment116128> @Linuxios I thought that SU was supposed to be alot less Apple flavoured than AskDifferent ? <comment116129> SU is for anything more power user than end user. Ask Different hovers between consumer and power user. <comment116130> Nice article. What is Keyboard Maestro ? (perhaps a hyperlink to it in your answer if possible) <comment116131> @Linuxios Good to know. <comment116132> Excellent, much appreciated :) <comment116133> I've added a [link](http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/).  It's an application that allows you to create various type of macros, or keyboard shortcuts, to do things quicker. You can create shortcuts to do some very complicated multi-step things. Probably overkill to buy for just this one task, though. <comment371421> `⌘` + `⌫` How have I only just discovered this? <comment373482> It's easier to just press Cmd+Alt+Delete/Backspace http://i.imgur.com/9pHcsHT.png <comment373483> `⌘`+`⌥`+`⌫` to delete the file immediately
