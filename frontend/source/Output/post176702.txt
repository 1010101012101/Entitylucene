How do I get the name of the wifi network I'm connected to? <body> I know how to find it out in Objective C, but I need to do this in a shell script.  (I could compile and install one of the example programs given in the link, but surely there is already a command line program installed that will give me this information?)  I have MacOS X Yosemite, 10.10.2.  <answer176703> precode/Sy*/L*/Priv*/Apple8*/V*/C*/R*/airport -I | grep SSID /code/pre  This uses the airport CLI, with the code-I/code flag to show information and grep for SSID shows the name of the network.
