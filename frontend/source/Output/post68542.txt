Sync pictures of iPhone with Mac <body> How can I sync the pictures from my iPhone (5, iOS 6) to the Mac (OS X 10.8.2) (but not vice versa) via WiFi but without going through the cloud? In case it matters, I am using iPhoto on the Mac.  <answer68548> Connect the phone to the Mac. Launch iPhoto. Click import.  <comment79642> They did specify Wifi sync, which implies no cord. <comment79663> Dead right they did, I misread. Apologies <comment80157> I don't know of a Wi-Fi solution, but tethered via USB there are many apps to manage this. On the Mac, I'd start with [PadSync](http://www.ecamm.com/mac/padsync/) <comment80158> The tethered solution for me is iPhoto, which works pretty well. <comment80159> Hmm - so you just import them in iPhoto rather than using PhotoStream or the Image Capture app? <comment80160> Yes, because PhotoStream goes through the cloud.
