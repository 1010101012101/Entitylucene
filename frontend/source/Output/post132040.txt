Where does Screensaver store images? <body> I have only used iPhoto a couple of times by accident (preferring one of the many alternatives).  Each time, I carefully removed those images from iPhoto to the iPhoto trashcan and then emptied the iPhoto trash. Consequently, all the iPhoto sections appear empty:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uZnzZ.png" alt="enter image description here"  But when I look at the screensaver, pictures show up when one of the iPhoto directories is selected (the directories can't be deleted in any way I know).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hZpYl.png" alt="enter image description here"  I'm assuming that the images were copied into a screensaver cache (or maybe a link was created). strongWhere are these screen saver images stored?/strong  BTW, I'm still running Snow Leopard on a beautiful 4gig iMac. Thanks!  <answer132059> After scrounging around in plist files (thank you codefind/code and codegrep/code!), I found the beginnings of an answer, but I'm still a little confused.  It seems that those pesky images have been lingering around (renamed, of course) in the following directory: code~/Pictures//code  Deleted them, and now when selecting any of the iPhoto portions of Screensaver, I get the appropriate error message: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/krcBn.png" alt="The selected source contains no pictures. Please choose a new source..."  -Yeah, that's the ticket!  I hope others will have more details, so I'll wait a couple of days before accepting an answer.
