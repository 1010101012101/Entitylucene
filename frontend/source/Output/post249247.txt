WD My Passport for Mac - Unstable Sectors <body> Today I thought that my WD external hard drive was making some noises. I don't know if it was coming from it, or somewhere else, but I decided to look into it a bit. According to DriveDx, the hard drive had one unstable sector that needed remapping. I have a few things on my HDD that I would like to keep, and have backed them up already. Currently, I am installing Windows 7 on a VM so I can test it out with WD's own utilities, as Windows 10 1607 bootcamp HFS+ drivers don't work at the moment.  Should I immediately be concerned about getting a new hard drive should this drive fail, or is 1 unstable sector a very minor issue?
