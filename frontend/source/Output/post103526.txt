Lock out iTunes Store <body> Can I lock out the iTunes store so no purchases can be made on my iPad? I don't see that possibility in Settings. I accidentally purchased music I did not want and tried to cancel it immediately but couldn't. I want to be able to buy apps but no music.  <answer103532> Go to System Preferences  General  Restrictions. Turn iTunes Store off. As long as you leave the Installing Apps setting on, you should still be able to access the App Store.  <comment121825> Settings  General  Restrictions. It's all there.
