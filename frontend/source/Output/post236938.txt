OS X El Capitan: Connected to Wi-Fi / Personal Hotspot network but not connected to Internet <body> I recently updated to El Capitan.   But now when connection is established with my college's Wi-Fi network I am unable to use internet. Same goes for Personal Hotspots.  Everything was working fine in Yosemite.  strongHow can I fix this?/strong  <answer236980> Try setting a new network location. Network Preferences/edit top drop down/new location/apply If that doesn't work you may need to reinstall OS to resolve software issue.  <answer237005> See if you set a wrong DNS address in system preferences - network  <comment290133> Setting a new location worked.
