Disable automatic iTunes launch when iPhone is plugged in via USB <body> How do I disable automatic iTunes launch when iPhone is plugged in via USB (for charging)?    In fact, I would like to disable automatic launch of anything when an iPhone is plugged in (including photo sync).  <answer123986> ul lih3iTunes/h3  Open iTunes, select your device, go to the Summary tab and unselect either strongOpen iTunes when this iPhone is connected/strong, or strongAutomatically sync when this iPhone is connected/strong depending on your version of iTunes.  Also, you might wish to disable iTunes Helper. Go to System Preferences → Users &amp; Groups → Login Items and delete iTunes Helper from the list./li lih3iPhoto/h3  Open iPhoto, open Preferences (iPhoto → Preferences or ⌘,). Select General tab and set strongConnecting camera opens/strong to strongNo application/strong./li lih3Photos (new version of iPhoto)/h3  Let Photos open when you connect your device, select the "Import" tab and untick the box for "Open Photos for this device"/li /ul  <comment159781> Note that some people have reported the "Open iTunes when this iPhone is connected" option does not appear in the list. Not sure exactly what the conditions are, but the only relevant option is whether automatic sync is enabled (disabling it prevents iTunes from opening, but also prevents auto-sync when you manually open iTunes). That said, disabling the iTunes helper in login items does fix the problem. <comment194963> @drfrogsplat I too encountered this on the Windows version of iTunes, so I guess that those people who reported it were also using Windows. <comment242517> +1 for the Login Items solution <comment250889> I don't have an updated iTunes because I don't use it, so the updated iPhone triggers the launch, but I cannot access iPhone Summary tab. I just kill -9 the process related to iTunes Helper (because even with login options item disabled it seems to run). <comment255718> Since iPhotos became Photos the option is now located in a different place.  In order to stop Photos from opening on connection, let Photos open when you connect your device, select the `Import` tab and untick the box for `Open Photos for this device` <comment331624> FYI: You can find your login items by opening Settings  Users & Groups, Click on a user, unlock the padlock  Login Items tab <comment331646> @AdamGrant I already mention how to access your login items in my answer. Your instructions are also incorrect; 'System Preferences' is the app name, since login items are only accessible when currently signed in as that user there is no 'click on a user' step, finally login items are user-specific so the padlock has no effect therefore there is no 'unlock the padlock' step, thus leaving you with the steps I provided in my answer. <comment331682> **pours a cup of tea and offers it to @grgarside** <comment331734> @AdamGrant Aha cheers, my apologies for being curt, I shouldn't be on SE at 1am
