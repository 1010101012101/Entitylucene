Passing selected folder path to custom Service executing AppleScript <body> I have a custom Service I created in Automater. Right now, the service shows up in my context (right-click) menu, when right-clicking on any folder. In Automater, I added the Run AppleScript action, to execute this code:  precodeon run {input, parameters}     do shell script "/usr/bin/find ./ -type f -name .DS_Store -delete -print"     return input end run /code/pre  My objective is to delete all code.DS_Store/code files in the selected folder (and all folders within it). I normally do this in Terminal by executing code/usr/bin/find /path-to-folder -type f -name .DS_Store -delete -print/code, but I would love to get this to work from my custom Service.  I'm thinking I need to pass the selected folders path to the AppleScript function (through codeinput/code perhaps?), but I have no idea how, nor do I see any actions in Automater to pass this. I'm using OSX 10.6.5. Any ideas or suggestions?  <answer4936> At the top of the screen, above your action, there should be a list-box that says codeService receives selected &lt;text&gt; in &lt;any application&gt;/code.  Changing code&lt;text&gt;/code to codefolders/code should give you the folders as codeinput/code.  <comment4958> Thank you. That's it. You wouldn't happen to also know how to convert the path it passes `Macintosh HD:Users:Matthew:Documents:Programming:Apple Scripts:` to a path like `Macintosh\ HD/Users/Matthew/Documents/Programming/Apple\ Scripts`? <comment4960> @matthewpavkov: unfortunately no... but there might be a command line utility.  feel free to create another question, I'm sure someone around here knows :P
