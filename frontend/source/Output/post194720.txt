How can I disable the "no backup in x days" from TimeMachine? <body> I'm running OS X Yosemite, and I want to disable the notifications from Time Machine. I rarely do a hard-drive backup because all of my essential files are in the cloud. I don't need to run timemachine as often as it suggests/warns/annoys me about.  How do I disable the notifications? Time Machine is not in the Notifications preferences, and I don't want to stop using it entirely.   <answer194727> When you don't have the external hard drive hooked up, go strongSystem Preferences/strong  strongTime Machine/strong, and switch it to strongOFF/strong. You will still be able to perform backups, it just won't happen automatically.  This is the technique that I use, and I don't see notifications.  <comment232441> Thanks! So simple... I guess I didn't realize that I could turn it off. I thought it was doing some sort of local cataloging as well. <comment288046> Remember one backup is not sufficient Time Machine and in the cloud is probably the minimum <comment310517> Actually, it looks like it is storing history locally. I can go back to yesterday, last week and many other points in the past that were not back-up remotely. <comment323540> nice, fixed!!!!!!!!
