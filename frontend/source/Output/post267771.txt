iTunes doesn't open and give a blank message <body> I've been having troubles with iTunes :  it was working yesterday morning, and after I restarted my computer it will no longer run, it just gives me an empty message box   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vWA96.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  and if I leave it for a moment an error appears:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/d8kOH.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  The problem occurred when I was on a old version of OSX, so I updated to Sierra and to the newest version of iTunes as well, didn't change a thing. What I have tried :  ol lirestart computer/li liInstall Sierra with iTunes 12.5.4/li liTry to remove iTunes, I just have a message : iTunes can't be modified or deleted since Mac OS requires it /li liTry and download iTunes from the Apple website : the available one was 12.4.3, so when I try to install it tells me a newer version is already installed and stops./li /ol  Any ideas ?  Thanks in advance.  <answer267772> Exploratory troubleshooting: try holding the Option (or Alt) key down while you launch iTunes. Hold it until you see the following:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/igHgE.png" alt="Choose iTunes Library"  Now press "Create Libraryâ€¦" and see if you have any more success.  As a second option, try creating a new user on your system and see if iTunes works any different/better there.  These are steps to help you determine if the problem is the iTunes emapplication/em or if it's something specific to your user account and its data.  <comment336047> Pro Tip:- Rather than Cmd/shift/3 for a full screenshot, if you use Cmd/shift/4 then tap the Spacebar & click in the window you want, you'll get a picture of only that window, with a nice drop-shadow too. I trimmed the existing shots for you. <comment336093> @Tetsujin Oh my gosh best tip ever. <comment336095> There's a QA on it, all the alternatives - http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3822/how-do-i-take-a-screenshot-on-my-mac <comment336120> Thanks for answering me.
