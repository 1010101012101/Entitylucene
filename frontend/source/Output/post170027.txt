Slow Internet Problem On Yosemite <body> Internet connection is really so slow on MacBook Air 13' Yosemite . Called tech support of ISP and they said my connection is OK . My internet plan has 16 MBPS speed but when I do a speed test on my MacBook, it's just 2-3 MBPS . But in my mobile phone, internet connection is really good. So I thing I have a problem with Mac OS configuration.  These are my System Preferences  Network settings :   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IyL5w.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DuH51.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0MF51.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xvcsO.png" alt="enter image description here"  BTW , connection is not slow always, sometimes it's getting better. For example it's took about 10 minutes to upload these 4 images, but now my connection is better.  Can you tell what should i do for better connection ?  Note : I can't try it without Wi-Fi , with an ethernet cable, because I don't have a ethernet slot on my Mac.  strongUPDATE 1/strong  When internet connection is good :  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6zbcx.png" alt="enter image description here"  When it's bad :  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DhQOV.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment199856> if you have Ethernet cable connection get a Thunderbolt to Ethernet adapter. <comment199858> The information provide is not sufficient to tell. Use (hold) the alt (option) key and click on your wifi icon then report the results here. <comment199953> @Buscar웃 , thank you. I'll send all reports here, but (what a luck!) my connection is really good right now. I will send report when it's getting slower again. <comment200282> Which file should I send you ?  Whole .tar.gz file ? @Buscar웃 <comment200283> Just a screen shot of what is it showing when you hold the "alt" (option) key and click on the wifi icon. <comment201764> @Buscar웃 please check **UPDATE 1** on question. Thank you. <comment201789> Hi, thanks for the update, I think you got the pictures reversed (the good and the bad :), In one case it should be just a bit slower due to signal strength (-66dBm), but other than that it should be ok. <comment201999> Yes it's weird but connection was better when RSSI is -66 :) <comment202003> well according to your WiFi, your Transmit rate and the MCS index are 20/2 and 26/3. In both cases not bad, while the MCS of 2 is on the low side, still it should not show as very slow, but slower. So watch those numbers some more to see what is happening. Just out of interest, you have endless number of Network profiles using dial up or phone (like Samsung) ? why ? <comment205636> @Buscar웃 I don't have any idea, where these profiles come from. :) I'll delete them, but I need to research first, and I'm to lazy for this job.
