iTunes 12.5+ plist setting for View As -> Songs by default? <body> I find the the default view of songs to "Songs" too white and it's irritating / abominable to view codePlaylist/code that way. It does't show enough details for my taste so I'd rather see something else than the current default view (Playlist): img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JCxrm.jpg" alt="playlist view"  Instead, I would like to see content directly as the Songs view instead: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZHQnA.jpg" alt="songs view"  Does anyone know of a plist setting (in codecom.apple.iTunes.plist/code) to change the default view of songs to "Songs" instead of the codePlaylist/code setting?    <comment327949> Could you provide pictures showing what you mean? As far as I'm aware, whatever defaults were, they are overwritten by 'whatever you last did' as soon as you do it. <comment327953> Added images as per request. <comment327956> & you want a prefs tweak to make all **new** playlists to have the 2nd example view? If so, understood - though idk how, I just swap mine afterwards :/ Cmd/J btw for view options, same as Finder, but idk how to override defaults. <comment327958> Hmm, yes. Not just new, but old as well. This new blinding white color vs the custom colors defined by album art before is very difficult. <comment327959> Actually, I hated the 'blurry album art' version. I like my lists to be lists, not 'arty' ;-) I'd actually forgotten it used to do that, so glad it's gone. [But, horses for courses & I hope someone knows the answer to your question. Good luck.] <comment327967> Well, for me it's not about the artsy aspect of it, but a DARK aspect.  I have iTunes up all of the time on one of my displays (I have multiple heads on my main system) and it's like having a sun blaring all day and night. :)
