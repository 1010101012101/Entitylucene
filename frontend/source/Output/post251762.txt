Mail.app attached images are displayed as tiny thumbnails in other clients <body> In Yosemite (10.10.5) Mail.app, when I send emails with attached images, they are displayed incorrectly in some email clients, including Gmail web browser.  I've tried drag-n-drop the JPEG from Finder to Mail, and also File  Attach.  Both methods produce the same result, with or without the "Windows-Friendly Attachment" option.  This happens with Gmail IMAP and iCloud accounts.  As a test, I send myself a message with a JPEG attachment.  Here is the email source code from the recipient.  The message displays correctly in Apple Mail and in iOS mail, but in Outlook and Gmail web browser, it shows an in-line image reduced to 172px wide.
