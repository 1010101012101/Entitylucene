Can't resize main partition even in G-Parted <body> So I had an old partition that I deleted, and now moved all my stuff to the new one. Now I am out of space, and I want to resize it to fill the whole hard drive.  But Disk Utility wouldn't let me resize the partition! It is grayed out.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BhV3s.png" alt="enter image description here"  So...  I boot off of G-Parted Partition Editor, and sure enough, I couldn't resize the partition! I could only make it a bit smaller to the few megabytes of remaining space.  What is wrong, and is there a way to fix this?   <answer117876> It's greyed out because the free space is embefore/em the partition.  Try resizing using strongiPartition/strong. iPartition can move partitions without data loss, which can usually get you out of sticky situations such as this.  You can modify the boot disk by making a bootable CD/DVD or installing on an external OS X installation.  <answer118493> As already mentioned, the free space is embefore/em the start of your partition. You can't grow a partition from the emstart/em - you can only expand it from its end.  You can try something like this:  ol liCreate a partition in the free space/li liUse something like Carbon Copy Cloner to copy the contents of your current partition into the new one/li liBoot from the new partition/li liMake sure everything works fine from the new partition - try all your usual programs, and make sure it's exactly the same as it always was/li liDelete the old partition/li liExpand the new partition to fill the hard disk space completely (reusing the space that was used by the old partition)/li /ol  There are a few other options as well as Carbon Copy Cloner, but it has worked well for me in the past, and will make the target partition bootable.  <comment138519> Well I ended up messing around and something made no partition bootable, but I was able to retrieve the files and I also had a backup so I can just start fresh and new. Thanks for the help though
