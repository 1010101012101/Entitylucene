Why can't I vote on iTunes Radio songs? <body> The like and dislike options are grayed out. I'm on an iPhone 5s and iOS 7.0.  Any ideas?  <answer102693> According the Apple support doc for iTunes Radio:     There may be some DJ-curated stations that you may not be able to   modify. You can't like or play more tracks like this while listening   to some DJ-curated stations. You can however, start new stations based   on the current track or artist of a featured station or add tracks to   your iTunes Wishlist from the Star (✭) menu.   <comment120847> Is it possible for you give us but more information to prevent wild guessing. For example, what have you tried, are you logged in iTunes, what OS? what device ? You have 2k points, you should know how to ask a question. <comment120848> @Buscar웃 updated question. Also it looks like this is related. http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/102435/why-isnt-itunes-radio-presenting-the-options-affecting-station-variety <comment120857> You might have to reinstall the remote and reestablish the connections to you DJ stations, assuming thy did not block you. <comment120858> @Buscar웃 What do you mean by 'reinstall the remote'? <comment120863> http://support.apple.com/kb/PH1741
