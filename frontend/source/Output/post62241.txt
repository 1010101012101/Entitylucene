Select text in a Quick Look window? <body> Is there any possibility (default write, or something else) to copy text directly from a quick look window? It annoys me that I cannot select and copy text snippets directly from Quick Look.  <answer62242> In Terminal, enter:  precodedefaults write com.apple.finder QLEnableTextSelection -bool TRUE /code/pre  You have to restart Finder before the option will be available.  Found this on: http://www.defaults-write.com  <comment165913> Please notice that the activation of the "Text-Selection-In-Quicklook"-Feature could lead to the bug described in this question:  [QuickLook having problems displaying some images](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/128825/quicklook-having-problems-displaying-some-images)
