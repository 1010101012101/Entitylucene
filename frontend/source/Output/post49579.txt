Theme related issue <body> The attached image(s) should be a visual reference to what I am attempting to verbalize. My issue is that last summer I was playing with theme management on OS X 10.6.x and all was well but lately programs like luxrender &amp; virtualbox show up with clear/transparent backdrops and viewing the dialog boxes is difficult sometimes impossible. I'm wondering if anyone is aware of the file(s) I might need to replace/alter to correct this issue as a reinstall seems a bit heavy handed to rectify this situation... (When viewing the image(s) please note that when I view the actual program my desktop or whatever is behind the window bleeds through) Any and all help with this matter would be welcomed &amp; appreciated!  (ANNOTATION: images aren't allowed by new users so please ignore references)  <answer49609> If the theming's the cause of your problem you'll probably need to replace :  precode/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/CoreUI.framework/Resources/SArtFile.bin /code/pre  That's the file associated with visual styles on OS X. Hope you had a backup !  <comment56771> Can you please post a link to the images?
