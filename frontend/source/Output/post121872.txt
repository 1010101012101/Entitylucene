How to restore correct menu images? <body> I hate to post a screenshot, but I don't know how to describe this:  http://cl.ly/image/3l411o321G2f/mail.png  Yep. That's Mail.app, and all of my other apps have similar behavior. It started after I installed this package.  I've tried the instructions provided at that link to uninstall it, but it didn't help. Any tips on how to restore it manually without restoring the entire system? I'm on Mavericks.  <comment142144> You might hate to post a screenshot, but this helps a lot to make the question clear.
