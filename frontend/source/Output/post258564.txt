I-pod shuffle 4th Generation <body> MY I-pod shuffle 4th Generation*(2010) doesn't play 7 songs I downloaded. I can listen to them on my PC but the shuffle itself won't play the songs. I seem to be having an issue this time round until now this wasn't an issue.   <comment323280> Have you been downloading from Apple Music or any DRM protected services? The iPod shuffle will not play these files.
