VLC update download gives an error "while extracting the archive" <body> On a Mac Sierra, the VLC embedded update feature seems to work fine at first  precodeDownloading update ... 42.1MB /code/pre  and the download completes. However, just after, VLC gives an error  precodeUpdate Error! An error occurred while extracting the archive. Please try again later. /code/pre  Is there any way to use a workaround (that VLC bug)?  Or does somebody know where VLC does download its update file? (not in code~Downloads/code) there is maybe an access rights problem.  (without having to reinstall VLC)  <answer287215> You can download it here, for free: http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html  <comment362582> This happens from time to time, best to just download the latest full version and upgrade that way. <comment362585> Thanks but I'd like to find out what happens exactly. Knowing where the file is downloaded would help...
