What Apps allow a user to join photos of arbitrary quantity and size? <body> I was surprised this does not exist and am considering writing the App myself in response. How can you merge multiple photos into a new merged photo?   Like:  strongInput/strong  ul li200x300 "A.jpeg"/li li200x500 "B.jpeg"/li li200x100 "C.jpeg"/li /ul  strongMerged Output/strong  ul li200x900 "A+B+C.jpeg"/li /ul  Thoughts? Do I need to go write this myself :)?  <answer240678> Option "Stitch" in Photo Grid app allows you to merge multiple photos (up to 9).  <comment295695> For example, PhotoGrid, option "Stitch". <comment295894> this works, thank you!! Please put this as an 'answer' below and I will mark as solution. Thank you! :)
