App Store asks me Apple ID password with an incorrect email <body> I have an iPhone 4S from about 2 years. Till now the App Store never asked me a password different from the one I've set when create the Apple account. Today, for no apparent reason, it asked me a different email while I was trying to update my apps. I don't know this email and I think that I've never typed it, neither set it as my default email. If I go to iTunes it shows clearly that my Apple ID has the correct email, I also tried to verify it and the password is correct. But the App Store keeps asking the password for that different account, and there I can't change it. How do I "say to the App Store" that I want to sign it with a different email?    strongEdit/strong    I recognized that I haven't problems updating other apps, just one: whatsapp. I imported this app from another computer, may this be the problem?  <answer98526> First make sure that strongALL/strong the apps are downloaded/purchased from your account. If not, only emyour/em apps will update.  If you want to change account go to settings-iTunes &amp; App Store-Apple ID-Sign out-and enter your other account.  <comment113694> Is it jailbroken? Do you have any apps installed from different sources than App Store? <comment113695> @iskra Now I recognized that I have problems updating just one, which I imported from another computer. Maybe I cannot update it because it has been purchased with another account? <comment113716> Maybe that copy of Whatsapp is registered to that other guy's AppleID.  ... just a conjecture.  Maybe this is how they get each guy to download his own copy of the program...
