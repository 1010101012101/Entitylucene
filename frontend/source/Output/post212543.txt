Can I (or should I) use a MacBook charger on my iPhone? <body> I recently got a MacBook with the USB-C charger. It comes with a 29-watt power brick, and I was wondering if I should use this to charge my iPhone. I've heard that the iPad power brick (I think 10 watts) charges the phone faster. I don't expect to be able to charge the phone proportionally faster, but would the MacBook brick damage the phone? I would rather only have to carry around one charging brick around campus. Also, I have a USB to USB-C converter.  <answer212551> Unless there is some reason to the contrary that I'm not aware of, yes, you can use your MacBook charger with your iPhone. The power adapter will only convert as much power as is drawn, and the iPhone will only draw as much power as it needs.  (Note that it is not a good idea to charge your MacBook with an iPhone or iPad charger!)  <answer216715> This video shows that you can use MacBook 12" 29W USB-C Power Adapter with iPad and iPhone. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWzbaH24Q0Y  <answer234275> Yes, at least for the iPhone 6S using the Apple USB-C to Lighning 2m cable. I just started using it this week with mine and haven't had any issues.   For a few years I've charged my iPhone with an iPad charger. Not sure if the 29W charger is faster, but at least it seems just as fast.  Also, I heard in a podcast about videos warning about USB-C to USB converters. As long as you trust the one you have and it's not sketchy, I think it should be OK.  <answer265707> My Macbook Pro 13inch Late 2016 61W USB-C Power brick says output: 20.3V/3A, 9V/3A or 5.2V/2.4A. So yes you can charge your iphone with the Macbook charger. The people at the Apple store just don't know what they are selling.  <comment256629> for the same reasons addressed here: http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/2017/12285 <comment261962> -1 Link only answers are discouraged. <comment262695> I am sorry Max Ried. I just edited my answer. <comment280693> Hi. Could you possibly add pictures of the connectors (the port on the MacBook, both ends of the cord, the port on the "power brick") for those who are curious but have never seen the new MacBook model nor a USB-C cable yet? Thanks. PS: This is really amazing if Apple is going to embrace a common (though not widespread so far) standard finally... <comment286583> Yeah, I bought the proprietary one from Apple because I was worried about it. Thanks! <comment343883> Can you elaborate (or link to a source) why it's not a good idea to charge a MacBook with an iPhone charger? <comment343912> @phihag See my comment above. <comment343932> I apologize, but I am confused. Your comment links to a question like this one, which asks whether it's ok to charge an iPhone with a high-powered adapter. My question is about charging a MacBook with a lower-powered adapter. This answer says that it is **not** a good idea, without elaborating why. To get a clear answer, I have asked [my own question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/273560/3367). I'd appreciate it if you could write an answer there. Thanks! <comment343940> @phihag Simply, an iPad requires twice as much power as an iPhone charger provides, and a MacBook Pro requires an *order of magnitude* more power than an iPhone charger provides.
