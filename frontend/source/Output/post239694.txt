Dropbox folder not syncing after move <body> I moved my dropbox folder to a different location, following the instructions provided by dropbox. (I use the desktop client. codeOS X 10.11.5/code)  Specifically, I clicked on the Dropbox icon, went to Preferences - Account, and changed Dropbox location. It took a while to copy the files. Now, for some weird reason, most of my files are stuck in 'syncing'. I don't understand why it has to sync anything at all, since the files were copied within the hard drive, and no file was modified in the cloud.  It's been stuck at code6,990 files/code remaining for the last two hours. When I move the mouse over the dropbox logo, it says codeIndexing 6,990 files/code and codeCan't sync "x (Access Denied)/code. What does this even mean? There are shared folders in my dropbox that I need to use right now. What do I do?  <answer239700> It turns out the issue is with the fact that I moved my dropbox folder to an external drive. In that case, OSX creates a bunch of files named code._filename/code, which dropbox cannot sync. To clean these files, someone wrote this small script that works in the background. I installed and ran it, and my problems were solved.  <comment294266> I'd guess you just have to wait it out. It's the kind of task you should leave for overnight.
