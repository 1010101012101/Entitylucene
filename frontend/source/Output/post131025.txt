OS X 10.9.3 Update causing coreservicesd lag <body> I'm getting a lot of stalling and high CPU usage when I open folders in Finder for the first time after the 10.9.3 update. Opening that folder again works fine, but expanding a folder of 20-30 files or folders stalls the CPU on these processes for 30 seconds:     coreservicesdbr    com.apple.IconServicesAgent   I've tried relaunching Finder but the issue still occurs.  <answer132012> This is what fixed the problem for me:  ul liRebuild the Quicklook cache (in Terminal: codeqlmanage -r &amp;&amp; qlmanage -r cache/code)/li liRebuild Spotlight index (codesudo mdutil -E //code)/li /ul  I'm not exactly sure which one of those two really caused the problem. You can try them separately.br It takes a while to rebuild both the cache/index, but afterwards Finder worked as expected.  <comment153823> can you provide Console report at the time stamp <comment154043> @Buscarì›ƒ looking at it now, it seems the console isn't logging anything during these moments. I suspect this might in fact be caused by CleanMyMac 2 clearing local file caches in each directory something, but you'd think spotlight would resolve those. <comment154176> The same issue here. Did a full recovery using Diskutil (which found quite some issues), but still happening. <comment155277> Thanks for those. They executed fine but I still got the issue. <comment155278> Sorry, false alarm my spotlight is building slowly :) <comment157244> Neither rebuilding the Quicklook cache nor rebuilding the Spotlight index solved the problem for me - folders still take a long time to open, and coreservicesd and com.apple.IconServicesAgent still take up all the CPU. <comment157480> I am having the same problem and I am NOT using CleanmyMac. Also seeing same symptons running a script over multiple images in PshopCC. and BridgeCC <comment157481> @SteveS there's an accepted answer on this question -- did you try what it suggests? <comment157685> @AlfEaton I had to wait for a few hours. After a few minutes the spotlight progress showed.
