How can I display the current DNS servers from the command line under OS X? <body> I want to display the DNS servers that are used by the current network setup on OS X, from the command line.  <answer98024> There are several ways - here are two:  precodecat /etc/resolv.conf /code/pre  -or-  precodescutil --dns /code/pre  <comment313690> Its extremely annoying that `networksetup -getdnsservers` doesn't work for DHCP-assigned DNS servers. I always forget about `scutil`. The 'sc' stands for System Configuration? It sure doesn't configure much of the system... <comment372013> It's also good to note that `dig` or `nslookup` don't necessarily give a realistic picture of how the macOS applications resolve domain names from the local system, especially when multiple (domain-specific) DNSes have been configured, such as when using a VPN client for multiple concurrent connections. Instead of `nslookup` or `dig`, use `dscacheutil -q host -a name somehostname.com` to test DNS resolution. It takes into account all configured DNS servers as well as their priority order.
