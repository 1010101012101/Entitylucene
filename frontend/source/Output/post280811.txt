Safari falls asleep even when downloading <body> I've just upgraded to Sierra but Safari falls asleep even when it's downloading a file. Running codepmset -g assertions | grep Prevent/code gives  precodePreventUserIdleDisplaySleep    0 PreventSystemSleep             0 PreventUserIdleSystemSleep     0 /code/pre  On El Capitan, I got codePreventUserIdleSystemSleep 1/code.  Does anyone know why this is the case?
