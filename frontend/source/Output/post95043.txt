How to clone an audio CD (including pauses between tracks) under Mac OS X Mountain Lion? <body> I need to clone an audio CD, including the defined pauses between tracks. Under Linux, codecdrdao/code would do the trick for me, but I cannot get the version from MacPorts to work &mdash; it will not read from my SuperDrive.  Could someone please tell me how to clone a CD with a MacBook Pro under Mountain Lion?  <answer95047> Have you tried making image with Disk utility?  Details and pictures here:  http://www.wikihow.com/Copy-Your-DVDs-With-Mac-OS-X  <answer103319> It seems that "Burn" does the trick. Saving the image of a CD in "Raw" format will generate an ISO file along with an ISOINFO file. I figure using "Burn" again to burn the pair to a blank CD will reproduce the original pauses.  I have not verified the pauses, but the songs are definitely on the copy.  <answer192041> This solution works perfectly for me :      strong1) Create a disk image from source CD/strong      ul   liInsert the source CD (the one you want to copy)/li   liOpen the strongFinder/strong, open strongApplications/strong, then strongUtilities/strong, and start the strongDisk Utility/strong program/li   liIn Disk Utility, select strongFile/strong - strongNew/strong - strongDisk Image from Folder/strong/li   liThe Finder will appear – strongselect whole CD/strong and click on the strongImage/strong button/li   liA new dialog box will appear. In the Where box, choose strongDesktop/strong. In the Image Format box, choose strongDVD/CD master/strong/li   liClick strongSave/strong/li   /ul      Now a new file will be created on your Desktop, titled the name of your CD with a “.cdr” extension. This file is a disk image of your CD. Btw, it works even if you do not select cdr format and write disk as generic Disk Image (.dmg).      Now you need to burn it on new, blank CD:      strong2) Create new CD from a disk image/strong      ul   listrongEject/strong your original CD from the CD drive/li   liReturn to the strongDisk Utility/strong program./li   liYou should now see the disk image of your CD on the left hand side, typically at the bottom of the list. strongSelect the image/strong, and then click on the strongBurn/strong button/li   liFollow the directions and insert a blank CD-R disc when prompted/li   /ul   <answer221359> First, what does not work:  ol liSome people suggest emBurn/em, but it is no longer updated and does not work on modern versions of OS X./li liSome people suggest emLiquidCD/em, but it is no longer updated and does not work on modern versions of OS X./li liSome people suggest emDisk Utility/em, which is great for emDATA CDs/em but does not work for emAUDIO CDs/em because Audio CDs do not have a file system. Disk Utility (and hdiutil behind the scenes) cannot image raw Audio CDs because they have to write into a file system-based .dmg file. When you see an Audio CD mounted in Finder it is using the emcddafs/em convenience file system driver to present Audio CD tracks as playable .aiff files - this is not the raw Audio CD data and so when you image this view from Disk Utility's emDisk Image from Folder/em option you will often have messed up audio gaps. When you mount these .dmg files Finder windows will show you the .aiff audio files again, but iTunes will not recognize the mounted .dmg as an Audio CD and so will not give you the opportunity to rip it as if it were a normal Audio CD./li /ol  What does work? emcdrdao/em still works and is freely available through Macports (port install cdrdao) and Homebrew (brew install cdrdao).  I'm not a huge fan of emcdrdao/em but it is suitable for this particular task. It's too complex for the average user because (a) it requires use of the command line (which I'm comfortable with, but most people aren't); (b) it requires knowledge of two different sets of device names and (c) it requires that iTunes is not running because it locks Audio CDs in a way that prevents exclusive access.  NOTE: This whole process is a lot easier if you go to emSystem Preferences  CDs &amp; DVDs/em and set all options there to emIgnore/em. This should stop Finder, iTunes and other software from breaking things at the wrong times for you.  First up you need to know the /dev/disk(?) name of your optical device, since you're going to have to emumount/em it so that emcdrdao/em can get exclusive access to it, e.g.:  precode$ diskutil list  /dev/disk0    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            999.3 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3 /dev/disk3    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:        CD_partition_scheme Cool Music Disc...     *834.4 MB   disk3    1:                      CD_DA                         75.3 KB    disk3s0    2:                      CD_DA                         30.3 MB    disk3s1 ... /code/pre  In this case, /dev/disk3 is our USB-based optical device with an Audio CD inserted.

I've used it successfully many times [with a slight variation](https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/284956/73826) due to `ERROR: init: ObtainExclusiveAccess failed` issues. Main difference is that I have to unmount both before AND after scanbus <comment372320> Thank you, thank you - works perfectly although I had to overcome that 'init: ObtainExclusiveAccess' issue as well.
