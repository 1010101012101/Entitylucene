App thinning - Managing app versions with iTunes on iOS devices <body> Context:  ul liWith app thinning from iOS 9, iTunes does not transfer apps from iOS devices to the Mac (or PC)./li liI know that downloading apps in iTunes and syncing them to the iOS device is a way to keep apps on the computer./li liHowever, I update my apps directly on the iOS devices most of the time and use iTunes only once a week or so for backups, sync, etc./li liFor various reasons (including Internet connection speed, traffic limit, etc.), I'm not comfortable using iCloud backup./li liI'm fine with not having thinned, device specific app binaries on my devices. Space on the iOS devices is not an issue./li /ul  Problem:  ul liI want to be able to sync specific app versions to the iOS device, which may or may not be the latest app version on the app store, whenever I restore my device or move to a new device (newer versions of apps may include ads, add more in-app purchases for features that were free before, etc., which I'd like to avoid by managing the versions myself). The iTunes change with app thinning seems to make this impossible, given the above context./li liI do not wish to re-download all apps from the app store when restoring a device or moving to a new device./li /ul  Questions:  ul liIf I setup automatic downloads for apps in iTunes, will it download only new app purchases or will it also download updates to any apps that I have updated directly on the device? (I understand this will use additional network bandwidth if I update purchase/update apps on specific devices)/li liIf automatic downloads is not the solution for app updates, is there an easier way to keep specific versions of apps on the device without having to use iTunes for app updates and avoiding updating apps completely from the iOS devices? I really like the convenience of updating apps on the devices./li /ul
