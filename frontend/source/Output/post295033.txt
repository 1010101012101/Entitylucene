Extracting data from damaged time capsule <body> My Time Capsule is not working as it got short circuited and when I went to the Apple Service Center they told me that I need to replace it. They said I can't get my data back.  <comment372377> Are you looking to take the drive out? https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/268828/cannot-enter-time-machine-on-rescued-drive-from-dead-time-capsule <comment372378> If that is the last option to do. I will do it. <comment372381> Apple service won’t repair a drive, so they offer exchange. Hopefully it’s not the drive if you go that method. <comment372382> Ok.

If you're not comfortable doing that a computer repair shop probably would since it's a pretty routine tear down and hard drive recovery
