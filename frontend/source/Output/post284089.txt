Script Editor hangs / Applescripts no longer work since upgrading to Sierra <body> Since upgrading from El Capitan to Sierra, I've noticed my applescripts no longer work. They are causing Script Editor to be "not-responding" on startup of the app when opening a script. In addition, all applescripts involving "System Events" have changed all instances controlled by it:  keystroke lines have turned to this, for example:    «event prcskprs» "c" given «class faal»:command down  Multiple lines have changed themselves to include  «event prcskprs»  and «class pcap»:  tell application "System Events"  precodetell «class pcap» "Finder" /code/pre  used to be  tell application "System Events"  precodetell application process "Finder" /code/pre  This is how a script to with GUI-scripting now looks:  precode tell application "System Events"       tell «class prcs» "Notification Center"            «event prcsclic» «class radB» "Notifications" of «class rgrp» 1 of window "NotificationTableWindow"       end tell  end tell  /code/pre  I also periodically receive a message from Sierra asking me to include "SystemUIServer.app" to Accessibility in System Preferences  Security and Privacy. I have tried adding /System/Library/CoreServices/SystemUIServer.app, and it doesn't change anything.  strongI've noticed these three errors in Console when opening Script Editor with an applescript./strong Not sure how or if they are related:  Console shows this error under Process  Finder:  /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app/Content/MacOS/Finder    (/System/Library/Frameworks/Appkit.framework/Versions/AppKit/)  precode Subsystem: com.apple.AppKit      Category: General       Activity ID: 0 Thread ID: 0xdbb    PID: 312   &lt; private &gt; /code/pre  and this under Process  Script Editor:  Detected missing constraints for .  It cannot be placed because there are not enough constraints to fully define the size and origin. Add the missing constraints, or set translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints=YES and constraints will be generated for you. If this view is laid out manually on macOS 10.12 and later, you may choose to not call [super layout] from your override. Set a breakpoint on DETECTED_MISSING_CONSTRAINTS to debug. This error will only be logged once.  and this under Process  Script Editor:  ERROR: Setting  as the first responder for window , but it is in a different window ()! This would eventually crash when the view is freed. The first responder will be set to nil.    strongAnyone know what might be causing this?/strong  ..  ..  ..  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eFi4w.jpg" alt="enter image description here" (Screenshot of message)
