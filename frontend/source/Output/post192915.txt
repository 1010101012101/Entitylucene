Open the Settings app and go to “iCloud” 2. Scroll down under all the settings to find “Delete Account” (or “Sign Out”) and tap on that. 3. Confirm the removal of the iCloud account from the device by tapping on “Delete” or “Sign Out” <comment229745> Ok did that, and then I went to backup manually again and it still says the last backup could not be completed... <comment229746> Please ask a new question for the second part, this site works better with one question per post <comment229748> Then, do a reset on the phone by holding down the Home and lock buttons simultaneously until the unit reset.  Then, immediately do a backup to iCloud.. <comment229749> Ok, did that, didn't work. still says the same message.
