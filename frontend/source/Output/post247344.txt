Rate a track directly from Apple Music - stars / hearts vs My Music and syncing <body> I just bought my first Mac, started Apple Music subscription and moved my music library (1500 liked tracks) from spotify.  I'm trying to make some sense of rating system iTunes/Apple Music has and I think I need some clarifications.  ol liWhen I'm listening to a track on Apple Music I can heart it but I can't star-rate it./li liWhen I click on the same track and add it to My Music I can later find it in my collection on iTunes and I can see the heart. I can star-rate it./li liBut if I only heart it I can't find it in my music. It is necessary to do 2 interactions (heart&amp;add to My Music) to find track I like later./li liOn mobile (Apple Music for Android) I can heart a track, I can browse My Music collection, but I can't add a track to it./li liBut on mobile device I can add it to a playlist, so it appears in My Music collection./li /ol  What I'm trying to achieve is to be able to mark music I like from any device and be able to find it later from any device. Also, I like the feature to star rate tracks to distinct music I love from music I like.  So, my question is: stronghow to use starring/hearting/adding to my music correctly?*/strong   *preferably like Apple intended it to be used to avoid complications when some features are changed  <comment305227> http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/246498/are-album-ratings-gone-in-itunes/246501#246501 <comment305228> @TMHahn: I know about it and enabled it at first place, but it solves only "distinct music I love from music I like" part.
