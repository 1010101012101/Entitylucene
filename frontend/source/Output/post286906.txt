Android->iPhone->Android whatsapp history <body> I was using whatsapp on my Android phone, then had to switch to iPhone &amp; now I'm planning to go back to my Android.  I made a backup of iPhone with itunes, took whatsapp backup files out of it &amp; put them on my Android phone. I need both: chat &amp; media (videos, pictures &amp; etc).  What happened is that I've lost all the history before iPhone even though I can see that my backup on Google Drive is ~300Mb. I tried to delete whatsapp &amp; restore from there again, but looks like the corrupt/incorrectly merged backup files replaced the original ones &amp; there's no way to go back :( The good thing is that I've backed up my whatsapp on Android to another google account too :)  So what's the procedure to merge my old history from Android, my new history from iphone &amp; go back to Android with a complete history?  What free software did you use?  Thanks!
