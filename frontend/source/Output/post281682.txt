Mails missing after OSX 10.12.4 update <body> My mail app currently shows only 10 messages, where there should be 10.000. This happened after the update to OSX 10.12.4. The mail folder (~/Library/Mail) is about 8GB large, so the data is still there.  I tried rebuilding the mailbox (https://support.apple.com/kb/PH22339) I tried having spotlight reindex ~/Library/Mail (as suggested here https://www.cisdem.com/resource/how-to-restore-mail-folder.html)  Any suggestions for other things to try?
