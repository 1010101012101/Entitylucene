The backup on Server is already in use <body> I have OS X Mavericks with the Server software installed. The server machine is an iMac with a Drobo attached via USB. I use the Server Time Machine service to create a backup server on the network, using the Drobo as the storage device for backups.  I am currently backing-up two Macbooks to this Time Machine Server. Some backups will succeed but every other day or so, I will get an error on both laptops that the backup failed with the following reason: The backup on Server is already in use.  I have only been able to clear this problem by restarting the server.   Does anyone know why this might be occurring and what I might be able to do in order to prevent it from happening?  Thank you.  <answer117374> I have got this problem since I got my OS X Server, and still do get this error. Whenever my router disconnects, it causes this until I fix it. However, instead of restarting the server, there's a workaround:  ol liOpen Server.app (I do this on the client that I'm using, but you could do it on the server itself) and login./li liSelect the File Sharing service./li liGo to the Connected Users tab./li liSelect each connected user and click Disconnect./li /ol  I have to do this so often I wrote a Keyboard Maestro macro for this, but any scripting software would do this.  <answer117402> If disconnecting users "fixes" the problem then it's almost certainly somewhere in the AppleFileServer process.  Have a look at the AFP access and error logs and see if you can find a better error message than the one you get on the client Mac and you may well be closer to a solution. Click on codeLogs/code in the left hand pane of the Server app and then select codeAFP Error/code in the pop up below the log window.  The problem might also be with the RAID in the Drobo. Have you tried another hard drive just to see if the problem goes away? Which model Drobo is it? Drobo support mutters under its breath about Lion and Time Machine so may well also have problems with Mavericks and Time Machine. (I get around the problem by having a single 2TB drive with 3 partitions as my TM target and then back that up to my Drobo using Carbon Copy Cloner.)  <answer139079> Just for the completeness of this issue. If you land here and do not use MacOS Server, but a emSynology DiskStation/em, do the following:  ul liLogin to your DiskStation as root/li liOpen the main menu/li listart the coderesource monitor/code/li liswitch to codeconnected users/code/li liselect the blocked user and press codedisconnect/code/li /ul  <answer180950> I had a similar issue with my Synology NAS after having followed Synology's Time Machine guide.  When trying to connect to the Backup Disk, Time Machine said "You do not have the necessary read, write and append privileges on the selected network backup disk."   The only solution that worked for me was to restart Synology DSM by clicking on the person/user icon in the top right and selecting "Restart"  <answer209738> If you get the error message "Time Machine could not complete the backup. The backup disk image “/Volumes/mac-backups-1/machine-name.sparsebundle” is already in use." and you are using a Synology DiskStation DSM 5.2 (NAS) as the destination for Time Machine backups, the following steps resolved the issue:  ol liLogin to your DiskStation as admin/li liSelect the Options icon (at the top right -- looks like a person's head) /li liOptions  Account  Account Activity  Connected Users /li liFor each user on AFP Service and Resource: mac-backups, press disconnect (red circle with white horizontal bar).  The issues seems to be that there are two or more connected users both connected to AFP  Resource: mac-backups.  There should only be one. /li liClick Refresh.  There should now only be one user connected to AFP  Resource: mac-backups. /li liOn your MacBook  Time Machine icon  Start Backup.  Time Machine backup begins (circling counterclockwise) and you no longer get the above error message./li /ol  I am not sure exactly how this situation occurs, but here is my theory: After disconnecting the MacBook and reconnecting to another network (moving my MacBook to another location while traveling), the connection to the synology resource: mac-backups (used by Time Machine) did not get properly disconnected, so when the machine was reintroduced into the network, another new connection was established, even though the existing connection was still present, creating a conflict and the subject error message.  To Be Tested: To prevent this error from happening again, if Time Machine is in-progress doing a backup, try doing a "Stop Backing Up" command in Time Machine before moving your MacBook to another location off-network.  Hopefully, when you bring the machine back to the network where the synology NAS is located, the error should no longer occur.  <answer245669> @grgarside is on the money - this happens when there are two connections to the backup from the same IP.   On my network I stopped it from happening by disabling guest access to the backup drive(s).   On the server machine,   ul liLogin to OS X Server /li liclick File Sharing/li liclick on the settings tab/li liselect the backup drive in question/li liuncheck the box Enable Guest Access/li liclick the connections tab/li lithen disconnect all users. /li /ul  Login to the server on the client machine again and you're good to go. Once guest access was disabled, the client won't automatically connect to the server using the guest protocol, thus preventing multiple connections.   <comment137179> If that works have you tried just bouncing the AFP process with `sudo launchctl stop com.apple.AppleFileServer` followed by `sudo launchctl start com.apple.AppleFileServer` ? <comment137187> Thanks for the suggestions. Disconnecting users does allow me to recover from the error, but doesn't prevent the problem from occurring again. My goal is to stop the error from occurring. @TonyWilliams I'd rather not restart the apple file server as I'm concerned it might interrupt other backups in progress. <comment137192> That wasn't so much a "solution" as a possible diagnosis step :) <comment137196> killall AppleFileServer does recover. I do this myself.  Unfortunately I have not found a way to prevent the problem. <comment212344> I didn't find the above answer until after I fixed the problem, but on Synology DSM 5.1, I found that disabling and re-enabling the AFP service also makes the error go away. <comment214919> I used this solution on a Synology DSM 5.1 - Thanks mana! <comment284190> The above answer didn't fix my problem, the only connected user it showed was me logged in to the admin page. However, @ScottDudley's suggestion worked great, thanks Scott! <comment329617> @ScottDudley Same here, just needed to check/uncheck AFP service. No need to do the above as root. <comment353336> So basically this also means: restart netatalkd if you're running any other NAS based on this. Helped with pure netatalk, too. <comment373192> Thanks, this worked for me! I had two connections through AFP that was causing the issue.
