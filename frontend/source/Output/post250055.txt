Use 27" Thunderbolt Display with iMac <body> I have an old MacBook Pro (2011) which I use with an external 27" Thunderbolt Display. I'm now thinking about getting a new iMac. Is it possible to connect my Thunderbolt Display to the iMac as a secondary screen?  <answer250057> New iMac do have a thunderbolt port(not sure which model is the oldest that have one), it should have the thunderbolt port required for the display to work.  <answer250072> Any Mac made in 2011 or newer has the Thunderbolt port needed to use this, so any new iMac would work fine.
