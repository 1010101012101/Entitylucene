Why when I plug my iPhone or iPod in, it asks me if I trust this computer? <body> When I plug my iTouch device in, whether it be an iPod or iPhone, and use it, my computer asks me if I trust this computer?   And if I keep clicking trust the prompt/box keeps popping up. It only goes away when I tap don't trust.   <comment175393> This happens to me. However, usually after a few time of taping trust. It just quits asking me.
