Video playback app for iOS 6 that's like iOS 7's Videos.app? <body> Is there an iOS 6-compatible app that's just like the iOS 7 Videos.app? I have tried VLC but I want an app that displays the contents of my video library as both text and thumbnails the way the the Videos.app does.  <answer140249> VLC for iPhone works from iOS 6.1?  If that's fine, heres the link:  https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/vlc-for-ios/id650377962?mt=8  Movie Player works from iOS 5.1, here's the link:  https://itunes.apple.com/ae/app/movie-player-plays-any-video!/id406779775?mt=8  <comment165326> Hi and welcome to Ask Different!
