Can Address Book still store local groups or contacts with iCloud enabled? <body> I want to be able to keep a group of contacts on my Mac emonly/em, while keeping the rest of them synched to iCloud (as they currently do).  A bit of background: I'm wanting to do this since I'm dabbling with a bit of scripting involving the Address Book, and I want to be able to create test contacts without disrupting my real Address Book, and risking the wrath of the sync gods. My workaround has been using a second account that only has local storage, but it's disruptive having to switch accounts to test something.  The Address Book preferences has an emOn My Mac/em account listed alongside my iCloud account, but I don't see any options when creating new contacts or groups for putting them in local storage. If I reveal the groups pane, new groups get put under the iCloud section, and I don't see any local/On My Mac section.  Is the emOn My Mac/em account a mirage, not actually accessible if you have iCloud enabled?  <answer83479> Here's a Mountain Lion solution that I hope works on Lion. (I just worked at this from the other way - wanting to banish forever the strongOn My Mac/strong group.)  ul liOpen Contacts/li liSelect On My Mac as the default account./li liImport a contact or two from a vCard or import your test data set from the strongImportâ€¦/strong menu/li liSwitch back your default account to iCloud./li /ul  Going forward you can always drag a .vcf / vCard file into the strongOn My Mac/strong list to import there directly without changing the default account.  <comment96104> Nice, this appears to do what I was trying. I've switched to all 10.8 now, so I can't immediately check if it works for Lion as well (although I don't remember Lion having a default option). <comment96108> Nice - we could edit the question and leave things up in the air for anyone still on Lion - your call on that. Glad it helped.
