Can Karabiner define shortcuts to (nested) menu items? <body> Does Karabiner have the option to define a keycode corresponding to a (possibly nested) menu item? I searched the Karabiner documentation, but didn't find a clear answer.  I know that this function exists OSX natively, via Settings  Keyboard  App shortcuts. The problem with that is that in some cases, the shortcut doesn't work until I the menu item has been opened at least once 'manually', i.e. by selecting the corresponding menu by mouse, and opening all the sub-menus until the nested command is visible. This problem occurs for example with my OSX shortcut for a nested menu item in TextMate.  So I'm wondering if the same function exists in Karabiner? Or, if Karabiner cannot do it, but another key remapping software can, I'd be interested to try it.   Alternatively, if someone can think of a fix for the 'shortcut to nested item not working immediately' problem described above, that would work as well.  <comment320957> Karabiner cannot set shortcuts for menu items like that, no.
