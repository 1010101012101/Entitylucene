Triple booting Ubuntu using standard Apple bootloader (NOT rEFInd) <body> I followed these instructions exactly (minus creating a swap and shared data partition) for setting up triple boot on my MacBook Pro (mid 2015 model) up until the point where I was instructed to install rEFInd. I thought that I wouldn't need to install it due to this line:     strongemPostcondition:/strong You have a Mac which can boot to OSX, Windows 10 and Linux by pressing the Alt key during boot./em   But when I rebooted from linux and held down the alt (option) key, I was met with the usual two choices of Mac OSX or Windows 10. Basically, I need to know how to get the Apple bootloader to recognize the 'ubuntu' folder on my EFI partition and show it as an option to boot into (which will then activate GRUB2, booting into Ubuntu.) At the moment, I am booting into Ubuntu using rEFInd and using the alt (option) key to boot into Windows 10 or Mac OSX - but if I'm able to just use the Apple bootloader then I would much rather this because it's way cleaner.
