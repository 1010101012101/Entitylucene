Transferring text messages with upgrade from iPhone 4 to iPhone 5 <body> My text messages did not transfer. Is there a way to get them yet? They are still on the old phone.  <answer90442> I would get a program like PhoneView and just archive both device's SMS/Voicemail/call records. Unless the new phone is really new and you don't mind losing the new texts to restore a backup of all the texts from the old, there's not a way to inject or combine both stores of text messages.  <answer90763> You have to first back up the old iphone 4, then restore the new iphone 5 to this backup, which contains your messages.To prevent from losing any data that only exist on your new iphone 5 but not on the old one, you should save these data before you do the backup and restore, because this will revert all settings and datas.  <comment106161> Can you erase the new phone and do a back up / restore from the old phone? <comment106163> Possibly, but would I lose any information in the process? <comment106164> You would lose everything on the new phone that's not synced elsewhere. Apps, contacts, music, books - all that can sync - but you'd lose the new messages since they don't get mixed (you can't combine parts of two back up events or devices).
