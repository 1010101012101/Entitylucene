emails automatically marked as read iphone ios10 filter Functionality <body> When I am in the native ios 10 email app and that I activate the filter button on the bottom left to unread emails... I read one then on its own like by magic it goes through other emails unread and mark them read at the rate of 1 per second!  If I don't click the back button it would not stop... how can I prevent this happening please?  Thank you
