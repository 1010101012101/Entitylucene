I want to keep my old text messages. They document old events and conversations with friends.  I now have a new iPhone and want to give this one to my daughter.  What happens when she puts a new sim card in?    I'm trying to save the texts via screenshots, but it's taking a long time and she needs to use the phone.  Thanks for any help.  <answer255099> No, previous messages are stored locally on the device, not the SIM card, so installing a new SIM card will not remove the previous messages.  <comment317790> Terrific!  Thank you.
