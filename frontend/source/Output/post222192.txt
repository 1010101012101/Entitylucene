Why Do My Apple In-Ear HeadPhones Crackle on the Higher Notes? <body> I just got a pair of the Apple In-Ear HeadPhones for Christmas, and have been really impressed by their sound quality thus far. However, today while using the HeadPhones I noticed that they have started this weird crackling sound with high notes. It only seems to affect notes higher on the treble clef, but the bass sounds fine (better than my old EarPods in fact). I took them out and cleaned the tips, and I kinda wiped off the mesh caps, but it didn't seem to help. I am hesitant to use the spare mesh caps, because they're so new, and I don't think they should need replacing yet. I can't dish out however much money the spare mesh caps cost every two weeks! Has anyone else had this problem, and have they found a solution? They're too expensive and new to be busted already. Right?  hr  Well, after being forced to use my old crummy EarPods for the first time in a whole week for about 40 minutes, I had to try something. So I restarted my iPod touch 6th Generation that is the only phone-like device I own. I was disappointed to find that there was no difference. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  <comment269181> Sometimes earbuds just do that. Has only happened to me once, and you can't really fix it, as far as I'm aware of. Have you tried them in a different device? Maybe the device you are using has some issue. <comment269186> @FlareCat Well, I am using an iPod touch 6th Gen, relatively new, but all I have in the way of iThings. I might try on a relative's device. But I have tried using my old Apple EarPods, and they work fine, so I don't think it's the device. I know in iOS 9 the device keeps track of different audio devices, so I'll try a restart. <comment269194> How old are they? If they are new my suggestion would be to go to an Apple store and say, “These are new and now they crackle.” 99% sure they will simply take your current pair and give you a new set of headphones right off of the shelf. They cost like less than $10 a pair for Apple to make. And if they are old? Could just be normal usage degradation; meaning you blew them out and that’s the crackle you hear. <comment269217> @JakeGould , oldboy in his opening stated "I just got a pair of the Apple In-Ear HeadPhones for Christmas", so logically assuming that's the one just past then they are very new and should be under warranty.  Also do you have any corroborating source to your statement "They cost like less than $10 a pair for Apple to make"? <comment269220> @user3439894 No I don’t have any evidence about the $10 a pair claim. But in most Apple stores the policy is to just swap things like this—even if they are nonstandard headphones—for a new item without question. It happens fairly regularly but is not official policy. Thus why I didn’t post an answer. <comment269225> @user3439894 Well, as long as we're splitting hairs, my user name is oboy.¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ <comment269229> @oboy, It was a typo. <comment269232> @user3439894 I know, I was pulling your leg. Typos happen to the best of us! And anyway, where is AutoCorrect when you need it? Probably sniffing flowers, catching up on Spongebob episodes and eating a whole mess o' canned peaches. With those disgusting little pickled pineapples and... ugh.
