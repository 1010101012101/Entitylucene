How to access other users' files via Terminal in OS X? <body> I am an admin that wants to access other users' files. How to do this via the Terminal?   <answer164679> The home folders of all users are stored in code/Users/code. Assuming you have the technical and legal rights to access files of other users, you can do this by changing into their home folder (codecd /Users/joe/code or codecd ~joe/code) and accessing the files there.  <answer164715> As stated by patrix: the personal files of other user's on the same machine are generally stored in the code/Users/&lt;username&gt;/code folder for each user. The permissions on these folders are usually set such that they are private to the individual who owns the files.  This means you need to use sudo to elevate your own access levels in order to see their files. If you are truly an admin, using codesudo/code is something that's ok, but do so with caution. If you are not an admin then you shouldn't have the proper codesudo/code privileges to do any of this and your repeated attempts to use codesudo/code are logged in the system access log.  To simply list files in another user's home directory (let's call them codebob/code) you do:  precodesudo ls ~bob /code/pre  The code~/code prefix is POSIX shorthand for "home directory of...". To browse freely, you can embecome/em that user with codesudo/code like so:  precodesudo su - bob /code/pre  This makes you codebob/code, logged in as codebob/code and in codebob/code's home directory. You can now move around, codecat/code files, codeopen/code files, etc. as codebob/code.  <comment193127> Strangely enough I cannot access the files even though I am admin on the computer. <comment193128> Then you don't have the technical rights to do so (check folder permissions to verify). <comment193129> @LoveLearning Even admin users do not have access rights to other users folders in Terminal. You can invoke `sudo` privileges to access them provided, as patrix said, you have technical and legal rights to do so. <comment193196> Yes I have all rights. I was just too lazy to log out and then in again to the other user where I had saved a PDF   file. <comment193198> When I become Bob, do I have to write su for each command?  Can I move files to my account? <comment193204> Once you become `bob` with `sudo su - bob` you no longer need to prefix each command with `sudo`. You are `bob` at that point and can see anything `bob` is allowed to see. To move files to your account it's best to do it with `sudo`. Like: `sudo cp -r ~bob/Documents/Some\ Folder ~/Documents/` to copy `Some Folder` in `bob`'s documents to your `Documents` folder.
