iPhone 6s won't update any software <body> Every time new software is released by Apple for my iPhone 6s, I go to emSettings/em to see the latest version that needs to be updated, but as soon as I click on emUpdate/em, it closes out the emSettings App./em I have done a hard reset but nothing works. Can someone give me some advice on what could be causing this?  Thank you.  <comment293906> If that happens each time, and you've restarted your iPhone, you could try a network reset. If that doesn't work you're probably looking at reinstalling iOS on the iPhone. <comment293912> Can you try upgrading while physically connected via USB? <comment293989> As Jim Garrison points out, try connecting your iPhone to a Mac, then open up iTunes, go to your device, and hit upgrade software. That should help you out.
