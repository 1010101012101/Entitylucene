iOS: Bluetooth LE background app <body> I severly suffer from iOS (supposedly) killing my apps all the time although I purpusefully do not kill them. They are also listed in the task manager (double tap on home).  This is especially bad for at least two of my apps:  ol liHID Mobile Access (keyless entry system)/li liNoke (Bluetooth pad lock)/li /ol  For the former, all that should need to be done is to shake the phone. Then card reader should activate and open the door. For the latter, only the shackle of the pad lock should have to be pushed and it should automatically unlock if the phone is nearby (i.e., in my pocket).  BOTH nearly never work, rendering them nearly useless (if I need to dig into my bag to find the phone I can also dig for the key or the RFID card).  Both work when I manually start the app (and shortly after) but then randomy fail again after some time.  Both apps have a background app refresh option which I have activated.  The developers of the apps claim that this would be a limitation of iOS and the functionality would not work. I would fine it bold to advertise a functionality that can't even work ...  Shouldn't background app refresh allowing exactly this ... keeping those kinds of things working?  I also have an Apple Watch and there I never experienced communication loss or problems.  How does the background app refresh work exactly for Bluetooth LE? Is there a function to probe for a Bluetooth LE device in the background?  Are the developers of these apps just making up excuses?  (Tile is another Bluetooth LE app with the same problems. However, here I don't mind too much)
