iOS 10.1.1 random BT disconnection problem on iPhone 5c <body> I have 10.1.1 on my iPhone 5c. Before I upgraded to 9.X, I experienced 0 Bluetooth issues. Since 9.X, the BT connection icon toggles on and off randomly. This disconnects my Oticon Streamer (Hearing Aids), which interrupts calls and GPS communication from my phone. If i am listening to music through the phone, again, 0 disconnects. In fact, I discovered that if I connect to Pandora before I leave the office, then set up the GPS, it stays connected for my 45 minute ride. Otherwise, NG. Can't use BT for calls, keeps disconnecting. If BT is on, and connected to the Streamer (without a phone call or Pandora), my phone screen lights up randomly, indicating that BT is connected, then it lights up again when it disconnects, killing my battery in a few hours. ARG!  <comment340796> Also, spent at least 2 hours on phone convo with Apple HD supervisor for Handicapped Assistance (Brittany). Very nice and understanding, but could not help. We did ever sort of reset available on the phone.
