Why does iMovie make my movie so small in size? <body> I have an iOS game coming up and I made a trailer today. I recorded gameplay footage from my iPhone 6 device onto QuickTime and then edited the footage in iMovie. When I started editing, the footage in iMovie is about 1 inch in height. Then I thought maybe that's just the way it is it iMovie. When I uploaded the footage on Facebook, the video is also about 1 inch in size. How do I make it bigger? The iPhone 6 footage that I recorded on QuickTime takes up half the size of the MacBook Pro screen. Why does that footage become 1 inch long on iMovie and then it exports that 1 inch long footage to Facebook. I tried changing various sizes when I exported from iMovie and it video stayed 1 inch in height.  <comment252842> Instead of inches, can you please measure by pixels. If you press command-i in QuickTime with the video open, you can see the dimensions of the video.
