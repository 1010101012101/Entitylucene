Use downloaded Git instead of preinstalled Git <body> I am following the Lynda.com Git Essential Training. After he downloads and installs Git he enters codewhich git/code and gets code/usr/local/git/bin/git/code However when I do it I still get the preinstalled path code/usr/bin/git/code  How do I change the path so I am working with my downloaded version of Git  I am using a Macbook Air - Mavericks - OS X 10.9.4 and followed the default install instructions.  <answer138859> Add the following to your ~/.bash_profile  precodeexport PATH=/usr/local/git/bin:$PATH /code/pre  <answer139096> I use Homebrew, then install git using Homebrew.  This makes sure that git stays on my path, and makes it easy for me to keep git up-to-date, as well as making it easy to install other software, with its dependencies.  To install things with Homebrew, you first need to install the Xcode Command Line Tools.  StackOverflow has a great answer on installing the command line tools on OSX 10.9.  After you have installed the Xcode Command Line Tools, you may notice that there is a git command you can use: see Does installing Command Line Tools for Xcode also install Git? That is not the Homebrew version of git, so it doesn't track updates.  Next, go to http://brew.sh and follow their directions for installing Homebrew.  That will install git into the Homebrew directory, and link git to code/usr/local/bin/git/code.  code/usr/local/bin/code should end up on your PATH before code/usr/local/git/code, so you will end up using the Homebrew version of git.  After that, you can install anything for which Homebrew has a formula, including the latest versions of git. Use codebrew update/code to keep your index of available packages up to date, and codebrew doctor/code to verify that your Homebrew configuration is correct.  Then you can use codebrew upgrade git/code to keep your git at the latest version available to Homebrew.   <comment163805> There is also a Mac specific way to set paths:  http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/106355/setting-the-system-wide-path-environment-variable-in-mavericks <comment163810> I get the following after running which git /usr/local/git/bin//git  Is the double forward slash ok? <comment163812> @Pierce Oops, left a trailing slashâ€”fixed
