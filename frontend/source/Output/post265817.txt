Change the iOS double tap home button reachabity predefined function <body> I would like to set the double tap on the home button on the iPhone 6s as a click on the same home button. Has anybody done this?   <answer265832> This isn't possible without jailbreaking. Apple does not provide any mechanism for changing the functionality of the double tap.  If the device is jailbroken, you can install Activator 1.9.11 beta 2 which has support for the ‘Double Press’ Touch ID event. This event can be mapped to ‘Home Button’, such that ‘touch fingerprint sensor twice’ will ‘simulate a press of the home button’.  <comment333320> Even if possible, that would mean you would have to move the 'close app' function to another command. <comment333325> That is just what I would like to do with the double tap. Close the current app as clicking.
