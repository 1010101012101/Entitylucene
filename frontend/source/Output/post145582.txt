How to display the current mapping for keyboard shortcuts in realtime? <body> Is there an app / script which will listen for keyboard events and display the action that is triggered?  I use Better Touch Tool, and want to run a script on kbdCmd/kbd+kbdF1/kbd but I got the message:     The key combination "Command + F1" can't be used because it's already used by a system-wide keyboard shortcut. (If you really want to use this key combination, most shortcuts can be changed in the Keyboard &amp; Mouse panel in System Preferences.)   I couldn't find the triggered action until I did a text search on http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1343, and now I'm curious!   In Sublime Text, it's possible to open Sublime's python terminal and codesublime.log_commands(True)/code to log commands triggered as the keys are pressed… is there something similar for system wide key events?  <answer145583> Woohoo! After some more looking, I've found https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/ which does everything I want! Please let me know if there's a lighter-weight alternative…  hr  To see keyboard events using Karabiner:   ul liopen the app/li lienable Karabiner under System Prefs  Accessibility/li li(maybe restart the AX notifier)/li liclick the icon in the menu bar (near the time)/li liselect strongLaunch EventViewer/strong/li /ul  The event viewer will show a log of events like:  precodeeventType:FlagsChanged    code:0x37       name:Command_L       flags:Cmd                                misc:KeyCode::COMMAND_L  characters:     eventType:FlagsChanged    code:0x37       name:Command_L       flags:                                   misc:KeyCode::COMMAND_L  characters:     eventType:SysKeyDown      code:0x1        name:                flags:                                   misc:ConsumerKeyCode::VOLUME_DOWN eventType:SysKeyUp        code:0x1        name:                flags:                                   misc:ConsumerKeyCode::VOLUME_DOWN eventType:SysKeyDown      code:0x0        name:                flags:                                   misc:ConsumerKeyCode::VOLUME_UP eventType:SysKeyUp        code:0x0        name:                flags:                                   misc:ConsumerKeyCode::VOLUME_UP /code/pre  (scroll right to see the flags)  It may be useful to click the Preferences tab in EventViewer to 'always show on top' and uncheck 'hide ignorable events'.  <answer205261> This program shows all keyboard shortcuts that use the ⌘ (command) key, just by pressing and holding command. http://www.cheatsheetapp.com/CheatSheet/  It does not show shortcuts that do not include command, but is quick and easy to use.  <answer205296> I use KeyCue. It's similar to @avv's recommendation but more customisable.   <comment248044> oops.. i didn't select an answer! points for first - all the suggestions here look good. <comment310789> How do you show the bounded key through karabiner? <comment310857> @AgafadaEm - I've added instructions for you, hope that helps!
