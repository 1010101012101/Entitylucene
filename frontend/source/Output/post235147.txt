import file view on Mac El Capitan Not there <body> Not sure what this view is called but when importing a file from computer to the internet I no longer have this type of viewing option (see photo), is there way to have it appear this way?   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CPjts.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer235149> Apple has removed Cover Flow view from Open file dialog.  As a workaround use a separate Finder window with Cover Flow view to locate your file in and then drag&amp;drop the file into an open Open file dialog in your browser. The Open file dialog will then switch to the folder containing the file you dropped and highlight it.   <comment287582> Quicklook is the tool that generates finder previews. Are you downloading a file that when you select it in Finder and press space, no preview is generated? (Or is this more how to configure finder's controls to show a preview for a file that works when manually triggered?) <comment287584> You are probably talking about the Open dialog here (which AFAIK doesn't have a CoverFlow option). Can you add a screenshot showing the problem (aka the window you see when you try to "import a file from computer to the internet")? <comment287588> Not that I ever use it, which is why I probably never noticed, but did that disappear with El Capitan? <comment287589> Yes, in El Capitan. It seems like Apple is phasing out Cover Flow. They had a patent troll litigation about this technology a few years back, and Apple won. But since then Cover Flow has been removed from iTunes and now from Open file dialog.
