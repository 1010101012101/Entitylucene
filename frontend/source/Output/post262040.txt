Early 2013 MBPr crashes when plugging in Galaxy S7 Edge to USB <body> This is a problem that I have just encountered. I think it may be a problem with macOS Sierra because I never experienced it with El Capitan. The computer will crash and restart and the error report that the computer shows says something about a USB Registry Error in the backtrace that is displayed. I found some resources online that said to make sure Android File Transfer or Samsung Smart Switch are installed, but I already had both.  I'm curious if anyone else has experienced this problem or what a potential fix might be?
