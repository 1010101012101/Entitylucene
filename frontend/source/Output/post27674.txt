How can I listen to free radio on an iPhone? <body> Is it possible to listen to the radio for free on the iPhone?   Do I need a special app?   I have downloaded some apps for digital radio that require payment, but I just want to listen to regular free radio  <answer27675> If you're referring to normal, terrestrial radio such as you'd get in your car or a cheap clock radio, the answer is that you cannot. At least, not without buying a receiver, something like this Griffin radio receiver.  <answer27691> There are radio apps in the iPhone app store that will give you radio stations in your area and elsewhere.  <answer27694> At the risk of stating the obvious, you can listen to Pandora—eminternet/em radio—for free on your iPhone.  And for a small fee you can listen without advertisements.   <answer27695> There's a good radio app called Tunein Radio Pro which allows you to listen to over 50,000 radio stations across the world and which is cheap to buy, $0.99 in the US.  There's also a non-Pro version which is free.  <comment31746> Apologies, I approved your edit after the question had already been migrated because I checked in the wrong order. I have however edited this one already. <comment31747> And your edit is approved. <comment31748> Appreciated and Thank You :)
