AT&T iPhone 5c/s LTE compatibility abroad? <body> According to Apple's official LTE page, the AT&amp;T iPhone 5c/s (A1532/A1533) don't officially support any European countries. But the only difference between the A1532/A1533 and the European A1507/A1457 is support for band 7, which according to Wikipedia's LTE tables is only emreally/em required in a couple of countries like Brazil. Most European countries seem to support 3 and 20 in addition to 7, which A1532/A1533 have.  What's the reason behind this, and has anyone tested their AT&amp;T iPhone 5c/s abroad for LTE support?
