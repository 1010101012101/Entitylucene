Touchbar MBP and daisy chain 2 Dell U2715h results in mirrored display <body> I've got a 13" MBP late 2016 (the first with the touchbar). I've also got two Dell U2715h daisy chained. The issue is that the U2715h's are being mirrored, and macOS isn't detecting multiple displays.  I've searched for an answer, turned on Dp 1.2 on both displays and tried swapping "master". It seems like everything should be working, but it's not. Hopefully not it's not the usb-c to displayport adapter I've got since it seems to be the only one on the swedish market.
