Starting and stopping mysql server. Shorten and make automatic <body> Currently I start and stop mysql with the following command    pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codesudo /usr/local/mysql/support-files/mysql.server start /code/pre    pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codesudo /usr/local/mysql/support-files/mysql.server stop /code/pre  It is quite a long command to remember.  How can I set it up so that I can start and stop it with a single command.  Something like.  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codesudo mysql-server start /code/pre  I am thinking I would need to crete a symbolic link somewhere for this to work?  Also one last option; how can I make it so that it runs on bootup by default?  <answer202417> Just create an alias in your ~/.bash_profile or ~/.profile file.  Check with codels -la0 ~//code if one of the files already exist, else create one with:  precodetouch ~/.bash_profile /code/pre  After opening .bash_profile with codenano ~/.bash_profile/code add the lines:  precodealias iwanttostartmysqlwithareallyshortcommand='sudo /usr/local/mysql/support-files/mysql.server start' alias iwanttostopmysqlwithareallyshortcommand='sudo /usr/local/mysql/support-files/mysql.server stop' /code/pre  write the file to disk with kbdctrl/kbdkbdO/kbd and exit nano with kbdctrl/kbdkbdX/kbd.  Then enter:  precodesource .bash_profile /code/pre  In the future you just have to enter   precodeiwanttostartmysqlwithareallyshortcommand /code/pre  or  precodeiwanttostopmysqlwithareallyshortcommand /code/pre  to start or stop mysql after entering your password.  A shorter alias like codeiwanttostartmysqlnow/code works also. Even really, really short ones are possible like codestm/code (= strongst/strongart strongm/strongysql) or codespm/code (= strongs/strongtostrongp/strong strongm/strongysql). They mustn't collide with other aliases or valid commands though. The shortest I have found - and easy to remember - are code1/code to start and code0/code to stop mysql. ;-)  hr  To answer your second question:  If you have installed the latest MySQL from Oracle a launch daemon should have been installed in /Library/LaunchDaemons already.  If you have installed another mysql package (e.g. homebrew) you may use the example here and adapt it.  Slightly modified example:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt;   &lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;RunAtLoad&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;true/&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;com.mysql.mysqld&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;array&gt;     &lt;string&gt;/usr/local/mysql/support-files/mysql.server start&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;/array&gt;   &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  Save the XML as a file named /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.mysql.mysql.plist  Adjust the file permissions using the Apple recommended owner "root", owning group "wheel", and file permissions "644"  precodesudo chown root:wheel /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.mysql.mysql.plist sudo chmod 644 /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.mysql.mysql.plist /code/pre  Enable this new MySQL service with:  precodesudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.mysql.mysql.plist /code/pre  <answer202427> I like the alias answer.  This is another route I found whilst looking.    pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codesudo ln -s /usr/local/mysql/support-files/mysql.server /usr/bin/mysql.server /code/pre  can now stop and start with  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codesudo mysql.server start /code/pre    pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codesudo mysql.server stop /code/pre  <comment253514> You should not add/alter files in /usr/bin as part of the OS and Apple can add or remove them and in El Capitan they have made it difficult to do <comment253520> what alternative do you propose? <comment253521> The other answer - or link to /usr/local/bin
