Unable to install profiles to Apple TV 4th gen <body> I'm trying to add a configuration profile to my Apple TV via Apple Configurator 2, as documented, however when I add the profile I get this error:      strongAn unexpected error has occurred with “Apple TV”./strong      You cannot install apps or other media on Apple TV.br   [ConfigurationUtilityKit.error – 0x3E9 (1001)]   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LDZn8.png" alt="enter image description here"  In fact, whenever I try to do any management of the Apple TV through Apple Configurator, it fails with the same message.  I've tried:  ul liI've tried clearing the configuration files (at code~/Library/Containers/com.apple.configurator.*/code)/li liUpdating and reinstalling Apple Configurator/li liRestarting computer/li liFull factory restore of Apple TV/li liFresh OS X install (on external hard drive)/li /ul  I'm able to sideload apps through Xcode through the same Mac, so that implies that the USB cable is fine.  <answer227016> I found something with similar issues on this thread:  https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/21638     Process  Perform all Mac updates  reboot   then open the apple   configurator again  select store at the top  sign in with apple id.   While it applies to deploying Apps to iPads, the Apple TV runs iOS so the solution may be the same.
