automount problems <body> I have a Yosemite Mac Mini with performance problems. When looking at the disk activity with codeopensnoop/code I noticed that automount is performing tons of accesses as follows  precode  UID    PID COMM          FD PATH     0   1124 automountd     4 /etc/auto_home     0   1124 automountd     6 /etc/auto_home     0  55536 od_user_homes   5 /System/Library/OpenDirectory/request-schema.plist     0  55536 od_user_homes   7 /usr/libexec     0  55536 od_user_homes   7 /usr/libexec     0  55536 od_user_homes   7 /usr/libexec/od_user_homes     0   1124 automountd     4 /etc/auto_home     0   1124 automountd     6 /etc/auto_home     0   1124 automountd     6 /usr/libexec/od_user_homes   501    464 syncdefaultsd   4 /Users/corti/Library/SyncedPreferences/.dat01d0.559     0   1124 automountd     6 /usr/libexec/od_user_homes     0     58 opendirectoryd   9 /var/db/dslocal/nodes//Default/users/corti.plist     0  55537 od_user_homes   5 /System/Library/OpenDirectory/request-schema.plist     0  55537 od_user_homes   7 /usr/libexec     0  55537 od_user_homes   7 /usr/libexec     0  55537 od_user_homes   7 /usr/libexec/od_user_homes     0     58 opendirectoryd   9 /var/db/dslocal/nodes//Default/users/corti.plist     0  55538 od_user_homes   5 /System/Library/OpenDirectory/request-schema.plist     0  55538 od_user_homes   7 /usr/libexec     0  55538 od_user_homes   7 /usr/libexec/od_user_homes     0  55539 od_user_homes   5 /System/Library/OpenDirectory/request-schema.plist     0  55539 od_user_homes   7 /usr/libexec     0  55539 od_user_homes   7 /usr/libexec     0   1124 automountd     4 /etc/auto_home     0   1124 automountd     6 /etc/auto_home     0   1124 automountd     6 /usr/libexec/od_user_homes     0  55540 od_user_homes   5 /System/Library/OpenDirectory/request-schema.plist     0  55540 od_user_homes   7 /usr/libexec     0  55540 od_user_homes   7 /usr/libexec     0   1124 automountd     4 /etc/auto_home     0   1124 automountd     6 /etc/auto_home     0   1124 automountd     6 /usr/libexec/od_user_homes     0  55541 od_user_homes   5 /System/Library/OpenDirectory/request-schema.plist     0  55541 od_user_homes   7 /usr/libexec     0  55541 od_user_homes   7 /usr/libexec     0  55541 od_user_homes   7 /usr/libexec/od_user_homes /code/pre  Hundreds of access per second. Is this normal? What could be wrong?  <answer163029> It seems that it was a combination of Dropbox and broken symlinks (see opendirectoryd consumes 40% of CPU and opendirectoryd taking up 1/4 of the cpu and driving fans crazy on MacBook Air).  I recently moved some old files from a Linux machine to my Mac Mini with around 10 broken symlinks to code/home/...//code (in a Dropbox synchronized directory). Dropbox was causing codeopendirectoryd/code to continuously trying to mount code/home//code.  I removed the broken links and the machine seems now stable.  <comment190662> Please more fully describe your Open Directory networking setup: number of clients/servers & Mac OS X versions on each machine. How many volumes are being served? <comment190663> @IconDaemon I have one single machine and never configured anything special. Where should I look? <comment190667> If this is a stand-alone machine, then things are very odd. In System Preferences  Users & Groups  Login Options, click the **Network Account Server: Join** button. In the drop-down sheet, click the Open Directory Utility... button. Click the Lock icon and authenticate. Open and inspect each service. **Active Directory**: No Active Directory Domain should be defined; **LDAPv3**: Show options and there should be no configurations defined; **NIS** No Domain name should be defined. If you find any servers defined, delete them. <comment190668> @IconDaemon Server dropdown is empty. The Directory Utility shows: AD (Forest automatic, and no domain), LDAP empty and NIS empty. As far as I know there are no directory servers that could be automatically discovered: it's a home network with private addresses. <comment190671> Perhaps the file /System/Library/OpenDirectory/request-schema.plist is corrupted somehow. Try moving it out of its directory and restart. Yosemite may try to recreate it. <comment190788> @IconDaemon Thanks, I'll try this evening when I'm home: moving the file makes a remote login (ARD or SSH) impossible.
