Expand Finder column width with keyboard shortcut <body> I can expand the column width in Finder (OS X El Capitan, MacBook Pro) by clicking on the right-hand line of the column (see red arrow in screenshot). When I click this line, the column width is expanded to the width of the longest file name. How can I do the same with a keyboard shortcut?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/leAmS.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer233192> The answer to this thread pretty much points out the problem with keyboard shortcuts.   Keyboard shortcut (or permanent setting) for fitting column width to longest filename in OS X?
