Cursor movement to beginning/end of line in iOS - possible? <body> Does iOS provide any kind of cursor movement commands.  For example:  ul liYou forward an email or a web page link and you're at the end of the Subject line in the mail app.  You want to jump to the beginning of the Subject line and type something/li liYou enter a set of search terms and then when you see the results, you want to jump to the end of the list and add more/li /ul  I know I can tap but in these cases, the beginning or end of line is off-screen.  <answer198920> Sure you can. On iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 plus in landscape you have  these controls. I have marked with red: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rowBj.png" alt="enter image description here"  But if you want in portrait mode or you have iPhone earlier than 6, do steps:  Long press on text until it appears that magnifying glass and while pressing drag cursor to the beginning of subject and it will move.  This works on landscape and portrait  <comment238262> Thank you.  Interestingly, neither my iPhone 5S nor my iPad Air have those controls, regardless of landscape or portrait.  Both are running iOS 8.4.  I guess this must be a later feature (though it seems lame to me that it's device-specific rather that iOS-version-specific, but that's Apple for you).  I was unaware of the dragging option though, and this works.  Thanks! <comment238265> I think it's pure marketing stuff here. Newer iPhones have brew stuff, even software stuff. And there are lots of differences. Glad I could help you!
