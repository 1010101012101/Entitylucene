How do you build Keynote presentations with a text editor? <body> Is it possible to build complete Keynote presentations with a text editor, including layout specifications, font formatting, etc from scratch?  I'm not trying to get around buying Keynote as I already own it. I'm trying to build a rather long set of slides without the cumbersome part of using the GUI application interface. I'm much more efficient with a text editor.  If this is possible, is there a Keynote spec that details file formats, directory structure, etc? I can't find any documentation regarding this on Apple, yet.  <comment314055> There's some reverse-engineered docs at https://github.com/obriensp/iWorkFileFormat/blob/master/Docs/index.md ... It really does not look amenable to editing by hand.  You might do better with an XML, HTML or LaTeX-based slide package. <comment314140> Not sure how deep down the rabbit hole you want to go, but Keynote has AppleScript support. If you're _really_ motivated, it should be possible to hack together a script to populate a Keynote document from source data. [This site](https://iworkautomation.com/keynote/slide-make.html) has a walkthrough of some of the scripting capabilities of Keynote. (If I were in your shoes I'd use Keyboard Maestro to automate the most painful bits of the GUI operation.) <comment314141> Thank you both for the leads. Gotta figure out how deep I want to go. :)
