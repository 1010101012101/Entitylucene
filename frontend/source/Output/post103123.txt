iPhone 4S iOS 7 Battery Drain <body> I have an iPhone 4S with iOS 7.0.  Since the upgrade, my battery drains twice as fast.  I have applied all the battery saving tips available on the internet (e.g. http://osxdaily.com/2013/09/19/ios-7-battery-life-fix/).  iPhone is primarily used for phone calls, texting, email, documents/scheduling/productivity, and light web surfing.  Anyone experiencing similar issues? Any suggestions or fixes to apply?  Thank you!  <answer112396> I haven't seen that problem with iOS 7.  Have you tried restarting or resetting your iPad?     Restart: Press On/Off button until the Slide to Power Off slider   appears, select Slide to Power Off and, after the iPad shuts down,   then press the On/Off button until the Apple logo appears.      Reset: Press the Home and On/Off buttons at the same time and hold   them until the Apple logo appears (about 10 seconds).   If these don't correct the problem connect to iTunes and do a restore.  strongIf all else fails to do so:/strong  In Settings, turn on Airplane mode, then reset your device by holding Power + Home button 15 seconds until you see the Apple logo. Power back on, then turn off Airplane mode.  <comment126258> I have the same. It will even shut down at around 25%. <comment131966> Hi AppleDevX, my problem was only resolved when I purchased and installed a new battery into my 4S. Now, I can go for 24hrs on a single charge. In the past, the battery barely lasted for 12-15 hrs. <comment132022> How old is your previous 4S battery? <comment132110> My original battery was almost exactly 2 years old.
