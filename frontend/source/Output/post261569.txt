IBooks on iPad: 2-page view for PDF <body> for my studies I am very frequently using iBooks on my iPad, and for many PDF files it would be great to have them displayed, such that 2 pages are shown next to each other. It is a very common thing for me to have to skip back and forth,  so that this would really help.  I have allready seen a few questions akin to this one, however none exactly delivering what i need.  Thanks for your help!
