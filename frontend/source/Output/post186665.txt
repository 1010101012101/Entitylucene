OSX Yosemite 10.10.3 Date added wrong? <body> I download some files. Using Path Finder, it says codeToday/code under the strongDate Added/strong column. code4/5/14/code under strongDate Modified/strong.  I then copy the file off to a external hard disk, but there it shows code4/5/14/code under the strongDate Added/strong and strongDate Modified/strong column.  What is wrong? Shouldn't the codeDate Added/code remain as codeToday/code?  In Finder, the Downloads folder is the same as Path Finder, but for the external hard disk, the strongDate Added/strong column is code--/code.  <comment220427> What format is the external hard drive? <comment220872> @Mark its ExFAT.
