Ethernet (en0) loses IP address when WiFi (en1) starts/stops <body> We're using the Ethernet connection as a point-to-point connection to a lighting console and then the WiFi to connect to the main network. The issue is whenever we turn the WiFi on/off the Ethernet interface, en0, loses its IP and will not work again until its IP is changed.  The Ethernet connection has a fixed IP, whereas the WiFi uses DHCP. The issue is the software we're using with the lighting desk loses connection to the Mac, and it's not practical to keep on changing the IP of en0. Is there anyway of stopping this from occurring? Even if it means throwing together a script that can switch the WiFi instead.  One further question:provided the two networks have different prefixes (10.x.x.x and 192.168.1.x), should the traffic remain on the separate networks, and the applications shouldn't get 'confused', right?  Thanks in advance, and if you need any more information let me know and I'll get what I can.
