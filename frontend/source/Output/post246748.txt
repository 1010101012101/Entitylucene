App (or OSX) changing Accessibility setting by itself <body> Dropbox requests (though doesn't seem to emrequire/em, i.e. it runs without) accessibility/control computer permission (under Security - Privacy).  Removing permission manually (requiring admin password), then rebooting, leads to permission being granted again. Which doesn't seem to be the way it emshould/em be, right?  Any idea what mechanism allows the app to grant itself Accessibility permission? Alternatively, if it's not Dropbox, but OSX itself, why would it change the value?
