Displaying numbers with the right sign <body> I have an odd question: how can I persuade Numbers to show the signs of a series of numbers which may be either positive or negative? The negative sign is a default setting, but there appears to be no default to show the plus sign for positive numbers. It would be useful if it existed, or if some bright spark has a work-around.  <answer249756> At least in older Numbers versions (in my example it's Numbers 3.2.2/Mavericks 10.9.5) you can define a custom data format.  Hit the "Cell" tab and the "Data Format" drop down menu  Create custom Formatâ€¦.  Use the default emNumber/em format and apply an additional rule like in the screenshot below:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uG0Pz.png" alt="enter image description here"  and hit the OK button. Then apply the custom format emNumber+/em to all appropriate fields.  The custom format is document based. You have to configure it anew for every new document.  <comment310160> This works for Numbers 3.x.x as well.
