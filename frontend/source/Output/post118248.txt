How do I remove my network from the recovery partition before sale? <body> I'm about to put my old MBP up for sale, so I re-installed from the recovery partition after wiping the drive. But when I rebooted from the recovery partition to double-check I'd deleted everything, it connected to my wifi network. I've got two questions:  ol liHow do I remove my network credentials from the recovery partition?/li liWhat other personal information is it storing without my knowledge, and how do I wipe it?/li /ol  <answer118441> The answer was indeed to reset the NVRAM by holding cmd-alt-p-r during boot. Cheers :)  <comment138004> Does command+option+p+r during boot erase those settings?  That is how the PRAM is cleared.  You should cycle it until you hear the reboot chime at least two times to be sure.
