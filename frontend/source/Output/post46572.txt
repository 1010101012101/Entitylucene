High resolution drawing app for iPad <body> I'm looking for a good app that I and kids at my home can use to draw pictures on the iPad. I've used many of the free apps, like Chalk Pad and so on, but I notice that each of these comes with a lag.  What's a good app which helps you draw great looking pictures and has a minimum amount of time lag? I'd prefer free apps, though mentioning paid apps won't hurt.  <answer46578> My girlfriend uses iDraw for vector picture drawing. It’s not free, but it’s the best iPad drawing app I’ve seen. It also has an OS X version.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6KK6D.png" alt=""  <answer46590> I like Procreate.  It isn't free, but it's inexpensive and is an excellent drawing package with minimal to no lag, and it does support the new iPad's HD canvas.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MEO34.jpg" alt="enter image description here"
