Sierra "reopen windows" not working <body> Different from many other people, I have a need for finder windows to remain OPEN when I login. I have multiple client folders I need to remember about and keep them visually on my desktop is extremely important. I tried using terminal commands set to TRUE, I tried unchecking, reboot, checking the option right before hitting restart... Nothing is working! Please help!  <comment339861> No one? Please?
