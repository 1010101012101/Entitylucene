How to Prevent iTunes from Downloading Apps Offline? <body> Am I posting on the right discussion board?  I had iTunes starting download something related to "GarageBand" and since it kept increasing in size I had to sign-out and close iTunes. I have located files on my computer:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/luejr.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Why would iTunes download something that is meant for iPad Mini 2 to my computer? How do I disable offline downloading? Thanks.  <comment344545> When you download an app using the app store on your ipad mini, it will be connected to you apple id and downloaded to itunes. When you removed the app you could always reinstall it using itunes when you ipad for example doesn't have an internet connection. I'm not sure if you can turn this future off <comment344550> So that may be Garage Band app that iTunes downloading? It is a few gigabytes and I would not want it on my computer. The iPad was new and when I installed all apps I did not have iTunes downloading them at all until I did something in its settings. I can't recall where to find that option but I must prevent iTunes from downloading content.
