Disabled Iphone 5 <body> My iPhone 5 is disabled because I forgot the passcode. When I tried to connect to iTunes, the computer asked me to reactivate on my iPhone because I changed my computer (I used to use another laptop).  What should I do to reactivate my iPhone?  <answer116720> Apple has some quite extensive documentation on this case here: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1212  Basically you can either strongremote wipe the device if you have Find my iPhone activated/strong or go through the recovery mode:     Disconnect the USB cable from the device, but leave the other end of the cable connected to your computer's USB port.      Turn off the device: Press and hold the Sleep/Wake button for a few seconds until the red slider appears, then slide the slider. Wait for the device to shut down.      While pressing and holding the Home button, reconnect the USB cable to the device. The device should turn on.      Continue holding the Home button until you see the Connect to iTunes screen.      iTunes will alert you that it has detected a device in recovery mode. Click OK, and then restore the device.   Note that on iOS7 if you have Find my iPhone enabled you stronghave to/strong know the AppleID login/password with which the phone is associated otherwise even wiping the phone will not let you activate it again.  <comment142050> This question will have very different answers based on circumstances that are not listed. 1. What OS is on the phone. 2. Do you have a backup of the phone (or even care if it gets wiped). You could start the troubleshooting by listing the exact error message and perhaps what troubleshooting article you are following from http://support.apple.com so that we can avoid asking 20 questions to figure out what step you are on.
