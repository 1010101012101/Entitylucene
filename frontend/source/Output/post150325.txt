Preview.app Signatures - how to unencrypt without old keychain <body> Old mac died. Have a new mac Mac Have all files from old Mac (did a backup before it died). Have been operating with new Mac for several months now.  Needed to use the signatures option in Preview &amp; realized I never transferred them over from the old Mac's backup.  So I read this, Transferring Preview app signatures in Lion, and was able to snag the codecom.apple.Preview.signatures.plist/code file.  But, tho I have the keychain file(s) in the backup, how can I extract just the one I need for this without screwing up my current keychain data?  <answer150355> ol liGo to ~/Library/Keychains on your new Mac and make a copy/backup of your actual codelogin.keychain/code with kbdcmd/kbd kbdD/kbd/li liCopy the old codelogin.keychain/code in /Users/old_user_name/Library/Keychains from the backup to your desktop and rename it to codeloginold.keychain/code/li liOpen codeKeychain Access.app/code and choose File - 'Add Keychain...' in the menu, navigate to your desktop and select codeloginold.keychain/code/li liNow you have a new entry in emKeychains/em named codeloginold/code. Choose codeloginold/code in emKeychains/em and codePasswords/code in emCategory/em  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MZCiv.jpg" alt="screenshot"/li liSelect the object codePreview Signature Privacy/code and drag it to the keychain codelogin/code in emKeychains/em. You will be asked for a password. Enter the password for the old keychain (probably your old user password) and choose codeAlways Allow/code or codeAllow/code. Now the object will be moved to your login keychain./li liChoose codelogin/code in emKeychains/em and codePasswords/code in emCategory/em and check if the new object codePreview Signature Privacy/code is present there./li liIf everything is ok right click codeloginold/code in emKeychains/em and choose codeDelete keychain "loginold"/code. If you choose codeDelete Files and References/code in the following dialog box the keychain codeloginold/code will be deleted from your desktop and in emKeychains/em  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PnNKg.jpg" alt="screenshot2"/li liQuit codeKeychain Access.app/code/li liTest everything with Preview.app/li liIf everything went well go to ~/Library/Keychains and delete the file codelogin copy.keychain/code built for safety reasons in step 1./li liIf something went wrong, you might revert to your previous keychain by deleting codelogin.keychain/code in ~/Library/Keychains and renaming codelogin copy.keychain/code to codelogin.keychain/code. Then i usually log out and in again or restart my Mac to be save./li /ol  Slightly alternative way if the object codePreview Signature Privacy/code is already present in your keychain codelogin/code:br Perform the steps 1-4 from abovebr 5. Locate the codePreview Signature Privacy/code in codeloginold/code in emKeychains/em and codePasswords/code in emCategory/em and double click to edit.br 6. Click the Show password checkbox and enter the old user passwordbr 7. Now the password used to encrypt the signature images is visible. Copy &amp; paste it into a text editor and save the file or paste it directly into the password field of codePreview Signature Privacy/code in your keychain codelogin/code.br strongAny by Preview.app previously signed/protected object on your new Mac might be inaccessible then though./strongbr Continue with the steps 7-11 from above  <comment177062> THANK YOU!!!  never realized the keychain app was that flexible.
