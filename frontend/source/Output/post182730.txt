Do Pages, Numbers and Keynote for Mac/iOS offer real-time collaboration on shared documents like Pages, Numbers and Keynote for iCloud do? <body> In Pages and Numbers (I guess Keynote too) for iCloud if you share a document and then send the link to other people you get real-time collaboration between the contributors as they edit the document and you can see the edits taking place live.  Does this work on Pages and Numbers for Mac/iOS?  <comment313574> Your wait is over - coming in Sierra/iOS 10 :) <comment313592> True but I don't think it will be a Sierra/iOS10 exclusive, just a new iWork for mac and ios. http://www.apple.com/apple-events/september-2016/   19min:45sec
