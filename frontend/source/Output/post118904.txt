What is the source directory? <body> In the website http://gfs.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Mac_OSX_Installation   In this line:       type from the source directory  precode./autogen.sh ./configure --enable-osmesa --prefix=$HOME/soft make make install /code/pre   What is the source directory referring to here ?  <answer118911> strongIt's the directory that contains the source./strong In the example given in the link, it's code~/soft/code, but it really depends where you unpacked the tarball containing the source.  code./autogen.sh/code runs autogen.sh in the current folder. However, autogen.sh and the source files won't be in every folder. It's asking you do go to the folder that contains the app source to run the commands. codecd &lt;path&gt;/code to go there, then run the commands.  <comment138690> thank u so much
