Disabling desktop switching animation on El Capitan <body> On Yosemite I used totalspaces to modify this behaviour as well as having a grid layout... I understand that totalspaces no longer works without doing some system modifications.  The animation I wish to eliminate/speed up is the default space switching animation, which for me is invoked by either swiping left/right with three fingers or ctrl+ left/right.  Is it possible to kill or speed this up?  Edit: One year later, we're on Sierra now.... please send help  <answer225352> Try pasting this into Terminal.app:  codedefaults write com.apple.dock expose-animation-duration -float 0.1/code  It is supposed to     Make all animations faster that are used by Mission Control.

How do you switch desktops? what hardware is in play? <comment257987> I think I know, I have the same problem. The animation in question is when the entire current screen slides away to the left or right, and another desktop slides in. This can be achieved by swiping with three fingers on the trackpad sideways, or [Ctrl]+[RightArrow/LeftArrow]. It's really annoying, because if you fullscreen a text editor, and quickly want to [Cmd]+[Tab] to a browser and reload it, you have to wait for the animation to finish, otherwise the key presses goes to the editor, not the browser. <comment258021> Yes this is it exactly!! Super annoying for switching between desktops often. <comment274141> Unfortunately this isn't quite right - It just enables the mission control commands (like showing all open windows), but not the desktop switching animation.
