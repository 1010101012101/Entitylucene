How to find out which files currently in my iPod would be deleted or modified if I synchronize it? <body> The brief version of my question is pretty much what the title says:     How can I safely determine which of the files currently in my iPod would be deleted or modified if I synchronized it in iTunes?   (The term "modified" is admittedly a bit fuzzy.  If more precision is needed, I'll define "modified" to mean that the old and new versions are not "equal", where files A and B are defined to be "equal" if codediff A B/code produces no output to the terminal.)  (Of course, simply synchronizing the iPod and then "looking for what's missing or changed" is strongemnot/em/strong an acceptable answer.  If you need more details, please read on.)  hr  As I explained in another post, as part of a troubleshooting effort, I would like to enable synchronization for my iPod, in iTunes.  Unfortunately, I am almost certain that synchronizing this iPod with my current iTunes library would result in the modification or outright deletion of emmany/em files from my iPod.  The obvious solution of backing up the entire iPod, and restoring it later, is not an option, simply because at the moment I do not have a sufficiently convenient 150GB of disk space that I could use for this.  (In fact, the problem that motivates this post arose as I was trying to make some room in my hard drive.)  But I emmay/em have enough room to back up the subset of those files now in my iPod that emwould be deleted or modified/em upon synchronization.  Hence the question posed at the beginning of this post.  <comment79324> Why would any files be removed to begin with? iTunes shouldn't *remove* anything unless you've set the iPod to let iTunes manage the music/apps/photos/etc automatically.
