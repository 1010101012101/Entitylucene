Stop iCloud automatic download to harddrive <body> How do I stop iCloud from downloading files to my hard drive? I opened up a folder and it immediately started downloading all contents  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qGh9H.png" alt="Clicking on the X deos not work"  <answer268907> No it is not possible to stop automatic downloads or delay it.  iCloud is not a backup system, it is a syncing system, so it downloads whatever data is stored there to each computer and device signed in with the same Apple ID. There is no way to selectively download. It is an all or nothing sync. Apple have shown no interest so far in 'online backup' as you describe it, don't rely on that changing anytime soon.  When your storage on your device is almost full, the system will purge data that you do not use often. It will still be stored inside iCloud.  <answer269171> This answer is incorrect.
