packet forwarding on OSX mavericks <body> My MacBookAir(Mavericks 10.9.2) need to share my internet connection(wi-fi;en0) with BeagleBoneBlack(BBB) which are in 192.168.7.0 subnet over en6 interface.  ifconfig  precode$ ifconfig lo0: flags=8049&lt;UP,LOOPBACK,RUNNING,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 16384     options=3&lt;RXCSUM,TXCSUM&gt;     inet6 ::1 prefixlen 128      inet 127.0.0.1 netmask 0xff000000      inet6 fe80::1%lo0 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x1      nd6 options=1&lt;PERFORMNUD&gt; gif0: flags=8010&lt;POINTOPOINT,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1280 stf0: flags=0&lt;&gt; mtu 1280 en0: flags=8863&lt;UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500     ether 7c:d1:c3:ee:f3:dd      inet6 fe80::7ed1:c3ff:feee:f3dd%en0 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x4      inet 192.168.2.35 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.2.255     nd6 options=1&lt;PERFORMNUD&gt;     media: autoselect     status: active en5: flags=8963&lt;UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,PROMISC,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500     options=60&lt;TSO4,TSO6&gt;     ether 32:00:18:d5:b1:40      media: autoselect &lt;full-duplex&gt;     status: inactive en6: flags=863&lt;UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX&gt; mtu 1486     ether 90:59:af:58:5e:96      inet 192.168.7.1 netmask 0xfffffffc broadcast 192.168.7.3     media: autoselect     status: active bridge0: flags=8863&lt;UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500     options=63&lt;RXCSUM,TXCSUM,TSO4,TSO6&gt;     ether 7e:d1:c3:ee:e2:00      Configuration:         id 0:0:0:0:0:0 priority 0 hellotime 0 fwddelay 0         maxage 0 holdcnt 0 proto stp maxaddr 100 timeout 1200         root id 0:0:0:0:0:0 priority 0 ifcost 0 port 0         ipfilter disabled flags 0x2     member: en5 flags=3&lt;LEARNING,DISCOVER&gt;             ifmaxaddr 0 port 5 priority 0 path cost 0     nd6 options=1&lt;PERFORMNUD&gt;     media: &lt;unknown type&gt;     status: inactive p2p0: flags=8843&lt;UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 2304     ether 0e:d1:c3:ee:f3:dd      media: autoselect     status: inactive /code/pre  Here are my internet sharing settings img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-39qOizCWqW8/U3nDAU1MC1I/AAAAAAAABHU/w7G4i--Phhg/w667-h545-no/Screen+Shot+2014-05-19+at+2.07.11+pm.png" alt="internet sharing settings" title="internet sharing settings" I'm unable to ping 8.8.8.8 from BBB though I shared wi-fi with BeagleBoneBlack. Whether I share internet connection or not codeipfw/code gives same result  precode$ sudo ipfw list 65535 allow ip from any to any /code/pre  I tried disabling firewall in vain. I could share my internet connection from Ubuntu machine through iptables. Here I need to masquerade packets through gateway interface.  Should I have configure anything like NAT on the bridge between en0(internet access) and en6?  <answer131513> The Internet Sharing service will handle all the translation requirements by itself. For some reason, though, it's necessary to use the Network Preferences pane to manually confirm the information the bridging interface has already come up with on its own. (Since the BBB has its own DHCP server, perhaps the Mac is willing to accept the BBB's DHCP offer in the 192.168.7.x subnet as a suggestion, but then reinforces the fact that as the DNS it holds the keys to the external world, thereby imposing its configuration on the communication process. I don't know. I do digress, however.)   After turning on Internet Sharing for the BBB in the Sharing pane, switch to the Network pane of System Preferences. Select the en6 service in the lefthand window, click "Advanced" at the lower right, and select the "TCP/IP" pane. If it's not already filled in, Under "Configure IPv4," select "Manually" from the drop-down menu, enter 192.168.7.1 for both the IPv4 and router addresses and 255.255.255.252 as the subnet mask. This leaves 192.168.7.2 for the BBB and 192.168.7.3 as the broadcast address. You can ignore the IPv6 configuration section. Next, select the "DNS" pane from the top row of tabs. Click on the '+' mark just below the window and add 192.168.7.1. In the right hand window, add "local" (without the quote marks) to the search domains.  FYI, I'm sure you'll want to know that ipfw has been deprecated and replaced by pfctl in OS 10.9.   <comment154133> is there a reason you showing the Internet sharing OFF <comment154134> I want to share internet connection only with `BeagleBoneBlack` . Anyway I tried enabling sharing with all interfaces. <comment154135> @Buscar notice Internet sharing off is greyed out <comment154137> sorry my mistake...the inet showing (ifconfig) and the inet you wrote down do not match for en6 <comment154138> en6 ipv4 address is 192.168.7.1 and is in 192.168.7.0 subnet r8? <comment154140> so why is the mtu set to the odd number 1486? did you do that ? <comment154142> no i didn't do that. Frankly I don't know what MTU is. I'll b grateful if u explain. thank you. <comment154144> I got what MTU is Maximum Transmission Unit. Large is preferrable for High speed or long distant communication. Mars Explorer would have got largest MTU. <comment154145> ok, you type faster then me :( since it is set to not standard, I would change it back to 1500 standard just for heck of it. <comment154158> @Buscar I tried to change MTU but it didn't. I deleted the BeagleBoneBlack connection and its gone. I tried reinstalling driver but the connection didn't install as before. It has become a dialup connection and don't work. Now I have to beg on internet how to reinstall BBB drivers on Mac! <comment154162> sorry to hear sounds like the drivers?, did you try using USB cable as connection MAC-BBB? or using Ethernet cable? <comment154163> I use USB cable to MAC-BBB. In the connection type there is no USB connection. <comment154164> let us [continue this discussion in chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/14601/discussion-between-buscar-and-necktwi)
