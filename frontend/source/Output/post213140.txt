App Store on iOS 9.1 using large amounts of battery <body> Under Settings iTunes &amp; App Stores I have all of the Automatic Downloads flags switched to off, however when I look under the Battery section in Settings, App Store (background activity) is #1 on the list with 7.3 hours in the background. Is anyone else seeing this? Is there another setting somewhere to disable other than the iTunes &amp; App Store screen?  <comment257583> I've the same trouble from iOS 9.1 but, in my case, App Store hasn't big battery consumption in  battery menu...
