How can I restore the default dimensions of the Force Quit dialog <body> I accidentally maximized the Force Quit dialoge on my Mac and I am looking for a way to restore it to its original size other than manually resizing it. I would like it to be have exact dimensions as before.  Is there such a way to do that, for example, with preference files or codedefaults/code?  <answer95138> You can delete a key in ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow.plist:  precodedefaults delete com.apple.loginwindow 'NSWindow Frame ProcessPanel' /code/pre  The changes seem to be applied immediately.  <answer270919> simply double click on the taskbar. that will do the trick :)  <comment111517> If you tell us how did you minimze it in first place ?
