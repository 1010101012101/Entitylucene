Remap keys to match Windows, but CMD+Tab for switching app? <body> I have been using Karabiner and Better Touch Tool to remap my keys, so they match like Windows. Since I'm used to that layout, I wanted it switched. However, since I updated to Sierra, Karabiner no longer works, and I have to use Karabiner Elements, which just can't do multiple keys. So what I have now in Karabiner Elements is:  precodeleft_command -&gt; left_option fn -&gt; left command left_option -&gt; left_control left_control -&gt; fn /code/pre  This allows me to do stuff like kbdFn/kbd kbdT/kbd for opening a new tab and so on. However, I want to open the Application Switcher (basically kbdCommand/kbdkbdTab/kbd) using kbdCommand/kbdkbdTab/kbd on the keyboard. In Karabiner I could make a "pass-through", which allowed me to ignore those keys:   img src="https://i.imgur.com/buSZaPc.png" /  What would the best way be, to satisfy my needs?   <comment319793> This is the problem with immediately upgrading to a new version of an OS - your stuff that works suddenly doesn't.  According to the folks at Karabiner - it's not compatible with Sierra, but they are working on it.   Aside from finding a whole new solution, I would wait for Karabiner to be compatible with Sierra. <comment319798> @Allan Uhm, sure. Karabiner won't be compatible with Sierra. The creator made Karabiner Elements, so he's probably going to disgard Karabiner. <comment319800> From the [webpage](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/):  "We'll start updating for the full featured Karabiner for Sierra after Karabiner-Elements is completed."  It's highlighted in the big red box. <comment319803> @Allan Oh, that's not what I read on the other sites though. Oh well :-)
