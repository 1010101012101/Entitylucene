Open Terminal.app but hold open? <body> I have a shell script that runs on my mac (code./go/code), it opens a ssh session on a raspberry pi then runs a script which streams video from the raspberry pi to a UDP port on the mac.  I also need the mac to run a receive script (code./tsplay/code) so it can view the streamed video.  The problem is that I have tried to use the command codeopen -a Terminal.app ./tsplay/code before the SSH session is started, a new terminal window opens but it doesn't wait for stream data to come in and it exits  - [Process completed]  precode#!/bin/bash  source network.conf  rm remote.conf  if [ "$1" != "" ]  then   sed "s/FRAMERATE=25/FRAMERATE=$1/" video.conf &gt; remote.conf else   cp video.conf remote.conf fi  open -a Terminal.app ./tsplay   date echo "###### Network Settings ######" &gt;&gt; remote.conf echo export TCPPORT=$TCPPORT &gt;&gt; remote.conf echo export UDPPORT=$UDPPORT &gt;&gt; remote.conf echo export RX_IP=$RX_IP &gt;&gt; remote.conf echo export NOW=\"`date +%F" "%T`\" &gt;&gt; remote.conf  #echo exit &gt;&gt; remote.conf  chmod +x remote.conf  echo Copy script to $TX_IP scp remote.conf $USER@$TX_IP:/home/pi  echo Run Script ssh $USER@$TX_IP ./ustream ssh $USER@$TX_IP /code/pre  <answer171770> Why do you want to run codetsplay/code in a Terminal anyway?  Surely it is a graphical app if it displays video? Why not do a sleep for a while to let the Pi start sending and then start codetsplay/code to receive?  precodefi ... (sleep 5; ./tsplay ) &amp; ... date /code/pre  <comment202230> Thanks for the reply. The ./go script finishes with ssh $USER@$TX_IP ./ustream   .  that starts the video sending pipeline which needs to stay open while streaming, as does the ./tsplay which i also need to open at the same time (or a few seconds after)
