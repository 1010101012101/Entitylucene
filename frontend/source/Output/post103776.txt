How to install WhatsApp on an iPad 4 without 3G? <body> I own an iPad 4 without 3G (functioning only Wi-Fi) running iOS 7. How can I install WhatsApp on this iPad?  <answer103777> From the FAQ on whatsapp.com:     Other devices are not supported at this time. If you try to download WhatsApp on an unsupported device, you will receive a message that your device is not supported and you will not be able to download WhatsApp. strongWe currently do not support tablets, computers, or Wi-Fi only devices/strong, and do not plan to do so in the foreseeable future.   <answer103783> I've run Whatsapp on a jailbroken iPad. But apparently it is also possible on a non-jailbroken iPad.  You will need a mobile phone to receive the first authentication text-message and the free application iFunBox to put the IPA file on the iPad. Instructions can be found at Redmond Pie.
