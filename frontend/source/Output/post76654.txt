Network Volumes changing preferred settings for viewing <body> Our network volume does this really irritating thing where it remembers the settings for the last person who viewed the folder. The view options etc. change if someone else accesses the file.  I know this information is stored in codeDS_Store/code and there's a command to stop creation of codeDS_Store/code - the problem is, codeDS_Store/code also stores labels/colours for each of the files in Finder, something that we need to retain.  Is there a way for us to work this out?br The constant view switching is really annoying - one folder opens in Icons view, the next in list view, the next with column view, all with different arrange fields - I just want each user's particular preference to be honoured for just them.
