What causes all iWork apps to have blank, unusable documents after a reinstall? <body> After deleting and re-installing the apps, I can't use iWork. Specifically, the document area is always empty, no matter if I create a new document or open an existing one. This applies to Pages, Numbers and Keynotes.  I can guess there's something in the document, because the mouse pointer changes when I move it over the empty area. So it seems like a display error. What can I do to resolve this?  <answer11740> Check if you have the font colour set to white.  <answer58124> I had a little trouble getting iWork '09 to work correctly on Mountain Lion.  When I tried to create a new document from template chooser, it was blank, and I could not do anything.  When I tried to open an existing file, it said it "file  could not be opened".  This applied for Numbers, Pages, and Keynote.  This is how I solved it,  ol liMoved the iWork Folder in Applications to Trash./li liRemoved code/Library/Application Support/iWork '09/code/li liRe-Installed iWork (I had installation Media)./li liThen installed the Mountain Lion iWork updates./li /ol  Hope that works for you.  <answer188018> I have the same problem. If I open an existing or new iWork version 9.0.3 Pages document under OS X 10.7.2 only a blank document is visible. Anything entered remains invisible.  I find however that if I restart the iMac at this point, a Pages document opens properly - that is, it now becomes visible.  <answer229161> Install this update: Pages 08 3.0.3  <comment12299> Yes, the problem occurs in all three programs, using different documents etc. The documents open fine in other programs (e.g. Microsoft Word or Excel). <comment23100> What do you exactly mean by empty, can you elaborate a little pls <comment91604> What's your source? Mac App Store or disks? <comment91669> It was from a CD. <comment279507> Can you explain why this fixes the issue? A little more context as to exactly what's happening would be nice.
