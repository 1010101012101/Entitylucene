How to stop taskgated on Sierra? <body> When I just codesudo pkill/code it:  precodesudo pkill taskgated /code/pre  In syslog:  precodeApr 17 12:08:46 genesis com.apple.xpc.launchd[1] (com.apple.taskgated[88619]) &lt;Notice&gt;: Service exited due to signal: Terminated: 15 sent by pkill[90814] /code/pre  However it automatically restarts:  precodeps aux | grep taskgated root             90981   0.0  0.0  2462316   1668   ??  Ss   12:08PM   0:00.01 /usr/libexec/taskgated -s /code/pre  Also note, that using codelaunchctl/code is also not the way to do it:  precodesudo launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.taskgated*.plist /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.taskgated-helper.plist: Operation not permitted while System Integrity Protection is engaged /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.taskgated.plist: Operation not permitted while System Integrity Protection is engaged /code/pre  <answer281007> This process cannot be forcefully killed because the another process automatically reopens it. Try killing it non-forcefully.  <answer281010> Launchd is keeping the process alive. You need to run  precode$ sudo launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.taskgated*.plist /code/pre  to unload the daemon. To load it again, run:  precode$ sudo launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.taskgated*.plist /code/pre  <comment353544> Not on Sierra. This is a protected process. I've updated my question to reflect that. <comment353554> Sorry, I forget that I have SIP disabled sometimes. I guess there's no way to do it without disabling SIP, after all, `taskgated` is designed by for security.
