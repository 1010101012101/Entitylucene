How can i change and customize the special characters on my keyboard? <body> This is my first post at AskDifferent, hopefully it works out.  emMy problem:/em  ul lii want to insert the symbol "λ" aka 'lamda' everytime i use the Option-L key. However, by default my OS Mountain Lion inserts "¬"./li /ul  emMy question:/em  ul liHow can i change this empermanently/em and emfor every application i open/em (i.e. any browser, MS Word, Finder, etc…). I've never used "¬" but as an engineering student i very often require "λ."/li /ul  This post was very informative and in depth:  How can I expand the number of special characters I can type using my keyboard?  However i have no desire to change my overall layout – only a couple keys. It didn't really address the simple question i have.  Is there a way to do this emwithout/em creating a new keyboard layout? Can i not simply change a single special character from "¬" to "λ" ? I am currently looking at the "Ukelele" application but i don't want to be creating all sorts of new stuff.  Thank You.  <answer90012>    Is there a way to do this without creating a new keyboard layout?    You can do it by defining emService/em:  ol liRun emAutomator/em/li liChoose a type for your document: emService/em/li liCheck codeText/code from codeLibrary/code on the left/li liDouble click codeGet Specified Text/code/li liOn the right check codeOutput replaces selected text/code/li liPaste your character into text editor window of "Get Specified Text"/li liRun codeSystem Preferences/code and choose codeKeyboard -&gt; Keyboard Shortcuts/code/li liChoose codeServices/code/li liFind your brand new service and assign it a shortcut/li /ol  Or with key bindings.  <answer90014> You might want to try just defining ¬ as λ in system prefs/language &amp; text/text/symbol and text substitutions.  Normally you need to type a space or another character to get the switch, and there may be some apps it does not work in (Pages and Word have their own symbol and text substitution settings).  <answer90028> You can create code~/Library/KeyBindings//code and save a property list like this as DefaultKeyBinding.dict:  precode{     "~l" = (insertText:, "λ"); } /code/pre  After reopening applications, ⌥L should insert λ in most text views. It doesn't work in for example Terminal or Xcode though.
