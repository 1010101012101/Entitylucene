(a single ellipses character: "…" vs. three periods: "..."  I didn't test the whole script, but this change brought the menu item up in Safari for me via AppleScript.  <comment263790> I'm far from being an expert on this, but I'm pretty sure you need to be looking at AXMenuItems to be able to accurately hit a specific menu command by Applescript, as I did in this Answer - http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/209219/85275 - More good luck than good management got me there, but it might be useful to you. <comment263793> Will that be applicable since this is not a Check/Uncheck option? <comment263800> That, I'm not absolutely certain on - but I think you need that structure to find the menu option in the first place. The long list of "of menu "x" of menu item 1 of …" etc seems crucial, though - & it's one part I really do not fully comprehend as to how it is structured. My Googling took me far & wide whilst trying to work out that answer. <comment263805> Just to clarify: You want to click `Clear History` and `Empty Caches` right? <comment263808> Yes, correct. I am basically wanting to reset safari. Which is emptying cache and clearing history
