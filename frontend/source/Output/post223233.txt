Permission denied to create tree directory - El Capitan <body> Following this tutorial , under the subtitle      Download angular-phonecat   Since there is a local server comes packages with El Capitan, and I have an ios emulator installed to run some web app while developing, my best "guess" is that I need to place my WebApp projects where the server limits me to  While running as a user, I need to git clone a dir tree in a folder which belongs to the admin.  As requested by a commenter to show the full path of the destination folder:    The destination folder where the tree will be copied to is:br Macintosh HD/Library/WebServer/Documents/  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/H1C6Q.png" alt="enter image description here"  In the terminal, If the destination folder gives rwx to the admin then why "permission denied" is returned?  I don't want to add the user to the sodoers file and do not want to logout and login as an admin as the command I copied form a web page unto the clipboard will be lost.

Why not just in your name clone to a directory in your own home directory.  Noting your comment re beginners we need to know more as to experienced users this looks like you are doing something totally wrong i.e. explain the process you need to be doing from the start.  <comment270620> whoever down voted it, care to comment why or what improvement could be made to this question for beginners in OSX to learn? <comment270622> What is the full path of the directory you are trying to write to? <comment270635> Where does the tutorial say this needs to be in a directory not in your home directory and not as you? <comment270639> The destination is chosen by me since that is where the local web server is, so that in the browser url I can type "http://localhost:63342/project folder/index.html" and expect it to work. <comment270645> My last comments was meant to open the index.html not in the browser but in a ios emulator for web app development.
