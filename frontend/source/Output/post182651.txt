Original Apple clock information <body> I've been doing a clean out and I found an original Apple clock. It's over 13 years old at least and is in mint condition in a metal apple box.   I can't find it anywhere on the internet, could anyone tell me how much it is worth or more about the product? (Is it rare or limited edition?)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CTLJp.jpg" alt=""  <answer182653> It was a Marketing campaign by Apple in 2003, giving it for strongfree/strong for Test Drive of they Power Mac G5 called Test Drive (G5TestDrive.ca), a limited edition Apple-branded stopwatch.     Apple has sent at least some of its apple canada customers a special   promotion postcards in the mail.the promotion offers a g5 test drive   (g5testdrive.ca) along with a limited edition apple-branded stopwatch   (photo) as well as an entry to win a new 1.8ghz g5 powermac and a   20inch apple cinema display.for a limited time, apple is also offering   invitees a $200 discount on a g5/display/applecare bundle.again, the   offer is only open to direct-mail postcard recipients.   http://www.macrumors.com/mac/?sid=20040317155502  <comment217553> Is there any type of product information on the item itself or box you can include in your question?  Also why couldn't you include a better picture of the item and its box, showing it all not a cropped oversize image?
