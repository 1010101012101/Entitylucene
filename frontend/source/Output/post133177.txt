How can I get Final Cut Pro to reload my Motion projects without restarting it? <body> I often switch back and forth between working on a Final Cut project and working on a Motion generator or title I use in that project. If I make changes to the Motion project, I have to restart Final Cut to see those changes reflected in the instances of the generator or title already in the timeline.  Is there a way to get Final Cut to reload the Motion files without restarting it?
