Does Apple review apps while WWDC? <body> 3 days ago I submitted app for review, and it still waits for apple's review. Now there is a WWDC in Cupertino. Is it mean that Apple stopped reviewing apps while conference?  <answer285954> App Store reviews are continuing during WWDC.  According to Average App Store Review Times, reviews are continuing during WWDC. The raw data page shows reviews completed during the last 24 hours, such as Stuart Cooper‚Äè's tweet.  <comment360744> No, they still review apps, I've an app rejected 30 min before the WWDC keynote started.
