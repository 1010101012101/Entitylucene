How to differentiate between applications with the same name in applescripts <body> I'm trying to use codetell application "Google Chrome"/code in order to script the OS X Chrome app, but this keeps being interpreted as referring to a virtual application with the same name which refers to the windows "Google Chrome" inside a parallels desktop virtual machine. (Parallels Desktop automatically creates dummy OS X applications corresponding to all of the windows programs, so that they can appear running in the OS X dock etc.)  How could I differentiate between applications of the same name in such codetell/code statements, based on the application path or some other attribute?  <answer158857> When you type codetell application "whatever"/code and you click compile, if codewhatever/code does not exists, it will appear a window that let you choose the application. Try this way.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z7LVi.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer158864> You can use direct path to the application inside Your Apple Script. This will looke like:  precodeset p to "/Applications/Safari.app" tell application p to activate /code/pre  Here's the link about AppleScript and POSIX paths
