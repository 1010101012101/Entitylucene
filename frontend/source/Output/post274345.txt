How to import edited (cropped/filtered) photos from iPhone to Mac? <body> ul liI take photos with my iPhone SE running iOS 10.2.1. /li liI edit the photos in the native Photos app (cropping and filtering). /li liI sync to my MacBook Pro running OS X 10.11.6 (El Capitan) using the native Photos app via USB. /li liOnly original versions of the photos appear in Mac Photos. Where are the edited versions? They still appear as edited-only in iOS Photos. /li /ul  My workaround is to view each photo individually and upload to Dropbox, then download to my Mac and import into Mac Photos, but this is extremely tedious.   Is there a better workaround, or even an actual solution?   <answer274346> Apple has a support page about this.     h2Most programs will show the original, unedited version of the image./h2      Images you import to your computer directly from your iOS device will show up as the original image in iPhoto, Aperture, and in the Finder.   h1To import edited photos to your computer/h1  If you want to view the edited version of a photo on a Mac or PC that doesnâ€™t automatically import the edited version:  ol licodeAirDrop/code or email the photo to yourself./li liOr, if you've enabled strongiCloud Photo Library/strong, download it from the Photos web app at iCloud.com. /li /ol  This will save a copy of the edited version on your computer, but you won't be able to revert to the original, unedited version.  <comment344926> I'm using Photos app, not iPhoto app. <comment344947> It shouldn't matter, the steps are the same. Have you tried these steps?  Did it work?  If not, what errors are you seeing? <comment344970> Photos *should* import the edits too. (Just clarifying in case you or @fsb think this is expected behaviour.) <comment345029> I expect that the Photos app native to OS X should import any edits I make in the Photos app native to iOS (why wouldn't anyone expect this, what would be the point of allowing editing if the changes aren't saved?). <comment345032> Transferring photos individually via AirDrop, email, Dropbox, etc, preserves the edits. But this is impractical for dozens of photos per month. <comment345035> Enabling iCloud Photo Library would "automatically upload and store your entire library in iCloud to access photos and videos from all your devices". iCloud syncing many thousands of photos taken across a lifetime isn't practical for simply importing recent photos from one device to another with edits preserved. <comment345039> Yup, it works great for me, it imports the edits non- destructively so I can get the original image back or modify certain aspects of the edit. Sorry I can't be more help, no idea why it's not working like that for you. I don't use iCloud Photo Library. <comment345045> Regardless of whether or not you believe it's practical, this is the way the Apple set it up.
