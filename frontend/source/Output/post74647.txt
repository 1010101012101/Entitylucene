Double clicking the title bar of iTunes 11 does not minimize the window <body> With Mac applications I can double click on the title bar of the application and then it will minimize. iTunes 11 lost this behaviour.  Is there a way to restore it?  I'm on OSX 10.6.8 and using iTunes 11.0  <answer74684> This has been an annoying feature of iTunes 11. Other internet forums here and here, are already discussing the issue and as yet are without a solution. Imagine it's something that needs to be implemented by apple.  <answer102481> Leave the mouse in the top right corner of the iTunes frame, your file bar should drop down with a little blue indicator showing two caddie cornered arrows pointing into each each other.  If this won't work, unplug your mini-display port, three finger slide left to access maximized docks and try it again.  <comment120654> The two arrows don't minimise iTunes, they take the app out of fullscreen mode. What do you mean by `access maximized docks`?
