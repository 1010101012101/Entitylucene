Macbook freezes (keyboard, mouse, audio not working) with external hard drive <body> I've installed some apps on external hard drive, as I don't have enough space on my macbook's drive. Sadly macbook behaves really weirdly few times a day.br Basically it freezes completely (although youtube video is still playing if it happens) and I cannot do anything - mouse, keyboard, touchpad are not working and I only can turn it of by pressing power button for a longer time.br I think it happens only when something runs from that external drive.br My macbook info:br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HkeVt.png" alt="enter image description here"  External drive info:br codeSamsung 1TB M3 Portable 2,5''/codebr It uses NTFS  but I used Samsung's codeNTFS_for_Mac_11.3/code software to have read/write permissions.br Console logs:    precodeMar  2 14:57:23 Piotrs-MacBook-Pro.local com.apple.AmbientDisplayAgent[215]: AMBD Agent: xpc connection became invalid during event handler Mar  2 14:57:23 Piotrs-MacBook-Pro kernel[0]: IPv6 packet filtering initialized, default to accept, logging disabled Mar  2 14:57:23 Piotrs-MacBook-Pro kernel[0]: AirPort: Link Down on en0.

An inexpensive test is to use another cable that you know works on other disks. If the disk mounts and does not crash your Macbook, then the old cable is suspect. You should probably recycle it.  <comment279990> Does this drive _need_ to be formatted with NTFS? You don't mention if you share this drive with any Windows-based CPUs. If this drive connects to Windows, then edit your question (or comment) to that effect. If this drive is only used on this (and other Mac OS X systems) then reformat with Disk Utility using Mac OS X Journaled. <comment279994> It's not used on Windows. But why/how OSX Journaled format will fix my issue? <comment280009> Formatting Journaled is the standard disk formatting method for OS X and was not mentioned as a solution to the issue: not using NTFS _will_ fix the issue. If you don't need NTFS at all, don't use it! <comment280046> Yeah... I meant using Journaled format INSTEAD of NTFS... So is it something which looks like poor support for NTFS on OSXs related issue? <comment280054> [Apple does include limited NTFS support](http://www.techrepublic.com/article/pro-tip-enable-ntfs-write-support-natively-for-os-x/), but most NTFS disks need 3rd party software to work more reliably than Apple's drivers. Some NTFS implementations are better than others, but if you'll never need to connect this drive to a Windows machine, you're better off with the native OS X format. You didn't mention what kind of interface this drive hangs from. USB? FireWire 400/800? Thunderbolt? <comment280661> It's USB. I reformatted it to Mac OS X Journaled and I still see that macbook freezes <comment280786> It is probably a hardware issue then. Are the same errors showing up in the log-files? What are you doing with the drive that causes it to freeze the Mac? Just plugging it in? Reading/Writing files? Opening apps? <comment280787> Do you mean issue is on macbook or external drive side? It happened only once since reformat and I don't see it in logs, but will check it next time. So it mostly happens during write operations, e.g. one of the apps installed on that drive creates some new files or I am downloading something on it <comment280807> Does this drive fail no matter which USB port you use on the MPB? The only way to test is to get (or borrow) a known-working external USB drive, or test this misbehaving drive on somebody else's Mac. <comment280982> It fails on every USB port. I have used different drive before and I haven't noticed that issue <comment281078> Sounds like the drive, the electronics, or both, are not working correctly. If the drive has a detachable USB cable, remove it and experiment with a known-good USB cable. It's the last thing you can try before opening up the case and removing the HD. <comment281960> @IconDaemon I've replaced original dual-female USB cable with different single one and I don't see freezing any more... Really weird. <comment281983> Ah. Usually a dual USB cable is to provide additional power to the drive which requires more current than can be provided from a single USB port. Looking at the specs for this drive, I see that it is a USB3 device. Is this an earlier model with USB2? <comment282012> It's USB3 but somehow working. Should I buy new dual cable or can I use this one? <comment282023> If this cable is working then use it! <comment282037> Thanks. You can post an answer about checking USB cable and I can accept it and give you points!
