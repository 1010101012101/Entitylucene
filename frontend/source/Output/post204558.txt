continue playlist after re-opening iTunes <body> After quitting and re-opening iTunes (iTunes 12, German language) the playlist does not proceed where I left off before I quit. However, the codelast added/code (German: Zuletzt hinzugef√ºgt) queue or, if not displayed, the very first artist is played (songs sorted by artist).  Googling lead to some older posts from the year 2010 and showed some "solutions" using Apple-Script Bookmark features, but there should have been some further development in iTunes the last five years...  So, is there a natively implemented way to continue the playlist at the point where I left off last time? If not, how could I achieve this by using external (Mac OS) features?
