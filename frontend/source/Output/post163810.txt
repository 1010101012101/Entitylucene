How do I add it back? <body> My menu bar looks like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/b8mJb.png" alt="enter image description here"  As you can see the battery icon is missing because I accidentally removed it by CMD+Click+Dragging it off of the menu bar. Also, the customize toolbar button is not clickable.  <answer163815> You can find the battery.menu among others in the  /System/Library/CoreServices/Menu Extras  double click on it to get it back in the menu bar.  <answer163821> The simple way, goto "System preferences" - "Energy Saver", and check "Show Battery status in menu bar"  <answer235083> Go to system preferences and click on energy saver. There, you check the unchecked "Show battery status in menu bar". Your battery should appear.  <comment191838> Actually, you dragged it off the menu bar. The toolbar is the area at the top of a Finder window, just below the title. That's why customizing the toolbar won't put it back. <comment287491> Hi Hazel and welcome to Ask Different.
