Not getting to boot! <body> Last week I upgraded my MacBook Pro 13" mid 2012 RAM to 8 GB and I had random restarts. So I did a safe boot and everything was fine, two days later the same thing happened again and the  again it was resolved on safe boot.   It happened again today after about 4 or 5 days and I had installed el Capitan beta yesterday on a 30 GB partion.br So today after this random restart problem. I started my Mac and pressed the option key and held it. Then selected my main hard disk to startup and then immediately after selection, I held the shift key so it would safe boot.br It booted just a bit more than half and hung and switched off.br I tried to go into recovery mode, but it booted to el Capitan recovery mode and the disk utility was not working.br If I try boot normally. It restarts 5 minutes after boot.    What should I do?br Is there any way I could change the startup disk without booting so I can  boot into main hard disk recovery mode disk utility and maybe repair the disk or can someone help me troubleshoot?  <answer193537> You should see if Apple Diagnostics finds anything wrong with your RAM. Turn off your computer, disconnect any external peripherals you have, press the power button to turn your computer on, and immediately hold down D until Apple Diagnostics begins.  <answer199966> I would connect that Mac to another running back and copy any files that are not backed up. Then I would then erase the hard drive/ partition and reinstall whatever operating system I wanted to run on it.  <comment230707> I tried it and it found nothing unusual <comment230708> In that case, you could try taking out the RAM and putting it back in. I know from [experience](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/179024/85884) that sometimes misbehaving RAM just needs to be moved around. <comment230709> OK, will try that <comment230710> Is there any other way than that <comment230711> Unable to run hardware test also <comment230712> It is going to internet recovery when I hold D
