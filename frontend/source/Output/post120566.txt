How can I set a shortcut to close the window of TotalTerminal <body> TotalTerminal is great. But, if it is not the active application, in order to close its window, I have to enter again the application.  Is it possible to set a shortcut to close the window of TotalTerminal, even if it is not the active application?  To close it, presently, I have to make it active and then press codeescape/code. But, if possible, I would like to have also a shortcut for codecommand+W/code.  <answer120923> I think my answer to your other question largely applies here too, but to specifically answer this:  If you tick the checkbox in the TotalTerminal preferences to codeshow icon in Status Menu/code,  it should allow you to code⌘-w/code and reactivate without having to relaunch. You might also be running into issues with it emseemingly/em not reactivating due to conflicting shortcuts in various applications, in which case I recommend trying a modifier-only "hotkey". ⌥ + ⌥ seems to work well.
