How to find out process owner of unidentified windows? <body> I have an odd error that I have not been able to associate with an application or PID properly.    In Windows, there is codeProcess Explorer/code with the very handy codetarget/code function that allows you to click it and then select a window to find the owner process:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oOhxv.png" alt="target selector"  Is there a way to do something similar in OS X that will allow me to find a seemingly orphaned window's owner such as this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5FVYU.png" alt="orphaned window"  I have terminated every single process that can be terminated with the window manager running in OS X and yet I can still not isolate the owner.  <answer284557> I was also trying to figure this out and ended up using the solution described here. It's a Python script which lists all the processes with all the windows that belong to them and their coordinates on the screen. So it is not as easy to use as the Process Explorer on Windows, but it can get you the answer your are looking for. It helps if you can move the window to a place on your desktop with easily recognizable coordinates.   <comment358135> How did you figure it out in the end?
