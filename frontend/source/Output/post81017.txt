Boot Camp Assistant crashes when partitioning drive (exception: EXC_BAD_ACCESS) <body> I run Mountain Lion, a fresh install, brand new Macbook Pro. HD: Samsung 840 Pro 512 GB SSD.  When trying to go through Boot Camp Assistant / Setup it works fine until it wants to repartition my drive. It then quits unexpectedly and returns these errors:   precodeException Type:  EXC_BAD_ACCESS (SIGSEGV) Exception Codes: KERN_INVALID_ADDRESS at 0x000000000000003c /code/pre  Everything else on this new machine works like a charm. I checked permissions, verified the disk - no issues whatsoever.  I tried running the Assistant as root - it also crashes when partitioning but then in the Terminal i get a   precodeSegmentation fault: 11 /code/pre  Can anyone help me out with this?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cTeOz.png" alt="Screenshot #1" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fh00X.png" alt="Screenshot #2"  <answer86346> I just found a solution that might work for you... Unplug all the external devices that you might have (external disks, flash drives) and then start the bootcamp again.. I just did it and it worked fine for me!!! :)  <answer96767> put windows 7 or later version dvd and then you will be able to make partition with BC :)  <answer141611> Run Repair Disk on your boot partition. To accomplish this, reboot your Mac into the recovery partition, holding down âŒ˜R when you see the Apple logo. Select Disk Utility from the menu, then in the First Aid tab click Repair Disk. This may take some time. Partitioning trouble is usually a file system or disk hardware problem; this will solve the former, and a trip to the Apple store is usually needed to address the latter.   <answer173803> I remember having this issue as well when I tried using bootcamp.  I seem to remember that it was due to a fragmented drive that didn't have enough contiguous space to create the partition of the size I was requesting.  From memory, it was a bit of a pain and  I think I ended up partitioning the drive first, then reinstalling OS X on one partition and using Winclone to copy a windows machine directly to the other partition.  There may well be an easier method?  <comment93499> I have not been able to solve the issue, but i was able to find a full workaround. As Boot Camp Assistant crashes AFTER it creates the USB drive with the BC drivers for Windows, i just partitioned the harddisk again myself (in Disk Utility) and then booted up manually and normally with the Windows 7 CD, installed Windows 7 on the target partition and then installed the BC drivers from the USB drive. Everything works perfectly well. <comment93505> Great you could find a workaround. I'd suggest that you answer your own question describing the workaround as you've done in the comment and mark the answer as accepted. <comment99810> Did not work for me back then - i had nothing connected whatsoever. <comment113567> this will definetly work dude...
