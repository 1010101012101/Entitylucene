Homebrew's sbin was not found in your PATH! <body> I can't see my NTFS hard drive in finder sidebar. I have to open it from Disk Utility.  And brew doctor show this warning:     Homebrew's sbin was not found in your PATH but you have installed formulae that put executables in /usr/local/sbin. Consider setting the PATH for example like so echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/sbin:$PATH"'  ~/.bash_profile   I am all new with these stuff just want to use my old hard drive on my new Mac.  Could you please tell me how to fix this ?  <answer228866> The error message itself is telling you what to do. Open Terminal and run the command specified, by pasting this in and pressing Enter:  precodeecho 'export PATH="/usr/local/sbin:$PATH"' &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile /code/pre  <comment279103> Though I can imagine how your NTFS drive is related to brew this question is missing an explicit link between NTFS and brew doctor. Flagged unclear what you are asking. <comment279109> @klanomath The user [deleted the first time they tried to ask this](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/228752/homebrews-sbin-was-not-found-in-your-path). It's not even clear the warning is relevant without knowing what package is being brewed and whether it needs further installation steps or not.
