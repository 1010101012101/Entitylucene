Computer not installing Mac OS X after magnet damage <body> I am trying to reinstall Mac OS X on a MacBook Pro using Internet Recovery. The only partition that was there was the recovery partition so I created a new partition and used that to install Mac OS X. After a lot of waiting, the installation stopped with the error "Can't download the additional components needed to install Mac OS X." How should I fix this? I have used the suggestions here.br Thanks.  <comment330471> It's highly unlikely that your computer was damaged by a magnet. Most modern hard drives have magnetic shielding (heck, they even have *neodymium* actuator magnets [really, really close to the platters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive#Components)). And if you're using a newer MacBook Pro (later than 2012), all storage is on SSD flash, which is hardly affected by magnets. Perhaps you could clarify your laptop model?
