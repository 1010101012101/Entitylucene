Can't UsePrivilegeSeparation sandbox with Homebrew sshd <body> With OSX 10.9.5, and using the latest Homebrew OpenSSH, which at time of writing is OpenSSH_7.1p2/OpenSSL 1.0.2f, I emmust set/em the following in code/usr/local/etc/ssh/sshd_config/code:  precodeUsePrivilegeSeparation yes /code/pre  (Or comment the line out entirely I suppose)  Just to get it to work. With it set to codesandbox/code (which is the preferable and more secure default as I understand it), I get entries like this in my code/var/log/system.log/code:  precodeFeb  9 13:46:22 machine.local sshd[80808]: fatal: ssh_sandbox_child: sandbox_init: dlopen(/usr/lib/libsandbox.1.dylib, 261): image not found [preauth] /code/pre  This seems like the behavior prior to the MacPorts patches being added in late 2014. So how am I still seeing this issue? Is there any way to fix it?  <comment288510> I've got the same issue, except for me lib sandbox is complaining about the a preauth profile which seems to be missing
