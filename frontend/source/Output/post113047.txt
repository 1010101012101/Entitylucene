How do I open Outlook .msg files on my iPad <body> I work with a Document Management System that has my Outlook email archive stored as .msg files...  which is nice and all, but I can't get my iPad to actually open them up properly.   A search through the App Store results in two apps that claim to support this:  ul liMSG File Viewer ($0.99) - doesn't seem to associate itself properly with .MSG files in Safari/SkyDrive/etc./li liKlammer ($0.99 + $0.99 in-app purchase) - shows up in Open With... dialog, but shows up empty in the app./li /ul  However, neither seems to associate itself with .MSG files in Safari/SkyDrive/etc . Also, support for inline images and formatting seems sketchy at best.   I also noted that if I forward a .MSG file in an email, Mail will sometimes open it properly by converting it to .EML on the fly. I just can't figured out how to use that to open .MSG files on any other location, though.   Are there any other solutions I'm not aware of? It would be really nice to be able to access these files on the road.  <answer113344> You don't need an additional app. You can either sync your email messages to your iPad from your computer - instructions are in the user's guide as well as here:     http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1386   or you can set up your iPad to connect directly to your email provider - instructions also in the user's guide and here:     http://www.apple.com/support/ipad/mail/   If your email service is an Exchange server, I'd recommending setting up your iPad to talk directly to the server. Then your mail, calendar and contacts, if you wish it so, will synchronize automatically without you having to sync with your computer.  <comment132985> iTunes will not sync mail over USB or WiFi - only a limited subset of contact data and calendar data flows from a computer to iOS as sync. It also doesn't work with .msg files directly. <comment132993> Thanks for the answer, but the thing is these messages are not "on my computer". They are .MSG files that have been archived into a Document Management System. I can download them to the iPad just fine from there, I just can't open them.
