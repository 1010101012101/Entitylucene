Hard drive enclosure for 2.5" Sata drive <body> I am not an Apple user myself, but trying to solve a problem for a family member.  His Macbook Pro is damaged and not economical to repair, however he would like the data off the hard drive.  Do I need to find a specific type of external hard drive enclosure, or will any standard 2.5" SATA enclosure work?  Thank you!  <answer102279> MacBooks and other Apple computers that use 2.5" or 3.5" form factor drives are all standard SATA II or III, so any typical hard drive would work.
