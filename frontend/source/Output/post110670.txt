Windows on VirtualBox and special characters <body> I have a standard Apple US keyboard but I often have to type in German. I find the OS X shortcuts easy to remember and I am comfortable with them.  To type the umlauts you have to type kbdoption/kbd+kbdu/kbd (u as in emumlaut/em) followed by the letter that needs the diacritic.  When I use Windows in VirtualBox I have to fall back to the Windows combinations (e.g.kbdAltGr/kbd+kbdp/kbd for รถ) which I find difficult to remember (I don't use VirtualBox a lot).  Is there a way to map the usual OS X key combinations to Windows?  <comment130376> I haven't tried it, but according to the [VMware KB](http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?cmd=displayKC&docType=kc&docTypeID=DT_KB_1_1&externalId=1005578) you can install Apple versions of keyboard layouts on Windows by installing Boot Camp drivers. <comment130604> If I try to install the BootCamp drivers in Windows 7 (Virtual Box) I get a message that they are unsupported. <comment133580> in vmware there is a possibility to whitch key combos on mac acts as which on the vm's. maybe there is some thing similar to this on virtualbox.
