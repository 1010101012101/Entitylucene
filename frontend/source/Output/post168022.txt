Dictionary + Thesaurus items duplicated <body> How can I remove the duplicated menu items?

I am new to Mac, thank you.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NsXHP.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer168059> Go to the Preferences for Dictionary.app and uncheck everything and restart.  Then go back to the Preferences and check what you want to have showing.  <comment197070> Try going to the Preferences for Dictionary app and unchecking everything and then restart and check what you want to show. <comment197095> @TomGewecke Thank you, that worked. I found references in other languages that I'm interested in too. \o/ <comment198553> I can just check and uncheck the items, that works for me all right. No need to restart.
