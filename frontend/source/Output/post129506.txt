How should I restore a backup of my user account from a .dmg? <body> I have on my external hard drive a code.dmg/code which is a backup from when my internal hardrive was breaking.  Fixing the (internal) hard drive I then went on to erase it. And reinstall OSX in the process it asked me if I had any time machine backups. Which I do (on the same external) hard drive but it was very out of date.  What I want to know is; How can I get all the data back from the .dmg that I backed up (and have now fixed using DiskWarrior)?  hr  Should I just drag and drop the User folder? What would you reccomend?  <answer129507> ol liCopy the user folder into /Users/li liMake a user with the same short name as the user that you copied in using the Users &amp; Groups preference pane.
