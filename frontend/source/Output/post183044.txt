Recovery HD left in the middle <body> I did some partitioning to install Linux. Then I decided to erase that partition altogether. Now I am left with a configuration like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6L2bf.png" alt="current partition setup"  How can I add the free space to main partition?  <answer183065> I created a bootable usb with unetbootin and Gparted. I booted the mac with the stick. i moved my Recovery HD to the end. Then I rebooted normally, opened up Disk Utility, dragged the end of the main partition to the bottom.  <answer183069> Another solution is also posted here. It works with standard (build-in) OS X system tools. Depending on your partition table and the CoreStorage listing some slight adjustments may be necessary.  <comment218121> Please add the output of `sudo gpt -r show /dev/disk0` and `diskutil cs list` entered in Terminal.app to your question. <comment218130> Thanks for the answer. I found a solution and posted it below. <comment218137> possible duplicate of [Resizing or expanding a CoreStorage volume](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/154964/resizing-or-expanding-a-corestorage-volume) <comment218139> I dont think this was duplicate, since my main problem is that I have a RecoveryHD in the middle, which prevents extending my main HD. <comment218142> In similar cases (after installing Windows/Linux and deleting the new partition manually afterwards) the Recovery HD is always "in the middle". Check the `gpt -r -vv show /dev/disk0` example listing in the accepted answer. The Recovery HD is the 3rd partition (i=3), followed by an invisible UEFI-partition (i=4) and a lot of unallocated free space.
