iPad requires an older iCloud email address although new apple ID <body> I have bought an iPad and the previous user had iCloud set to a gmail address of them which they forgot password and have no access to.   I have set up apple ID to use my email address, but whenever I want to reset the iPad, it prompts me to sign in with the old Gmail address which of course I have no password for.  I tried upgrading to the latest iOS 10 with iTunes but did not help me get rid of that Gmail. I also tried changing my apple ID email to this gmail (I heard this might help) but it rejects that email telling it has been used before.  Is there anything I'm doing wrong? Can there be any fix?  Best, Samuel  <comment329674> I can use it normally and I am not getting any lock even though the lock check site says locked.. <comment329676> Without the original Apple ID you are severely restricted in what you can do with the iPad. I would return it to the person who sold it to you. They can then follow some of the steps described on the question I marked as a duplicate. <comment329678> You are welcome
