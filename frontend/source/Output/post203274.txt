QuickTime player only recording 10 seconds of video footage <body> I am trying to record video footage from my iPhone 6 (iOS 8.4.1) within QuickTime Player (10.4) on a MacBook Pro Running OS X Yosemite (10.10.3).br As soon as I press stop to finish the recording the timer shows 10 second of footage even though I have recorded more than this. Itâ€™s not buffering or saying that it is finishing recording and storage is not an issue as I have plenty of storage left.  The recordings I am trying to create a very short (under 1 minute) How to get record longer videos?  I don't use headphones and have 100 GB free space on my Mac  <comment246195> Are you out of space on your Mac? Also, are you using headphones to listen to the recording while you are recording it (sometimes, for whatever reason, that can cause issues)?
