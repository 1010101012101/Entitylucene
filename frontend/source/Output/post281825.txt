Change background login screen in macOS Sierra <body> I am trying desperately to change the login screen image (defaults to a blurred image) to any other image that I want. I have already tried:  ul liHow to change your login screen in macOS (and change it back)/li liHow to Change the Login Screen Background In macOS Sierra, Yosemite, and El Capitan/li liChange login screen in Sierra/li /ul  And I can garantee you, none of them work any more in macOS Sierra, they used to in previous versions of the OS, but not anymore.  I would really appreciate some help!  <answer281827> You can do this by editing system .plist's through codedefaults/code (tedious),  and you can use use Onyx for this (simple), Onyx is quite capable util and free - if you like it dontate a bit for the Author though he does a great job with this app  You can do this by launching Onyx, entering your admin password and choosing the stronglogin/strong tab: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/isye2.png" alt="Onyx login tab"  There is also ton's of other options you can check out, tinkering with strongOnyx/strong is quite secure since you can roll back to defaults with one button press, so don't worry about bricking something - but still be aware what you click ;)  strongUpdate/strong if you want to do this without any extra software you would need to edit your codedefaults/code by importing/exporting them. I wrote a script for the exporting part, it writes each codedomain/code into a separate file for easier overview and keeps system namespace/user namespace seperate + sorts out system/apple defaults from those that were changed/set by any software the user installed.  I use it mostly for filtering crap leftovers from tests to keep the defaults tidy- since the background/login is also set there- thats what you need to edit.  In some cases you might need parse binary .plist files, and this needs an editor that can parse those- easy done with TextMate (or Xcode if in need of "vanilla"). Hope that solves your problem.  Script is here export-defaults.zsh  <comment354698> Thanks but I would rather use a "vanilla" version, I don't want to install any additional software to perform this task, sorry. <comment354699> You don't have  to install anything- like I mentioned above- to do this by hand you need to change system defaults accordingly, Onyx does the same for you- hence it's simpler. If you don't know how to work with `defaults` I strongly recommend you use Onyx. <comment354702> Depends on your idea of installation - its a binary you can run without installation and delete it after without any leftovers, so there is no installation, it's not a .pkg file. What's your point here? <comment354894> Ok, I downloaded Onyx and used it without installing it, I understand now what you meant and it worked, my apologies and thanks again! I am curious though, is really that difficult to override that specific default? Maybe is just a couple commands I'd like to know ;) <comment354907> No apology needed, just keep openminded to any answer, you will never know. You can set most of the system stuff through `defaults`, there is plenty of 3rd party apps (Onyx being one) which are a fancy interface/editor to `defaults`, checkout `dotfiles` on github and check the script, you can fiddle inside those files with TextMate. You can basically do almost everything system-wise from the command-line. We could (unjustly) simplify that macOS is a fancy UI that sits on top of Darwin, which is a BSD offshot with Apple "innovations" added.
