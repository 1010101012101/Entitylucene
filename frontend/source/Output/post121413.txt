How to Open .dist extension as folder on Mac OS X? <body> I'am currently developing Java application with Eclipse IDE and having this folder named "workspace.dist". This contains the deployed portlet to be deployed to a framework. Now my problem is, Mac OS recognizes workspace.dist as TextMate extension (a text editor). For the mean time, I had to "Show Package Content" thru context menu to open this file.   So my question is if there a way to associate .dist extension as Finder?  Thank you!  <answer121417> ol liQuit TextMate and open code/Applications/TextMate.app/Contents/Info.plist/code in a text editor./li liRemove the highlighted content from line 531 per the screenshot below:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LYaTn.png" width="550"/li liLog out and back in./li /ol  <comment141530> I did what you'd instructed but the "workspace.dist" still associated with TextMate. <comment141581> @Erize It should have workedâ€¦ Reboot? <comment141956> I already did rebooting the OS but still no good. I've also already searched keywoard "dist" inside the TextMate's Info.plist and it has no result so I don't know why dist extension still associated with TextMate.
