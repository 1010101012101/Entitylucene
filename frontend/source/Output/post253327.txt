What are the steps to burning a Blu-ray Disc from a home movie on a Mac? <body> We've uploaded a bunch of miniDV tapes to our iMac computer (2011 model).  We have a Samsung external Blu-ray burner we'd like to use to copy the movies onto.  What steps would one take to copy the movies from iMovie to the Blu-ray Disc with the goal of trying to retain the highest quality audio and video possible?  If there is a recommended set of applications we'll need, we'd appreciate any advice.
