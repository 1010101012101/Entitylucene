How to make Safari remember zoom level per site? <body> Safari's default font size is not large enough for my eyes so I have to press kbd⌘/kbd+kbd+/kbd for a while on every website I visit. I could've used CSS to set the default zoom level in Safari but I want different zoom levels for Twitter, Facebook, StackOverflow, etc.  Is there an extension or other way available to make Safari remember strongper-site/strong zoom level settings?  <answer25532> Yes,  There is an extension for this called ZoomBySite. Here is a description of the software from it's website:     ZoomBySite is a Safari Extension that will automatically zoom each   site to the zoom level of your last visit to the site. A site is   defined by a unique domain name (so www.apple.com is considered   different from store.apple.com and each could have its own unique zoom   level).      It does this by intercepting the Zoom In and Zoom Out keyboard   shortcuts [...]. It zooms the page in or out by   the desired amount (see the Preferences section below) and also stores   the zoom level for the site. As each page loads, it checks to see if   there is a stored zoom level and sets it again for the current   viewing. If you change the zoom level of a site, any other tabs or   windows that are open to that site will also change their zoom level.   <answer90100> The Quickstyle Safari Extension has served this purpose well for me.  In particular it allows changing strongonly the font size/strong or virtually any other very detailed change.  Click the toolbar icon (or use the keyboard shortcut) and select the element on the page that you'd like to apply changes to (emor/em any element) to bring up the editor pre-filled with a rule that will apply to whatever you selected.  img src="https://i.imgur.com/OeSsahg.png" alt="screenshot1"  If you want to apply very generally simply rename the rule to codebody/code.  If you'd like to double the font size you would enter:  precodefont-size: 200% !important; /code/pre  The site should re-render as soon as you've saved the rule.  <comment29330> For some reason, it didn't work for me the first few launches but eventually it started hooking keyboard shortcuts, as promised. Amazing. Thanks! <comment89587> It doesn't work. <comment118354> Quickstyle also remembers the zoom setting like ZoomBySite <comment135773> Works for me. The built-in zoom kb shortcuts work well with this extension. <comment135791> I take back my words: it works but constantly forgets zoom for tabs; also, zoom levels between individual tabs interfere with zoom levels in other tabs—in short: too buggy to be useful at this time (at least on my MBP)
