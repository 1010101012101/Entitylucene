How to get the hash linked to a GeneratedUID in El Capitan? <body> Trying to find the GeneratedUID in OS X still works (see example below):   precodedscl localhost -read /Search/Users/&lt;username&gt; | grep GeneratedUID | cut -c15- /code/pre  But entering the following into the command line, replacing code&lt;GeneratedUID&gt;/code with the GeneratedUID found above:  precodecat /var/db/shadow/hash/&lt;GeneratedUID&gt; | cut -c169-216 /code/pre  leads to nowhere. This worked in earlier versions of OS X.  Where is the hash located in El Capitan now?  <answer213946> The hashes of the users are stored in a different place since 10.7:  precode/var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/users/&lt;user&gt;.plist /code/pre  To get the shadow hash enter:  precodesudo defaults read /var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/users/&lt;user&gt;.plist ShadowHashData | tr -dc '0-9a-f ' | xxd -p -r | plutil -convert xml1 - -o - /code/pre  or directly through directory services:  precodesudo dscl . read /Users/&lt;user&gt; AuthenticationAuthority /code/pre  and   precodesudo dscl . read /Users/&lt;user&gt; dsAttrTypeNative:ShadowHashData /code/pre  <comment258201> cannot get hash from GUID anymore in El Capitan... <comment258242> Triple bonus for figuring out what the user wanted. I was stuck on machine UUID initially. +1 <comment258418> OMG thats awesome thank you so much wow this is a fabulous community! <comment258421> @HenryDanielson What do you need the hashes for? Password cracking? <comment258543> yes i was learning how to use John the Ripper I am a technolgy director white hat not for black hat use :) I tried and it didnt work I even logged into root :( Thanks I guess I am missing something <comment347213> I dont have root access, though, so how would you suggest getting this hash? I am also firmware locked out, so I can't use SUM, and my account isn't opped, its official status is "Managed, Mobile"
