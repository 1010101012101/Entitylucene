In Numbers, how can I sum only if adjacent cell is certain value? <body> In excel, as shown here, it is possible to find and sum only cells with have a specific value next to them.  img src="https://www.extendoffice.com/images/stories/doc-excel/doc-sumif-adjacent-cell-equal-blank/doc-sum-adjacent-cell-2.png" alt="=SUM(IF(A4:E10=A13, B4:F10, 0))"  Is there a way to do a similar thing in numbers?  Specifically, I have a very long table like this:  precodeType of Job | Amount Earned ------------+-------------- Labour      | 10 Labour      | 15 Office      | 27 Labour      | 10 Tutoring    | 20 Labour      | 5 Office      | 24 Tutoring    | 20 /code/pre  And I'd like to find out how much money I've made from jobs of type codeLabour/code, codeOffice/code and codeTutoring/code separately. I can't just sum the codeAmount Earned/code column, because that would only give me the total of emall/em Job Types, instead I want their totals separately.  Any help appreciated!  <answer209101> I found out that you can use the codeSUMIF/code function to accomplish this:  precodeSUMIF(test-range, condition, sum-range) /code/pre
