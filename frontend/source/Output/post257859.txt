Calendar keeps popping up new events for 3 years ago <body> I have calendar connected to an Office 365 mailbox. Ever since Sierra, I have a couple meetings from 2013 that keep getting added to the calendar that I deleted long ago. The worst part is, these invitations bring Calendar into focus (stealing focus) as if I just added the events manually.   A lot of these events don't even make sense, being titled "Accepted:", "Declined:", or "Tentative:" for real meetings but without any invitees. How can I prevent Calendar from continuously dredging up these old events and pulling focus away from my current task?  Eventually Calendar crashes due to this, and reopening it restarts the process.  I've removed and re-added the account, and cleared the calendar caches with no luck.
