Safari can’t establish a secure connection to the server www.google.com <body> If I try to navigate to any of the following pages:  ul lihttp://google.com/reader/li lihttps://encrypted.google.com//li /ul  I get an error message in Safari saying:     Safari can't open the page "https://encrypted.google.com/" because   Safari can’t establish a secure connection to the server   "encrypted.google.com"   I also find that on the Gmail page many images are missing and when I try to go the image location I see the same error as above. Here's a pic of the missing images:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7WWkC.png" alt="enter image description here"  In chrome I have the same issue but with a different error as follows:     Error 107 (net::ERR_SSL_PROTOCOL_ERROR): SSL protocol error.   I am not using a proxy and this behaviour has started recently for seemingly no apparent reason although I did get a new router about 2 weeks ago. strongWhy am I experiencing  these problems?/strong  <answer282646> The issue was a temporary change and you should have an excellent chance of secure browsing from the main google entry page and all shipping versions of Safari.   ul lihttps://www.google.com/li /ul  Things could change next month, but lately google has served up rock solid https using certificate trust chains that Apple has included in all OS they ship.   <comment146289> I don't know if this is related to your issue or not, but there has been a *lot* of chatter in security circles about SSL/TLS issues lately (and not just Apple's problem.)  Many servers have been reconfigured to stop supporting a lot of older configurations known to be insecure, and I expect there to be issues where SSL/TLS just plain won't work for at least a little while. <comment146291> Couple things to check. 1. Did you visit China recently? 2. What version of Mac OS X? 3. DNS servers, what are they? 4. Version of Chrome? Version of Safari? My first thought is that there is some redirection going on when you visit those named domains, which could be related to DNS. second would be invalid certs. <comment300421> Is this happening with any other HTTPS websites? Is your time and date correct? Is your copy of Chrome, Safari and OS X up to date?
