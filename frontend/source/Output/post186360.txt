How to recover a deleted account (the home account was also deleted) <body> I am running a mac osx version 10.9.5  I have 2 administrators running in my mac (admin A and admin B). admin A is the primary account that I am using and it contains all my files there. I was supposed to delete admin B but I accidentally deleted admin A and chose the 3rd option which is to delete the home folder. I thought that I was selecting admin B but it turns out I deleted admin A. Yes I know, I am stupid. Now I can't see my files even if I look into Macintosh hd/Users/ there is no admin A folder or admin A (deleted user) folder but when I viewed my total storage space, It still has the same capacity before I stupidly deleted my primary account (admin A).   What should i do? I have important files there and no matter what I do I can't access it now. I would really appreciate and hope that you answer me.  <comment219980> If the same capacity is reported, that could mean that the Home folder may still be present in your `.Trashes` folder. How did you go about deleting the account (what method did you use)? <comment220120> i went to system preferences, users & groups then clicked the minus sign (under the login options), then i was prompted if i was sure to delete the user account then i chose the third option (delete the home folder) and i was not sure if i also checked the erase home folder securely. i forgot then i clicked delete user. <comment220121> and also when i look at Finder it says that i have 400.51 GB available but when i go to about mac, then storage it says that i have 243.83 GB free out of 499.25 GB (this was the total storage before i deleted the account)
