How to revert OS X Snow Leopard default theme? <body> Yesterday I tried to change my OS X default theme so I installed many themes one of them was Aqua Extreme. Non of them give me what I was looking for as a result I revert pack to default theme using ThemePark program but icons in the main menu lost its shadow. Is it possible to return pack to default theme settings?  Thanks  <answer12474> Aqua Extreme comes with a separate package called Remove Aqua Extreme which restores the default user interface.    If you download the latest Aqua Extreme from http://www.maxthemes.com/downloads/Aqua%20Extreme.dmg you will find the Remove Aqua Extreme package inside the installation bundle.  Run this package, it should restore everything.
