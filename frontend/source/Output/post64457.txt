Stop finder using cover flow in icon view <body> I am using Mac OSX 10.8 Mountain Lion and one of the finder features that really annoys me is that when i try to sort files by 'Date Created' in icon view it separates them into sections such as 'Yesterday', 'Previous 7 Days' etc. and uses a cover flow like effect to browse through them. These sections mean that to browse i have to scroll emalong/em each section then  move emdown/em to the next and scroll along that one.  Is there any way to stop finder from using this feature?  Thanks in advance, Ben.  <answer64462> ol liRight click in the folder you have the problem./li liSelect Arrange by  None./li liRight click again and select Clean up by  Date Created./li /ol  <comment75723> Thank you!
