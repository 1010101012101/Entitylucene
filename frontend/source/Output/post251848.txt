Can I upgrade a 13-inch display to retina display on a macbook pro? <body> I have a MacBook Pro (13-inch, Mid 2012, intel core i5 with an SSD and 16 gig of RAM and an Intel HD Graphics 4000 1536 MB) and I'm wondering if it's possible to upgrade only the screen. Will it have adverse effect on the Wifi antenna or some problems with the internal hardware/firmware for the display camera?   I know that for early 2011, it's not possible but maybe later versions?  <comment313160> The question asked about an early 2011 15" display. I thought that it could be different with a mid 2012 13" display. I don't know what was his graphic card, but maybe mine is working? Or maybe only the connector is not working? <comment313162> True, but you can follow the accepted answer to iFixit and that site should be able to answer your question.
