How do I configure CURL to use the same root certificates as Safari? <body> It seems that CURL on OS X (10.10) is broken because it does not contain the same set of root SSL certificates as Safari.   Due to this it seems that there is a high chance for your to be unable to use curl with some HTTPS sites.  I observed that there is a guide on getting a list of certificates from  http://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem but this seems bad for two reasons:  ul liYou are forced to get the certificates using HTTP instead of HTTPS so with minimal effort someone could give you a wrong list of certificates./li liThese may get outdated and I would prefer to use the same set of root certificates as the rest of the OS./li /ul  What steps can be taken to get curl to match Safari when accessing web certificates?  <comment206327> Related: http://serverfault.com/a/394835 <comment206465> @AllInOne thanks for the link, clearly useful. Still, I am looking for a better solution, one that would make curl on OS X to behave similar to the browsers. I see no point on keeping the cacert in more than one place. Once we find a workaround, we can raise bugs with Apple to fix it.
