How to change external volume folder permissions <body> I have a shared folder in a NAS (Synology DS115j) I mount this folder with the following command:  precodemount_smbfs //admin:password@server/shared-folder /Volumes/shared-folder /code/pre  codeshared-folder/code shows the following permissions:  precodedrwxrwxrwx  1 admin  staff /code/pre  A local user wants to execute the following command  precodesudo -u username ls /Volumes/shared-folder /code/pre  And she gets the following error  precodePermission denied /code/pre  How is this possible when all users are given rwx permissions?  How can I fix it?  <comment320370> is the user admin or staff? <comment320371> The user trying to read belongs to another group and I tried to change owner (I use batChmod) without success <comment320373> You need to change their group then, or add ACL to cover the group they *are* in <comment320374> I can't execute `sudo chown`I get an `Operation not permitted` error message. I would like to understand why. <comment320376> on a remote NAS, no idea. Depends on your own permissions on there... <comment320403> Please edit your post with the exact command and path for `chown` and `ls`. Also, edit your post with the name and model of your NAS and the command and results of `mount` <comment320418> @fd0 I've made the changes you suggested
