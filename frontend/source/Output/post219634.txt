Would you consider editing in the method you use to determine the hash? That will help many more people than just listing the result. <comment268312> Check out https://github.com/drduh/OS-X-Security-and-Privacy-Guide/blob/master/InstallESD_Hashes.csv <comment268570> @uwotm8 Really good, I have been looking for that long time, and if I have found that early, I won't have this question!
