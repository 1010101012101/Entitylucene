How can I compare file structures before and after a software install? <body> I'm writing a new formula for Homebrew for some software I maintain and as part of my testing I'd like to ensure that files are emonly/em added to the correct places on install and that emall/em files are removed on uninstall.  What's the best way of going about comparing file structures before and after my test installs and uninstalls?  <answer40812> Two ways occur to me off the top of my head:   ul lifseventer is an app that uses Apple's FSEvents framework to watch the filesytem change live. Be sure to read the warnings and caveats on the developer's website./li liMake a copy of the relevant directories (to someplace convenient, like your desktop) before performing the action. You can then use FileMerge (comes with the developer utilities) to compare directories./li /ul  <answer40834> In Terminal I can think of two choice:  ol licodels -R/code./li licodetree directory-name//code (after you install it; i.e. codebrew install tree/code). The slash at the end preserves the display of special characters in the file the output is saved to./li /ol  In both case you redirect the output to a file before and after installation and compare the two files possibly using Apple FileMerge.app shipped with Xcode.  <answer42536> I like using "find" and "shasum" for this sort of task.  Two different invocations, 1 for the structure, and another for the sha-1's of the files:  precodefind -s /path/to/directory -ls &gt; files-before.txt find -s /path/to/directory -type f -exec shasum \{} \+ &gt;&gt; files-before.txt /code/pre  Run your installs/uninstalls, and then use the same process to "files-after.txt".  Then  precodediff files-before.txt files-after.txt /code/pre  <comment46228> Obviously not what you asked for, but still useful for a similar task is 'lsbom'.
