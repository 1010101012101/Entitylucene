Why is search in Activity Monitor disabled? <body> The search on my activity monitor app is disabled/grayed out. I can't figure out how to enable it.  Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!  emps: mac noob here, be gentle please! :)/em  <answer192216> The search doesn't function when Activity Monitor's view is set to "All Processes, Hierarchically". Open the view menu and change it to anything else, and it'll activate again.  <comment331815> Almost correct: it also doesn't work when you have "Applications in the last 8 hours" selected...
