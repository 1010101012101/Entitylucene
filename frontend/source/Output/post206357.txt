My email is gone and my daughters is there instead <body> My daughter used my phone for a day and now her email address is on my phone and mine has vanished. How do I get mine back?  <answer206359> I am assuming you're using an iPhone.  ol liFirst go into Settings, scroll down and you should see "Mail, Contacts, Calendars". Tap on this item and you will see all the accounts that has been added to the phone./li liFrom there you can go to your daughter's account, disable her email, and go to your account and enable your email. That should solve the problem./li /ol  Here's a screenshot of the Mail item.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ACcKU.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment249189> Nicole, I hope the answer I submitted is useful.
