Fast user Switching remains disabled <body> Even when I unlock the emFast User Switching/em functionality, using an admin account, the menu remains disabled.  What could be causing this? And, how could I solve it?  <comment82400> What do you mean with *disabled*? Could you elaborate on that, or even, add a screenshot? <comment82403> Disabled means the way it remains before you have clicked the lock icon in the bottom left to unlock admin account. Sorry i am not able to post a screenshot @Thecafremo <comment82408> Have you * cough * got more than one user? <comment82417> Yes ,Sir I do have more than one user on my system, thats why I ask what;s wrong with this. Can there be any script or any system files which has got deleted that has caused this ?
