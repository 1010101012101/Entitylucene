Default Output Device is always wrong <body> Since updating to Yosemite, whenever I plug headphones into my MBP, it selects Soundflower as the default output device. I then have to manually change it everytime. Anyone know why this is happening, or how to fix it? Also, I can't get rid of Soundflower for some reason.  <answer167087> Uninstall Soundflower. There should be an uninstaller located at:  precode/Applications/Soundflower/Uninstall Soundflower.scpt /code/pre  Run it, enter your password, and strongreboot/strong (very important). If it's not there, upgrade Soundflower first here.  strongEDIT:/strong You can set your default audo device by going to /Applications/Utilities and opening codeAudio MIDI Setup/code. Select the device you want to use, click the gear, and then codeUse this device for sound output/code.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ia14Z.png" alt="Audio MIDI Setup" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7lTRi.png" alt="Use this device for sound output"  <answer167088> First of all, I'll address the stronghow to uninstall Soundflower/strong problem:  A number of people have run into problems uninstalling it in the past. The main problem seems to be that you have to reboot your machine after running the uninstaller but if that doesn't work for you try removing it from the Audio MIDI setup.   Open Audio MIDI Setup in the utilities folder and look for Soundflower listed there, select it and click the minus near the bottom left to remove it.  hr  Now that you've removed Soundflower, you need to strongset the headphones as your default output device:/strong  ol liConnect your headphones/li liOpen System Preferences and Open the "Sound" panel/li liGo to the "Output" tab/li liSelect your headphones here/li liClose system preferences/li /ol  Your system should now default to the headphones whenever you plug them in.  hr  If you run into further problems, you can try a couple of strongadvanced steps:/strong  ol liOpen Finder and in the "Go" menu, select "Go to Folder..."/li liType ~/Library/Preferences and click Go/li liLocate two files called strongcom.apple.systempreferences.plist/strong and strongcom.apple.audio.AudioMIDISetup.plist/strong and move them both to the trash/li liReboot your computer/li liIf you're still having problems reset PRAM by rebooting again and holding command-option-p-r as soon as your computer boots up, keep holding until your computer restarts again and you hear the startup chime./li /ol  Follow all the above steps from the beginning of this post and one of them should solve your problem, make sure you check each time if your headphones are now working by default.  <answer237746> Restart the computer, select the output device you want, restart again, then look in System Preferences again to see if it saved as the setting you previously had.   <comment195893> I'd prefer to learn how to permanently set the default audio output device. I have a couple of other output devices that I do occasionally use that I don't want to uninstall. <comment195894> @Kevin I updated my answer. <comment197182> Sorry I took a while to give you the bounty.
