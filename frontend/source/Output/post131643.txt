macbook air 2008 model want to install ubuntu <body> hi I want to install Ubuntu 12.04 or the latest version in my MacBook air. I had formatted my hard drive and there is no other os's installed, so how I can install Ubuntu on mac directly.  I also tried fedora 12 its working directly but I want use Ubuntu on it.. please help..  thanks   <answer131649> I found this description of how to do it : http://regebro.wordpress.com/2008/11/16/installing-linux-on-a-macbook-without-os-x/  Basically what is suggested there is to install OS X on an external drive, boot from it, format the internal drive and install rEFIt on the internal drive. Then install Ubuntu from the Live CD and it should all be good.  See the link for all the details.  hr  There is also an installation guide on ubuntu.com, a running OS X installation is required to start with though. Depending on how you formatted your drive you still should be able to boot into the recovery partition. If this doesn't work you may need access to another computer at least temporary.  <comment154695> This question appears to be off-topic because it is about non-supported OS on a Macbook (Ubuntu) <comment154696> The hardware is Apple though, and the answer would be specific to Apple hardware
