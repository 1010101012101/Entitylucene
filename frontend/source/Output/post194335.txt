Restore a repaired iPhone 5 from backup <body> I had a ton of problems with my iPhone 5. I backed it up and took it to the Apple Store. I got a loaner while getting it fixed and put the latest iPhone backup on loaner phone. Then I got my iPhone back and went to restore from same backup, butd it's not in my options in iTunes. Where could I find this restore point as it has everything in it? Any help would be great. Thank you.   <answer194346> You have to make a backup of the loaner phone to have it available to restore on your repaired phone.  You already appear to have done so on your phone, but if needed, steps described by Apple are:     h2Make a backup using iTunes/h2      ol   liOpen iTunes and connect your device to your computer. /li   liSave content that you downloaded from the iTunes Store or App Store by clicking File  Devices  Transfer Purchases.

Perhaps you were sent back a replacement iPhone, running a slightly older version of iOS? If the backup is from a newer version of iOS than the target device, iTunes won't show it as an option.  The best thing to do is to first double-check that the backup is there, by going to the Devices section of the iTunes Preferences window. That will show you all of the backups iTunes recognizes as backups :) Let's make sure the backup you want is still listed there.
