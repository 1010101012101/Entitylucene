partition map check failed because no slices were found <body> I own an early 2011 MacBook Pro running Mac OS X Mavericks. Recently, I tried to make 50 GB partition using Disk Utility but the whole process didn't complete, and I had to restart the system as it hanged (Even Force Quit wasn't working). Upon reboot, I saw that I was missing 50GB space. When I tried to verify the disk, it showed me the following error:  "Partition map check failed because no slices were found."  Can I fix it without using external drive? Please help.  <answer119052> ol liReboot into Single User Mode (hold cmd-S on boot)/li liRun code/sbin/fsck -fy/code  supcodefsck/code is File System Consistency checK. code-f/code forces the process, and code-y/code assumes yes.br This will basically run Disk Utility's Repair Disk, but outside of the OS so that is has full read/write to the disk./sup/li liOnce complete, codereboot/code/li /ol  <answer160198> Run the fstab command and remove all the setting there, then write the command.

(And options to repartition are greyed out.) How might I modify this command to help me? <comment210997> Did the accepted solution solve your problem? <comment226572> How do you target an external drive with this command? <comment226573> @Alex I've not tried this in single user mode, but once you've mounted the disk, you should be able to do it with `sudo /sbin/fsck_hfs -fy /dev/disk1s1` <comment285725> Please give a few details related to the link.
