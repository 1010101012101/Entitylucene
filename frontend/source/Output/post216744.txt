OSX El Capitan / Not Recognizing USB Hard Drive <body> I updated to OSX El Capitan a few weeks ago, and ever since I did so, my computer is having some issues with my Seagate USB 3.0 hard drive.  In terminal, when I use the disk utility, the drive shows up, but it generally will not mount.  I say generally, because occasionally the drive will mount, but it is unusable (Time Machine and disk utility give me issues).   I have tried reformatting the drive with no luck - the disk utility says that it cannot unmount the drive.  Any thoughts?  Happy to take screen shots if needed.  <answer220224> I have a Seagate external drive and found that the NTFS for Mac OS X had to be removed and reinstalled. (Apple logo / Preferences / NTFS for Mac OS X - right click and remove)  This link will take you to the free update.  It worked for my Seagate drive but no my Octigen one. http://www.seagate.com/gb/en/support/downloads/item/ntfs-driver-for-mac-os-master-dl/  <comment262053> What is the model of the drive? <comment262211> @NicolasMartin the drive is a seagate srd00f1 <comment267989> I appreciate the help, but it's not working for me.  Still not recognizing the drive even though the drive is lit up (the light)
