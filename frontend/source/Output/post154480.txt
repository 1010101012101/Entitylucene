Disabling warnings in iWork <body> Is there any way of disabling the warning popups in the current versions of Numbers, Pages and Keynote that popup when files are opened? For example:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SEL2y.png" alt=""  They are pretty useless warnings, in the sense that they have never changed how I worked with a document in a given session, so was hoping I could simply shut them off. Maybe a hidden preference?  <answer154483> If you save out the files in a Pages format you will not get the errors. You generally only get those errors when trying to open documents from Microsoft Word or something similar. I am pretty sure there is no way to disable the warning though from the preferences or anything.
