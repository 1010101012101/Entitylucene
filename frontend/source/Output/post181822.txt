How to force the new 10.10.3 Photo app to open in full screen after restart? <body> Every time I start my new photo app, it NEVER starts in full-screen. Even if its was previously closed in full-screen!  <answer183101> System Preferences  General  Uncheck "Close windows when quitting an application".  <comment216298> same for me...bug? <comment216383> Do other apps resume with their window state? Is it just Photos.app? <comment216501> Yes, I have the same with Firefox. And a bit different with Acrobat Pro as it doesn't start at all after a system restart (but if manually started, it starts in full-screen!)
