Can't tell what keyboard <body> Here's what my macbook thinks my keyboard is:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MsvzT.png" alt="Show Keyboard Viewer"img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/V9D4L.png" alt="Keyboard Viewer"  With a 'grave' backtick character in the bottom-left, next to the left shift button. ` &lt;-- this character  But when I press that button, it types a section character: §§  and when I press the button that emshould/em type a section character it types a backtick ``  I think it might be because I plugged in a different keyboard today.  <comment349716> The Mac thinks it's British... though it's added a hash symbol before it, which I've never seen before & though it shows an extended keyboard it doesn't have F16-F19 & also shows a ? where Fn ought to be - so best guess is it thinks it might be British PC. What do you think it should be? See https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201794 <comment349736> #British is my custom keyboard layout, which has worked forever until I plugged a windows (is this even a thing?) keyboard into my mac the other day. <comment349737> Definitely looks like it's recognised a Windows [PC] keyboard. This has lots of answers on how to persuade it to re-recognise a keyboard - http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/167291/suddenly-apple-wired-keyboard-not-working <comment349743> @Tetsujin hmm, but those all seem to be for external keyboards. The keyboard _of my mac_ is the one that's acting up <comment349744> yet it started after you plugged another keyboard in... <comment349827> I just tried plugging another usb device into that slot. Nothing changed.
