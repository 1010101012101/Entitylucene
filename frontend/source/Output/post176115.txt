Partitions shows it is 2GB when it is actually 120GB <body> After messing with the partitions to install Ubuntu, the hfs+ partition which I use for my user data went from 130GB to 2GB (OSX is on a separate partition). Disk Utility shows this partition as inaccessible and cannot repair it.  Software shows that the file system is bigger than partition, I have not overwritten the location so I hope the data is still there.  I can only login to a guest account, not my user account. I can log into Ubuntu if anything can be done through there All my data, photos, etc are in the area. Please can someone help me restore it.  <comment207836> Please add some Mac CLI output like `diskutil list` and `sudo gpt -r -vv show /dev/diskNumber` with diskNumber found in diskutil list (probably disk1). <comment207838> Hope you had proper a backup before you modified the partition layout and installed Ubuntu as you'll probably need to recover your data from backup.
