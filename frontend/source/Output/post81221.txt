How do I get Wi-Fi info from within Terminal? <body> Is there a way to get BSSID and the list of available Wi-Fi networks from within Terminal?  I.e. I'm looking for something similar to codeifconfig run0 scan/code on OpenBSD, which lists all access points, BSSID, signal strength etc.  <answer81222> There's an airport utility buried that you'll want to use. Create a symbolic link in /usr/local/bin to the utility for quick access with this command:  codesudo ln -s /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport /usr/local/bin/airport/code  Now, you should be able to run codeairport -s/code and get a list of available networks with BSSIDs.  If you hold the option key while opening the WiFi networks in the Menu Bar, you can also see the BSSIDs one at a time, although it seems like you wanted the CLI-like version from OpenBSD.  strongUPDATE:/strong  "rootless" AKA System Integrity Protection (SIP) has been added to OSX since I wrote this answer originally, which makes code/usr/bin/code and code/usr/sbin/code emread-only/em. It is proper to use code/usr/local/bin/code, so I have updated the answer so that the symbolic link is created there.  <answer221536> precodesudo iwlist wlan0 scan | grep ESSID /code/pre  <answer241973> This worked in linux terminal:  sudo iwlist wlan0 scan  <comment93703> Better than creating a symlink would likely be to create an alias in your shell initialization. `alias airport="/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport"` Doesn't need sudo privileges hence is available for non-admin users alike and doesn't affect other users. <comment94654> 1) "Better" is relative. If you are the only user of a Mac, then non-admin users and other users are not a concern, and having the command linked somewhere in your $PATH which means you can use it in other scripts and shells (although I'd opt to link it to /usr/local/bin/). 2) The `airport` command has been at that path at least since 10.6 and possibly earlier, for people who are concerned about backwards compatibility. It is still there in 10.8 as well. <comment94659> I suggested the symbolic link for the same reason TJ suggested, because you have got to have it linked to your $PATH, so I figured maybe the symbolic link would be less likely to give issues. Plus, many users do not use (or know how to use) .profile or .bash_profile. Both solutions work perfectly well :) <comment268237> `sudo: iwlist: command not found`. Which OS X version are you using? <comment268245> `iwlist` is a Linux tool. http://www.labs.hpe.com/personal/Jean_Tourrilhes/Linux/Tools.html <comment297446> lol, OS X answers here, please!
