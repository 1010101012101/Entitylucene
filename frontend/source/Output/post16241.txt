Software/utility to completely erase cookies/cache <body> What software (or using any other in-built tools) can I use to clear (by clear, I mean scrub from the disk) the cache &amp; cookies in browsers, without affecting the bookmarks etc. I use firefox 4.  Does deleting them from the browser and running disk util to write zeros on the free space do the trick? Also, this is a shared laptop, so not much chance of drastic steps.  <answer16251> The easiest way is to use a free (or paid) utility to do it for you.  Onyx is a free one that does the job, you have an option to clear your browser's different values:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DZuGM.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Cocktail is a paid ($14.95) nice utility too, that does what Onyx does and the UI is a little bit more elegant and give you some more flexibility:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SU4kk.jpg" alt="Cocktail"  Of course, you will have to make sure that you securely empty your thrash if you really want to make sure nobody has access to deleted stuff.   Cocktail has a nice option that may interest you in this regard:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UYAyk.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  â€¦which should cover your secure concerns :)   (if OnyX has a secure delete, I couldn't find it in the preferences).  <answer20402> I have used Cocktail for many years and I am quite happy with it. It has many other useful features.  <comment17759> Do these clean Firefox cookies which are not in ~/Library/Cookies ? <comment17777> @Mark I cannot confirm that at the moment, but I'll test (I have Cocktail).
