cDock - Finder too close to edge <body> Attempting to make a Tiger-like dock on Mavericks. Slight bug in cDock 2 program:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fGF59.jpg" alt="cDock Finder bug"  What I'm hoping for:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/q5Wz2.jpg" alt="What it should look like..."  Is there a .plist file I can edit to bring my Finder icon away from the far left edge? Thanks!  <comment290769> I don't know how to fix it by editing the .plist file, but it's caused by having the magnification or length of the dock at it's longest and having Handoff enabled on an iPhone or iPad. The easy fix is making your dock a little less wide to give the handoff app a place to reside on the far left. <comment290794> I don't have Handoff. How exactly do you go about making the dock less wide? <comment290797> There is a vertical line between the Download folder and your first docked application in the lower right. If you mouse-over it, the cursor will turn into up/down arrows. Click it and drag it downward. This will reduce the width of your dock. <comment290798> To check if you're using Handoff, go to "Settings  Handoff & Suggested Apps" on your iPad or iPhone and see if it's switched on. <comment290799> You're right, it was on on my phone. But how does that affect my Mac, which isn't connected to the phone? Also, changing the width doesn't seem to affect the icon either... <comment290805> Your phone connected to your Mac in that they both use the same AppleID and iCloud settings. Try this. Open Safari on your iPhone while sitting in front of your Mac. You should see a Safari icon appear on the far left side of your dock. If you click it, the page you were viewing on your iPhone will open on your Mac. That's "Handoff." You may have to reduce the width on your dock and then restart your Mac to fix the icon width. But as soon as it's back to normal, if you reduced the width on your dock, it won't cut it off anymore. <comment290820> I think that Handoff only comes with Yosemite and El Capitain. I'm using Mavericks. <comment290822> Weird! It's fixing itself as I remove icons from the Dock.
