Google Maps: mark road as Closed on iPhone/mobile (Directions) <body> Is there a way to mark a road as Closed in Google Maps Directions on a mobile phone (iPhone but likely to be the same on Android)?  So that the itinerary is changed, avoiding that closed road.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/85Umi.png" alt="enter image description here"  emNote/emsup1/sup on the desktop version the road is to be "report as closed", but didn't see that on the mobile version.  emNote/emsup2/sup any other solution that makes Maps avoid that road is welcome as well.  <comment370444> There is a workaround:  Mark it as closed on the Waze mobile app.  As that is owned by Google it feeds into Google Maps. <comment370456> Are you sure? Yesterday met a road that was closed in Waze by someone else, but G Maps didn't have it..
