What does this kernel panic log mean? Macbook pro 13" from Nov 2010 <body> My MacBook Pro 13" from Nov 2010 isn't booting, but stopping on the initial grey screen with the spinning wheel. I have a panic error log (below) which I don't understand.  I ran Disk utility and it repaired some errors and said said it was verified ok I ran codefsck -fy/code and it said “FILE SYSTEM WAS MODIFIED.” and I ran it again then it said "The volume [your Mac’s name] appears to be OK"  I ran safe mode and I got the following on the screen:  precodepanic(cpu 0 caller 0xffffff80006c3451): "Unable to find driver for this platform: \"ACP\".\n"@/SourceCache/xnu/xnu-2422.115.4/iokit/Kernel/IOPlatformExpert.cpp :1533 Debugger called: &lt;panic&gt; Backtrace (CPU 0), Frame : Return Address 0xffffff808d163dc0 : 0xffffff8000222f79 0xffffff808d163340 : 0xffffff80006c3451 ((((5 more lines which seem to change when ever i restart safe mode))) 0 0 0 0 BSD process name corresponding to current thread: Unknownn Boot args: -x Mac OS version: Not yet set Kernel version: Darwin Kernel Version 13.4.0: Sun Aug 17 19;50;11 PDT 2014; root:xnu-2422.115.4~1/RELEASE_X86_64 Kernel UUID: 9477416E-7BCA-3679-AF97-E1EAAD3DD5A0 System uptime in nanoseconds: 404359510 /code/pre  hr  The exact model is MacBook Pro 13inch 2.4GHz (Intel Core 2 Duo, 4Gb RAM, 250Gb HDD, NVIDIA GeForce 320M graphics  from Nov 2010
