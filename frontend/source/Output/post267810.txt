iTunes purchasing trouble <body> I just bought iPhone 2 or 3 months ago. In the past few weeks I tried to buy songs on iTunes. Recently I purchased a song on iTunes, but then I just clicked the downloading button with no purpose. It was written purchased. But I cant play the song on my music.   How can I fix this while I can't even re-download the song on iTunes?  <comment336145> What is the model of your iPhone? What is the iOS version? Can you attach some screenshot to compliment your description of the issue?
