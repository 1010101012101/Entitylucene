Does the Mac "Do Not Disturb" function affect Skype calls? <body> If I use Notification Center's "Do Not Disturb" toggle, will I still receive Skype phone/video calls?   I know this toggle will temporarily disable banners/alerts, as those notifications are actually routed through Notification Center, but calls have a popup dialog of their own.  If not, how can I temporarily disable Skype calls? Do I need to log out?  <answer295534> Skype has a "Do Not Disturb" function.  If you click on the lower right hand corner of your avatar, you can select your status.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qodmP.png" alt="enter image description here"  When you select "Do Not Disturb" you will not receive any notifications from Skype.  <comment373210> Interesting. So then do Skype calls go to voicemail, if set up? <comment373211> Yes.  It will go to voicemail. <comment373213> Thanks for the help.
