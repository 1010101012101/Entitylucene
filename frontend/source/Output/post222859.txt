iCloud Drive Bird Service always running <body> I am having a problem with iCloud Drive. I managed to see progress thankfully with the help of this command:  precodehttp://apple.stackexchange.com/a/151810/165031 /code/pre  It seems like there is an error running every second or even more often.  precode[ERROR]  14.007 [2016-01-09 23:17:13.007] bird.scheduler.Uploader        fs.uploader               BRCFSUploader.m:732 Unable to copy thumbnail at '/.DocumentRevisions-V100/PerUID/501/6c131/com.apple.thumbnails/:501:QLThumbnailAdditionName/thumbnail.jpg' to upload stage: &lt;NSError:0x7fec5e22a330(NSCocoaErrorDomain:260) - {     NSFilePath = "/.DocumentRevisions-V100/PerUID/501/6c131/com.apple.thumbnails/:501:QLThumbnailAdditionName/thumbnail.jpg";     NSUnderlyingError = "&lt;NSError:0x7fec5e248200(NSPOSIXErrorDomain:2) - {\n}&gt;"; /code/pre  The codebird/code process in the codeActivity Monitor/code, which is responsible for the iCloud Drive syncing, is taking up 150 and more percent of the CPU all the time and doesn't stop.  What I tried:  ul liinstalled iCloudStatus, which shows which files are being synced... but the file doesn't show up/li likilled the codebird/code and the codecloudd/code process... will just fire up again/li lideleted code~/Library/Application Support/CloudDocs/code all my files were deleted and newly downloaded but I got the same error/li /ul  What can I do to get rid of this? Thanks for any suggestions.  <answer223558> I got rid of the problem by removing the folder that contained the file over the terminal. Seems like there was something mixed up.  This is how I did it:  ol liWith the help of this command I could figure out what was wrong:  brctl log --wait --shorten/li liI looked into it and saw there was one error always repeating and it always tried to upload it./li liBecause I couldn't find the file via the terminal (because it was never on my disk) I deleted the folder that should have contained the file. It did that with the help of  sudo rm -rf name_of_the_folder/li /ol  I hope that helps someone.  <comment338710> How do you get the folder name? here is an excerp http://pastebin.com/Lsm9wwU6 <comment338956> I don't see any path either in this log. Seems like this private is diguising it. You can try to run the first command with sudo or remove the --shorten parameter. Maybe it gives you the info you seek.
