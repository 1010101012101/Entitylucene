What does the "aapl,panic-info" output from "nvram -p" mean? <body> When I run codenvram -p/code I get the following:  precode$ nvram -p | cut -c1-30 aapl,panic-info %f0%b0;=F%8d%e BootCampHD  %02%01%0c%00%d0A%03 boot-image  %02%01%0c%00%d0A%03 SystemAudioVolume   W /code/pre  The line with codepanic-info/code is actually ~9000 characters long. What does this mean? Should I be worried, as the word 'panic' implies?  <answer37410> The line codepanic-info/code is the details of the last kernel panic registered and stored by the system.  If you do a PRAM (or NVRAM) reset, those details will be removed.  For example, I just ran codenvram -p/code and I had no codepanic-info/code line because I did a PRAM reset since my last kernel panic.  I can't even remember the last time I had a kernel panic.  Hope that clears it up for you.
