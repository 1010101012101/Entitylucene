How to decrease logging level reported in Console? <body> I think my macOS works in some debug mode, but I'm not sure, because when I open emConsole/em, I see a lot of log entries every second, despite not doing much. If I enabled that mode, I don't remember how it was enabled. There are some entries regarding memory allocation, em/em and some other.  Before I didn't see so much logs, unless it's a Sierra thing.  I don't have any extras in codeboot-args/code section when running: codenvram -p/code.  Here is the example:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2PeBx.png" alt="Console macOS logs"  How do I lower the verbosity of my logs? Or such thing is expected?  I'm aware that I can filter the logs by choosing emErrors and Faults/em, but this is not what I'm looking for.  <answer267719> No, reducing verboseness of the macOS logs is not a standard option.  While there may be a Terminal command/flag or a mod GUI app that lets you change the error levels recorded, I'd advise against doing so because if and when you need support/help, the console logs will be one of the places a tech person would review, and if they're truncated then there's less clues for the person investigating an issue.  <answer281404> You can change the system-wide logging settings with codelog(1)/code.  precodesudo log config --mode "level: error" /code/pre  â€¦should limit logging to error-level messages only.  I have not tested this, and I would advise against it.  Rather use the codelog/code command in collaboration with the Console application to filter only the messages you want to see.
