What does `brew man` do? <body> I mean codebrew man/code, not codeman brew/code.  It says:     Fetching: hpricot-0.8.6.gem (100%) Building native extensions.  This   could take a while... Successfully installed hpricot-0.8.6 Fetching:   rdiscount-2.1.8.gem (100%) Building native extensions.  This could   take a while... Successfully installed rdiscount-2.1.8 Fetching:   mustache-1.0.1.gem (100%) Successfully installed mustache-1.0.1   Fetching: ronn-0.7.3.gem (100%) Successfully installed ronn-0.7.3 4   gems installed Writing manpages to /usr/local/share/man/man1   So what have I installed? What does it do?  <answer192619> From Homebrew issue #40735, what would the command "brew man cask" do? (which can be found by simply googling code"brew man"/code)     codebrew man/code generates the Homebrew manpage from markdown, using these gems to do the translation.   <comment229269> What does "Homebrew manpage" mean? Contents of man brew or all the man pages of all the brew packages? Also, what's markdown? <comment229282> @seeker_of_bacon Please do some research on your own and only post questions here which cannot be answered by simply googling (as your second question)
