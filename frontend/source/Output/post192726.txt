Are there any iOS games that involve game theory? <body> The closest I found is Topia World Builder, but it's unclear to me if the predator/prey dynamic is based on game theory or is some generic algorithm. Seems this would be a simple game to implement, so I'm surprised there are many varieties, or anything really, in the App Store.   <comment229441> You have an interesting concept there. Game theory is applicable to most of life's conundrums, but to make it into a game? That's fascinating. <comment229443> Let me know if you're interested to develop something... ;) <comment229448> I'll have to brush up on my Game theory, but I may be interested.
