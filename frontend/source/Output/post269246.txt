Recording video with audio from DAW? <body> I've never done video recording, only a little audio recording with audacity and GarageBand so apologies in advance if my question isn't quite right...  I'm looking at recording video of myself playing guitar and the audio needs to be the output from GarageBand as this provides effects, not the raw audio in to my Mac.   Without asking for product recommendations, is piping the output from a DAW as the audio stream into typical video recording software a normal scenario, a standard feature?  <comment338237> Have you thought about recording the video and audio separately and then combining them in a video-editor?
