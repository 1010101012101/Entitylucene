Enter to open a file or a folder in Macintosh Explorer <body> Is it possible to configure Macintosh Explorer so that pressing kbdENTER/kbd opens a file or a folder (as we can do in Finder)?  <comment189016> Is there any reason you're using Macintosh Explorer specifically? I see it has been discontinued. <comment189102> @StuartH Yes, I am looking for a [File browser with treeview](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/161867/20338). Any idea? <comment189119> I'm not sure if it offers the functionality you're seeking, but possibly Path Finder? http://www.cocoatech.com/pathfinder/ <comment189123> @StuartH Thanks, it doesn't have a treeview :(
