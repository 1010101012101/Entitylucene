How to investigate "Date changed to 1. January 2016"-issue? <body> Yesterday I closed the lid of my laptop, a MacBook Pro (Retina, Mid-2012) - OS X 10.11.6 (El Capitan). No external devices were connected and the fans run down, so I expect it to be asleep.   Before waking it today I connected various devices (charger, thunderbolt-ethernet, mini-dp for the screen, usb-hub in the screen and headphones) to run it in closed-clamshell mode.  To wake it up, I open the lid slightly until I see light on the internal display, then I close it again so that I only use the external screen. When external display showed, it showed the login-screen, so I expect that it may have had a kernel-panic.  When I logged in the applications restarted as after a restart. But, the strangest behaviour was that the date had changed to 1. January 2016.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RTNjN.png" alt="enter image description here"  I changed the date back to 'now' by setting the timeserver to Apple Asia, then back to Apple Europe.  I was not able to find any information online on this combined behaviour. How do I go further to investigate/diagnose these issues?
