devolo cockpit application keeps waking macbook and draining battery <body> Hi I recently installed the devolo powerline cockpit software which basically didn't work so I removed it or so I thought. Since installation and removal mac has suddenly drained all battery power in supposed sleep mode overnight. Looking at console I can see activity logs that suggest some of this application still lingers and is constantly trying to re-start. I assume this almost constant level of the app trying to re-launch is causing my battery drain but how do i stop this or delete whats left of it as i cant find it anywhere on the mac but something seems to be there according to activity logs.  Some of the log is below here, any suggestions much appreciated  precodeMay  5 21:11:49 MARKs-MBP com.apple.xpc.launchd[1] (de.devolo.networkservice): Service only ran for 0 seconds.

Try removing the devolo launch file from  ~/Library/LaunchAgents or ~/Library/LaunchDaemons (or respectfully /System/Library/LaunchAgents or /System/Library/LaunchDaemons) and reboot (there are better ways to do it, but i'm too lazy to write a proper answer). <comment356442> many thanks for your response, have tried that and deleted one file i found and restarted but logs still coming thick and fast. weird <comment356443> Was this the file: /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/de.devolo.networkservice.plist? According to other answers, there are two files: de.devolo.networkservice.plist and de.devolo.networkservice.notify.plist <comment356444> there was only one file and afraid i cant remember which of the two it was but there was defo only one. Other couldn't have got buried somewhere else? <comment356454> Try installing and then removing the devolo cockpit manager, hopefully this time it'll fix it.
