The App Store only opens "Updates" — How to fix? <body> I have an iPad running iOS 9.3.5. When I open the App Store it opens with a blank screen, and “Updates” is the only panel that shows any data.  How can I fix this?  <answer292971> Try this:  ol liDouble-click the strongHome/strong button (press it twice quickly):br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dbtm6.jpg" alt="Home Button"/li liThe strongMultitasking Screen/strong appears. Locate the strongApp Store/strong and drag it off the screen by swiping up on it:br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/c2Mqm.jpg" width="375"/li liPress the strongHome/strong button again./li liRelaunch the strongApp Store/strong./li /ol  <comment369634> I'm not sure what is meant by "home button".  Even so, swiping up on App Store doesn't activate the app store app.  When I open the App Store there is a blank white screen with options at the bottom ("Featured", etc), but the only option that works in "Updates".  How can I get the other options to work?  Thanks. <comment369636> I’ve added a photo of the **Home** button and a screenshot of the **Multitasking Screen**. I hope that helps. <comment369638> Thanks. I thing the multitasking feature only works with Ipad air, mini and pro.  I have neither of these. <comment369641> No, it exists in this form on all devices that support iOS 7 or newer, going back to iPad 2. <comment369643> Ok, now I understand - It worked:::: Thanks so much for your effort and patience... <comment369652> If my Answer resolved your problem I would appreciate if you could Accept it (click the checkmark next to it)
