How to copy a cell formula in Numbers <body> Lets say I have a formula like code(Q7+Q11)÷Q20/code in cell codeO20/code and I wanna copy it to another cell, lets say codeD47/code, is there any key modifier or shortcut to do it without losing the original references of the formula and without rewriting it?  Something like codeCmd+Alt/code emdrag and drop/em?  I am with Numbers 4 on Mac OS Sierra  <answer276035> h1Using the built-in method/h1  As per Apple’s Knowledge Base, Numbers supports strongabsolute references/strong:     You can set row and column references in a formula to be absolute so that you can use the same formula elsewhere in your spreadsheet without the cell references changing, as they would otherwise.   To change your original formula to use absolute references, follow these steps:  ol liDouble-click on the original cell to go into edit mode./li liFor each reference, click on the triangle; then tick both boxes emPreserve Row/em and emPreserve Column./em/li /ol  Or, as an alternative to step 2, you can manually edit the reference to say e. g. code$A$1/code instead of codeA1/code.  The obvious strongdrawbacks/strong of this method are:  ul liThe method basically locks your formula in a mode that makes it hard to reuse the same formula in other places where you actually emwant/em flexible references./li liIf you you want to copy many different original formulas, you need to repeat the method over and over./li /ul  <answer276036> h1Using an AppleScript to emCopy Formulas/em/h1  A more reusable approach would be a simple strongAppleScript that replicates the emCopy/em command/strong but only copies the bare formulas:  precodeon join(cells, delimiter)   set previousDelimiters to AppleScript's text item delimiters   set AppleScript's text item delimiters to delimiter   set resultString to (cells as text)   set AppleScript's text item delimiters to previousDelimiters   return resultString end join  on getSelectedFormulas()   set tab to character id 9   set lf to character id 10    tell application "Numbers"     tell document 1's sheet 1's table 1       tell selection range         set {min, max} to {column 1's address, column -1's address}         set formulaRows to {}         repeat with aRow in rows           set formulaCells to {}           repeat with aCell in aRow's cells min thru max             set formulaCells to formulaCells &amp; (aCell's formula)           end repeat           set formulaRows to formulaRows &amp; ¬             my join(formulaCells, tab)         end repeat         return my join(formulaRows, lf)       end tell     end tell   end tell end getSelectedFormulas  on run()   tell application "Numbers"     set the clipboard to my getSelectedFormulas()   end tell end run /code/pre  (Note: I’m the author of the script; it’s under the ISC open source license.)  This also eliminates the need to modify the original formulas.  h2Binding the script to a keyboard shortcut/h2  In order to bind this script to a keyboard shortcut in Numbers, open Automator.app to create an Automator workflow. Choose the option emService receives no input in Numbers/em, create a single emRun AppleScript/em step and paste the AppleScript code there.  Save the workflow under the name codeCopy Formulas/code, then open emSystem Preferences/em and click on emKeyboard,/em then emKeyboard Shortcuts/em » emServices/em » emNumbers/em » emCopy Formulas./em Configure a keyboard shortcut; I’d recommend kbd⌥⇧⌘C/kbd because you’re probably going to use it often with its counterpart, emPaste and Match Style,/em which already has the shortcut kbd⌥⇧⌘V/kbd.  <comment347365> Many thanks for taking so much time to elaborate these answers @Synoli, I was aware of some of the details but I was expecting something more direct from Numbers, I guess it simply doesn't exist <comment347379> Once the AppleScript is installed, you simply select your cells while in Numbers and press `⌥⇧⌘C` as mentioned. It will also appear as a menu item in _Numbers_ » _Services_ if using the mouse is more your thing. How more »direct« would you want it to be?
