Stream iPhone camera video to a Mac <body> Is there an app that would let me stream the iPhone/iPad camera to my Mac? I need high quality so it can be recorded.   <answer121229> Athome Camera can do this, however it is mainly marketed as a home monitoring application (camera surveillance).  <answer121389> You could try AirServer this app lets you Airplay to show the screen of your IOS device on your Mac an can also record it in the latest version.
