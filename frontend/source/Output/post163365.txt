How do I change my Apple IDâ€™s rescue email if I forgot my security question's answers? <body> I had my rescue email to my old email that I deleted later. Then I realized that I forgot my security passwords and the only way to find it was to send an email to your rescue email. I didn't know what to do since its been a long time since I deleted that email. What should I do?  <answer163366> When you do not know your security questions and have no recovery email access, the best thing to do is to call applecare. You can find the phone numbers in this link.  When you have two-step vertification enabled, apple can't reset your password. Without your recovery code, your apple id will be useless.  <comment191224> What does this have to do with Apple? <comment191226> This question appears to be off-topic because it's not about Apple.
