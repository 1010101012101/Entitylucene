Regain access to Apple ID traded away and 'returned' <body> I was playing CoM (A game on the App Store that saves progress by Game Center), when this guy comes along and asks for an account trade. I agree because his account is awesome. So I trade, and he eventually gives me my Apple ID back and says that he takes the trade back. I try to log on but it said disabled for security reasons. I then panick because I put in a fake birthday for every thing that requires a birthday. I then make a new Apple ID with the same email and find that everything is gone including apps, progress and most importantly, iCloud.  <answer156762> If you do not know your security questions to reset your Apple ID, try the following.  ul liIf you have 3 different security questions and a rescue email address set up with your Apple ID/li /ul  Sign in to My Apple ID and select the "Password and Security" tab to send an email to your rescue email that you set up.  ul liIf you have only 1 security question that you set up, but don't know your password/li /ul  Contact apple support and hopefully someone can assist you farther.

There is nothing you can do to restore this information to a _new_ account. The best thing you can do is try to regain access to your old account. However, if you entered fake information for security questions/birthday, that seems to be unlikely to happen. <comment184390> BTW, the term for what happened is you were 'socially engineered' or 'phished'. You willingly gave all your data to a scammer.
