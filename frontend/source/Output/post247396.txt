Can I make an iPhone ring on cue without making an actual call? <body> The theater company I work with is doing a show this fall in which a key plot point is an iPhone ringing while it's in someone's purse. They really want to make an iPhone ring and not just use a sound cue. But cell reception inside the theater is spotty at best. Is there some way to get an iPhone to ring without making a call to it?  <answer247397> You can connect Your iPhone to WiFi (so that it has access to the internet) and ring via FaceTime.   To change FaceTime ringtone go to strongPreferences/strong - strongNotifications/strong - strongFaceTime/strong.  <answer247400> Two ways to simulate the effect of an iPhone ringing:  ol liSet a timer in the Clock app with the alert sound set to Marimba (the default iOS ringtone). However, this would require knowing exactly how long to wait before the sound plays./li liLoad an MP3 file of the default Marimba ringtone into the Music app and play it via a Bluetooth controller. Slightly more complex than the first option but allows more flexibility in the act./li /ol  Unless there is something theatrically different between these options and an actual phone call to the iPhone, these are the only options I can think of without cell reception or wifi.
