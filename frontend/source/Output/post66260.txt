How to map a static external IP to static internal IP on Apple Airport extreme <body> I am trying to enable external VNC access to a Mac mini on a small network. I have a static IP address (67.41.xxx.xxx) reserved through my internet provider and the Mac mini has a reserved IP 172.16.5.9. How can I setup Apple Airport Extreme through Airport Utility (software v 6.1) to route traffic from the external IP to the internal IP?  Thanks  <answer66265> I use a utility called Port Map to do this. It allows you to manually make the same calls things like Facetime and iChat do to map ports for file transfers, etc. It's free, simple, kid tested, mother approved.  <comment77950> AirPort Utility  Manual Setup  Internet  NAT  Enable default host at: 172.16.5.9 ? <comment78027> good suggestion. thanks.
