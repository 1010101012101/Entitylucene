How to get the 2FA recovery key? <body> Following up on this question, I made sure 2FA was turned on on my iCloud account and wanted to check my previously saved recovery key was still valid. However, I can't see anywhere at appleid.apple.com to generate a new recovery key. Neither do any of the help pages reference it anymore. Account recovery now seems to entail convincing Apple you are the owner of the account through other means. Are recovery keys still used in iCloud 2FA? If they are, where do you get them? If they are not, what would be the logic of abandoning such a useful safeguard?
