How to display standard Linux libraries of OS X in terminal? <body> Platform: OS X: Yosemite 10.10.4; MacbookPro 15" Retina (mid-2015).  I am new to OS X, I want to explore the underlying operating system and it's Linux components especially.  Linux has standard directories, like:  precode/bin, /sbin, /home, /var, /tmp, /root, /usr, /opt, /code/pre  besides possible others.  In the terminal I don't see any of these directories them:  precodeLeons-MacBook-Pro:~ leon$ cd ~ Leons-MacBook-Pro:~ leon$ sudo cd ~ Leons-MacBook-Pro:~ leon$ sudo ls -l total 88 -r--------   1 leon  staff      7 Jul  1 02:34 .CFUserTextEncoding -rw-r--r--@  1 leon  staff  12292 Jul  8 17:06 .DS_Store drwx------  20 leon  staff    680 Jul  8 17:07 .Trash -rw-------   1 leon  staff   4114 Jul  8 14:38 .bash_history drwx------   9 leon  staff    306 Jul  6 02:52 .dropbox drwxr-xr-x   5 leon  staff    170 Jul  1 11:50 .eclipse drwxr-xr-x   5 leon  staff    170 Jul  6 15:49 .p2 -rw-r--r--   1 leon  staff      0 Jul  1 11:45 .pkglist -rw-r--r--   1 leon  staff    979 Jul  4 11:28 .profile -rw-r--r--   1 leon  staff    243 Jul  4 02:07 .profile.macports-saved_2015-07-04_at_03:21:55 -rw-r--r--   1 leon  staff    611 Jul  4 03:21 .profile.macports-saved_2015-07-04_at_11:28:13 drwxr-xr-x   6 leon  staff    204 Jul  4 03:33 .subversion -rw-r--r--   1 leon  staff    691 Jul  4 12:00 .viminfo drwx------   4 leon  staff    136 Jul  4 14:28 Applications drwx------+  7 leon  staff    238 Jul  6 02:52 Desktop drwx------+  6 leon  staff    204 Jul  6 03:11 Documents drwx------+ 48 leon  staff   1632 Jul  8 17:07 Downloads drwx------@  9 leon  staff    306 Jul  6 02:52 Dropbox drwx------@ 51 leon  staff   1734 Jul  8 17:07 Library drwx------+  3 leon  staff    102 Jun 30 19:47 Movies drwx------+  4 leon  staff    136 Jul  8 17:07 Music drwx------+  4 leon  staff    136 Jul  2 15:39 Pictures drwxr-xr-x+  5 leon  staff    170 Jun 30 19:47 Public drwxr-xr-x  32 leon  staff   1088 Jul  2 19:32 llvm Leons-MacBook-Pro:~ leon$  /code/pre  Questions  Regarding terminal contents:  ol liHow can I view these standard directories (provide commands/steps)?/li liShould these directories all appear, or does OS X not include some of them?/li liWhat do all files / directories starting with "."

OS X is very different from Ubuntu or some other Linux distro.  Regarding terminal contents:  ol liThe standard directories are there, but they are in codels //code (i.e. the root of the drive) not in codels ~/code (the home folder of the current user)./li liSome of the directories are different because OS X is UNIX based, but primarily because it's got a lot of custom Apple stuff sitting on top./li liFiles and folders starting with a dot are hidden. They are used be various applications and services, it depends which one you are interested in as to the answer to your question./li /ol  Regarding Kernel version features and abilities:  ol liYou can find the details of your system with codeuname -a/code in the terminal./li liI don't believe it is possible to modify the OS X kernel, I certainly wouldn't attempt to do so, it's unlikely to be something Apple anticipate, and software updates will likely overwrite this./li liI don't know./li /ol  <answer195053> ol liHow can I view these standard directories (provide commands/steps)/li /ol     You view directories by issuing the ls in the root directory:   precodecd / ls -la /code/pre     ol start="2"   liShould these directories all appear, or MacOS doesn't include some of them ?/li   /ol   The directories ultimately don't matter.  It's the application/function  and where it is located that matters.     ol start="3"   liWhat do all files / directories starting with "." (dot) mean: a) what dot means ? b) what are they used for (by what application or   services) ?/li   /ol   The single dot (".") means current directory.  The double dot ("..") means parent directory.  If I wanted to copy something from one directory to the directory I am in, I would use the single dot instead of typing out the directory again.  Example:  precodecp /some/path/on/the/system/foo.bar . /code/pre  If I wanted to copy something that was any number of directories above the one I was in, I would use the notation  precodecp ../../../foo.bar . /code/pre     ol start="4"   liHow to display MacOS Kernel version which is running/li   /ol   The exact same way you would in Linux - with emuname/em  precodeuname -a Darwin Allans-iMac.home 14.3.0 Darwin Kernel Version 14.3.0: Mon Mar 23 11:59:05 PDT 2015; root:xnu-2782.20.48~5/RELEASE_X86_64 x86_64   /code/pre  You can also click on "About this Mac" on the GUI  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yavHH.jpg" alt="About this Mac"     ol start="5"   liCan I upgrade manually Kernel version of MacOS without upgrading whole MacOS?/li   /ol   Apple does not make their kernel freely available, so the short answer is no.  But, how do you update?  Your App Store app will notify you when updates are available for you to install.     ol start="6"   liIn general - what are the main differences of latest MacOS and (preferably refer to) latest Kernel version - from commands and   features point of view ?/li   /ol   If you would like to see the changes from one version to the next, this Wikipedia article is a good place to start     Meaning: what's in MacOS "is missing" and "what extras" it has   compared to standard Linux ?   That's too broad of a question given that "Linux" is only the kernel or core of the OS and "MacOS" used in your context is referring to the whole OS.  It is also too broad because there are too many different distributions of Linux from DSL, Mint, all the way to RedHat and Suse.  strongemOS X is not Linux./em/strong  OS X is based on BSD while Linux is the kernel that was  developed by Linus Torvalds. Linux Distributions like RedHat, Ubuntu, Mint, or Suse are based on the Linux kernel.   Your question is like trying to figure out what is "missing" when comparing Lego to an Erector Set and all of its knock-offs.  It is advisable that you spend some time with Linux and OS X books and videos to gain a better understanding to the two operating systems.  I hope this helps.   <comment232778> For the first part you ls'ed into your home directory( ~).  Do ls -la / <comment232780> Your question is poorly written and way to broad and outside the scope of what is expected on Stackexchange.  You may want to consult http://stackoverflow.com/help/asking for info on how to properly "ask a question." <comment232781> Your question also indicates that you have a very deficient understanding of Linux in general.  This is not a bad thing and I applaud you for wanting to learn more.  Please being your Linux journey by watching this video:  https://youtu.be/_gCwCOhMcog <comment232782> I sorted questions upon 2 topics for more convenient understanding. Is it better now ? <comment232789> Please answer on questions 3 till 6 - who may help. <comment232790> I am going to do my best to answer because I do want to help.  But, please understand, you do need to invest some time and learn OS X and Linux - their structure, how they work, etc. <comment232792> I study Linux for last 3 months, but Linux side of MacOS not yet got. Please advise for good site and / or book about it, as well. <comment232795> Bing "Linux Tutorial"  for Linux and "OS X Tutorial" for the Mac <comment232796> As you have seen, Mac OSX 'hides' these directories from Finder and casual Terminal use. You have to know how to expose these directories to see them in Finder and Terminal. You aren't stupid, nor is anything wrong with your Mac. Just Google a bit more ;) <comment232821> @Leon Kigelman, OS X is not Linux! <comment232828> I thought I might add that there isn't an universally accepted file system standard. Linux had its FHS standard but Linux distributions do not necessarily follow it. Anyways try `man hier` , this will give you a general layout of the file system Darwin expects.
