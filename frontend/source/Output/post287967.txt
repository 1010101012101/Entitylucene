Docker & OSX's guest Windows 10 Pro "doesn't have VT-X/AMD-v enabled. Enabling it in the BIOS is mandatory" <body> I have macOS 10.12.3 and Windows 10 Pro running under Parallels. I try to install Docker to Windows 10. I could not install Docker for Windows rather Docker Toolbox (no idea why) but in installing the Docker Toolbox     "This computer doesn't have VT-X/AMD-v enabled.

Are you interested in getting Docker running directly on the macOS? The VT-X requirement might be windows related and not Docker required on Apple hardware. <comment363701> I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because it's about running Docker inside of WINDOWS (which is running under macOS by pure chance). <comment363737> I cannot see nothing about enabling nested virtualisation on that point, are you running Parallels Desktop 12?
