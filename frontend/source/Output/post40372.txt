How can you customize the keyboard layout / shortcuts? <body> I've recently migrated from Ubuntu to Mac, but one of the features that I'm lacking most is the strongkeyboard layout/strong for alternative languages. I don't like to switch keyboard layouts all the time, yet at the same time I like to write using accents and diacritics, as needed in each language (Romanian, French, German, etc.).   The strongRomanian/strong keyboard layout provided on Linux offers a very nice "compatibility variant", specially for programmers. Basically it's identical to the English one, but holding down the right kbdAlt/kbd (level 3) key gives you the Romanian special characters:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NsMXG.jpg" alt="Romanian keyboard layout provided on Linux"  How can I have a similar functionality?    Can I at least customize it along these lines:  ul likbd⌥/kbd + kbda/kbd » ă/li likbd⌥/kbd + kbds/kbd » ș/li likbd⌥/kbd + kbdt/kbd » ț/li /ul  hr  PS: I am aware of the Accent Menu and it's limitations.  <answer40376> The US Extended layout may suit your needs.  A chart is at  http://homepage.mac.com/thgewecke/diacritics.html  It's very easy to make your own with  http://scripts.sil.org/ukelele  <answer40391> Although it isn't exactly what you asked for, one possible solution is to use the built-in ability to rapidly switch emInput Sources/em (aka keyboard layouts). To make this function useable, you'll need to do a little setup.  Open strongSystem Preferences: Keyboard/strong and select the strongKeyboard Pane/strong. Check the option to emShow Keyboard &amp; Character Viewers in menu bar/em (1), then click on the emInput Sources…/em button (2).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RkK2P.png" alt="image of Keyboard preferences pane"  The strongLanguage and Text/strong preference pane will open to the strongInput Sources/strong tab. Select the input sources (3) you want to access on a regular basis. Fewer is better, remember you can always return to this tab and change your selections. When you've made your choices click on the emKeyboard Shortcuts…/em button (4).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HAKHm.png" alt="image of Language &amp; Text pane Input Sources tab"  The strongKeyboard/strong preferences pane will open to the strongKeyboard Shortcuts/strong tab. Select emKeyboard and Text Input/em from the column on the left (5). Then check the options to enable the keyboard shortcuts to navigate between input sources. (6).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1M1n6.png" alt="image of Keyboard preferences pane Keyboard Shortcuts tab"  If you stay with the default shortcuts, they will conflict with  the default emSpotlight/em shortcuts. Select emSpotlight/em from the column on the left, and either deactivate or change the keyboard shortcut assigned to the Spotlight functions.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/l3RAt.png" alt="image of Keyboard preferences pane Keyboard Shortcuts tab"  Now when you need to type a special character, use the hotkey to select the appropriate emInput Source/em and use Lion's long hold function to bring up the choices for each character.   emI am currently using/em strongRomanian/strong emas my/em Input Source em. I know this because it's displayed in the strongKeyboard and Character Viewers/strong menu item. A long press on kbda/kbd provides:/em  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1VJTx.png" alt="image of Special Key selection and Keyboard &amp; Character menubar item and special character choices"  Once I've typed the Romanian character, I can use the keyboard shortcut to return to the strongU.S./strong input source.  <answer40408> Since you're coming from a Linux background, I think you'd feel right at home with my suggestion of reading about strongDefaultKeyBinding.dict/strong file.  You use strongUkelele/strong as suggested above for the layouts of accented letters and such. But the keyboard bindings comes handy for programmers shortcuts and special keys.  Google up the file name and you'll have many links and tutorials on the subject. One reference link would be Apple's NSResponder Class Reference which lists all possible actions you can perform in any Cocoa applications using custom keybindings.  <comment45689> The main problem with DefaultKeyBinding.dict is that it doesn't work in many cross platform applications or in shell environments. So as you mentioned, basic remapping should probably be done with Ukelele, even though DKB is indispensable for things like defining text editing macros.
