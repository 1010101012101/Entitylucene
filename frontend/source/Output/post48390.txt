How can I rename music videos on my iPhone? <body> I want to find some music videos and rename them, but I can't figure out how to do that?  I am using iPhone 4S - iOS 5.0.1 - a jailbroken phone and using iFile And iFunBox.  <answer48391> If you have jailbroken your iPhone, I would recommend installing openSSH.  I don't know how to locate the files using iFile or iFunbox, but you install openSSH you can log onto your device using a SSH/FTP client, and your movie files should be placed at:  precode/user/media/dcim/ /code/pre  I use WinSCP (http://winscp.net/eng/download.php) to FTP to my iPhone.  <answer98156> I don't believe it is possible to rename the title of the Music video. The workaround would be this (NOTE: This does involve using a paid Cydia package, Bridge ($1.99)):  ul liOpen Cydia and search for "Bridge". Buy it, install it, respring./li liNavigate to code/var/mobile/Media/iTunes_Control/Music/code via iFile (or SSH Client of choice) ul liThis is where your music, music videos and movies are stored on iOS./li /ul/li liTap on the gear icon in the left lower corner, go to File Manager  Search Format and change it to Wildcard if not already selected./li liGo back to File Manager and turn on "Song Titles" if not already on. Press Done in the upper right corner./li liSwipe up to reveal the search field, select "Hierarchy" and type "*.m4v" ul liNOTE: If your video files are not M4V, then you would type their extension in it's place eg. *.AVI or *.MP4./li liThis should search all of the subfolders (F01, F02â€¦) for any video files./li /ul/li liUnfortunately iTunes names them things like "AAWA.mp3", that is why we turned on song titles. It should display the title above the file name for the video./li liOnce you find the file, note it's location in case you mess up the next step:/li liLong press over it and choose "Select"./li liTap the clipboard in the lower right corner and select copy./li liNavigate to code/var/mobile/Documents/Downloads/code and paste the video./li liGo to Bridge on the home screen and navigate to code/var/mobile/Documents/Downloads/code/li liChoose the video file to import, on the info page select "Music Video" and choose a title for it./li liTap import and you should be all set! :-)/li /ul  It is quite a long and convoluted way to rename a video file, but it is possible (sort of!).  <comment55437> hi, thanks for answer | i checked it with both WinSCP and iFunBox and that folder was empty (/user/media/dcim/) but i have two music files in my vedeos area(i got them with celeste bluetooth).i want to transfer them to iTunes And Rename them. also i want to find them (folder location) <comment55441> any other location? <comment55443> any body home? is this area active? no comment, no new answer... <comment55516> hello.... still no help...
