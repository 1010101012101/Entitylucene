How can I download Swift? <body> I've been trying to get my hands on Swift, but I can't seem to find it.  Is it released yet?  If not, when will it be released?  <answer150587> To use Swift, download Xcode 6 and start using it to develop iOS 8 apps.  Mac apps will become available with the release of Yosemite. More resources are available here: https://developer.apple.com/swift/resources/  <answer150591> Just open Xcode 6, click on new project, select single view project (or any of your choice), next screen select Swift as your programming language. See the codeLanguage/code dropdown in the screenshot below. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wlbDh.png" alt="screenshot of New Project in Xcode"  <answer247837> Go to xcode, select new project, then applications(choose the types), click next. Choose options for new project and in language section where it is Objective C by-default, click onto it and select swift. Rest all the steps are same as Objective C project.  Then all you need is o learn the syntax of swift and get your hand dirty.  Also, swift brings you the new feature known as "strongPlayground/strong":- A playground is an interactive Swift coding environment that evaluates each statement and displays results as updates are made, without the need to create a project. You just have to xcode-File-New-Playground, then name of the project. For platform, if you are developing for mobile applications, choose-iOS, for Mac choose OS X and for apple tv select tvOS.  <comment177210> I have Xcode 6 downloaded, but I don't see the option where I'm supposed to select Swift as the language? <comment177242> You need the Xcode 6 meta not the one from the App Store
