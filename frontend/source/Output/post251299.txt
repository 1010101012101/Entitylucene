Boom2  codecom.apple.audio.Boom2Engine:0.context.preventuseridlesleep/code  Uninstall it [your speakers will last longer] or see if there's an update that fixes the issue.  <comment312443> Thank you Tetsujin, but it was fine for long time, i had problem with screen and one of the chips on logic board was supposed to be fixed, guy who was dealing with this does not know what happened also my keyboard back light stopped working he suggested that connector was disconnected i will find out on Monday.
