Since I can't post all of them hence I am sharing those links with you: https://www.reddit.com/r/applehelp/comments/3v3ybd/wiping_data_to_prevent_future_accidental_probing/ https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4490281?tstart=0 <comment305603> I'm assuming your flash is the 15GB drive (disk1)? <comment307621> i understand that but this not allow me format this flash drive
