why does OSX add extra '._<filename>' when I tar a directory? <body> I'd just like to know why if I "tar -czf" a file/directory, osx adds a:  strong._/strong  for each file? I see these when I untar in linux. Or when I work with the uncompressed project in eclipse as it doesn't like them at all. I use 10.7.5.  <answer75996> Those files were always there, but they are invisible in Finder (and most Mac OS applications).  See https://superuser.com/questions/212896/  strongedit/strong    That is: these files contain the extended file attributes ... en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_file_attributes ... and they were created as soon as MacOS gave extended attributes to the files.  So these ._* files were not created for the tar archive.  <answer76077> OS X's tar uses the AppleDouble format to store extended attributes and ACLs. tar and Archive Utility also know how to convert the ._ files back to the native formats, but the ._ files are kept if the archive is extracted on another platform or on a non-HFS volume.  You can usually just tell tar to remove the metadata by setting COPYFILE_DISABLE to some value:  precode$ xattr -l file.jpg com.apple.quarantine: 0002;50d20c48;Tweetbot; $ tar -cf 1.tar file.jpg  $ tar -tf 1.tar  ./._file.jpg file.jpg $ COPYFILE_DISABLE=1 tar -cf 2.tar file.jpg  $ tar -tf 2.tar  file.jpg /code/pre  Information stored as extended attributes:  ul liResource forks (since 10.4) ul liCustom icons set in Finder and the images of Icon\r files/li liMetadata in PSD files/li liScript objects stored in scpt files, AppleScript Editor window state/li /ul/li liInformation about aliases/li liQuarantine status, download URLs/li liSpotlight comments/li liEncoding of files saved with TextEdit/li liCaret position of files saved with TextMate/li liSkim notes/li /ul  You can see ACLs with codels -le/code:  precode$ ls -led /Applications/ drwxrwxr-x@ 146 root  admin  4964 Jun 17 22:53 /Applications/  0: group:everyone deny delete /code/pre  <comment88175> NO they're weren't always there as it was something I was working with previously on ubuntu. I guess that osx adds them upon exploding the compressed file onto the system. which of course I didn't know until I  took a cop back to the platform of origin. What I'd like to know is wh it adds them in the first place <comment88187> These files contain the extended file attributes ... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_file_attributes <comment88200> Thanks. Can't accept unless you make it an answer <comment88332> Great advice on COPYFILE_DISABLE, solved my problems with those nasty ._ files. <comment200996> https://github.com/libarchive/libarchive/commit/7cf625f3e1ff2f376d265465f8f97dd5b8953ef2#commitcomment-9636090 draws attention to `--disable-copyfile`
