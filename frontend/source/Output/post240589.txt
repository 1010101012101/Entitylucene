Crypt-SSLeay on a macbook <body> I'm trying to install Crypt-SSLeay on a macbook and it failed.  I manually downloaded Crypt-SSLeay from cpan and issued:  precode perl Makefile.pl /code/pre  The error is  precodeopenssl-version.c:2:10: fatal error: 'openssl/opensslv.h' file not found #include &lt;openssl/opensslv.h&gt;      ^ 1 error generated. Failed to build and link a simple executable using OpenSSL /code/pre  The file exists and it's located at:  precode /usr/local/opt/openssl/include/openssl /code/pre  How do I go about fixing this, thanks.  <answer240590> You might try the following:  precode$ perl Makefile.PL --incpath /usr/local/opt/openssl/include --libpath /usr/local/opt/openssl/lib /code/pre  as per the codeCrypt-SSLeay/code install docs.  (Note that the above assumes that the OpenSSL libraries, codelibcrypt/code and codelibssl/code, are installed in code/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib/code on your Macbook.)  Hope this helps!  <answer272166> I typed this in:  precodecpanm LWP::Protocol::https /code/pre  And then installed codeCrypt-SSLeay/code using:  precodecpanm Crypt::SSLeay /code/pre  And it worked. When I tried to install codeCrypt::SSLEay/code before codeLWP::Protocol::https/code I got the same error as you originally did.
