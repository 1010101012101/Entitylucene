Read-only HFS+ on Windows 10 with boot camp driver question <body> I've been searching around on the internet for a while trying to answer this question, but I can't get a clear answer for it.  strongBackground info:/strong I'm running El Capitan with a Windows 10 partition on my MBP that I created through Boot Camp. When I ran the boot camp assistant, I made sure the "Download latest support software from apple" box was checked. After that my computer rebooted and I installed Windows onto the newly created partition from a USB drive. I then booted into Windows, where an Installer for the Boot Camp Windows Software popped up. I installed it.  I've read on the internet that the Boot Camp Support Software allows read-only access to the Macintosh HFS+ partition, BUT windows does not recognize the partition, I can't even read from it. Why is this? Is what I read wrong? Or is there a different thing I need to install that's not the software apple put on my Windows Install USB? Or is this feature simply not supported in Windows 10?  I can't figure out why this drive is not accessible to me even though a bunch of places on the internet say that support is included in the Boot Camp Support Software, which I'm fairly sure I installed  strongEDIT/strong: I realize that there are other third party options to get both read and write support for HFS+, but I am specifically looking for an option built in by Apple.  <answer213274> I finally solved it!  This literally took hours out of my day, but I now know what the problem was. It turned out that the drivers actually were installed. by verified this checking for the presence of the following files:  precodeC:\Windows\System32\Drivers\AppleHFS.sys C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\AppleMNT.sys /code/pre  The reason that the drive was unreadable is because they strongwere encrypted with FileVault/strong. I disabled FileVault in OS X, and when I booted into Windows again, the partition was mounted.  There might be a way to use FileVault and Boot Camp together, I'm not sure. I read in a few places, however, that if you enable FileVault emafter/em installing Windows with Boot Camp, you can have your drive encrypted and accessible from windows. em(This is just a hunch however, I'll have to look into it more)/em  <comment257465> I installed the support software that Bootcamp Assistant downloaded and I got read-only access to my Macintosh partition. However, I did need to assign the partition a letter via the Disk Management utility in Windows. <comment257470> I looked into that but my disk management software doesn't allow me assign a letter to the drive, it doesn't even recognize it. Maybe I should try reinstalling the software. <comment257471> Out of interest, was it on windows 10? <comment257513> Yes, it was on Windows 10 <comment319070> This did not help me, I don't use FileVault.
