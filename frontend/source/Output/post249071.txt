Can't seem to install e2fsprogs properly <body> I'm following a tutorial requiring me to use mke2fs. I found that I could install it by brew using codebrew install e2fsprogs/code  Tthis returned the following:   precodeThis formula is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local.  This brew installs several commands which override OS X-provided file system commands.  Generally there are no consequences of this for you. If you build your own software and it requires this formula, you'll need to add to your build variables:      LDFLAGS:  -L/usr/local/opt/e2fsprogs/lib     CPPFLAGS: -I/usr/local/opt/e2fsprogs/include  ==&gt; Summary   /usr/local/Cellar/e2fsprogs/1.42.13: 135 files, 5.0M /code/pre  So i tried using codebrew link e2fsprogs/code which then returned code119 symlinks created/code  But the command mke2fs is still not available. Anyone who can throw me a bone here?  <answer249124> Usually brew executables (except brew itself) are linked to /usr/local/bin/ which is in the PATH already.  Since eme2fsprogs/em executables are also installed to a subsequent sbin folder, force linking them with codebrew ln --force e2fsprogs/code will create a new folder /usr/local/sbin which contains the links to the sbins.  This new folder is strongnot/strong in the PATH. Simply add or extend an already existing  line   precodeexport PATH=/usr/local/sbin:$PATH /code/pre  in ~/.bash_profile.  To update PATH in your current Terminal session immediately, simply enter:  precodesource ~/.bash_profile /code/pre  Or close your Terminal window and open a new one.  <comment308825> How does your PATH look like? And what does `ls -l /usr/local/bin/*e2f*` return? <comment308857> since its keg-only you may need to run brew link -force to really create the symlinks (at least this was so on my maschine - with only brew link it complained about not doing it because of keg-only). what od you get when you enter `which mke2fs` in your terminal
