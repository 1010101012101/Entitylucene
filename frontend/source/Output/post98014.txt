Disabling highlighting of menu items when using a keyboard shortcut <body> Whenever I use a keyboard shortcut that is accessible using the menu bar, the related item gets highlighted in blue for less than a second - which I find visually annoying.  Can one disable that effect?  <comment115078> A similar question at Super User: http://superuser.com/questions/439951 <comment115186> Thank you, changing the selection color was an acceptable solution for me!
