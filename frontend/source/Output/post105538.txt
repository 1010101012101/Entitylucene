How to take advantage of Intel's SpeedStep technology <body> I've never formerly know about Intel's emSpeedStep/em capabilities in my Mac(Book Pro 5,1) until the last few days. And let me say that the possibility to make the battery last longer is good enough to give it a try.  By the way, the "original" codeIntelEnhancedSpeedStep.kext/code (1.4.9) seems to be made for working only on a 32bit kernel; while I use - and want to - the 64bit one.  hr  N.B.: I'm talking about codeOS X 10.6/code(code.8/code a.k.a. emSnow Leopard/em).  hr  So I tried to pick up its natural successor: codeVoodooPowerMini.kext/code (both 1.2.49 and 1.2.7).  I haven't found any documentation about its usage, so I have used to treat it as any kext (codechown/code to root:wheel and codechmod/code to 755) but when I try to install that kext with codekextload/code, the whole system freezes (and the cursor vanish) leaving me with only the possibility to force the shutdown.  I've also tried to make some test with codekextutil/code and strongeverything/strong appears to be fine.  Thanks in advance for any suggestion/help/hint/guide/tutorial that you can provide!
