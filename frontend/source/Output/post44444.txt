How does File Vault 2 handle a Windows 7 virtual machine <body> Thinking about using File Vault 2 on 2010 macbook air.  I have a windows 7 virtual machine using vm fusionware that is 13 gb large.  What/how will File Vault 2 handle this large space?  <answer44445> strongFilevault 2 encryption happens on the fly/strong while the system is running.  It does not affect a specific process or application. However, it does affect the I/O performance to the disk. Because Virtual Machines have a lot of read/write operations to the hard drive, the Machine will start slower when loading from the disk.  I have 15GB Virtual Box image for Ubuntu 11.10. It runs very good because my CPU supports the strongNew AES Instructions for accelerated encryption/strong which Filevault 2 makes use of.  emIn answer to your question:/em  ul liAs long as you still have 10-15% of total free space on your hard disk, Filevault 2 will handle any large VM./li liBut, I've looked up the Intel processors used in the 2010 Macbook air models. Unfortunately, none of them support the accelerated encryption!  ul liBecause your Macbook Air is not very powerful, I do not recommend using VMs in Filevault 2, or Filevault 2 at all, if you don't really need it./li liEnabling Filvault 2 will cause large drops in reading/writing speeds to your flash drive without accelerated encryption./li /ul/li /ul  Also see:  ul liIntelÂ® Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)/li liFilevault 2/li /ul
