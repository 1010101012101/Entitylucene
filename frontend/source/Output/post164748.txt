How to convert a DVD to ISO? <body> On Mac OSX 10.9, how do you convert a DVD into an ISO that I can use with players such as VLC.  I wish to achieve this without buying a program.   Steps I have tried:  ol liDownloading Mac app Burn. It lets you select a source and save it as a DVD. However, when I do this, the DVD seems to be corrupt: DVDplayer can't load it properly. VLC can load it, but I only if I select the option to bypass the menus (otherwise it can't load it)./li liUsing the command line  precodesudo diskutil unmount /dev/disk1 dd if=/dev/disk1 of=~/myCD.iso bs=2048 conv=sync,notrunc /code/pre  This makes the ISO, but it's the same problem as (1) above/li liUsing the Command Line  precodehdiutil makehybrid -iso -joliet -o Image.iso /input_path /code/pre  This gives the error message: makehybrid failed - No such file or directory/li liUsing Disk Utility.  You can use Disk utility to create an image, but it only seems to be a code.dmg/code file./li /ol  Ideally, I'd like a solution that does it in one go (i.e. so I don't have to convert the code.dmg/code to code.iso/code) as I have 90+ discs I want to convert.  <answer164754> I use MacTheRipper to copy DVD and Handbrake convert to suitable formats for viewing on iPad etc. I do not know how it would handle copy protection.  <answer164817> In Disk Utility  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ot7PQ.png" alt="enter image description here"  Then rename resulted .cdr file to .iso  Should work with VLC and Windows too  <answer205008> You can see https://superuser.com/questions/85987/mac-os-x-best-way-to-make-an-iso-from-a-cd-or-dvd for the answers.  The answer I posted there was:  ol licodediskutil list/code/li licodediskutil unmount /dev/disk1/code/li licodedd if=/dev/disk1 of=DiscImage01.iso/code/li licodediskutil eject /dev/disk1/code/li /ol  see the page there for more explanation.  You just have to see what the drive is for your DVD drive, such as codedisk1/code, codedisk2/code, or codedisk3/code by using command line 1 above, and adjust the other command lines accordingly.  <comment247215> See #2 in the question (the OP already tried that). `dd` will not work for your usual movie DVD. <comment247271> so the OP is more concerned with copy protection, rather than how to make an ISO... <comment299520> Related: http://superuser.com/q/85987/507566
