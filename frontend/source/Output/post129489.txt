How do I delete Java application preferences? <body> I am running Jabref v2.10 on Mac OS X 10.9.2. After changing some parts of the configuration file manually, I seem to have broken the preferences and now it fails to start. The application stores the application preferences using the java.util.prefs library. Is there a way I can delete java's stored preferences in Mac? (E.g., in linux, I would just delete the ~/.java folder)  <answer129493> From Apple Developer Connection:     The preferences files generated by the Preferences API are named com.apple.java.util.prefs. The userâ€™s preferences file is stored in their home directory (~/Library/Preferences/). The system preferences are stored in  /Library/Preferences/ and are only persisted to disk if the user is an administrator.   I do not know if you can simply delete them though.  <comment151611> I had already tried deleting java, jabref specific files in ~/Library, but the problem had persisted. Apparently you need to restart your computer for changes to take place. (Seriously Oracle?) Anyways, that solves my problem <comment151616> Good to know. :) <comment339818> @kourbou I tried to delete this file, and reboot, but preferences are still present. Maybe I miss something?
