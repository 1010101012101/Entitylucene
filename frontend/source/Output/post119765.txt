TextMate auto-indents new line when starting to type <body> I'm using TextMate 2.0 alpha to write some SASS and HAML.  Say I have this code:  precodeh2   font-size: 20px   margin-bottom: 20px   color: #777 /code/pre  When I add a new line after the last key-value pair (codecolor: #777/code), the cursor in the new line auto-indents so that it starts directly under the letter codec/code. That's alright.  But when I want to add another block, such as codeh3/code, I don't want this indentation, so I press kbdENTER/kbd again and then kbdBACKSPACE/kbd, so that the cursor jumps to the beginning of a new line. However, when I start typing, TextMate auto-indents again, which is very annoying:  precodeh2   font-size: 20px   margin-bottom: 20px   color: #777  |&lt;- start typing here...   |&lt;- ...TextMate adds indentation. /code/pre  Likewise, when I added the new block and want to add the first key-value pair, I manually indent by pressing kbdTAB/kbd in the new line, start typing, but now TextMate removes the indentation:  precodeh3   |&lt;- start typing here... |&lt;- ...TextMate removes indentation. /code/pre  To sum up, TextMate seems to always apply the indentation of the previous line when I start typing.  P.S.: I use indentation using spaces (the "2 soft tabs" setting in TextMate).
