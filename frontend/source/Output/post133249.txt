Screenshot file much larger dimensionally than original <body> So I take a screenshot of an area with kbdCommand/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbd4/kbd but when I open the screenshot file in Paint X, the image's dimensions are far larger than the original area.  Is there any way to take a screenshot that looks exactly like the taken part of the screen?  <answer133255> Screenshots taken on a Retina display will be twice the size as screenshots taken on a non-Retina display.  Most software such as Preview will compensate for this, however I'm unfamiliar with Paint X and doubt it is correctly showing the image rather than the image being 'wrong'. Try using software optimised for a Retina display.   If you want take screenshots for non-Retina displays, you can use RetinaCapture. Note that these screenshots at 100% on Retina displays in software optimised for Retina will be smaller than real size.  <comment157882> Are you perhaps on a Retina MacBookPro and the screenshot is exactly twice as big in each dimension? <comment157883> Yes, retina and I think yes twice.. @AlanShutko <comment157884> What setting is your display in the system preferencs? Would you object to an automated solution to resize the snaps or recommendation for another tool that makes it easy? <comment157885> just wondering what are your settings in Paint X. Also does it open as large in any other programs like Preview? <comment157886> It is in the 4th position not the smallest but the one before that. I would really if all my taken screenshots were like 50% smaller by default. @bmike <comment157887> @Buscar웃 100% in paint x and in preview it automatically resizes it to fit the window. <comment157892> Exactly…the screenshots are exactly the same size as the display. The problem is with Paint X. <comment157894> When I open the taken screenshot with browser it is still double the size so I really need to resize them. <comment157895> @KorayTugay: Open it in Preview, then from the View menu choose "Actual Size" (shortcut: kbdCommand/kbd-kbd0/kbd), and see what happens. <comment157896> @Koray Added link to suitable app
