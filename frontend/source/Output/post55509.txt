Xcode will open tiny window but not IDE? <body> Sometimes I quit Xcode with only a tiny window I was editing something else in. Now whenever I open my project again it will open the window but not the IDE. Is there any way to physically open the IDE so I can work on my project again?  <answer57272> Xcode will usually do this if this style of window is the last to be closed. If this is the case the your window looks like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/B3HcV.png" alt="enter image description here"  Then it can be fixed simply by doing the following:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nCtPM.png" alt="enter image description here"  And finally select what side bars you want to be visible:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ofUyA.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment63719> If you can provide a screenshot, it would be way easier to understand what's going on.
