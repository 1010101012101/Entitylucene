Cannot create Apple ID either from iOS of website - An unknown error has occurred <body> I'm trying to create an Apple ID from a used iPhone 5 that I have purchased but it's failing.  After failing on the iPhone I tried to create one from the website but I'm always getting an "An unknown error has occurred"  No clue on how to solve it.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jbYdp.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment360403> First of all, you should _never_ show a verification code publicly. Did it happened only recently (today) or have you tried it since some time? <comment360404> OK. Well the verification code changed all the times I tried to create so I didn't think it was a problem. I have tried for the past hour and a half and it's always failing. <comment360409> Ok, about the verification code, it's just that Apple says so (for security apparently). And I asked that because it might have been a system down on Apple side, but it [doesn't seems](https://www.apple.com/support/systemstatus/) to be any issue there... <comment360410> Could the phone be stolen? <comment360411> I don't think that could lead to this issue, because you can create an Apple ID from any device (but I'm not 100% sure) <comment360570> Have you tried clearing your Mac's Safari cache?  In Safari go to `Preferences - Privacy - Manage Website Data` and search for `apple`.  Highlight anything showing and hit `Remove`.  Restart Safari and try again.  Does that help? <comment360576> I think it was an Apple server problem even though the status page was showing the server as active. Managed to create the ID the next day. <comment366782> I have exactly the same error. Tried it in Safari and Chrome on the Mac and again with Safari on my iPhone with the same result. I hope tomorrow it will just work like @FabrizioMazzoni mentioned.
