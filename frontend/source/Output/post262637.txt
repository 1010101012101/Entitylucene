Mail refuses to open after adding Gmail to Internet Accounts <body> I would like to add my Gmail account to Internet Accounts so that I can use Mail, iCal and Address Book with the service.  However, as soon as I add my Gmail to Internet Accounts, Mail stops working, giving a ‘Mail quit unexpectedly’ error message. If I remove the Gmail account from Internet Accounts, Mail works again.  Does anyone know if there is a way of making this work?  macOS Sierra 10.12.1, Mail 10.1
