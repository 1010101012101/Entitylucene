Can't login to App Store for Yosemite installation <body> I'm trying to install Yosemite on my MacBook Pro. I erased disk and now I'm trying to install new system using Internet Recovery. But the problem is, when I choose 'Reinstall macOS' option i must log into my App Store account. I type my Apple ID and password but after then i get error which says that App Store is not available and i should try again later.  How can I go with this installation?  <comment336741> It may benefit you to make a bootable disk with the Yosemite installer on it.
