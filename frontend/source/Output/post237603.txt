What is the purpose of lock the login keychain? <body> This is what I mean:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ovmCW.png" alt="enter image description here"  When I try to lock above keychain I get a lot of pop alerts similar to this:  codeaccountsd wants to use the login keychain/code, code"safari wants to use the login keychain"/code and so on. If such thing produces a lot of annoying alerts, so strongwhat is the reason to lock login keychain/strong? strongShould it be unlocked usually?/strong  <comment291088> It's normal unlocked whilst that user is using it... otherwise each access requires authority.
