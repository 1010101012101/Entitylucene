Is there a quick way to delete Foldered bookmarks directly from Safari bookmark bar? <body> I like to group my bookmarks into Folders in the Bookmark Bar.  But I cannot find an easy way to delete these bookmarks!  The only way I know to do this is to go to strongShow All Bookmarks/strong, then browse down to the shortcut and select it and delete it - this totally gets in the way of workflow.  Is there any way to delete a strongFoldered/strong bookmark strongfrom the bookmark bar/strong?!  NB - I am not talking about standalone bookmarks, deleting those is easy and intuitive.  <answer22043> Using Open-Book-Icon probably is the easiest way to delete Safari folded bookmark  <answer22048> We're talking about the Bookmarks Bar in Safari, right?  Hold down the Command key and drag it offâ€”poof, disappears.   Same thing with Finder toolbar (plus you can add anything you like to Finder Toolbar by holding down Command key while you drag it into place.)  <answer22052> Since it's a folder, hold down the Command and Option keys, then drag the folder off the Bookmarks Bar. You'll get a confirmation dialog saying "Are you sure?" Just click the Delete Folder button in the dialog.  Holding the Command and Control keys keys down gets you a contextual menu that allows you to edit the name of the folder, edit its contents (jumps you to the Bookmarks window to do that), delete it, copy it, and a few other things.  <answer116649> Hit kbdoption/kbd+kbdcommand/kbd+kbdB/kbd. It will open a bookmark editor; it's very easy to delete anything within a folder from there.  <answer193399> Just delete the whole safari folder in the library directory   <comment24331> Hi Serith - sorry, my question was badly worded - I've amended it now. I am looking to delete bookmarks within folders in the bookmarks bar - any ideas? <comment24332> Your suggestions only work for non-Foldered bookmarks... <comment24338> Sorry - I am talking about bookmarks within **folders** in the bookmarks bar. Command Drag just opens the bookmark in a new tab! <comment24339> This is helpful - and a command I didn't know, and certainly speeds up the workflow. But - is there an even better way - I want to delete items within the folder, not the whole folder. (Best answer so far though!) :-) <comment24340> Also, just noticed that right clicking the folder gives you the same menu. <comment136508> I don't think it's possible. Foldered bookmarks are presented as options of a contextual menu (think about a folder in a file manager and the contextual menu you get when right clicking on it), so either left or right click executes/opens the bookmarks (drags are nulled out and equal a click). You can see the same behavior in other apps which have some sort of Bookmarks Bar. <comment230508> Elephant gun / House fly? The OP wanted to delete one bookmark, quickly, not the whole lot, slowly.
