enabling virtual machine Guest Additions on a Mac host and Mac guest <body> I want to enable codeShared folders/code on VirtualBox. I went to codeDevices tab/code and clicked - codeInsert guest additions CD image/code. Nothing happened. This is an image of my Storage tab in Settings of Virtual box:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/f3zJ0.png" alt="enter image description here"  I previously got this message, that instructed me to go to codeInsert guest additions CD image/code:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BXmvt.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer238837> I'll quote a previous answer of mine:     From Virtualbox Manual : Chapter 14:            strong14.2. Known Issues/strongbr     Mac OS X guests:br     VirtualBox does not provide Guest Additions for Mac OS X at this time         [snip]      From the content of this, I wouldn't hold out for such support in VirtualBox any time soon.   The situation really has not changed since then.  There is some discussion of a workaround involving the built in OS X sharing functionality and configuring your network setup to work, but nothing well defined.   <answer253016> For now, you can use codemkisofs -o my.iso/code and insert the iso as a virtual CD-ROM to share files from the host to the Virtual Machine directly, otherwise Cloud sharing tools are always an option, as well.  <answer284819> h2Workaround: creating a code*.iso/code/h2  em(from here)/em br  Create a code*.iso/code and insert this "optical drive".  ul liTo create the file, open terminal and navigate to the folder you want to pack; then run: br codehdiutil makehybrid -iso -udf -udf-volume-name NAME_OF_ISO -o ./OUTPUT_FILE_NAME.iso ./FOLDER_TO_PACK//code br where obviously you have to choose codeNAME_OF_ISO/code (pretty much irrelevant), codeOUTPUT_FILE_NAME.iso/code and specify the folder codeFOLDER_TO_PACK/code/li liThen insert the created file in your guest br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JZQp4.jpg" alt="enter image description here"/li /ul  <answer288026> You can copy the guest additions iso from your machine.     First locate VirtualBox in the Application folder, right-click it and select show package contents. Then browse to Contents/MacOS/VBoxGuestAdditions.iso. Copy it to a location that accessible when browsing for files.   After that, you can insert the device by clicking Devices  Optical Drives  Choose disk image... and then choose your copied iso file.  Then you can run your iso from within your vm and install the guest additions.  <comment292969> daamn, so no shared folders for Macs :( <comment313309> Unfortunate, but I used Dropbox as a work-around which works fine. You can either use the same account on both your host and guest, or just set up a shared folder from one account to another. You could also use BitTorrent sync or something else. <comment359176> I usually just use a USB key.
