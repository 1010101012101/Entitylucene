How to un-hide a file that has been hidden on Mac OS 8? <body> I have a copy of an old folder holding a file that has been hidden on Mac OS 8 or 9 (using resedit, if my memory isn't failing). Is there an easy way to un-hide it in OS X?  <answer50444> If you have Xcode installed you can try the SetFile command. The command below should unhide the hidden file.  precodeSetFile -a v hiddenFilename /code/pre  <answer50523> If you remember the location you saved the file to you can do the following.  Open the terminal and enter these commands.  (show all hidden files)  precodedefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool true /code/pre  (restart Finder)  precodekillall Finder /code/pre  Make what ever modifications you need to, and when your done enter these.  (re-hide hidden files)  precodedefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool false /code/pre  (restart Finder again)  precodekillall Finder /code/pre
