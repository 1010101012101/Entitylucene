Is it possible to have 2 wireless interfaces and have each interface connect to a different VPN over a MacPro? <body> Is it possible to have 2 wireless interfaces and have each interface connect to a different VPN over a MacPro?  Basically, I have a MacPro with 2 wireless interfaces. I connected to both wireless networks, and would like each network interface to be able to VPN to 2 different VPNs.  I was wondering if that was even possible. Currently, when I connect to one wireless network via Cisco IPSec VPN it forces all traffic through that one interface. And was wondering if I had a 2nd wireless interface would I be able to connect to the network to a different VPN.  <answer146577> The problem of Cisco VPN rules forcing all traffic through the VPN is a long-standing pain in the neck.
