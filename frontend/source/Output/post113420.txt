MacBook Pro will boot only after a SMC reset <body> I replaced the hard drive in my MacBook Pro (mid-2010) with a SSD one. I installed Mac OS X 10.9. At first the installer wasn't able to find the new SSD drive, because of a error: "SerialATAPI device reconfiguration did not complete successfully."  Following a friend's advice I reset the SMC, and the installer worked perfectly.  Now I have a working system, but every time I boot it I have to do a SMC reset, otherwise the system is not booting, and I see a blinking folder instead of the usual Apple.  That means that: "no bootable device has been found" http://support.apple.com/kb/ht2674  Is there anyway to have my system booting without a SMC reset before every boot?  I tried many times with a NVRAM reset, but it didn't help. Also this answer did not help: MacBook Pro Mid 2009 does not boot without resetting system management control (SMC)  <comment192906> Good question. You might consider adding info on SSD and particular setup for other o take clues and maybe just share that information.
