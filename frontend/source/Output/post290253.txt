Removing smart card login from my Mac <body> I've seen a lot of questions about adding a smart card login to a Mac, but my problem is the opposite.   I have a company smart card that I use on my personal computer sometimes for checking webmail and such. However, at some point I must have done some Keychain stuff with it inserted into the USB reader, because ever since it requires me to insert the smart card and enter its pin in order to unlock my lock screen or to approve software installs and updates.   strongNote:/strong I strongcan/strong Switch Users and login normally to those accounts.  I don't want to mess up my keychain, so I'm hoping someone can tell me what I need to do to bring things back to normal so I can manage my personal computer with just my personal credentials.  This is on Mac OSX Sierra 10.12.5  <comment366449> Paul, it may be worth you [editing](https://apple.stackexchange.com/posts/290253/edit) your question to include the version of macOS you're running. <comment366497> @Monomeeth done, thanks for the suggestion
