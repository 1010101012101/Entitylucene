How to manage software that isn't in the App Store? <body> I'm a Linux sysadmin. I naturally try to apply Linux-y solutions to Mac problems. One problem I'm currently having is managing software on end-user laptops at scale, when the software I want to add is not available in the App store.  Which seems to be most/all of the software I need to manage or install.  ul liBrowsers: Firefox, Chrome, etc. Not in App store/li liVPN clients: Tunnelblick, Viscosity/li liInternally managed Antivirus software/li /ul  etc.  What is the "Apple Way" to manage software across an organization when that software is not available in the App Store?  <comment357704> Haven't used it myself so not going to post this as an answer as I can't provide specifics, but it looks like [Apple Remote Desktop](https://www.apple.com/remotedesktop/) is their official solution... <comment357839> ARD can do this and there are also commercial, 3rd party, applications that can manage Macs in an enterprise and do what you need. <comment357955> Maybe I'm not understanding something, ot maybe I'm just asking the wrong question. I don't think I want a "remote desktop" solution, unless ARD does something above and beyond just logging in to mac computers remotely. I want a way to image, re-image, install, and provision laptops, as well as remote install and similar. Without having to log on to a desktop.
