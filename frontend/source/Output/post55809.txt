Swap right command with right alt/option on external bluetooth keyboard <body> I can swap/remap (only) the right command with right alt using Keyremap4macbook for the built in Macbook keyboard, but would the same be possible for the Apple's external Bluetooth keyboard?  <answer55850> It seems to work at least on my Apple Wireless Keyboard. KeyRemap4MacBook should work with most external keyboards that don't have their own drivers.  <comment64112> Great! Thank you.
