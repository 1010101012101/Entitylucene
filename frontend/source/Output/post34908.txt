How to refresh iCloud after some changes in iTunes <body> I use iCloud to sync music files. On my Mac, I changed some song information such as genre or artist name. How can I sync the changes on my Mac's iTunes with iCloud so that all my iPad and iPhone iTunes have the same change?   <answer34939> As far as I know these changes should be applied automatically. If not, try Store - "Update iTunes Match" to apply the changes. You can also use "Add to iCloud" for songs which haven't been matched before.  <comment39811> Related: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/31452/do-i-have-to-explicitly-update-itunes-match-after-adding-new-tracks-to-my-librar
