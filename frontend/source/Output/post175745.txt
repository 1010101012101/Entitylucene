Remove partition and restore the space without erasing <body> Time ago I split  the hard drive (500gb) in two partitions (250 each), now I don't need them anymore, so I have first erased successfully one partition and now I have still the second one (Mac HD 2)  See the image attached  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7tLZW.png" alt="enter image description here"  What I need now is to reapply the 250 gb I have gained from deleting to the Mac HD2, how is it possible? I am in the situation that I don't want erase it but I need the 250 gb left there.  <answer175747> Disk utility can't resize the last partition on a drive. One way would be to use GParted to move the partition and then resize it.  ol liBoot the Mac with a Ubuntu Live CD./li liRun GParted and move the second partition to the beginning of the free space;/li liReboot to Mac OS X./li liVerify and repair the external disk with Disk Utility. It found a minor error on the volume header of the second partition./li liResize the second partition to the end of free space./li /ol  In your case it's a bit easier, since you're only occupying half of the drive.  ol liCreate a new partition in the empty space/li liClone the second partition to the first one/li liDelete the 2nd partition/li liResize the 1st partition/li /ol  <comment207355> I have a problem cloning the second partition to the first one, here the screenshot http://it.tinypic.com/view.php?pic=2q20cd0&s=8#.VPtcY4GG8X0 . It says that the source volume is for writing and reading and it can not be desactivated that's why it can not be copied in block <comment207363> Can you not simply install OS X on the first partition and then use the Migration Assistant that appears at the end of the installation process to transfer everything across from the second partition? Then you can follow steps 3 and 4 that Kevin mentioned above, deleting the second partition and then resizing the first to use the whole drive. <comment207385> Is it the drive you boot from? If yes, boot from another drive , internet recovery, usb drive, anything will do
