Dual booting OS X from debian <body> I've uninstalled OS X a few month back, and installed just a debian partition, and for the most part my experience has been great, but for various reasons I need an OS X (or I guess macOS now) partition again so I thought I'd stop by here to: check if I can even boot in recovery mode; find out how to repartition my computer; find out about any hurdles I may come across in the process. I know most people come at dual booting from the other direction, and was wondering if anyone here has come from linux to macOS, thanks!
