How to prevent Safari Technology Preview opening default Safari on launch? <body> After selecting Safari Technology Preview as default browser it now also launches macOS's default version of Safari at the same time on launch. Is there a way to prevent this?   <comment345879> This does not happen for me. Do you have any scripts bound to a web browser launching? <comment345880> Thank you @BallpointBen - Is there somewhere to check? Turning Extensions off doesn't seem to make any difference.
