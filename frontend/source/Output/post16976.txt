What's a good SSH tunneling client for OS X? <body> I've been using SSH Tunnel manager to easily set up and stop port tunneling over SSH to various servers at my company. That saved me the pain of opening up a new terminal window which will hang out there just for the sake of having a tunnel open.  This worked great (well , sort of) but SSH Tunnel Manager is a PowerPC application. With Lion, it is not supported any more.  What is a good replacement?  Cheers, Boaz  <answer16983> SSHTunnel is a free, cocoa-based UI for SSH tunnel management. Works on 10.5 and up. It hasn't been updated in a while but the code that's there is reasonably stable. It's worked well for me in the past.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dB2M3.png" alt="SSHTunnel"  <answer22342> SSH Tunnel Manager is now in the Mac App Store!  So, you can run it on Lion.  <answer22366> I am using iSSH in Lion, which is a front-end application to the command line application “ssh”. It provides a quick and easy way to start an SSH connection to a remote computer.  <answer22380> You could also check out Meerkat.  <answer85977> I found Coccinellida, it works on Lion but it's new and a bit buggy : /  <answer86951> iSSH can not remember my password. Coccinellida can save password. But it freezed my Mountain Lion sometimes ...  Shimo is good, but it IS commercial.  <answer99623> TunnelerX is simple and easy to use, focused on SSH SOCKS proxy. It doesn't exactly cover the requirement to manage several servers, as you can only add one server, although, it's usually enough for people looking to use an external box as proxy. It works fine under Mountain Lion.  <answer140185> Try Secure Pipes: http://www.opoet.com It's free software and I'm looking to get more people using it.  <answer158572> Why not just use an SSH Tunnel via OSX's built in Terminal?...  strongLaunch an SSH tunnel/strong  To initiate your SSH tunnel, simply open Mac OSX Terminal.app and connect to your remote server via SSH with the following flags:  precodessh -D 8080 -C -N username@example.com /code/pre  This will launch our SSH tunnel on port 8080 and route all traffic (securely) through the server at example.com.  strongBrowse the Web/strong   Now, let’s start browsing the web using with your new SSH Tunnel (Chrome):  ul liOpen Google Chrome/li liSelect ‘Chrome’ up the top left/li liSelect ‘Preferences’/li liSelect ‘Show advanced settings…’/li liSelect ‘Change proxy settings…’/li liSelect ‘SOCKS Proxy’/li liEnter ’127.0.0.1′/li liEnter port ’8080′/li liSave changes by selecting ‘OK’/li /ul  <answer214352> SSH Tunnel baked by Codinn is a tunnel manager that intuitive and easy to use:  ol liSupport local, remote and dynamic port forwarding/li liBesides ordinary SOCKS 5 proxy, the dynamic port forwarding provides HTTP/HTTPS proxy/li liAutomatically reconnect after disconnected by errors or waking up from sleep/li liTightly integrated with OS X Keychain/li liSupport OpenSSH multi-factor authentication, as well as Google Authenticator and Authy for two-step verification/li liRFC4716, PKCS#8 and PEM key formats are supported, compatible with OpenSSH and Dropbear/li liAble to tuning SSH's advanced options/li liSmart grouping/li liOS X 10.11/10.10/10.9 are all officially supported (for older OS X 10.7 and 10.8, you can download legacy version from here SSH Tunnel for OS X 10.7/10.8)./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QSzdu.jpg" alt="SSH Tunnel"  <answer214945> SSH Tunnel Manager is still alive and supported.  Sorry about the delay though, it is not compatible with El Capitan.  http://projects.tynsoe.org/stm/  <answer285750> I strongly recommend using sshuttle. It's very handy.  <comment23827> Has this been tested under Lion? <comment23829> I haven't tried it yet. <comment24879> Had a chance to try it today. Yes, it still works for me in Lion (10.6.0). <comment30367> Meerkat is giving me problems under Lion. <comment30369> @Ian 10.6.0 isn't Lion - it's Snow Leopard. <comment30376> @CajunLuke Typo. Caught too late to edit the comment. 10.7.0 was what I used. <comment30381> @Ian I see - my apologies. <comment89443> iSSH aleays asks for a password so it doesn't work with SSH keys. <comment89444> It doesn't work on OS X 10.8.x <comment89445> Commercial and broken. <comment89956> Unreliable on 10.8, works only sometimes. <comment108247> It doesn't support local redirection for ports  1024 because that requires root privileges and the app doesn't support that yet :( <comment165213> Welcome to Ask Different! Please see the help center regarding [self-promotion](http://apple.stackexchange.com/help/behavior). <comment186128> Secure Pipes worked for me after creating ssh symlink in a place it was trying to use - `sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/ssh /usr/bin/ssh`. I'm on OS X 10.9.5. Good thing is ability to edit `UUID.ssh_config` file in `~/Library/Application Support/Secure Pipes` directory. I was able to enable Kerberos auth this way. The only thing I wish the config would not be overwritten each time I restart the program (worked around by `sudo chown root UUID.ssh_config`). <comment252979> The question is specifically how to avoid doing all that, because it's annoying when you have to do it frequently. <comment268226> Thanks for that trial. `ps aux | grep ssh` has nothing. How didi you start the tunnel? <comment268243> @hbrls Since SSH Tunnel is based on an excellent SSH library - [libssh](https://libssh.org) :) BTW, we also have open-sourced our core component [SSHKitCore](https://github.com/codinn/SSHKitCore), which is based on libssh. <comment287985> Secure Pipes works well (At least for local forwards) in El Capitan. <comment300810> Not available in the Australian app store $#%! <comment304092> I get "Not available in the US store" (OS X 10.11.5) <comment322044> Cool utility! Works flawless on macOS Sierra. <comment354459> Just bought this paid app and love it. 63 5-star reviews (counting all versions of the app) on the Apple Mac App Store. It gorgeous and intuitive, very Mac-specific solution, and a good way to manage tunnels so I don't have to keep track of scripts and ensure they run at boot, etc...  And BTW, using this. I was able to create a tunnel to get around CyberDuck's frustration limitation (as recent as April 2017) in that it doesn't seem to support ~/.ssh/config ProxyCommand option. Technically speaking no app is required for that workaround but it sure makes it convenient! <comment354460> @bogdan - Check out "SSH Tunnel" on the Mac App Store. It's a paid App, but I just bought it and love it (see related answer in this thread) <comment360712> Not really, since you can launch the terminal and run the command in the background, meaning you can just close the terminal. Can be set up as a script as well, instead of using a 3rd party app.
