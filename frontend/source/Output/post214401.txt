Where are emojis stored on Macs? <body> I saw the iPhone emoji and I want to get a high quality image of it to turn into the space grey color, but I can't find an image on the Internet. Does anyone know where the image file for the emoji is stored?  I am using OS X Yosemite.  Thanks.  <answer214659> Emojis are handled like any other fonts, the corresponding font file is stored in code/System/Library/Fonts/Apple Color Emoji.ttf/code. So there are no images per se which you could reuse (even ignoring any potential copyright problems).  Three options on how to get emoji images (without programming a little tool to parse the font file directly):  ul liuse the Character Viewer as described in https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/52558/9058 and a screen graber to get an image from the emoji you are interested in/li liuse Font Book to look at the characters/glyphs available in "Apple Color Emoji"/li liuse Google Image Search to find bigger image file representing the emoji you need/li /ul  <comment258897> Do the answers to http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/52557/where-can-i-find-an-explained-list-of-emoji-emoticons-used-in-ios?rq=1 help? If not, are you looking for one specific emoji (which one) or for all? <comment258944> I'm looking for where all of the image files for the emojis are stored on my hard drive.
