iOS app that scans Contacts for birthdays and anniversaries and provide notifications for same <body> I am looking for an App that reminds me of Birthdays and Anniversaries. If app can remind me of other dates, it would be "icing on cake" (added advantage).  I know notifications can be handled by native/default Calendar app available on any iOS device.  But catch is, App has to scan contacts and show/notify Birthdays and Anniversaries.  Default Calendar app does good job when it comes to scanning and notifying about Birthdays. But I want app to notify me both - Birthdays and Anniversaries.  I found two app from App store  ol liYearly (Paid - link): I saw app screenshots, but didn't find any instance of anniversaries./li liAnniversary Reminder (Free, Ads-Supported - link): Bad UI, also ads :(/li /ol  If anyone is using Yearly, I would like to know how it handles anniversaries.  If you know any other app that does what I need, let me know via your response/reply.  <answer214898> I got Yearly - link. It's working quite well.
