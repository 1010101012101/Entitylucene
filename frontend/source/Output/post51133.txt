What (hardware/software) projector setup is needed to project both displays? <body> I have a (non-Thunderbolt) 17" MacBook Pro connected to an external display. I want to project both screens (from MBP and external displays) each onto separate screens.  Is there a way to do this? And how to set it up?  <answer51138> You basically need to have your macbook output to two displays, which it won't do easily/willingly.  There are a couple hacks...either doing the display output over USB or using a matrox display. See more info: here  One emreally/em hacky solution might be to output via air display to and iPad (hooked up to a projector)for the 2nd monitor. I'll buy you a beer if you make that work. :-)  <comment58517> Thanks for replying. Somehow I don't think I'll be able to earn that beer.  :)
