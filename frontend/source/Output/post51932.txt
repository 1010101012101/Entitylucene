Is there a dock available that can dock an iPhone (with bumper) <body> The Apple dock cannot take the bumper, you need to take off the bumper.  I need a dock for work and at work where I can just slip my phone in (bumper and all).  Any ideas?  <answer51933> Amazon sells a dock from Oriongadget which will allow you to dock an iPhone with his bumper. It will cost you $23.00.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PnXml.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer51982> Probably, not due to the large variation possible with iPhone cases it would be difficult for a exact fit to a specific dock you would almost nead a special dock for each case out there.   The good news is that there is a very good compromise solution and that is a dock connector extension that will allow the iPhone and case to be raised out of the dock and clear most obstructions with most cases and iPhone / iPod docks.  Something such as the Dock Extender by SendStation should do what you want.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DPNRz.jpg" alt="DockExtender by Sendstation in action"
