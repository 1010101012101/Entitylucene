How to get hotmail account to work on a 4th gen ipod-touch? <body> I have an old 4th generation Ipod-Touch (8 gb, model MC540LL/A)  I'm trying to set it up to get my Hotmail (now outlook.live.com) emails, but everything I try doesn't work, it's like the authentication on the pop server just doesn't work (even with correct username/password)   Is there an up to date procedure for setting that up?  I searched google and here but didn't find anything conclusive  Thank you,  <comment331609> Microsoft have an app for that, use it. It's also a better option than Apple Mail: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id951937596 <comment331998> I get a message that this app requires iOS 9.0 or later. With this ipod I can't get later that iOS 6.1.6
