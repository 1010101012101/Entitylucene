Renaming the volume or folder in which the Aperture library resides <body> When you rename or move folders or volumes on a Mac, do applications know the files moved.  Specifically, I have an external drive with a name, say "A very long long name", and I want to rename the drive to "Short-Name"  And inside that Drive, I have a folder with a long name which I want to rename to a shorter name.  Aperture is referencing these paths in a very large library (100,000 images)  Thanks!  <answer99227> Aperture will continue to look in the old location until you tell it differently. To do this:  ol liQuit Aperture before changing the volume/folder names./li liMake your changes in Finder./li liReopen Aperture and go to Aperture  Preferences./li liClick General, if necessary./li liUnder the Library Location option, click Choose./li liLocate your library and click Select./li liQuit Aperture and restart it./li /ol
