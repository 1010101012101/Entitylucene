System not loading after trying to run in safe mode <body> I am using Yosemite I tried to upgrade its version and I started seeing busy cursor. I then tried to run in safe mode and since then not booting up.  Verify and repair disk failing too. For safe mode I press shift key in start. What do I do now? Right now I don't have startup disk either   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kqKTe.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Ran in single mode and I get this img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/B10Cw.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Forced fschk now gives this error   I had run command emfsck_hfs -y -Rc -d /dev/disk0s2/em which also changed volume to emRecovery mode/em and now n boot always show recovery screen. Is my data safe?  Smart status verified  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jbZTG.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Hbkw4.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment304110> "I/O error" would indicate the drive is failing, physically. Simplest would be to swap drives & restore from Time Machine. If no backup, then stop trying to 'fix' the drive & instead turn to data recovery options. <comment304112> It's failing for Macintosh HD volume and for base file system it verified OK. How all of sudden a new drive stopped failing after running to safe mode? <comment304113> @Tetsujin check updated question <comment304117> I doubt the problem has anything to do with safe mode -- from your description, I'd guess the disk was already having trouble during the upgrade (causing the busy cursor), and that trying to install the upgrade files on a bad disk corrupted the volume. <comment304118> @GordonDavisson you seem right. Now issue is I ran forced fschk and now it turned volume to *recovery HD* and locked. Is my data safe? <comment304119> I q run *fschk-hfs -r ..* it rebuilt catalog and now changed volume t recovery HD <comment304122> I am going to echo the "your disk is failing" sentiment already here.  To verify this, boot into recovery or off an Installer and launch Terminal and execute this command:  `diskutil info /dev/disk0 | grep -i smart`   If it returns anything but "Verified", your disk is dying and it's time for a new one. <comment304125> Your data is *not* safe; depending on the extent of the failure, it *might* be recoverable. I'd recommend against further attempts to repair the volume, since if the drive has a hardware problem it's just likely to make things worse. I'd replace the drive, install a new OS, *then* try to recover any important files from the old drive. Actually, I'd recommend taking it to a repair shop (and make sure they either can do data recovery themselves, or at least will give you the old drive back so you can take it somewhere else). <comment304157> @GordonDavisson while I can't see my data files after running forced fschk, will my data be visible if I use it as external drive and access in Windows? <comment304158> No, Windows doesn't know how to read the volume format OS X uses (Mac OS Extended) without additional software (and with the right additional software, it'd see a corrupt volume and refuse to mount it). If you want to try recovering the files yourself, the first thing I'd try is installing [DiskWarrior](http://www.alsoft.com/DiskWarrior/) on another Mac (or your Mac with a new internal system disk), connecting the damaged drive as an external, then using DiskWarrior's capability to mount a virtual cleaned-up version (*not* to try to repair the disk), and copy files from that. <comment304159> Note that there's no guarantee that the DiskWarrior approach will work; t depends on exactly what's gone wrong and how bad the damage is. In my experience, data recovery often involves trying a bunch of different things to see what'll work (and if how they fail gives an indication of what else to try). There's no single procedure that "just works". <comment304160> @GordonDavisson why thvolume changed from *Macintosh HD* to *Recovery HD* also did I do blunder to keep data files in Mac. Partition and I should have created non Mac partition, if possible, for data files? <comment304161> And it also says volume is locked <comment304163> @Allan smart status verified question updated <comment304166> @GordonDavisson question updated with image . Smart status. Is verified <comment304167> Unfortunately, SMART status being "Verified" does not mean much. Recovery HD is a different (normally hidden) partition used for recovery mode. Mac format is not a mistake, it just means you need Mac recovery tools, not Windows recovery tools. Your real mistake is not having a backup.
