What this ifconfig output telling me? <body> What is this output of ifconfig telling me? Any explanation of the first in particular would be sweet.  precodeA:~ Linda$ ifconfig  lo0:  flags=8049&lt;UP,LOOPBACK,RUNNING,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 16384       options=3&lt;RXCSUM,TXCSUM&gt;       inet6 ::1 prefixlen 128        inet 127.0.0.1 netmask 0xff000000        inet6 fe80::1%lo0 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x1        nd6 options=1&lt;PERFORMNUD&gt;  gif0: flags=8010&lt;POINTOPOINT,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1280  stf0: flags=0&lt;&gt; mtu 1280  en0:  flags=8822&lt;BROADCAST,SMART,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500       options=2b&lt;RXCSUM,TXCSUM,VLAN_HWTAGGING,TSO4&gt;       ether 00:1e:c2:1d:0c:15        media: autoselect       status: inactive  en1:  flags=8863&lt;UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500       ether 00:1e:c2:ba:ce:23        inet6 fe80::21e:c2ff:feba:ce23%en1 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x5        inet 192.168.1.2 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.1.255       nd6 options=1&lt;PERFORMNUD&gt;       media: autoselect       status: active  fw0:  flags=8822&lt;BROADCAST,SMART,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 4078       lladdr 00:1f:5b:ff:fe:13:0d:f0        media: autoselect &lt;full-duplex&gt;       status: inactive /code/pre  <answer173799> strongTl;dr/strong    For your Mac "lo0" is almost the same as the "me" is for you in your question!  stronglo0:/strong is the loopback address of your computer:  wikipedia says:     Implementations of the Internet Protocol Suite include a virtual network interface through which network applications can communicate when executing on the same machine. It is implemented entirely within the operating system's networking software and passes no packets to any network interface controller. Any traffic that a computer program sends to a loopback IP address is simply and immediately passed back up the network software stack as if it had been received from another device.      Unix-like systems usually name this loopback interface lo or lo0.      Various Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) standards reserve the IPv4 address block 127.0.0.0/8, in CIDR notation and the IPv6 address ::1 for this purpose. The most common IPv4 address used is 127.0.0.1. Commonly these loopback addresses are mapped to the hostnames, localhost or loopback.   strongen0:/strong  en0 is your first physical network interface.  Usually it's the internal Ethernet nic (Network interface controller). It's not activated - probably no ethernet cable is connected - and doesn't have an IP-address.  strongen1/strong  en1 is your second physical network interface.  Usually it's the Wi-fi interface. It's activated and connected to an access point and has the IP-address 192.168.1.2, the netmask 255.255.255.0 and the broadcast address 192.168.1.255.  strongfw0:/strong  fw0 is your third physical network interface.  That's your Firewire interface. It's not activated - probably no Firewire cable is connected - and doesn't have an IP-address.  <comment204511> The (lo0) loopback address is practically useless in the real world, but its basic function is to test whether or not a network adapter is ready to send/receive packets via TCP/IP. Basically, if you can ping the loopback address, then TCP/IP is installed. <comment204522> There are 32 lines of output. What precicely are you looking to learn? Just edit the post to make things clearer if you're not ready to accept one of the answers provided. <comment204529> Thank you very much for taking the time to clearly explain.  I'm slightly less ignorant thanks to you ! <comment204542> @user115525 You are welcome! ;-) If you have any additional questions regarding all the other terms (e.g. flags/inet6/options) just add it by editing your question or post a comment.
