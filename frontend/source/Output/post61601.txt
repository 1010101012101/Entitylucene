Sending e-mail attachment from MS Office <body> There's an option in MS Office 2011 for Mac programs that allows to send current document as an e-mail attachment. However in my case this option is inactive:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ysq9I.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  I can't find any option to setup e-mail client in Word/Excel preferences. How do I fix it?  <answer61631> Oh ! I think I have seen this before  Try the following:  Start Apple Mail  ol liGo to MailPreferencesGeneral/li liThe top line that reads "Default Email Reader" must show either Outlook or    Mail./li liIf it doesn't, please go ahead and change it./li /ol  you might have google set as of now.   Hope this works!  <comment71148> Is the Office suite up to date? You might want to check for updates and check to see if the issue still exists? <comment71150> I've checked it and it's up to date. <comment71164> you have any luck?
