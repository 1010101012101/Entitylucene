MacBook Pro flashes globe and won't respond to holding keys on boot <body> I've got a MacBook Pro 13â€³ MD101. After replacing the HDD it flashes a globe on the screen. Now here's the strange thing, the unit does not respond to key inputs. I've tried the option key on startup, recover mode, reset NVRAM/PRAM, SMC, target disk mode nothing happens. It ignores all that and goes straight and flashes the globe.  I spoke to one of the Apple guys and he said I might have to replace the MLB! I don't understand, it was working just fine. This issue only occurred right after I replaced the hdd.  <comment344789> Which Apple guy?  What is the MLB?  The globe you see might be the same as the one mentioned on https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204323.
