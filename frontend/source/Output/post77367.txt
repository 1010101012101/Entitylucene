Is there a GUI viewer of databases created by Database Events? <body> I wrote a simple AppleScript that saves data to a Database Events database. I see the database (DBEV file) in my code~/Documents/Databases/code folder, and I am wondering if there is a simple graphical utility that I can use to view its contents.  <answer77663> I ended up creating my own: https://github.com/dtrebbien/Songs-Database-Viewer  In my case, the database is a simple database of songs, where each record has "Artist Name" and "Song Title" fields, so my Songs Database Viewer just has two columns for those fields. Though, Songs Database Viewer is adaptable to other schemas by adding more table columns in Interface Builder and setting the identifiers of the table columns to the field names.  Alternatively, a Database Events database is based on SQLite3, so the DBEV file can be opened with the command line codesqlite3/code utility. On Lion, the two important tables are codeZRECORD/code and codeZFIELD/code. Each row in codeZRECORD/code corresponds to a Database Events record and each row in codeZFIELD/code corresponds to a Database Events field.
