MS Office not fully Retina compatible? <body> I have MS Office 14.2.4, a.k.a. “the Office 2011 update that added Retina support”. However, when I insert a PDF into my document, it seems to me that it does not display at the native Retina resolution, but at half-resolution. The PDF contains vector graphics and text, so the resolution issue does not come from the PDF. To give an example, here is a screenshot of PDF image inserted:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rDLKJ.png" alt="enter image description here"  You can clearly see the difference in resolution between the text in the Word document (the “Figure 1…” line) and the text and graphics in the PDF image once inserted in the Word document (the rest).  I haven't manage to find any information about that issue on the web, so I wonder: strongdo others see the same problem? Is it documented by Microsoft? Is there a workaround?/strong
