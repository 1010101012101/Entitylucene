Will a Macbook Pro retina 15" from 2012 support WQHD resolution (3440 x 1440)? <body> I'm interested in buying the Dell U3415W for my mid 2012 MBPr 15". I know that thunderbolt 1 can drive regular 1440p displays such as a 2560 x 1440, however can it drive the Dell's wider resolution?  <answer248926> No, according to EveryMac     This model supports a simultaneous maximum resolution up to 2560x1600 on two external displays via Thunderbolt. Alternately, it can support   a single display up to 2560x1600 via Thunderbolt and a single display   up to 1920x1200 via HDMI. Although it can theoretically power all   three external displays, as confirmed by a helpful reader, it runs too   hot with three displays connected.   <answer249023> I actually tried it, and it worked! Full 3440 x 1440 resolution at 60 Hz using thunderbolt to mini display port.
