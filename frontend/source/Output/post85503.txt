Quickly mark all emails as read? <body> Is there a way to quickly mark all emails as read instead of going over each one of them manually ?  <answer85506> From Menubar 1. Edit - Select Allbr 2. Message - Mark - As Read  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/330ju.jpg" alt="select all"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rQYL0.jpg" alt="mark as rea"  <answer85507> Select all the mails you want using kbdCmd/kbd-click (one by one), kbdShift/kbd-click (a range), or kbdCmd/kbd-kbdA/kbd (all in mailbox), then either right-click or kbdControl/kbd-click and select codeMark -&gt; As Read/code. This option is also available through the menu: codeMessage -&gt; Mark -&gt; As Read/code. The keyboard shortcut kbdShift/kbdkbdCmd/kbdkbdU/kbd will also do the same thing.
