How to disable the built-in MacBook keyboard? <body> Is it possible to completely disable the built-in keyboard on a MacBook? No input should be possible from that keyboard when I connect an external keyboard. This is sort of possible with the trackpad and the mouse, is there an option (or indeed a hack!) to do the same with the built-in hardware?   <answer67143> From Googling around, I found this page. It suggests that you unload a codeAppleUSBTCKeyboard.kext/code to disable keyboard:  precodesudo kextunload /System/Library/Extensions/AppleUSBTopCase.kext/Contents/PlugIns/AppleUSBTCKeyboard.kext /code/pre  This will prompt you for your password and then give some errors, but it emdoes/em disable the built in keyboard (tested on my ML 10.8.2)  To re-enable the builtin keyboard, load the kext file again:  precodesudo kextload /System/Library/Extensions/AppleUSBTopCase.kext/Contents/PlugIns/AppleUSBTCKeyboard.kext /code/pre  BTW, I noticed that this immediately prints all that was typed on the builtin keyboard, so be ready for this (in Terminal this should probably just output some text).  <answer217088> There is a little utility called Keyboard Cleaner and it seems to work fine for me on 10.10.5. You run the program and only codecmd + k/code stay functional to then quit it.  http://jan.prima.de/~jan/plok/archives/48-Keyboard-Cleaner.html  <answer235266> ul liInstall Karabiner/li liSearch for "disable" as seen in this image/li liCheck the corresponding box/li /ul  Reddit Source  <comment79416> How about some of the solutions suggested in [this similar superuser question](http://superuser.com/questions/185819/how-to-disable-the-internal-keyboard-on-a-macbook-pro)? <comment93697> I started down the path of turning this into an applescript that would automatically toggle the internal keyboard on and off:  sudo kextfind /System/Library/Extensions/AppleUSBTopCase.kext/Contents/PlugIns/AppleUSBTCKeyboard.kext/ 2 /tmp/keyboard-kext-out; if [ -s /tmp/keyboard-kext-out ]; then; echo "Kext is NOT loaded"; else; echo "Kext is loaded"; fi  But I couldn't quite get it to work. Here's hoping that  someone else with more motivation that me can pull that off. <comment134151> Does this still work for you on OS X Mavericks 10.9.1? It used to work for me before, but now I'm getting:       (kernel) Can't unload kext com.apple.driver.AppleUSBTCKeyboard; classes have instances:     (kernel)     Kext com.apple.driver.AppleUSBTCKeyboard class AppleUSBTCKeyboard has 1 instance.     Failed to unload com.apple.driver.AppleUSBTCKeyboard - (libkern/kext) kext is in use or retained (cannot unload). <comment153688> Iâ€™m getting the same error as @john2x but it does seem to be working despite the warning. <comment166220> Yes working for me too on 10.9.4 despite the warning. <comment179681> Just a quick note that this also works under Yosemite, despite the warnings. <comment233413> This seems to cause a kernel panic on El Capitan Public Beta. <comment309621> Just what I needed, thanks! <comment340621> Yeah this stopped working for me too only recently. I need to disable it because I can't afford to get my laptop fixed yet and occasionally it types random keys while a large chunk of them have stopped working altogether. So I use a BT keyboard for now. But it worked fine up until a few weeks ago. I get the same message john2x gets. Something about it being in use or retained. I'm almost tempted to delete the AppleUSBTopCase.kext bundle itself as a last resort but I don't know what else it might control. So of course I don't take the risk.
