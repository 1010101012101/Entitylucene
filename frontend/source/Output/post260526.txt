Notification Banner not going away on El Capitan <body> When I had Yosemite I set bannerTimeout to 25 seconds:  precodedefaults write com.apple.notificationcenterui bannerTime 25 /code/pre  After upgrading to El Capitan, I'm not able to change the settings. I've tried to delete codebannerTime/code:   precodedefaults delete com.apple.notificationcenterui bannerTime /code/pre  But still I've to click close button to each banner. I've logged out and restarted but didn't work.  How can I reset to default?
