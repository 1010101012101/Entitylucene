How do I delete empty space from the MIDDLE of a recording on Garageband? <body> Here's my issue:  Recorded a podcast that we're splitting into a two-part episode.  Editing part 1 was easy:  I just deleted everything at the end.  However, making Part 2 is trickier.  Now I have an intro, 25 mins of blank space and then the rest of the audio (that was cut to make Part 1).  Any idea how to get rid of a large chunk of blank space in the emmiddle/em without individually having to drag over all of the remaining audio?
