Is there a way to blacklist USB devices without unplugging? <body> I'd like to prevent an USB device from registering (e.g. the internal Bluetooth hub). Is there a way to blacklist/disconnect USB devices without physically unplugging them?  <comment154015> What's the problem you're trying to solve? Perhaps there's another approach <comment154045> I'm trying to use an external Bluetooth dongle rather than the internal one, due to wifi-coexistance issues that are causing major interference problems.
