Update Apple ID to iCloud @me address <body> I previously had an Apple ID account, and I logged in using my gmail address. Now I have a @me.com address and I'd like to use that to log in.  How can I change the address I log into my Apple ID account (e.g. when downloading apps) to my new @me address?  <answer27559> Does this help?
