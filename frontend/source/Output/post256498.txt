MacBook Pro Retina intermittent connection to Virgin Super Hub 2ac <body> My new MacBook Pro Retina running OS X El Capitan has intermittent connection to Virgin Super Hub 2ac (while connecting fine to other Wi-Fi networks). This isn't a problem with Internet connection, as all other devices connect without any trouble, and the problem is there when trying to connect just to the router itself.   What happens is that a series of packets go through quickly, and then a series fail, and this repeats for as long as I'm using it. I previously had a Late 2012 MacBook Pro Retina running OS X 10.9.5, which had no such problems.  Fortunately, the method of deleting various plist files and rebooting described here works fine for me, but I have to do it every time the laptop wakes from sleep. So I'm wondering if anyone has any idea of what exactly gets written into these files tat messes things up and whether it could be fixed more systemically?  <comment319986> Has the superhub been rebooted recently? They're notoriously flaky devices - I eventually removed mine from the equation altogether & have had no issues since.
