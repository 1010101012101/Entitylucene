Is it possible to "restore" an itunes iphone backup to an ipad? <body> Is it possible to "restore" an iphone backup to an ipad, or an ipod touch?  Obviously there are iphone specific apps etc. but can you get most of your data (like passwords f.ex.) into an ipad/ipod touch from an itunes backup of an iphone?  <answer154128> Yes, the backups are interchangeable between device types.  <comment181409> Just don't forget you can't restore to a device that only supports an older iOS version. So you can't restore an iPhone 6 backup to an original iPad, for example.
