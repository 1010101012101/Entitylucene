How can I click "Do It!" button with keyboard? <body> This was been question for a long time for me. How can I click "Do It!" button? Do-It button means, a button will trigger destructive changes. So usually, that's not default button, and I don't know how to click it with keyboard.  I'm asking this because I got a real fantastically suiting situation for need of this.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/S0mYs.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer61597> If there's just one option hitting kbdSpace/kbd or kbdEnter/kbd should do the trick, as the button should be preselected. If there are more than one option you could tab between them by enabling  strongAll Controls/strong under strongSystem Preferences / Keyboard / Full Keyboard Access/strong.   When tabbing through, a subtle blue glow will highlight the emtabbed/em component. Hitting kbdSpace/kbd will emuse/em it, while hitting kbdEnter/kbd will emuse/em the default option.  <comment71121> In many slide down alerts like that, you can drag the edges to widen the alert. In your case, that may fix the wrapping, and let you see. <comment71266> A stupid question, I recognize the dock-icon with the lily (left to Parallels), but I can't remember the title. What software is this?
