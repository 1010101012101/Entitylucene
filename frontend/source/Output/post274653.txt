Change resolution on external display <body> I am currently using macbook pro 2012( non-retina model ) having resolution strong1280 X 720/strong. When i connect it to external display( strongsupporting max resolution 1366 X 768/strong ) using mini display port, external display switches to 1280 X 720 because of which strongquality reduces due to stretching/strong. There is strongno option for 1366 X 768 resolution/strong in display settings for external display.  Is there any way to select that resolution for external display and use strongindependent resolution/strong on both the screens.  <comment345369> Are you mirroring your display or extending it? <comment345371> @Allan mirroring <comment345372> If you are mirroring, the display will go to the "lowest common resolution" - in this case 1280x720.  Try either using just the external display or extending the display - can you get the resolution you want? <comment345377> how to use just the external display or extending it? No, I am not getting desired resolution ie 1360 X 768. Both displays are responding to changes and max resolution available is 1280 X 720
