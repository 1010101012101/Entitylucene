What happened to the rename song iTunes keyboard shortcut? <body> The keyboard shortcut that used to enter rename mode for the currently selected song no longer works in iTunes. Has it changed, or disappeared?  <answer96513> Pressing kbd⌤ enter/kbd / kbdfn/kbd + kbd↩ return/kbd always works for me…  In addition, kbd⌘ cmd/kbd + kbd↩ return/kbd also works emmost of the time/em.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yW1N6.png" alt="Screenshot: Editing a Song Title"
