Where does iTunes save iOS updates? <body> When I choose to install a new version of iOS on my device via iTunes, the installation file is huge (e.g. 750 MB). Where does iTunes save this file, and does it get deleted after the installation is done?  <answer49406> strongOn Windows XP/strongbr codeDocuments and Settings\&lt;User&gt;\Application Data\Apple Computer\iTunes\iPhone Software Updates/code  strongOn Windows Vista/Windows 7/strongbr codeUsers\&lt;User&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Apple Computer\iTunes\iPhone Software Updates/code  strongOn Mac/strongbr code~/Library/iTunes/iPhone Software Updates/code  I believe that the updates do not delete after they are installed.  Via this iPhone FAQ article.  <answer88334> C:\ProgramData\Apple Computer\iTunes  <answer103749> On Mac, you can delete the iOS firmware by going to Finder, pressing kbd⌘ cmd/kbd + kbd⇧ shift/kbd + kbdG/kbd and go to code~/Library/iTunes/iPhone Software Updates/code. From there, you can delete the files.  You don't have to delete them unless you are short on disk space, as they get replaced by newly downloaded files whenever there is an upgrade.  <comment56581> I have only 5.1 there, so I am guessing the previous ones are deleted when a new one is downloaded. <comment117709> Where is it stored in windows 8? <comment148954> and for iPad the path is ~/Library/iTunes/iPad Software Updates/ <comment171931> Is it safe to remove these (update) installation files? I just upgraded my iPad and iPod to iOS 8 and am running very low on disk space on my Mac. <comment171946> Yes, these are only where your Mac stores the files used to update your device.
