Virtual Hosts Not Working on OSX Mavericks <body> In Mac OS X 10.9.3 I've Included http-vhosts in httpd.conf  precode# Virtual hosts Include /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf /code/pre  I've commented out the DocumentRoot and the Directory in httpd.conf  precode# DocumentRoot "/Library/WebServer/Documents" # &lt;Directory "/Library/WebServer/Documents"&gt;...&lt;/Directory&gt; /code/pre  I've added the following to my httpd-vhosts.conf file  precode&lt;VirtualHost *.80&gt;     DocumentRoot /Users/gdboling/Sites/rocket-gen     ServerName local.rocket-gen.com     &lt;Directory "/Users/gdboling/Sites/rocket-gen"&gt;         Options Indexes FollowSymLinks         AllowOverride All         Order allow,deny         Allow from all     &lt;/Directory&gt; &lt;/VirtualHost&gt; /code/pre  And I've added the following to my /etc/hosts file  precode127.0.0.1    local.rocket-gen.com /code/pre  I've restarted Apache  precodesudo apachectl restart /code/pre  There is an index.html in that directory but when I access http://local.rocket-gen.com from the browser I get a 404. I am getting this in the error logs  precode[Tue Jun 17 19:09:10 2014] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] File does not exist: /usr/htdocs /code/pre  I can't figure out why it is not working. If I create that directory as the DocumentRoot in httpd.conf it works. But I need to have several Virtual Hosts, so I'd like to get the vhosts file to work.  <answer139131> This happened to me when I upgraded to Mavericks (10.9.5).  Apple seems to have removed the “Web Sharing” from the “System Preferences” app, which was important to the way the codehttp.conf/code file was written.  Two ways to fix it:  ol liStart apache with WEBSHARING_ON defined:/li /ol     apachectl -k start -D WEBSHARING_ON   ol start="2" liEdit the codehttp.conf/code file to remove code&lt;IfDefine WEBSHARING_ON&gt;/code and corresponding code&lt;/IfDefine&gt;/code, BUT NOT the contents between the tags./li /ol  <answer139150> It looks like you have nearly everything correct. I'm running Mavericks with a couple dozen virtual hosts, so this should work for you.   First, and this might be all you need to do to fix things, you need to enclose your DocumentRoot in quotes. So,   precodeDocumentRoot /Users/gdboling/Sites/rocket-gen /code/pre  becomes    precodeDocumentRoot "/Users/gdboling/Sites/rocket-gen" /code/pre  Next, add the following to your code/etc/hosts/code file, on the line immediately following what you already have. Your codehosts/code file should be:   You have this part:  precode127.0.0.1    local.rocket-gen.com /code/pre  Now add this right below:  precode::1     local.rocket-gen.com /code/pre  I have each of my vhosts set in codehosts/code this way.   <answer169565> Obviously, your apache cannot find its defined document root. In my opinion you mix some things up.  First, correct the typo within the VirtualHost container. You define addressing a port with a colon, not a "."  precode&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;...&lt;/VirtualHost&gt; /code/pre  Second, if you want to host multiple servers by name and not by IP address, you need to use name-based virtual hosts. Then of course in Apache configuration you missed the NameVirtualHost directive, if you want to set it up this way.   precodeNameVirtualHost server1.example.org:80 /code/pre  (http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/vhosts/name-based.html)  ALWAYS set the ServerName, otherwise apache cannot chdir to your new documentroot.  Third, in the main httpd.conf configuration part you commented out the DocumentRoot. Did you also do this with the access rules in the "Directory /" section for your former DocumentRoot?  Fourth, if you want to set up hard VirtualHost instead of NameVirtualHost, do not forget the Listen directive. So for that you need a  precodeListen *:80 /code/pre  in your main httpd.conf. If you want to setup different servers on different IP addresses, you need to configure them like this:  ul liadd IP Address and resolvable name in /etc/hosts/li liadd "Listen server1.example.com:80" in main httpd.conf/li lirefer to your server instance like code&lt;VirtualHost server1.example.com:80&gt;.../code/li liALWAYS set the ServerName/li /ul  <comment261363> The `::1 ...` part is what I was missing.
