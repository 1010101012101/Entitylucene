Can't click anything in Mac OS Lion (mouse movement works, no hand cursor for clickables) <body> I have Mac OS Lion, version 10.7, and after my screensaver activates, sometimes I can no longer click anything successfully.  I'm using a Magic Mouse with almost full battery.  These things still work:  ul liMoving the mouse cursor/li liRight-clicking things/li /ul  However, when I move the mouse cursor over something that's clickable in the browser, I don't see the hand cursor. Also when I mouse over the right-click context menu, the rows don't highlight in blue.  I can't click in to any window, menu bar, or desktop item. Switching to another virtual desktop doesn't help. When I did move to another virtual desktop, I noticed that there was a bandbox selected on the desktop that was still attached to my mouse movements, but when I right-clicked it went away and the mouse still doesn't work as described above.  The only solution right now is to logout. I haven't installed any drivers on this machine, it's a brand-new Mac Mini that came with Lion on it.  I'm running these programs: * MacVim * Adium * Google Chrome * iTunes * iTerm latest version  These are the same applications I run on my MacBook Air with Lion installed, and I never get the same problem even with a Magic Mouse connected.  Does anyone know how to fix this?  I also have a Magic Trackpad connected, and it continues to work fine. Clicking with it doesn't un-jam the mouse, though.  <answer40594> It seems that disconnecting and reconnecting the mouse works.  Does anyone think the mouse is defective?  <comment45907> Sound like that may be the problem. I would suggesting trying the mouse on another computer and see if it exhibits the same problem. <comment66887> After several months this hasn't happened again. Odd.
