Select distinct keyboard layout by keyboard shortcut <body> I use multiple keyboard layouts (3+), very often switching between them, also within sentences.  Stepping to all of them is tiresome.  In Windows, I can assign shortcuts per language. (Ctrl + 1 for German, Ctrl. + 2 for Ukrainian, Ctrl. + 3 for Russian etc.)  Is this possible also on Mac OS? I have hard tried searching, but not found any solution so far.  <comment355651> See this earlier answer to the same question   https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/69720/assigning-shortcuts-to-particular-keyboard-layouts?rq=1 <comment355652> Another one   https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/61250/bind-each-keyboard-layout-to-keys-combination
