IOS 8 and App Store wrong language <body> Since the new IOS 8 I have had several problems with my iPad. One of which is the App Store is in Turkish I have checked my country and language everything is fine. Since its in Turkish it will not allow me to update any programs saying I need to switch to the U.S. Store, how do I do that? Several of my games no longer work  after the upgrade.  <answer146507> All the way at the bottom right corner of the Apple Store screen there is a round symbol representing which country Apple store are you in.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SWC1u.jpg" alt="country"  Click on it and it will bring you choices to switch country.  <answer146531> Beside what @Buscarì›ƒ suggests, I would recommend:  ol liGo to strongSettings  iTunes &amp; App Store/strong/li liLogout your Apple ID/li liRe-login Apple ID: If iOS detects the App Store language does not match your Apple ID's mapped Store location, it will launch App Store &amp; switch to that language./li /ol  p.s. I always use this trick to switch between Japan &amp; Hong Kong store.  <answer154247> Close the open apps on your device and go to 1) Settings 2) Itunes &amp; App Store 3) select: Apple ID 4) choose: View Apple ID  5) provide your password. It should be working. Success!   <answer181099> I just had this issue.
