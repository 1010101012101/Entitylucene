How to connect mac screen to samsung smart tv with wireless for free? <body> I want to connect my mac so I can view its screen on a samsung smart tv. But I haven't been able to find a free way. There are apps which cost 10$ but I'm looking for a free solution since it is going to be a one time thing.  <comment321629> What is the model of your MacBook?
