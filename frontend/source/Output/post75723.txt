Facebook alert tones for iPhone 4S iOS 6 <body> I have a brand new iPhone 4S with iOS 6 update pre-installed. I have my sound settings turned on for Facebook posts and I can receive push notifications for Facebook. But, I don't receive any audible alerts. I've been through my settings time after time. I don't know know if this is an Apple problem or a Facebook app problem. Please help!  <comment96128> Do you get other audible alerts?
