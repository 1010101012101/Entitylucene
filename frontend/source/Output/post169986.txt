Time machine was interrupted - how to make it resume? <body> Time machine was running for the first time and it was NINE hours into the job, when it got stopped (I inadervently removed the usb connection).  Is there any way to get it to resume?    strongUPDATE/strong  The issue was that the Time Machine icon was not in my Dock - so I did not have option to right click which is where the "Back up now" option lives.  <comment199744> Click on Time Machine icon and the Backup Now. <comment199817> @jherran  thx see update to the OP
