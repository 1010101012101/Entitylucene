Is there a way to determine which iphone charger is newer? <body> I've got 2 chargers (both EU) here: One from an iPhone 7 and one from the 6. Both are almost identical in terms of look and labels, besides the manufacturer: one is flextronics the other one is salcomp.  I also know that there is a serial number inside the usb connector. There a way to decipher these and thereby determine the production date?  <comment321504> Buy a genuine, then look up the serial code. <comment321525> Can you clarify if these are Apple branded chargers or knock off, third party, or other quality non-Apple hardware? <comment321579> both are original apple chargers. <comment321581> @OzzieSpin: Where do I look it up? <comment322084> Put the serial code into google, <comment322085> But TBH, the charging wall plug that came with my 4, charges my 6 with no problem
