Music starts automatically when headphones are plugged into the iPhone <body> I have an iPhone 5 with the last version of iOS, 10.3.2. When I plug in the headphones into the jack, the music application starts automatically on the screen block, and starting to play music. I have no open application in the background when this happens. What are the reason and can be solved?  <answer284725> Most normal headphones don't do this but some might or might not start playing. Try pausing your music before you unplug. That should work as a temporary fix.
