How can I move my signature from one Mac Mail account to another? <body> Mac Mail has some nice features, and I have used it for many, many years. But I can not figure out how to move a signature from one account to another.  It makes no sense whatsoever that I can't use an existing signature on a new account.  I tried to just create the new signature for the new account. I tried to cut and paste from the old signature, unfortunately, the image does not come over.  Right-clicking and choosing Import Image in the signature actually tried to pull an image from a scanner or a camera? There doesn't appear to be a feature to import an image from your local files, which is just really beyond bizarre.  <answer233109> It seems like you are trying to do two different things a) attach an image to a signature; b) assign a signature to an account.  strongTo attach an image to your signature./strong  ol liAfter you open the Apple Mail preferences click on the Signature tab./li liIn the left column click on 'All Signatures'./li liEither click on an existing signature, or click on the '+' button below the middle column.

Then from the “Choose Signature” pop-up menu, below the signatures panel, select “In Sequential Order”.
