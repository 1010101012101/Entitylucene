How to know if (and when) a shutdown occurred due to power outage <body> I have a Mac in a remote location that operates as a server.  It's configured (from Energy Management) to automatically power up in case of blackout as the power comes back.  How can I tell if a power outage has happened (and the mac self-restarted later) and when ?  I guess I can inspect the console, but what should I search for?  <answer175907> If you can get to Terminal on your remote machine, just type codeuptime/codebr This won't, of course, tell you why it was last restarted, but when.  <comment207584> Yes, this is one solution. But uptime is reset also if I (or someone else managing the server) gracefully restart the machine. If that was, let's say, 30 days ago it's hard to remember...
