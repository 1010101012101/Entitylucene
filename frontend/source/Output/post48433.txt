Enable HiDPI on 23" iMac? <body> I have a 23" iMac running Lion (10.7.3). I've checked that the "Enable HiDPI display modes" checkbox is enabled in "Quartz Debug" (it was checked the first time I opened it), but there are no HiDPI resolution options in my display settings.  Has anyone had success with using HiDPI display modes on a 23" iMac?  <answer48457> Per the instructions on the screen, you have to log out and back in when enabling or disabling HiDPI mode for the changes to take effect:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zGd3z.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer54204> If the checkbox is already enabled, but it doesn't work, disable it, logout when prompted to, login again, re-enable it and at the next login you should find the HiDPI settings in the Displays settings.  <comment60795> I have the same problem and even after logging out and back in *and* restarting, HiDPI mode does not work at all. When I log back in, the checkbox is unchecked. <comment61641> Do you know what they mean by "virtual display modes" here? <comment62073> @Ken Virtual displays refers to hooking up a retina iOS device as a second monitor, and enabling the HiDPI mode on that "display". <comment63143> Do you know what causes this problem? I had two accounts logged in and had to sign out both accounts before I could successfully change the setting. <comment68004> This doesn't work for me...still...
