When do logs first start being recorded: at basic computer power-up or actually logging in as a user? <body> I am trying to figure out when logs (example: system.log) first start being created.  Does it only happen after a full login (going to the Desktop), or would basic power-on/shutdowns at the login screen (but not logging in at all) be fully recorded?    I have powered on/off, and logged in a million times and only see records when I actually log into an account (i.e. enter my password and go past the login screen and fully reach the Desktop). However, in some other discussions people mentioned logs could start earlier, so that even if you press the power button and shut-down without logging in, there would still be a record of it. Can someone explain this / does anyone have a definitive answer?  Thank you!  Example:  I powered on my computer, then immediately shut if off. Then powered it on again, and immediately shut it off (both times NOT logging into an account). I waited 10 minutes, then powered on and actually logged into my user account.  The first record shown in system.log was “BOOT_TIME” for the actual full account login - nothing for the simple power ups / shut-downs where I never went to the Desktop.    <comment236890> How exactly are you reading the logs - BOOT_TIME is written before anything else happens in the boot <comment236894> I only see "BOOT_TIME" in system.log when I log into the account and go to the Desktop. I don't see it when I power on/off without logging in (as previously discussed). I'm trying to figure out if others can generate logs from just "powering on/off" and not logging into the desktop.
