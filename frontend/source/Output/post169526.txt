Hide contact's name when sending an email <body> I am using somewhat "unofficial" names for people I work with in my Address Book. Basically, I add an emoji after the first name to help me recognize the contact faster (extremely helpful on the iPhone and on my email app on desktop - my contacts are synced between my mac and my iPhone..).  The thing is that somehow when I send an email to someone he see himself the way I saved him, resulting in an awkward situations sometimes... And even If I send an email to a colleague and he forward that email - the name with my emoji stays!  Is there a way to hide the way I save contacts when I am sending an email? I know that an email can have a First and Last name attached to it as default, can I show this somehow?  I am using Gmail account, Unibox app for mac to send emails, and all my contacts are synced between my devices.  <answer169535> Use the nickname field instead.br afaik, that doesn't transmit. (At least, no one's ever complained to me about what I call them ;)
