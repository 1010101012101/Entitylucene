How do I change the location of screen captures? <body> As a developer, I take a lot of screen captures. I often take a lot to share with StackExchange members on chat. The problem is my desktop is so cluttered with screen captures that they're now overlapping!  On Mac OS X 10.5.8, how do I change the default location where screen captures (taken with kbdCommand/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbd3/kbd or kbdCommand/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbd4/kbd) are placed?  strongEDIT:/strong I would prefer a solution which doesn't require installing any software.  <answer4141> If you use TinkerTool you can change the location that screen capture will saved:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iw0Ch.jpg" alt="alt text"  And also you can Add kbdcontrol/kbd to the two shortcuts above to place the screen shot on the clipboard instead of saving it to the desktop., and paste it in image Editor like Acorn.  <answer4143> According to this page...  precodedefaults write com.apple.screencapture location &lt;path&gt; /code/pre  Also, to turn on/off shadow:  precodedefaults write com.apple.screencapture disable-shadow -bool true defaults write com.apple.screencapture disable-shadow -bool false /code/pre  And to change file type:  precodedefaults write com.apple.screencapture type &lt;format&gt; /code/pre  You'll want to  precodekillall SystemUIServer /code/pre  to make the commands take effect.  <answer41078> Use the screen shots from Preview. You can save to any place you like, change the screenshot's name or file type. It is under Previews File menu.  <answer111320> I realize this question was asked years ago...  Nonetheless, I arrived here yesterday trying to fix the emnames/em (base filenames) of the screencapture PNG files.    Later I found the answer I needed, so I offer it here for future visitors.  If you hate the names looking like:  precodeScreen shot 2011-07-05 at 5.38.53 AM /code/pre  Then you can fix it in three steps:  First, run:  precodedefaults write com.apple.screencapture name "screenshot" /code/pre  Or use any word you want as a replacement for the default "Screen shot."  Then (bust out your superuser/sudo privileges and) edit this file:  precode/System/Library/CoreServices/SystemUIServer.app/Contents/Resources/English.lproj/Localizable.strings /code/pre  If your computer is not localized to use the "English.lproj", then locate the appropriate lproj in that same Resources folder.  Here is what to edit in Localizable.strings:  precode/* Format screencapture file names */ /* "%@ %@ at %@" = "%1$@ %2$@ at %3$@"; */ "%@ %@ at %@" = "%1$@_%2$@_%3$@"; /code/pre  Keep the left-hand-side as "%@ %@ at %@" and alter the right-hand-side  (after the equals sign) to your liking.  In the above snippet, underscores are used where previously whitespace was used.  Lastly, of course:  precodekillall SystemUIServer /code/pre  I found this info on this webpage, and it works for me on 10.6.  <comment3947> Thanks... any way to do it using `defaults` ? <comment3951> *Perfect*, Thank you! My desktop is happy now. <comment46519> You've misunderstood my question. Obviously I can *move* them after they're taking, I wanted to know how to change their location when they're taken. <comment131095> This is great info, but should be asked as a new question (How can I change the *name* of a screen capture file) and then copy your answer to that. It's perfectly Ok (and encouraged!) to ask and answer your own question in order to share knowledge. Post a comment on my question with a link to your question after you post it and I'll upvote you. <comment131141> @Josh - thanks! actually, you should probably just upvote Lri here: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/53422/save-screenshot-with-my-own-name#53470  ... I found Lri's answer *after* all this mess. The thing is: your question consistently showed up in google searches, and that other one *never* did (but i eventually found it just browsing stackexchange without google).
