What is the minimum Mac OS Partition size when using Boot Camp on a Macbook Air? <body> And does it vary with 128GB or 256GB size hard drives?  <answer57283> I don't see how this would depend on the type of Mac or hard drive. Instead, it should only depend on the strongversion of OS X/strong that you're running.  While Apple's documentations for OS X 10.7 Lion state strong7 GB/strong as a required minimum, BootCamp 4.0.3 allows a minimum of strong8GB/strong for the OS X partition. Probably, because this includes the strong650 MB/strong for the recovery partition (end of page).
