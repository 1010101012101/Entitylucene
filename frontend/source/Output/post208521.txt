How can I switch Chrome to display web pages with the San Francisco font in El Capitan? <body> I'd like for Chrome's default sans-serif font for websites to be San Francisco. However it's not showing up in the font list. Any ideas for how to change this setting?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vZlb4.png" alt="Chrome font settings dialog"  <answer216129> You will need to install the San Francisco font to be user-accessible. (See Can I use or access the San Francisco font that comes with El Capitan?) Once you do this, you will be able to set it as the default font in Chrome.
