How can I use the half-qwerty keyboard layout in OSX? <body> I'd like to use the half-qwerty keyboard layout on my mac, without actually buying any (ridiculously priced) hardware. I found a auto-hotkey script, but that appears to be windows-only. Are there any alternatives?  <answer33517> I found One Hand Keyboard, but at â‚¬79,99, it's a little too expensive to try out.  Edit: There's now a free demo available on the Mac App Store:  One-Hand Keyboard [Practice Version]  <answer33520> The Magic Frogpad also looks promising, but isn't quite half-qwerty, and still forces me to buy expensive hardware (even though I already have the touchpad).  <answer42961> I'm the developer of the one-handed typing Mac apps below. Should be just what you're looking for.  ul liOne-Hand Keyboard  /li liOne-Hand Keyboard: FREE demo/li liMirror-QWERTY/li /ul  One-Hand Keyboard is the best option, as it has predictive text. Just type the one-hand keys and it will automatically figure out which word you meant. Type code"tges"/code and it will change it to code"this"/code. Your muscle memory makes it very easy to do this.   Mirror-QWERTY is the non-predictive-text version. You hold spacebar to "mirror" the keys. So to type code"this"/code you type code[T] [G+Space] [E+Space] [S]/code. I find this a lot harder to do.  I hope one of these solutions works for you! Would love to hear your feedback.  <comment38224> I've listed some alternatives I've found (but aren't quite "it") as answers below. <comment45280> You can use [Ukelele](http://scripts.sil.org/ukelele) to create a custom keyboard layout, and use e.g. `Option` as the "flip" key instead of space.
