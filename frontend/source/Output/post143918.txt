Lacie petitekey write protected <body> I have a Lacie petitekey, and when I use it with my mac configuration (10.9.4) it says that the key is in read only.  I cannot format it as well, so I cannot really use it anymore regarding that it is impossible to put any data on it.  How can I be able to use it in write/read mode?  <answer199817> Apparently it was a failure of the key, I asked Lacie and they sent me another one.  So if you come across the same issue contact Lacie.  <comment240642> You should mark your question as answered.
