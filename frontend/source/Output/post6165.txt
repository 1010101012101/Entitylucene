How can I automatically start the Safari Reader? <body> Is there a way to tell Safari to automatically use Reader when it recognizes an article which it is able to display with Reader?  Right now I have to manually click the Reader button at the right side of the address bar.  <answer6187> I've tried to figure this out myself, and haven't yet come up with a way to load codesafari-resource:/Reader.html/code programmatically.  If necessary, I fall back to Readability, the 3rd-party Safari add-on Apple used as their basis for Reader. Combined with Safari Stand, I can modify the appearance of pages when they load.  <answer6199> Try kbdCMD + SHFT + R/kbd to save the effort of the precision mouse motion.  <answer101087> I've built a Safari extension for this. Download it from here:  http://finbarrbrady.com/2013/09/auto-reader-for-safari/  <comment6500> Could the downvoter please explain your issue with my answer? <comment6520> Yes, I know about that, but I wanted something automated and the "Readibility" bookmark as posted by Dori is absolutely bombastic, since it Safari Reader doesn't work on all sites. <comment6521> Wow, the Readability is absolutely awesome! Thanks Dori <comment6549> @senlamy - glad to hear you like it! If it works for you, please consider accepting my answer. <comment8254> By the way, Readabilty has just been dramatically improved - http://blog.readability.com/2011/01/the-new-readability/ <comment119013> Hi @Fin, thanks for your first answer, and thanks for attributing your involvement in the product you link to clearly (we are getting a lot of self-promotion spam, although this looks fair to me).
