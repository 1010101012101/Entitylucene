How to connect two LG 27UD88 to single thunderbolt 3 port <body> I have late 2016 MacBook Pro 13, which has thunderbolt 3 and according to specification can chain two 4k monitors. So if that's correct, how would it be possible to connect two LG 27UD88 monitors over single cable?  I suspect I need some hub that will input thunderbolt 3 and output 2 USB-C as that's what this monitor supports.  Also if this would work, will charing work too?  So basically I want to plug two monitors with a single cable and the same time chard my Mac.  Thanks.  <comment341623> An almost duplicate of [this Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/5g42s5/can_you_daisy_chain_usbc_monitors_to_a_macbook/?st=IYSV16NG&sh=f6d1346a) that basically says yes. You can do this. Only if you have 2 thunderbolt monitors. USB-C display port doesn't. <comment341639> bret7600, you are right, that's what I was looking for. Thank you.
