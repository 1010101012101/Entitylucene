MySQL fails to start at restart after Yosemite update <body> I have MySQL installed. When I had the previous version, it used to start after boot automatically. This is not the case after I updated to Yosemite. In System Preferences there is an icon for MySQL and "Automatically Start MySQL Server on Startup" is checked. I tried unchecking - restart - check - restart still the same..  Everytime I boot the computer I will need to start it manually. Any fix?  <answer153565> The best way I've found is to install MySQL with Homebrew, not from the .dmg available from the MySQL or Oracle. If you have Homebrew installed, simply run the following command in Terminal.  precodebrew install mysql /code/pre  Then to have MySQL start automatically, run the following:  precodebrew services start mysql /code/pre  <answer160213> MySQL by default tries to use StartupItems.  That won't work with Yosemite.  I made a launchd control that is still compatible with the MySQL preferencepane.  Details here - https://github.com/MacMiniVault/Mac-Scripts/blob/master/mmvMySQL/mmvmysql-Yosemite.md  <answer164275> From stackoverflow...  I've done this and it works. Pasted instructions below...  First, create a new file: code/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.mysql.mysql.plist/code  precode&lt;!--?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?--&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt;   &lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;KeepAlive&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;true /&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;com.mysql.mysqld&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;array&gt;       &lt;string&gt;/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqld_safe&lt;/string&gt;       &lt;string&gt;--user=mysql&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;/array&gt;           &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  Then update permissions and add it to launchctl:  precodesudo chown root:wheel /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.mysql.mysql.plist sudo chmod 644 /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.mysql.mysql.plist sudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.mysql.mysql.plist /code/pre  The reason you need this is because the StartupItems have been removed from Yosemite. There is a note at the start of the page in Apple's docs explaining this: Startup items are a deprecated technology. Launching of daemons through this process may be removed or eliminated in a future release of OS X.    <comment180571> Have you checked the system logs to see if there's anything there indicating why mysql is failing to load? <comment192588> You should probably file a bug against this issue with MySQL. The fact that they are still attempting to use Startup Items, six major releases of OS X after `launchd` was introduced, is troubling to say the least.
