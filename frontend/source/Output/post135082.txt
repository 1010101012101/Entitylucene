What is an alternative to a BAT file on Mac? <body> What is the alternate for BAT file (Windows) on Mac? Does different version of OS X have different format of BAT files? I am trying to create a BAT file on Mac which normally changes directory while the file is open.  <answer135085> Being pretty unfamiliar with batch files, I'm not sure of the functionality available, but there are two main scripting methods on OS X which are similar:  ul lih2AppleScript/h2  AppleScript is a scripting language which lets you control OS X and many applications.  AppleScripts are generally easy to understand and write whilst providing a lot of advanced functionality. Here is an AppleScript which counts the files in the Applications folder:  precodetell application "Finder"     if folder "Applications" of startup disk exists then         return count files in folder "Applications" of startup disk     else         return 0     end if end tell /code/pre  For more information about AppleScript, see:  ul lihttps://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/applescript/Conceptual/AppleScriptX/AppleScriptX.html/li /ul/li lih2Shell script/h2  A shell script is a script for a Unix shell.  The equivalent shell script to the above AppleScript is the following:  precodeif [ -d "/Applications/" ]; then     ls -1 "/Applications/" | wc -l fi /code/pre  As you're probably going to use bash, this is a good guide to get you started:  ul lihttp://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html//li /ul/li /ul  <answer205664> Look up .bash or .command on mac ;)  <comment160082> Look [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/589905/equivalent-of-double-clickable-sh-and-bat-on-mac) or [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14065069/equivalent-of-bat-in-mac-os) <comment160085> Look at Unix shell scripts or python, perl or other scripting languages <comment160097> Let's focus on general ways to do things similar to BAT files in this question.
