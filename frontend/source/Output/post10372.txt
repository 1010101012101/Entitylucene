How to close the window and quit the application when you press ESC key under OS X? <body> On Windows it is something common to close a window by pressing codeESC/code key. I'm looking for a solution that would allow me to close the current Window and the application when I press codeESC/code.  Currently the Preferences panel does not allow you to set a shortcut for codeESC/code.  Use case: you open a file from another application inside a viewer or editor and you want to return to the initial application just by pressing codeESC/code once.   <answer10374> You can press Command + W for closing the window and Command + Q to quit the applicaiton.  Like Open Word , open two different doc files and then if you wan to close only one file then just select that and press Command + w , only that file will be closed.   Hope this is the solutions for you.  <answer10381> Off the top of my head:  Downlod KeyRemap4Macbook http://pqrs.org/macosx/keyremap4macbook/  See if you can't find a setting for escape, I'm not sure if there is one. Remap it to Command + Q.  <comment10867> I am already aware about common shortcuts, my question was if I can obtain the specified behavior in some way. <comment10886> Most Windows apps don't quit when you hit escape; they usually only close dialog boxes and pop-up panels. This is the same behavior on the Mac.
