Exporting a Video in Quicktime in OS X Lion Shows only Audio <body> I'm trying to export a video in OS X Lion to either 480, 720, or 1080 but it only exports the audio file. After the export, the file is in .mov format but, when I play it, the file shows nothing, only the audio is played. Before I updated to Lion, I could export videos just fine. How can I resolve this issue?  <answer49409> Make sure that the "Audio only" option is not selected in the Export window.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9ktM6.png" alt="&quot;Audio Only&quot; menu item unselected"  <comment56470> what is the source e.g. file type, etc of the original video that you are trying to convert?
