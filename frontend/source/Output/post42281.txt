HP PSC 1350 Scanner OS X Lion <body> I just upgraded to OS X Lion. My HP PSC 1350 printer will print but it won't scan. HP's website says to remove, readd, etc, which I tried. It said I could get the generic driver from Apple software update, but nada. How can I scan in Lion with my HP PSC 1350?  <answer42286> I'm so happy! I found it and it works great!  http://support.apple.com/kb/DL907  These are the up-to-date HP Printer drivers appearently. If anyone else is having issues with their printer I'd suggest looking on Apple's website.
