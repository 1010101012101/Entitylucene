Can the list section shown in Day view in Calendar removed? <body> Now I've upgraded to Mountain Lion, when I look at Calendar in Day view, there's a ruddy great list in the middle of the window. I have 30 subscribed calendars that I need to be able to see and the list is not at all helpful.  As it only shows in Day view, can I change Week view to be a week of one day?  Anyone have any other ideas?  <answer60392> Sadly I think you are out of luck when it comes to this. Like most Apps that comes with OS X there isn't much space for customizing the UI.
