How I do permanently authorize an app on my mac? <body> I use Clean My Mac to periodically clean out old log files and caches. Right before the clean, it asks me permission and I have to enter my password to authenticate. Is there any way I can authorize the app once and skip this step every time?  <answer61689> No, it's asking for authentication not because the app needs it but because it's altering system files and OS X will always need authentication for this.  <answer215758> I don’t think there is a way to completely authorise the “Clean My Mac” application. The reason why it asks you to confirm your password is that you are authorising the app and to make sure it doesn’t starts by itself. Trust me, even I feel frustrated because of this, but in a whole, asking of permission is a better way.  <comment260672> What do you mean by "it doesn't start by itself"?
