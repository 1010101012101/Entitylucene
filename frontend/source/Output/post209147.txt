Update my IPod help <body> I have iOS 6.1.6 on my iPod touch gen 4 and I want to upgrade it to iOS 8 at the least, can anyone help me? I've checked it but it says it's up to date.  <answer209150> Your 4th generation iPod Touch can't be updated past iOS 6.1.6. See the list of supported devices for iOS 7:     strongiPod Touch/strong      ul   liiPod Touch (5th generation)/li   /ul   iOS 8 and 9 are the same story - your iPod Touch likely won't get any more software updates.
