Keychain access to Microsot_Intermidiate_Certificates <body> I need access to Microsoft Intermidiate Certificates in my Key Chain.  I unlocked the key chain using administrator password but still no access to the MIC.  It keeps asking me for a password (that I do not know), and it will not accept my admin password.  <answer88611> The password is blank for that keychain!  In the password window just hit Enter key without typing anything.  *I know it is a stupid thing to ask for a password that does not exist (unless it is set).  FYI, the Microsoft_Intermediate_Certificates keychain and the  Microsoft_Entity_Certificates) is used by MS Outlook for decryption of encrypted emails.*   <comment103780> WTH...did not think of that one :)
