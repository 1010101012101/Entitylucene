Umask doesn't change after reboot <body> I'm new to umask so please correct me if i'm wrong.  We have a mac OS X file server at work with multiple SMB shares. Whenever users create files, they get created as -rw-r--r-- as this is the default umask (022). I want to change it to (002) so created files will have -rw-rw---- as default. This way all users in the same group can access the files.  Apple advises to change umask like this:     codesudo launchctl config user umask nnn/code   After doing codesudo launchctl config user umask 002/code I got the following message:     codeConfiguration applied. You must reboot for changes to take effect./code   I rebooted and got the following:     code$ umask/codebr/code0022/code   what am I doing wrong, please advise.  I'm running OS X Server 10.10.3 Yosemite with Server.app 4.1  <answer268442> I can only guess but I think it's an error in 10.10.3 which is solved in 10.10.5 (or maybe 10.10.4) because none of my 10.10.5 hosts show your 10.10.3 behavior.  So I recommend to update to 10.10.5/4.1.5.  BTW the integer in /var/db/com.apple.xpc.launchd/config/user.plist is calculated by converting the three binary "triplets" to a decimal number:  precode002 = 000 000 010 =   2 022 = 000 010 010 =  18 666 = 110 110 110 = 438 /code/pre  <comment336980> What do `cat /var/db/com.apple.xpc.launchd/config/user.plist` and `ls ...` show? <comment336981> I think this is the holy grail I've been looking for...  The first one shows umask = 0. Should I set this to 002? <comment336984> I updated the file, rebooted but the command umask still returns 0022. Even if I check the file now it shows integer002/integer. <comment336992> That is not the problem. The .plist get's updated but the command `umask` doesn't return the value. Also, try to do `sudo launchctl config user umask 022` you'll see that the value in the plist file changes to 18 so I don't think these are interchangeable. What are your thoughts on this? <comment336994> I meant: I ran the command `sudo launchctl config user umask 002` in 10.10.5 with no problem (- `umask` shows 0002) and the user.plist was updated properly to .... integer002/integer.
