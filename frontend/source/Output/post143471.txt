How to add an IP range to Lion server's SMTP whitelist <body> I run Lion Server (10.7.5) on an old iMac (2.33 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo) and it handles my e-mail for me.  I've been having some trouble recently with delays in delivery of e-mail to my server from DynDNS's mail backup service. I have been advised to add DynDNS's IP range (216.146.32.0/23) to my whitelist.  Trawling the net has revealed how to add a single host to the whitelist (add it to code/etc/postfix/rbl_whitelist/code), but that IP range holds 512 hosts. Also, the Mac version of code/etc/postfix/rbl_whitelist/code contains the following text:  precode### DO NOT MANUALLY EDIT THIS FILE ### # This file is automatically generated # any manual additions to this file will be lost /code/pre  which suggests to me that there is another way of doing it.  Can anyone enlighten me please?
