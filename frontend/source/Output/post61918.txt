Find multi-line block using grep and/or automator with BBEdit <body> I have an xml file output from WordPress.  I have BBEdit as my main search tool.  I am on a Mac running 10.7.4  I am trying to find a muli-line block of text that starts with code&lt;item&gt;/code and end with code&lt;/item&gt;/code  In the block, there must be code&lt;wp:status&gt;publish&lt;/wp:status&gt;/code and code&lt;wp:post_type&gt;post&lt;/wp:post_type&gt;/code  Does anyone have any idea how I would find that using GREP or Automator?  em(Sorry I don't have enough rep to make better tags)/em  <answer257680> You can do multiline greps in TextWrangler using various pattern modifiers (i, m, s, and/or x)  e.g.   searching for  code&lt;item&gt;(?s).*?&lt;\/item&gt;/code  will match across lines.   After that, you can modify your regex to be more elaborate.  <comment71519> [Posting questions on multiple sites isn't generally allowed](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/64068/is-cross-posting-a-question-on-multiple-stack-exchange-sites-permitted-if-the-qu).
