Software update hinders rebooting OSX <body> I'm trying to reboot Mountain Lion but it will not allow me. It just keeps saying Waiting... without anything happening. What can I do?

You can try updating again after App Store is quit.  If this is a recurring issue, try to install small updates first, one by one.  <comment74115> I was able to force quit but now whenever I try to run the App Store it's just the spinning beachball and nothing happens. Can I "reset" some App Store preference or something? <comment74139> Not all problems are solved by resetting preferences. In fact, I donâ€™t think App Store even has a worthy preference file. Did you try to restart your Mac? Are you on 10.8.0 or 10.8.1? <comment74151> I restart brought App Store back to normal. I try to avoid the restart as much as possible :-) <comment74163> Restarts usually solve stuff :)
