How do I access certain directories from the finder? <body> I would like to be able to do something simple such as open up a finder and be able to select files that are in '~/' or '/' Is there a simple way to go about doing this?  For instance, sometimes I would just like to be able to point XCode towards a file that finder doesn't show me normally.  Is there a keystroke or something that lets me edit the path I want to view manually?  <answer140243> kbd⇧shift/kbd+kbd⌘cmd/kbd+kbdG/kbd  Opens the codeGo to the folder:/code dialog in the Finder window:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MtEJt.png" alt="enter image description here"  This will let you open any folder for the directory you type.  <answer140268> If you do this a lot, you can create a convenient symlink or alias to the system / hidden folder you want to access. Note that symlinks work in Terminal, aliases do not.
