I broke sudo - how do I fix it? <body> Apparently I can't sudo on my Mac any more.   precodePiers-MacBook-Air:~ piersb$ sudo ls Password: Sorry, user piersb is not allowed to execute '/bin/ls' as root on Piers-MacBook-Air.local. Piers-MacBook-Air:~ piersb$  /code/pre  It worked before the most recent El Capitan update (the upgrade to 10.11.4), and I'm on a mid-2013 MacBook Air. The account is an admin account, and I was able to sudo before then. My first thought was to add myself into /etc/sudoers but, haha, of course you need sudo for that.  precodePiers-MacBook-Air:~ piersb$ ls -al /etc/sudoers -r--r-----  1 root  wheel  272  5 Apr 11:15 /etc/sudoers Piers-MacBook-Air:~ piersb$ groups staff com.apple.sharepoint.group.1 everyone localaccounts _appserverusr admin _appserveradm _lpadmin _appstore _lpoperator _developer com.apple.access_ftp com.apple.access_screensharing com.apple.access_ssh /code/pre  I'm able to create a new admin user, but that user has the same problem.  precodePiers-MacBook-Air:~ testuser$ sudo ls  We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System Administrator. It usually boils down to these three things:  #1) Respect the privacy of others. #2) Think before you type. #3) With great power comes great responsibility.  Password: Sorry, user testuser is not allowed to execute '/bin/ls' as root on  Piers-MacBook-Air.local. /code/pre  So. How do I give myself access to sudo again? And is this a common problem?  <answer234218> Looks like it only co-incidentally appeared at the 10.11.4 update; the problem was actually when I installed vagrant. Somewhere along the line either I or a script I used overwrote /etc/sudoers with the following rather than appending it:  precodeCmnd_Alias VAGRANT_EXPORTS_ADD = /usr/bin/tee -a /etc/exports Cmnd_Alias VAGRANT_NFSD = /sbin/nfsd restart Cmnd_Alias VAGRANT_EXPORTS_REMOVE = /usr/bin/sed -E -e /*/ d -ibak /etc/exports %admin ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: VAGRANT_EXPORTS_ADD, VAGRANT_NFSD, VAGRANT_EXPORTS_REMOVE /code/pre  So /etc/sudoers was toast. Here's how to fix it if this happens to you.  ul liGo to System Preferences/li liGo to Users &amp; Groups/li liClick on the lock/li liAuthenticate with an admin account/li liChoose Network Account Server: Join.../li liClick Open Directory Utility/li liClick on the lock/li liAuthenticate with an admin account/li liChoose Edit / Enable Root User/li liChoose a root password/li liOpen a Terminal/li liType su/li liType your root password and hit return/li liType visudo/li /ul  You should now be safely editing /etc/sudoers. Or at least as safely you as you can do anything while logged in as root.  Replace whatever nonsense you have in there with a properly safe file. Here's the one I used:  precode# # This file MUST be edited with the 'visudo' command as root. # Failure to use 'visudo' may result in syntax or file permission errors # that prevent sudo from running. # # See the sudoers man page for the details on how to write a sudoers file. #  # Host alias specification  # User alias specification  # Cmnd alias specification  # Defaults specification Defaults    env_reset Defaults    env_keep += "BLOCKSIZE" Defaults    env_keep += "COLORFGBG COLORTERM" Defaults    env_keep += "__CF_USER_TEXT_ENCODING" Defaults    env_keep += "CHARSET LANG LANGUAGE LC_ALL LC_COLLATE LC_CTYPE" Defaults    env_keep += "LC_MESSAGES LC_MONETARY LC_NUMERIC LC_TIME" Defaults    env_keep += "LINES COLUMNS" Defaults    env_keep += "LSCOLORS" Defaults    env_keep += "SSH_AUTH_SOCK" Defaults    env_keep += "TZ" Defaults    env_keep += "DISPLAY XAUTHORIZATION XAUTHORITY" Defaults    env_keep += "EDITOR VISUAL" Defaults    env_keep += "HOME MAIL"  # Runas alias specification  # User privilege specification root    ALL=(ALL) ALL %admin  ALL=(ALL) ALL  # Uncomment to allow people in group wheel to run all commands # %wheel    ALL=(ALL) ALL  # Same thing without a password # %wheel    ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL  # Samples # %users  ALL=/sbin/mount /cdrom,/sbin/umount /cdrom # %users  localhost=/sbin/shutdown -h now /code/pre  ul liHit ESC, then type :wq! to save and quit the file/li litype codeexit/code to get out of the root shell/li liGo back to Directory Utilities/li liChoose Edit/Disable Root User/li /ul  And - huzzah! - your sudo command should be back up-and-running again.  <comment286338> Proceed with http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/229701/how-do-i-fix-this-sudo-permission-issue-uid-503-should-be-0-el-capitan?rq=1 then. Good luck.
