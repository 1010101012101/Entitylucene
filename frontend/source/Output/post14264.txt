Wireless keyboard on iPad2 <body> I finally got my wireless keyboard for my iPad and I'm quite disappointed. Beside the media controls the whole stuff from the dock-keyboard doesn't work on the wireless one. What's even worse is that I have to disconnect the keyboard when I take the iPad away from the desk and go to the balcony. Is there any way to get the soft-keypad back, when the wireless keyboard is connected without going to the keyboard and pressing the eject-key?  <answer19607> Go to Settings - General - Bluetooth and switch bluetooth off.  <answer21249> Your question seems very similar to this one: Re-enabling virtual iPad keyboard with paired Bluetooth keyboard  I think that the same answers will apply.  <comment21830> Sure, but it's kind of annoying. At the moment, I always turn off bluetooth for a second to disconnect the keyboard, as I usually realize the soft-pad is not there when the keyboard is out of reach. <comment21833> Alright I have the answer for you, see my edited answer! <comment21920> Uhm, that's what I wrote. "[...] turn off bluetooth for a second [...]". It's just inconvenient. <comment21960> OK the only suggestion I have is to jailbreak your iPad, and get SBSettings, which lets you enable or disable bluetooth quicker, and from anywhere. <comment21965> Good to know, thanks! I'm not a big fan of jailbreaking, but I'll keep that in mind.
