How to remove "Google Search" icon in Launchpad permanently? <body> Recently, I find this icon "Google Search" appears in my launchpad, I searched online and located this app in this "Chrome Apps" folder, deleted it. However, it appeared again the second day. This is really annoying. How can I delete it PERMANENTLY?  I don't even know how it happened, I've been using Chrome for a really long time, but this happened only a couple of days ago, didn't install any google related apps recently.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OaFlE.png" alt="Google Search icon"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9yDn0.png" alt="Chrome Apps folder"  <answer213053> h3Manual Deletion Required./h3  ol liGo to your user (home) folder./li liClick on Applications./li liRight-click on the Chrome Apps folder and send it to the trash./li liEmpty your trash./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ruG6f.png" alt="enter image description here"  h3If above doesn't help:/h3  From terminal try removing the following directory and empty trash:  rm -rf ~/Applications/Chrome Apps.localized  <comment257249> If you delete it, then try to open, it should show a question mark over the icon. You should then be able to delete it just like deleting an app on iOS. <comment278623> hi, is there any way to undo this operation? even installing chrome all over again didn't re-create the folder ~/Application/Chrome Apps.localized
