Viewer for excel files <body> Other than openoffice, can you suggest a light free viewer for excel files?  <answer512> Isn't Quick Look enough?  You could also try to upload them on Google Docs.  <answer516> I myself use OS X's Quick Look. I think it's good enough.  Just select your xls (or xlsx) file and do one of the following:  ul lipress kbdSpace/kbdbr/br//li lipress kbd⌘ Y/kbdbr/br//li liright click and choose Quick Look/li /ul  and the file will be viewable in a separate window. Press kbdSpace/kbd again to close.  Quick Look can also be opened in full screen by pressing kbd⌥ Space/kbd or  kbd⌥ ⌘ Y/kbd in the Finder. Press kbdEsc/kbd to exit full screen.  <answer786> Apple Numbers can open Excel files. Numbers launches faster than Excel, however it still takes forever and it's not free.  <answer188728> Quick Look can be set to allow copying of text.  Launch Terminal and type the following command:  precodedefaults write com.apple.finder QLEnableTextSelection -bool true /code/pre  Then restart the Finder with the following command:  precodekillall Finder /code/pre  After selecting use the keyboard kbd⌘+C/kbd to copy.

But this Terminal hack works in many versions prior to 10.11.  <answer233374> strongThis answer is just to provide an update as of March 2016/strong  Microsoft Office Online will allow you to not just view, but create, edit, and save Excel documents without having the software installed.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ofinv.png" alt="enter image description here"  For a complete list of features available for Excel Online, check out the page on support.office.com page  <comment485> +1 for QuickLook. You can't do any editing within QuickLook, mind you, but simply for viewing you can't get any more lightweight than that. <comment489> +1 here as well as I don't even have Office on my Mac and I can still view Office documents, and I just use OpenOffice if I ever have to get content out of them. <comment491> +1 Quicklook is really useful when you just want to read a Microsoft Office file. <comment527> I'm aware of QuickLook and it is great, however the view disappears when you edit another document. Moreover, you cannot copy and paste text from the view. <comment310494> Could we make this answer more brief? <comment310496> How well does Numbers cover Excel features and file types? <comment310498> Feel free to edit.
