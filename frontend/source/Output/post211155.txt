How to fix this hard disk on a virtual machine? <body> I have been using OSX on a virtual machine for some time, for developing purposes. From today, I'm starting to have hard disk issues. The Disk Utility Tool says that the hard disk has 107.37 GB, but I am unable to increase the size of the Macintosh partition of 42.74 GB, which is now full.   The pictures are in Dutch, but I think you'll get the gist of it..  As you can see in this picture, the hard disk size is 107.37 GB, but the Mac partition seems to use all space... img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8NsJB.png" alt="Hard disk size is 107.37 GB, but 42.74 GB mac partition uses all space"  In the partition tool, you'll see that I am unable to change anything. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ifv6V.png" alt="enter image description here"
