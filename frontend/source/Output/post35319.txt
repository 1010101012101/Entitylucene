How can I have ClickToFlash except for YouTube? <body> I use the ClickToFlash Safari extension, out of concern for Flash security vulnerabilities and to remove annoyances. However, I do not like its replacements for YouTube video players over YouTube's own player.  How can I configure ClickToFlash so that it does not affect YouTube players (whether on YouTube pages or embedded), but blocks/replaces all other Flash? Putting “www.youtube.com/” in the “Allow Flash on these sites:” list works for YouTube itself, but not embedding.  <answer35321> bmike's comment prodded me into actually, y'know, reading the manual, which led me to find that the whitelists are in fact substring matches. Therefore these settings work:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fOlzH.png" alt="enter image description here"  I had to find the code/v//code URL by looking at the source of a page with a YouTube embedding.  <answer223738> These days, you need to remove codekillers/YouTube.js/code from "conversion scripts" in the General preferences pane. This seems to apply to both ClickToFlash and ClickToPlugin. Note that after making the change, you have to restart Safari, then wait a second for plugins to load, then open a YouTube tab to test.  I believe Kevin's answer was correct in 2012, but the FAQ now says, "Starting from Safari 8, YouTube is completely Flash-free." I found whitelisting both youtube.com and googlevideo.com had no effect.  <comment40237> Have you looked at the sites doing the embedding to check and see if Google is using a pattern of host names you can add in addition to www? Also, have you tried whitelisting *.youtube.com instead of restricting just the www host name? <comment40239> Well done - I'm now flash free so I couldn't test this out for you.
