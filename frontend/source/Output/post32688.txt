Is there a way to get the OSX battery icon to display both percentage and time? <body> I am working on a 2006 MacBook with Snow Leopard.   The battery level indicator has the option to show strongTime emor/em Percentage/strong remaining. I would like to show strongemboth/em/strong.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HYINo.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Is there a way to enable this? or Can you recommend an app that will do it?  <answer32690> h1iStat Menu/h1  offers to display both percentage and Time. http://bjango.com/mac/istatmenus/  When running SL, you could get the old free version. However, it does not contain the battery menulet: http://mac.brothersoft.com/istat-menus-2.0.html  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/x3AP6.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment113866> I've been searching for weeks for a **horizontal** battery menulet that is coloured coded. Please, someone make one? I have SlimBatteryMonitor, but there is no adequate horizontal option. Thanks.
