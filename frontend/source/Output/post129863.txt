iOS sync software firefox beta <body> The Bookmarks On The Go iOS app has a "Use custom server" option where a server URL is manually entered.  Where do I obtain this server URL?  <answer129864> Firefox Sync allows the use of a server other than the official server provided by Mozilla, and it is possible to set one up yourself. The "Use custom server" option is provided to allow for this.  <comment152041> I assume you mean Firefox 29 with the new Firefox Sync? (that's not a beta anymore... FYI)
