How to deactivate all python ports <body> I just started using enthought's canopy to manage my python packages; thus I want to disable and/or uninstall all of my macports python packages.  Nominally, I'd like to deactivate them first - make sure things still work - then uninstall and delete them.  I've tried doing:  precodesudo port deactivate py-* /code/pre  but that returns the error:  precodeError: port deactivate failed: Image error: port py-abjad is not active. /code/pre  I've tried to uninstall all inactive ports (codesudo port uninstall inactive/code), but that didn't seem to resolve the issue.  Finally, if I try  precodesudo port deactivate active py-* /code/pre  that just starts to deactivate everything...  hr  edit:  e.g.  precodesudo port deactivate active py-* ---&gt;  Deactivating py27-pygtk @2.24.0_1+x11 ---&gt;  Cleaning py27-pygtk ---&gt;  Deactivating libglade2 @2.6.4_7 ---&gt;  Cleaning libglade2 ---&gt;  Deactivating gtk2 @2.24.22_0+x11 ---&gt;  Cleaning gtk2 ---&gt;  Deactivating atk @2.10.0_0 ---&gt;  Cleaning atk ---&gt;  Deactivating autoconf @2.69_2 ---&gt;  Cleaning autoconf ---&gt;  Deactivating automake @1.14_0 ---&gt;  Cleaning automake ---&gt;  Deactivating bash @4.2.45_2 ---&gt;  Cleaning bash /code/pre  <answer108381> codesudo port deactivate py-* and active/code should do what you want. Note that py-* packages in MacPorts are usually just placeholders for the versioned ports, e.g. py27-*, so you might want to deactivate those, too.
