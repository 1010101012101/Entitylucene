Is there any wired headphones solution to make calls while charging iPhone 7? <body> There are lots of hardware to listen to music while charging iPhone 7 but is there any way to make calls and charge iPhone 7 at the same time?  ol liUsing a lightning headset?/li liUsing a 3.5 mm headset?/li /ol  <answer262653> Yes, you can use Apple's official iPhone Lightning Dock.  It has a TRRS connector which supports audio output as well as audio input (for microphone-equipped headsets).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HdACo.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer262658> To answer your first scenario, this article covers some options. The first one is this charge and listen device:  Belkin Lightning Audio + Charge RockStar  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BXT39.jpg" alt="Belkin Lightning Audio + Charge RockStar"  <comment329001> A [bluetooth to 3.5mm](https://griffintechnology.com/us/holiday/stocking-stuffers-2016/itrip-clip-bluetooth-headphone-adapter) device may work. I'm getting one of the linked Griffin Technologies iTrip adaptors in a few days. It touts: **Built-in handsfree mic is perfect for video and audio calling.** I haven't used it yet, obviously, so I won't put this as an official answer. It should work, but I have no personal experience. <comment329038> This Belkin solution works great (and I believe is currently sold exclusively by Apple only) - while the industrial design is clunky and disappointing it does the job nicely.
