My Lacie 'Rugged' external hard-drive no longer mounts <body> My Lacie 'rugged' 1TB external hard-drive has stopped working. I have always been sceptical about the USB connector cable, and more specifically where it joins the hard-drive. It just seems poorly designed. Until now it has worked ok, but now when I connect it to my Mac all that happens is that I hear the drive starting up, the LED light comes on (although it is temperamental) but nothing appears on my Mac. I looked in disk utility and there is no listing there. I've restarted my Mac and tried again, but to no avail. I plugged it into my father's PC and got a message saying that there was a 'unidentified external hard-drive' connected (it wouldn't recognise it, because it's a Mac HD), so this suggests the cable is still working? And I have also tested a zip drive with my Mac USB drives to check them, and it works fine.  I haven't dropped it or damaged it, it's never moved from my desk since I got it in February. Any ideas what is wrong with it, and any suggested solutions?
