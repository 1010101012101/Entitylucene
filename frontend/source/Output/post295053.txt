Mac client sends open requests on browsing a directory of SMB share <body> When a SMB share is mapped on Mac client ,just browsing a directory would do a complete read of the files present in that directory.  Observation: Mac client sends read+create request while browsing the directory for which server responds properly  Expected: Browsing directory shouldn't cause files to be read (Windows client doesn't do it)  ul limacOS version: 10.12.6/li liSMB share: Win2012 R2 server/li /ul  Any response is much appreciated!!  Thanks you very much.  <comment372395> I believe this is done to generate quicklook previews ahead of time. This is the expected behavior <comment372772> Thanks sirens for reply!  But the Finder is opened in default mode i.e have not opened finder in any preview mode where it displays quicklook,so i think it shouldn't read the files.  Do you have any link why it's doing it Or some setting on MAC to avoid mac sending read requests on just browsing directory?  Thanks again! <comment372782> OS X automatically generates previews even before you open quick look so that quick look is indeed quick. Are you trying to setup file auditing? <comment373367> Not exactly,it's something like this, i have file server with two storages,one high end & other low end hardware,i move the less used files to low end H/W & now my code design is to move those files present on low end H/W to high end H/W when user actually opens a file from MAC client(where he will see consolidated view of both H/Ws),Now the problem is because of above said OS X behavior less used files get moved to high end H/W just on browsing directory but my expectation is that client should send Open requests only when user opens files, is there a way to off this automatic preview mode? <comment373395> Try this? https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/12018/26123
