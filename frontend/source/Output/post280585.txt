In AppleScript, what is the easiest way to remove all punctuation from a string? <body> I have an Automator Service that is comprised of a single em"Run AppleScript"/em action. The Service receives selected codetext/code in codeany application/code.   The Service incorporates this selected text into a pre-determined URL format. The Service then opens the newly-assembled URL in a new tab in a web browser window.  Here is a string that the Service might receive:     My Plant's Dead! (But, Who Cares? I Have 12 Plants.)   I want to use AppleScript to remove every and any punctuation symbol that exists in the string, including spaces. I also need the string to be converted to all lowercase characters. Numbers should not be removed from the string.  So, the desired string is:  precodemyplantsdeadbutwhocaresihave12plants /code/pre  I understand that I can accomplish the desired effect by writing an individual codetext item delimiters/code statement for every possible punctuation symbol and for 26 uppercase letters. I could use a codereplace_characters/code sub-routine to make this method a bit neater.  Is there an easier or shorter way to accomplish this effect in AppleScript, as opposed to using dozens of codetext item delimiters/code blocks? Such as, one line of code that reduces a string to letters?  I know that other programming languages have a "strip punctuation" shortcut, which is why I ask.  This is, essentially, an AppleScript-specific "Code Golf" question.  <answer280592> Try the following:  precodeset stringToConvert to "My Plant's Dead! (But, Who Cares? I Have 12 Plants.)" set returnedString to do shell script "echo " &amp; quoted form of stringToConvert &amp; " | tr -dc '[:alnum:]' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'" /code/pre  It returns: codemyplantsdeadbutwhocaresihave12plants/code  codetr/code commands explained:  ul licodetr -dc '[:alnum:]'/code deletes all non alphanumeric characters (including white space)./li licodetr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'/code converts all upper-case characters to lower-case characters./li /ul  See the man page for codetr/code.  <comment352940> Thanks for bringing the numbers point to my attention; I had completely forgotten about this. <comment352941> @rubik's sphere, Auto-correct changed `alnum` to  `album`, so it is correct now.
