Is there a shortcut for setting labels in Finder? <body> How can I set a label on a folder with a keyboard shortcut from the finder?  <answer40207> ol liUse kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbdI/kbd when the folder is selected.  This will bring up the strongGet Info/strong box. Once you expand the section strongGeneral/strong, it will be already be expanded the next time you trigger the info box./li liI've searched "MacOSX Hints" for tips and found this which also refers to this:  With Lion you can add a toolbar icon to label a folder strongwith just one click/strong./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/L2WBm.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer40298> I've used FastScripts  to assign shortcuts to AppleScripts like this.  precodetry     tell application "Finder"         repeat with f in items of (get selection)             try                 set label index of f to item 1 of {2, 1, 3, 6, 4, 5, 7}                 -- 2 = red, 1 = orange, ..., 7 = gray, 0 = none             end try         end repeat     end tell end try /code/pre  <answer112844> ol liUse Automator to create a service, add "Label Finder Items" action with "files or folder" selected in the "Service receives selected" option.  Within that same option, make sure its in "Finder" only./li liSave the service./li liGo into System Preferences → Keyboard Shortcuts and assign a shortcut./li /ol  <answer112852> Not exactly the answer but in Os X 10.9.  You now have Tags. Which use text and label colours to tag you finder items.  You can use the system keyboard shortcuts to activate on a file/s etc.  Go to  system preferences keyboard shortcuts.  ul liSelect :The strongShortcuts/strong Tab./li liSelect :strongApp Shortcuts/strong/li liClick : the strong+/strong button/li liSet : the Application to : strongFinder.app/strong/li liEnter into:  the strongMenu Title/strong: "Tags…"/li /ul  The three dots …  at the end of strongTags…/strong are a special character called ellipsis.  Hold down the kbdalt ⌥/kbd key and type a press the semicolon key kbd;/kbd  this will give you the correct three dots …  Make sure there is no space between Tags and the ellipsis  ul liEnter :  your strongkeyboard shortcut/strong./li liClick the strongAdd/strong button./li /ul  Thats it done.  Now when you have a finder item selected like a file. You can hit your shortcut and the Tags menu will be activate on the file.  You can then use the keyboard kbd⬆︎/kbdkbd⬇︎/kbd  to navigate through your tags. And the kbd⏎/kbd  key to first select and then the kbd⏎/kbd  key again to complete  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SeeYA.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment45456> I think this is probably the best way of doing it. I just tried adding a shortcut (via System Preferences) but it seems the `Label:` menu entry is special one, so can't be bound to a key. <comment45457> I can't seem to set the label using only my keyboard. I still have to move the mouse to the General section and set it there. It seems like this would be more of a hassle than right clicking and setting it that way. <comment45459> @KitSunde Yeah, I wonder what a solution using *only* the keyboard would look like. After all, you still need to choose a color. <comment45568> How do you apply this? Do you need to set a custom shortcut that launches the script? <comment45577> @gentmatt With FastScripts you'd just save the scripts in ~/Library/Scripts/Applications/Finder/ with an app like AppleScript Editor and then assign shortcuts in its preferences. Another option would create Automator services with just a Run AppleScript action, set them to be available only in Finder, and then assign shortcuts in the Keyboard preference pane.
