iPhone App for Displaying Email on a Locked Screen with Exchange Support <body> I have an app, "mail notifier" that sends notifications to my phone when I get a new email, it does not support Exchange though.  Is there an app that is similar that does support exchange, maybe an app that does 'local' notifications so there is not a reoccurring cost?  <answer13939> h2LockInfo/h2     LockInfo gives you access to your information where you need it, when you need it. You can strongview your new emails, upcoming calendar events, unread SMSs, missed calls and much more on your lockscreen/strong, SpringBoard or even within any application on your iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad.   <answer13940> You can try strongBoxcar/strong.  You'll have to trust them, though, since the way to get visual notification for new mail is to forward all your mail to a @boxcar.io address generated only for your account.  Then, everytime you'll get a mail, it will be forwarded to your Boxcar address and pushed to your iPhone.  <answer44074> iOS 5 has added this feature to operating system, and no app is needed to accomplish this task.  <comment17109> The notification manager is getting a total overhaul for iOS 5 - so head to http://www.apple.com/ios/ios5/features.html#notification and click on the "lock screen" to see what is planned. It will be built in so no need for forwarding, a separate account, etc... <comment17117> You are correct, a long time coming though. <comment27505> Just hope the server doesn't force you to disable that feature. <comment27506> @bmike I can see it being a security risk having it displayed on the front of the iPhone, the texting has that problem now... <comment27507> Companies will fail security audits if internal mail contents is displayed on a locked computer. If you're the boss, you can make those calls. General corporate policy would clearly restrict this as the default behavior.
