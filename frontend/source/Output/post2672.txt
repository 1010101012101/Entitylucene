Is there an app that will scan a document and upload it to Google Docs? <body> Is there an iPhone app that allows me to take pictures of documents and then upload them to Google Docs?  <answer2775> Scanner Pro supsub[iTunes link]/sub/sup from Readdle. According to the product's Web page, it integrates with Google Docs and     lets you use Google Docs OCR to convert scans into editable text files on your Google account.   <answer28372> DocScanner and Genius Scan will also provide this capability (along with upload to Evernote, DropBox, etc.).  <comment2399> Do you want the picture itself to sync, or are you looking for scan/ocr software? <comment2405> @Dori, sorry, I don't mean synch, I mean *upload* <comment2406> Do you want the picture itself to upload, or are you looking for scan/ocr software? <comment2477> @Dori, I'm looking at something like this: http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-19512_7-10456561-233.html <comment2487> You should have added that as an answer, as it appears to answer your question. I've done so; if you want to also add it, I'd be happy to delete mine. <comment2488> @Dori, the product I mentioned in my link didn't mention any Google Docs integration, so it's not my choice.
