How to close all Finder inspector windows? <body> In Finder, I had a ton of files selected, and I ran emGet Info/em instead of emShow Inspector/em. This opens an info window for each file, instead of a single emmultiple info window/em.  How can I close every info window without restarting Finder ?  <answer94549> Doing kbdOption/kbd+kbdCommand/kbd+kbdW/kbd will close all windows at once.   This works for any window based Application.  <answer94552> You could also run this in AppleScript Editor:  precodetell application "Finder" to close every information window /code/pre  <comment110844> I don't want to close Finder windows, just the info windows. <comment110845> @Antoine Doing this will, indeed, close any open Finder windows but it will close, too, all the info windows. <comment110846> I'm not sure, but I remember doing this in the past by command or alt clicking on the close button of the inspector window. Maybe in 10.6. <comment234526> I just tested (Mac OS X Yosemite): you can save that Applescript line in an Applescript as an application, then drag it to your Finder's toolbar. Click it any time to close all info windows. Now if I knew how to close the View Options window (the one called up by Cmd-J), I'd add that to the script, too. Looking for that now.
