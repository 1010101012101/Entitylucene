Linker Error: leJOS NXJ HelloWorld complains 32 bit JVM unsupported <body> I trying to get started using leJOS NXJ to develop in Java for my Mindstorms NXT.  I've installed Oracle's Java 8 JDK, Eclipse and leJOS NXJ on my Macbook Pro running Mountain Lion.  When I try to link the HelloWorld tutorial program I get the following error:  precodesrc&gt; nxjlink -o HelloWorld.nxj HelloWorld Error: This Java instance does not support a 32-bit JVM. Please install the desired version. /code/pre  Is there a 32-bit Java Virtual Machine for OS X?  <answer177050> Apple's Java 6 JDK, pre-installed in Mountain Lion, does support 32-bit targets.  I modified my .bashrc file which is sourced by my .profile to set   precode# for leJOS                                                                    export NXJ_PATH=/Users/Shared/leJOS_NXJ_0.9.1beta-3 export PATH=$PATH:$NXJ_PATH/bin ## Point leJOS NXJ at Apple's Java 6 JDK                                         export LEJOS_NXT_JAVA_HOME=/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/1.6/Home #export LEJOS_NXT_JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_76.jdk/Contents/Home /code/pre  This points leJOS at Apple's Java 6 JDK instead of at Oracle's Java 7 or Java 8 JDK, which resolves the 32-bit linker error.  I have successfully gotten HelloWorld to run on my NXT using the command-line interface to leJOS, however I still need to figure out how to set things up so that I can use Eclipse to write leJOS code.
