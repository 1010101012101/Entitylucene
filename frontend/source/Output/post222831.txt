Googleapis outgoing connection <body> I have little snitch installed on my mac. Recently I am getting an alert about an outgoing connection to stronggcs-eu-00001.content-storage-upload.googleapis.com/strong. The IP address seems to belong to google. Is it safe for me to let it connect or should I deny it? By the way, I am using Firefox browser?  <comment270064> Do you have any Google apps (Chrome, Drive, Maps, etc.) *installed*? Even if you don't use them if you've run them once they've set up auto update and that's probably what that is, or if you use Google Drive it could be that updating. In the Little Snitch alert, if you hover over the section at the top, a Show Details button becomes available. Click that and it will give you more information. As to whether it's safe, it depends on how you feel about Google doing auto updates. I allow it, but others might disagree. <comment270066> Hi Brian, Thanks for replying. So that is related to Google trying to update its apps? Actually, I have none of Google apps installed... or none as far as I know and have intentionally installed. And I wonder what apps it is trying to update? <comment270067> If you do the Show Details in Little Snitch it should give you more information (it will have the full path to the app making the request). It could also be things like a calendar program configured to use Google calendar, or something using Google docs, etc. <comment270068> I get the following path: /usr/libexec/nsurlsessiond <comment270070> And also /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/CloudKitDaemon.framework/Support/cloudd
