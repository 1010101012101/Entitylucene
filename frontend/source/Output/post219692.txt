Boot camp install of Windows 7 issue, no bootable devices (virtualbox fix please) <body> I'm on a MacBookPro8,1, Late 2011 and I'm running latest version of El Capitan with SIP disabled (if that matters at all)  @DavidAnderson I've been following the tutorial steps from @DavidAnderson posted here Boot camp install of Windows 7 issue, no bootable devices but I can't get the damn thing to work and as a new user here I'm not allowed to post in that thread :(  The only difference I have compared to the tutorial above is that my Disk Number is 2 instead of 1 in tutorial step 9.  After inputting the code from tutorial step 12 which is:  precodeINPUT=$(printf  "f  $PARTITION\nw\ny\nq") sudo  fdisk  -e  $DISK0  &lt;&lt;&lt;"$INPUT" /code/pre  I get an error:  precodeArtists-MacBook-Pro:~ Artist$ INPUT=$(printf  "f  $PARTITION\nw\ny\nq") Artists-MacBook-Pro:~ Artist$ sudo  fdisk  -e  $DISK0  &lt;&lt;&lt;"$INPUT" fdisk: could not open MBR file /usr/standalone/i386/boot0: No such file or directory Enter 'help' for information fdisk: 1&gt; Partition 4 marked active. fdisk:*1&gt; Device could not be accessed exclusively. A reboot will be needed for changes to take effect. OK? [n] Writing MBR at offset 0. /code/pre  I'm assuming that's not supposed to happen? How do I proceed from here? I have kept going with the tutorial despite this error several times without success. The next error I get is at step 18.img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/v5DMv.png" alt="Error message"  The full error is as follows:  precodeFailed to open a session for the virtual machine BootCamp.  VD: error VERR_NOT_SUPPORTED opening image file '/Users/Artist/Documents/VirtualBox/bootcamp.vmdk' (VERR_NOT_SUPPORTED).  VD: error VERR_NOT_SUPPORTED opening image file '/Users/Artist/Documents/VirtualBox/bootcamp.vmdk' (VERR_NOT_SUPPORTED).

I've spent the last 3 days trying to install windows on this mac as I desperately need them and I've spent the last 5 hours on this tutorial alone without luck :( what am I doing wrong? I followed tutorial to the T but I must have missed something somewhere.  <answer221013> I believe you did not receive error executing Step 12. The output you posted is the expected result.  Four days after you posted your question, Tim Harper posted a comment where he had problems similar to yours at Step 18. He overcame this obstacle and succeeded installing Windows. His input led me to update Step 16. I hope this fixes your problem
