How to tell if Mac has firmware password <body> I'm buying a used MacBook Air tomorrow off craigslist. How do I know if the Mac has a firmware password set? If I do Ctrl + R will it automatically query me to enter the password if it's on?   I'm hoping to update the OS X because it's old so I do not want to get stuck. Any help on this is great!   <comment271965> You didn't really read the article https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204455 that was answered on [your other question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/224246/buying-a-used-macbook-icloud), did you? <comment271967> Ah! I clicked the first link and it didn't say anything about it. I see it now, thanks!
