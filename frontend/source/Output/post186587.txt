iPhone 5s iOS8.3 battery indicator fritzing <body> I noticed today that the battery indicator on my almost 6-month old iPhone 5s was giving me inaccurate readings. Throughout the day, it was draining normally until it reached 20%.  As soon as it reached 20%, the 20% warning flashed and strongthen/strong the 10% warning flashed and I was at 8%. I decided to turn my phone off because I knew I would it at the end of my day for a few minutes of navigating on a part of the parkway that my atlas doesn't show. When I turned it back on, it was at 4% and dropped to 1% in a few seconds. Normally when it drops to 1%.   I am able to get a few minutes of use out of it, tops. This time it held on for about 15 minutes or so until I was able to get home and charge it. I used my MacBook Air to charge it and unplugged it when it read 100%. However, it dropped to 91% almost instantly after I unplugged it. It's been about an hour since I unplugged it and the battery now reads 84%. Throughout most of the day I had my phone on and off of airplane mode to try and conserve battery for the drive back.  I have never had any problems with the battery indicator before today and on any other iOS. I have tried restarting my phone but it has not fixed the problem. Is there anything I can do to fix this or is it the iOS and I simply have to wait for the next update?    <comment220317> What makes you think it's a problem with the indicator?  It sounds more like your battery is just reaching End of Life. <comment220336> It really does sound like a battery problem. Why not visit an apple store so they replace the battery? Make sure to backup before visiting a store
