Equivalent of nautilus in mac <body> I used to use nautilus . command to open the graphical folder / file viewer in red hat linux. Now I moved to mac and it seems that there is no nautilus support in it. Is there any equivalent command that I can use. My scenario is like this, I open a Terminal, go to the folder I want let's say /Users/user1/myapps and I do want to use a command that by typing it in Terminal, it bring me the graphical folder / files view where I am.  <answer72626> Yes, there's a command for this, just type:  precodeopen . /code/pre  codeopen/code is the command line equivalent of double clicking a file or directory in the Finder. codeopen/code either starts the standard application associated with the filesystem object provided as argument or, when used with option code-a/code , the application specified.   codeopen/code has some other interesting options, see codeman open/code for more information.   <answer266917> apart from codeopen ./code you can also install Macports and get nautilus itself, I find it better/useful than Finder. Building a nautilus from codegit clone git://git.gnome.org/nautilus/code is also possible but they  recommend Fedora 25 and Ubuntu 16.10 so macports' codesudo port install nautilus/code just might be easier and smart choice :)  <comment334800> Indeed, it's exactly like 'gnome-open .' or 'xdg-open .', one or both of which would probably also have worked in any environment in which you were running nautilus.
