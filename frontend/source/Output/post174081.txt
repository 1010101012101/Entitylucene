MBPRO wont start up <body> ![image capture from MBPro17 screen][1]  Help guys,  I really need a fix here. My MacBook Pro 17" keeps shutting down in booting up process. I did a "command-V" key and this what showed. Hoping this can help those of you that read this stuff.  <answer174085> I know nothing about your computer, courtesy of that broken image, but if your MBP is from 2011, you may have a rather famous graphics card problem. A problem so famous, in fact, that Apple's fixing it for free! Check out that link to Apple's repair program page and see if it sounds like what's going on with your MBP.  <comment204932> fix that image (fast)
