Apps unresponsive directly after starting them. Log says: "didn't gather any samples due to audio running" <body> Recently, I'm seeing the following symptom regularly on my Mac.  I'll start an application such as safari or sktich and then the app bounces in the dock and is unresponsive. I have to force quit the application. This symptom is gone once I restart the mac.  All the log tells me is:  precodespindump[2733]: Safari [2730] didn't gather any samples due to audio running   /code/pre  strongWhat could be the source of this error and how can I fix it/strong?  I have emno/em audio running.  <comment109923> 1) Check the diagnostic files, if any, generated by `spindump` located in `/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/`, hopefully you will find some hint to troubleshoot and fix the problem. 2) Make an appointment with a Genius at an Apple Store, if there's one in your area, to have them look at it. <comment109961> @jaume I don't find any obvious spindumb log files, so I guess it's part of a different log file. But since there are so many, I have not found the exact file yet. I expected spotlight to search the contents of the log files, so that it would help me to find which logs contain the word "spindump" - but that's not working. <comment110474> @gentmatt Did you ever find the solution?  I'm have the same issue with a customer. <comment110478> @NSAddict I can't say for sure. However, there are two applications which have been causing trouble for me in the past because they interfere deeply with the operating system. 1) Sophos Antivirus. I was using it with an on-demand scanner enabled. I decided to completely remove this software. 2) HandsOff Firewall. I completely uninstalled and re-installed this application. Since then I have not experienced this symptom again. Obviously, I can't say for sure that these applications were related to the problem, but it was worth a shot. <comment110520> @gentmatt Thanks!
