"New Folder with Selection" question <body> I'm looking for a way to change the minimum number of files required to 1 so I can make a folder from a single selected file rather than having to have 2 selected before it becomes available.  To see what I mean...  Go to Finder Select any two (or more) files in the same folder or the Desktop. right click on the selection you will see a choice "New Folder with Selection (x items)"  I would like to be able to only select one and have that choice appear.  Thanks.  <answer76125> I do not believe there is a way to change that. However, you can hit kbdCommand/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbdN/kbd to create a new folder, and then drag the file in.  <answer77450> I had this problem in Mac OSX Mountain Lion too, and scoured high and low to find it. Just wanted to share it with you.  Select a single file in Finder, -paste- into the Applescript Editor, and run it. It'll give you a dialog to input the name for the -new folder-.  precodetry     tell application "Finder" to set the this_folder to (folder of the front window) as alias on error -- no open windows     set the this_folder to path to desktop folder as alias  end try  tell application "Finder"     set selected_items to selection      set thefoldername to text returned of (display dialog "Folder name:" default answer "new folder")       set theFolder to (make new folder at this_folder with properties {name:thefoldername}) --added "set theFolder to.."      repeat with x in selected_items         move x to theFolder --changed the variable from "thefoldername" to "theFolder"     end repeat  end tell /code/pre  <answer77465> I would suggest creating a new Service in Automator. Adding a service to the finder will add it in the contextual menu !   ol liCreate new service/li liServicce receives selected  in  /li liAdd a run AppleScript Action/li liPaste the following code/li /ol  Using just a simple AppleScript  precodeon run {input, parameters}  tell application "Finder"     set thePath to first item of input     set ParentFolder to container of thePath     set theFolder to (make new folder at ParentFolder)      repeat with aFIle in input #For each file in input          move aFIle to theFolder     end repeat end tell /code/pre  end run  Save it and enjoy the new service by selecting your new service in the contextual menu of one of your folders.   <comment187099> “New Folder with Selection” also appears in the File menu, where it has the shortcut Command-Control-N. However, when only one file is selected, the menu item is disabled (greyed out).
