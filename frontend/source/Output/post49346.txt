Sync voice memos for the first time <body> I recorded a long and important voice-memo on my old iPhone which is not synced anymore to any iTunes. I wanted to retrieve the memo using the advice here, however choosing Sync Music in iTunes brought up this warning:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dS7N0.png" alt="enter image description here"  I tried to click Sync Music and the capacity bar at the bottom indeed indicated that all music, and presumably the voice memos too, would be deleted next time I sync the iPhone (the blue Audio bar was completely gone). I immediately reverted.  strongHow can I retrieve the voice memos?/strong  The other options in the question linked above include:  ul liDropVox - which costs money and forces me to have a DropBox account/li liMacroplant iExplorer - which is a freeware that doesn't work for me/li /ul  <answer49392> Try this way of syncing. You can also manually update songs if you don't want to lose songs.  http://www.tech-recipes.com/rx/6403/iphone-transfer-voice-memos-from-iphone-to-computer/  Another option would be to email them to yourself.  <comment59307> Thanks for posting an answer, Easley! Can you please summarize the contents of the link you posted. Links have a tendency to disappear over time, leaving a non-answer for those who may find this down the road. Thank you! <comment103889> The email option is best, but if you have lots of memos, get a program to archive / save them. On OS X, I recommend HoneView by ecamm.
