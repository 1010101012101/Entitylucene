MacBook Pro Multi-to-Single Cable Connector <body> I use four cable connections to my MacbookPro: Power, thunderbolt to external monitor, thunderbolt to ethernet cable, and USB.  In a typical day, I need to disconnect and reconnect these many times as I take my laptop to meetings.    Is there any kind of "cable concentrator" that would let me plug everything into some kind of gizmo and then connect emthat/em via a single thunderbolt or USB cable to the Macbook?  <answer215268> I think the word you are looking for is strongemdocking station/em/strong.  Otherwise, if you have a spare laptop and the meetings are within the same building or VPN-enabled (i.e. on the same network as your MBP), you could just use the native OS X VNC server/client by enabling remote administration (or whatnot) in codeSystem Preferences/code.  Then just leave your MBP hooked up, and on the remote machine, open a codeFinder/code window, hit codeCmd+k/code, and type codevnc://ip.or.hostname.of.your.mbp/code, and hit enter.  Alternately, if your company doesn't frown on it, you could use TeamViewer for remote access over the Internet.  It has built-in proxy support if you require that, as well.  If your spare is a Windows laptop, you can install xRDP for OS X, and use Microsoft's Remote Desktop Protocol to remote into your MBP.  I prefer RDP over VNC any day and use it almost exclusively on all of my *NIX machines.  <answer215307> Yes, they exist but are not cheap. A better alternative might be a physical docking cradle where you can plug your Mac in as a whole. They usually come in the form of a "bring your own cables" kind of dock, which is purely a mechanical solution to your problem.  <comment260012> ThunderBolt display? Expensivd, buthas all of that built in. <comment261140> I think you misunderstood my question.  I do NOT have a spare laptop.  Rather, I need to disconnect and reconnect 4 cables from my laptop multiple times a day as I need to take it to meetings.  It might seem trivial, but it's an annoying hassle.  I'd prefer to just plug / unplug a single "master" cable that's got all the others attached to it. <comment261141> I've seen a bunch on Kickstarter and elsewhere.  They're either very expensive (for no apparent reason other than demand) or the KS project got cancelled. <comment261160> @Scott - That's why the first thing I said was that you need a ***docking station***.  The rest of my response was just alternative solutions to avoid purchasing a docking station.  With a docking station, you can connect 1 or 2 cables (usually power and USB 3.0, Thunderbolt, HDMI, or some form of monitor output).  When you leave for a meeting, just unplug from the docking station and when you return, plug it back in.  I work in a corporate environment and do this all the time. <comment261213> The biggest issue seems to be the converter chips which are expensive, and the specialized firmware to make it work.
