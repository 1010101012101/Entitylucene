Lost all my baby photos when oldest son turned off family sharing, please help! <body> My account is the master for family sharing. Iâ€™m missing important photos and want to find them of possible.   My son has turned off family sharing on his ipad air 1 approx few months ago. I only discovered yesterday that the photos were gone but my son says he did turn off a couple of months ago. There are no photos on my sons ipad  now - He says he deleted them.  The photos in question were taken with my iphone but they have vanished and I was updating to the icloud but they dont appear to be in there either.   Basically all of my photos have disappeared from my iphone 4 and the icloud. Is there anyway to get these back?
