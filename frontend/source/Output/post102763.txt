Can an iOS app that records audio also use Bluetooth speakers <body> Or is this an OS limitation? A developer recently told me that his app couldn't use bluetooth speakers because it also allows use of the microphone. Is this true? And if so, can someone explain the reasoning behind this?  <comment120960> It doesn't make obvious sense.. The microphone is an input device, often managed by the AVRecorder or AudioRecorder classes. The speakers are output devices that are managed by a different class - AVPlayer or AudioPlayer. We have to write each separately. An example of where both are used is in iOS7: http://www.maclife.com/article/gallery/90_ios_7_tips_and_tricks#slide-2 - the control center is new, but the concept that input and output are both available is not. Perhaps the dev. had another - good reason to exclude one or the other. <comment120977> I'm afraid that the dev is under the impression that it's an OS limitation, perhaps an intentional one. I don't know enough to comment more, really. <comment120991> Yes it is true. You can have only one Bluetooth connection at time if the microphone and speakers are separate devices.
