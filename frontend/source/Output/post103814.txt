Can't plot with gnuplot on my Mac <body> I am trying to plot with gnuplot on my Mac (OS X 10.8.5). I have installed X11 and XQuartz 2.7.4 and after that I installed gnuplot, but unfortunately gnuplot couldn't plot.   Simple plots like the following fail to render and have no error message to help understand what is amiss:  precode [1/10/13 $gnuplot &gt;plot sin(x) /code/pre  <answer103831> Are you running this from a Terminal window, or an X11 window? The terminal will launch X11 separately to show the plot, so it may not be immediate (or visible). Does X11 get launched at all when you type your codeplot/code command?  If you try it in an X11 window, the result should be more immediate.  Also, if you used macports to install it originally, I would recommend using codehomebrew/code instead:  precodebrew install gnuplot /code/pre  strongEDIT/strong: To check where the output is going, you could direct your results to a file:  precodeset terminal png set output 'testimage.png' plot sin(x) exit /code/pre  Then see if a file called codetestimage.png/code contains your plot. You could also try specifying the terminal with:  precodeset terminal x11 /code/pre  <answer125580> The same thing happened to me, but then I ran   precodebrew uninstall gnuplot; brew install gnuplot --with-x11 /code/pre  and installed XQuartz. Now codegnuplot/code supports the codex11/code terminal:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/J7PzE.png" alt=""  You can also save the output to a file and use codeqlmanage -p/code:  precodegnuplot -e 'set term png; set output "/tmp/plot.png"; plot sin(x)'; qlmanage -p /tmp/plot.png /code/pre  codeqlmanage -p/code shows a sandboxing error in 10.9 and prints some unnecessary text to STDOUT, so I use a function like codeql() { qlmanage -p "$@"&amp;&gt;/dev/null; }/code in shells.  A third option is to use codeset term dumb/code for plain text output.  <answer173946> In OS X Yosemite 10.10.2 and El Capitan 10.11.2, the Gnuplot does not package with XQuartz. Answer in embibstha/em's comment. Much more robust window manager is in emqt/em and it works  precode brew uninstall gnuplot  brew install gnuplot --with-qt /code/pre  Note that using code--qt/code is deprecated now.  <answer175814> In Yosemite,  Initially, I had quartz and gunplot 5.0.0 installed. However, I could not load my x11 window (everything else was file-X11 was somehow unknown). Here is a workaround that 'worked for me'.  Go to the gunplot source folder  precodemake clean;  make uninstall /code/pre  then in the "configure" file  under the following lines  precode# Standard set of common directories for X headers.  # Check X11 before X11Rn because it is often a symlink to the current release.  ---added the location of my X11 files also   /opt/X11/include /code/pre  now run  precode./configure make sudo make install /code/pre  worked perfectly for me as you see below  precodeG N U P L O T Version 5.0 patchlevel 0    last modified 2015-01-01   Copyright (C) 1986-1993, 1998, 2004, 2007-2015 Thomas Williams, Colin Kelley and many others  gnuplot home:     http://www.gnuplot.info faq, bugs, etc:   type "help FAQ" immediate help:   type "help"  (plot window: hit 'h') /code/pre  Terminal type codeset to 'x11'/code.  <answer180546> Thanks.  After downloading gunplot 5.0 and installing under Yosemite 10.10.2, gnuplot couldn't "load" the x11 terminal.  After pointing the configure file to /opt/X11/include (reconfiguring, remaking, and reinstalling) every worked fine. (I was surprised, too, that X11 is in /opt/X11.)  <comment122201> Can you say more specifically what isn't working? Perhaps the commands you are using, error messages, and results? <comment122205> when I want to plot sin(x) in gnuplot, it can not plot and it goes to the next line without any error. $gnuplot plot sin(x)  <comment122206> Please edit the pertinent details into the body of the question. Comments get cleared from time to time and we'd hate to lose the problem when that happens here. <comment122221> Yes, you are right and the last  is not part of my command. Moreover, I am running from a both Terminal window and X11 window separately, but none of them could plot. <comment122224> Then I would try reinstalling with `brew`. It is hard to diagnose without knowing more about your installation. <comment122226> (Updated answer with another thing to test...) <comment122228> Why does replacing macports by brew make a difference they both work - both much better than doing on your own <comment122229> How exactly did you install it? <comment122230> Does xterm give you a xterminal ? <comment122244> In my experience I have problems with libraries and dependencies when I use macports, so have stopped doing so... <comment179383> Maybe I'm slow today, but I spent a good 15 minutes in the gnuplot docs looking for a simple example like this .. or maybe the docs make some assumptions about the audience and I'm not one of them :) <comment180712> xQuartz is heavy and somehow homebrew doesn't package it. I went with --qt option instead `bew install gnuplot --qt` and it works fine now. <comment187933> Option name has changed to `--with-x11` but I cannot make an edit of only two characters. <comment204736> This is not only Mountain-lion problem. This is much more general problem in OS X and its dipslay. Qt should be added as a tag, since x11 is there. <comment205482> Just as a side note, `Warning: gnuplot: --qt was deprecated; using --with-qt instead!` <comment205509> @vitaly Interesting. I did not get that warning or I ignored. I changed the command. <comment205853> --qt must have been valid at some point and then it was deprecated <comment207466> How did you install X11 /opt is not usual I think <comment214468> Why not use a quartz backend rather than X11 <comment215137> Note that sometimes you need to **log out** and log back in after installing XQuartz. (don't know why, but it didn't set the $DISPLAY variable correctly until I logged out) Also, very useful to install XQuartz is http://caskroom.io/:  `brew cask install xquartz` <comment249232> doesn't work for OS X Yosemite <comment254368> Solved my problem too. Thanks! <comment264093> Why not to choose both: `brew install gnuplot --with-qt  --with-x11`. <comment264096> Because of the bug having X11 in Yosemite. Not using at the moment Yosemite so cannot test with the latest update. <comment298468> Just so it's clear. You don't need the  --with-x11 flag if you want to output to a png (or at least I didn't). <comment315823> does not work on OS X El Capitan
