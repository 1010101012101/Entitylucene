Wifi trouble since 10.9.2 update <body> Since I updated my system from 10.9.1 to 10.9.2, I now have a very annoying  WiFi issue : when I click on the airport icon on the top bar, the WiFi networks are no longueur scanned and I sometimes have to wait up to 5 minutes to see networks around me.  Those two have been taken with a small interval :  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YzD9v.png" alt="First screen shot"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SCiSy.png" alt="Second screen shot"  Any clue ?  <comment144172> Do you have a lots of unused WiFi that were saved in your profile? <comment144175> @Buscarì›ƒ 22, gonna clean-up.
