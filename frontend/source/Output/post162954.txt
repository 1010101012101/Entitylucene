My MacBook Pro is connected to the network but I cannot browse to any website <body> I am having a hard time figuring out what's wrong with my laptop. I am using my laptop and my computer, both connected to the same network but something went wrong. I cannot browse any website using my laptop but when I tried it on my computer, it works just fine. It says in my laptop that it is connected but then I still can't browse anything.  <comment190674> Browse with what? Chrome, Safari, Firefox ? Also I am not sure you are actually connected. You are probably only connected to your router but no Internet. <comment190690> Open terminal and type `host google.com`, does it tell you the IP addresses of google?  Then try `ping 8.8.8.8`.  Do you see `64 bytes from 8.8.8.8`? (Press Control C to cancel the ping)
