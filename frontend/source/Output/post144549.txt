Change dock settings if monitor connected <body> I'd like my Dock settings to change automatically when I connect an external monitor, and change back when I disconnect it. I have a 15" MBP and I'd like the Dock to be always visible when an external monitor is connected, but when I don't have a second screen I'd like the Dock to be smaller or auto-hide.  Is there a straightforward way to make these settings change automatically when I connect or disconnect a monitor?
