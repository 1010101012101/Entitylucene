Stop Mail from previewing pdfs and images in the body of an email <body> Is there a way in the Mail.app to prevent it from previewing pdfs and images in the body of an email.   So that instead you just a get a normal file attachment ?  <answer104938> It seems that the display of images (including PDF documents) can be disabled using this Terminal command:  precodedefaults write com.apple.mail DisableInlineAttachmentViewing 1 /code/pre  The display of images/PDFs can be re-enabled by using this command:  precodedefaults write com.apple.mail DisableInlineAttachmentViewing 0 /code/pre  <comment123457> Thanks, ill give that a shot, do you know, if wanted how to turn it back on ? - also is this available as a GUI 'preference' that could be toggled on and off ? <comment123482> I've added additional information on how to re-enable the images. I do not know of a GUI option for this preference.
