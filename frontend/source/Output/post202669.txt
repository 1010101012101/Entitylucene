Does plugging iPhone into iTunes automatically update iOS? <body> If I plug an iPhone that's running an old version of iOS into a computer with iTunes, will iOS on the iPhone automatically update when the phone is plugged in?  <answer202677> You'll get a notification to download and install it. You can opt out of this though.  <answer202687> No, your iPhone won't automatically update its software when connected to iTunes. You get an alert that your iPhone emcan/em be updated to newer version of iOS, but you can just close out of the window that the alert is in. Your iPhone may, however, automatically emsync with iTunes/em when connected to your computer, but this can be disabled by unchecking a box in iTunes.
