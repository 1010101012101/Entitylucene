How can I create a zip archive for Windows and Linux users? <body> In Finder, when I create an archive ("Compress items..."), the resulting zip archive has .DS_Store files in folders and files have resource forks. How can I create a zip archive suitable for cross platform sharing from Mac OS X?  <answer102461> You can use the codeditto/code command.  precodeditto -ck --norsrc sourcedir destination.zip  -c create an archive -k create a PKZip archive instead of the default, which is CPIO --norsrc do not preserve the resource forks /code/pre  I think this will still include .DS_Store files, though.  <answer102467> ul licodezip -r -x .DS_Store directory.zip directory/code ul licodezip/code removes extended attributes and ACLs by default/li /ul/li licodefind directory -name .DS_Store -delete; ditto -ck --norsrc directory directory.zip/code ul licode--norsrc/code implies code--noextattr/code and code--noacl/code; code--noextattr/code would require code--norsrc/code/li licode-c/code is compress, code-k/code uses PKZip (zip) instead of CPIO/li /ul/li licodeCOPYFILE_DISABLE= tar --exclude .DS_Store -czf directory.tgz directory/code ul liSetting codeCOPYFILE_DISABLE/code tells codetar/code to remove extended attributes and ACLs instead of creating code._/code files/li /ul/li /ul  The files that start with code._/code are AppleDouble files (not resource forks), and they are used to store extended attributes and ACLs.  Extended attributes are used to store the quarantine status of files, the source URLs of files downloaded from the Internet, information about aliases (aliases stop working if extended attributes are removed), Spotlight comments, the encoding of files saved with TextEdit, and so on.  You can list extended attributes and ACLs with codels -l@e/code. You can remove extended attributes and ACLs recursively with codexattr -cr .; chmod -NR ./code
