In Lion can I get the four fingere swipe to do COMMAND+Tab? <body> I recently switched to Lion from Snow Leopard (Yah I know, I am late), it is great, the only one thing that I miss is the four fingere swipe that did COMMAND+TAB   Is there anyway I can enable that?  <answer32711> h1BetterTouchTool/h1  can surely do this and a lot more!
