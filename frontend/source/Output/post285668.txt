How to change the spell-check to British -ize in Mac? <body> It is possible to change the spelling dictionary to either British (-ise) or American (-ize) as shown in the solution to this post.  However, I would like to use British spelling with -ize variant (recalled as en_GB-ize in some dictionaries). Is there a way to set this language in Mac?   <answer285679> Try setting your spellcheck language to Canadian English.  An alternative would be to see if you can find a 3rd party dictionary that does what you want from sources like this.
