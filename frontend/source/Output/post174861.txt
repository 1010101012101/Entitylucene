Message icon says I have messages to read but I do not. How do I delete the shown numbers? <body> How do I delete a text message that is not there for me to delete?  The number still shows that I have messages but I do not.  <answer227595> Try signing out of the iCloud account you use for iMessage and sign back in. Settings - iCloud - Sign Out. See if that helps.   <comment206015> Did you try scrolling the whole list of messages? <comment206016> Have you tried doing an hard reset? <comment206028> Thank you for your reply.  I have done both to no avail. <comment206029> I have had the same problem previously and would be confident that it is a bug of sorts. If you don't mind losing all of the messages in there, I'd recommend deleting the account and then reactivating it. <comment206088> Check they're not in the Trash.
