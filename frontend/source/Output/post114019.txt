Which animations will work on Keynote export to PowerPoint? <body> I have a emKeynote/em (iWork 9) presentation and need to export it as PowerPoint. When doing it using emFile : Export : PPT/em the slides work properly, but most of the animations are broken.  Is there a animations compatibility list for exporting to PowerPoint? I found an old apple support article discussing the import, but nothing about export. Ok, I can assume some animation assignments from that article, but it is also marked as emno longer updated/em.  Does anybody has a source for a full list? Or one based upon experience?  <answer209646> Check this page out: https://blog.udemy.com/keynote-to-powerpoint/ Hope this helps!  <comment252891> Answers on Ask Different need to be more than just a link. It's okay to include a link, but please summarize or excerpt it in the answer. The idea is to make the answer stand alone. <comment252899> No, there is nothing about animation compatibility except that Keynote has others then PPT, ok nothing new.
