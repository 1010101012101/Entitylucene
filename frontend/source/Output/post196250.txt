Migration assistant unexpectedly quit <body> I am trying to transfer things from a Macbook Air to a Macbook Pro Retina. I start up Migration assistant on both and proceed with the initial steps, selecting the source laptop from the target Macbook Pro, then after around 10 seconds on the Macbook Pro I get a screen saying "Migration unexpectedly quit. Please try again."  The Macbook air seems oblivious of any issue and continues in a never ending loading stage. Both have all the updates installed. What can be the issue?  The migration is being done over Wi-Fi and the username and password for the user account is the same on both laptops. iCloud is not enabled on either. Not sure if any of those things are relevant.   <comment234412> what are the OS X differences ? <comment234413> Both are on 10.10.4 <comment234414> Do you have to use WiFi? we are talking about Gigabytes of data. <comment234417> You can't get fiber optic Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi is wireless networking, there are no cables, fiber optic refers to the internet connection to the internet from your Wi-Fi router. <comment234469> I am using WiFi, Apple says that it's perfectly possible to do the migration this way, and I don't have a cable. https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204320 <comment234525> I bought a thunderbolt cable and still having the same issues, so frustrating!
