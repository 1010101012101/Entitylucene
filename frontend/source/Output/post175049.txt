How to update MacBook Air OS X 10.7.5 to 10.9 <body> I don't want to update to Yosemite but need to update to at least 10.9 or higher so I can re-load my iPhotos app after doing a factory restore. I've tried both suggestions on here already and neither are helpful.... How to upgrade my MacBook Air from 10.6 to 10.9? Thank you @Tetsujin for your answer re Mavericks...very helpful  <comment206262> Can you please add links to the questions/answers you've already tried? <comment206264> oooooo…I'm such a mac virgin…how do I link the answers I've already looked at?  When I typed in search questions, I used the description 'How to upgrade from 10.7.5 to 10.9 and only two answers came up for that exact question. <comment206266> I get no answer at all :-/ Search again, right/control-click and select "Copy link" to get a link into your clipboard. <comment206276> You can't get Mavericks from the App Store unless you already have it in previous purchases <comment206373> Thank you @Tetsujin .  That solves that question.  I had iPhoto in previous app purchases but it won't let me down load it again until I update to OS X 10.9 or higher.  That's all I want to do without doing the whole Yosemite install/update. <comment206375> @patrix .....found it! http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/116041/how-to-upgrade-my-macbook-air-from-10-6-to-10-9?rq=1
