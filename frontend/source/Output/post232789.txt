iPhone 4s can't keep Wi-Fi connection <body> My wife just won an iphone 4s with iOS 9.2.1 from a friend that bought a new one.   I did a factory reset (without backup) so the phone would be completely wiped.   I turned on wifi, connected to my home network. But I can't access the Internet. Every time I try, the phone loses connection and does nothing. 3G connection works fine.   I have searched a lot and tried all major "solutions" proposed:  ul liReset phone/li liReset Network Settings/li liTurn off Wifi-Assist/li liTurn off Wifi on location settings/li /ul  And so on. Nothing I have done worked so far.  strongNetwork at home works fine/strong. I have my android phone connected along with other devices (notebook, and iPad 2, etc).   Does anyone has any idea how to make it work? May this be a hardware problem?  strongEDIT/strong  I noticed that, we can surf for quite a while and we always loose connection when opening the app store.  <answer232790> The Broadcom chip that controls the Wi-Fi connection has been known to be faulty in the iPhone 4s. I'd take it into a repair shop, as the fix requires the solder to be melted under the chip with a heat gun and it is very easy to mess it up.  You can see the details of the repair on this iFixit guide.
